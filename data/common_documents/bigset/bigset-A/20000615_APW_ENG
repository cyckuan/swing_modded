<HEADLINE> Astros 8, Rockies 4  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Moises Alou, Richard Hidalgo and Tony Eusebio hit
consecutive homers in the eighth inning as the Houston Astros set a
team record with six home runs an 8-4 victory over the Colorado
Rockies on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Alou homered twice and Jeff Bagwell and Lance Berkman added solo
shots for the Astros, who handed Rockies starter Pedro Astacio his
first loss since April 9. Astacio (6-3) had won six straight
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio failed to retire the side in order in each of the first
seven innings and ran into trouble when he walked Ken Caminiti with
the score tied 4-4 to start the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Alou hit Astacio's next pitch onto the concourse in left field
for his 14th career two-homer game. Stan Belinda relieved and gave
up homers to Hidalgo and Eusebio, giving the Astros
back-to-back-to-back home runs for the second time in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Enos Cabell, Phil Garner and Jose Cruz hit consecutive home runs
against the San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park on July 24,
1984.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Slusarski (1-3) pitched three innings of scoreless relief of
Chris Holt for his first victory since August 26, 1995, pitching
for Milwaukee against Minnesota. Holt gave up four runs and seven
hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who won consecutive games for the first time since
May 25-26, trailed 4-3 before Alou led off the sixth with a solo
homer, his eighth. The Rockies had taken the lead on Jeff Cirillo's
RBI triple in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman hit his sixth homer in the fifth and Bagwell connected
for his 16th of the season in the third. Bagwell also had an RBI
single in the first.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Houston SS Julio Lugo was treated for a head injury at
Denver Health Medical Center after being involved in a car accident
after Tuesday night's game. Lugo was admitted to the hospital at 2
a.m. Wednesday and released about two hours later. He declined
comment on the accident. ... Rockies OF Jeffrey Hammonds extended
his hitting streak to 13 games with an RBI double in the second.
... Alou has hit in 12 straight. ... Astacio, who beat Houston 3-1
on May 8, gave up 13 earned runs in his other two starts against
the Astros.

<HEADLINE> Senate wraps up its session ... for now  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Legislation that would prohibit
telemarketers from accessing bank accounts without the written
consent of consumers was passed Wednesday by both houses of the
state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was one of numerous bills passed in the state Senate
and Assembly as legislators scrambled to iron out last-minute deals
before the 2000 session ends. Senators on Wednesday held what
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said was the last day of his chamber's
regular session.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Bruno set Wednesday, June 14, as the deadline
for ''completion'' of the official Senate session, and his house
stuck to that self-imposed date by ending the session nine minutes
before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said he was ''very pleased'' that the deadline was met but
added that senators will be back next Thursday to take up any
unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Senate and the Assembly on Wednesday approved two bills
designed to bail wealthy Nassau County on Long Island out of its
financial troubles. One measure calls for the creation of an
interim oversight board to review the county's budgeting. The
second bill would provide state aid to Nassau County, Buffalo and
Yonkers, and allow New York City to borrow $4 billion more.
</P>
<P>
   The two chambers also unanimously passed late Wednesday night a
bill requiring only self-extinguishing cigarettes to be sold in New
York by mid-2003 and an accompanying measure that increases
penalties for bootlegging cigarettes. Legislative leaders reached
an agreement on the Fire-safe Cigarette Act earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The telemarketing bill targets deceptive practices that
lawmakers said were not addressed by the federal Telemarketing
Sales Rule of 1996. The bill would require telemarketers in New
York to be bonded and registered with the state. Telemarketers
would also have to state the purpose of the solicitation call and
the price of the goods before asking for personal and financial
information from the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the measure would require telemarketers to keep
records of calls and sales for two years and ban courier pick-ups
for payments before a person can inspect the product.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired Persons, which lobbied hard
for the legislation, applauded the bill. AARP's Ollie Owen said the
law has ''real teeth'' and that it would ''fill the gaps'' in the
federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Requiring written authorization for accessing these accounts
puts an additional step in the process which will help protect
people from impulsive decisions they can't back away from,'' Owen
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state Office of the Aging, 85 percent of
victims of telemarketing fraud are people over age 65.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was part of a three-way agreement between the Senate,
Assembly and Gov. George Pataki's office. It now goes to the
governor for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, legislative leaders and Pataki reached a deal on
establishing automatic cost-of-living increases for the retirees of
state and local governments. The package, passed by the Senate
Wednesday night, still needed Assembly approval.
</P>
<P>
   Issues that remained unresolved Wednesday included legislation
to toughen penalties for sex assaults and school violence, to
impose more controls over the sales of guns and to toughen
penalties for so-called ''hate crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   In other legislative action Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   -The Assembly passed a bill that would renew the law which
increased the speed limit on some New York highways to 65 mph. The
current law expires on Dec. 1, and the measure would extend its
validity for another five years.
</P>
<P>
   -Both chambers of the state Legislature passed a measure
requiring pet dealers to provide consumers purchasing cats and dogs
with information concerning the animal's health, medical history
and origin. The bill also called for licensing and inspection of
all pet dealers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   -The Senate gave final legislative approval to a bill to give
people falsely accused of abusing a child a way to appeal to the
state to get their names removed from the state's sex abuse
registry. Currently, people's names remain on the registry for 10
years, even if the accusations against them are found to be
baseless.
</P>
<P>
   -The Assembly gave final legislative approval to a bill that
would allow the state Department of Correctional Services to grant
work release to victims of domestic and sexual abuse who were
convicted of assaulting or killing their abusers. Under the
measure, eligibility would be determined in a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   -The Senate passed legislation that would create a DNA Review
Committee to examine cases where convictions were set aside a s a
result of DNA evidence. The panel will also analyze the
implications of DNA technology to the state's criminal justice
system, and it will have the power to review cases and recommend
legal or procedural changes.
</P>
<P>
   -The Assembly unanimously passed legislation that would make the
46-page state constitution gender neutral. The measure was approved
by the Senate on Tuesday. In order to become law, the bill must be
passed again by both houses in the next legislative term and
ratified by New York voters.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup champions get tailgate party celebration  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) - So it's not Broadway with ticker
tape cascading from towering office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   This is New Jersey: A tailgate party in the parking lot was just
fine, as it was before and after home games.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of more than 40,000 New Jersey Devils fans turned out
Wednesday in a parking lot at the Meadowlands Sports Complex to
celebrate the team's second Stanley Cup championship in six
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman, who was booed loudly by the crowd when
she appeared on the podium wearing a Devils jersey, praised the
team's tenacity when she arrived at the celebration earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are tough and they are gritty,'' Whitman said. ''They
hang together.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also defended the location of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody can have a parade anywhere,'' she said. ''This kind of
celebration is more interactive for the fans. It's better than the
fans standing around to see the team for 10 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Light rain and cool temperatures did not deter fans from
saluting their team. They cheered wildly as captain Scott Stevens
came out with the Cup against a backdrop of fireworks and ticker
tape.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Daneyko summed up the team's feelings as he looked out at
the big crowd, with marshy reeds bobbing in the background as cars
whizzed by in the distance on Route 3 and the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most gratifying feeling in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Robinson, who hasn't officially decided whether he will
coach the team next season, was greeted with chants of ''One more
year'' as he got up to speak. Robinson later indicated he would
return behind the bench as long as general manager Lou Lamoriello
also comes back under the team's new owners.
</P>
<P>
   The team is about to change hands: Devils owner John McMullen
sold the team to YankeeNets for $175 million and will surrender
control July 12. The team is expected to move to Newark after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''In another month I'm going to join you as a fan,'' McMullen
told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team is going to be a model for every other team in the
NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans waving Devils flags and carrying homemade Stanley Cups and
pitchforks formed a sea of red and white as they arrived in the
afternoon for the start of a free Fan Fest with games, food and
music.
</P>
<P>
   State Police reported there were no arrests or incidents at the
celebration. Meadowlands spokeswoman Helen Strus estimated the
crowd at 40,000 to 45,000, based on a count of vehicles in the
parking lot an ''an educated guess'' about how many passengers each
was likely to hold.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters played roller hockey near two giant video screens
bearing the Devils logo as adults quaffed beer and enjoyed tailgate
food. Many wore red and white Devils jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Partley, 13, of Glen Ridge, said he had no problem with the
parking lot venue. ''It's more their home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Schaeffer, 25, of Berlin, dressed his dog, Kylie, in a
Devils T-shirt for the occasion
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Roepke, 35, of Pompton Plains, wore a hat with two Stanley
Cups she made out of casino coin cups and tin foil.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is awesome,'' she said. ''I'm so excited. The finals were
nerve-racking, but they played great.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration also featured a laser light show and video
highlights of the team's championship season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils beat the Dallas Stars 2-1 in double overtime
Saturday, propelling them to their first Stanley Cup championship
since 1995, when they swept the Detroit Red Wings in the final
round.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25,000 fans turned out for a victory celebration after
that Stanley Cup, though their enthusiasm was somewhat clouded by
the team's threatened move to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ''Devils Stay! Please!'' read one sign at the 1995 rally,
reflecting the prevailing fan sentiment. That celebration, too, was
held in the parking lots outside the Devils' home building, now
called Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   This time McMullen refused an offer from Newark city officials
to have a ticker-tape parade in downtown Newark, where the team
will go unless a new arena is built in the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Bayonne and West Orange also offered to host the parade, but
McMullen - calling the Meadowlands home - declined.
</P>
<P>
   Devils advocates weren't the only ones celebrating, either: The
author of a ''New Jersey Devils Hate Page'' on the Internet tipped
a hat to the champions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the fact this is an anti-NJ Devils site, I
congratulate the Devils on their Cup victory,'' the site said.

<HEADLINE> Former Cendant executives admit inflating revenues before merger  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Three former executives blame their
superiors at CUC International for perpetrating years of accounting
fraud that brought a stock meltdown after it merged with
franchising giant HFS Inc. to become Cendant Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal led to the largest-ever settlement in a shareholder
class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   Under oath, the three said their manipulations were done at the
behest of their bosses and that they will cooperate in a continuing
investigation that involves the FBI and the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a culture that had been developed over a period of
years. It was ingrained ... ingrained in us by our superiors,''
said one of those pleading guilty Wednesday, Cosmo Corigliano,
CUC's former chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the irregularities two years ago led to a
one-day, $14 billion meltdown in Cendant's market value, making it
''the largest financial fraud case we've ever brought,'' said
Thomas C. Newkirk, associate director of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   All three held senior financial posts at CUC of Stamford, Conn.
The company merged with HFS of Parsippany, N.J., to create Cendant
in December 1997. Cendant is now based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants said CUC's quarterly earnings were inflated in
the two years leading up to the merger through improper accounting
methods, including underfunding a reserve on membership
cancellations and drawing money from a merger account in efforts to
boost revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't we call that 'cooking the books?''' U.S. District Judge
William H. Walls asked Casper Sabatino, a CUC accountant in charge
of external reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, sir,'' Sabatino replied. ''Honestly, your honor, I
thought I was doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Also pleading guilty was Anne Pember, CUC's former controller.
</P>
<P>
   The three admitted that their actions led CUC to overstate its
operating income by $116 million in the two years before the
merger, and Cendant to overstate its operating income by $170
million for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Newkirk said Cendant is cooperating and that he is confident
that HFS was unaware of the fraud when it merged with CUC.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant consented to a finding that it violated reporting,
corporate record-keeping and other provisions of federal securities
laws, but that imposed no penalty in recognition of ''remedial acts
promptly undertaken by Cendant'' and its cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   In civil charges filed Wednesday, the SEC accused Corigliano and
Pember of avoiding $15 million in losses by selling CUC and Cendant
stock before the fraud was disclosed. They are contesting the
action.
</P>
<P>
   Sabatino and Kevin Kearney, who was CUC's director of financial
reporting, agreed to settle related SEC charges without admitting
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Three other former CUC officials settled SEC administrative
charges they violated corporate record-keeping provisions of
federal securities laws, with two agreeing to pay penalties of
$25,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   In the criminal case, Corigliano, 40, of Old Saybrook, Conn.,
who became Cendant executive vice president for international
operations after the merger, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and wire
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Pember, 40, of Madison, Conn., who became Cendant's senior vice
president for accounting, pleaded guilty to conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Sabatino, 47, of Sherman, Conn., who became Cendant's vice
president for business development, pleaded guilty to aiding and
abetting wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   All remain free on $100,000 bond pending sentencing Sept. 12,
when each faces a term of up to several years in prison, but could
get probation because of their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant also said the 12-year duration of the fraud supports its
contention ''it could not have occurred without the gross
negligence, if not more, of CUC's auditors.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1999, the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young LLP agreed
to pay Cendant shareholders $335 million to settle a lawsuit
brought against it for its work at CUC.
</P>
<P>
   Also that month, Cendant said it would pay its shareholders
$2.83 billion to settle similar allegations. Lawyers for the
shareholders say the settlement was the largest ever achieved in a
securities class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements are pending before Walls.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cendant closed at $35.625 on April 15, 1998. After
disclosing the accounting problems, shares of Cendant finished the
next day at $19.063, causing the company's market value to fall by
$14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant was trading up 18.875 cents to $12.438 Wednesday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant is the franchiser of brand names such as Ramada, Avis
and Century 21. CUC was a direct marketing firm that sold
memberships in discount buying clubs.

<HEADLINE> Bonfire Collapse Inquiry Suggested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- A state engineering board voted
Wednesday to launch an investigation into last year's deadly
bonfire celebration at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Professional Engineers said the construction
of the 55-foot-tall log stack being built for the bonfire may have
violated state engineering laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a complex structure that should have had engineering
controls,'' board member Dave Dorchester said. ''That gives the
board jurisdiction over the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, a public structure costing more than $8,000 and
requiring structural, electrical or mechanical engineering
expertise must be designed and supervised by a licensed
professional engineer.
</P>
<P>
   The board could impose fines of up to $3,000 per violation.
</P>
<P>
   On May 2, a commission appointed by A&AMP;M blamed flawed
construction and a lack of adequate supervision of students
assembling the 2 million-pound log stack for the Nov. 18 collapse
that killed 12 students and injured 27 others.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's death penalty advocates are
watching the negative publicity now swirling around capital
punishment in America. But they insist they are not worried.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois' governor has suspended executions in his state after
it was found that 13 death row inmates there were deemed to have
been unfairly or wrongly convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Two disparate figures, President Clinton and Pat Robertson, have
urged states to review their death penalty procedures for fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, a Columbia Law School professor released a study
showing that between 1973-95, two-thirds of death penalty
convictions nationally were overturned on appeal. Most often, the
quality of the representation defendants received was found by
appeals court judges to have been deficient, Professor James
Liebman said.
</P>
<P>
   The capital punishment system is ''collapsing under the weight
of its own mistakes,'' Liebman declared.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with New York's death penalty law, insist two men who
helped put that statute on the books in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, New York state has done it right,'' George Pataki
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We created a (state) Capital Defender Office,'' he added. ''We
allowed not just access to quality defense attorneys, but also to
expert witnesses and to things like DNA technology. We were very
concerned in passing our bill to make sure that it's done the right
way and ours is done the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki invested a great deal of personal capital in the death
penalty. Restoring capital punishment and cutting taxes were the
twin centerpiece issues of the Republican's successful campaign for
governor against Mario Cuomo in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years later, no one has been executed under the
law Pataki restored. Five inmates are on death row. The first, and
perhaps the most important, substantive constitutional challenge to
the death penalty law will not be heard by the state's highest
court, the Court of Appeals, until summer 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   It will come in a case involving the trial and conviction of
Darrel Harris in 1998 for killing three people at a Brooklyn social
club.
</P>
<P>
   Staunch death penalty supporter Dale Volker, a Republican state
senator from Erie County, said he is not surprised that capital
punishment has come increasingly under fire in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In times when murder rates and crime rates have dropped
dramatically, critics tend to assail capital punishment and other
stringent anti-crime laws as no longer necessary, Volker argued.
</P>
<P>
   He blames such a mindset in New York in the early 1960s for
compelling the state Legislature to abolish the death penalty - New
York last executed a murderer in 1963 - and to countenance light
penalties for dealers of hard drugs. The much-reviled Rockefeller
Drug laws were a harsh response at what years of laxness had
wrought, especially in inner-city neighborhoods across the state,
Volker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican senator said he believes he can explain to some
extent Liebman's findings of widespread inadequacy in the defense
of death penalty cases. Judges are ''very, very reluctant'' to let
a defendant move toward execution if there is even a ''wisp'' of
impropriety with that person's defense, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volker also suggested that defense lawyers themselves, knowing
their cases are hopeless, might be tempted to risk violating
ethical canons and to make errors that would ''win'' their
defendants new trials as part of a campaign to delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can get a retrial after 10 years, it is almost
impossible to get a death penalty conviction'' due to the passage
of time, the death or disappearance of witnesses, the loss of
evidence and other factors, Volker reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   ''You delay, delay, delay, then you complain about the delays in
court,'' said Volker, a one-time police officer who is a lawyer.
''They say, 'Boy this thing is costing a ton of money.' ... It's a
game, I hate to say it, it's sort of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Capital Defender Office is compiling the voluminous
brief it hopes will convince the state Court of Appeals next summer
that New York's new death penalty law is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But it will have trouble using Liebman's study as fodder. To do
so, the Capital Defender Office would have to argue that Harris did
not receive proper representation at his trial - from the Capital
Defender Office.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Capitol Defender Office has won praise for its
expertise and the job it has done defending those possibly facing
the death penalty, office spokeswoman Pauline Toole said.
</P>

Albany. He can be reached at P.O. Box 7165, Capitol Station,

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANLIUS, N.Y. (AP) - Sixteen students arrested earlier this week
after a water balloon fight got out of hand will be allowed to
graduate in June.
</P>
<P>
   Fayetteville-Manlius High School Principal James Chupaila said
the event is a tradition that has soured in recent years after
students began filling the balloons with paint or urine instead of
water.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't see what purpose not participating would serve,''
Chupaila said. ''They were arrested, so we felt it would be a
sufficient penalty in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Two youths were charged with inciting a riot and one with
attempted assault for trying to punch a police officer. Other
students were charged with a variety of crimes including
trespassing, unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   No police officers were injured in Monday's fracas, which
included as many as 100 students who pelted police with water
balloons and ignored repeated requests to leave.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Rattles Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A moderate earthquake shook central Taiwan
on Thursday, the latest in a series of aftershocks following a
temblor Sunday that set off rock slides, blocked traffic and
injured 36 people.
</P>
<P>
   No damage or injuries were immediately reported from Thursday's
quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.7, the same as an
aftershock on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The quake struck at 9:40 a.m. about 30 miles north of Mount Yu,
the Central Weather Bureau said. Mount Yu, the highest mountain in
Taiwan, is about 180 miles south of Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has been shaken several times this week, following
Sunday's quake with a magnitude of 6.7. Two people died of heart
attacks that doctors said appeared to have been related to the
quake.
</P>
<P>
   A 7.6-magnitude quake devastated central Taiwan in September,
killing about 2,400 people and destroying thousands of homes. Since
the earthquake, more than 12,000 aftershocks and minor tremors have
rattled the island. Most have been harmless.

<HEADLINE> Former New York Life executive accuses company of racketeering  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A former vice president of New York Life
Insurance Co. filed a racketeering lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of
tens of thousands of employees and agents whose pension and 401(k)
plans were allegedly used as ''seed money'' for New York Life's
mutual fund business.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Mehling, 50, of Buckingham, claims in the federal
class-action lawsuit that he was fired in March 1999 when New York
Life executives feared he would blow the whistle on an ''ongoing
fraudulent scheme of self-dealing and breach of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but plaintiffs attorneys
said it could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   New York Life officials strongly denied the allegations, saying
they were made by a disgruntled former employee and a law firm
seeking to ''extract money from a deep-pocket defendant''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are absolutely outraged by this suit,'' spokesman William
Werfelman said. ''The charges ... are unfounded and we intend to
demonstrate their weakness in court.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether financial services companies should
invest retirement money in their own products is not new. Federal
law allows the practice, but only if the decision is made to
benefit employees.
</P>
<P>
   Two similar lawsuits are pending, one against First Union Corp.
and the other against SBC Communications. Plaintiffs in those cases
are also represented by Sprenger &AMP; Lang, the firm representing
Mehling.
</P>
<P>
   Mehling, now business manager for a small commodities trading
firm in Princeton, N.J., contends that New York Life raided
hundreds of millions from two pension plans - one for employees,
another for agents - to begin MainStay Institutional Funds almost a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   New York Life created additional MainStay funds in 1994 and
1995, this time using assets from the pension plans and employee
401(k) plans to build them up, according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the pension and 401(k) plans account for half of the
assets in the MainStay funds, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Simply put, without the captive assets of the plans, the
poorly performing MainStay institutional funds would collapse,''
the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a clear case of self-dealing,'' said Jennifer C. Jaff, an
attorney with Sprenger &AMP; Lang.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said that institutional mutual funds are an
''entirely inappropriate'' form of investment for a large pension
or 401(k) plan, which can obtain professional money management
services for a fraction of the cost of the least expensive mutual
fund.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the plans incurred tens of millions of dollars in
needless expenses, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The pension plans have combined assets of $3 billion, of which
$1.75 billion is invested in MainStay funds. Two in-house 401(k)
plans have combined assets of $1.1 billion, half of which is
invested in MainStay, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Saxon of the Groom Law Group, which represents New York
Life, said the money in the pension plans was already being managed
in-house. Existing pension accounts were registered as mutual funds
to save money on expenses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saxon also pointed out that the performance of MainStay funds is
in line with their peers in the industry. For example, the two
pension plans returned 12.5 and 13.7 percent last year, compared
with the 9.8 percent industry average.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the plans have a $900 million surplus, and New York
Life guarantees pension benefits based on years of service, said
Werfelman, the company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents claim that Senior Vice President Jefferson C.
Boyce, who fired Mehling, and other high-level company executives
had a ''special compensation package'' tied to MainStay's financial
success.
</P>
<P>
   The company allegedly told Mehling he was dismissed for
insubordination stemming from an e-mail critical of high-level
company executives.
</P>
<P>
   But only a few days before he was fired, the lawsuit said, New
York Life Chairman and Chief Executive Seymour Sternberg wrote
Mehling praising his performance and informing him that he would be
receiving another raise.
</P>
<P>
   Werfelman said he could not comment on the reasons for Mehling's
dismissal but that there was ''no doubt in the mind of management''
that it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Mehling said the firing has made it impossible
to find a similar job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not able to obtain employment as a portfolio manager. New
York Life blackballed me from the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mehling originally filed a wrongful termination lawsuit last
October. The class action replaces that lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Killer's Appeal Rejected  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- For the second time, a judge has denied a new
trial for a man blamed in the deaths of 24 young Atlanta blacks two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Hal Craig once again dismissed Wayne
Williams' claims that prosecutors were guilty of misconduct and
that his attorneys failed to effectively represent him during his
1982 trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It totally was not unexpected on our part, because he had
already shown bias to the facts,'' Williams' attorney, Lynn
Whatley, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 42, is serving a life sentence for the murders of
Nathaniel Cater, 27, and Jimmy Ray Payne, 21. They were among 29
blacks, mostly children, whose slayings between 1979 and 1981 led
to one of the most intensive investigations of the century.
</P>
<P>
   After his conviction, authorities blamed Williams for 22 other
slayings but never charged him. Five of the 29 murders investigated
by a special task force remain officially open.
</P>
<P>
   Whatley said he will appeal the judge's latest decision to the
Georgia Supreme Court. Defense attorneys contends prosecutors
suppressed evidence, violating U.S. Supreme Court rulings that
evidence must be turned over to a defendant before going to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Craig previously denied Williams' request for a new trial in
1998. But the Georgia Supreme Court ruled last year that Craig
wrongly dismissed two grounds raised by Williams and ordered the
judge to reconsider them. The latest ruling was issued Friday.

<HEADLINE> Putin Probed About Russian Arrest  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin begins his visit
to Europe's richest country, Germany, with hopes of winning
concessions on debts and attracting new investments, but haunted by
questions about Moscow's commitment to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Spain on Wednesday, Putin denied the arrest a day
earlier of media tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky -- widely criticized as a
step backward to Soviet-style repression -- was punishment for
critical reporting about the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the arrest was likely to be among the issues raised when
Putin meets Thursday morning with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We follow with great interest internal political developments
in Russia,'' Heye said.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky, owner of the Media-Most holding company that includes
the independent NTV television channel and several other media
outlets, is being held in Moscow's Butyra jail on suspicion of
taking part in the theft of $10 million in state funds in a
privatization deal.
</P>
<P>
   One of Russia's so-called oligarchs, Gusinsky helped engineer
Boris Yeltsin's re-election in 1996. But his NTV station has turned
increasingly critical of the government as the war in Chechnya
re-erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya was also to be an issue during Putin's meeting with
Schroeder in his temporary chancellery, the building formerly used
by communist East German leaders that is serving as Schroeder's
office until a new one is finished.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has loudly criticized human rights abuses by the Russian
military in the breakaway republic, and officials say Schroeder
will push a policy of ''change through dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's return to Germany marks a return to his old stomping
grounds: He served as a KGB agent in Dresden for five years and is
said to speak fluent German.
</P>
<P>
   His intelligence background and easy March election victory
after Yeltsin's surprise resignation has caused many to question
Putin's commitment to democracy -- fears raised anew after
Gusinsky's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky urged Russia to consider
releasing Gusinsky at least until formal charges are brought or a
trial begins.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as a person like that is arrested, it raises all kinds
of fears,'' Sharansky, now Israel's interior minister, said in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The European Jewish Congress on Wednesday also asked for the
immediate release of Gusinsky, who is Jewish and the chairman of
the group's council of economic and diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it did not have enough information to
assess whether the arrest was politically motivated. But spokesman
Joe Lockhart said President Clinton had raised the issue of a free
press when he met with Putin in Moscow earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think for our purposes, we'll continue to make the case that
a free and open press is an essential part of a democracy, and
that, in this particular case, this gentleman should not be
prosecuted for any reason relating to his position in the media,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said in Spain that he had not known about the arrest and
promised to look into the case on his return. If the law was
violated, he said he would take action against those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sincerely worried,'' Putin said during a joint news
conference with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the arrest, Putin was likely to leave home empty
handed in his quest to win any debt relief.
</P>
<P>
   Germany was Russia's top Western trading partner and biggest
financial backer in the 1990s, supporting the transformation from
communism to capitalism with some $67 billion in loans, grants,
credits and other guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   But German interest in Russia has waned since 1998, when banks
and other investors were forced to swallow major losses following
the collapse of the ruble. German direct investment in Russia
peaked at $347 million that year, but tumbled in 1999 to only $221
million.
</P>
<P>
   German government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Russia is looking to have at least some of the $24 billion to
$29 billion it owes Germany written off. The officials insist that
is not going to happen, and that they will only entertain talks on
debt restructuring.

<HEADLINE> British Troops Leave Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Since they arrived five weeks ago,
British forces in Sierra Leone have been lauded as heroes who
protected the capital from falling once again into the hands of one
of the world's most ruthless rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   But by Wednesday, many of the 1,000 British troops were gone or
on the way out, fueling public fears of another attack by the rebel
Revolutionary United Front. The rebels killed thousands and
systematically raped and maimed many others during an invasion of
Freetown in January last year.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 200 British military advisers are staying behind to
equip and train a new army. Sierra Leone's former colonial ruler
leaves the defense of this seaside capital to a troubled U.N.
peacekeeping force that has seen hundreds of its troops kidnapped
and equipment and weaponry stolen by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the British were here, we slept soundly at night. We had
confidence in them,'' said Bomposeh Kamara, a 35-year-old primary
school teacher. ''But now that they are leaving, I feel we are at
the mercy of the rebels.''
</P>
<P>
   Without engaging in significant combat -- British troops were
involved in at least one skirmish that left several rebels and
civilians killed -- the British presence gained wide support among
Sierra Leoneans after nearly nine years of civil war during which
the West rarely intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians cheered as British warships anchored offshore and
helicopters buzzed the city. Commuters patiently allowed British
troops to search vehicles one-by-one as other British soldiers with
fingers on triggers trained laser rifle sites across the
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the stabilizing force the mission had become,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook promised last week that two
ships would stay behind to provide what he called a visible
reminder of Britain's commitment to its former colony.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, a British army officer said, more troops could be
on the ground within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The British mission is one that almost never happened.
</P>
<P>
   The original mandate was to evacuate expatriates, most of whom
have since returned to Sierra Leone. It was the threat of a rebel
attack on Freetown -- and the memory of past attacks when rebels
hacked off arms, legs and other appendages -- that prompted the
British to safeguard the capital and nearby Lungi airport.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, patrol and checkpoint duties had been largely
turned over to U.N. soldiers. The U.N. force is promising a more
robust response to the rebels, who signed a July peace accord but
reignited the conflict last month by seizing more than 500 U.N.
captives. Although the hostages have been released, more than 200
U.N. troops are surrounded behind rebel lines in the east.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing British commander, Brig. David Richards, said the
peacekeeping force known as UNAMSIL has learned from its early
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Initially scattered too thinly to hold its ground, Richards
said, the force has nearly doubled in size, from 6,000 to 11,850
troops. Communications between national forces involved -- some of
which don't have languages in common -- has also dramatically
improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we first arrived, UNAMSIL appeared on the verge of
collapse and the (Sierra Leonean) military was paralyzed by the
hostage problem,'' Richards said. ''Today the U.N.'s defense of
Freetown and its environs is pretty rock solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Nigerian U.N. troops who replaced the British at
Freetown checkpoints were members of a regional intervention force
that fought the rebels for several years on behalf of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Nigerians sometimes abandoned their positions in
times of crisis, British officials say they are better armed and
equipped this time and motivated by the British example.
</P>
<P>
   ''We managed to get the U.N. to believe that that they could
defend,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, Richards said the British military hoped to
help the government contain the RUF by training and equipping the
ragtag alliance of militias and ex-soldiers fighting the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the government troops lack shoes. Others are without
uniforms and have difficulty in battle distinguishing each other
from the rebels. But in recent weeks, many of the government
fighters have been given British-made rifles and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 have been chosen for training at Benguema, a
government base 25 miles east of the capital, where British
instructors will put them through a six-week course.
</P>
<P>
   Richards believes the RUF's days as a force able to intimidate
Sierra Leoneans are numbered because of the U.N. resurgence and the
United Kingdom commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was an RUF ... I would be thinking about laying down my
weapons and giving up,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Colonoscopes Most Effective in Test  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fiber-optic colonoscopes have proved far better than older
barium enema tests in finding potentially cancerous growths in the
colon.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-year, side-by-side study of old technology vs. new,
barium enemas missed almost half of the polyps most likely to
develop into cancer, while fiber-optic colonoscopes found virtually
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The results cast new doubt on the value of barium enemas. While
still widely recommended as a way to find polyps, they are already
being replaced in many quarters by colonoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   In barium enemas, which have been used for several decades, the
patient's colon is flushed with a solution containing the chemical
and then X-rayed.
</P>
<P>
   A colonoscope is a long, flexible tube that is inserted in the
rectum. It projects video images from inside the large intestine
and removes polyps. Colonoscopes emerged in the 1970s. ''Today''
show host Katie Couric recently drew attention the method when she
underwent a colonoscopy on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The newer test is generally viewed as more accurate, but earlier
studies had failed to prove the point clearly.
</P>
<P>
   The latest research was published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine and was led by Dr. Sidney Winawer of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a growing belief that the barium enema is not very
accurate. We have provided evidence that that belief is indeed
true,'' Winawer said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers did exams on 580 patients at seven hospitals
over 10 years. The patients had already had at least one
potentially cancerous polyp removed. Both barium enemas and
colonoscopies were performed independently on each patient.
</P>
<P>
   The combined tests found 387 potentially cancerous growths in
the patients. Of that number, nearly all were spotted by the
colonoscope, while the barium exams detected only 30 percent of
them.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, the barium enemas failed to find 46 percent of
polyps bigger than four-tenths of an inch -- the ones most likely to
turn cancerous. The colonoscopes missed 12 potentially cancerous
growths, but none of the biggest ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ability of the barium enema is not good enough, in my
opinion, to use this method for the surveillance of patients who
are at increased risk for polyps or for a diagnostic evaluation of
the colon,'' said Dr. Robert Fletcher of the Harvard Medical
School, who wrote an accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher said barium tests remain less expensive and less risky
in the short term. But he and other doctors said the findings are
likely to make critics even more skeptical about use of barium
enemas.
</P>
<P>
   Colonoscopes cause an intestinal tear or serious bleeding in one
in 1,000 exams. Such problems occur in about one in 10,000 barium
enemas.
</P>
<P>
   About 130,000 colon and rectal cancer cases were diagnosed last
year in the United States. About 56,600 people died of the disease,
which is second only to lung cancer in causing cancer deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Risk factors that may warrant testing include a family history
of the disease, blood in stool, or being over 50. The survival rate
is high when the disease is caught early.

<HEADLINE> At-Risk Heart Group Better Measured  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN
<TEXT>
<P>
   A simple measurement of heart wall thickness can predict who is
most at risk of a genetic disorder that is the leading cause of
sudden death in athletes and young people, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, reported in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, could finally provide a reliable means to identify
patients in greatest danger of fatal cardiac arrest from
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
</P>
<P>
   Patients in danger could be fitted with implantable
defibrillators, which can shock a spasmodic heart back to life.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is pretty clear-cut evidence,'' said Dr. William Strong,
a children's cardiologist at the Medical College of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The research was done at the Minneapolis Heart Institute
Foundation and Galliera Hospital in Genoa, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors used echocardiography, a routine ultrasound test, on 480
patients ages 1 to 89 with the disorder to measure the maximum wall
thickness of the heart's left ventricle. A thickening of the
ventricle's wall is the signature characteristic of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   About one in 500 people have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An
estimated 5 percent to 10 percent will suffer fatal cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Former Defense Secretary Les Aspin died in 1995 at 56 from a
stroke linked to the disorder. John Stewart, a 7-foot University of
Kentucky basketball recruit, collapsed and died of the disease
during a high school tournament game last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients with the disorder avoid strenuous exercise. Yet
the researchers calculated that those with heart walls less than
three-quarters of an inch thick are nearly free of risk for fatal
cardiac arrest over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Over an average 6{ years of follow-up, 23 patients in the study
died of cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those results, researchers calculated that those with
thickness of more than 1.2 inches face a 40 percent chance of fatal
cardiac arrest over 20 years. Those most at risk were also the
youngest, with an average age of 31 and predominantly mild
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenge has always been accurate identification. It has
never been more important to do now that we have implantable
defibrillators,'' said Dr. Barry Maron, one of the researchers in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   However, Strong said confirming studies are needed before
doctors become much more aggressive in using the defibrillators on
young patients.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Relatives Continue Fight  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives faced a deadline
Thursday to file an appeal in federal court in their bid to keep
the 6-year-old Cuban boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The family said in a statement Wednesday they would seek a
rehearing of their case before all 12 judges of the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel ruled against them June 1, saying the
Immigration and Naturalization Service acted within reason when it
decided that only Elian's father -- not the Miami relatives -- could
apply for asylum on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous ruling blocked Elian from leaving the country
immediately and gave his Miami relatives two weeks to appeal --
either to the full appeals court or the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives will ask the appeals court to consider
''whether aliens like Elian have a constitutional right to seek
asylum,'' according to the statement from family spokesman Armando
Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue of constitutional protection for asylum seekers is
especially critical for the thousands of refugee children who reach
our shores each year,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the appeals panel said no federal law addresses
whether a child as young as Elian can seek asylum against the
wishes of his parents. Because of that, the court said, INS was
required to come up with a policy dealing with ''the extraordinary
circumstances'' of the case.
</P>
<P>
   If the relatives' strategy fails, it is unclear how soon Elian
could return to Cuba. A court order requiring Elian to stay in the
United States could be extended if the court decides to rehear the
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, wants to take his son back
to Cuba and end the seven-month saga that began Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off the Florida coast after his mother and 10
other Cubans drowned when their boat sank in an attempt to reach
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The father arrived in the United States with Elian's stepmother
and half-brother on April 6 in hopes of soon taking Elian home.
Miami relatives refused to relinquish the boy, so federal agents
seized him April 22 and reunited him with his dad in the Washington
area.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Soldiers Buried in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- When her mother died, Michelle Ngo
sought to carry out the woman's final request to be buried next to
her husband, a soldier killed and laid to rest in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Ngo carried out her mother's wish, but she did not have to
travel to Vietnam. It was fulfilled in Orange County at the first
military cemetery for South Vietnamese soldiers and their spouses
outside their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went to Vietnam and brought him back,'' she said. ''We
chose this because it's Little Saigon, part of our culture, our
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Vietnam War ended in 1975, more than 8,000 South
Vietnamese soldiers who fought against North Vietnamese communist
soldiers have settled in Southern California. Many are in the
bustling Westminster neighborhood known as Little Saigon, a place
full of restaurants and businesses catering to some 200,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery -- the latest addition to the largest community of
Vietnamese outside their native country -- is a poignant symbol of a
homeland lost and gained.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a national cemetery in Saigon, but it was dug up by the
North Vietnamese when they took over,'' said Hoa Pham, a former
South Vietnamese army officer. ''Some families were able to get the
remains of their relatives, but most graves were leveled.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese traditionally believe soldiers must be buried
together, rather than with their families.
</P>
<P>
   Since many soldiers cannot be buried in Vietnam because of the
high cost and bureaucracy, there was a push to create a cemetery
similar to one that existed in Saigon, Westminster City Councilman
Tony Lam said.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two decades of discussion and planning, the
Vietnamese Veteran Cemetery opened last year in Westminster
Memorial Park, a grass field nestled between a busy intersection
and strawberry patch. A replica of a statue of a soldier that once
stood at a cemetery in Bien Hua, Vietnam, is expected to be erected
this year.
</P>
<P>
   There are 300 plots, costing about $4,800 each, and nearly 200
have been sold. They are owned by a group formed two years ago by
former soldiers representing 19 military organizations in Little
Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first buried were Khanh Nhi Tran, 68, and Tuan A. Ngo,
46, both of whom served in the war. Their graves sit side by side
in the shadow of a granite marker bearing the inscription ''To Quoc
Ghi On'' -- a nation in gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ''My dad had two families, his own and that of the veterans,''
Tran's son, Allen Ahn Duc, said at the burial.
</P>
<P>
   To date, more than a dozen people have been buried in the
military cemetery. The plots adjoin the Asian Garden of Peaceful
Eternity marked by a pagoda and reflecting ponds.
</P>
<P>
   The group also created a financial assistance program for
veterans and their spouses who could not afford to pay for funeral
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans' group also wants to build in the cemetery a
similar version of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington,
listing the names of South Vietnamese veterans who died in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fought battles together; we should die in peace together,''
said Dang Thanh Long, who oversaw the project.
</P>
<P>
   Ngo's father, Phung Quoc Ngo, died May 27, 1966, at Long Khan,
Vietnam. He was buried near Saigon. To bring his remains to the
United States, she had to have him cremated.
</P>
<P>
   Ngo visits her parents burial plot about five times a week,
placing yellow flowers and incense on the graves in the traditional
Buddhist fashion of honoring the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe you stay together in death ... like in life,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 3, Padres 1  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Garrett Stephenson remained perfect against the
NL, allowing just five hits in 7 1-3 innings as the St. Louis
Cardinals beat San Diego 3-1 Wednesday night for their second
three-game sweep of the Padres this year.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson (9-2) won his ninth straight decision against NL
teams. His only two losses were consecutive defeats to Cleveland
and Detroit in interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Morris pitched 1 2-3 innings for his second save in as many
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up Al Martin's homer with one out in the first
inning, Stephenson shut down the Padres. He allowed Martin's
one-out infield single in the eighth and made way for left-hander
Jesse Orosco to face lefty Tony Gwynn. Gwynn singled to right,
bringing on Morris, who struck out Phil Nevin and got Ryan Klesko
to foul out.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson struck out three and walked two in his first career
start against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Two San Diego pitchers, meanwhile, lost control as the Padres
lost their sixth straight game to the Cardinals this year. The
Cardinals scored three runs in the sixth inning, with the go-ahead
run scoring when starter Stan Spencer walked Ray Lankford with two
outs and the bases loaded. Kevin Walker came on and grazed J.D.
Drew with his first pitch to bring in an insurance run.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in the six games against the Padres that
the Cardinals didn't hit a home run. St. Louis, which leads the big
leagues with 111 homers, hit four in the first two games of this
series.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer allowed three singles and two walks in the sixth,
including Fernando Vina's base hit to tie it at 1 with one out.
Edgar Renteria followed with a single and Mark McGwire drew a
two-out walk to load the bases. Lankford walked to force in Vina
and chase Spencer, and Walker's first pitch grazed Drew's shirt
sleeve to force in Renteria.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer (2-2) gave up three runs on seven hits in 5 2-3 innings,
with two strikeouts and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Martin homered to right-center in the first, his 10th.
</P>
<P>
Notes: RF Tony Gwynn, bothered this season by his degenerative
left knee, made consecutive starts in the field since May 26-27. He
had been taking alternating games off to rest the knee. He was the
Padres' designated hitter in all six games of a trip to Seattle and
Oakland. ... Lankford made his first start in the outfield since
June 3. He started as designated hitter last Sunday, but had to
leave with a sprained right hand following his second at-bat. He
also has been slowed by tightness in his left hamstring. ... The
first two Cardinals batters reached base and then tried to steal
second against Spencer, known for his slow delivery, but were
thrown out by C Wiki Gonzalez. ... It was St. Louis' first sweep in
San Diego since July 1992.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 11, Indians 4  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Forget brooms, the Chicago White Sox used mops
to finish off a three-game sweep of the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Abbott went 3-for-4 with three RBIs as Chicago opened a
five-game lead over second-place Cleveland in the AL Central with a
soggy 11-4 victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago waited through a 2-hour, 7-minute rain delay before
winning for the 12th time in 14 games to become the AL's first
40-win team.
</P>
<P>
   With their first sweep at Jacobs Field and first in Cleveland
since they shut down old Cleveland Stadium with a sweep seven years
ago, the White Sox have their largest division lead since winning
the AL West by eight games in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordonez and Paul Konerko drove in two runs apiece as the
White Sox scored 10 runs in the first two innings before the rain
came.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Kevin Beirne (1-0) pitched a scoreless 3 2-3 innings for
his first major league win. Beirne and two other relievers shut out
the Indians on two hits for the final seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice hit a three-run homer and Jim Thome had a solo
shot for Cleveland, which dropped to 15-15 at home this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are even starting to hear it from their loyal fans.
In the fifth inning, Enrique Wilson forgot there was only one out
and got doubled up at first when he went to second on an infield
pop.
</P>
<P>
   The lone bright spot for Cleveland was right-hander Willie
Martinez, who pitched three strong innings in his major league
debut.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 10-4 after two innings, Cleveland's players were
probably praying for a rainout during the long delay. After all,
it's been raining on them all year.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's pitching staff is in shambles because of injuries,
forcing manager Charlie Manuel to start rookie Jim Brower (1-1) in
the team's most important game to date this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Brower couldn't get out of the second inning as the Indians
lost their fourth straight and dropped to 1-5 against the White Sox
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland will play a four-game series in Chicago next week.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox didn't hit the ball very hard against Brower in
the first but made each one count. They took advantage of two walks
and scored five runs with a two-out rally, started by Konerko's
two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Singleton followed with an infield single, Abbott singled
and Tony Graffanino followed by rolling a two-run base hit to left,
pushing Chicago's lead to 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians looked like they were right back in it when Justice
hit a three-run homer and Thome followed with a long homer to make
it 5-4 in the bottom of the first.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago scored another five runs in the second on five hits.
Ordonez had a two-run double off Jamie Brewington and Abbott
singled home two more runs in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox starter Kip Wells gave up three earned runs in two
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Abbott has three three-RBI games this month. ... Indians
manager Charlie Manuel said GM John Hart has been shopping for a
left-handed reliever. Cleveland, which is without a lefty in its
bullpen, has three lefty relievers at Buffalo, but Manuel said he's
been told none are ready to make the jump. ... Cleveland shortstop
Omar Vizquel, who got the night off because of his hitting
problems, has not committed an error in 274 total chances this
season or in his last 64 games dating to last September. He's in an
8-for-47 slump at the plate. ... The Sox have been in first place
for 57 straight days. It's their longest reign atop any division
since 1993 when they led the AL West for 105 straight days.

<HEADLINE> Sex counts get man lengthy sentence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Rejecting an offer to plead guilty to
reduced charges, a 43-year-old man was sentenced to serve between
25 to 50 years for the sodomy and rape of two young two girls.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory White's sentence was the maximum possible for the six
felony sex charges, and according to Madison County prosecutor
Renee Smith, he will have to serve at least 25 years before he
becomes eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 28, a Madison County jury found White guilty of
first-degree rape, second-degree rape, second-degree sodomy and
three counts of first-degree sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   White was convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl in 1995 and
forcing her and a 10-year-old girl to perform oral sex while they
played the children's game ''truth or dare.''

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Battle Colorado Blazes  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE GUTTERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONIFER, Colo. (AP) -- Short-handed crews were pulling back from
the lines of a 6,700-acre wildfire in the Rocky Mountain foothills
late Wednesday, bracing for a day of hot, dry winds on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still haven't gotten as many firefighters as we need to be
able to run 24 hours,'' said Karen Miranda Gleason, a spokeswoman
for the fire management team. ''We want to put fresh, rested crews
on the fire tomorrow. We think that's the best chance we have of
preventing any spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters predicted wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph Thursday,
while the National Weather Service said gusts could reach 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,100 firefighters attacked two wildfires that have
destroyed about 48 structures, at least 36 of them homes, and
burned 13,000 acres in the Rocky Mountain foothills northeast and
southwest of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   At least 800 people had been evacuated, not including residents
of three rural communities that were being evacuated Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the evacuees watched from ridges and roads as planes
dropped fire retardant and helicopters dumped water on the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were helped Wednesday by lower temperatures and
lighter winds on the rocky, tree-covered slopes. The 630 Colorado
firefighters who worked Tuesday were joined by crews from Oregon,
California, Wyoming, South Dakota, Montana and Utah, and 400 more
were to arrive by evening.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday evening, a blaze about 35 miles southwest of Denver
had burned 6,700 acres and destroyed 36 homes scattered through
subdivisions built into the steep mountainside.
</P>
<P>
   That fire was 10 percent contained Wednesday night,
disappointing fire managers, who had hoped for 25 percent
containment. Officials confirmed the blaze was started by a
campfire.
</P>
<P>
   In the tree-lined canyons east of Rocky Mountain National Park,
another fire had destroyed about 6,600 acres and at least 12
buildings by Wednesday night, but officials did not know how many
were homes. About 500 firefighters battled that blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Many homeowners received little notice when the flames flared
Monday. People fled with what items they could gather in an hour or
less.
</P>
<P>
   ''My smoke alarms were going off the smoke was so thick,'' said
Chris Brock.
</P>
<P>
   On a ridge near Conifer, anxious residents watched as smoldering
areas erupted in flames and were slowly engulfed.
</P>
<P>
   ''You feel so helpless,'' said Mary Sousa, watching with her
husband, Rick, and 8-year-old daughter, Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities estimated it will cost $3.5 million to control the
fire southwest of Denver, but had no estimate for the northern
Colorado fire.
</P>
<P>
   Record-breaking heat that started in May and lack of rain have
created tinderbox conditions across Colorado and prompted
earlier-than-normal fire warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a 500-acre fire in the Gila National Forest of New
Mexico caused a power outage in Tucson, Ariz., 150 miles to the
southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson Power Co. lines were near flames and the company had to
reroute power through other lines, fire information officer Robin
Murray said. The fire flared up Wednesday, apparently when a tire
blowout caused sparks to fly from a vehicle's wheel rim.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters gained ground against two other fires that had
burned 1,600 acres in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California, a fire pushed by gusty wind and
triple-digit temperatures had burned through 2,500 acres on
hillsides in Napa Valley. Forty homes were evacuated Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 5, Dodgers 1  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Randy Johnson became the major league's first
11-game winner, working eight innings and striking out 11 Wednesday
in the Arizona Diamondbacks' 5-1 victory over the Los Angeles
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Colbrunn hit a solo homer and Matt Williams added a two-run
shot, leading Arizona's offense.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (11-1) allowed one run on five hits and walked two as he
won his second consecutive start since coming back from a sore left
shoulder that caused him to miss a turn.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander threw 119 pitches to win his fourth in a row and
gave up fewer than three earned runs for the 13th time in his 14
starts this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks beat Los Angeles for the fifth time in six
meetings this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' only run came on Paul LoDuca's RBI single in the
second inning, after Johnson hit Jose Vizcaino on the left hand to
load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   After LoDuca's run-scoring hit with no outs, Johnson got out of
the inning without further damage, striking out Carlos Perez and
Shawn Gilbert. He then retired Mark Grudzielanek on a soft fly to
right to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn's leadoff homer, his fifth, came off Carlos Perez (4-3)
and triggered a three-run second inning for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bautista then doubled with one out and scored on a single
by Damian Miller, who took second on the throw home. One out later,
Tony Womack's single up the middle gave Arizona a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Los Angeles cut the deficit to 3-1, Williams hit his
second homer of the year, a two-run shot to stake Johnson to a
four-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Perez gave up five runs on 11 hits in seven innings. He struck
out four and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has struck out 10 or more in a game 136 times, behind
only Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan, who did it in 215 games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: If the Dodgers' Vizcaino wondered why the crowd suddenly
was cheering when he batted in the seventh, it wasn't for him.
Obviously listening to the Pacers-Lakers game, a large number in
the crowd of 27,332 erupted when Game 4 of the NBA Finals ended
with a Lakers victory. ... When Arizona's Luis Gonzalez appears on
''This Week In Baseball'' Saturday, he will have three special
guests with him -- his triplets, who will turn 2 on June 26. ...
Chris Donnels, a first baseman with the Dodgers' Triple-A
Albuquerque farm club, came one game shy of a Pacific Coast League
record this week when he failed to extend his streak of six
consecutive games with a home run. The record is held by Claude
Westmoreland, who homered in seven straight games in 1977 for
Albuquerque. Westmoreland never played a game for the Dodgers. ...
Eric Karros, who broke Ron Cey's record for most home runs by a Los
Angeles Dodgers player on Tuesday night, needs 13 more to tie
Brooklyn catcher Roy Campanella for third place on the career list.
After that comes Gil Hodges (361) and Duke Snider (389).

<HEADLINE> Solomon Islands To Go Back To Police  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- Easing tensions in the
strife-torn Solomon Islands, rebels who seized the capital last
week agreed on Thursday to let the police regain control.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came after Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu,
held last week at gunpoint by the rebels, resigned Wednesday and
unveiled a plan to negotiate a permanent cease-fire between warring
islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope a deal will be reached within the next two weeks,
paving the way for parliament to select a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ''As from today, the regular police will start to resume control
of law and order enforcement in Honiara City,'' said a joint
statement Thursday by the police and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was signed by Malaitan rebel spokesman Andrew Nori
and the deputy police commissioner, Wilfred Akao.
</P>
<P>
   Akao agreed to continue consultations with the rebels to
''ensure a smooth transition to normal policing.'' But the Malaitan
rebels did not agree to lay down their weapons, seized from an
armory in Honiara last week.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels would disarm only after a comprehensive peace
agreement had been reached and the issue of compensation for land
lost by Malaitans addressed, Nori told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio in Honiara on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Malaitan rebels seized control of the capital,
driving their outgunned rivals, the Isatabus, into the surrounding
hills. Both sides have honored an unwritten truce since late last
week. The Malaitans have since been policing the city.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes were growing Thursday that the warring parties will meet
with a committee made up of government and opposition lawmakers to
broker a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member committee met for the first time Thursday, but was
not yet ready to announce when talks between the rebel factions
might take place, said committee member Fred Fono, Solomons'
minister of development planning.
</P>
<P>
   An Australian warship has moved closer to Solomons' coast and
may be used as a neutral venue for the peace talks or for
parliament, the Australian Defense Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The amphibious landing ship HMAS Manoora, carrying about 200
troops and two Black Hawk helicopters, had previously been anchored
out of sight of the Solomons, overseeing the evacuation of
expatriate Australians fleeing unrest in the South Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
   It had now entered Solomons' territorial waters about two hours
sailing time from Honiara, a department spokesman said on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu has criticized Australia and New Zealand, the two
regional powers, for being too passive in their response to the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries rejected his government's appeals to send in
troops to bring order to the Solomons, saying local leaders must
reach a peace agreement first.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict revolves around a land dispute. Isatabus, the
indigenous residents of the Solomons' main island of Guadalcanal,
have forced out migrants from the nearby island of Malaita. About
20,000 Malaitans have been expelled over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu, who is now acting as caretaker leader, has warned
that the conflict risks splintering the Solomons, which has been
self-governing since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Malaitan spokesman Nori said Ulufa'alu's action had put the
Solomons on a fast track to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth foreign ministers, including from Australia and New
Zealand, had talked about giving financial support to compensate
for land losses, but no firm offer was made, Nori said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Tee, a leader for the Isatabu rebels, expressed
disappointment Ulufa'alu had been forced out of office.
</P>
<P>
   But Tee said the Isatabu forces would keep the peace even after
a 14-day cease-fire ends next Saturday, as long as the Malaitans
do.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they fight, we fight. If they sit down, we sit down,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ulufa'alu urged the Malaitan rebels -- who number
about 500 fighters inside the capital -- to return their weapons so
lawmakers won't be intimidated when parliament reconvenes.
</P>
<P>
   The joint statement by the police and the Malaitan rebels said
arrangements were underway for the rebels to return police vehicles
so that normal patrols could resume.
</P>
<P>
   A curfew will remain in place until police have the capacity to
take full control of security, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The Solomon Islands lie 1,600 miles northeast of Sydney,
Australia, and were the scene of battles between the United States
and Japan during World War II.

<HEADLINE> Nassau Bailout Package OK'd  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state Legislature has voted to bail out
one of the wealthiest counties in America, approving a measure
expected to be signed by Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The Nassau County aid package is designed to get the Long Island
county out from under a shortfall of more than $100 million that is
projected to grow to more than $300 million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The county counts some of the wealthiest residents in New York
among the 1.3 million people in its boundaries just east of New
York City. Its median annual income of $58,155 is among the highest
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County is facing an ultimatum from Wall Street: correct
its finances by June 30 or face a devaluation of its bond rating to
junk status.
</P>
<P>
   There are also strong political overtones to the issue.
Republicans have lost control to Democrats of the state Legislature
in Nassau County, apparently due to the financial morass, for the
first time since World War I. Republicans in the Senate need to
return several members from the county to their chamber this
November to maintain the GOP's majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal approved Wednesday, the county has agreed to make
about $200 million in spending cuts over the next four years while
state taxpayers will contribute $105 million to the county.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-member, state-appointed board will oversee county
finances and take direct budget control if local officials fail to
take a fiscally prudent course.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say county administrators and officials got into fiscal
trouble by going eight of the past 10 years without raising
property taxes. In the meantime, county expenses and the cost of
labor contracts continued to go up.

<HEADLINE> Alligator Attacks Puppy in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEMINOLE, Fla. (AP) -- Three young sisters whose family had just
moved here from Virginia could do nothing but watch as their
Dalmatian puppy bounded out into a lake and was killed by an
alligator.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are devastated,'' said Valerie Callaway, the girls' mother.
''We don't have alligators in Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls tried to call the 46-pound dog back when they spotted
the alligator, but the dog was too interested in some ducks
swimming nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to a lakeside apartment in March from Dale
City, Va., while they waited for a new home to be built. Sandi had
been a Christmas present for the family's youngest daughter,
4-year-old Rebecca, a fan of the Disney movie ''101 Dalmatians.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca and her two older sisters, Cassandra, 15, and Madison,
8, watched Monday as Sandi darted through an open screen door to
the lake. The girls then spotted the alligator slowly swimming
toward the dog before it suddenly sped up.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Morse, a spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission, said the alligator has been a problem
before and will be removed from the area and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may have lost its fear of people and that's a chance we
don't take,'' he said. ''Other dogs or small children might become
prey items because of their relative size.''
</P>
<P>
   The Callaways said they will seek grief counseling for their
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The alligator attack was one of dozens involving pets every year
in Florida, according to the Conservation Commission. The state
only records attacks against humans. In 52 years alligators have
attacked 265 people. Nine victims have died.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Booming in Japan  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Zero-interest Japan is where a lot of interest is
these days for multinational companies looking to sell corporate
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In March last year, Japan's central bank cut a key interest rate
almost to zero in an effort to jump-start its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months later, the economy is still sputtering.
</P>
<P>
   But sales of foreign corporate bonds in yen are booming thanks
to the Bank of Japan's near-zero interest rate policy, which has
allowed U.S. and European companies to raise money cheaper in Japan
then they can at home.
</P>
<P>
   For Japanese money managers, the yen-denominated bonds recently
sold by the likes of IBM and Xerox Corp. offer a low-risk way out
of their low-return doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ''Japanese investors have money but no place to invest it,''
said Yoshihara Matsushima, deputy general manager of the
international finance department at Daiwa Securities SB Capital
Markets Co.
</P>
<P>
   Daiwa helped underwrite $1.31 billion worth of yen-denominated
bonds issued Wednesday by IBM.
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest-ever sale of yen-denominated bonds, or
''samurai bonds,'' by a foreign company, topping the $1.22 billion
worth floated last month by Xerox's finance unit.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year IBM bond pays 0.62 percent interest -- 21.5 basis
points higher than Japanese government bonds with similar maturity.
One hundred basis points are equal to 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's cheap from the U.S. computer-maker's perspective but
looks attractive to investors in this country, said Yoshio Shima,
director of credit research at Credit Suisse First Boston
Securities (Japan).
</P>
<P>
   Low-risk Japanese corporate bonds such as utilities pay only
around 18 basis points more than the yield on government bonds, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Postal savings accounts, run by the government, were once
extremely popular with savers here. But they are no longer anything
to write home about with interest rates at less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More than $938.4 billion now in 10-year postal saving accounts
is set to mature over the next two years, and a lot of that money
will probably find its way into stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies are lining up to cash in.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. nonbank lender Household International and Italian
automaker Fiat are among the big names getting ready to float
yen-denominated bonds.
</P>
<P>
   And they're anxious to get in while the getting is good,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan is expected to begin guiding interest rates
back up as soon as the nation starts to crawl out of its deepest
slump in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''So there is a big incentive for the debt issuer to issue right
now,'' said Credit Suisse's Shima.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan has kept its overnight loan rate at about 0.02
percent to 0.03 percent since March of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Another incentive for some foreign companies to raise money in
Japan is the need to spend it here.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economic woes have given overseas multinationals
unprecedented opportunities to acquire Japanese assets on the cheap
and to expand their presence in this hard-to-crack market.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners invested a record $13.1 billion in Japan in 1999,
more than triple the previous year -- a trend symbolized by French
automaker Renault SA's purchase of a controlling stake in Nissan
Motor Co.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Mob on Wall Street, Bjt,910  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The mob will not be allowed to settle down on
Wall Street, authorities insisted after revealing that organized
crime had a central role in crimes resulting in charges against
more than 100 people in the country's largest crackdown yet on
securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public should be assured that the FBI has and will remain
vigilant against the mob's use of our financial markets as their
playground,'' said Barry W. Mawn, FBI assistant director in charge
of the New York office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's actions are not an indication that the tentacles of
organized crime have reached anywhere beyond the seamy underbelly''
of the penny stock market, said Richard Walker, director of
enforcement of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White announced at a Wednesday news
conference the unsealing in U.S. District Court in Manhattan of 16
indictments and seven criminal complaints detailing various stock
rip-off schemes, many of which had the strongarm of mobsters behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   White said guilty verdicts could lead to prison terms of between
five and 80 years for defendants including a former New York police
detective, a West Coast investment adviser, stock promoters,
brokers, and officers, directors and other insiders of several
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The participants allegedly engaged in racketeering, conspiring
to use bribery, extortion and even soliciting murder to further
frauds reaping more than $50 million in illegal profits. Many more
millions of dollars would have been lost if the arrests had not
been made, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 120 people named in court papers were members of all
five New York crime families, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, 98 suspects had been arrested in New Jersey, New
York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, Texas, Illinois, Utah and California, and more
arrests were expected.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments accuse them of engaging in racketeering,
conspiring to use bribery, extortion and even soliciting murder to
further frauds reaping more than $50 million in illegal profits.
Authorities said no one was killed.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, stock brokers were bribed to push worthless
stocks, often through cold calling, in an effort to bid up prices
for their own gain, Walker said. He said the 120 suspects
''otherwise lied, cheated or stole from innocent investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who reneged on a deal was subjected to beatings,
intimidation and threats, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Mawn said the mob's tactics were nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter what market the mob tries to infiltrate, from the
fish market to the stock market, the methods it uses are always the
same: violence and the threat of violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the overall scheme, the Internet was sometimes used
to promote stocks, and companies were falsely touted as dot.com
companies to induce investors to capitalize on the Internet boom,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in two companies Walker described as ''the latest
e-commerce wonders'' was suspended Wednesday by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, prosecutors said the FBI learned about the
illegal schemes by secretly recordings about 1,000 hours of
conversations at a DMN Capital Investments Inc., a company White
described as an ''investment banker to the crooked and the
corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the company offered ''its services to anyone and any
deal as long as it was illicit.''
</P>
<P>
   The company allegedly was a New York launchpad for a variety of
schemes involving alleged mobsters who sought to secretly control
or infiltrate various New York City brokerage firms, White said.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone call to DMN seeking comment Wednesday was not
answered.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Cary F. Cimino, a New York stock
promoter, arranged for secret bribes to be paid to corrupt brokers
and last year allegedly solicited the murder of a person he
believed to be a cooperating witness.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the racketeering machine allegedly tried to
defraud union pension funds by employing corrupt securities
industry professionals to manage union pension funds and taking
kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme recruited an allegedly corrupt money manager, William
P. Stephens, the chief investment officer of Husic Capital
Management, a San Francisco investment adviser, who allegedly
agreed to manage up to $300 million in union pension funds so that
some could be kicked back illegally, prosecutors alleged.
</P>
<P>
   It also recruited a former New York City detective, Stephen E.
Gardell, so it could gain illegal kickbacks from the Detectives'
Endowment Association, which serves New York City detectives,
prosecutors alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Gardell leaked confidential law enforcement
information concerning organized crime investigations to members
and associates of organized crime and provided New York City law
enforcement parking permits to alleged mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   In return, prosecutors said, Gardell receive cash and property,
including $8,000 to build at swimming pool at his home, trips to
Las Vegas and Atlantic City and a fur coat.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Gardell was released on $500,000 bail after his
lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, told a U.S. magistrate judge that his
client ''maintains his innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardell, greeted by friends and family as he left court,
declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Texas, Oklahoma Execute Killers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A murderer and twice-convicted burglar
was executed by injection Wednesday for killing a Waco tortilla
shop owner during a 1989 robbery.
</P>
<P>
   It was the state's 21st execution this year and the second of
three scheduled this week. A few hours later, Oklahoma executed a
man who beat and burned his wife's lover to death in a plot to
collect an insurance settlement.
</P>
<P>
   John Albert Burks, 44, was on parole when he walked into Jesse's
Tortilla Factory in Waco early Jan. 20, 1989, demanded money and
then shot Jesse Contreras as the 63-year-old store owner tried to
throw a trash can at him.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras was hit four times and died 27 days later.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Burks, who grew up near the tortilla
shop, denied any involvement. He said he was in the Rio Grande
Valley, 370 miles away, at the time of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses testified that they saw Burks leave the scene and flee
in a car police determined belonged to his half-brother.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't hold any grudge against him,'' said Contreras' widow,
Esther Contreras. ''I can't say that he did do it or that he didn't
do it. But the fellows who were with him told off on him and they
said he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief final statement, Burks greeted some relatives who
served as witnesses and told them it was ''going to be all right.''
Then he told the warden, ''it's going down, let's get it over with.
Y'all take care.''
</P>
<P>
   In McAlester, Okla., William Clifford Bryson, 29, was executed
by injection early Thursday for his part in the 1988 murder of
James Plantz, 33. He became the ninth Oklahoma prisoner put to
death this year.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Bryson and Marilyn Plantz planned to collect an
insurance policy of about $300,000 for Plantz's accidental death.
Mrs. Plantz was the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 26, 1988, Bryson, then 18, and friend Clinton McKimble
surprised Plantz in his house and beat him with two baseball bats
provided by Plantz's wife, who also was present, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   McKimble, who received a life sentence for testifying against
Bryson, said Mrs. Plantz looked at her husband's head injuries from
the beating and remarked that it didn't look like an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''She told us to burn him,'' McKimble testified.
</P>
<P>
   Plantz was loaded into a pickup truck and driven to a remote
area, where he and the vehicle were doused with gasoline and set
ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Plantz was sentenced to death and is awaiting execution.

<HEADLINE> Judge Strikes La. School Prayer Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROE, La. (AP) -- A federal judge on Wednesday struck down a
Louisiana law that allows public schools to set aside time for
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   A 1976 law initially allowed for silent meditation. It was
amended in 1992 to include the word ''prayer'' and again last year
to remove the word ''silent.''
</P>
<P>
   The change to verbal prayer amounted to an unconstitutional
endorsement of religion by the Legislature, federal Judge Robert
James ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court recognized in its decision that the Louisiana
Legislature cannot authorize the prayers of the majority to be
foisted upon nonbelievers,'' said Ayesha Khan, an attorney for
Washington, D.C.-based Americans United for Separation of Church
and State, which joined the American Civil Liberties Union in
challenging the law.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling stemmed from the case Doe vs. Ouachita Parish School
Board, filed by the mother of a ninth-grader at West Monroe High
School, about 30 miles south of the Arkansas border. The woman,
identified only as ''Jane Doe,'' claimed in the lawsuit that other
students had made fun of her son and another boy who didn't
participate in prayer activities, taunting them and calling them
''atheist'' and ''devil worshipper.''
</P>
<P>
   State lawyers argued that the law specifically states it is
neutral toward religion, and asked the judge to dismiss the case
without trial. The judge declined. The lawsuit is scheduled to be
tried before James on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''This statute cannot help but create the appearance that the
state of Louisiana is endorsing religion since the state has
created a venue for public prayer in public facilities under the
supervision of public officials,'' the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. Mike Foster said he could not immediately
comment because his staff had not reviewed the ruling. It was not
immediately clear whether the state would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A message left at the office of the Ouachita Parish School Board
after the ruling Wednesday also was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Americans United director the Rev. Barry Lynn said the ruling
should discourage lawmakers nationwide from attempting to sanction
prayer in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sends a clear message that government can't tell public
school students when and how to pray,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lakers One Win Away From Title  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Robert Horry was nearly a goat, turning the
ball over in the final seconds of the fourth quarter Wednesday
night in Game 4 of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   He got a reprieve, and turned out to be one of the Los Angeles
Lakers' heroes as they moved within one victory of their first
championship in 12 years, the final days of Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Horry scored the first four points of overtime to put the Lakers
ahead for good in a 120-118 victory over the Indiana Pacers on
Wednesday night, giving them a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers had a chance to win the game on Reggie Miller's
last-gasp 3-pointer, but Horry got a slight piece of the ball,
which wound up bouncing off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps with it Indiana's chances at winning a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a golden opportunity, we've got three chances to win
once,'' Horry said. ''I'm just happy to be in this situation, I
like our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   And he should. No team has ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in
the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Lakers win Friday night at Conseco Fieldhouse or once
in two potential games at Staples Center next week, Horry would
pick up his third championship ring. He played for the champion
Houston Rockets in 1993-94 and 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   Horry shrugged off the turnover, which occurred with 17.4
seconds left and the game tied 104-all. His errant pass was
intended for Glen Rice but went out of bounds under the Lakers'
basket.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was hoping we were going to get a foul on that,'' said
Horry, who had 17 points and six rebounds to support stars
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. ''They pulled him, it went out of
bounds. That's just a part of the game. It was no big deal; you
turn it over, you turn it over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was smiling the whole game, I felt good. Whatever happens,
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the turnover, Indiana's Travis Best threw up an air
ball, and after O'Neal's desperation hook at the buzzer missed, the
teams went to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did the thing nobody should try to do -- shoot over Shaq,''
Horry said of Best.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won despite the fact that O'Neal fouled out with 2:33
left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 36 points and 21 rebounds and Bryant, obviously
showing no ill effects of the sprained left ankle that kept him out
of Game 3, scored 22 of his 28 points after halftime and played 47
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's follow shot with 5.9 seconds left were the final Los
Angeles points, giving him eight in the overtime and putting the
Lakers ahead 120-117.
</P>
<P>
   After Rick Fox fouled Jalen Rose before the ball was inbounded,
Miller made a foul shot and the Pacers kept possession. With a
little help from Horry, Miller then missed the shot that could have
tied the Finals 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he popped out, I just ran out there,'' Horry said. ''I
got a piece of it, not enough to stop the flight. We were very
fortunate it didn't go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Miller: ''Robert Horry was running at me. I had to shoot it
higher, over his hands. It was right on target, it was just
short.''
</P>
<P>
   With the sellout crowd of 18,345 chanting ''Beat LA, Beat LA,''
the Pacers went on a 12-2 run early in the fourth quarter to go
ahead 89-84.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers would battle back.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant got off to a slow start, getting two points, two assists
and two turnovers in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up his fourth foul just 1:03 into the third quarter,
but played on and, in the end, brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Robert Horry was very good for us tonight, but Kobe smelled it
at the end of the game, his opportunity when Shaq was out, and
lifted us,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ''They have to beat us
three in a row to win. That's what the situation really says right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, an NBA-best 67-15 during the regular season, haven't
lost three straight since being eliminated by San Antonio in the
second round of last year's playoffs.

<HEADLINE> FCC Seeks To Conserve Airwaves  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The burgeoning popularity of mobile phones, pagers
and wireless
devices has put a squeeze on the nation's airwaves. Now,
communications regulators are looking for new ways to get the most
mileage out of existing frequencies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ultra-wideband technology offers one solution since it can
operate over a wide swath of the airwaves and in areas occupied by
other radio services.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also is looking at:
</P>
<P>
   --Software defined radio, a technology that enables devices to
seek out pockets of airwaves that are not being used locally and
adapt to those frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   --Creating a secondary market so that slices of the airwaves will
be treated like other commodities that flow in the marketplace. The
Federal Communications Commission wants to move to a system in
which companies that have unused frequencies can sell them to those
who need them at the moment. This would create a spot market akin
to those that exist for petroleum or pork bellies. The commission
recently held its first forum on how to make such a transition.
</P>
<P>
   --Developing a new class of commercial licensees called ''guard
band managers.'' These managers would receive their licenses
through the normal bidding process. But they could then turn around
and lease slices of the airwaves to commercial service providers or
third parties.

<HEADLINE> Administration Split on Media Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sponsors of legislation to make disclosing
classified information to the news media a felony punishable by up
to three years in prison agreed to take a closer look on Wednesday
after strong objections were lodged by Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee and principal sponsor of the measure, said
he had no intentions of weakening the proposed legislation, which
has already been approved by his panel and is awaiting a vote by
the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We basically agree that we need a tougher criminal statute,''
Shelby told reporters after his committee met behind closed doors
with Reno, CIA Director George Tenet and FBI Director Louis Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposes the legislation, approved by
the Senate panel last April as part of its annual legislation
authorizing programs for the coming fiscal year for the CIA, the
National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Reno, Tenet nor Freeh spoke with reporters as they left
the committee room.
</P>
<P>
   Participants, however, said Reno took the lead in criticizing
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby suggested that Reno had made several suggestions to the
committee and had agreed to work with it and its staff on possible
modifications.
</P>
<P>
   But, Shelby asserted, ''We're not interested in watering
anything down.''
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of classified material is ''a chronic problem,''
Shelby said. ''It hurts us with our allies.... It puts a lot of our
people, their lives, in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada, vice chairman of the panel and its
senior Democrat, said later in an interview that the committee ''is
legitimately concerned about leaks.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was optimistic that a common approach could be
reached that the administration could support. He said that Reno
seemed genuinely interested in working with the panel and with
Tenet and Freeh to ''tighten up the language used.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some concern that the language is overly broad,''
Bryan said. ''The last thing we want to do is get involved in a
First Amendment fight.''
</P>
<P>
   In advance of Wednesday's session, Justice Department spokesman
Myron Marlin said the department wanted ''to do all we can to
prevent leaks, but we don't support the legislation in its current
form.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're always willing to work with Congress to see if a
clarification of current or existing laws is needed,'' Marlin
added.
</P>
<P>
   The provision would give the Justice Department authority to
protect all classified information from unauthorized disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, prosecutors must show they leaked on behalf of a
foreign power or divulged ''national defense'' information..
</P>
<P>
   An unclassified report on the legislation by the intelligence
panel said the measure ''closes the gap in existing law.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine would be up to $10,000 and three years imprisonment
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment groups have opposed the bill, saying criminal
prosecutions are not necessarily the best way to stop leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Dalglish, executive director of the Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press, predicted the measure, if enacted, would
probably result in ''an increase in subpoenas against reporters''
as prosecutors sought to build cases against accused leakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would envision more journalists in jail for not identifying
sources than leakers being sentenced for something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Copenhaver, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who frequently
handles First Amendment cases, said, the legislation ''clearly
would have an adverse impact on the press and the media's ability
to get information. I can't believe that would pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three officials who met with the committee, Tenet has
generally been the most supportive of the concept.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA director ''has emphasized the seriousness of this
problem on numerous occasions and recognizes we must find more
effective ways to identify and punish individuals who leak
classified information,'' said an intelligence official who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said there are
existing laws and administrative remedies to deal with those who
divulge classified material.
</P>
<P>
   ''So we take it seriously. But the administration does not
support this legislation,'' Boucher added.
</P>
<P>
   The House version of the legislation, which passed in May, does
not contain such a provision. The Senate is expected to take up the
legislation later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Technology Sees Through Things  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thought only cartoon superheros could see
through walls to detect the villains?
</P>
<P>
   New technology called ultra-wideband will soon allow mere
mortals to detect objects buried underground and to build cars
enhanced with sensors that help avoid collisions.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-wideband uses millions of narrow pulses each second to get
an accurate reading of location and distance, opening the door for
new applications in radar tracking, precise positioning and
wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities vary from short-range computer networking for
homes to devices that determine the location of golfers on a
course.
</P>
<P>
   What regulators like even better is that ultra-wideband devices
can work within frequencies already allocated for other radio
services -- helping to maximize this dwindling resource.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission believes the technology is
so promising that the agency has proposed allowing it to be used on
an unlicensed basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of improvements in technology, it is now time to take
a look at making this service available to consumers, businesses
and public safety providers,'' said FCC Chairman William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a year or more before the FCC gives final clearance.
First, government agencies and private groups are testing to make
sure ultra-wideband can safely coexist with other services, like
the Global Positioning System, the U.S.-built network of satellites
for navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials want to put to rest any concerns about interference
and could require the technology to be used above very congested
frequencies, said John Reed, senior engineer in the FCC's technical
rules branch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the technology is being touted for its ability to harness
a small amount of power very efficiently. Ultra-wideband devices
can emit such little energy, that it could interfere no more ''than
your laptop does with your TV,'' said Ralph Petroff, chief
executive officer of Time Domain Corp., a Huntsville, Ala.-based
company. The company is one of a handful that has received special
government waivers to begin using the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Time Domain already has developed some ultra-wideband products
which allow law enforcement officials to detect motions through
surfaces such as walls. That means firefighters could determine
whether there are people inside a room before they knock down a
door.
</P>
<P>
   In Fairfax, Va., members of the local county rescue squad were
able to see people still breathing under 12 feet of rubble using
the devices after a building collapse, Petroff said.
</P>
<P>
   Newer versions to be introduced in the fall will provide even
clearer silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   Petroff says the chief benefit of ultra-wideband ''is the
ability to create entirely new products that don't yet exist and
entirely new industries.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a separate company has cropped up that intends to use
ultra-wideband specifically for the golf industry, so that club
owners can detect the location of golfers on a course and even see
how quickly players move through the holes.
</P>
<P>
   Zircon, a Silicon Valley company that also has a waiver to use
ultra-wideband, currently makes handheld tools that can detect
studs about an inch and a half behind a wall before consumers begin
drilling. But ultra-wideband could scan to greater depths, possibly
even providing a three-dimensional image of what's inside a slab of
concrete, said Chuck Heger, the company's vice president of
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential uses include:
</P>
<P>
   --A collision-avoidance sensor for cars so that when the vehicle
starts to brake, the radar can sense the speed of the deceleration.
The air bag could then be deployed to the appropriate level.
</P>
<P>
   --Networking high-speed Internet access, computer, cable or other
services throughout the home without wires.
</P>
<P>
   --Special radios that allow for covert secure communications
between soldiers without being identified.
</P>
<P>
   Reed even offered this ingenious application: a brewer could
determine how much beer is in a vat without measuring the foam --
something that most other tools don't allow.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Want Credit for Economy  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In their fight for the presidency, Al Gore and
George W. Bush are offering voters not only competing visions of
the future but also of the past. Call it the battle of Clintonomics
vs. Reaganomics.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is now on a three-week ''prosperity tour''
telling voters that the country's economic boom is due to the
Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We set our hands to a time of recession and doubt and built it
into a time of pride and plenty, the longest period of economic
growth in the entire American record,'' the vice president told a
cheering New York crowd on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hopes the expansion -- a record nine years and counting with
unemployment at a three-decade low -- will persuade voters to stick
with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush and his supporters note that the last recession hit
bottom and the expansion began in March 1991, nearly two years
before Bill Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
   That argument didn't help much in 1992, when a perception that
the economy's health was still precarious helped Clinton defeat
President Bush, the current candidate's father.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and his people contend that it is not Democratic
policies that are propelling today's prosperity, but those of
Ronald Reagan, who got Congress to enact a supply-side tax cut in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a miracle, but not a mystery,'' Bush tells his
audiences. ''The momentum of today's prosperity began in the 1980s
-- with sound money, deregulation, the opening of global trade and a
25 percent tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this tangle of claims that voters are being asked to sort
out. What government policies are responsible for the boom and
which candidate offers a way to keep the good times rolling?
</P>
<P>
   Voters' answers will be pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Gore's economic proposals are mostly a replay
of President Clinton's formula -- use the surpluses to reduce the
national debt, resist across-the-board tax cuts in favor of
cheaper, targeted tax relief for the middle class and spend big on
initiatives such as education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is taking a page out of Reagan's book, proposing the use of
$1.3 trillion in surpluses over the next decade to pay for an
across-the-board cut in income tax rates. He sees a hefty tax cut
as an insurance policy against an economic downturn and a way to
keep politicians from spending the surplus on wasteful government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked for Reagan in 1980, but that was a year when
the economic buzzword was ''stagflation,'' a horrible combination
of weak growth and high inflation.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the 1981 Reagan tax cut, coupled with the tight-money
policies of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, launched the
country into what they see as a 17-year stretch of prosperity,
interrupted only by a mild, eight-month recession in 1990-91 when
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Bush economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey, a scholar at the
conservative American Enterprise Institute, says that a ''sea
change'' in government economic policy occurred with Reagan's tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supporter Robert Shapiro, an economic policy-maker in the
Clinton administration, counters, ''No one can imagine that the
present expansion would have unfolded as it did without (Clinton's)
policy to turn large budget deficits into surpluses.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to referee, many private economists say it is difficult to
apportion credit in the complex, $10 trillion U.S. economy, made up
of individual decisions by millions of businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, for example, the nation is enjoying the fruits of a
boom in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Reagan's tax cuts, many economists are more likely to
give credit for the current prosperity to his decision to reappoint
Volcker, Jimmy Carter's choice as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   It was Volcker who pushed interest rates to levels not seen
since the Civil War in a successful effort to break a decade-long
bout of inflation. Reagan is also credited with picking Alan
Greenspan as Volcker's successor in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan gets credit for his deft handling of monetary policy
in the past 13 years. Former President Bush and Clinton win kudos
for sticking with him.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's job of combatting inflation with higher interest rates
or spurring a lagging economy with interest rate cuts is viewed by
the economics profession as the biggest policy card the government
can play to keep the economy on course. The use of government
spending and taxes is seen as too slow to have much impact.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to say that the president is simply a silent
partner to the Fed. Most economists see the president's role as
making sure the economic fundamentals are correct.
</P>
<P>
   For economists these days, that means keeping taxes as low as
possible to spur investment and business development, focusing on
deregulation to allow market forces to work and pursuing free trade
to foster global competition.
</P>
<P>
   In these areas, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton all win praise.
Carter started the push toward deregulation with the removal of
restrictions on the airlines. His successors followed by
deregulating trucking, savings and loans and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton receives credit from economists for his 1993 effort to
get control of the deficits. But economists note that much of his
program, including caps on domestic spending, was a continuation of
a 1990 budget agreement that George Bush supported even though it
meant breaking his ''no new taxes'' pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's efforts to rein in the soaring deficits were swamped by
the 1990-91 recession and the weak recovery that followed, which
drove the deficit to an all-time high. That allowed Clinton to win
the White House with a campaign focused on the economy under Bush.

<HEADLINE> Richardson's VP Chances in Question  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Democratic strategists and friends of
Bill Richardson worried Wednesday that the flak and finger pointing
over sky-high gas prices and lost nuclear secrets could doom -- or
at least darken -- the Energy secretary's prospects of becoming Al
Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans at a joint hearing of the Senate intelligence and
energy committees made clear that they would make a protracted
political issue of Richardson's accountability for the
disappearance of nuclear secrets from a vault at the Energy
Department's Los Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''The secretary stands naked on this issue,'' said Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy is hardly what presidential candidates look for in a
No. 2, especially Gore, already weighed down by the baggage of
campaign fund-raising allegations and President Clinton's scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore refused to discuss whether Richardson's troubles would
disqualify him. ''I am not speculating about anyone as a running
mate at this pont, and I have not compiled a list of potential
running mates, so I am just not going to engage in any kind of
speculation,'' he said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats contemplated the possibility of news headlines
stretching into the fall, linking Richardson's name with
investigations and hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are going to be ongoing investigations about this,
that's one thing. I don't think it should knock (Richardson) out of
the running but it's certainly not a positive,'' said Democratic
consultant David Doak, whose client list includes California Gov.
Gray Davis, also mentioned as a possible running mate for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Other Richardson loyalists, although confident of his resilience
to weather the storm, privately voiced concern that the noise would
make him a risk that Gore would just as soon not take.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials refused to comment. Gore's top-secret vetting
process is being conducted by former Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, who met with Richardson last month.
</P>
<P>
   Since allegations of spying at Los Alamos first surfaced early
last year, Richardson has given repeated assurances that security
had been tightened and America's nuclear secrets were safe. Two
computer hard drives were found missing from a Los Alamos vault on
May 7 -- a breach not disclosed until this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It isn't one of my best days,'' Richardson said with some
self-deprecation as he began remarks to an energy efficiency forum
at Washington's National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the Los Alamos headache the painful reminder that two
months ago, when the Energy Department revised its forecast and
declared prices would fall off after an early-April peak,
Richardson claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers have instead seen prices soar to well over $2 per
gallon, particularly in the Midwest, a critical battleground in the
presidential campaign. It's a bread-and-butter problem that not
only undercuts Richardson's credibility, but also the credibility
of Gore's argument that the economy is on track and he can keep it
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, despite public denials, has made no secret of his
interest in being picked to join the Democratic presidential
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The top Hispanic in Clinton's Cabinet, Richardson, 52, has
quietly courted favor with long-time friends of the vice president
and claimed an on-stage spot right behind Gore as he claimed
victory in the March 7 ''Super Tuesday'' primaries.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail and TV talk shows, Richardson has so
enthusiastically stumped for Gore that Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
chairman of the Intelligence Committee, griped Wednesday that the
mess at Los Alamos might not have happened if Richardson ''had been
doing his job as secretary ... and not out running for vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, a former congressman from New Mexico and United
Nations ambassador, has long been considered an obvious vice
presidential contender -- though by no means a top candidate --
because of his appeal within the Latino community. It's an emerging
constituency aggressively courted by both Gore and Republican rival
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson could also help Gore in New Mexico, one of a handful
of ''toss-up'' states in this election, although it isn't a large
prize, awarding only five Electoral College votes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Under Pressure Over War Crimes  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States tries to untangle
problems with the European Union and Sen. Jesse Helms as it starts
high-stakes negotiations to protect Americans from prosecution by
the world's first permanent war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador David Scheffer said Wednesday he believes the
United States can get other countries to agree to a new U.S.
proposal that would exempt U.S. soldiers and government officials
from prosecution -- and at the same time ensure that citizens of
''irresponsible nations'' are not exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the United States can achieve that remains to be seen:
Scheffer, the ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues, said his
deadline is June 30, when the commission preparing for the court's
operation ends a three-week meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union rejected the U.S. proposals circulated in
March to deal with the exemption issue, and a coalition of more
than 1,000 human rights and grass-roots groups has been lobbying
delegations not to accept any U.S. changes that would undermine the
court's effectiveness and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on the Clinton administration intensified Wednesday
when Helms, the North Carolina Republican who chairs the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, introduced legislation that would bar
any U.S. cooperation with the court, as long as the United States
has not ratified the treaty creating it.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was one of seven countries voting ''no'' when
120 countries approved the treaty to establish the International
Criminal Court in July 1998 in Rome. Nonetheless, it is helping
draft the court's rules of procedure and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The court was created to deal with the most heinous crimes --
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Under the treaty, the court will step in only when states are
unwilling or unable to dispense justice. It can exercise
jurisdiction when either the country where the crime took place or
the country whose nationals committed the crime have ratified the
statute.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty has been signed by 97 countries and ratified by 12,
most recently Venezuela and France, a NATO ally and a permanent
Security Council member. The grass-roots coalition predicts the
treaty will have the 60 ratifications needed to go into force by
the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The United States objects that American citizens can be subject
to the court's jurisdiction if an alleged crime is committed in a
country that ratified the treaty -- even if the United States is not
a party. Washington says this would leave U.S. troops and citizens
vulnerable to politically motivated prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Helms' legislation would require U.S. personnel to be
''immunized'' from the court's jurisdiction before the United
States participated in any U.N. peacekeeping operations. It also
would ban U.S. military assistance to any country that has ratified
the treaty, with a waiver for U.S. allies that agree to protect
Americans from extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Helms has vowed to block U.S. ratification of the treaty ''so
long as there is breath in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer said the administration was not consulted about the
Helms legislation, which he called ''counter-intuitive'' because
the government is negotiating for the protection of Americans that
Congress wants.
</P>
<P>
   ''That legislation is scare tactics,'' said Richard Dicker,
associate counsel of Human Rights Watch. ''It's not going to stop
the court. Its introduction is timed to try to intimidate
delegations here from standing on behalf of international justice.
It's very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union objected to the initial U.S. proposal on two
grounds: It could have given the permanent Security Council members
who did not ratify the treaty -- including the United States -- a
veto on prosecutions of their citizens, and it could have allowed
potential war criminals to escape prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer said the United States has dropped the Security Council
reference and is redrafting the proposal to ensure that
''irresponsible nations'' cannot take advantage of an exemption for
U.S. citizens from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we cannot have by June 30 is a rejection of the U.S.
efforts because there will be serious consequences if that is the
result,'' Scheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   What consequences?
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say that the U.S. government -- to at least a
significant degree -- would shut down on this treaty,'' he said.

Solomon Islands To Go Back To Police
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- Easing tensions in the strife-torn Solomon
Islands, rebels who seized the capital last week agreed on Thursday to let the
police regain control. The agreement came after Prime Minister Bartholomew
Ulufa'alu, held last week at gunpoint by the rebels, resigned Wednesday and
unveiled a plan to negotiate a permanent cease-fire between warring islanders.
Officials hope a deal will be reached within the next two weeks, paving the way
for parliament to select a new prime minister. The rebels would disarm only
after a comprehensive peace agreement had been reached and the issue of
compensation for land lost by Malaitans addressed, Nori told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio in Honiara on Thursday.

Lakers Beat Pacers 120-118, OT

young career to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 120-118 victory over the
Indiana Pacers and a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals. Superstars make great plays at
big moments, and that's what Bryant did three times in the extra session while
showing an uncanny calmness for a 21-year-old. Two of the shots were
straightaway jumpers to restore three-point leads; the last was a reverse layup
putback of a miss by Brian Shaw with 5.9 seconds left.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 120, Pacers 118, OT  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A star became a superstar, a kid became a
man.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant is legit, and he proved it on the NBA's biggest
stage.
</P>
<P>
   In a performance that validated all his hype, Bryant -- bum ankle
and all -- came to his team's rescue after Shaquille O'Neal fouled
out in overtime. Bryant made three of the most clutch shots of his
young career to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 120-118 victory
over the Indiana Pacers and a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the game you dream about as you're growing up,''
Bryant said. ''You lose yourself in the moment. You're consumed by
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   This was sweeter than any dream. This was reality, and Bryant
owned it by making great plays at big moments, especially in the
extra period, and showing an uncanny calmness for a 21-year-old --
all while playing on a ''throbbing'' ankle that had kept him out of
most of Game 2 and all of Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the shots were straightaway jumpers to restore
three-point leads; the last was a reverse layup putback of a miss
by Brian Shaw with 5.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kobe smelled it at the end of the game,'' coach Phil Jackson
said, ''and lifted us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers had a chance to win it after that, but Reggie Miller
-- after scoring 35 points -- couldn't get an open 3-pointer to drop
from the right elbow of the 3-point line. Robert Horry got the
slightest piece of the ball, and Miller had to change his
trajectory as Horry ran toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the stuff that has made Bryant a star -- the slam dunk
title, the numerous commercial endorsements, the girls who go
gah-gah in his presence -- the only thing missing was a heroic
basketball story to make it all matter.
</P>
<P>
   And this was the night for it to happen as Bryant had 28 points
in 47 minutes to give the Lakers the victory in what was easily the
best game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our mind this was the championship, so we came out with
effort,'' Bryant said. ''We wanted to keep it close and then make a
run.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd score, they'd come back and score, we'd score, they'd
score. You could get mad because our defense was lacking, but at
the same time it was fun. This is the type of thing you watch
growing up -- the ultimate, the NBA Finals,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal added 36 points and 21 rebounds, making 10 of 17 free
throws, and Horry scored 17 off the bench for Los Angeles, which
shot 52 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''We let one get away, so we came in with a conscious effort to
get this one, and we did,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller scored 19 of his points in the fourth quarter and
overtime, Rik Smits added 24 and Jalen Rose had 14 for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had a chance to win it in regulation but missed an 8-foot
jump hook at the buzzer after Travis Best had shot an airball on
Indiana's final possession of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It went into overtime tied 104-104, and the Lakers scored six of
the next eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Miller then hit a fallaway 3-pointer, O'Neal had a layup, and
O'Neal then went over Smits' back to pick up his sixth foul with
2:33 left.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson stood with his mouth agape, staring at referee Steve
Javie, who called the sixth foul, and the Pacers immediately got
the ball to Smits for a jump hook.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant calmly answered with a 23-footer to give the Lakers a
114-111 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just relaxed like I was playing in the back yard,'' Bryant
said.
</P>
<P>
   Smits rolled in another jump hook and again Bryant answered with
a long jumper. Miller made two from the line and Glen Rice tossed
up a short airball at the other end -- an airball that landed right
in the hands of Shaw for a chippy that made it 118-115.
</P>
<P>
   Smits made two from the line with 28.1 seconds left, and Bryant
rebounded Shaw's miss and converted it with 5.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was big-time tonight,'' Rice said ''That had to be the
biggest performance since I've been watching and playing with him,
of his career. He stepped up like a veteran. That just goes to show
how much he's matured.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers scored one more point on a foul shot after the Lakers
committed a foul before the ball was inbounded, but Miller's
last-gasp attempt hit the front of the rim and bounced over the
backboard as the final buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Pacers must try to become the first team ever to recover
from a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals. Game 5 is Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a little bit of pulse left in the heart,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Sam Perkins hit a 3-pointer to tie it
with 35 seconds left, and Horry threw a horrible entry pass to
Rice, missing him by five feet, to give the ball back to Indiana
with 17.4 seconds left. Jackson gazed angrily at Horry as he walked
back to the bench for a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers then ran a pick-and-roll and got Best isolated
one-on-one against O'Neal, and Best had a clear look at a fadeaway
from 14 feet. It hit nothing but air, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he was going to go by him,'' Horry said, ''but he
did what you should never try to do -- try to shoot over Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Lakers the ball back with 2.3 seconds left for the
last shot -- an 8-foot hook shot by O'Neal that was no good and sent
the game into overtime -- the first overtime in an NBA Finals since
Game 1 of the Chicago-Utah series in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Smits came out strong and hit his first four shots as Indiana
started 8-for-10. With Davis and Perkins providing excellent
defense on O'Neal, the Pacers steadily pulled ahead and took a
33-23 lead into the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal picked up his third foul with 4:58 left in the second
quarter, and Jackson took a risk by leaving him in. It paid off,
too, as O'Neal had two dunks and a short jumper to account for the
Lakers' next three baskets as they cut the deficit to three.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant picked up his fourth foul just one minute into the third
quarter, and again Jackson decided to take a risk and leave him in.
Again the move paid off as Bryant hit the Lakers' next three shots.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Rice gave Los Angeles its first lead of the
night, 62-60 with 7:59 left in the third, and Bryant drove around
Miller for a dunk that gave Los Angeles a 73-70 lead. The Lakers
stayed ahead for the rest of the quarter with Bryant scoring 10 in
the third, and carried an 80-77 lead into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins hit a 3-pointer to give Indiana an 89-84 lead with 7:44
left, and O'Neal picked up his fifth foul with 7:32 left.
</P>
<P>
   There were five lead changes and one tie over the next four
minutes as the Lakers repeatedly went to O'Neal and Bryant while
the Pacers looked to Miller and Best for offense.
</P>
<P>
   Miller made his fifth straight shot of the fourth quarter, a
3-pointer with 3:17 left for a 101-99 lead, but that would be
Indiana's last basket until Perkins' 3 with 35 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
Notes: After making 25 straight free throws in this series, Miller
finally missed one late in the second quarter. ... The Pacers have
been complaining that O'Neal routinely commits 3-second violations,
criticism which Jackson called ''typical Indiana stuff.'' Are the
Pacers whiners, coach Larry Bird was asked? ''Well, sometimes.
Yeah, we like to whine. But we like to win, also,'' Bird said. The
first whistle of the game was for a 3-second violation on O'Neal.

<HEADLINE> S. Koreans Elated at Summit Accord  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The inter-Korean summit turned out
better than many had imagined, ending in clasped hands, champagne
toasts and a historic accord to work toward eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Once the euphoria fades, however, the lengthy, tortuous peace
process begins.
</P>
<P>
   The deal signed in Pyongyang by South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was the biggest step
toward reconciliation since the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in
an uneasy armistice.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, South Korean officials said the two leaders
confirmed that their countries have no intention of invading each
other and would not make any threatening moves. The North launched
the Korean War by invading the South, which for years feared
another invasion. The North, in turn, accused the U.S.-backed South
of plotting its downfall.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials who had studiously tried to downplay
summit expectations, saying they would be happy with only a photo
opportunity, prepared to return home in triumph. Kim Dae-jung
lunched with Kim Jong Il on Thursday before his departure for Seoul
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day summit was steeped in symbolism, a critical
quality because leaders of the two countries had not met since the
peninsula was divided at the end of World War II. Although the text
of Wednesday's agreement did not mention several key disputes, many
South Koreans were elated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't expect to see such a result so soon. I watched
television the whole time. There was nothing I could do to
contribute, but I am happy,'' said Kim Woon-soon, 65, a housewife
who came to pray at a Buddhist temple in downtown Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   The North's media, normally given to diatribes against South
Korea, Japan and the United States, was also upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   The summit ''marked an important occasion of opening a bright
prospect of removing distrust and confrontation between the North
and the South,'' said KCNA, Pyongyang's foreign news outlet. It
said North Korean papers printed news of the accord on their front
pages with photos of the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement provided for reunions this summer of families that
have been separated for 50 years by the closed and heavily
fortified border, a summit meeting in Seoul and the promotion of
South Korean investment that the North's failing economy
desperately needs.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea also agreed to repatriate an unspecified number of
convicted North Korean spies who have completed their jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   The accord did not deal with two major strategic concerns: the
North's demand that the United States withdraw its 37,000 troops
from South Korea, and the North's nuclear and long-range missile
programs that led Washington to label it a dangerous ''rogue''
state.
</P>
<P>
   Han Jai-bong, a political theory professor at Yonsei University
in the South Korean capital, warned that the military standoff on
the Korean peninsula will remain for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we're quite in the mood to think about this
rationally,'' Han said. ''Korean intellectuals are being very quiet
and don't want to rain on the parade.''
</P>
<P>
   The United State wants to develop a missile defense system to
deal with the threat from countries like North Korea, a proposal
Russia has warned could lead to a new nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's deliberations on whether to deploy
a national missile defense will not be influenced by rapprochement
on the Korean peninsula, the State Department said. Washington
considers other states such as Iraq and Iran, as well as
terrorists, to be threats that justify such a system.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Wednesday, North Korea's ceremonial head of state,
Kim Yong Nam, questioned the South Korean president about another
source of conflict: the South's National Security Law, which
outlaws pro-communist activities. Kim Dae-jung said the South
Korean parliament was considering changes to the law, which human
rights activists say has been used to harass government opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Reunification itself is an enormous task that some observers say
could take decades. Impoverished North Korea, which has long feared
the rich South might try to absorb it in any unification scheme,
has advocated a confederacy of the two states.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul's ambassador in Washington, Lee Hong-koo, said South Korea
has advocated a similar alliance of ''two systems under one roof''
as a step toward reunification. However, the totalitarian North and
the democratic South would have to reconcile their opposing
political systems.
</P>
<P>
   The summit agreement is more detailed than similar ones reached
by lower-ranking officials in 1972 and 1991. Those deals, which
also called for reconciliation and reunification, quickly gave way
to renewed hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   South Koreans were surprised by the warmth and spontaneity
displayed by Kim Jong Il, who rules by decree and who has been
widely condemned for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Some South Koreans focused on the great costs they are likely to
incur if they end up providing large amounts of economic aid to the
North. The financial burden on West Germany when it unified with
East Germany a decade ago is often scrutinized in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess the issue is now how much tax money we should pay. But
it's OK. It's worth it,'' said 44-year-old storeowner Kwon
Seung-ryong. ''Both Kims deserve a Nobel peace prize.''

<HEADLINE> German Leader Reaches Nuclear Deal  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and the bosses of
Germany's nuclear power plants agreed Thursday on a plan to end the
country's use of atomic energy, clinching a deal that has eluded
Schroeder's center-left government for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   At an early morning news conference, Schroeder announced that
both sides had compromised on how quickly the phaseout would take
effect, with the government allowing two extra years of running
time. That means Germany's last nuclear plant would go off-line in
about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders said they regretted the early closures. ''But
we accept the primacy of the political system,'' Ulrich Hartmann,
chairman of the Veba utility, said after 4{ hours of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder came into office in late 1998 promising to negotiate
an end to nuclear power in Germany -- an issue especially dear to
the hearts of his junior coalition partner, the environmentalist
Greens party.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's 19 nuclear plants provide almost a third of the
country's electricity. But the country also has a big anti-nuclear
lobby that regularly targets shipments of nuclear fuel or waste
with massive, sometimes violent protests.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, a Social Democrat, initially said his government
would legislate plant closures after a year if a voluntary deal
couldn't be reached with plant operators. But the negotiations
dragged on over 18 months and were marked by bickering between the
partners over how quickly the plants should be forced off-line.
</P>
<P>
   The final deal allows a total lifespan of 32 years for power
plants, Schroeder said. He did not say exactly when the last
nuclear energy production will end. But the newest German plants
came on line in the late 1980s, which means their 32 years should
be up around 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday's deal was reached, Greens party lawmakers had
suggested that the first two nuclear plants could be shut down
before the end of the current legislative period in 2002. The
conservative opposition, however, has threatened to block any deal
in the upper house of parliament, where the states are represented.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives accuse the government of ignoring potential job
losses and costs to states like Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg --
both conservative-led -- that are major shareholders in public
utilities. They also argue that scrapping nuclear power would
create other problems by forcing Germany to use other fuels to
produce electricity, keeping the nation from meeting targets for
reducing air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has said he believes a nuclear phaseout law could be
formulated that does not require approval in the upper house.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bavarian state government said Wednesday it was already
preparing a complaint to bring to the Constitutional Court if
Schroeder tries to push through a deal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops To Remain in S. Korea  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Relations may be thawing between the Cold War
enemies on the divided Korean peninsula, but that doesn't mean U.S.
troops there will be withdrawn any time soon, says South Korean
Ambassador Lee Hong-koo.
</P>
<P>
   A top priority of Communist North Korea for years has been to
seek withdrawal of 37,000 American soldiers posted across the
demilitarized zone in defense of rival South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee says North Korea knew not to bother to bring it up this
week, when the two nations held a historic presidential summit to
work for improved relations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview whether the summit will lead to a U.S.
troop withdrawal, Lee said: ''That's a long way off.''
</P>
<P>
   A former South Korean prime minister and unification minister,
Lee said the North Koreans were told many times before the summit
that if they bring up the troop issue first, ''it won't go
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, he said, ''we are not prepared to discuss
this issue. The North Koreans understood this. So we don't expect
any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee spoke hours after North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and South
Korean President Kim Dae-Jung signed an agreement in Pyongyang
pledging to work for reconciliation and eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said ''it's probably premature to leap to any
conclusions'' about cutting U.S. troop levels on the Korean
peninsula based solely on the Pyongyang summit.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, the Army's top general, commented in response to a
reporter's question after a Korean War 50th anniversary ceremony at
Arlington National Cemetery. He did not rule out future troop
reductions in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that at this point we should wait and see what
actually comes officially out of the talks today,'' he said.
''There's been no mention to my knowledge made on either side of
any troop reductions.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States announced in September that it was easing
sanctions against North Korea that have been in place for 50 years.
National security officials have said the procedures for carrying
out that decision would be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
   The end of these sanctions would allow North Korea to export raw
materials and goods to the United States and would open air and
shipping routes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The summit is unlikely to affect U.S. plans for a missile
defense system, according to the State Department. North Korea's
missile program has been cited as a major justification for
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we see in (the summit) the seeds of anything
that would change the possibility of a missile threat to the United
States that we would have to deal with,'' said spokesman Richard
Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the whole world should be encouraged by
the summit but added that there is no way to know if the divided
peninsula will be united.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got a lot of work to do and it's just the first
step,'' Clinton said. ''But it's clearly a move in the right
direction and everyone else in the world should be encouraged by
this. This is a good thing.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Daryl Johnston To Retire  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Emmitt Smith has so many great memories of
running behind Daryl Johnston that he can't pick a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he'll use the last one to illustrate the bond they
shared.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played Washington and I had a fumble on our goal line,''
Smith said. ''He made the block, yet he recovered the fumble. That
was the knack he had for feeling where I was and being in the right
place at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's fourth-quarter fumble recovery helped the Dallas
Cowboys keep alive the biggest comeback in franchise history. A few
days later, the fullback went on injured reserve with his second
serious neck injury in three years, effectively ending his career.
</P>
<P>
   He made it official Wednesday with a news conference at Texas
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't be sad, you can't be disappointed, because this
career has exceeded any of the expectations I could've had growing
up in a small town,'' said Johnston, whose long goodbye last season
helped him remain composed as he reminisced on his career and his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from notes that he pinned to a table, Johnston thanked
his coaches and teammates from Pop Warner to the Cowboys, and many
of the other people who impacted his life.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his highest compliments were for the two guys he gave up
his body for the most, Smith and Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston called Aikman ''one of the most incredible competitors
I've ever had an opportunity to be with'' and credited the
quarterback for his own involvement in charity work.
</P>
<P>
   As for Smith, Johnston said it was his privilege to spring open
the holes that helped him become the No. 3 rusher in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never regretted my role here,'' Johnston said. ''I always
wanted to do everything I possibly could for you, and that goes to
you as being a great person.''
</P>
<P>
   In describing his own career, Johnston cited a line from his
former position coach, Joe Brodsky: ''I fully utilized the limited
skills I had as a running back.''
</P>
<P>
   He jokingly blamed his career-ending injury on special teams
coach Joe Avezzano.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you for leaving me on kickoff returns for eight years,''
Johnston said. ''I really feel that I might be out there this year
if I'd only played four years on kickoff returns, but we won't get
into that now.
</P>
<P>
   ''It actually got to the point where when my doctor said I was
cleared to play football in 1997, I asked if there was any way he
could write a note to my special teams coach and tell him it would
be in my best interest to get off kickoff returns. That is the only
way I was able to get off those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   What truly set Johnston apart was how adored he was while
playing a usually thankless position.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL recognized him by changing its rules to create a spot
for him at the Pro Bowl. Fans showed their appreciation by
screaming his nickname -- and it didn't only happen in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was obvious to see why we were known as America's Team when
you can go into RFK and Veteran's Stadium and some of the other
hostile areas around the country and still hear the fans give you
the Moose call,'' he said. ''It always brought a smile to my face.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's next job likely will be in broadcasting. He worked
three NFL Europe games this summer, and he's auditioned with CBS
and ESPN.

<HEADLINE> Top Military Man Alleged To Be Spy  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- As his wife waited in a car outside, George
Trofimoff stepped inside a Tampa hotel for a meeting. The retired
Army Reserve colonel with an address on Patriot Drive emerged in
handcuffs, accused of spying for the Soviet Union and Russia for a
quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   The 73-year-old Trofimoff on Wednesday became the highest
ranking U.S. military officer ever charged with espionage, U.S.
Attorney Donna Bucella said. Trofimoff allegedly photographed U.S.
documents and passed the film to a boyhood friend who recruited him
into the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested after an FBI agent posing as a Soviet agent
lured him to the hotel with the promise of a past due payment for
spy services.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff was under investigation by German and American
officials for seven years and the charges against him could bring a
life sentence in prison. Authorities said his wife, Jutta, was not
involved.
</P>
<P>
   According to a federal indictment, Trofimoff sold ''documents,
photographs, photographic negatives and information relating to the
national defense of the United States'' while serving as a civilian
employee of the U.S. Army at the Nuremburg Joint Interrogation
Center in West Germany from 1969 to 1994. The center is where
refugees and defectors from the Soviet bloc were questioned.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Special Agent Frank Gallagher said it isn't clear what
damage Trofimoff's alleged spying might have caused. At a hearing
Wednesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Pizzo ordered Trofimoff held
without bail and gave him a court-appointed attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff retired from his Army civilian job in 1995 after 35
years. He has been living in a gated community in Melbourne, Fla.,
and works as a part-time bagger at a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff's telephone number was unlisted.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a very good neighbor and a good friend,'' said one
resident, John Callaway. ''These people are wonderful people. What
happened, that's way in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Germany to Russian parents, Trofimoff became a U.S.
citizen in 1951. He joined the Army in 1953, served for three years
and in 1959 was hired as a civilian working in military
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher said Trofimoff was paid about $250,000 during his
25-year spying career, but wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was coming to Tampa to be paid for services he supplied in
the past, money he thought was owed to him in the past,'' Gallagher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Trofimoff used his unlimited access to
classified information at the interrogation center to tell the KGB
what the United States knew about the Soviets and their allies.
Trofimoff also knew of weaknesses in American
intelligence-gathering and passed that information on to the KGB,
the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff also received the Order of the Red Banner, the Soviet
award presented to bravery and self-sacrifice in the defense of the
socialist homeland, prosecutors said. The Soviet Union broke apart
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said Trofimoff was recruited into the KGB by Igor
Vladimirovich Susemihl, his old friend and a Russian Orthodox
priest who served as the Archbishop of Vienna and Austria and
temporary Archbishop of Baden and Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff allegedly took documents from the his work and
photographed them, passing the film on to Susemihl and other KGB
officers during meetings in Austria. The indictment also notes
eight meetings between Trofimoff and KGB officers, naming the KGB
agents in three instances.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff and Susemihl were arrested in Germany in 1994 on
espionage charges, but were released when German officials could
not prove their case within the five-year statute of limitations.
Trofimoff told German authorities the money he received from
Susemihl, who died in 1999, were personal loans.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Looks To Clinton For Lift  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is looking
for a lift from President Clinton as he presses for an immediate
Israeli pullback on the West Bank and, ultimately, a state with its
capital in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton already has endorsed what he called Palestinian
''aspirations,'' but with a mid-September deadline for an accord
just over the horizon, Arafat would like to bank on concrete U.S.
help to achieve his goals.
</P>
<P>
   American mediator Dennis B. Ross joined negotiations here
Wednesday and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright invited Arafat
to her home in Georgetown for lunch Thursday after his White House
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians briefly halted the negotiations on Wednesday in
a dispute over a promised Israeli pullback on the West Bank and
Israel's refusal to release more than a few Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement is Clinton's highest foreign policy priority in the
little more than seven months he has remaining in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talked to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on the
telephone for 40 minutes Wednesday and said the two sides were not
ready for a Camp David-style three-way meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we need to get the parties a little closer before we
can go there,'' Clinton told reporters. ''We don't have a lot of
time. We're down to all the hard issues now, and we're working on
it. I'm hopeful, but I don't want to hold out false hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Israel had agreed to
release only three of 250 prisoners whose freedom was sought and
was trying to delay the pullback due later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not allow its delay for even one minute,'' Erekat told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The pullback, which Israel had promised, would not involve any
Palestinian gestures in response. But if it were part of
negotiations for an overall settlement it could provide Israel with
a useful bargaining chip.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian negotiator said the offer to release three
prisoners had been rejected. ''We don't want goodwill gestures from
the Israelis. All we want from Israel is to implement the
agreements. They can keep their goodwill gestures for themselves,''
Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said there was
no halt to the negotiations overall, but some of the talks, which
are spread between two U.S. air force bases, may have been
interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to have Ross join the talks indicated the
administration was preparing to apply some heat in its quest for a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees, water problems and the promised Israeli pullback this
month on the West Bank also were on the agenda for the talks at
Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland and at Bolling Air
Force Base in southeast Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, said ''the
only way to bridge the gaps is through talking'' and that any other
approach would not help solve problems.
</P>
<P>
   Before the flap surfaced, the negotiators were considering an
extension of their slow-moving talks on the future of Jerusalem and
Palestine's aspirations for a state.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the talks had said the negotiators may remain
through the weekend to continue their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The American hosts described the first round of talks in more
than two weeks as intensive, but did not say whether there had been
progress toward a land-for-peace settlement that would be bound to
include approval of a Palestinian state on the West Bank and in
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians want part of Jerusalem, as well, for their
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian officials, at U.S. direction, declined
to characterize the discussions.

<HEADLINE> United, US Airways Merger Mulled  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Days of Capitol Hill hearings on the proposed
marriage of United Airlines and US Airways have yielded few
defenders of the largest airline merger ever.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan skeptism from politicians, as well as outside
analysts, consumer groups, local officials and other airlines,
leaves the chiefs of the two airlines in a lonely spot arguing
their deal would be good for travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If US Airways is swallowed by United, I worry that
constituents will face few choices, wretched service and a pricing
structure that would make a mafia Don blush,'' Rep. Louis
Slaughter, D-N.Y., told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, also speaking at the Senate Judiciary Committee's
antitrust panel Wednesday, worried aloud that the merger would mean
rising airfares, lost airline employee jobs and suffering
communities. The possibility that the deal would spark others in
the industry only worsened those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Already, since the $4.3 billion deal was announced last month,
there have been news reports of merger talks between Northwest
Airlines and American Airlines. Industry analysts have also
suggested that Delta would fit well with Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses complained to the House panel that increasing
concentration of airline hubs has already driven up costs for
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Business Travel Association surveyed corporate
travel managers last week and found that 82 percent believe
industry consolidation would lead to even higher fares, less choice
and poorer service.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prospect of further concentrating market share in the
hands of a small but elite group of corporate giants represents the
worst possible scenario for commercial avation and for the American
consumer,'' said Mike Gordon, the mayor of El Segundo, Calif.,
which borders Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The deal faces for more scrutiny Thursday at the House
Transportation Committee's second hearing this week on the subject.
Still more are to follow next week.
</P>
<P>
   Congress does not have authority to approve or reject the
proposed merger, but the issues raised by lawmakers likely will be
considered by the Justice and Transportation departments, which
will rule on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on what I've heard so far, the competitive implications
of this merger are troubling and I believe it deserves rigorous
scrutiny, '' said House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Wednesday, Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, the chairman of
the Senate antitrust subcommittee, and Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin,
the subcommittee's senior Democrat, urged Joel Klein, head of the
Justice Department's antitrust division, ''to examine this deal
with appropriate care and scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the Senate committee, the two airlines' chief
executives -- along with Robert Johnson, the Black Entertainment
Television head who wants to launch a new Washington-based airline
as part of the deal -- promised it won't stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   James Goodwin, the chairman and chief executive of Elk Grove
Village, Ill.-based UAL Corp., United's parent, said the deal would
create ''the first truly efficient nationwide network that will
provide consumers with unparalleled travel convenience and
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also raised questions about the proposed launch of DC
Air, Johnson's planned airline. It would rely on United and US
Airways for some of its equipment and employees and would lease
jets -- an expense which critics say could make it tough for DC Air
to be a low-cost airline.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson assured the Senate panel his airline would provide
''safe, reliable, high-quality service at competitive prices'' and
would be ''a viable and totally independent competitor from day
one.''

<HEADLINE> Report Details House Investments  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey is second
in command among House Republicans, but he ranks at the bottom when
measuring personal wealth. Other House leaders are better off but
hardly wealthy, financial disclosure reports for 1999 showed today.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, R-Texas, a former college professor, has no assets beyond
a checking account and only supplements his salary with a $2,400
annual teacher's pension.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as congressional disclosures show each year,
poverty in Congress is relative. Armey's House salary last year of
$151,800 would look like a large sum to millions of Americans and
was higher than the rank-and-file House lawmakers' pay of $136,700.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., owned far greater assets than
other House leaders, but also had significant liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   He valued a 270-acre farm in Shipman, Ill., a townhouse in
Washington and a Plainfield, Ill. building each at $100,000 to
$250,000. But he still owed between $50,000 and $100,000 on each of
those properties.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., was somewhat better
off than Armey. He listed a mutual fund worth $15,000 to $50,000
and four other funds valued between $1,000 and $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   But he also carried major liabilities last year compared to
those assets, including two student loans for his children. He owed
between $50,000 and $100,000 on one student loan, $15,000 to
$50,000 on a second and also borrowed between $15,000 and $50,000
on his life insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   The financial reports express assets and liabilities in broad
ranges because they are designed to disclose a lawmaker's holdings
rather than net worth.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Whip Tom DeLay, of Texas, had investments worth
less than Gephardt's but he did not list any liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay valued his Exxon stock between $50,000 and $100,000, had a
bank account worth between $1,000 and $15,000 and kept less than
$1,000 in the House credit union.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Herbert Bateman, R-Va., listed his parking space in
Arlington, Va., as an asset. He valued it between $1,000 and
$15,000 and reported earnings from renting it between $200 and
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Floyd
Spence, R-S.C., listed much more valuable real estate: seven
buildings and 39.4 acres of land, all in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   The land in Lexington, S.C. was valued at $1 million to $5
million and three of the buildings were worth between $500,000 and
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The retiring chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, attached a detailed financial statement
to his disclosure report.
</P>
<P>
   He listed assets valued Dec. 31 at $3.3 million and no
liabilities. His stock holdings that date included 800 Microsoft
shares valued at $93,600 and holdings in computer chip maker Intel
that was worth $116,200. Municipal bond holdings were worth
$322,329.
</P>
<P>
   Archer reported he owned a 1987 Dodge truck worth $2,000, a 1988
Mercedes valued at $24,000, a 1998 Jeep Cherokee listed at $20,000
and a tractor worth $17,000. He valued his coin collection at its
cost: $16,326.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Battles Over Land Programs  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are pushing a $14.6 billion
measure that finances federal land and cultural programs toward
House approval -- and a potential election-year veto battle with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders were hoping to complete the fiscal 2001
legislation on Thursday as part of their rush to finish Congress'
13 annual spending bills early to give lawmakers more time for
their re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But though the measure would boost spending over this year's
levels for national parks operations and national wildlife refuges,
it slices some Clinton intiatives.
</P>
<P>
   That includes giving Clinton just $186 million of the $620
million he wants for his ''lands legacy'' program for acquiring
federal, state and local land for parks. The bill would also forbid
the government from managing any of the eight national monuments he
has designated this year, which comprise more than 1 million acres
in five Western states, and cut his requests for clean water and
energy efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   It would also give the National Endowment for the Arts $98
million in 2001, about the same as this year but $52 million less
than Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill fails to address the critical needs of the American
people,'' White House officials wrote to congressional leaders
recently in a policy statement that threatened a Clinton veto.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, a subcommittee of the House Appropriations
Committee planned to vote on a roughly $13.3 billion foreign aid
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee Chairman Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., has already said
he will propose abandoning the usual process of giving Israel its
$2.8 billion in aid in the first month of the new fiscal year,
which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is aimed at protesting Israel's planned sale of the
PHALCON early warning radar system to China, a system that costs
$250 million.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers debated the Interior bill on Wednesday, they voted
214-211 to cut $126.5 million, or about half the budget, from a
program that provides federal subsidies for auto makers and others
who perform research on more efficient car engines.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was a defeat for Clinton, who started the program early
in his administration, and for Vice President Al Gore, a strong
supporter of the initiative and the likely Democratic presidential
nominee. Two-thirds of Republicans and more than one-third of
Democrats voted to cut the program.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration, the auto industry and Michigan
lawmakers lobbied to defend the program, they were opposed by a
coalition of fiscal conservatives and environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the program said it would improve the country's
energy efficiency, strengthen its economy, help consumers and lead
to a cleaner environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ironic that so many House members who complain about high
gasoline prices have cut the heart out of a program designed to
save American motorists millions of dollars in energy costs in the
future,'' said White House spokesman Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents called it corporate welfare for the auto companies,
and said it focused too much on finding cleaner diesel engines,
which they said would still be dirty. Opponents ranged from
consumer advocate Ralph Nader to the pro-environment Sierra Club to
the conservative Citizens Against Government Waste.
</P>
<P>
   ''There shouldn't be corporate welfare subsidies to an industry
that's very profitable,'' said Rep. John Sununu, R-N.H., who
sponsored the amendment with Rep. Robert Andrews, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the House by 217-214 approved the $339.5 billion
measure financing the Departments of Labor, Education, and Health
and Human Services. That bill, the biggest and most controversial
of the spending measures, faces a Clinton veto threat because it
would provide less than he wants for some education and other
social programs.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee also used a voice vote to
approve a $35.5 billion measure for the Commerce, Justice and State
departments.
</P>
<P>
   It, too, faces a veto threat because it ignores Clinton's
request for $150 million to hire 1,000 local prosecutors to handle
gun-related crimes. The measure also cuts his proposals for legal
aid for the poor and for U.S. contributions for U.N. peacekeeping
missions, and would limit the money available to the Justice
Department to pursue the federal lawsuit against the tobacco
industry.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Probe Said Sensitive  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With nuclear scientists at the Los Alamos
weapons lab in New Mexico taking polygraph tests, the investigation
into the loss of computer files containing nuclear weapons secrets
is ''at a very sensitive stage,'' an Energy Department official
says.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who were briefed on the security lapse Wednesday said
the investigation became more difficult because senior officials
were not told for three weeks of the loss of two computer hard
drives that held the materials. Further, there was no system in
place requiring tracking of the missing devices when they were
being used.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have the answers we need on this issue,'' President
Clinton remarked to reporters when asked by the latest security
controversy hitting the Energy Department. ''It's a serious matter,
and I don't think any of us need to be characterizing anything
until we know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Energy Department security and counterespionage experts
told separate House and Senate hearings that 26 people -- members of
a nuclear emergency response team at Los Alamos -- had access to the
highly secure vault in which the two computer hard drives were
kept.
</P>
<P>
   But no system was in place that required individuals to sign out
the devices, or even to track the use of the missing hard drives
which were part of a ''kit'' to be used to dismantle a nuclear
warhead in an emergency or terrorist act, lawmakers were told.
</P>
<P>
   ''That sounds like a real bonehead security procedure to me,''
Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said during a Senate hearing at which
senior DOE security officials and the director of the Los Alamos
lab testified.
</P>
<P>
   John Browne, the lab director, said the missing computer drives
were classified as ''secret'' -- not top secret -- and therefore were
not required under an easing of security standards in the early
1990s to be signed out when used or tracked. He said lab officials
at the time opposed the change.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have declined publicly to go into details as to what
the drives contained or how their loss might affect national
security. Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said
the disks had an array of technical data used to help dismantle
U.S. and other countries' nuclear warheads should the need arise in
an accident or terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA is conducting a ''damage assessment'' in the event the
two hard drives, which contain identical information, are not
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our focus is to find out what happened to these disks,'' said
Edward Curran, the Energy Department's counterintelligence
director. ''If it had been reported sooner, we'd be an a lot better
position.'' Curren said the investigation was now at ''a very
sensitive stage.'' He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which has assumed control of what is now a criminal
investigation, began polygraph tests of some Los Alamos scientists
on Wednesday. The focus has been on the 26 members of an emergency
nuclear response team, known as the NEST team.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said a member of the team told investigators he recalled
seeing the two drives in the vault on April 7 and another team
member said he examined the containers on April 27 and would
remember if the drives had been missing.
</P>
<P>
   On May 7, team members again went into the vault because they
wanted to safeguard the emergency response kits from possibly being
destroyed by a wildfire that was threatening to engulf the lab.
They found the two drives missing from one of the kits, but did not
report the finding to superiors.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the laboratory was evacuated. NEST team members
began searching for the drives on May 24 when normal operations
resumed at the lab, but still told no one, said Browne, who added
he did not become aware of any problems until May 31. He notified
the Energy Department the next day.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Wednesday, Browne disclosed that ''several'' of
the six Los Alamos managers, who were suspended with pay pending
further investigations, had in fact known of the vanishing hard
drives as early as May 7. None of the senior officials in the chain
of command were aware of the security breach, however, said Browne.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who is facing sharp criticism
from congressional Republicans -- and some Democrats -- for the
latest security flap, said he was angry about what appears to be
clear violations of security and at the failure to report the
incident promptly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want accountability. There is going to be disciplinary
action,'' Richardson told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii OK's Marijuana For Medicine  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DiPIETRO
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii has become the first state to use
legislation to approve the possession and use of marijuana for
medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   While signing the bill into law on Wednesday, Gov. Ben Cayetano
said it was one aspect of his effort to make Hawaii the health-care
center of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad to see this bill before me,'' he said. ''My own
feeling is more states are going to come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii is the eighth state to decriminalize the use of medical
marijuana, but the previous seven states did so through ballot
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hawaii's law, patients with certain qualifying illnesses
must obtain a doctor's recommendation to use medical marijuana and
must register with the state Department of Public Safety to avoid
criminal prosecution under state law.
</P>
<P>
   The department first must formulate and implement rules to
govern the registration process, a process that Donald Topping of
the advocacy group Drug Policy Forum estimated could take up to two
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will allow patients who have been using marijuana to do so
without fear or prosecution,'' Topping said. ''There are a number
of people who would like to use it but have hesitated because of
the illegality of it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are between 500 and 1,000 people in Hawaii who will be
eligible to use medical marijuana, although the exact number is
hard to discern because some people keep quiet about their use,
Topping said.
</P>
<P>
   Topping and others agreed with Cayetano's prediction that the
Hawaii law will lead to similar legislation in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may set an example for other states, give them the
courage to proceed,'' Topping said. ''I think the fear of being
soft on drugs is beginning to fade now with this kind of
legislation being passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see other states following suit in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   People who are stopped by police and found to be possessing
marijuana will have to prove they are exempt from the state's
criminal laws governing marijuana. Those laws remain in effect for
all citizens not registered with the department.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dennis Shields of the Religion of Jesus Church, which
uses marijuana as a sacrament, said his effort to win passage of a
medical marijuana law resulted from the death of his son, Ryan,
from cancer in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he would be happy,'' said Shields. ''For him right
now, going through his struggle, he would have the opportunity not
to feel the guilt some people put on him.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're throwing up uncontrollably, with 100 stitches in
your gut that are fresh, you don't care about getting high, you
care about stopping throwing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Alaska, Washington, California, Arizona, Nevada,
Oregon, Maine and the District of Columbia have approved medical
marijuana laws. The Justice Department is challenging those laws.

<HEADLINE> AMA To Vote on Reproductive Measure  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A resolution that asks the American Medical
Association to support action ensuring certain reproductive
services when religious hospitals merge with or acquire other
hospitals has been amended amid opposition from the Catholic
church.
</P>
<P>
   The original measure wanted the AMA to support efforts to force
Catholic hospitals to provide reproductive services such as
sterilization.
</P>
<P>
   The softened version asks the nation's largest doctors group to
''support action to ensure continued patient access to pregnancy
prevention services'' including tubal ligation and vasectomy at
such hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The new measure was drafted at the AMA's annual meeting this
week. Dr. Delmar Tonge, a gynecologist and chairman of the AMA's
California delegation, said he would submit it Thursday when the
AMA's policy-making House of Delegates scheduled a vote on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to force anybody to do anything,'' Tonge said.
However, he said patients ''should not be denied care or access to
care just because of an acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution said the AMA should support existing law
requiring health plans to provide access to reproductive services
when they are a covered benefit. But it also said the AMA should
affirm its policy that doctors should not be required to perform
any act that violates their moral principles.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders said the original resolution would have changed
that policy, forcing doctors at certain hospitals to perform
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The California delegation amended the measure after strong
criticism earlier this week from Cardinal Francis George, head of
the Chicago archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose because Catholic health care networks are
aggressively acquiring non-Catholic hospitals in California and
elsewhere. In some rural areas that means a Catholic hospital
becomes the only choice for health care.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wednesday at the convention, the group:
</P>
<P>
   --Agreed to urge the government to step up regulation of
anti-bacterial soaps, lotions and other household products.
</P>
<P>
   --Rejected a resolution seeking a moratorium on gene patenting,
referring it to the AMA board of trustees for review.
</P>
<P>
   --Agreed to support the prescription of syringes for addicted
patients, in conjunction with addiction counseling, to help prevent
the transmission of blood-borne diseases such as AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   --Agreed to notify the Consumer Product Safety Commission about
the potential risk of eye injury from bungee cords. Doctors
testified about patients being blinded when the cords unexpectedly
recoiled.

<HEADLINE> Handel Society Names New Director  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Starting next season, a Welsh conductor known for
performing modern music will hold aloft the baton of the storied
Handel &AMP; Haydn Society.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston-based society Wednesday named 39-year-old Grant
Llewellyn as artistic director. The society, known casually to
admirers as the H &AMP; H Society, bills itself as the oldest
continuously performing musical society in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more and more like a homecoming. Boston appears to be
part of my destiny,'' said Llewellyn, who was the assistant
director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1990 to 1993. ''I've
probably been wined and dined by every member of the board at least
twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Llewellyn, a cellist and pianist, most recently has been the
conductor-in-residence of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. He
will replace conductor Christopher Hogwood, 58, on July 1, 2001,
when Hogwood leaves the society after almost 15 years at the
podium.

<HEADLINE> Many Senators Ride Tech Stock Wave  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The wealth of senators is riding the tech
stock roller coaster, invested in more traditional stocks, bonds
and real estate, or tucked away in safe and simple bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   At least one senator, Jeff Bingaman, holds margin trading
accounts. Some have a second career, including songwriter Orrin
Hatch and authors Joseph Lieberman and John McCain, their financial
reports covering 1999 show.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., listed three blind trusts
together worth a minimum of $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   The annual financial reports are designed to disclose the types
of investments and liabilities lawmakers have, not their net worth,
so holdings are only reported within broad ranges. The largest
category, inhabited by one of Rockefeller's trusts, is $50 million
and up.
</P>
<P>
   Another wealthy senator, Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., owns Bank of
Montreal stock inherited from his father. It was valued at between
$25 million and $50 million, although the senator sold shares worth
$250,000 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the major asset of Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., was a
$50,000-$100,000 account in the Senate credit union that earned
between $2,500 and $5,000 in interest last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., lists only a Senate credit union
account worth less than $1,000 and debts including $15,000-$50,000
to Mastercard and a loan in the same range from the Senate credit
union.
</P>
<P>
   One senator, Christopher Bond, R-Mo., may have less money than
his son. Bond reported retirement accounts worth between $252,000
and $655,000. His son, Sam, a Princeton University student, had an
investment portfolio with assets worth between $388,000 and
$920,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, whose family money came from brick making, sued his
investment manager and PaineWebber in 1993, alleging his $1.3
million trust fund had been drained. Bond settled with PaineWebber
in 1996 for $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Bond's investments, including a trust from his grandparents'
will, were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the investors favoring computer, Internet, and
telecommunications stocks was Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
chairman of the Senate Democratic campaign organization. He owned
stock in Amazon.com, CompUSA, Global Crossing Ltd., and Egghead.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli was an active trader who bought and sold stocks the
same day.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles, R-Okla., reported owning
shares of America Online, Cisco, Compaq, Dell and Oracle last year.
He sold shares of chip maker Intel as well as Microsoft, which a
federal judge recently ordered split into two companies.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, his Democratic counterpart, Assistant Minority
Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, concentrated on real estate. He has a
property investment partnership with holdings throughout the
Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   His major assets include an office building in Las Vegas, worth
$500,000-$1 million; 100 acres of land in Bullhead City, Ariz., in
the same range; and mining claims worth $200,000-$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., owned several tech
stocks in an individual retirement account valued at $28,025:
America Online, Intel, Lucent Technologies and Microsoft. He also
holds a brokerage account worth between $3,000 and $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has a half interest in a rental real estate partnership
that owns property in Hattiesburg, Miss., worth $50,000-$100,000,
and also owns a 161-acre lot in Carroll County, Miss., in the same
asset range.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota listed ownership
in 22 investment funds and bank accounts worth between $197,000 and
$730,000. Daschle owned six apartments, but sold three of them last
year -- two in Arlington, Va., and one in Sioux Falls, S.D. --
bringing in between $45,000 and $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bingaman, D-N.M., appears willing to take some investment
risks; he has two margin accounts worth between $250,000 and
$500,000 each, allowing trades on borrowed funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, R-Utah, writes inspirational songs for performers such as
Gladys Knight. The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman earned
$6,125 in ''composing income'' for Prime Recordings Inc. of Provo,
Utah, and royalties including $500 from MTV.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, R-Ariz., received $144,579 in royalties for his book
''Faith of My Fathers'' and donated the amount to charity. He also
signed an agreement with USA Films for rights to the book.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, D-Conn., earned a $45,000 advance from publisher
Simon &AMP; Schuster for his book, ''In Praise of Public Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, owns stock in CBS and Fox
Entertainment Group. Both networks have been recipients of
Lieberman's ''Silver Sewer'' awards, aimed at embarrassing networks
that show sexually explicit or violent programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., received $12,499 for regular
appearances on the ''Face Off'' radio program and donated the
payments to charity. He is the beneficiary of trusts worth more
than $2 million, plus four trusts of unreported value.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., married last year and reported several
wedding gifts, a sculpture of a torso among them. Its value was not
listed.

   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off two points and the Standard &AMP;

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher Thursday despite two
government reports showing some surprising strength in the U.S.

</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the start of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones

<HEADLINE> Some Playgrounds Said Dangerous  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Christine Cichello's 7-year-old son, Sam, ran
over and told her what had just happened: He was hanging from the
playground's elevated rings when another boy jumped off a nearby
platform and grabbed him by the legs. Sam hit the ground
face-first.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'Mom, I hit my face really hard.' He said he was
dizzy, and within five minutes, he was unconscious,'' the Milton,
Mass., mother recalled earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Sam died that evening last October at Children's Hospital in
Boston, one of 17 children who die annually from injuries sustained
on playgrounds, according to the Consumer Product Safety
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   A report released Thursday by the U.S. Public Interest Research
Group and the Consumer Federation of America says hard playground
surfaces, equipment that is too high, openings that can entrap
children, and swings that are too close together pose serious
threats at a majority of the nation's public playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, titled ''Playing It Safe,'' researchers surveyed
1,024 public school, municipal and federal playgrounds in 27 states
and the District of Columbia between March and May. They found 80
percent had surfaces that were too hard, such as concrete, asphalt,
or packed dirt, and nearly half had climbing equipment that was too
high -- more than 6 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playgrounds can be wonderful places for children to have fun
and face new challenges, but far too many playgrounds contain
dangers that can injure and even kill,'' said Rachel Weintraub,
staff attorney for U.S. PIRG and co-author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Government figures show that 170,100 children require hospital
emergency room treatment each year because of playground accidents.
Weintraub noted that 75 percent of those injuries are caused by
falls.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also found:
</P>
<P>
   --27 percent of swings have spacing hazards, positioning them too
close to each other or to other objects.
</P>
<P>
   --31 percent of slides and climbing equipment have an inadequate
''fall zone'' because there are obstacles where a child might fall.
</P>
<P>
   --34 percent have openings in the equipment where a child's head
could become entrapped.
</P>
<P>
   --38 percent have small gaps, hooks or other protrusions where
clothing, particularly drawstrings, could become entangled.
</P>
<P>
   --47 percent have peeling, chipped or cracking paint.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fifth biannual survey conducted by U.S. PIRG and
CFA during the last 10 years. The survey showed some improvements
as older playground equipment is gradually being replaced. For
example, this year, 80 percent of playgrounds had surfaces that
were too hard, compared with 87 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Another survey released in April and conducted by The National
Program for Playground Safety at the University of Northern Iowa
examined 3,052 childcare, school and city parks and found that 46
percent had relatively new and appropriate equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really believe that the playground companies are doing a
better job of making equipment safe, and we believe the surface
manufacturers are building more appropriate surfaces,'' said
program director Donna Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, people need to do a better job of supervising
children and ensuring that smaller children and larger children
have separate play areas with age-appropriate equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Sam's mother agreed. Cichello cautioned that supervision and
limiting the number of children playing together can be just as
important as equipment safety.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just a week before Sam's fall at the Tucker School,
school officials had resurfaced the playground with wood chips -- a
covering considered safe by the CPSC.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was such a freak thing,'' Cichello said. ''Of course, you
run through things in your mind, 'If only I have done this or done
that.' I guess I wish I'd monitored the games they were playing. On
the playground you think they're safe, but sometimes I wonder if
there are just too many kids.''

<HEADLINE> Some Cities Dangerous For Walkers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Walking may be healthy exercise, but going for
a stroll in Florida can often be deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five metropolitan areas considered the most
dangerous for pedestrians are in Florida, with the Tampa region
leading the list, according to a study released Thursday by the
Surface Transportation Policy Project, a Washington-based
environmental group that advocates alternatives to driving.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing federal data from 1997 and 1998, the group found
Atlanta was the second most dangerous urban area for walking,
followed by three in Florida: Miami, Orlando and Jacksonville.
Rounding out the top 10 were Phoenix; West Palm Beach, Fla.;
Memphis, Tenn.; Dallas; and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the ''Mean Streets 2000'' report charge that
sprawling development, including wide roads without sidewalks or
frequent crosswalks, has put more pedestrians at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're spending a minuscule amount of our transportation money
trying to solve this problem. All of the energy and resources goes
to making it safer for people inside the car,'' said Roy Kienitz,
executive director of the project. ''As a result, driving is
getting safer, but walking is not getting any safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Inadequate planning and spending for pedestrians also deters
people from walking, which contributes to health problems related
to inactivity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The project study used a ''pedestrian danger index,'' which
seeks to rate relative safety. Using Census information on the
number of people walking to work, the group calculated pedestrian
safety based on fatalities relative to the number of people
walking.
</P>
<P>
   It said the number of trips taken on foot has dropped 42 percent
in the past 20 years. Americans took less than 6 percent of their
trips on foot in 1997 and 1998, while pedestrians accounted for 13
percent of all traffic deaths. Of those nearly 11,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, said he hadn't seen the study and couldn't comment.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 47 regions listed, the report said the three safest
cities for pedestrians were Pittsburgh, Boston and Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Walking is more dangerous in newer Southern and Western metro
areas designed for fast automobile travel, Kienitz said. These
sprawling communities have wider roads with fewer sidewalks and
places to cross.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that of the pedestrian deaths where location
information was recorded, 59 percent occurred in places without a
crosswalk, and another 19 percent outside a crosswalk. Ten percent
occurred in a crosswalk, while 7 percent took place on the shoulder
of a road.
</P>
<P>
   The study recommends that states match the proportion they spend
on pedestrian safety to the proportion of traffic deaths that
involve pedestrians. It also suggests that communities survey their
streets to identify problem areas, make sure new streets have
sidewalks, and create ''traffic calming'' programs to slow the
speed of drivers on local streets.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long
Island region had the largest number of pedestrian deaths, with
869, followed by the Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside region with 737
deaths.

<HEADLINE> Midwest Wants New Gas Rules Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By MARIO FOX
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- With gasoline selling for more than $2 a gallon
in their states, the governors of Illinois and Wisconsin have asked
the Environmental Protection Agency to suspend new fuel regulations
they blame for soaring prices.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Gov. George Ryan said the higher prices coincided with
the June 1 deadline the EPA set for oil companies to begin
producing cleaner-burning reformulated fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current craziness doesn't make any sense,'' the Republican
governor told reporters Wednesday. ''Something just isn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, prices have risen nationwide, but they have
skyrocketed in the Midwest, particularly in Chicago and Milwaukee.
The average cost of regular gasoline on Wednesday was $2.11 a
gallon in Chicago, $2 in Milwaukee and $1.60 nationwide, according
to the American Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson demanded that the EPA
waive the reformulated gas requirement, telling a crowd: ''We
should fight like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA spokesman Dave Ryan said Wednesday the agency was reviewing
the request. ''We are keeping all of our options open,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The price increases exceed the extra 5 to 8 cents a gallon it
costs to make the new gasoline, according to Robert Perciasepe, the
federal EPA's assistant administrator for air and pollution
programs. Federal officials met this week with refiners, asking
them to explain the price increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission agreed Wednesday to investigate
whether price-fixing or collusion was driving up prices.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said Milwaukee, Chicago and 15 other metropolitan areas
have some of the nation's worst air pollution. The agency has
mandated the cleaner, but more costly reformulated fuel since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the EPA ordered retailers to start selling a new
brand of reformulated gas -- designed to further preserve air
quality -- by June 1, though most service stations began offering
the fuel in May.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline price increases have hit the Midwest harder because of
unexpected refinery shutdowns in the region and delays in supplies
from European refiners. In addition, Midwest refineries have been
using corn-based ethanol in the reformulated gas. Ethanol -- popular
in the farm belt -- is more expensive to process than other
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he agrees with the goal of the federal program to
clean the air, but the EPA implemented the new rules too quickly
and without regard for consumer impact.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has written five letters -- without response --
requesting an EPA rollback on its rules, although not all the way
back to the dirtier fuels of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan also joined others in requesting the possible tapping of
the nation's strategic oil reserves and to call on foreign oil
countries to increase production. In addition, he said he has asked
state Attorney General Jim Ryan to look into the oil companies'
pricing policies for antitrust violations or consumer fraud.

<HEADLINE> Diana Ross, 'Supremes' Begin Tour  </HEADLINE>
By JEN LIN-LIU
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- It was billed as ''Diana Ross and the
Supremes,'' but some may have thought that ''Ross and the
Replacements'' was a more appropriate title for the trio that
kicked off their tour Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After two months of bad publicity for staging a Supremes reunion
tour without Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong, her former groupmates,
Ross set out to prove that the group she managed to assemble was
not the dupe'premes, as one critic dubbed them.
</P>
<P>
   Ross succeeded -- and failed.
</P>
<P>
   She succeeded in drenching the audience in a soulful, nostalgic
soul show. But she failed in proving that the group was the
Supremes. Don't be misled. It's a Diana Ross show with two solid
backup singers in tow. The other Supremes -- Scherrie Payne and
Lynda Laurence, who joined the group after Ross and Wilson left --
were not even on stage for about half of the show, though Laurence
had a brief solo.
</P>
<P>
   But the audience didn't seem to care, responding
enthusiastically the Supremes' classics that helped define the
Motown era, such as ''Where Did Our Love Go,'' ''Baby Love,''
''Come See About Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The show catered to people about to face a midlife crisis and
those who wish they were alive during the '60s and '70s. Footage of
Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights protests in the South
rolled out from huge overhead screens at the start of the show.
Ross, 56, looked particularly silly when she emerged for a number
in a hot pink bell-bottom pants suit.
</P>
<P>
   But amazingly enough, Ross of the new millennium is not so
different from that of several decades ago. Her voice has thickened
like molasses, but she still belts it out with a crisp, defined
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Ross sounded confident and assured, unscathed from the fiasco
surrounding the concert tour.
</P>
<P>
   It erupted after Wilson, an original Supreme, publicly
complained about being offered $2 million for the tour in
comparison with Ross, who reportedly is getting at least $15
million. Birdsong, who replaced the late Florence Ballard in the
Supremes, also did not sign on for the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Ross alluded to the controversy indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am truly honored to be onstage with two new girlfriends,''
she said, in between songs. ''Change has been inherent in the
Supremes. These girls, for me, kept the legacy alive.''
</P>
<P>
   She thanked the audience about a dozen times, which filled out a
little more than three quarters of the First Union Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke in platitudes, even more than the average beauty
queen.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who was sometimes stiff in her movements, tried to rile up
the crowd by pumping her arms occasionally and weakly took a stab
at the dance movement the ''swim.'' Thank goodness for the
energetic 20-something dancers who made their way onto the stage
every few numbers.
</P>
<P>
   When the other Supremes remained backstage, Ross seemed to gain
momentum. At those times, she seemed suddenly released from the
supreme controversy.
</P>
<P>
   During a passionate rendition of Ross' ''Ain't No Mountain High
Enough'' she was able to get nearly the entire audience on their
feet and cheering. An impressive orchestra, the dancers, Laurence
and Payne, rounded out the performance.
</P>
<P>
   The show closed on a non-Supreme note, as the trio sang ''I Will
Survive,'' the '70s classic by Gloria Gaynor. The show proved not
to be a reunion, but a good party.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 21; Dow Up 24  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today as
investors focused on how a slowdown in the economy would likely eat
away at corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 24.13 at 10,712.08.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 0.21 at 1,470.33, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 20.74 at 3,776.67.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks seesawed in early trading as investors tried to digest
new data on unemployment benefits claims and industrial production.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve said production at the nation's factories,
mines and utilities rose a bigger-than-expected 0.4 percent in May.
Analysts were forecasting a 0.3 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   But operating capacity stood at 82.1 percent in May, the same
rate as in April. That rate was below levels usually associated
with a pickup in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, the Labor Department said that 296,000
Americans filed for unemployment benefits for the week ended June
10, down by 16,000 from the previous week. Economists consider
claims below 300,000 an indication of a tight labor market,
suggesting that businesses continue to scramble for workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since
last June to slow the economy and keep inflation under control. In
recent weeks, there has been a spate of data -- including home
sales, retail sales, factory orders and unemployment -- showing a
moderation in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   While most economists believe the central bank will leave rates
unchanged when it meets later this month, they continue to seek out
signs hinting at the direction of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street has been hoping for a cooling off of the
economy, market watchers warn that a slowdown will likely have an
effect on corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   That has added some pressure to stock prices in recent days,
with investors trying to figure out the best way to play the market
now. Technology stocks have been particularly hard hit as people
move their money into more stable industrial names.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm was down $8 at $62.50 and JDS Uniphase was off $1.438
at $11.563.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors' concerns about the Fed raising interest rates is
being replaced by concerns that maybe the Fed overdid it and now
corporate earnings will not be as positive as most people had
hoped,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies Inc. was up $3.75 at $60.375 in early
trading on reports it is considering plans to spin off its
microelectronics unit in a deal analysts say could be valued at
more than $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 122.73 million
shares, down slightly from Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.80 at 506.87.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.89 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.16 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.34 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.75 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bardot Convicted for Muslim Comment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A French court on Thursday convicted French actress
and animal activist Brigitte Bardot of inciting ''discrimination,
hatred or racial violence'' after she criticized a Muslim festival
in which sheep are slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   Bardot also was fined $3,000 for a chapter in a book published
in 1999 in which she lamented that ''my country, France, my
homeland, my land is again invaded by an overpopulation of
foreigners, especially Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, ''Pluto's Square,'' she criticized the Muslim
practice of killing sheep for Aid-el-Kebir, a Muslim celebration
marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   The Movement Against Racism and for Friendship Among People had
filed the suit against Bardot.
</P>
<P>
   Bardot was previously convicted for similar remarks made in
1996.

<HEADLINE> Helms Tries To Block Aid to Russia  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Jesse Helms on Thursday moved to block a Clinton administration
$485 million loan refinancing package for Russia to protest
Moscow's continuing crackdown in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the past ten months, Russia has conducted an
indiscriminate war in Chechnya that has killed countless thousands
of innocent people and has left hundreds of thousands of others
homeless,'' the North Carolina Republican wrote in a letter to
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has the
authority to block such as expenditure without further
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The cash-strapped Russian government is attempting to
restructure billions of dollars of Soviet-era debt.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of President Clinton's summit meeting with Russian
President Vladimir Putin early this month, the State Department
announced on May 29 that it had signed an agreement to reschedule
$485 million of Russian debt to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This includes a $155 million payment due in July.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the urging of the administration and Congress...to
stop this war in Chechyna, the Russian government continues this
brutal military campaign,'' Helms wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Helms also protested what he said was Russia's continuing
support of the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. He
cited a $150 million loan to Serbia last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the government of Russia has the financial capacity to
conduct is brutal assault of Chechnya and to finance the Milosevic
regime, it certainly has the financial capacity to meet its
existing debt obligations,'' Helms wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rescheduling Russia's international debt will only reduce the
political and economic pressure that should be directed against the
Kremlin.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's total international debt is about $150 billion. Last
year, it persuaded Western industrial nations to refinance about $8
billion of that.

Missionary group's leaders may stand trial for smuggling youths
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Three leaders of a missionary group may stand
trial, despite their guilty pleas to charges that they smuggled
youngsters into the United States to work at a church-run business.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled that the leaders of the Word of Faith
World Outreach Church, based in Woodbine, Md., could withdraw their
pleas.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce E. Perdue, Robert C. Hendricks and Elizabeth Brown were
sentenced to prison last year. They appealed, saying they only
pleaded guilty because they were not permitted to present their
defense that church work is not subject to U.S. immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the church brought youths from Estonia for
training and schooling and planned to use them to clean homes and
install office furniture. They contend the Estonians made $10 to
$100 per week while church-run businesses netted thousands in
profits.

Indian state orders security for Christian schools
</P>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- After the beating death of a Roman
Catholic priest, security forces India's most populous state are
providing protection for all Christian missionary schools, the
Press Trust of India reports.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Uttar Pradesh continue to investigate the June 6
murder of the Rev. George Kuzhikandan by unidentified attackers in
Mathura, 90 miles southeast of New Delhi. Two days later there were
four church bombings in India, though no deaths resulted.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Alan de Lastic, president of the national Catholic
bishops' conference, said India's Christians face their worst
challenge in five decades.
</P>
<P>
   Christians make up just 2.3 percent of India's population of 1
billion. Relations between the two religions have deteriorated the
past two years as Hindi groups accused missionaries of using
foreign funds to entice poor, low-caste Hindus. Christians deny the
accusation.

Professors' group expresses concern on new Catholic college rules
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An American Association of University
Professors convention has expressed concern about new church
controls over U.S. Catholic colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's resolution came after the nation's bishops announced
Vatican approval of the policy. The most controversial rule says
any theology teacher must gain endorsement from the local bishop in
order to teach at a church-related campus.
</P>
<P>
   The professors' resolution urged the U.S. bishops to hold talks
with administrators and faculty to make sure the college policy is
applied in a manner ''consistent with the basic principles upon
which higher education in this country rests.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the bishops passed the new rules last November, the
academic freedom committee of the 45,000-member professors'
association expressed ''deep concern and substantial reservations''
about the text and asked the bishops to postpone action.
</P>
<P>
   That committee also commended the Association of Catholic
Colleges and Universities, Association of Jesuit Colleges and
Universities, Catholic Theological Society of America, College
Theology Society and Catholic Biblical Association for their
efforts on behalf of a more lenient policy.

Methodists get advance look at new hymnal supplement
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The United Methodist Hymnal, last
revised in 1989, is already out of date.
</P>
<P>
   The large denomination is preparing a supplement to the hymnal
and has sent 70,000 samplers to give an advance look to delegates
at regional conferences from May through July. The full song book,
''The Faith We Sing,'' is due in December.
</P>
<P>
   The 285 pieces in the $10 softcover will include contemporary
Christian ''praise choruses,'' world and ethnic music, gospel
songs, new hymns and some old standards, including hymns that were
dropped in the 1989 revision.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular of the latter is ''Eternal Father, Strong to
Save.''
</P>
<P>
   Years from now, the next edition of the full hymnal ''will be
different than anything we've seen before,'' said senior music
editor Gary Alan Smith. He considers the supplement a first step.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1989 hymnal, the supplement will be available in
CD-ROM and MIDI electronic format, and in an edition for worship
bands as well as traditional organ or piano accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   Other titles in the supplement are ''Lord, Be Glorified,''
''They'll Know We Are Christians By Our Love,'' ''I'll Fly Away,''
''Just a Closer Walk With Thee'' and ''His Eye Is On The Sparrow.''

training center for political lobbying, grassroots activism, public
relations and community leadership.

<P>
   The council said its Leadership Training Center for American
Muslims, believed to be the first of its kind, ''is a reflection of
the growing influence of Muslims and Islam in American society.''

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Nearly every day for 30 years, John
Greco would close his law practice in the mid-afternoon and make
his way up a rocky hill overlooking the city.
</P>
<P>
   A diminutive man who once considered himself too frail for the
priesthood, Greco would cart concrete, scrap metal, discarded
church statues and department store mannequins to his plot of land.
</P>
<P>
   At an age when his peers were retiring, Greco began his life's
work: a miniature representation of Jerusalem and walk-through
catechism he called Holy Land USA. Busloads of church groups -- an
estimated 40,000 people annually -- visited Holy Land after it
opened in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   But when Greco died in 1986 at the age of 90, no one knew how to
tend his labor of love. The 17-acre site, willed to an order of
nuns, has been battered by weather, vandals and neglect and is
slowly being destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Its loss is mourned by admirers of American folk art, who
consider it a treasure, and by others inspired spiritually by
Greco's creation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a service to the people,'' said the Rev. Stanley
Smolenski, who once celebrated Mass in makeshift chapels at Holy
Land. ''I don't think it should just be relegated to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The most enduring piece of Holy Land remaining is a 50-foot
cross still lights the night over this city of 106,000, a
struggling industrial center once known for the number of priests
it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, Holy Land contained 150 buildings. A cave-like
grotto, 8 feet high by 18 feet wide and housing a Nativity scene,
was the centerpiece. On the hill rising behind it were crammed
dozens of structures representing Bethlehem and Jerusalem. Beyond
that stood a rudimentary Egypt, complete with tiny pyramids and a
sphinx.
</P>
<P>
   A Roman Catholic Stations of the Cross wound through the site,
ending with a life-size hilltop representation of Jesus'
crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could be standing up to your knees in Jerusalem and the
buildings out in Waterbury looked like toy houses,'' said Sandy
Maineri, who as a child watched Holy Land develop.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibits were far from orthodox. In the 200-foot-long
catacombs, stories of martyrs were told using headless mannequins
laid in makeshift tombs. The inn in Bethlehem where Mary and Joseph
were turned away in the story of Jesus' birth had a No Vacancy sign
in motel-style lettering.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden of Eden was a trailer with its side removed; wigged
mannequins represented Adam and Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Mingled with the materials rescued from the trash were
factory-made church statues, including the contents of the Vatican
booth at the 1964 World's Fair. The pieces considered most valuable
were protected from vandals with chicken wire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything John Greco did at Holy Land was the opposite of
what is recommended for liturgical art,'' said Marek Czarnecki, an
iconographer who admires the site. ''But he did it with divine
inspiration. He just wanted to bring the experience of Holy Land to
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   As Greco's health faded, so did Holy Land's. Plywood and
plaster, the main ingredients of many displays, became warped with
exposure. The Grotto and other structures became shelter for the
homeless as the neighborhood grew poorer.
</P>
<P>
   The site was closed for renovations in 1984 and never reopened.
</P>
<P>
   A few years before his death, Greco turned over the property to
the Religious Teachers Filippini. The nuns, who cared for Greco in
his small shingled home outside Holy Land's gates, have often been
blamed for its demise.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did nothing to protect it and didn't have the vision to
have a plan,'' said Salvatore Scalora, a University of Connecticut
art professor whose classes in the early 1980s often received
guided tours from Greco.
</P>
<P>
   Others say it is unfair to criticize the nuns, whose priorities
are caring for their aging sisters and the poor. They have restored
the Holy Land chapel, where Masses are sometimes held, but don't
have the resources for an all-out restoration, said Czarnecki.
</P>
<P>
   The nuns have mainly shunned outside input and decline to
comment on the charges of neglecting the site. Sister Christine
Spirito, the leader of the order, said the site would reopen later
this year as a ''center for spirituality.'' She would not give
details.
</P>
<P>
   For a few years, a loosely organized group tried to save Holy
Land. A $100-a-plate gala raised funds, and a million-dollar
restoration plan was proposed. It went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Response from officials was, 'Yeah, this is great,' but no one
ever took hold of it and moved forward,'' said Frank Davino, a
retired city planner who still pushes for the revitalization of
Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   Today Holy Land stands eerily deserted. Some displays, including
the catacombs, have been dismantled for safety. The gates are
chained shut. A sign still proclaims ''Welcome to Holy Land.''
</P>
<P>
   The site enters the news now and then. In 1993 an independent
candidate for mayor included in his platform a vow to restore the
site. The region's tourism center still gets several calls a month.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit, Czarnecki said sadly, ''This was John Greco's
personal project and no one knew what to do with it when he was
gone.''

<HEADLINE> Comedy Central Humors Its Audience  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For a decade, Comedy Central has worked hard at
developing a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Comedy Central is about,'' says general manager Bill
Hilary, ''is being different, being nonderivative of the
(broadcast) networks, being a place for people with slightly more
outrageous tendencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Comedy Central is heating up its summer schedule with a
premiere week designed to further clarify its comic sensibilities.
Starting Sunday, the cable network will launch three series, expand
to a fifth night (Sunday) of original prime-time programming, and
unveil new episodes of seven returnees.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at 10 p.m. Eastern, look for the unrepentant ''Man
Show,'' the only talk/comedy half-hour that pledges to end each
edition with buxom females bouncing on a trampoline (and never lets
its viewers down).
</P>
<P>
   At 10:30 p.m.: The new ''Strip Mall,'' a soap-opera spoof with
comedian Julie Brown as a former child star (and murderer) who is
down on her luck, but not her wiles. Biding her time as a barmaid
at the Funky Fox Bar, she'll do anything to break free from the
demented merchants and patrons of the Plaza Del Toro shopping
center.
</P>
<P>
   Monday at 10 p.m., the cockeyed cautionary tale ''Strangers With
Candy'' returns, still asking: Can a 47-year-old juvenile
delinquent learn her lessons at high school this go-around?
</P>
<P>
   At 10:30 p.m., an inspired British comedy troupe, the League of
Gentlemen, populates a brand-new series of the same name. Three
funny chaps bring to life more than 60 residents -- men, women and a
transsexual taxi driver -- of the quaint, highly peculiar village of
Royston Valley.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking Monty Python, you're in the neighborhood.
Meanwhile, expect ''Are they local?'' to become a favorite catch
phrase among the comedy cognoscenti.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday at 10 p.m., the third launch, ''Don't Forget Your
Toothbrush,'' combines game-show elements of ''The New Price Is
Right'' and ''Let's Make a Deal'' with raise-the-roof revelry. Mark
Curry (''Hangin' With Mr. Cooper'') presides over stunts and pranks
whose payoff just might be a dandy vacation, which the winner must
embark on, toothbrush in tow, immediately upon winning it.
</P>
<P>
   Airing at 10:30 p.m. are new episodes of the original British
edition of ''Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' from which the ABC series
was adapted. Clive Anderson is host of this improv display.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday at 10 p.m.: ''South Park.'' Enough said, other than
that Comedy Central recently re-upped its most popular series for
another three seasons and at least 30 new episodes.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:30 p.m., ''Comedy Central Presents'' a half-hour of
standup that spotlights comics including Lewis Black, Kevin Nealon
and Wanda Sykes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday at 10 p.m., ''Win Ben Stein's Money'' continues to be
the only quiz show where the host is called upon to spring for the
contestant's prize -- and must defend his bankroll or go home broke.
</P>
<P>
   And at 10:30 p.m., ''Turn Ben Stein On'' features interviews
with guests including Charlie Sheen, Drew Carey and Carmen Electra.
</P>
<P>
   That's the lineup, but what's the big picture? Talk to Comedy
Central execs and you hear the words ''breakthrough'' and ''edgy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Stylistically, we want young, hip, current,'' says its
president, Larry Divney. ''This is not Leno. Or Letterman. Or even
Conan.''
</P>
<P>
   Although tickling a viewer's funny bone isn't heart surgery,
it's still a serious operation. Even so, Comedy Central has avoided
losing patients. In fact, its household audience has increased by
25 percent in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central is the only all-comedy network -- actually, a
hybrid of two faltering startups merged in 1989. But beyond that,
it reigns as the sole national comedy brand, a brand that Divney
means to extend beyond its TV boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   One vast new frontier is the network's Web site. ''We want to
build it out,'' says Divney, ''enhancing its promotional aspects
with more entertainment content. Look at it now, and again in about
two months, and then at the end of the year. You'll see three
different sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Web site's future offerings, Divney hopes to plant
cameras in undiscovered comedy clubs and transmit video of
stars-in-the-making across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Another spinoff: Comedy Central radio. A 24-hour comedy network
on radio! A no-brainer!

   ''Yeah,'' says Divney with a confident smile.
</P>
<P>
   On Comedy Central's TV network, Hilary adds, look for original
feature films before too long, as well as additional program genres
given comic treatment. ''We might even expand into sports with a
comedy twist.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilary, who came to Comedy Central from London and the BBC
earlier this year, is also hoping to introduce a live, late-night
programming block.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to showcase new talent and new ideas,'' he says. ''We
want to make sure Comedy Central is still out there, making people
ask questions about television, about comedy, about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And (it goes without saying) making people laugh.

   'NIGHTLINE': ABC News' ''Nightline'' continues its yearlong look
at a combined fourth- and fifth-grade class from Public School 27
in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, tonight at 11:35 p.m. Eastern.
''Master teacher'' Lesley-Diann Jones juggles teaching and conflict
resolution, working with one student who threatens to kill another
and dealing with a student who accuses her of calling the youngster
''an idiot'' -- a charge that gets the parent and principal involved
and almost prompts Jones to resign.

<HEADLINE> Reno Backs Penalties for Some Leaks  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno endorsed applying
criminal penalties to intentional leaks of truly classified
information that discloses intelligence sources and methods and
puts lives in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   But she balked at criminalizing accidental leaks or leaks of
improperly or overclassified information. She also said prosecutors
should continue to go after leakers and not news reporters who get
leaked information.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think prosecution can be a very great deterrent'' to leaks,
Reno told her weekly news conference Thursday. But she added, ''We
have to address how you walk the fine line between a free press
able to publish and encourage public debate and how we protect the
national security of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What we want to do is make sure that the information that is
classified is properly classified and ... that there's no ability
of people to overclassify information to limit what can be truly
discussed in the public's domain,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Reno's strong objections during a closed-door
hearing prompted senators to agree to take a closer look at their
proposed legislation to make disclosing classified information to
the news media a felony punishable by up to three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee and principal sponsor of the measure, said
he had no intentions of weakening the proposed legislation, which
the committee has approved and sent to the full Senate. The Clinton
administration opposes the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Thursday that criminal penalties should be used
''clearly where there is information that is classified, that is
appropriately classified, that if it is leaked, would reveal
sources and methods and expose people's lives to danger.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the proposed legislation could be clearer about what
classified information was covered. ''I think it is important to
make sure that we do not over-classify so as to withhold from the
public information that they should legitimately have,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ''inadvertent disclosure to someone whom you
mistakenly believe has clearance,'' Reno said, ''I think we can
craft language that can avoid criminalizing that type of conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that legislation also should reflect Justice
Department policy ''through one administration after another,
Republican and Democrat, ... that it would not go after the
reporter because of the First Amendment considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's hearing, Shelby told reporters, ''We basically
agree that we need a tougher criminal statute.'' Shelby's committee
met with Reno, CIA Director George Tenet and FBI Director Louis
Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Reno, Tenet nor Freeh spoke with reporters as they left
the committee room. Participants said Reno took the lead in
criticizing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby suggested that Reno had made several suggestions to the
committee and had agreed to work with it and its staff on possible
modifications. But, Shelby asserted, ''We're not interested in
watering anything down.''
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of classified material ''hurts us with our allies....
It puts a lot of our people, their lives, in jeopardy,'' Shelby
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada, vice chairman of the panel and its
senior Democrat, said later in an interview he said he was
optimistic a common approach could be reached that the
administration could support. He said Reno seemed genuinely
interested in working with the panel, Tenet and Freeh to ''tighten
up the language used.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some concern that the language is overly broad,''
Bryan said. ''The last thing we want to do is get involved in a
First Amendment fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The provision would give the Justice Department authority to
protect all classified information from unauthorized disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, prosecutors must show they leaked on behalf of a
foreign power or divulged ''national defense'' information..
</P>
<P>
   An unclassified report on the legislation by the intelligence
panel said the measure ''closes the gap in existing law.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine would be up to $10,000 and three years imprisonment
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment groups oppose the bill, arguing that criminal
prosecutions are not necessarily the best way to stop leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Dalglish, executive director of the Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press, predicted the measure, if enacted, would
probably result in ''an increase in subpoenas against reporters''
as prosecutors sought to build cases against accused leakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would envision more journalists in jail for not identifying
sources than leakers being sentenced for something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The House version of the legislation, passed in May, does not
contain such a provision. The Senate is expected to take up the
legislation later this month.
</P>
<P>

   The bill is S. 2507

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 3; Nasdaq Sheds 17  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed Thursday as
investors, unsettled by the latest economic figures, grew uneasy
about the effect that slower growth would have on corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 3.18 at 10,691.13.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 1.99 at 1,468.55, and the Nasdaq composite index was off
17.36 at 3,780.05.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks seesawed through most of the morning as investors tried
to digest new data on unemployment benefits claims and industrial
production.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve said production at the nation's factories,
mines and utilities rose a bigger-than-expected 0.4 percent in May.
Analysts were forecasting a 0.3 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   But operating capacity stood at 82.1 percent in May, the same
rate as in April. That rate was below levels usually associated
with a pickup in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, the Labor Department said 296,000 Americans
filed for unemployment benefits for the week ended June 10, down by
16,000 from the previous week. Economists consider claims below
300,000 an indication of a tight labor market, suggesting that
businesses continue to scramble for workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since
last June to slow the economy and keep inflation under control. In
recent weeks, there has been a spate of data -- including home
sales, retail sales, factory orders and unemployment -- showing a
moderation in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   While most economists believe the central bank will leave rates
unchanged when it meets later this month, they continue to seek out
signs hinting at the direction of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street has been hoping for a cooling off of the
economy, market watchers warn that a slowdown will likely have an
effect on corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   That has added some pressure to stock prices in recent days,
with investors trying to figure out the best way to play the market
now. Technology stocks have been particularly hard hit as people
move their money into more stable industrial names.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm was down $8.688 at $61.813 after Chase H&AMP;Q cut its
earnings and revenue estimates for the fourth quarter and next
year. That came just one day after Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. reduced its
expectations for the maker of cell-phone chips and wireless
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors' concerns about the Fed raising interest rates is
being replaced by concerns that maybe the Fed overdid it and now
corporate earnings will not be as positive as most people had
hoped,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies was the most active stock on the New York
Stock Exchange, rising $3.563 at $60.188 on reports it is
considering plans to spin off its microelectronics unit in a deal
analysts say could be valued at more than $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Coca Cola gained $1.813 to $54.813 after the company said it
reached a tentative deal to settle a race-discrimination lawsuit
from current and former employees. In addition, Salomon Smith
Barney upgraded its shares because efforts to localize the
soft-drink giant's business are beginning to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 439.24 million
shares, up from 425.96 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 4.44 at 505.23.

<HEADLINE> Woman Dies After Seeing Fake Spears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENDWELL, N.Y. (AP) -- A radio station's attempt to generate
excitement by faking an appearance by Britney Spears ended when a
woman in a crowd at the station collapsed. She died later at a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Broome County sheriff's investigators said that after a
purported interview with Spears on Tuesday night at WMRV-FM, a
woman pretending to be Spears emerged from the station to get into
a limousine. About 100 people had gathered to greet her.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a 37-year-old woman went into cardiac arrest and was
taken to a hospital. The woman, whose name was not released, died
Wednesday afternoon, sheriff's detective Jason Ellis said. An
autopsy was planned.
</P>
<P>
   A man who identified himself as the station manager but declined
to give his name said he was ''just trying to focus on the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to figure out what happened,'' he said, declining
to comment further.

<HEADLINE> Perry Withdraws From Emmy Contest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Matthew Perry proved himself a real pal,
asking that his name be withdrawn from Emmy consideration because
he was entered in the best actor category by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Since the debut of ''Friends'' on NBC, the ensemble cast has
presented a united front, each seeking only supporting actor
nominations. Perry's publicist, Lisa Kasteler, said her office
erred this year by touting him as a leading actor nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Perry immediately asked that the Academy of Television Arts &AMP;
Sciences withdraw his name. Emmy ballots went out June 5, so it's
too late for him to be named in another category.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are things more important to Matthew than awards,''
Kasteler said. ''He didn't want to separate himself from his
co-stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry's withdrawal means only David Schwimmer and Lisa Kudrow
have been nominated for Emmys from the ''Friends'' cast. Schwimmer
was nominated during the show's first season, 1994-95. Kudrow,
nominated twice, won best supporting actress in a sitcom in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Lloyd-Webber Buys Victorian Artwork  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Chalk up another top performance for Andrew
Lloyd-Webber -- although this one came in the art world rather than
on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The composer of such long-running shows as ''Cats'' paid $9
million for a painting by John William Waterhouse, the highest sum
for a work from the Victorian period, Christie's auction house
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saint Cecilia'' had been expected to sell for $3.75 million to
$5.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Lloyd-Webber, who had coveted the work for some time, drove
up the bidding. The price far outstripped the previous record, held
by Sir John Everett Millais' ''Sleeping,'' which sold for $3
million last June.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've collected Victorian paintings since I was a teen-ager,
many of which I bought for tens of pounds and this Waterhouse is
the best I've ever seen,'' said Lloyd-Webber, 52.
</P>
<P>
   The masterpiece depicts the patron saint of music covered in
flowers, asleep in an idyllic landscape.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Kent McCord, who co-starred with Martin Milner
in the NBC police drama ''Adam 12,'' believes older actors are
being shortchanged by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   McCord complained at the National Council of Senior Citizens
convention that television networks increasingly target younger
viewers with programs filled with younger cast members.
</P>
<P>
   '''Adam 12' had a tremendous children's audience, but it was
never made for children,'' McCord said. ''Hollywood should be
creating tremendous stories, then the audience will come.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Screen Actors Guild, Americans 50 and older
comprise 25 percent of the population, but own 77 percent of all
financial assets. That makes them a prime audience for advertisers,
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Candice Bergen says she feels too old to be
engaged, but that won't prevent her from tying the knot with New
York businessman and philanthropist Marshall Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's the point, really?'' Bergen, 54, said Tuesday night
after giving a lecture at the Atlanta Civic Center. ''But, yes, we
may formalize it. You heard it here first.''
</P>
<P>
   She gave no wedding date. Bergen's former husband, French
director Louis Malle, died of cancer in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen, perhaps best known for her 10-year CBS role as
television reporter ''Murphy Brown,'' said she agreed to be host of
an interview show on the cable channel Oxygen as a way to reinvent
herself. But she said the Brown character is hard to escape.

<HEADLINE> Turlington Speaks Against Smoking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Christy Turlington described her father's
battle with lung cancer and her own struggle to overcome smoking in
an address to dozens of teens at an anti-tobacco summit.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old supermodel told the group she started smoking in
her early teens and didn't stop even after her father suffered a
heart attack blamed on his smoking.
</P>
<P>
   She said she tried the nicotine patch, hypnosis, acupuncture and
other methods to break the habit but nothing worked. She finally
quit for good five years ago when she decided to ''just put the
pack down and not pick it up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Quitting smoking gave her a new sense of confidence, she said,
helping her graduate from New York University. Her father quit
smoking in 1996, but was soon diagnosed with cancer and died five
months later.
</P>
<P>
   Turlington contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the American Cancer Society but it took several
months for the agencies to agree on public service work against
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ''After all, there were all those pictures out there with me
smoking, but we finally did it,'' Turlington said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Adds Soap Actor to Resume  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- First he was a wrestler, then a politician.
Add soap opera star to the resume of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura appeared Wednesday on an episode of the CBS daytime
drama ''The Young and the Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I had butterflies before my scene. I think every
actor does,'' said Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said he became a fan of the show when he was on the road
as a professional wrestler. The governor, who played himself,
appeared in scenes with stars Eric Braeden and Melody Thomas Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he was nervous but he seemed very calm and relaxed to
me,'' said Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Braeden added: ''To walk into a production and be as calm and
collected as he was is remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who has appeared in such movies as ''Predator'' and
''The Running Man,'' was paid $706 for his appearance. The episode
will air July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would consider becoming a soap opera regular,
Ventura replied, ''I learned a long time ago, never say never.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 60; Nasdaq Gains 40  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tech stocks came back to life on Wall Street
Thursday as shares of Lucent Technologies jumped on a report that
the company was considering spinning off a microelectronics unit.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 60.10 at 10,748.05.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 7.04 to 1,477.58, and the Nasdaq composite index was up
40.30 at 3,837.71.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies was on the most-active list on the New York
Stock Exchange, rising $3.938 at $60.563 on reports it is
considering plans to spin off its microelectronics unit in a deal
analysts say could be valued at more than $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard shares also rose, gaining $5.25 to $119.25 after
the company announced plans to start an online comerce venture in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks had been mixed earlier in the day as investors tried to
digest new data on unemployment benefits claims and industrial
production.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve said production at the nation's factories,
mines and utilities rose a bigger-than-expected 0.4 percent in May.
Analysts were forecasting a 0.3 percent drop. But operating
capacity stood at 82.1 percent in May, the same rate as in April.
That rate was below levels usually associated with a pickup in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, the Labor Department said 296,000 Americans
filed for unemployment benefits for the week ended June 10, down by
16,000 from the previous week. Economists consider claims below
300,000 an indication of a tight labor market, suggesting that
businesses continue to scramble for workers.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, shares of Qualcomm fell $8.562 to $61.938
after Chase H&AMP;Q cut its earnings and revenue estimates for the
fourth quarter and next year. That came just one day after Bear
Stearns &AMP; Co. reduced its expectations for the maker of cell-phone
chips and wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola gained $3.063 to $56.063 after the company said it
reached a tentative deal to settle a race-discrimination lawsuit
from current and former employees. In addition, Salomon Smith
Barney upgraded its shares because efforts to localize the
soft-drink giant's business are beginning to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues edged out advancing issues 10-to-9 on the NYSE,
where volume came to 656.27 million shares, up from 605.13 million
shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.30 at 509.37.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Leftists Are Divided  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Carlos Martinez Renteria, a self-described
leftist, publishes a counterculture magazine that celebrates sex,
drugs and rock 'n' roll. He's also supporting a conservative
candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   The candidacy of Vicente Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive with
perhaps the best chance ever to end the 71-year reign of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, has put many Mexican leftists in
a dilemma: Any vote that does not go to Fox may help keep the PRI
in power.
</P>
<P>
   ''Supporting Fox is the riskiest, most vanguard, perhaps the
most leftist position one can take at this moment,'' Martinez said
at the office of his magazine, Generacion.
</P>
<P>
   Only three years ago, Martinez wrote newspaper columns
criticizing Fox's National Action Party for its prim line on risque
art.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is one of dozens of leftist intellectuals and
activists who have won Fox's promise to support at least some of
their positions and who have published a declaration supporting
him: ''Not One Vote for the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   That infuriates some supporters of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and his
Democratic Revolution Party, which was created in 1989 out of old
Marxist factions and breakaway leftists from the PRI, the acronym
of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the left has demonized the PRI for rigging elections,
stifling dissent at farms and factories and using violence to crush
leftist challenges -- as when soldiers gunned down hundreds of
pro-democracy student demonstrators in the 1968 Tlatelolco
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas' party accuses the PRI -- at least on local levels -- of
killing 600 of its activists over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some on the left now argue that Fox might be even worse.
They deeply distrust the pro-business outlook of his party, known
as the PAN.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN's ideology reminds many Mexican leftists of the
religious conservatives who struggled against secular government in
Mexico from independence in the 1820s until the bloody Cristero War
of the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Some PAN state governments tried to dictate skirt lengths in
public offices and to ban sexually explicit art. One PAN state
recently pressured a teen-ager who had been raped to give birth to
the resulting child.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 9 letter to the newspaper La Jornada, novelist Fernando
del Pasos argued that a vote for Fox ''is a vote in favor of the
fascism that churns in the belly of the PAN.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Never,'' he wrote, ''did we Mexicans think that we would
confront a terrible, unthinkable paradox: Expelling the PRI from
power could be the equivalent at this moment of handing over the
country to the most obscene reactionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would vote for the hated PRI to keep National Action
from power.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anguish,'' was what novelist Guadalupe Loaeza called the
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I vote for Fox, I would betray myself. ... It would be like
tossing everything I have personally fought for into the garbage,''
she wrote in the newspaper Reforma this week.
</P>
<P>
   But to let the PRI win? ''Even thinking of that possibility
chokes my throat,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has tried to dispel such fears. Among his chief advisers are
two prominent leftists who once advised Cardenas: Jorge Castaneda
and Adolfo Aguilar Zinser.
</P>
<P>
   While Fox has displayed a banner of the Virgin of Guadalupe at
his rallies, he is generally seen as a pragmatist. He promises to
support secular education, shun censorship and avoid privatizing
the state oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's quirky individualism also calms some.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fox is crazy. That saves him,'' said a grinning Martinez, who
wore a T-shirt depicting skid row novelist Charles Bukowski, jeans
and a beeper.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, polls show a left-right vote split: Fox has a
strong lead for president while a leftist ally of Cardenas leads
for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts argue that overall, Cardenas might take as many
votes from the PRI as he does from Fox. Roger Bartra of the
National Autonomous University noted that Cardenas and the PRI both
appeal to the same rural and working-class voters.
</P>
<P>
   But on an individual basis, the choice ''is arithmetic,'' said
Joel Ortega, a former Communist who organized the pro-Fox
declaration. ''A vote given to another candidate (other than Fox)
favors the official candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortega said that for generations, the PRI has meddled in ''all
aspects of daily life,'' noting that millions of Mexicans are
forced to belong to unions, business, farm or professional groups
formally linked to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important task,'' he said, ''is to free ourselves
from that domination by the PRI.''

<HEADLINE> Hostage Crisis Forces Fiji Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's military rulers ordered civil servants
on Thursday to cut government spending to lessen the economic
impact of the 28-day hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's economy has ground to a near standstill since armed
rebels led by failed businessman George Speight stormed parliament
on May 19 and took most of the Cabinet hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has demanded more rights for the country's indigenous
Fijian majority and that ethnic Indians -- who led the now-deposed
government -- be stripped of power.
</P>
<P>
   The military declared martial law and seized executive power 10
days after Speight began the standoff, holding 31 officials
captive.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say Fiji stands to lose $100 million in government
revenue as a result of the crisis on the Pacific island nation,
2,250 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government's overthrow, ethnic Indian farmers have
halted the harvest of the nation's cash crop, sugar, and tourist
bookings also vital to Fiji's economy have plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Another mainstay, garment making, has been hit by the refusal of
Australian labor unions to deal with Fijian imports or exports.
Clothes makers are running out of raw materials and have been cut
off from their main market, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The finance ministry, which is still functioning despite the
coup, will now draw up a mini budget covering spending from August
to December, military spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   It will mandate government spending cuts of at least $91 million
and measures to ensure the budget deficit does not rise above 3.5
percent of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Government spending will be concentrated on essential services
such as law and order, health, education and social welfare, as
well as supporting tourism and agriculture, Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   The finance ministry says that if spending is not slashed, the
budget deficit could balloon to 8 percent of GDP, or $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our economy cannot sustain this very high level of deficit,''
Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   The military says it wants to guide Fiji back to democracy, but
has warned it could take years before elections are held again.
</P>
<P>
   The military leader, Commander Frank Bainimarama, and Speight
are split over whether the rebels should be allowed in a new
civilian government. They also differ on the extent of an amnesty
to Speight's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, foreign ministers from Australia and New Zealand,
the two regional powers, as well as envoys from Malaysia and
Botswana arrived in the capital, Suva, seeking a way out of the
monthlong crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sooner the hostages are released and the sooner there is a
process put in place for the return to democratic government in
Fiji, the better,'' Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Downer and his New Zealand counterpart, Phil Goff, ruled out
meeting Speight, whom they have called a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not our intention to legitimize Mr. Speight by talking
to him,'' Goff said.
</P>
<P>
   Downer said the delegation would not seek a direct role in
mediating the hostages' release, which ''has to be handled by the
Fijians themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the delegation would be ''urging Mr. Speight to
release the hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the rebels briefly released one of their
hostages, former Foreign Minister Ului Kauvadra, for a medical
checkup. Kauvadra left parliament in a Red Cross ambulance and
returned about 30 minutes later.

<HEADLINE> Both Koreas Cheer Signs of Peace  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS WAGNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- From the bear hug by the two Korean
leaders in Pyongyang to the songs, cheers and tears of joy by
thousands of people in the streets of Seoul, signs of hope appeared
like never before on both sides of the world's most heavily armed
border Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with emotion reminiscent of his years as a fiery
opposition leader, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung returned
from his successful summit in North Korea to say the two countries
were close to ending decades of ''division and hostility.'' His
wife, Lee Hee-ho, wept joyfully at seeing the huge crowd of people
waving flowers and flags at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was in Pyongyang, I realized Pyongyang is our land.
People in Pyongyang are our people. And they have deep-rooted love
for their southern compatriots,'' Kim told hordes of children and
officials welcoming him home from the first inter-Korea summit
since the peninsula was divided.
</P>
<P>
   ''To us, a new day is beginning. We are at the juncture of
opening a new chapter in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kim and his wife drove through Seoul in a convoy of
limousines alongside police on motorcycles, thousands of people
lined the streets, many waving national flags and singing ''Our
Wish Is Unification,'' a song popular on both sides of the DMZ.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old president repeatedly left his limousine to shake
the hands of well-wishers in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Along the route, people carried banners or taped them to
buildings and trees. ''First step toward peace and national
unification!'' said one. ''Thanks to the summit, separated Korean
families may one day be able to stop crying,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   When the motorcade stopped at City Hall, officials released
hundreds of green, yellow, red, white and blue balloons.
</P>
<P>
   In Pyongyang, Kim and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il signed an
accord Wednesday promising to work for eventual reunification and
pledging to allow separated families to meet. The pact also calls
for South Korean investment in impoverished North Korea, but does
not address security issues.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to Seoul, however, Kim Dae-jung disclosed he and
Kim Jong Il had discussed sensitive security issues, including the
37,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in the South and the North's nuclear
and missile programs.
</P>
<P>
   Kim didn't describe in detail what he and Kim Jong Il said about
these issues, but said their talks had been frank and productive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talked about nuclear and missile issues. The issue of the
U.S. forces stationed in the South also cropped up. ... Dialogue
was very useful, and I was able to confirm that there are things
that have a bright prospect for resolution,'' he said in an airport
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The North only allowed 50 South Korean journalists to travel to
Pyongyang to cover the three-day summit. The reports they sent back
to hundreds of foreign journalists who were kept in Seoul made no
mention of the two leaders discussing missiles or U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has repeatedly demanded that the United States
withdraw its forces from the South, where Americans have been
stationed since siding with South Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang also has been widely criticized for test-firing a
long-range ballistic missile over Japan two years ago and allegedly
developing weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Washington joined China and Japan in praising the results of the
inter-Korean summit, but said it has no plans to remove any troops
from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Around Seoul, it was hard to find anyone who wasn't focused on
the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is talking about it and what Kim Jong Il said. It's
crazy. All TV stations only talk about the summit,'' said
18-year-old student Kang Hyung-sook. ''My friends talk about
unification at school. They have seldom discussed it before.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il celebrated the historic agreement with another
elaborate show of hospitality as Kim Dae-jung departed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As a military band played loudly and hundreds of North Korean
citizens waved bouquets of pink paper flowers in unison and
screamed ''Hurray!'' over and over, Kim Jong Il led Kim Dae-jung
down a red carpet on the tarmac at an airport near Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The two then clasped one another in a bear hug, and Kim Jong Il
stood at the bottom of the staircase to the plane as Kim Dae-jung
boarded his aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the two Kims held hands and sang the ''Our
Wish Is Unification'' song at a lavish banquet at a state
guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea, the state-run news agency, radio and television,
which are heavily censored and often filled with anti-South Korean
and anti-U.S. propaganda, prominently reported the summit and the
close ties that appeared to be developing between the two Kims.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea also stopped broadcasting anti-Seoul propaganda over
loud speakers along the border in the Demilitarized Zone during the
summit. Pyongyang has done that before during talks between the two
countries over issues such as food supplies to the North.

<HEADLINE> Addict Deaths Pinpointed in Britain  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Scientists have pinpointed a highly toxic bacteria
as the cause of a mysterious illness that has killed at least 35
heroin addicts, public health officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the illness, which emerged first in Glasgow and
also has been found in other areas of Scotland, England and in
Dublin, Ireland, had baffled health chiefs for more than a month.
Sixty-four infectious cases have been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Public Health Laboratory Service in Cardiff,
Wales, and experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta identified the culprit as the clostridium
bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe a batch of heroin was probably accidentally
contaminated with the bacteria when the drug was being mixed with
other substances before sale.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jai Lingappa of the U.S. centers said scientists still need
to clarify exactly how the bacteria contributed to the illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''We also want to learn more about why these people became sick
and others didn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria, Clostridium novyi Type A, is commonly found in
soil and dust and can occur in animal droppings. It grows only when
there is no oxygen, which makes it difficult to identify in a
laboratory. It is closely related to others in the clostridium
family that cause mild food poisoning, tetanus and botulism.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laurence Gruer of the Greater Glasgow Health Board said it
was unclear where in the delivery line the bacteria had
contaminated the heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is something we can only speculate on. There is a long
route bringing the heroin into the British Isles,'' he said, adding
that it could have happened at any point between western Asia, the
suspected source of most of Britain's heroin, and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Gruer said he ''hoped and believed'' the outbreak was an
isolated one.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said Type A clostridium bacteria were
responsible for outbreaks of gas gangrene during both world wars,
but that the bug this time is thriving in citric acid, which is
sometimes mixed with heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The problem occurs when the drug is injected into muscle, rather
than a vein because the acid burns and kills muscle tissue. The
bacteria infects the dead tissue and multiplies there, releasing a
toxin that enters the blood and can damage distant organs,
prompting the body to go into a deadly toxic shock.
</P>
<P>
   The affected addicts suffer initially from swelling around the
point where the needle entered the skin. The patient then usually
suffers toxic shock.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clostridium novyi Type A is well known as a cause of severe
infection in domestic animals, but rarely does so in humans,'' said
Dr. Brian Duerden, medical director of the Public Health Laboratory
Service in Cardiff. ''As far as we know this is the first time this
bacterium has ever caused an outbreak of infection in drug
injectors.''
</P>
<P>
   If found early enough, the bacteria can be killed by
antibiotics, and surgeons can remove infected tissue, health
officials said. But the resulting toxin is resistant to antibiotics
and very poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   Gruer said the most accurate figures available to date showed
that 20 people in Scotland, eight in Dublin and seven in England
and Wales had died of the illness.
</P>
<P>
   Other health authorities also are investigating deaths that may
bring the total to 39, and three deaths in middle England that
police said were linked to the illness have not been included in
the figures, Gruer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Glasgow health board has advised heroin addicts to smoke the
drug rather than inject it.

<HEADLINE> Discounts Boost Expo's Attendance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, Germany (AP) -- Cut-rate evening tickets have led to a
surge in visitors at the World's Fair in Hanover as organizers seek
to combat complaints about pricey bratwurst and other costs too
dear for the average pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Expo 2000 said 101,000 people visited the
156-nation exhibit Wednesday, far more than the 60,000 daily
average since it opened June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 13,000 people snapped up discounted evening tickets for
$5, down from $12 during the day, fair spokesman Andreas
Lampersbach said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fair visitors have complained of admission prices ranging up to
$43 and budget-breaking food prices, such as a lowly bratwurst that
normally goes for $1.50 costing $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting dignitaries Thursday included the wife of Russian
President Vladimir Putin, Lyudmila Putina, accompanied by
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's wife, Doris Koepf-Schroeder, and
Christina Rau, German President Johannes Rau's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Also touring the fair were Prince Rainier of Monaco and two of
his grown children, Prince Albert and Princess Caroline, as well as
his son-in-law, Prince Ernst-August of Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is playing host to the fair for the first time, taking
up a tradition begun in 1851.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had once projected up to 150,000 visitors daily at the
$1.8 billion event. But critics say the five-month fair could lose
more than $500 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tech stocks came back to life on Wall Street
Thursday as shares of Lucent Technologies jumped on a report that
the company was considering spinning off its microelectronics unit.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 53.48 at 10,741.43.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 6.50 to 1,477.04, and the Nasdaq composite index was up
37.64 at 3,835.05.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent was the second-most actively traded stock on the New York
Stock Exchange, rising $4.188 at $60.813 on reports it is
considering plans to spin off its microelectronics unit in a deal
analysts say could be valued at more than $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard shares also rose, gaining $4.563 to $118.563
after the company announced plans to start an online commerce
venture in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks had been mixed earlier in the day as investors tried to
digest new data on unemployment benefits claims and industrial
production.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve said production at the nation's factories,
mines and utilities rose a bigger-than-expected 0.4 percent in May.
Analysts were forecasting a 0.3 percent drop. But operating
capacity stood at 82.1 percent in May, the same rate as in April.
That rate was below levels usually associated with a pickup in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, the Labor Department said 296,000 Americans
filed for unemployment benefits for the week ended June 10, down by
16,000 from the previous week. Economists consider claims below
300,000 an indication of a tight labor market, suggesting that
businesses continue to scramble for workers.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, shares of Qualcomm fell $9.438 to $61.063
after Chase H&AMP;Q cut its earnings and revenue estimates for the
fourth quarter and next year. That came just one day after Bear
Stearns &AMP; Co. reduced its expectations for the maker of cell-phone
chips and wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola gained $3.063 to $56.063 after the company said it
reached a tentative deal to settle a race-discrimination lawsuit
from current and former employees. In addition, Salomon Smith
Barney upgraded its shares because efforts to localize the
soft-drink giant's business are beginning to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues edged out advancing issues 10-to-9 on the NYSE,
where volume came to 771.77 million shares, up from 725.78 million
shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.79 at 508.88.

<HEADLINE> UN's Lebanon-Israel Mission Halted  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH PANOSSIAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABBASSIYEH GATE, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli soldiers fired warning
shots Thursday into the ground near the feet of a U.N. team heading
their way to inspect the newly drawn international border.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries. Israel apologized to the United Nations,
and said it was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting forced the suspension of the verification of the
Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, as the Lebanese army
officials accompanying the U.N. team withdrew from the mission and
returned to Beirut. The U.N. officials were summoned to their base
in Naqoura.
</P>
<P>
   While underscoring the volatility of the frontier, the shooting
also was a reminder of the difficulties faced by U.N. officials in
demarcating the border, which they had hoped to complete within
days of the abrupt Israeli pullout May 24.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers will be deployed at the border after the
United Nations completes verification of the Israeli withdrawal.
Until then, anti-Israeli guerrillas, will remain the only real
authority on the Lebanese side of the border zone.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's incident also cast a pall on plans by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to visit Lebanon on Monday. U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said the timing of Annan's trip was ''linked
to the final confirmation of Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard said the Israelis ''admitted it happened. They said it
was a stupid mistake and let's get on with the verification
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   He said four shots passed over the heads of the verification
team and one hit the ground in front of the deputy force commander.
But journalists who were with the team -- including an Associated
Press reporter -- said three bullets hit the ground about 10 feet
from the team.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting began after eight U.N. and four Lebanese officers
got out of U.N.-marked vehicles and walked about 150 yards toward a
barbed wire fence. The shots rang out as the officials unchained a
gate on the fence and were about to step through to go toward the
village of Abbassiyeh.
</P>
<P>
   The firing came from the remnants of a vacated post about 50
yards away on the U.N.-drawn border that the team wanted to
inspect. The U.N. spokesman in Lebanon, Timur Goksel, said the
fence was inside Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli army northern front commander Maj. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi
apologized to the U.N. commander in Lebanon, Israeli officials
said. They quoted Ashkenazi as saying the soldiers opened fire
after they saw a group of civilians and journalists try to cut
through the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. officers were wearing the trademark blue berets of
peacekeeping missions and U.N. vehicles were parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Israeli forces abandoned a position 1.2 miles
west of Abbassiyeh Gate and pulled back about 200 yards to inside
Ghajar. The village has been sliced in two by the U.N.-drawn
border. One part is in Lebanon and the other in the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which was captured from Syria in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Ghajar residents have been protesting the division of their
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have nothing against the Lebanese brethren,'' said Suleiman
Khatib, who identified himself as Ghajar mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we want is that the village does not get divided. Do not
separate fathers from sons and mothers from their children,'' he
said, speaking through a loudspeaker when the U.N. and Lebanese
team inspected the border in their village.

<HEADLINE> E. Coli Probed in 3 Canada Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The Ontario coroner's office said Thursday that
three more deaths were being investigated for links to an E. coli
contamination that has killed at least seven people and sickened
hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   The three deaths under investigation occurred between May 5 and
May 19, before authorities issued a warning and told residents of
Walkerton to boil their water. Some 14 deaths are now being
studied.
</P>
<P>
   The three additional victims were an 81-year-old woman who died
in Walkerton on May 5; a 27-year-old woman who died in Kitchener on
May 18; and a 93-year-old woman who died in Walkerton on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   On May 21, health officials issued a boil order for Walkerton
water, several days after the local utility knew that wells were
contaminated in the town, 90 miles west of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Six adults and a 2-year-old child previously were identified as
fatal victims of the E. coli contamination. All seven of the other
deaths under investigation were adults.
</P>
<P>
   The contamination was the worst known E. coli outbreak in North
America, and officials have yet to determine what caused it. Health
and environment officials are focusing on two wells that supplied
water to Walkerton, one of which had a malfunctioning chlorination
system before the E. coli outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli is an intestinal bacteria often spread through animal or
human feces that gets into water supplies. It causes nausea,
diarrhea, cramps and in severe cases, kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   Four separate investigations of the contamination have been
announced -- by Ontario Provincial Police, health and environment
officials, the Ontario coroner's office, and a public inquiry
expected to begin in upcoming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A boil order for town water was likely to continue for at least
six more weeks as all water pipes and supplies get flushed and
tested. The Ontario Clean Water Agency has taken over control of
the town's water system from the local utility.
</P>
<P>
   In Walkerton, residents depend on bottled water donated by other
communities, businesses and charities, and also either bleach or
boil the water to treat it. Some have left town, or visit friends
and relatives in other communities for a bath or shower.

<HEADLINE> Pope Invites Homeless to Lunch  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The invitation came on crisp white paper,
with a picture of the host on the front: ''The Holy Father John
Paul II, on the occasion of the Grand Holy Year of 2000, invites
Mr. Antonio Buoniconti to share in a friendly gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoniconti, receiving the invitation at a Rome soup kitchen,
since no mail delivery is possible at the doorway that is his fixed
address, gratefully accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Donning his best jeans and only windbreaker, the 39-year-old
Neapolitan joined 199 of Rome's homeless at the Vatican on Thursday
for lunch with the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best thing is to see the pope close up,'' Buoniconti said,
milling with fidgeting fellow guests among the rose bouquets,
damask tablecloths and stainless-steel place settings while waiting
for their host.
</P>
<P>
   Extending his invitation via Rome's soup kitchens and homeless
shelters, John Paul sought and found guests from all the world's
continents, who had drifted to Rome in hopes of jobs, or just
drifted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Among all my Holy Year appointments, this for me is certainly
one of the most felt and most significant,'' the white-robed
pontiff told his guests.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to meet them, I wanted to share this meal with you,
to say that you are in the heart of the pope. I embrace each one of
you with great affection, my very dear friends,'' John Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine homeless people froze to death in what was an
unusually cruel winter for them in Rome, throwing the city's
services for them in sharp contrast with its lavish spending for
Holy Year preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Charities said some of the deaths came because Holy Year
reconstruction projects had thrown street people out of their usual
haunts. One woman froze to death a few hundred yards from St.
Peter's.
</P>
<P>
   The church, which has said it wants even the poor to be able to
make Holy Year pilgrimages here, as of this summer is providing 500
meals daily in soup kitchens at St. Peter's and three other Rome
basilicas.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's menu was a little fancier than what the soup kitchens
normally serve, paying all due Roman reverence to a good meal:
ravioli, roast veal with potatoes, salad, fruit salad with ice
cream, with wine and spumante, and coffee to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks again for your presence,'' John Paul said, adding
thanks also for an orchestra of performing priests playing
selections -- ''La Bamba,'' ''O Sole Mio'' and the African ''Jambo
Jambo'' meant to make both Italian and international guests feel at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Seminary students circulated among the tables, waiting on
families with squirming children, near-toothless men with grizzled
beards, women in their 70s and in their best dresses for the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials ate alongside the guests. John Paul, flanked
by eight of the poor, started the meal by clasping the hands of a
frail, white-haired woman on his right, sipped espresso while some
guests danced, and stayed long enough afterward to pat children
carried up to his table by a line of beaming parents.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapping Revives Brazil Gun Bill  </HEADLINE>
By STAN LEHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- The killing of a hostage and her
kidnapper in Rio de Janeiro has prompted Brazil's Congress to take
up a long-stalled bill to ban the sale and possession of guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress is very sensitive to tragedies in society. The
episode in Rio created a greater sense of urgency that we need to
control guns,'' Sen. Eduardo Suplicy said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was proposed after the 1999 shootings at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., but has languished since then. On
Wednesday, the Senate Committee for Justice, Constitution and
Citizenship approved the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to be approved in the Senate and then go to
the Chamber of Deputies, where it must pass in committee and floor
votes. Altair Goncalves Soares, the committee secretary, said the
proposal still could be modified and would take weeks or months
before it becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would restrict possession of firearms to the armed
forces, police, private security personnel, collectors, gun clubs
and residents of rural areas. Everyone else would have 360 days to
turn in their guns and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   According to government figures, Brazilians own an estimated 8
million guns, of which about 6 million are unregistered and mostly
in the hands of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rio has a reputation for violent crime, the kidnapping
and killings on Monday shocked even jaded Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   For four hours, a 21-year-old ex-convict held passengers hostage
on a city bus. As TV cameras broadcast the scene live, he put a .38
caliber revolver in the mouths of several women and threatened to
kill them unless he received weapons and money to escape.
</P>
<P>
   When the kidnapper finally got off the bus holding a young woman
hostage, a policeman jumped up and fired from close range with a
submachine gun but missed. The kidnapper shot the woman,
20-year-old art teacher Geisa Goncalves, and she died in the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapper, Sandro do Nascimento, apparently was unhurt when
he was shoved into a police wagon but mysteriously turned up dead
at the hospital. An autopsy showed he died of asphyxiation, and
hospital officials said the five arresting officers pressured them
to list the cause of death as gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Rio de Janeiro state security chief Josias Quintal said the five
were arrested and will be charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said he was ''depressed'' by
the violence and the ineptness of police.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cardoso met with top aides to put the final
touches on a National Security Plan, which the government plans to
announce next week.
</P>
<P>
   Although no details were released, Brazilian media say the plan
includes hiring 2,000 new federal police agents, construction of
prisons for at least 40,000 inmates and better training and
equipment for police forces.
</P>
<P>
   It would also ban the sale of guns to neighboring countries.
Authorities say that many Brazilian-made guns are exported to
neighboring Paraguay and Argentina and then smuggled back in to
supply a thriving black market of contraband weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lawmakers were leery that the plan would be little more
than good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it includes money, fine,'' said Rep. Michel Temer,
president of the Chamber of Deputies. ''If it's just more laws,
give up.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Alec Baldwin's Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Alec Baldwin can now get on with his life.
</P>
<P>
   The California Supreme Court said Wednesday it won't review a
lower court ruling that a celebrity photographer is not entitled to
recover the costs of a lawsuit he filed against the actor.
</P>
<P>
   The legal wrangling stems from a 1995 fight that broke out after
Alan Zanger videotaped Baldwin and his wife, actress Kim Basinger,
with their newborn daughter, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin sprayed Zanger's truck with shaving cream and broke his
nose and his glasses. Baldwin claimed he was defending himself.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin was acquitted of misdemeanor battery in a 1996 trial,
but found partly to blame for the fight in a separate proceeding.
Zanger's appeal asked for $18,000 in legal costs.

<HEADLINE> Census Workers Face Safety Pitfalls  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The challenge seems inviting: Join the Census
Bureau and help take the national head-count!
</P>
<P>
   For some, this is dangerous business. One enumerator was killed
by a pack of dogs and other census-takers have been shot at,
encountered slammed doors and fallen while retreating from angry,
uncooperative people.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Census officials reiterated that the safety of its
employees was of ''paramount importance'' -- even if it means not
getting the job done right away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've sent out as strong a signal that we possibly can that
the first concern we have is the safety of our census-takers,''
Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said at a news conference. ''We
have census-takers in difficult situations, of course, especially
now when we are down to the last cases.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current door-to-door phase of the count, enumerators
still have about 900,000 of the country's 120 million households
left to contact, residents who have not yet returned a Census 2000
form.
</P>
<P>
   Beside the woman killed by dogs, six other U.S. Census workers
have died on the job this year, five in auto accidents and one
because of a stroke. Agency officials could not immediately say how
many have been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Nashville, Ind., say it appeared 71-year-old
Dorothy Stewart was trying to count the residents of a one-story
log cabin when dogs attacked her. She died of multiple injuries.
Brown County sheriff's deputies arrived Saturday to find Stewart's
body about 3 feet from the home's front door, surrounded by more
than 20 dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The driveway leading up to the house is posted with ''Beware of
Dog'' and ''No Trespassing'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Jim Oliver said he has not ruled out filing criminal
charges against the dogs' owners, and is continuing his
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Census Bureau's national office in Suitland,
Md., called Stewart's death an isolated, but tragic incident. They
could not recall an incident similar to her death, but said workers
are warned about risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''They go through training which talks about potential dangers,
that if you feel uncomfortable, you leave the situation,'' said
Jerry Stahl, spokesman for the Charlotte, N.C., regional Census
office. ''But there's not extensive self-defense training or
something of that nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Since most census-taker jobs are part-time, they do not have
benefits, but are covered under workers' compensation guidelines,
Stahl said.
</P>
<P>
   Enumerators who feel unsafe can refer cases to supervisors. It
is up to local Census offices to determine whether workers should
be sent out in pairs for safety's sake in some areas, and some
local managers have asked police departments to monitor blocks
where census-takers are working, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, those in the field say safety isn't a great
concern, whether they work in high-crime neighborhoods or rural
areas. Some go to unusual lengths to complete the task -- like
census-takers in Maine who hitched rides on lobster boats to reach
isolated island homes, or workers in upstate New York who used
snowmobiles to traverse roads left otherwise impassible by snow.
</P>
<P>
   ''In general, the job is fairly safe,'' said Nelson Bofford of
Lake Luzerne, N.Y., who worked as an enumerator in upstate New
York. ''But I believe the training was pretty good. They went out
of their way to make sure you are properly trained before you get
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other enumerators say they've been pleasantly surprised by the
responses they get at the door.
</P>
<P>
   ''One person offered me pie one time,'' said Michael Zdan, a
census-taker from Bear Creek, Pa.

<HEADLINE> HIV Diagnosis Changes Sex Behavior  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The vast majority of people diagnosed with the
AIDS virus begin using condoms or curtail their sexual activity
after testing positive, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of those interviewed in the 1997-98 study said
they changed their sexual behavior after learning they were
infected.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, 60 percent said they used condoms more often, about
half had sex less frequently, and more than a third stopped having
sex altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
involved 180 people in Alabama, New Jersey and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said the results show the importance of setting up more
HIV testing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We generally found that once people that are infected know
their status, they do adopt safer behaviors. It has tremendous
public health implications,'' said Patricia Sweeney, a CDC
epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 900,000 people in the United States are infected with
HIV, though an estimated one-third have not been diagnosed, the CDC
said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Sens. Hold Up Plant's Coal Switch  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two senators from major coal-producing states
are holding up a plan to use cleaner fuel in a power plant that
heats and cools the U.S. Capitol. The coal-burning plant is among
the city's worst polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., sent a
letter to Capitol architect Alan Hantman last month after Hantman's
office gave Congress a plan to upgrade the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were troubled to learn that the proposed master plan would
require the elimination of coal as a fuel for the Capitol steam
plant and instead rely exclusively on fuel oil and natural gas,''
the senators said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers ended the letter by urging Hantman to ''carefully
evaluate several options to preserve coal as a primary fuel for the
Capitol power plant.''
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia and Kentucky are the second- and third-ranked coal
producing states, trailing only Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hantman said the architect's office is reviewing
its plan for the plant, which heats and cools the Capitol, Library
of Congress, Union Station and congressional buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question, based on the issues raised by Byrd and
McConnell, we're re-examining it,'' Bruce Milhans said.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly century-old plant, a few blocks from the Capitol,
uses coal to heat the buildings in the winter. In the summer, it
uses a combination of natural gas and electricity to cool the
structures.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is one of the city's single biggest emitters of
nitrogen oxide, a component of smog, said Theodore Gordon, senior
deputy director for public health assurance in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The city and its suburbs consistently violate smog standards, so
Gordon would like it if the plant stopped burning coal, which
produces more pollution than natural gas or fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, McConnell and Byrd urged Hantman to ''consider
existing and emerging coal technologies that are currently
available, which would increase the efficiency and reduce the
environmental impact of the existing coal boilers.''
</P>
<P>
   They say it would save taxpayers' money because coal is cheaper
than natural gas or fuel oil. The country also has a larger reserve
of coal.
</P>
<P>
   Don Wambsgans, program manager of the city's air quality
division, agrees there are cleaner ways to burn coal. He said they
sometimes involve converting coal to a gas or mixing it with
limestone to produce less pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Milhans said the architect's office was evaluating the cost of
those kinds of technologies.
</P>
<P>
   He said Hantman would report back to the House and Senate
appropriations committees with a new range of options by the fall.
McConnell and Byrd are on the Senate Appropriations Committee,
which approves government spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is up to Congress to ultimately decide what course they
want to take,'' Milhans said. ''The architect of the Capitol works
for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell's spokesman, Robert Steurer, said it was too soon to
say whether the senators would try to block funds for the upgrades
if coal were not included in the plan. The estimated cost for the
original plan was $60 million.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Lashes Out at Barak  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yasser Arafat lashed out at Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak on Thursday, saying the man he once described
as his peace partner ''lacks the desire to work with us in order to
achieve a comprehensive peace in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader denounced Barak in the White House
driveway after meeting for more than three hours with President
Clinton in a bid for help to achieve his goals. First among them: A
state with its capital in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations sputtered along here, partly broken off by the
Palestinians to protest Israel's refusal to release 250 prisoners
and to agree to Arafat's terms for an Israeli pullback this month
on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is prepared to declare statehood without Israel's
approval if a settlement is not concluded by the Sept. 13 deadline
the two sides have set.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and State Department voiced tepid support for
Barak, whose willingness to yield territory on all fronts to the
Arabs had been from them a pleasant contrast to the grudging line
taken by his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we are satisfied that both leaders are very serious in
their efforts to reach an agreement,'' P.J. Crowley, spokesman for
the National Security Council, said.
</P>
<P>
   In a similarly low key statement when pressed by reporters,
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said ''both remain
committed to achieving a peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, kept his distance from the angry Palestinian
rhetoric. He responded to a few questions at a picture-taking
session in the Oval Office at the start of his meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are going to make peace we are going to have to deal
with the difficult issues,'' he said as he sat side-by-side with
Arafat. ''The less we say now about it, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at a joint news conference with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in Ramallah, a Palestinian town on the West
Bank, Arafat bristled when a reporter asked whether he still
considered Barak a partner for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to respond, Arafat said the question was designed to
disrupt the peacemaking process.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations resumed at two air force bases here Tuesday
after a two-week break and immediately drifted into disagreement.
American mediators Dennis B. Ross and Aaron D. Miller conferred
with the two delegations, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
invited Arafat to lunch at her home in the Georgetown area of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I should characterize what is going on,''
Clinton said of the slow-paced discussions. ''The only thing I can
tell you is I want to finish the job, and I'd like to see it
finished on time.''
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's meeting, Arafat praised Clinton for trying to
keep the peace negotiations alive ''at this difficult time and in
the face of the obstacles we're facing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton last year voiced his support for Palestinian
''aspirations'' on a trip to Gaza. But any suggestion he would prod
Israel or the Palestinians to make concessions was dismissed
Thursday by his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not in the position to pressure them,'' Crowley said.
''They understand that time is not on their side. ... I don't think
we have any quarrel with the firmness by which the leaders and
their negotiating teams are working hard to see what can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   A settlement is Clinton's highest foreign policy priority in the
little more than seven months he has remaining in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talked to Barak on the telephone for 40 minutes
Wednesday and said the two sides were not ready for a Camp
David-style three-way meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we need to get the parties a little closer before we
can go there,'' Clinton said. ''We don't have a lot of time. We're
down to all the hard issues now, and we're working on it. I'm
hopeful, but I don't want to hold out false hopes.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Resists U.S. Supervision  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The United States pressed Thursday for greater
U.S. supervision of Israeli weapons exports and sought to persuade
Israel to cancel the sale of a spy plane to China, but Israel was
unreceptive.
</P>
<P>
   The Haaretz daily said the United States has drawn up a list of
27 countries it considers problematic destinations for Israeli
weapons, including China and India, two major Israeli clients.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials reject the idea of U.S. monitoring, but
refused to comment directly Thursday, fearing diplomatic
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, most Israeli weapons systems included U.S.
components, and since the United States bans re-export of its
technology without its agreement, Washington had automatic
supervision over most deals.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel's weapons manufacturers now can build sophisticated
arms without using American technology, forcing the United States
to look for new ways to monitor Israel's exports.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is concerned that Israeli military high-tech
will end up in the wrong hands and endanger U.S. troops, said a
U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the U.S. State Department and the Pentagon raised
the issue Thursday with the director general of the Israeli Defense
Ministry, Amos Yaron.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, disagreement erupted over Israel's contract
to sell a plane equipped with the PHALCON early warning system to
China.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is building one now, and China has an option to buy at
least three more. The U.S. is trying to force cancellation of the
sale, pointing to renewed tensions between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have said the dispute is over business, not
security, and that the U.S. government is trying to shield its own
arms manufacturers from Israeli competition. Israel says the system
has no American components.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an element of superpower bullying here,'' said Efraim
Inbar of Bar Ilan University's Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic
Studies. He said American supervision would lead to the
cancellation of some deals, and that this could destroy Israel's
arms industry and endanger Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of policy, Israel does not comment on arms exports
or release official sales figures. Inbar estimated that Israeli
arms manufacturers sell $2 billion worth of arms a year, 75 percent
to foreign countries and 25 percent to the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh told Israel's parliament
Wednesday that Israel needs to keep exporting on a large scale to
finance the development of new weapons systems and stay a step
ahead of its enemies.
</P>
<P>
   An example of Israel's homegrown sophistication is the Merkava
tank, in use here since the 1980s, replacing U.S.-made models. For
the first time, the Merkava will be on display next week at
Eurosatory, a weapons exhibition in Paris. The Israelis are
showcasing its locally developed high-tech features, including
optical devices.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli arms have shown up all over the world, sometimes after
shady third-party deals, but also when Israel has acted as an agent
for the United States in touchy political circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Israel transferred TOW anti-tank missiles and
other weapons to Iran in a four-sided deal that involved the United
States and Nicaragua. The sales were part of a Washington scandal
that became known as Irangate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do their dirty work,'' said Inbar, referring to the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Former Chiefs of Staff Trade Advice  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former White House Chief of Staff James Baker
III says the job is the second toughest in Washington, right after
the presidency. Jack Watson Jr., who had the job under President
Carter, likens it to shortstop. And Leon Panetta, who served
President Clinton, says, ''You've got to be a battlefield
commander.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten former White House chiefs of staff who served the past five
presidents traded stories Thursday and offered tips to future
members of their club.
</P>
<P>
   Some advice:
</P>
<P>
   --Don't let the president's agenda drift off course.
</P>
<P>
   --Remember that everything on your desk might be subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   --Be tough enough to tell the president he is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   --Step softly on egos on Capitol Hill, but find opportune moments
to roll the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't be too visible.
</P>
<P>
   --Stay grounded in reality.
</P>
<P>
   --Have a good nose because a lot smells fishy.
</P>
<P>
   --And don't hang up on the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shortly after the elections this November, somebody is going
to wake up and realize that in a very, very few weeks, he or she
will lead a team into the literal nerve center of the world. Today,
as we all know, White House mistakes reverberate loud and long,''
Baker, chief of staff for Presidents Reagan and Bush, told the
gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was the only person in history dumb enough to take it
twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs of staff handle crises and scandals, politics and policy.
They influence who sees the president and what he reads. He is
gatekeeper to the Oval Office. Nevertheless, Baker cautioned: ''The
chief of staff is very powerful, but he's not a king.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he often felt like a shortstop. ''You're cutting
short the balls to keep them from getting ... all the way to the
president,'' he said. ''You're making a lot of decisions that the
president never knows about.''
</P>
<P>
   In that role, it helps to have a good nose, says Kenneth
Duberstein, a chief of staff for Reagan, because a lot of things in
Washington ''smell a little fishy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs of staff are also charged with smoothing relationships
with interest groups, political bigshots, Congress and news-hungry
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably did the lousiest job of dealing with the press that
any chief of staff has ever done,'' said former Bush chief of staff
John Sununu, who was forced out in 1991 amid controversy over his
acerbic style and personal travel at government expense. Sununu
said he favored on-the-record interviews in deference to a
president who loathed leaks, but now feels he should have spoken
privately to reporters more often to weave the president's message
into their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Panetta, hired to reorganize the Clinton White House in
mid-1994, said when he took the post, one staff member compared the
situation to a grammar school soccer game where players were out of
position -- all running after the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, the ball is always in the Oval Office,'' said Panetta,
whose response was to set up a clear chain of command, focus
Clinton's energies to prevent 10 competing messages from coming out
of the White House on the same day and control access to the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who wanted to see Reagan had to get through the Howard
Baker blockade first.
</P>
<P>
   ''They weren't going in unless I was along so that we knew
exactly what had happened and the president would never be caught
in a cross fire,'' said Baker, who joined the Reagan White House to
reshape the president's image after the Iran-contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Erskine Bowles, one of Clinton's four chiefs of staff, said one
goal of being a president's chief of staff is surviving the White
House stint, which he says runs faster than the dot-com world. One
minute, it's health care. The next minute, it's Kosovo, Iraq,
welfare reform, the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''And, oh, on the side, you deal with a little thing called
impeachment,'' Bowles said. ''I found that the only way I could
manage in this 'gotcha' environment in Washington is not to allow
myself to float up with the highs because the lows came too quickly
thereafter and I wasn't able to keep the White House moving forward
on a steady course.''

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Court Acquits Bishop  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- A Roman Catholic bishop accused of helping
orchestrate the 1994 slaughter of more than a half-million Rwandans
was cleared of genocide charges on Thursday and set free.
</P>
<P>
   A Rwandan court ruled the prosecution failed to prove that
Augustin Misago had participated in meetings during which Rwanda's
former extremist Hutu government formulated plans to kill minority
Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   Misago was accused of being present when members of the former
government discussed plans to kill Tutsis at roadblocks and in
schools and churches during the 100-day blood bath between April
and July 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old bishop was specifically accused of ordering the
killings of three Tutsi priests and schoolchildren who had sought
his protection -- part of the seven genocide charges that the court
dismissed one by one in the 90-minute ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm extremely happy that justice and truth have triumphed,''
said Misago, a large crucifix hanging from his neck, as he sagged
in his chair, dressed in prison-issued pink shirt and shorts. He
had been jailed for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court orders Misago freed. Misago has won the trial,''
Presiding Judge Jaliere Rutaremara said on behalf of the
three-judge panel, setting off an explosion of applause in the
packed courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Misago had denied any responsibility for the massacres, saying
he was wrongly arrested on orders of former President Pasteur
Bizimungu. If convicted, Misago would have faced a mandatory death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The highly publicized trial strained Rwanda's relations with the
Vatican. Misago is the highest-ranking Roman Catholic cleric among
more than 20 nuns and priests accused of participating in the
genocide; two priests have already been convicted and sentenced to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the acquittal, the Vatican envoy to Rwanda, Papal
Nuncio Salvatore Pennachio, said: ''It's a day of justice and of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Jozef Tomko, head of the Vatican's missionary division,
called the verdict ''a very joyous happening for the church, not
only in Africa, but on a universal level,'' according to Fides, the
Vatican missionary news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution said it would appeal the decision within 15
days.
</P>
<P>
   Misago, a Hutu, was bishop of the southern Rwandan diocese of
Gikongoro, where tens of thousands died at the hands of Hutu
soldiers, militiamen and ordinary civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Many victims were killed in churches, sometimes with the
suspected complicity of priests and nuns. The slaughter ended when
Tutsi-led rebels drove the government and army from power in July
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody can accuse Misago of not assisting the victims, because
it is up to the authorities, not the church, to ensure the security
of the people and the state,'' Rutaremara said in the court's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   During his meetings with Rwandan political and military
officials, Misago had always appealed for peace, the court said.
His ''good relations'' with local authorities were not sufficient
reason to condemn him.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Misago met with a former governor, apparently to
discuss the fate of 90 Tutsi schoolgirls, but the prosecution
failed to prove he was responsible for their subsequent deaths, the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, some Rwandans reacted bitterly to the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a political trial and we, the genocide survivors,
continue to be victimized,'' said Fidele Rwamuza, who traveled 60
miles from Gikongoro to hear the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   More than 125,000 genocide suspects are jailed in Rwanda. More
than 1,500 have been tried so far, and 300 have been sentenced to
death. The first 22 were publicly executed on April 24, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chile Storm Leaves 60,000 Homeless  </HEADLINE>
By EVA VERGARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A powerful storm drove some 60,000 people
from their homes during a midweek rampage across central Chile,
flooding low-lying parts of the capital with the heaviest rains in
years.
</P>
<P>
   Three days of rain tapered off Wednesday after soaking Santiago
and a wide swath of the countryside as heavy snow blocked border
crossings with Argentina. The storms, which brought high winds,
signaled the approach of winter in the South American hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   President Ricardo Lagos delayed a flight to Colombia for a
regional summit and surveyed inundated farm fields and slum
neighborhoods by helicopter, ordering the armed forces to help
after declaring an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The army has spread out to the affected neighborhoods, and is
working at the task of removing the mud,'' Lagos said. While tens
of thousands of Chileans remained displaced for a second day, many
others began returning home as floodwaters receded.
</P>
<P>
   Health authorities warned Thurdsay of a possible outbreak of
influenza and other respiratory diseases, saying a combination of
cold weather and flooded homes made the elderly and young
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, the storm cleared the air and afforded unusually
sparkling clear vistas of the snowcapped Andes mountains, giving
residents a reprieve from the gritty smog that envelopes Santiago
much of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At higher elevations in the Andes, heavy snowfall was reported.
On Wednesday, key border crossings with neighboring Argentina were
closed and some 300 trucks stranded. On the Argentine side,
authorities reported up to 6 feet of snow fell in some places, and
resort owners rejoiced at the prospect of a surge in skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said the storms, affecting
a large portion of central and southern Chile, were among the worst
in 20 years and had left some 39,400 homeless in the interior -- the
rest in or near the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of army conscripts, backed by teams using heavy
equipment, were dispatched Thursday to the hardest-hit
neighborhoods. The soldiers joined civilians in bucket brigades
that cleared water from homes and used shovels to remove mud and
debris from neighborhoods and clogged storm drains.
</P>
<P>
   Army trucks were enlisted to move entire homeless families and
calls went out for donations of roofing materials, bedding,
clothing, canned foods and disinfectants to clean schools inundated
by backed up sewage. Many merchants spent the day clearing away
water and debris outside their shops.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the homeless were placed in a new community of small
homes that was built as government housing, and thrown open to the
public ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Iturra was among the storm victims who pleaded for
government assistance. ''Our mayor must help us, it is his
obligation,'' said Iturra, who said her modest home was already in
bad shape from past rains.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the capital, most schools suspended classes for a
second day Thursday and university students heeded a government
call to take part in an aid campaign for the victims. The
government opened a bank account for donations.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago and the neighboring Pacific port of Valparaiso were
declared disaster zones, which will free $2 million in government
aid. Valparaiso was hit by flooding, while landslides were reported
outside that city.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, some 75 percent of the streets in the capital were
flooded at the storm's height. The Mapocho River, which crosses
through the capital, overflowed its banks, flooding fields outside
the city. Many routes into the capital were closed because of the
water.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Intends To Remain in S. Korea  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- North and South Korea have broken the ice on
their decades-old cold war, but the Pentagon is not warming to the
idea that a unified Korea would neither need nor want U.S. troops
on its soil.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be very clear that we intend to remain a force for
stability in that area as long as we are needed,'' Kenneth Bacon,
spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen, said Thursday. Bacon
said the South Korean government has made clear that it expects
U.S. troops to remain ''for a long time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, we don't envision any change in the U.S. troop
status,'' said P.J. Crowley, spokesman for the National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it appears inevitable that if the North and South take
concrete steps toward reunification, including the conclusion of a
peace treaty, public pressure to bring some U.S. troops home from
Korea will grow.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what will happen almost overnight,'' said Robert
Riscassi, a retired Army general who was commander in chief of U.S.
forces in Korea from 1990-93. ''Clearly there will be a debate.
It's inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 37,000 American troops in South Korea, mainly
soldiers of the Eighth Army, headquartered at Yongsan Army Garrison
in Seoul, and airmen of the 7th Air Force, based at Osan Air base.
The United States has maintained a continuous military presence in
South Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   In comments at the White House, President Clinton called the
summit ''an initial, hopeful step toward peace and reconciliation
in the Korean Peninsula. I welcome the agreements the two leaders
reached on humanitarian and economic cooperation and on a future
summit in Seoul, and hope that both sides will continue down this
promising path.''
</P>
<P>
   The suddenly brighter prospect of a Korean peace also has
sparked speculation that the Pentagon's push to build a national
defense against missile attack could be slowed. That's because the
potential attacker most prominently mentioned by the Pentagon is
North Korea; if the Koreas combined peacefully, the argument for
rushing to build a $60 billion missile defense system could be
seriously undermined.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the administration welcomes diplomatic progress
toward reducing the ballistic missile threat from North Korea, but
he added that a U.S. missile defense system would be useful against
other countries, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''North Korea is not the only country we worry about,'' Bacon
said. ''We worry about Iraq. We worry about Iran, and we worry
about other countries that are working on long-range missiles or
that already have chemical or biological weapons and would like to
have ways to deliver them with long-range missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon acknowledged, however, that the Pentagon's self-imposed
deadline for fielding a missile defense by 2005 is based mainly on
intelligence estimates that North Korea could have a missile
capable of reaching U.S. soil by that time. The CIA has said it
believes Iranian and Iraqi missile threats are farther in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it remains far from clear whether the agreement on
Wednesday by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il to work toward a peaceful reunification of the
divided peninsula will bear fruit. The two sides have been at each
other's throats for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   When the North invaded the South on June 25, 1950, the United
States came to the South's aid and led a United Nations force that
fought against North Korean, Chinese and Russian forces until an
armistice took effect July 27, 1953. No peace treaty was ever
signed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton administration's view, if the threat of a North
Korean attack on the South disappeared there would still be reason
to keep U.S. troops on the peninsula -- as a stabilizing influence
in the greater Asia-Pacific region. That is the same reasoning
behind keeping U.S. troops permanently in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Many South Koreans, however, might not see it that way if their
country were reunified with the North. Already there is a push --
small but sometimes forceful -- among South Korean youth to demand a
U.S. withdrawal. For example, about 2,000 people clashed with riot
police in a village outside of Seoul last week in demanding closure
of Koon-Ni Range, where villagers claim U.S. practice bombs
recently injured six people.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Thursday there already is considerable concern
within the Pentagon that the Korea summit has over-inflated
expectations for peace and prematurely raised the question of
reducing the size of the American military presence in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the matter Wednesday, Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton
said, ''I think that at this point we should wait and see'' what
follows from the summit talks. He warned against an impulse to
''leap to any conclusions'' and said he was not aware that the
future of U.S. troops in Korea was a subject of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, the South Korean president said upon his
return to Seoul that the presence of U.S. troops in the South was
discussed. He did not elaborate but said the exchange was ''very
useful.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Associated Press reported erroneously on
June 12 that universities would be required under a bill passed by
the House to notify parents of the presence on campus of students
or workers convicted of sexual crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill says information on sexual predators should be made

<HEADLINE> Germany, Russia Pledge Closer Ties  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday urged
Germany not to isolate his nation from Europe, emphasizing that
Moscow is eager to cooperate economically and strategically.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to business leaders during his first state visit to
Germany, Putin said he didn't understand why some NATO partners
want to exclude Russia from the alliance when ''NATO is moving
forward to our borders,'' by absorbing former Soviet allies.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is open to cooperation with NATO, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Russia will view it as a provocation if Europe
allows a U.S. missile defense system to be placed in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Russia faces a threat, it goes to destabilize not just
Europe but the entire world,'' he said. ''Some elements (of the
missile defense system) would be stationed in Europe. What should
Russia then think?''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is to decide later this year whether to go
ahead with a proposed missile defense system designed to protect
the United States from nuclear attack by rogue nations or
terrorists. Details on basing the system, with some interceptors
planned for Alaska, would come later.
</P>
<P>
   Economics are Putin's primary concerns in Germany, Europe's
richest nation and Russia's biggest creditor. He hopes during the
two-day visit to win concessions on debts and attract new
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Bilateral ties have been strained in recent years by issues
ranging from the war in Chechnya to NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Germany is the core nation for European integration,'' Putin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting for the first time, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
Putin appeared to have gotten along well, thanks in part to Putin's
familiarity with Germany, where he served for five years as a
Soviet spy during the Cold War. Schroeder said he was impressed
with Putin, describing him as ''knowledgeable and open-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make a truly substantial new beginning in bilateral
relations,'' Schroeder said. ''Germany has an interest in a truly
strategic partnership with Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders continued discussions about Russia's debt during a
private dinner at Schroeder's residence and were taking the topic
up again Friday, although German officials have indicated they
would not forgive the debt outright. Putin also was accompanied by
members of his Cabinet, including the foreign, economic and culture
ministers, who were meeting separately with their counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Germany was Russia's top Western trading partner and biggest
financial backer in the 1990s, supporting the transformation from
communism with some $67 billion in loans, grants, credits and other
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Putin told business leaders Thursday that Russia's historic
economic ties to the former East Germany were not being adequately
utilized, and called on them to take advantage of the new stability
in the Moscow following recent presidential and parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this chance isn't used it would be a great mistake,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 27; Nasdaq Gains 48  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tech stocks came back to life on Wall Street
Thursday as shares of Lucent Technologies jumped on a report that
the company was considering spinning off its microelectronics unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.87 to close at
10,714.82, according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 8.06 to 1,478.60, and the Nasdaq composite index was up
48.23 at 3,845.64.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent was among the most actively traded stocks on the New York
Stock Exchange, rising $2.875 to $59.50 on reports it is
considering plans to spin off its microelectronics unit in a deal
analysts say could be valued at more than $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard shares also rose, gaining $3 to $117 after the
company announced plans to start an online commerce venture in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasm in the tech sector was muted, however, by a steep
dropoff in wireless equipment maker Qualcomm, which fell $9.062 to
$61.438. Chase H&AMP;Q cut its earnings and revenue estimates for
Qualcomm for the fourth quarter and next year. Bear Stearns &AMP; Co.
had cut its outlook for the company a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Financial sector stocks took a hit after Wachovia Corp., a
respected bank company based in North Carolina, warned investors
that its profits would be hurt by the effect of rising interest
rates. Wachovia shares tumbled $13.125 to $57.063.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a bank that people have a lot of respect for, and
that's got the banking stocks down on the day,'' said Charles
White, president and portfolio manager at Avatar Associates, a New
York-based money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   But outside of the specific factors driving tech stocks higher
and financial shares lower, White said the rest of the market was
struggling in the wake of mixed data on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still a market looking for a sense of direction,'' White
said. ''My sense is that it's going to take more convincing news on
the economy before we can see any kind of volume in the market.
With earnings pre-announcement season here, there's even more
uncertainty ladled on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks had waffled earlier in the session as traders digested
data on unemployment benefits claims and industrial production.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve said production at the nation's factories,
mines and utilities rose a bigger-than-expected 0.4 percent in May,
but operating capacity was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Labor Department said 296,000 Americans filed
for unemployment benefits last week, a decline of 16,000.
Economists consider claims below 300,000 an indication of a tight
labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola gained $2.688 to $55.688 after the company said it
reached a tentative deal to settle a race-discrimination lawsuit
from current and former employees. In addition, Salomon Smith
Barney upgraded its shares because efforts to localize the
soft-drink giant's business are beginning to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues barely edged out advancing issues on the NYSE,
where volume came to 988.73 million shares, up from 925.04 million
shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 3.78 at 509.98.

<HEADLINE> Feds Claim To Break Up Heroin Ring  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents made dozens of arrests Thursday
as they broke up a multimillion-dollar Mexican heroin ring alleged
to have smuggled unusually pure and cheap black tar heroin into new
markets from one U.S. coast to the other.
</P>
<P>
   The gang, based in the Nayarit state of Mexico, was distributing
80 pounds of heroin each month, worth more than $7 million, in 22
U.S. cities, said Joe Keefe, chief of special operations for the
Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The ring was marketing the heroin at such a high level of purity
and such a low price that the Mexicans pushed into eastern U.S.
markets formerly served by Colombian drug traffickers, Keefe said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Since Operation Tar Pit began in October in San Diego, DEA and
FBI agents had arrested 70 people through Wednesday. On Thursday,
they were arresting between 170 and 200 more people and searching
60 locations.
</P>
<P>
   The ring used juvenile girls and men in their 60s traveling
alone from its U.S. command center in Los Angeles to carry drugs to
distribution cells from Hawaii to Georgia, Keefe's deputy, Rod
Benson, said in an interview. They each would carry 1 pound or 2
pounds of heroin, either wrapped around them in a concealed
waistband or hidden in the back of a boom box radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time either DEA or the FBI has ever done a
major operation against black tar heroin in the United States. We
learned a lot,'' Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will take a lot of law enforcement cooperation to deal with
this, because a juvenile carrying 1 pound of heroin in a boom box
is a lot harder to detect than the Colombians who move cocaine in
tractor trailer loads,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said DEA was alarmed to find that the ring was selling
$10 street doses of heroin, weighing half a gram, that were 60
percent to 85 percent pure heroin.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Attorney General Janet Reno said, ''This
organization operated in a dangerously efficient manner. Not only
did this group exhibit disregard for the law, but their peddling of
this powerful and addictive drug showed an even greater disregard
for human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Marshall, the DEA administrator, said he believes ''this
operation has some significant implications, not just for law
enforcement but for the country as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This operation, I think, shows that heroin has re-emerged in
our society with a vengeance, and it is more potent and more deadly
in our country than ever before,'' said Marshall, speaking with
Reno at the DEA's suburban Arlington, Va., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the purity of Mexican black tar heroin
had been in the 30 percent to 40 percent range. Colombia heroin,
which is white because it is processed more, is sold in the United
States in purities ranging from 70 percent to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On average, this ring was selling an ounce of heroin for $1,500,
compared with the average of $2,400 that Colombian traffickers are
charging.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Mexicans were underselling the Colombians by $800 to
$1,000 an ounce,'' Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purity rise by the Mexicans over the last few years is
their way of competing with the high purity heroin the Colombians
bring in,'' Keefe said. ''But the Mexicans also have brought the
price down to compete with Colombians in areas east of the
Mississippi River that they were not in before,'' including
Cleveland, Columbus and Steubenville, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said the ring grew its own opium in Nayarit state and
processed it there into black tar heroin, which it smuggled in
vehicles across the Arizona and California borders to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The heroin was kept in stash houses in Los Angeles until the
couriers could carry it to distribution cells around the nation.
Some packages of heroin were shipped by FedEx and United Parcel
Service as well, Benson said. He said the shipping companies were
unwitting tools of the traffickers and had cooperated in the
investigation, which is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   To develop customers quickly, the distribution cells
specifically targeted methadone clinics, where heroin addicts
receive the drug methadone which blocks their need for heroin,
Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence reports indicated the gang corrupted clinic
employees to send heroin addicts to apartments or hotels where they
had established shooting galleries to let the addicts sample and
buy their wares, Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   No clinic employees were among Thursday's arrest targets, Benson
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the gang sold heroin in San Diego, Los Angeles and
Bakersfield, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; Honolulu; Anchorage, Alaska;
Las Vegas and Reno, Nev.; Phoenix and Yuma, Ariz.; Albuquerque,
N.M.; Salt Lake City; Denver; Cleveland, Columbus and Steubenville,
Ohio; Nashville, Tenn; Atlanta; Chicago; Detroit; Pittsburgh; and
Corpus Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The gang also had distribution cells, not linked to one city, in
Kentucky, Minnesota, Alabama, West Virginia and New Jersey, Benson
said.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Assad's Death Creates Chance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- The transfer of power in Syria creates
the potential for substantial regional change, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said, hinting at the possibility of a renewal
of Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This won't be the same Syria,'' Barak said, referring to the
death of Syrian President Hafez Assad and the planned replacement
by his son, Bashar.
</P>
<P>
   If Bashar Assad consolidates his power, he will bring
substantial economic, diplomatic and cultural improvements to
Syria, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak made the comments, his most extensive since Assad's death
Saturday, to an audience of retired defense officials Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   He guardedly praised the late Syrian president as a man of his
word, noting that Israel's border with Syria has been quiet since
Assad signed a cease-fire agreement with Israel following the 1973
Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Hafez Assad was also a cruel, uncompromising enemy
who sponsored ''murderous terror groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he opened peace talks with Israel, however,
''bequeathed to his son and to Syria the legitimacy to talk peace
with Israel. This fact holds hope for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Syrian-Israeli peace talks broke down in January over the scope
of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast War. Syria demands all land taken in the
war; Israel wants to retain a strip of land on the shores of the
Sea of Galilee that lies on the Israeli side of a 1923
international border.
</P>
<P>
   Israel hopes that a deal with Syria will also secure its border
with Lebanon, where Syria is the main power broker.

<HEADLINE> Wife Pleads for Release of Husband  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Choking back tears, the wife of an American
businessman imprisoned in Moscow on espionage charges proclaimed
his innocence Thursday and asked the Russian government to free
him.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Pope said her husband Edmond's arrest has ''torn apart''
their family. She said she recently spent their 30th anniversary
wedding anniversary ''alone, afraid for Ed and wondering whether he
was being hurt, whether he had food and wondering whether he
received the blanket I sent him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pope told a Capitol Hill news conference she plans to fly
to Moscow on Saturday to visit him and meet with Russian officials
to discuss his case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ed did not do anything wrong and does not belong in prison,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pope, who runs CERF Technologies International, a high-tech
consulting firm in State College, Pa., has been in the Lefortovo
Prison since April 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians contend he was seeking plans for a submarine-fired
underwater missile. However, Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., said Pope
only was gathering information about a torpedo that has been
advertised commercially.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ed Pope is no spy. I do not say that lightly,'' said Weldon,
who since taking office in 1987 has dealt extensively with
Russian-American military issues. He is also chairman of the House
Military Research and Development subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon tried to see Pope during a visit to Russia this week, but
was denied a meeting. He criticized President Clinton for not
discussing Pope's case when he met with Russian leader Vladimir
Putin earlier this month.
</P>

   Pope, 53, is a former Navy captain. He worked for three years
with Pennsylvania State University's Applied Research Laboratory,
which does research for the Navy. He left in 1997 to start CERF
Technologies International.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Peterson, R-Pa., whose district includes State
College, criticized the State Department for not pushing the
Russians to release Pope and not keeping Mrs. Pope informed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The State Department has been very ineffective in at least
being able to comfort this woman. The government at least owes to a
family comfort, information and at least some promise of hope,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said, ''This is an
issue that we are concerned about and we're going to raise it as
appropriate with the Russian authorities. I don't know exactly when
we're going to raise it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Embassy did not respond to a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Pope suffers from bone cancer, which currently is in remission.
His wife said she has received no confirmation he is being given
the proper medicine. She also said she had been told that he's lost
25 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said U.S. officials have been told by the Russians that
Pope received food and medicine sent by Pope's family ''although
not as quickly as we and his family would have liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's chief-of-staff, Robert Ferguson, and press secretary,
Jennifer Bennett, will accompany Mrs. Pope to Russia.

<HEADLINE> Reno: Defendants Need Better Access  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defendants who face the death penalty should
have better lawyers and access to genetic and other scientific
tests before they are convicted, Attorney General Janet Reno said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As debate over the death penalty heats up, Reno said, ''There
are too many people in this country who do not have competent
counsel to represent them in capital cases.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People should not be prosecuted for a capital crime until they
have a lawyer who can properly represent them and they have the
investigative and other resources necessary to properly investigate
the charges against them,'' she told her weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a 10-year Columbia University study found that
two-thirds of death sentences nationally are overturned on appeal,
often because of an incompetent defense or an overreaching
prosecution. The likely presidential nominees, Democrat Al Gore and
Republican George Bush, both support the death penalty but have
proposed wider access to DNA testing for the accused or condemned
to minimize the chances of a wrongful execution.
</P>
<P>
   Reno personally opposes the death penalty but has promised to
enforce it as long as it is law. She has authorized federal
prosecutors to seek it 149 times, more than any other attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Two bills in Congress would provide genetic DNA testing for
inmates already on death row. Such genetic testing of evidence
found at crime scenes has on occasion ruled out a defendant as the
culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said those bills don't address the most important problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very important, critically important, that not only do
they have access to DNA testing before they get to the point of
being on death row, but that they have access to other forensic and
investigatory resources that will permit them to properly explore
their claim of innocence,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled the case of James Joseph Richardson which, as a
Florida prosecutor, she delved into as a special assignment from
the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will never forget turning around and looking over my
shoulder at that man who walked out of the courthouse free for the
first time in 21 years, and to think that he could have gone to the
electric chair for a crime I did not think he committed,'' Reno
said. ''We just can't do that. We cannot let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican,
declared a moratorium on the death penalty to examine improvements
because 13 death row inmates in his state have had their
convictions overturned since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   At Reno's request, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder has been
reviewing the fairness of federal penalty procedures. On Aug. 5,
convicted killer Juan Raul Garza is scheduled to become the first
federal prisoner put to death in almost four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Reno did not endorse a national moratorium on the death penalty.
''I think that the states bear a responsibility ... to make sure
that the person being prosecuted has competent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   She said in federal capital cases, each of which she personally
reviews, she has been impressed ''by the quality of the counsel
being appointed by the federal judges. ''

<HEADLINE> CBS Books Its Second 'Survivor'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As the ''Survivor'' audience continues to grow,
CBS has already settled on a second, considerably drier, location
for the sequel: the Australian outback.
</P>
<P>
   The network has begun accepting applications for ''Survivor 2,''
which will be filmed in October and November for broadcast starting
January. CBS expects considerably more than the 6,100 applicants it
received for the first installment.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 23.2 million people watched the third installment
of the 13-week series Wednesday night, a 28 percent increase over
the previous week, Nielsen Media Research said on Thursday. It was
CBS's biggest audience with regular programming for that time slot
since at least 1987.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time ''Survivor'' did not go head-to-head
against ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' But it did compete
against the NBA Finals in about one-fifth of the country, including
Los Angeles and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The soggy stowaways voted out a third person, 27-year-old San
Francisco lawyer Stacey Stillman, sending her away in a torrential
downpour.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged outback won't be nearly as wet as the tropical island
where the series is now set. The sun-baked, desolate territory has
its share of kangaroos, crocodiles, huge spiders and lizards,
however. The filming will take place late in the Australian
springtime.
</P>
<P>
   CBS knew after the first week's ratings that ''Survivor'' would
return, but wanted to make sure the interest built, said CBS
President Leslie Moonves. Casting for the second edition will be
just as important as the location, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The relatability of these people is one of the chords that is
striking people,'' he said. ''Everyone imagines what they would do
because they are seeing people like themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Stillman, appearing Thursday on CBS's ''The Early Show,'' said
she expected she would be voted out because she was the weakest
physically in her group and her personality clashed with some of
her fellow islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did get cranky,'' she said. ''We hadn't eaten in nine
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' last August, ''Survivor''
is enlivening the normally dull summer rerun season. And it's been
a bonanza for CBS's often futile effort to reach a younger
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' alone drew a bigger audience than ABC, NBC, Fox,
UPN and the WB combined Wednesday night among viewers aged 18-34,
Nielsen said. Normally, CBS's typical viewer tops age 50.
</P>
<P>
   That is already affecting the rest of the network, Moonves said.
The Wednesday movie that follows ''Survivor'' has reached a younger
audience over the past three weeks than it has all year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of shows on our schedule that do have a
younger appeal but people don't know to go there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The little-watched CBS ''Early Show,'' where each ''Survivor''
contestant voted out the previous night appears for a Thursday
morning interview, has even benefited. Last week its Thursday
ratings were higher than they'd been since February.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Survivor'' audience is likely to get even bigger, since
next week there won't be an NBA playoff game or ''Millionaire''
edition to compete with.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it still has some room go grow,'' Moonves said.

<HEADLINE> Heidelberger buying part of Kodak's old manufacturing hub  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - The digital division of German printing
giant Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG, which bought Eastman Kodak
Co.'s office-imaging unit last spring, is purchasing a big chunk of
Kodak's Elmgrove industrial hub.
</P>
<P>
   The 770-acre, 17-building manufacturing, office and warehouse
site in the Rochester suburb of Gates was put up for sale last
summer as part of restructuring plan to cut up to 2,500 jobs at the
photography company.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak said Thursday that Heidelberg Digital has agreed to buy
760,000 square feet, or about one-fifth, of the plant for an
undisclosed price. Some 3,100 of the digital division's 24,000
employees work in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak said the agreement will not affect its plan to turn over
the Elmgrove site to Cohen Asset Management Inc., a developer in
Beverly Hills, Calif. Appraisers have estimated that the plant
could fetch between $30 million and $50 million.

</P>
<P>
   The Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company said its second-quarter

margins in lending.
</P>
<P>
International Flavors &AMP; Fragrances Inc., down $2.25 at $32
</P>
<P>
   The maker of aromas and flavors expects to earn about 48 cents a

</P>
<P>
The Coca-Cola Co., up $3.063 at $56.063
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney upgraded the soft-drink maker's shares

In addition, the company said it reached a tentative deal to settle
a race discrimination lawsuit from current and former employees.
However, that settlement came just as the company was saddled with
a separate racial discrimination suit.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Hispanic Students  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton challenged educators and
Congress on Thursday to double the number of Hispanic students who
graduate from college, and again threatened to veto an education
spending bill he said shortchanges his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still a lot of gaps that we all want to close,''
Clinton said at a White House conference on Hispanic education. The
one-day session focused on ways to close long-standing gaps in
academic performance, high school graduation and college attendance
between Hispanic youngsters and their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first step to closing that gap is to believe, as I do,
that high expectations are for all students,'' Clinton said. ''I
believe intelligence is equally distributed throughout the world
but opportunity is not, and the same is true within our own
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The president listed five national goals for Hispanic education
that he said Americans should accomplish over the next decade:
Increase Hispanic participation in early childhood education;
ensure proficiency in English; eliminate the gap in achievement
test scores; increase the rate of high school graduation and
increase the rate of college graduation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House notes Hispanic enrollment in the Head Start
education program for young children has increased by 60,000 since
Clinton took office, and Clinton pointed to other gains he said
prove his approach is working.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, that progress is threatened,'' by the $339.4
billion education, health and labor spending package passed in the
House on Wednesday, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an earlier veto threat by Clinton, Republicans rammed
the huge fiscal 2001 measure through the House by a near party-line
217-214 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Though the bill would boost spending for the Education
Department and many other programs above this year's levels, it
ignores or cuts many Clinton proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that bill were to come to my desk, I would have to veto it
but I hope we can work with Congress on a bipartisan education
bill,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Spitzer: Some stores routinely selling smokes to minors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - An undercover investigation found that some
stores in upstate New York routinely sell cigarettes to minors, and
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said Thursday that proves retailers
and the state aren't doing enough to enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation targeted 11 retail chains that have been
sanctioned in the past for selling tobacco products to people under
18 years old. It found during the past three months that these
stores sold cigarettes to underage teens 47 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results are horrendous,'' Spitzer said. ''There was proven
data that they were violators of the law, but have they changed
their behavior? No.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst violator of the state's Adolescent Tobacco Use
Prevention Act according to the attorney general's investigation,
was Walgreen's which sold to teens in 92 percent of the attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly there's a tremendous diversity in the sincerity with
which retailers are upholding the law,'' Spitzer said, comparing
Walgreen's results to a previous study that found downstate
retailer Waldbaum's selling to teens in only 3 percent of the
attorney general office's attempts.
</P>
<P>
   A call for comment left at Walgreen's corporate headquarters in
Deerfield, Ill., was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The stores targeted by the investigation were: A Plus Mini
Marts, Convenient, Eckerd Drugs, Hannaford Supermarkets, Kinney
Drugs, Mobil Convenience Stores (including Mobil ''On the Run''
Stores), Seven-Eleven, Stewart's, Sunoco, Walgreen's and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   This ''should reinforce the fact that New York state must do
much more to keep cigarettes out of the reach of children,'' said
Elizabeth Miller, CEO of the American Lung Association of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The stores that violated the state's law by selling to minors
are expected to face stiff civil penalties and heavy fines if they
do not make a commitment to curbing teen smoking, Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the attorney general's office unveiled a public
education campaign Thursday that will put more than 31,000 TV spots
on cable stations such as MTV, VH-1, Nickelodeon and ESPN during
peak child and teen viewership hours.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are paid for with $300,000 in funds collected
fines against stores and by matching funds from cable companies as
a public service.

<HEADLINE> Police must kill 436 pound black bear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A black bear's five-hour jaunt through city
streets and parks ended early Thursday when police shot the animal
seven times, killing it.
</P>
<P>
   The 436-pound black bear, estimated to be 3 to 4 years old, was
first spotted about 1:30 a.m. on a city street but quickly slipped
into a wooded area, said police spokesman Det. James Miller. For
the next five hours, police tracked the bear over residential
streets, through parks and commercial areas.
</P>
<P>
   By 5:30 a.m., the city was beginning to wake up and police
worried how the bear would react as people emerged to get their
newspapers, walk their dogs or go to school. They contacted the
state Department of Environmental Conservation to see about
tranquilizing the bear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now an issue that weighed on us is that he was in a heavily
residential area and how dangerous could this situation be for the
general public,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   When the bear approached a person walking a dog then went toward
an officer, the officer shot it twice with a shotgun. The bear took
off, tracked by one of the city's police dogs.
</P>
<P>
   By this point, DEC had notified police the bear was too big to
tranquilize, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Around 6 a.m., police cornered the bear behind a residence and
shot it three more times. The bear bolted across the street where
an officer shot it again. The bear stood up and tore down a section
of stockade fence. A seventh shot finally put the bear down.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate the bear had to be killed but that was far
outweighed by the possibility that the bear could harm someone,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The bear, which had an identification tag that showed it came up
from Pennsylvania, was taken to a state laboratory for a necropsy.

<HEADLINE> Trooper boss chooses former FBI colleague as internal affairs chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A former FBI agent has been chosen to direct
the internal affairs unit of the State Police by trooper
Superintendent Col. Carson J. Dunbar Jr., himself a retired FBI
agent, a State Police spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Dorn Jr. would become the first outsider to head the
unit, which reportedly has upset some troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar told The Trenton Times in Thursday editions that he
picked Dorn because someone not personally acquainted with troopers
under investigation would be better able to review cases fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar was unavailable for comment Thursday, spokesman John
Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorn, a lawyer, retired from the FBI June 2 after a 21-year
career in which he supervised agents combatting foreign spies.
</P>
<P>
   He is to start Monday at the State Police with a captain's
salary of about $83,200, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Lennon, president of the state's largest troopers union, said
Dorn's hiring rankled officers already reeling from two years of
turmoil centered on findings of racial profiling, which included
the sacking of one superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's another smack in the face to sworn members who have been
there, who have come up the ranks and who are capable of doing the
job,'' Lennon told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The State Police has been under scrutiny regarding its treatment
of minorities, both within the ranks and in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Two troopers are awaiting trial on charges of attempted murder
for the wounding of three minority men during a turnpike traffic
stop in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That stop raised questions on whether troopers improperly used
race as a reason to stop motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Reports issued in 1999 by the state Attorney General's Office
documented the practice and also detailed racial discrimination in
hiring and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Dorn will be a civilian, but will fill one of two captain's
slots in the Office of Professional Standards, which has been
expanded to 37 troopers, all with the rank of sergeant or above,
Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorn will oversee the daily management of the office and report
to Maj. Joseph Brennan, who is in charge of the office, Hagerty
said. Brennan will review completed investigations and forward them
to the superintendent for review, hearings and disciplinary
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The office is now based in Freehold. Dunbar has said the central
location would make it easier for members to investigate complaints
and to visit the citizens who file them.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar took over in November from Col. Carl Williams, who was
fired Feb. 28, 1999, after published remarks appeared in which he
linked minorities to drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Dorn is a lifelong New Jersey resident, Dunbar told The Trenton
Times. The superintendent declined to say where he lives.

<HEADLINE> Senior Slump Solution Sought  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Education officials want to fight the
''who-cares syndrome'' plaguing America's high school seniors who
increasingly are showing up late for classes or skipping them
entirely -- even students needing to prepare for college.
</P>
<P>
   ''The senior year is too often a lost opportunity that we need
to reclaim,'' Education Secretary Richard Riley told a conference
of more than 1,400 high school educators Thursday. ''Too many of
our high school graduates are falling off the ladder of success
just when they should be climbing upward.''
</P>
<P>
   A record number of high school graduates are going to college,
department statistics show. But teachers report that high school
seniors accepted into college by December spend the rest of the
year concentrating on getting a summer job or having a great prom.
</P>
<P>
   Students not bound for college also lose interest in earning
good grades as they collect credits needed for graduation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Riley said, one-third of college students require
remedial classes, the college dropout rate stands at 25 percent and
thousands of other students are ill-prepared to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''These young people really do have a serious case of the
'who-cares' syndrome,''' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   The department announced it will put at least $250,000 toward
creating a special panel to study the problem and help teachers and
principals keep students engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit foundations will help cover the cost of members
meeting with students and teachers across the country. The panel
will report its findings to the public and recommend programs for
high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Growing enrollment is focusing more attention than ever on high
schools, educators say. In the next 10 years, an additional 1.3
million students will be in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't do what we did 30 years ago,'' said Kentucky Gov.
Paul Patton, who will direct the group's work. ''We live in a
different world. The opportunities our young people have are
infinitely greater, but the challenges are likewise.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators such as Karen Gray, a high school official from Coos
Bay, Ore., recommended steering high school seniors toward
internships and community service learning.
</P>
<P>
   At Marshfield High School in her town, seniors can earn academic
credits -- for high school and, sometimes, college -- for work they
do on nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not where you go and clean up the beach,'' Gray said.
''It's where you actually learn about beach ecology and then do
something with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley recommended rigorous pre-college courses for seniors. He
also suggested that districts test eighth-graders and that more
states require students to pass a test before earning a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the exit exams, required in 19 states, are an unfair
burden on poor and minority students whose schools have not done a
good job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Years ago, I opposed high stakes exit exams,'' Riley said.
''Today, I believe high school exit exams can help stimulate new
efforts to raise minority achievement if we give every student the
individual support needed to pass the exam.''

<HEADLINE> Bronx DA clears cop in killing of unarmed man  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Bronx district attorney's office has cleared
a narcotics officer who shot an unarmed man in the head only blocks
from where Amadou Diallo was slain. Prosecutors concluded the
killing was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   In an 18-page report issued Thursday, prosecutors said an
''exhaustive investigation'' found no evidence to support criminal
charges against Officer Louis Rivera in the death of Malcolm
Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather, on balance, the evidence supports (Rivera's) statement
that the death of Malcolm Ferguson occurred accidentally, in the
course of a struggle,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera himself ''stated that he has no recollection of pulling
the trigger and was surprised when the gun fired,'' the report
added.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson's parents have contended their son was ''executed''
while he lay face down and helpless in a stairwell, comparing the
incident to the controversial police slayings of two other unarmed
black men - Diallo in February 1999 and Patrick Dorismond a year
later.
</P>
<P>
   Bronx prosecutors charged the four officers who fired 41 bullets
at Diallo with murder; they were acquitted earlier this year. The
Dorismond shooting remains under investigation by Manhattan
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Ferguson family attorney Andrew Miller said the
parents - who have filed a $300 million wrongful death claim
against the city - were ''outraged'' by District Attorney Robert
Johnson's decision not to put the case before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shooting was totally unjustifiable and it is
inconceivable that the shooter will go unpunished in criminal
court,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, 23, was killed March 1 during a confrontation with
plainclothes narcotics officers in a Bronx apartment building
plagued by drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Police alleged that Ferguson - a parolee who was carrying heroin
- was killed after he and other drug suspects were stopped by the
officers. When he broke away and tried to flee, Rivera caught him
in the stairwell. A struggle ensued and the officer's 9 mm Smith &AMP;
Wesson discharged once, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from Johnson's office said they found civilian
witnesses who confirmed Rivera's claims that he had identified
himself as a police officer and that during the struggle he
implored, ''Stop resisting. Why are you resisting?''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera described both men tumbling to the ground as he grabbed
Ferguson's shoulder with his left hand and drew his gun with his
right. Amid the scuffle, he tried ''to improve his grip on the
gun,'' which ''may have caused his index finger to slip and make
contact with the trigger,'' he told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus of civilian and police witnesses said that Rivera
emerged from the building saying, ''I shot him. Call a boss and a
bus'' - police parlance for a supervisor and an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   The report also concluded that there was no forensic or medical
evidence to support accusations by Ferguson's family that he was
shot while his head was pressed against a hard surface.

<HEADLINE> Ex-KGB Officer's Book Is Evidence  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY HOBBS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Six years before George Trofimoff was arrested as a
suspected Soviet agent, an ex-KGB spymaster wrote of an operative
whose work closely matches accusations against the retired U.S.
intelligence officer.
</P>
<P>
   In the book ''The First Directorate,'' Oleg Kalugin described a
German-born American recruited to spy for Moscow during most of the
Cold War years.
</P>
<P>
   Kalugin, former chief of counterintelligence for the former
Soviet secret police and intelligence agency, said a Russian priest
was used to obtain the services of a top U.S. officer based in West
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the agent's motives to hand over secret documents to
the Soviets were ''strictly financial.''
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff was not mentioned by name in the 1994 book, but those
details run parallel to those released Wednesday by the U.S.
government following the retired Army colonel's arrest in Florida
on espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Germany of Russian emigre parents, and worked in
Nuremberg as U.S. chief of an interrogation center where
Soviet-bloc defectors were questioned to get military information.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said Trofimoff, alleged to have worked for
Moscow from 1969 to 1994, is the highest ranking U.S. military
officer ever charged with spying.
</P>
<P>
   A federal law-enforcement officer in Washington, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Kalugin wrote about the Trofimoff spy
case in the book, but left out the names. Kalugin didn't return a
message left for him Thursday at his home in suburban Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter titled ''The Spy Game,'' Kalugin wrote about
recruiting Americans and others as spies, and meeting them often in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was also in Vienna that I met another valuable American
source -- this one from U.S. Military Intelligence. The man was a
high-ranking officer stationed with American forces in West
Germany, and we successfully recruited him after one of our
informers in Germany told us the officer might be open to a KGB
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''On several occasions I traveled to Vienna to meet the
American, who handed us classified documents that contained, among
other things, battle plans for NATO forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The American was paid $5,000 each time he passed something
along.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I know, the intelligence officer was never caught by
the Americans,'' Kalugin wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's federal indictment in Tampa said Trofimoff passed
along large quantities of secret information, including documents
produced by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and plans
detailing what the West knew of Soviet and Warsaw Pact military
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Kalugin's book said the American's recruitment was initiated by
a friend who was a Russian Orthodox priest.
</P>
<P>
   That detail lines up with the indictment, which said Trofimoff
was recruited by a priest, Igor Vladimirovich Susemihl, son of
Russian parents who grew up with Trofimoff in Germany and remained
close to him as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Susemihl died in 1999 after rising to become the highest Russian
Orthodox official in Austria, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The priest's help in spotting a potential recruit is precisely
the reason we in the KGB wanted agents inside the church,'' wrote
Kalugin.

<HEADLINE> NATO Searches for Weapons in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By MEMLI KRASNIQI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Concerned over an increase in armed
attacks in Kosovo, NATO peacekeepers launched a major raid Thursday
in an ethnic Albanian stronghold, seizing a large quantity of
weapons and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The operation followed the killing of two Serbs and wounding of
another Thursday after their vehicle ran over a land mine on a road
south of Pristina used almost exclusively by the Serbs to avoid
Albanian villages.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a certain plan to destabilize Kosovo,'' said the chief
U.N. administrator, Bernard Kouchner, who visited the site along
with senior NATO commanders and ethnic Albanian politicians. ''They
do not want us to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian leader Hashim Thaci said the incident ''will
make even more difficult the already unstable situation in
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   To curb such attacks, about 400 British and other troops began a
house-to-house search at dawn Thursday in a roughly 60-square-mile
area in the Drenica region.
</P>
<P>
   Drenica, west of the capital Pristina, was the heartland of the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army which fought the Serbs until
last year's NATO intervention and the subsequent peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In one village peacekeepers found a large cache of homemade
shotguns, rifles, hand grenades and ammunition. The weapons were
confiscated, but no arrests were made, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reasons to believe there are large numbers of weapons
in the area and our task is to find them as quickly as we can,''
said Lt. Col. David Allfrey, a spokesman for the British forces.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers from Finland and Norway, also participated in the
search, while troops from the Czech Republic secured the roads
around the area, carefully searching all vehicles for hidden
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The search will continue for several days until all the ground
is covered, Allfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Albanians cooperated with the peacekeepers, he said, but
many wanted similar actions in Serb villages.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, 15 people, two Serbs and 13 ethnic Albanians, were
detained Wednesday after a raid in Pristina. U.N. police found 50
illegal Yugoslav passports, according to police spokesman Inspector
Gilles Moreau.

<HEADLINE> Court: Offender entitled to sex registry hearing  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A man was entitled to a hearing before being
classified as a sexually violent predator under the state's
sex-offender registry, New York's highest court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The sex offender's right to due process under both the state and
federal constitutions was violated in the case, the state Court of
Appeals decided in a 7-0 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The decision continues the process by state courts of
interpreting New York's version of ''Megan's Law.'' The 1996
statute set up a mandatory registry for convicted sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling Thursday in another case involving a sex offender, the
Court of Appeals said a man who pleaded guilty to an August 1995
sex offense in the Bronx is not entitled to court review of his
classification in the registry.
</P>
<P>
   Those judged to be at the highest risk of committing another sex
crime upon their release from prison or jail - so-called Level 3
offenders in the registry - face reporting requirements with
authorities, the release of their names, pictures and addresses to
the public and other steps designed to alert the community to their
presence.
</P>
<P>
   A man identified in court papers only as ''David W.'' was
sentenced to one year in jail for refusing to sign a registration
form which classified him as a Level 3 offender.
</P>
<P>
   David W., of Southampton in Suffolk County, was convicted in
1995 of sodomizing and sexually abusing two boys. He argued that
since his crimes were committed before the state's sex registry was
set up, he was being denied his constitutional due process rights
by the way he was classified.
</P>
<P>
   Those convicted after 1996 are assigned risk classifications by
judges and have a right to be heard on those decisions at that
time. But sex offenders prior to 1996 who had served time and been
released get classified by parole or probation officers without a
hearing. David W.'s lawyers argued that is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals agreed Thursday. The way David W. was
classified, the judges said, ''did not provide defendant with any
meaningful way to voice his objections.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Due process requires that the state bear the burden of
proving, at some meaningful time, that a defendant deserves the
classification assigned,'' the court said in a decision written by
Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick. ''Here, the state did not bear the
burden of proof at any proceeding before a neutral fact finder.''
</P>
<P>
   William Ferris, an assistant district attorney for Suffolk
County, said Thursday's ruling is ''narrowly framed'' and will have
a ''limited'' effect in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''This change and other recent legislative amendments to the
(Megan's Law) statute will give police and prosecutors clear
constitutional guidelines to track all violent sexual predators in
the future,'' Ferris said.
</P>
<P>
   David W.'s lawyer Charles Newell did not return a telephone call
for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the other Megan's Law-related case, the court rejected the
contention of Ian Kearns that he had the right to challenge his
classification as a Level 3 offender after he pleaded guilty to a
sexual abuse charge involving a 16-year-old girl in the Bronx in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The court noted that the state Legislature has amended Megan's
Law to provide for appeals of classification rulings made after
Jan. 1, 2000. But the judges declined to extend that privilege
retroactively to cases like Kearns'.
</P>
<P>
   In another ruling Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   -The Court of Appeals said it has decided against hearing a
challenge to New York City's policy of seizing the vehicles of
drivers caught driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Civil Liberties Union had filed the suit on behalf
of Pavel Grinberg, a 28-year-old Staten Island man whose 1988 Acura
was seized by authorities when he was allegedly caught driving
while drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Two lower courts affirmed that the city's application of a
56-year-old seizure ordinance to DWI cases is legal.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals did not detail why it was refusing to hear
the Grinberg case.

<HEADLINE> GOP Seeks New Disclosure Rules  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several congressional Republicans proposed
legislation Thursday to bring labor unions and business groups
under the same financial disclosure rules as the Senate recently
approved for a growing number of secretive groups seeking to sway
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public has the right to know the identity of those trying
to influence our elections,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon as
he and some fellow GOP senators previewed their plan to require
disclosure of donors and expenditures for political activity.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was greeted warily by supporters of comprehensive
campaign finance overhaul legislation, some of whom noted that
Smith and his group consistently opposed their legislation to curb
the influence of money in campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   An aide said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was ''cautiously
interested and exploring details.'' Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis.,
noted that Smith and his group had effectively reversed course from
last week, when they opposed a disclosure proposal in a Senate
vote. Still, he said, ''We want to make sure they don't love it to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   The developments came as both houses moved toward votes on
disclosure legislation, the remnants of a broader, failed effort to
reduce the role of money in campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Feingold and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., won a
surprise victory last week in the Senate when they succeeded in
winning approval for a proposal to impose disclosure requirements
on a secretive group of organizations. These groups, known as 527s
for the section of the tax code that governs them, have become more
prominent in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Within a day of the Senate vote, moderate Republicans in the
House won a promise from their leadership that the issue would be
brought to the floor by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and others challenged
Democrats to support their effort to bring unions under greater
disclosure rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime on the floor of the Senate anything affects labor
unions, Democrats say it is a poison pill,'' said McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would apply to unions and business groups such as
the Chamber of Commerce. It would not require disclosure of
memberships lists, but would mandate public disclosure of anyone
donating $200 or more to political activity, as well as spending in
excess of $500.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would not affect diverse other groups which engage
in political activity, ranging from the National Right to Life
Committee to the American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell told reporters he believes the proposal is of dubious
constitutionality and he expects a court test if it is approved.

<HEADLINE> Sentence in Auschwitz Case Cut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- A Polish court on Thursday wiped out the
sentence of a Roman Catholic leader convicted of inciting hatred of
Jews by urging people to erect crosses outside the former Nazi
death camp at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling on an appeal by Kazimierz Switon, the provincial court in
southern Bielsko-Biala upheld his conviction but reduced a
six-month suspended prison term imposed in January to a fine of
$313, court spokesman Jaroslaw Sablik said.
</P>
<P>
   The court then forgave the fine, saying Switon paid more than
its equivalent when he unnecessarily spent one month in prison in
1999 on other charges that were never confirmed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Switon, who said last month he wants to run for president this
fall, was initially convicted by a regional court in Oswiecim, the
site of the Auschwitz museum.
</P>
<P>
   Switon was charged after residents complained about statements
he made at the site in 1998, where followers erected more than 300
crosses surrounding a large cross used as a backdrop for a 1979
papal mass at nearby Birkenau.
</P>
<P>
   The action was taken to prevent removal of the papal cross,
placed at the site near Auschwitz in 1988 and visible from inside
the camp. The presence of the cross drew protests from
international Jewish groups and the Israeli government for
insulting the memory of Jews killed at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Urging followers to put up crosses, Switon said in leaflets
''the time has come for us Poles to wage merciless war on
Jewish-communist-masonry, the biggest enemies of the Polish
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The government had army troops remove the crosses in May 1999,
right before John Paul II made his eighth pilgrimage to his
homeland. The larger cross remained.

<HEADLINE> Senate votes to name new rail station after retiring Lautenberg  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate voted Thursday to honor retiring
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., in a manner reflecting one of his
political passions: public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with a unanimous voice, the Senate approved a proposal
to attach Lautenberg's name to the Secaucus Transfer Station, a
transit hub under construction in Hudson County.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the proposal is approved by the House, the station will
be called the Frank R. Lautenberg Transfer Station.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, who is leaving the Senate at the end of the year
after three terms, is a longtime advocate of mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to see Senator Lautenberg honored in an
appropriate way as he departs his service to the Senate and to the
nation's transportation system,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
as he proposed to name the station after his colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby is chairman of the Senate Transportation Appropriations
Subcommittee. Lautenberg is the highest-ranking Democrat on the
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Several people in Washington and New Jersey said Thursday that
Shelby initially tossed out a much more dramatic idea: renaming
Newark International Airport after Lautenberg. But that idea did
not go far.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by his office, Lautenberg said he was
''truly surprised and humbled'' that Shelby even proposed naming
the airport after him.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg said the Secaucus transfer station ''will mean more
comfortable, more efficient travel for thousands of state
residents.''
</P>
<P>
   The transfer station is slated to open in May 2002, and is being
financed by federal funds. In 1994, the Federal Transit
Administration pledged to provide full funding for the project,
which carried an estimated price tag of $444 million.
</P>
<P>
   The station will provide a central connection point, for the
first time, for most of New Jersey's rail lines. Lautenberg's
office said the station will cut commuting times for an estimated
2,700 rail riders by an average of 15 minutes per trip.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to name the station for Lautenberg was adopted as
an amendment to the Senate's fiscal year 2001 transportation
spending bill. The Senate endorsed the amendment by voice vote
shortly before voting, 99-0, to approve the overall bill.
</P>
<P>
   During the brief debate over the amendment, Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., called Lautenberg ''an extraordinary champion for public
transportation (and) for aviation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy to champion the rail system in a country that
has been so dominated by automobiles,'' Kerry said. ''For all his
years here, Frank Lautenberg has been the single strongest advocate
in making certain we have an alternative form of transportation.''

<HEADLINE> Nader: Cut Benefits To Mortgage Cos  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ralph Nader, warning of a potential taxpayer
bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis, urged lawmakers to
cut government benefits to mortgage-market giants Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac -- which he called ''poster children for corporate
welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers said Thursday that acting hastily could raise
the cost of buying a home by increasing borrowing costs for Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, which are called government-sponsored
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Nader in criticizing the two mortgage companies at a
House subcommittee hearing was the head of the National Community
Reinvestment Coalition. Officials of the National Taxpayers Union,
Citizens Against Government Waste and the Competitive Enterprise
Institute made criticisms in written testimony they submitted.
</P>
<P>
   They added to recent criticism from lawmakers and regulators
against the two publicly traded companies, which Congress created
to buy home loans from banks and other lenders to supply ready cash
to the mortgage market.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics believe there is an inherent conflict between the
companies' government mandate and their duty to their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ''For too long, the Congress has played the role of an indulgent
parent to'' Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which ''have long since
grown beyond adolescence,'' Nader testified. ''It is time for (the
two companies) to give up ties to the federal government that have
made them poster children for corporate welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, taking a break from campaign as the Green Party's
presidential candidate, warned that an S&AMP;L-style bailout, costing
taxpayers billions, could occur if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were
to collapse in rougher economic times.
</P>
<P>
   David Jeffers, a spokesman for Fannie Mae, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that Fannie Mae is one of the best managers of risk
in the world,'' he said in a telephone interview after the hearing.
''There are a variety of advantages and benefits that Fannie Mae
has ... that demonstrate the partnership between Congress and
Fannie Mae.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Freddie Mac had no immediate comment on the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Nader endorsed a bill proposed by Rep. Richard Baker, R-La.,
chairman of the House Banking subcommittee on capital markets,
securities and government-sponsored enterprises, that would strip
away some of the companies' key benefits, such as their ability to
borrow directly from the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania, the subcommittee's
senior Democrat, cautioned: ''We must ... ensure that we do not
accidentally raise homeownership costs. ... We should not move
precipitously.''
</P>
<P>
   John Taylor, president and CEO of the National Community
Reinvestment Coalition, said his group had found that Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac lag behind banks in the percentage of home
mortgages they finance that go to members of minorities and
low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   He said access to a never-used, emergency $2.25 billion line of
credit at the Treasury Department should come with a condition that
they meet their goals for making affordable housing available.
</P>
<P>
   In March, officials of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development said figures showed that Fannie Mae's policies have
increased costs and may have reduced the availability of home
mortgages for blacks.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense Work Can Begin  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Administration lawyers have concluded that the
Pentagon can break ground in Alaska on a powerful radar for a
missile defense system without violating an arms control treaty
that prohibits national missile defenses, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The radar, which would be built on the remote island of Shemya
if President Clinton gives the go-ahead, is a critical link in a
proposed missile defense system designed to protect all 50 U.S.
states against attack by a small number of ballistic missiles. The
administration is aiming to complete the project by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The question of violating the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty
is important because the administration has said it wants to
preserve the treaty by adopting amendments permitting a limited
missile defense. Russia, however, is resisting and is likely to
assert that any construction work amounts to a treaty violation.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported Thursday that administration lawyers
have set out three legal interpretations of how far the Pentagon
could go on the Alaska construction without violating the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials who confirmed the Times report on
condition they not be identified said the first interpretation
would allow contractors to pour a concrete pad for the radar on
Shemya without violating the treaty. Other, less restrictive
interpretations are that even more construction could be done.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not decided which, if any, of the legal
interpretations to accept, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration lawyers have offered their advice on
initial work that could be done within the legal bounds of the ABM
treaty, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said they have not
determined the exact point in the construction process at which the
United States would be in violation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It remains our goal first and foremost to try to develop a
(missile defense) capability within the bounds of the ABM treaty,''
Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said he could not discuss specifics of the
administration's legal interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you that lawyers have analyzed deployment
timetables and they have analyzed the construction requirements for
the radar in the Aleutians on Shemya Island,'' Bacon said. ''They
have come up with a number of options, and the president, at the
appropriate time, will review their legal analysis and their
options and make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The radar would help point U.S. missile interceptors -- likely to
be based near Fairbanks, Alaska -- in the right direction as they
race toward space to collide with the warhead of an incoming
ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has estimated that construction on the radar must
begin next spring if the 2005 deadline for completing the project
is to be met. If Clinton were to decide that he wanted to keep that
target deadline -- but were operating under an assumption that
construction could not begin without violating the treaty -- then he
would have to decide on abrogating the ABM treaty before he leaves
office. That is because the ABM treaty requires a six-month advance
notification before withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen has said he intends to make his
recommendation to Clinton in August whether to proceed with the
initial construction work.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Awarded Naval Contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy announced Thursday it signed a $8.9
billion contract with Boeing Co. for production of 222 F/A-18 Super
Hornet fighter aircraft, its new version of the existing F/A-18
Hornet.
</P>
<P>
   The work is to be done over a five-year period at Boeing plants
in St. Louis and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Although some members of Congress have criticized the Super
Hornet program as an inefficient way of giving the Navy and Marine
Corps a more modern fighter aircraft, Navy leaders insist it is
vital to their future.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will provide twice the sorties, a third the combat losses
and 40 percent greater range,'' said Adm. Jay Johnson, the chief of
naval operations. ''We can't wait to get it to the fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   Strike Fighter Squadron 115 from Naval Air Station Lemoore,
Calif., is scheduled to be the first squadron with operational
Super Hornets. It is scheduled to make its first deployment with
Super Hornets in June 2002 aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln.

<HEADLINE> Document Cites Korean War Killings  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   A captured North Korean document claiming U.S. soldiers shot and
killed South Korean refugees was turned over to the American high
command almost immediately after the incident in the early days of
the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean document, dated Aug. 2, 1950, and translated by
the U.S. Army within a few weeks of its capture, used its
description of the events to whip up sentiment against U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   The document was obtained by The Associated Press and is being
studied by Pentagon officials investigating allegations of the
attack on civilians at No Gun Ri in late July, 1950, according to a
source familiar with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At least 41 copies were made of one of the translations at the
time, and, according to its distribution list, were sent to all
three branches of the military as well as the Army's assistant
chief of staff for intelligence in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The captured document was a report to commanders urging that
North Korean propaganda officers make sure that all communist
soldiers in the field knew about the alleged American actions. The
document was contained in one of 20 bulletins of captured documents
circulated to U.S. military commanders in July and August 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The captured document identified the site of the killing as a
tunnel near Yongdong, which is eight miles from No Gun Ri. North
Korean newspaper reports from the time, containing similar details
to those in the captured document, named No Gun Ri as the site of
the killings.
</P>
<P>
   AP was unable to learn whether the allegations in the captured
document were ever investigated by U.S. authorities. At the time,
the American military was in a chaotic retreat from communist
forces; the document itself contained language that may have been
dismissed as propaganda; and U.S. investigators had orders to focus
on atrocities committed by North Koreans against U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon investigators launched an inquiry into the events at No
Gun Ri after AP reported on the killings last year. The source
close to the U.S. investigation said the document is significant
because it is the first evidence that the U.S. high command
received an account of a mass killing in the vicinity of No Gun Ri
shortly after it allegedly happened.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Maj. Tom Collins said he would not discuss the
document, nor any aspect of the investigation, until the inquiry is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, a source close to a separate investigation of No Gun
Ri, by the South Korean government, said investigators there had
also obtained the North Korean document.
</P>
<P>
   AP's original report cited dozens of ex-GIs and South Korean
survivors as saying a 1st Cavalry Division unit killed a large
number of civilian refugees in and around a railroad trestle's
underpasses at No Gun Ri, 100 miles southeast of Seoul, the South
Korean capital, between July 26 and July 28, 1950. Korean survivors
estimated 300 civilians were killed while ex-GIs estimated 100, 200
or hundreds died. About 100 refugees died in a strafing by U.S.
warplanes that preceded the shootings, survivors said.
</P>
<P>
   AP obtained two translations of the North Korean document. One,
which went to the U.S. Army's Far East Command as well as the Army
in Washington, says 2,000 Koreans were killed in the tunnel. The
other translation, which went to the 1st Cavalry Division
headquarters in Korea, says 100 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The original document in Korean was not attached to the
translations found in the U.S. National Archives, and it could not
be determined if the discrepancy in numbers was based on a
mistranslation.
</P>
<P>
   The AP's research in the U.S. National Archives and elsewhere
has found no specific mention of No Gun Ri in U.S. military
reports, nor any sign that an investigation was conducted at the
time. The captured North Korean document does not mention No Gun Ri
by name, but the location -- near Yongdong -- and details of the
killings match the No Gun Ri circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the document refers to bodies in a ''tunnel.''
South Korean survivors have shown investigators the tunnel where
they say the shooting occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the survivors have also described hiding under the
dead to escape the bullets. The document echoes their account:
</P>
<P>
   ''There were approximately 10 persons who had lain under the
dead for four or five days and were finally able to escape. Those
10 escapees, with tears in their eyes, asked us to get revenge for
their treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The document, titled ''Cultivation of Hatred to Obtain
Revenge,'' also speaks of another killing, of an unknown number of
civilians, in a railroad tunnel in the town of Yongdong. Those
refugees were strafed by planes during the day and shelled by
artillery at night, it said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the document alleges the enemy'' had ''executed'' 11,148
civilians in a dozen locations.
</P>
<P>
   The captured communication was signed by two North Korean
officers and urged ''all units'' to use the information for
propaganda and to inform their soldiers that the Americans ''are
performing the barbaric act of killing civilians.'' This would
''cause the soldiers to feel that it is their duty to fight and
liberate their people, and by this means to stir up hatred for the
enemy and completely destroy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean army report was seized by a 1st Cavalry
Division unit on Aug. 15, 1950, 17 days after division troops
pulled back from No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. translator's note on the back of one translation said the
documents were a ''reflection upon the poor morale throughout the
NK (North Korean) Command and also the fact that they are
experiencing difficulty in controlling their men.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1st Cavalry Division's information officer from those days,
retired Col. Harold D. Steward of San Diego, said he does not
remember that particular captured document, but he said such a
document would have been distributed to senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something like that would have gone to the division general
staff and probably major unit commanders, and would have been part
of the daily intelligence briefing for Gen. Gay,'' he said. The
general staff of colonels and majors oversaw the division's
operations. Maj. Gen. Hobart R. Gay, who died in 1983, was the
division commander.
</P>
<P>
   Five copies of one translation were sent to the intelligence
section at the 8th Army, headquarters for the entire warfront,
according to notations on one of the translations.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing what the North Korean report said, a division
intelligence officer from those days told the AP such a report
should have prompted an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to me an inquiry would be made, probably by the
inspector general, or they would have called on us,'' retired Col.
Louis B. Trevathan of Santa Fe, N.M., said, referring to his
counterintelligence unit within the division's ''G-2'' intelligence
section.
</P>
<P>
   Trevathan said he does not remember being asked to deal with
such a document.
</P>
<P>
   He also said some division officers might have viewed the
information as unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   ''At that time there was so much confusion and lack of
reinforcements and this sort of thing that we were hanging on by
our fingernails at best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector-general reports for August 1950 show that 1st Cavalry
Division investigators were involved in other issues, such as the
allegations that North Korean soldiers had killed about 36 American
prisoners of war in a single incident.
</P>
<P>
   Several North Korean journalists advancing with their army filed
reports about American shootings of refugees at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   In one, dated Aug. 19, 1950, reporter Chun Wook of the Cho Sun
In Min Bo newspaper wrote that North Korean troops moving into the
No Gun Ri area ''were encountered with indescribably gruesome
scenes under the railway tunnels and in nearby fields. ... About
400 bodies of old and young people and children covered the scene
so that it was difficult to walk around without stepping on
corpses.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Sunjoo Pang, a South Korean historian who is
researching No Gun Ri for a magazine and who is an expert on
captured North Korean documents, cites four North Korean news
reports and other documents that refer to killings at a tunnel near
Yongdong, all similar in detail to the captured document.

<HEADLINE> Report: Funds Split Unfairly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fourteen states and the District of Columbia
get 80 percent of the money the federal government spends on
research and development, according to a White House report
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal research and development totals about $80 billion
annually spent by 24 different government agencies. Every state,
plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, gets something.
</P>
<P>
   California is by far the leader among states, with a research
take of $14.4 billion. Much of that money goes to universities and
other institutions involved in high technology and biomedical
research.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only by supporting research where the returns are not
guaranteed can we ensure the steady, gradual progress that
underpins front-page news stories that accompany each new
success,'' said White House science adviser Neal Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taking a risk on open-ended research, whose cost-effectiveness
is often difficult to guarantee, sometimes generates the greatest
economic returns,'' Lane said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   The top recipients of research dollars are: California;
Maryland; Virginia; Georgia; Texas; Massachusetts; Florida; New
York; Ohio; the District of Columbia; Alabama; Pennsylvania; New
Mexico; New Jersey and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared by a federally funded research and
development center within the RAND Corp.

<HEADLINE> AMA Passes Reproductive Measure  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Under the watchful eye of the Roman Catholic
church, the American Medical Association steered a cautious path
Thursday through the minefield of pregnancy prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA passed a measure aimed at ensuring patient access to
reproductive services, including tubal ligation and vasectomy, when
church-owned hospitals merge with or acquire other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But as the nation's largest doctors group closed its annual
meeting, members also affirmed a policy that physicians should not
be forced to do anything that violates their moral principles.
</P>
<P>
   The 247-184 vote by the AMA's House of Delegates followed
testimony and heated debate this week. Among those testifying was
Cardinal Francis George, head of the Chicago archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   The pregnancy prevention measure was a softened version of a
resolution drafted by the AMA's California delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation was motivated by concern that hospital
acquisitions by Catholic health-care networks have deprived some
communities of pregnancy prevention facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said the first resolution would have forced
Catholic hospitals to provide pregnancy services in violation of
church doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Nora O'Callaghan, a spokeswoman for the Chicago archdiocese,
said Catholics' main concern with the first measure ''was the idea
that there was going to be a coercive attempt to force Catholic
hospitals to violate their Catholic teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The California delegation helped amend the resolution after an
AMA committee recommended that it be softened.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to give patients access and still respect the
individual moral teachings of all concerned,'' said Dr. Delmar
Tonge, the delegation's chairman, after Thursday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Tonge said the AMA will now work with Catholic hospitals to help
steer patients to facilities that offer reproductive services when
there are mergers in their community.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Health Association, which represents more than
2,000 not-for-profit Catholic health-care systems nationwide,
called Thursday's vote a victory.
</P>
<P>
   The vote upheld patients' and doctors' constitutional rights to
religious freedom, the association said.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, the AMA agreed to oppose psychiatric therapies
that assume homosexuality is a mental disorder and therapists who
suggest patients change their sexual orientation.

<HEADLINE> Albright Headed Back to Middle East  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
return to the Mideast East in about 10 days for another attempt at
turning Israeli-Palestinian discord into settlement by
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will ''assess whether a summit would be useful at this
point or whether more work needs to be done,'' State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday. The decision by President
Clinton to dispatch Albright underscores his push for a deal in his
final months in office.
</P>
<P>
   Slow-moving negotiations between the two sides in Washington
will continue for a few more days before U.S. mediator Dennis B.
Ross travels to the Middle East, ahead of Albright, said Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   Already twice this month, Albright has visited the Middle East --
for talks with Barak and Arafat, and for Syrian President Hafez
Assad's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, after meeting Thursday with
Clinton at the White House, lashed out at Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, whom he once described as his peace partner. The
Israeli ''lacks the desire to work with us in order to achieve a
comprehensive peace in the region,'' Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat sought Clinton's help in achieving his goals, foremost of
which is a state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
   A top Arafat aide, Nabil Abourdeneh, said talk of a three-way
summit was premature. ''The gap between the two positions is still
wide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy fired back
at the Palestinians, saying their goal is ''to arrive at a point
where these talks will not produce any results.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations in Washington have sputtered, partly broken off by
the Palestinians to protest Israel's refusal to release 250
prisoners and to agree to Arafat's terms for an Israeli pullback
this month on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is prepared to declare statehood without Israel's
approval if a settlement is not concluded by Sept. 13, the deadline
the two sides have set.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration expressed tepid support for Barak,
whose willingness to yield territory on all fronts to the Arabs
contrasts with the hard line stance of his predecessor, Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we are satisfied that both leaders are very serious in
their efforts to reach an agreement,'' said P.J. Crowley, spokesman
for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Added Boucher, ''Both remain committed to achieving a peace
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton kept his distance from the rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are going to make peace we are going to have to deal
with the difficult issues,'' he said before meeting Arafat. ''The
less we say now about it, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks resumed Tuesday, after a two-week break, at two
Washington-area Air Force bases. They immediately drifted into
disagreement
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I should characterize what is going on,''
Clinton said. ''The only thing I can tell you is I want to finish
the job, and I'd like to see it finished on time.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Arafat praised Clinton for trying to keep
negotiations alive ''at this difficult time and in the face of the
obstacles we're facing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton last year expressed support for Palestinian
''aspirations'' during a trip to Gaza. But NSC spokesman Crowley
dismissed any suggestion the president would prod Israel or the
Palestinians to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not in the position to pressure them,'' Crowley said.
''They understand that time is not on their side. ... I don't think
we have any quarrel with the firmness by which the leaders and
their negotiating teams are working hard to see what can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   A settlement is Clinton's highest foreign policy priority before
he leaves office in January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with Barak by telephone for 40 minutes Wednesday
and said the two sides were not ready for a Camp David-style
three-way meeting with him. Albright called Barak on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we need to get the parties a little closer before we
can go there,'' Clinton said. ''We don't have a lot of time. We're
down to all the hard issues now, and we're working on it. I'm
hopeful, but I don't want to hold out false hopes.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (AP) -- A Marine Corps helicopter crash
off San Diego that killed seven men was caused primarily by crew
mistakes while approaching a Navy ship, military officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The helicopter simply came in too low and too fast,'' Marine
Lt. Col. Carol McBride said in announcing results of an
investigation into the Dec. 9 accident.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Capt. James Lukehart, had more than 1,650 hours of
flight time and was not considered a ''hot-dog'' pilot, according
to a 29-page report.
</P>
<P>
   Six Marines and a Navy corpsman died and 11 others were rescued
after the rear landing gear of their CH-46E Sea Knight helicopter
snagged a safety net during a training exercise and plunged into
the sea 15 miles off Point Loma.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps plans to change its training and equipment
based on the report's findings, but McBride stressed that military
exercises are ''inherently dangerous.''

<HEADLINE> A Fast, Unfeeling 'Macbeth'  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Lady Macbeth isn't the only one sleepwalking on
stage at Broadway's Music Box Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Macbeth, in the person of television star Kelsey Grammer, seems
to be in a bit of a trance himself. But then, this misguided
revival of Shakespeare's great study of evil would induce
drowsiness in just about anyone, even its actors.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the producers have not spent a fortune on
lighting. This is the dimmest, darkest ''Macbeth'' in quite a
while, a minimalist rendition that seems to be painted entirely in
black and with its actors dressed in dark duds, too. Trendy, but
hard to see.
</P>
<P>
   For another, Grammer, best known from TV's ''Frasier'' and the
prime mover behind this production, is a curiously muted villain.
His detached demeanor gives the show a feeling of a recital, not a
full-fledged retelling of a bloody struggle for the Scottish crown.
</P>
<P>
   The production, which opened Thursday for a limited run through
July 30, flounders with him. A bearded Grammer doesn't get the
ambition and anguish that haunt this most possessed of
Shakespeare's title characters. He stands back, almost stepping
outside the play as the story of Macbeth's bloody rise to power
swiftly unfolds. The horror that should permeate the evening is
only perfunctorily portrayed, even in the murders of Macduff's wife
and children, one of the tragedy's more terrifying moments.
</P>
<P>
   Director Terry Hands doesn't offer much help. ''Macbeth'' is
Shakespeare's shortest play, but this cast races through it so fast
they should be wearing sneakers. It's a quick evening, two hours
and no intermission, which is wise, considering the end results.
</P>
<P>
   Hands has made some odd directorial choices. The banquet scene
with Banquo's ghost, one of the drama's more potent moments,
fizzles because the spirit never materializes. Here, Macbeth
shrieks at an empty chair. Less is definitely less.
</P>
<P>
   The three witches are of the bag-lady variety, loud yet often
unintelligible. They open the drama as if they are scavengers on a
field of battle as they rob and then murder a wounded soldier.
These vengeful harpies also assist in Macbeth's death, wounding him
as Macduff closes in for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   As Lady Macbeth, Diane Verona gives an empathic, almost hammy
performance. The actress underlines every speech with such
intensity that she vocally dwarfs Grammer. She even bellows during
the famous sleepwalking scene.
</P>
<P>
   Macbeth's helpmate is supposed to push her husband into murder,
but here, the acting styles of the two leads are so different that
the relationship between husband and wife doesn't get its due. The
twosome are never quite believable as companions in crime.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the large supporting cast is on stage so briefly
that most make little impression. Two exceptions: Peter Michael
Goetz, as the kindly yet doomed Duncan, and Peter Gerety, as the
bawdy Porter, who provides the play's brief moment of comic relief.
Gerety gets his laughs, no small accomplishment in this morose
production.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfeeling'' may be an even better word to describe what
happens on stage. And a production of ''Macbeth'' devoid of any
emotion is not much of a ''Macbeth'' at all.

<HEADLINE> Senate committee approves bear hunt ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Bear hunts in New Jersey would be banned,
under a bill that passed a Senate committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan measure, S-1162, would halt a bear hunt proposed
for this fall by the state Fish and Game Council.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last authorized hunt in 1971, New Jersey's bear
population has soared from about 100 to more than 1,000, according
to Fish and Game officials.
</P>
<P>
   Some northern New Jersey residents have complained that bears
have invaded suburban back yards, killed pets and scared small
children.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the Senate Environment Committee said there must
be better ways to scare off the brazen bears.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. C. Louis Bassano, R-Union, the bill sponsor, called
on state officials to rely instead on sterilization and ''negative
conditioning'' to control the bear population.
</P>
<P>
   ''Negative, aversive conditioning has had very good results,''
said bill co-sponsor Sen. Joseph Vitale, D-Middlesex. ''We need to
target problem-causing bears and leave the rest alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes to the full Senate for action.

<HEADLINE> Yale school teaches women the basics of politics  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Linda Graham's practice stump speech is
going on too long and needs a better focus.
</P>
<P>
   She's trying to get across her family values platform for a
potential election in Michigan. Other women like her, many
newcomers to politics, are trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to protect the freedom families have in the United
States,'' Graham says.
</P>
<P>
   What's your point?
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe our families are in sad shape,'' she replies.
</P>
<P>
   Say it!
</P>
<P>
   ''Our families are in sad shape!'' Graham says, to applause.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and 30 other women in politics from around the country
are studying public speaking, fund raising, polling and other ins
and outs of political life at The Women's Campaign School at Yale
University.
</P>
<P>
   The school counts political leaders from around the world among
its graduates.
</P>
<P>
   While more women around the country are becoming political
leaders, the class of 2000 comes at a time when fewer women are
running for top offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University
reports that women serve in the U.S. Senate and House of
Representatives in record numbers. More women are in top state
elected offices than ever before, and more than one-fifth of state
legislators are women.
</P>
<P>
   Women also are shaping up to be a big force in the presidential
election. Vice president Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush are
trying to attract female voters, and women's names are brought up
as potential candidates for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of female candidates for the 2000 elections is
down from a boom in the mid-1990s, including 1992, which was dubbed
''The Year of the Woman'' after women made huge gains in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to say the sky is falling, but I think there is
reason to be concerned about the number of women running for office
and the rate and level of increase,'' said Debbie Walsh, associate
director of the Center for American Women and Politics.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in candidates may follow national trends of less
interest in politics because of the raging economy and good-paying
private-sector jobs, said George Dean, the co-chairman of the
Women's Campaign School.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there are fewer open seats in Congress this year than in
1992, and possible redistricting after the census scared some
candidates away from the 2000 race, Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen R. Malcolm, president of the women's Democratic
fund-raising group EMILY's List, said that the numbers do not tell
the whole story and that women are in many of the hottest races
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the number of women is as relevant as the
quality of women,'' Malcolm said. ''We see women for the most
competitive races being avidly recruited by the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the number of female candidates will likely jump in
2002, after redistricting creates open seats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh agreed that open seats are key to getting more women into
office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beating incumbents just doesn't happen very often,'' Walsh
said.
</P>
<P>
   The women at the campaign school are far away from Congress.
Many are trying to get in on the ground floor of politics - on
school boards, county offices and city councils.
</P>
<P>
   Programs such as Yale's are important because these candidates
may move up into statewide or national office some day, Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Naumann Blanchard wants to be elected to the Lafayette,
La. parish council and consult other women about how to run for
office. She was encouraged to attend the school on the
recommendation of a judge who had been through the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to get the tools to run an effective campaign,''
Blanchard said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Rebecca Goff of Hampton, N.J. has her sights set on the New
Jersey legislature.
</P>
<P>
   She said she got interested in politics after serving on a
governor's council to put teeth in state domestic violence laws.
She said the experience made her want to take part in making laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to learn how to speak effectively, how to boil down the
issues,'' Goff said.
</P>
<P>
   The five-day school also teaches women how to make the decision
to run for office, how to conduct research and polls, how to plan
and budget a campaign and raise money. They also learn how to get
their messages out in the media and how to craft an effective
message.

<HEADLINE> Financial forms show range of wealth in Congress  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Members of the House, like many of their
constituents, rode the high-tech sector of the stock market in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Saxton, R-Mount Holly, earned $16,000-$65,000 selling
shares of Net2Phone, a New Jersey-based Internet telephone company
headed by Clifford Sobel, the chief fund-raiser for the state GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-Ridgewood, bought up to $15,000 worth of
stock in Cisco Systems last year, adding to a high-tech portfolio
that already included Intel Corp and Motorola Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Long Branch, and his wife Sarah also
dabbled in high-tech stocks in 1999, buying shares of America
Online, Cisco Systems and Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Those glimpses into the private finances of public officials
were made possible by Thursday's release of financial disclosure
forms required annually of every member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-file members of Congress received salaries of $136,700
last year. The forms reveal assets and other sources of income,
plus any trips or gifts paid for by people or groups.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar estimates are not specific enough to give a sense of
someone's net worth, but they do indicate where members fall on the
range of wealth in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there can be little doubt about the wealthiest member of
the New Jersey House delegation: Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen,
R-Harding, the latest in a line of Frelinghuysens to serve in
Congress. He holds millions of dollars worth of stock in Procter &AMP;
Gamble, Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and IBM, among other companies. He also is
the beneficiary of six family trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Among other members:
</P>
<P>
   IBM was the stock of choice for Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-Paterson,
and his wife Elsie. They bought 100 shares last October.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Menendez, D-Union City, and his wife, Jane Jacobson,
bought shares in America Online and in Global Crossing, a
telecommunications company that is battling on Capitol Hill over
billions of dollars worth of radio spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Some members preferred funds over individual stock-picking. Rep.
Chris Smith, R-Robbinsville, and his wife Marie invested much of
their family's money in funds operated by Janus, Vanguard and
Scudder.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Rothman, D-Fair Lawn, had a bulging portfolio that
included nine individual retirement accounts and dozens of money
market and equity investment funds.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure forms showed that Rep. Donald Payne, D-Newark,
owns $1,000 to $15,000 worth of stock in Mail.com, an Internet
company that moved its offices last year from Manhattan to Jersey
City.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman came under fire earlier this year when it
was revealed that her husband, John, was on the board of Mail.com
at the time when the company applied for and received an incentive
grant from the state to move to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The forms also provide a summary of trips taken by members of
Congress and paid for by interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, the Republican nominee for
Senate in New Jersey this year, took a trip to Israel with his
wife, paid for by the American Israel Education Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Pascrell, sponsor of legislation to provide federal funding to
local fire departments, took trips funded by the Fire Department
Instructors Conference and the International Fire Chiefs
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Payne traveled to Beijing and Shanghai, paid for by the Aspen
Institute Conference on U.S.-China Relations, and to Berlin paid
for by the Aspen Institute Conference on U.S.-Russia Relations.
</P>
<P>
   He also traveled to the Canary Islands, paid for by the
Institute for Democratic Strategies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Donates Food to North Korea  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration announced Thursday
a 50,000-ton food donation for North Korea and also offered rare
praise for North Korean President Kim Jong Il for his role in
bringing about this week's historic summit with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the food
donation was long planned and therefore should not be interpreted
as a reward for the breakthroughs achieved at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The food aid will be distributed by the U.N. World Food Program,
which has monitors in North Korea to ensure that it is sent to the
intended recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The new donation brings to 450,000 tons the combined U.S.
donations over the past year through the WFP. An additional 100,000
tons was distributed through a private group.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has been suffering acute food shortages over the
years as a result of drought, flooding and mismanagement of the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
   The summit has changed perceptions here about Kim Jong Il who,
since taking power in 1994, had acquired few admirers here because
of his ruthless repression, attempts to intimidate neighbors and
continuing embrace of policies that have contributed to a prolonged
famine.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher, voicing the change in attitude, said the United States
is ''pleased that North Korea's leader demonstrated practical
statesmanship as he reached agreement with the South's president on
a number of important steps that we think do bode well for the
future of the peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said she wanted to ''acknowledge the positive steps that Kim Jong
Il is taking to move North Korea out of the isolation of the past,
toward an era of reconciliation with the South.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders agreed to work toward the eventual reunification
of the peninsula and to promote reunification of divided families.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton welcomed the agreements
reached on humanitarian and economic cooperation and for a future
summit in Seoul. He said he hoped that both sides ''will continue
down this promising path.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the summit ''marks an initial, hopeful step toward peace
and reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement that he was
encouraged by the latest developments. ''We are beginning to see
the rewards of patient diplomacy backed by strong deterrence,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Biden added, ''Obviously much work needs to be done,
especially in the security realm, where North Korea's irresponsible
proliferation of ballistic missile technology poses a threat not
only to South Korea but to others.''
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, the next step in promoting improved
relations with North Korea will be formal implementation of steps
announced last September to ease sanctions against Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   Once the paperwork is completed, North Korea would be allowed to
export raw materials and goods to the United States and would open
air and shipping routes between the two countries. An announcement
on these measures is expected shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's order would not affect a ban on exports of military
and sensitive dual-use items or most types of federal assistance.

<HEADLINE> Witness pleads for mercy for convicted killer in boy witness case  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - As 8-year-old Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr.
and his mother ran from a gunman they knew was going to kill them,
they must have felt ''fear, terror and abject psychological pain,''
a prosecutor said Thursday as he asked a jury to impose the death
penalty on the man convicted of engineering their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler's attorney asked the jury for mercy, saying
simply: ''There is some good in Russell Peeler.''
</P>
<P>
   The same jury that convicted Peeler in the murders of Leroy
''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke, will now decide
whether he gets life in prison or death.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is expected to begin deliberating Peeler's fate Friday
after receiving instructions from Judge G. Sarsfield Ford. Under
the state's death penalty law, the jury must weigh any mitigating
factors presented by the defense against aggravating factors
presented by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In their closing arguments Thursday, prosecutors focused on the
horror of the crimes: an 8-year-old boy and his devoted mother,
gunned down in their home to stop the boy from testifying against
Peeler in an earlier murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict reviewed for the
jury the gruesome details of the crime, including B.J.'s anguished
cries of ''Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!'' as the gunman fired at
them while they ran up the stairs of their Bridgeport home.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict told the jury they should consider the mother and son's
state of mind when Peeler's brother Adrian, the accused gunman,
allegedly started shooting. He argued that the murders were
committed ''in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner,''
an aggravating factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''What could she have been thinking? ... Other than he's going
to kill me, he's going to kill my baby,'' Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was screaming for his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's attorney, William Koch, argued that Peeler did not
control how the murders were committed or suggest that any torture
be inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no evidence in this case that Mr. Peeler gave any
direction to the person that committed this offense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koch repeatedly told the jury that there is a difference between
convicting Peeler on certain evidence and sentencing him to death
based on the same evidence. H
</P>
<P>
   e noted the prosecution focused on Peeler's motive: that he
wanted B.J. silenced because he planned to testify against him in
the 1998 murder of his mother's boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are you going to kill him because he had a motive?'' Koch
asked.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the jury to impose a life sentence, noting that Peeler
is already serving a life sentence in a federal drug case and will
die in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Koch also argued against the death penalty on moral grounds and
told the jury ''mistakes are made'' because the death penalty is
imposed by human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not right to kill somebody ... It's also not right that
the state - through you - turns around and executes him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a power higher than the state of Connecticut that
should decide when, where and how this man dies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Benedict reminded the jury again and again of the utter
terror B.J. and his mother must have felt in the final moments of
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russell Peeler merits no more regard from you than he extended
to an 8-year-old boy and his mother,'' Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russell Peeler has - on his own - earned the forfeiture of his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedict said other aggravating factors the jury may consider
are Peeler's payments to accomplices in the killings. Josephine
Lee, who claimed she acted as a lookout for Adrian Peeler,
testified that Russell Peeler gave her a handful of crack cocaine
for her role. Gary Garner, the alleged driver of the getaway car,
received a bag full of money, according to testimony during the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Koch, however, argued that there was no evidence that Peeler
paid his brother, Adrian, to commit the murders.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers compromise on transportation funding  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Key Republican leaders agreed Thursday to
funnel $3.75 billion over the next four years to continue a
statewide road and transportation building program.
</P>
<P>
   Differences between bills pending in the state Senate and
Assembly delayed any decision on how much the Transportation Trust
Fund would get and where the money would come from. Without
legislative approval, the fund would have expired in July.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers disagreed on the amount and the length of the funding
plan, with Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union, wanting
$4 billion for the four years. Assembly Speaker Jack Collins had
backed the $3 billion version of the bill introduced in his house.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders were split on how the state money should be
channeled into the fund, with DiFrancesco supporting plans to use
more of the state general revenue and dedicate a higher share of
the gasoline tax.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill features points from each version, including
an Assembly provision that requires lawmakers to vote on any new
highway and a Senate measure that caps salaries, operating expenses
and the amount the state can borrow.
</P>
<P>
   In its first year, the fund will provide a record $900 million
for improvements to state highways and public transportation. The
next three years will each be funded at $950 million.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bill caps state borrowing at $650 million each year.
The remaining money would be taken from a variety of sources,
including the state's general revenues, gasoline taxes and
dedicated sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The size of this program has to grow in order to meet the
demands of the infrastructure,'' DiFrancesco said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the state debt does not have to grow accordingly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have money in the budget that is readily available,'' he
said. ''We should use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman is committed to a program that provides
the transportation state residents need, said spokeswoman Jayne
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is obviously a very complicated bill, very technical. We
want to review it before commenting,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Assembly Transportation Committee will vote to
approve the bill and send the compromise package onto the Senate,
said Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, R-Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will pass on Monday,'' said DeCroce, who chairs the
committee and sponsored the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The next available session for the Assembly to consider the bill
would be Thursday. If it is approved there, DiFrancesco said the
Senate could add its consent that day.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier version passed the Senate 33-3. But DiFrancesco's
companion bill for a constitutional amendment to permanently
earmark gas tax revenues to the trust fund failed to get enough
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats fought to include measures in the bill to prevent
suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   DeCroce said the requirement for legislative approval for new
highways ''takes the so-called sprawl issue out of the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying Thursday before the Assembly committee, Department of
Transportation Commissioner James W. Weinstein Jr. said he had
concerns with the caps on salaries and any ''fix-it-first''
language. Some lawmakers and environmental lobbyists have proposed
that the department be specifically directed to repair certain
roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said such restrictions do not take into account the
realities of construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't make any sense to embody language that you can't
achieve,'' he said. ''You can't set theoretical goals for something
that has to happen in real time.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental activists criticized the measure, saying it gives
too much authority to the transportation department with little
oversight. They also challenged one section of the bill that would
allow new roadways to be built in environmentally sensitive areas.
The law would allow the new construction because it would extend
existing state roads.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realize the need of the trust fund, however, we believe
there should be accountability on the spending side. These are a
lot of tax dollars,'' said Marie Curtis of the New Jersey
Environmental Lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis also told the panel the roads needed to be tied into the
state plan to encourage redevelopment in existing urban and
suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe transportation projects should not be considered in
a vacuum,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Coin Error Could Fetch $100,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- It looks like George Washington might be a
little jealous of all the attention Sacagawea is getting on the new
$1 coin.
</P>
<P>
   One of the golden dollars, which are made at the U.S. Mint in
Philadelphia, was discovered in Arkansas with the front of a
Washington quarter and the back of a Sacagawea dollar.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed to mark the first error of its kind in the Mint's
208-year history -- and the coin could fetch as much as $100,000,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ironic when you think that the U.S. Mint spent $40
million on an ad campaign about how George Washington is happy he's
not on the dollar coin,'' Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World
magazine, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether other coins with the same error are in
circulation. A spokesman for the U.S. Mint did not return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   An Arkansas man found the coin in an uncirculated roll of golden
dollars purchased from a bank. A coin dealer will auction the coin
during the American Numismatic Association's national convention in
Philadelphia in August.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gives Wheat to Afghanistan  </HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- The United States set aside sanctions
on Afghanistan's Taliban rulers Thursday, sending 40,000 tons of
wheat to help ordinary Afghans suffering from a lengthy drought.
</P>
<P>
   As a U.S. ship carrying the aid destined for tens of thousands
of Afghans arrived in neighboring Pakistan's southern port of
Karachi, the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, William Milam, said the
wheat ''shows America's concern for the people of Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the highest regard for the people of Afghanistan and
the sanctions are largely against the government and not against
the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the Afghan government's insistence on continuing to
shelter alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden, Washington early last
year imposed sanctions on trade and investment with the Taliban,
who control the capital, Kabul, and about 90 percent of the
countryside. In November, the United Nations also banned
international flights of Ariana -- Afghanistan's national air
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions were aimed at pressuring the Taliban into handing
over bin Laden, who is accused of masterminding the 1998 bombings
of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people,
including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Milam said there was no government operating in Afghanistan --
which has been fighting a decade-long civil war -- ''only warring
factions fighting over territory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Taliban officials and the United Nations, those
hardest hit by the drought have been Afghanistan's nomadic tribes,
whose livestock has been virtually wiped out. The Taliban have
relocated entire villages to areas where there is water and brought
helicopters loaded with water to some areas.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has issued an appeal for $1.8 million in
emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies announced a $1.4 million donation to help people in
India, Pakistan and Afghanistan -- all hit by the devastating
drought.
</P>
<P>
   In India the monsoon rains have eased the problem, but in
Pakistan and Afghanistan the relentless dry spell continues.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan an estimated 70 percent of the herds in southwestern
and southeastern regions have been wiped out. Tens of thousands of
people are on the move in search of water, say U.N. and Pakistani
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, the Red Crescent Society has set up food
distribution centers. In Afghanistan the plan by the Red Cross and
Red Crescent societies is to set up health services, says a release
issued by the international aid organization.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party candidate Buchanan blasts Bush for removing civil war commemorative plaques </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Reform Party presidential candidate Patrick
Buchanan lashed out at Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday for removing
civil war commemorative plaques from the highest courts in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Bush is kowtowing to the NAACP, quite frankly,'' Buchanan
said during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Removal of plaques that respected and honored Southern
heritage is an act of political vandalism which tells us that
'compassionate conservatism' is but a synonym for squishy
Republicanism.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to accuse Bush of ''sacrificing the honored heritage
of the South to the unappeasable gods of political correctness.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also pumped up support of a proposal by U.S. Sen. Jesse
Helms to cease military aid to countries that ratify the
International War Crimes Tribunal, and he denied reports that
tough-talking radio show host Dr. Laura Schlessinger is on his
short list for running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said discouraging membership in the war crimes tribunal
is an idea that ''deserves the support of every American patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the tribunal - along with the World Trade
Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the United
Nations - an infant institution of world government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It advocates a day when America herself is brought under
global authority, where, under the one-nation, one-vote principle
of the General Assembly, U.S. sovereignty disappears,'' Buchanan
said.

<HEADLINE> Lazio leads New York's frequent fliers  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's U.S. Senate opponent,
Rep. Rick Lazio, led New York's frequent-flying congressmen in
1999, taking nine trips on someone else's tab.
</P>
<P>
   Annual financial disclosure forms made public Thursday show that
Lazio's way was paid by the Mortgage Bankers Association, the Sons
of Italy and ABC News, among others. Among his destinations were
Orlando, Fla., in January and Cape Cod, Mass., for the Fourth of
July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio took a ''family member'' along on seven of the nine trips.
</P>
<P>
   A Lazio spokesman said Thursday that all the trips were
''connected to Congressional work-related events to which he
substantially participated.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Congressman Lazio is called upon to vote on legislation that
effects a wide variety issues and regions,'' the spokesman said.
''In order for him to make informed decisions it is sometimes
necessary to be educated by those who are effected by such
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   On a whole, New York's 31 House members took even more trips in
1999 then they did the year before when 18 of them reported taking
a combined 49 trips. This year, 24 New York lawmakers took 74 trips
to destinations ranging from Qatar and St. Croix to Poughkeepsie,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress are allowed to accept privately-funded trips
as long as they report them in annual disclosure statements and
also in separate forms, which must be filed with the House within
45 days after the travel.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio beat former Democratic Rep. Thomas Downey by attacking his
use of taxpayer funded junkets
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ruskin, executive director of the Congressional
Accountability Project, said some privately-funded travel was
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ''But favor seekers with matters pending before Congress
shouldn't be able to pay for Congressional travel and members
should reject trips that are paid for by those seeking favors,''
Ruskin said.
</P>
<P>
   He called Lazio's trip to Charlotesville, Va., on the tab of the
Mortgage Bankers Association ''a good example of a trip that a
member shouldn't take'' because the group could have business
before Lazio. The Suffolk County Republican is chairman of the
Housing Subcommittee of the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Following close behind Lazio were Rep. Vito Fossella, R-Staten
Island, who accepted eight trips and Rep. Charles Rangel, D-Harlem.
who took six.
</P>
<P>
   The federal disclosure forms require members of Congress to
annually report in the broadest terms their personal fortunes,
investments and income beyond their congressional salary of
$136,700. They must also outline any gifts, travel or honoraria
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Among New Yorkers, the forms ranged from Democratic Rep. Anthony
Weiner's mostly blank two pages to a 24-page compilation of
Republican Rep. Amo Houghton's millions of dollars worth of
investments and assets.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton, formerly the chief executive officer of his family's
Corning Inc., was recently ranked by the Capitol Hill newspaper
Roll Call as the second wealthiest member of Congress with a
fortune estimated at $350 million. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., whose
wife is ketchup heiress Teresa Heinz, has the top spot on the list.

<HEADLINE> Monmouth prosecutor gets committee approval  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday
approved the renomination of Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye,
but only after a grueling hearing in which his fitness for office
was roundly debated.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members cast a party-line 7-3 vote to advance Kaye's
six-year appointment to the full Senate for action. A vote is
scheduled for June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, a Republican who has served since 1983, could not be
reached for comment after the committee vote.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the public who testified either demanded his ouster
or defended his law and order record.
</P>
<P>
   And in a committee first, one witness testified via long
distance conference call from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, seeking his fourth term, has been acting in a holdover
capacity since his last term expired in October. Gov. Christie
Whitman finally renominated him in May.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting Kaye were members of the Monmouth County Human
Relations Council, Women's Center, and Chiefs of Police
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the prosecutor's side was William Thomas, whose
6-year-old granddaughter Amanda Wengert was murdered by a Manalapan
neighbor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But detractors pointed to three cases - two civil suits in which
Kaye was held liable and his prosecution of the man who sexually
assaulted Eddie Werner's killer - as reason to deny him another
term.
</P>
<P>
   Shamren Coleman-Fletcher of Maryland criticized Kaye for
sexually discriminating against her mother, Barbara Coleman.
Coleman, a sergeant in the Prosecutor's Office who has since died,
won $425,000 in damages plus legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye also lost a libel suit brought against him by a former
assistant county prosecutor, who won a $100,000 award.
</P>
<P>
   Nathanial J. Pallone, a Rutgers University psychology professor,
criticized Kaye for using Werner killer Sam Manzie to lure Manzie
molester Stephen Simmons. Instead, the prosecutor should have used
a police officer posing as Manzie, the professor said. Manzie
killed Werner after halting his cooperation in the Simmons
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Another critic, Theresa Castner of Keansburg, blamed Kaye's
office for lax enforcement of a drug dealer who supplied heroin to
her mother and uncle. Both Alice Castner and Robert Castner died of
overdose, Castner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I do know is that there is a law that might have made a
difference but John Kaye opted to write it off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her aunt, Susan Castner also testified against Kaye via
conference call from her home in Japan - a committee first,
according to a committee aide.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Norman Robertson, R-Passiac, approved Kaye's nomination,
but admitted he had reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not a slam dunk,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Teacher accused of having sex with 14-year-old student  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - An eighth-grade teacher was arrested and
accused of having sex with a 14-year-old female student of his, the
Bergen County Prosecutor's Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Levine had sex on ''numerous'' occasions with the girl
since April at his home in East Rutherford and at the Hackensack
Middle School, where he taught, Assistant Bergen County Prosecutor
Patricia Baglivi said.
</P>
<P>
   She said authorities were alerted to the relationship by a
''third party,'' but declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, 27, came to the Prosecutor's Office Wednesday night to
answer questions and was arrested sometime late that night or early
Thursday, Baglivi said.
</P>
<P>
   He was immediately suspended from teaching, pending the outcome
of the investigation, said Joseph L. Montesano, the Hackensack
school superintendent. The Board of Education is likely to halt
Levine's salary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, completing his first year as a full-time teacher, had
been a substitute teacher for a year or two, Montesano said. Levine
taught remedial English.
</P>
<P>
   Levine was held Thursday on $300,000 bail, no 10 percent option,
set by state Superior Court Judge Sebastian Gaeta Jr., Baglivi
said.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged with one count of aggravated sexual assault and
two counts of endangering the welfare of a child.

<HEADLINE> Mets, Yanks, Might Ride Subway  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Yankees and Mets might make this a true
Subway Series -- strap-hanging as they shuttle between games of
their two-ballpark doubleheader next month.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions are under way among the teams and New York City to
have subway trains take the teams from Shea Stadium to Yankee
Stadium for their day-night doubleheader July 8.
</P>
<P>
   For the millionaire players, a Subway Special probably would be
a token appearance in the underground. Buses, cars and limos are
the preferred ground transportation of major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'd be different; it'd be something new,'' said Yankees
catcher Jim Leyritz, who used to take the subway to the ballpark in
the Bronx. ''I'm sure they're going to come up with a lot of
creative things to do for something that hasn't happened in 97
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time major league teams played two games at different
ballparks on the same day was Sept. 7, 1903, according to the Elias
Sports Bureau, baseball's statistician. That was a year before New
York City's subway system opened.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants won 6-4 at Brooklyn's Washington Park in the
opener, then lost 3-0 in the afternoon at the Polo Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   To make up last Sunday's rainout at Yankee Stadium, the Mets and
Yankees agreed that after their regularly scheduled game at Shea
Stadium at 1:15 p.m. on July 8, they would play the makeup at
Yankee Stadium at 8:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are discussions,'' Transit Authority spokesman Al
O'Leary said. ''Whether or not it will work, I don't know. It's
probably more of a question of whether the players will go for it.
We can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the trek by track from Shea in Queens to Yankee Stadium
in the Bronx involves two trains. The players would get on a
special No. 7 train outside the right-field corner at Shea Stadium,
take it to Grand Central, then change to the No. 4 line, which
would leave them outside the left-field corner at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could get off a stop later, at Fifth Avenue and 42nd
Street, and switch to the D train, which also stops outside Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Players, used to free travel, probably would cry foul if they
had to whip out MetroCards to pay their $1.50 fares as they go
through the turnstiles.

<HEADLINE> NRC discusses operations of Hope Creek, Salem nuclear plants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOWER ALLOWAYS CREEK TOWNSHIP N.J. (AP) - Representatives of the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission met with officials from Public
Service Electric &AMP; Gas Co. and the public Thursday to discuss the
annual review of the company's nuclear generating stations in
southern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, in its review from April 1999 to April 2000,
said the Hope Creek Nuclear Plant and Salem Nuclear Generating
Stations all ''operated in a manner that preserved public health
and safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRC said that there had been problems with Hope Creek's
reactor core cooling system and with security on the property, but
that the troubles have been resolved. The commission said it
planned no additional inspections at Hope Creek beyond its normal
inspection program.
</P>
<P>
   At Salem Units 1 and 2, the NRC said it found that carbon
dioxide gas concentrations for fire suppression systems did not
reach and maintain the required levels during testing. PSE&AMP;G said
it would evaluate the cause of this by June 30 and would provide
the NRC with a schedule of corrective actions by July 15. The NRC
will reinspect the system, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1990s, both Salem reactors were plagued by a series
of mishaps and unscheduled shutdowns caused by mechanical failure
and human error. PSE&AMP;G was heavily fined and the NRC in 1997 placed
both reactors on its list of problem facilities requiring increased
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Located on the Delaware River about 35 miles south of
Philadelphia, the reactors supply power to parts of New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Courts Cos. on China Trade  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is turning to corporate
America for help in pressuring the Senate to vote quickly on the
China trade bill that has yet to be called up by Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be very unfortunate if this got caught up in the
everyday Washington politics that seems to slow everything else
down,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Capitol Hill, Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said that
the Mississippi Republican was still trying to bring the measure to
a vote -- and suggested that the decision on Thursday by Commerce
Secretary William Daley to resign to run Vice President Al Gore's
presidential campaign could complicate that effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not helpful,'' Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors had hoped for a final vote before the Fourth of July
congressional recess. But Lott, who supports the bill, has had
difficulty finding a time for it and lining up enough bipartisan
support to move it through the Senate without time-consuming
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Daley ''was the point man on it,'' Czwartacki said. ''I don't
think it will help the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met privately Thursday evening with members of the
Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives, apparently
to discuss how to persuade the Senate to vote before the July 4
holiday. The business group is a traditional ally of the Republican
Party, which controls the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said early this week he won't speed a vote on the trade
bill, saying it needs a full airing with members given the chance
to offer amendments if they want. He also said the Senate must give
higher priority to spending bills needed to keep the government in
operation in the new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Lott supports the trade bill, and White House officials suspect
he has delayed the vote to gain leverage in the budget fight
between Congress and the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is meeting with business leaders ''to talk to them about
getting the Senate a little more energized about doing this
quickly,'' White House deputy press secretary Jake Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said, ''This is one of the most important votes the
Senate will take in a generation and we need to get to this as soon
as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill was approved by a 40-vote margin in the House
last month. It would grant China normal trade relations on a
permanent basis, rather than requiring an annual congressional
review of China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Both major-party presidential candidates support the bill. But
it is being strongly opposed by organized labor, a key Democratic
constituency, and that could weigh in congressional races in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters assert the legislation will open China's vast markets
to U.S. businesses and help bring the nation of 1.2 billion people
-- the world's most populous -- into the world community. Labor
opposes it, criticizing China's human rights and worker protection
policies and suggesting the measure could cost American
manufacturing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The China trade bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277

<HEADLINE> Atlantic City registers ''remarkable'' drop in violent crime  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Violent crime in this casino capital
plunged last year, with the number of reported rapes dropping to
pre-casino era levels, according to a report released Thursday by
police and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The number of murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults
dropped by 10 percent from 1998, while the total number of crimes
dipped by 0.8 percent, according to the report by Atlantic County
Prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a county that lays claim to a casino city where more than
35 million people visit 12 gaming halls each year, these numbers
are remarkable,'' said Blitz. He credited innovative city programs,
stepped-up cooperation between agencies and aggressive
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The report was based on statistics released recently by the
State Police's Uniform Crime Reporting Unit and compared with
historical data for crime in the city and Atlantic County.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlantic City last year:
</P>
<P>
   -There were 640 violent crimes, down from 711 the previous year.
It was the lowest annual total in the city since 1978, when 656
violent crimes were reported and only one casino had opened.
</P>
<P>
   -There were 8,432 nonviolent crimes reported last year, four
fewer than in 1998. Those crimes are burglary, larceny, theft and
motor vehicle theft.
</P>
<P>
   -The number of reported rapes dropped to 27, from 33 in 1998,
the lowest number since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   -Two kinds of crime increased: aggravated assault was up
slightly (281, compared with 273 in 1998) and theft (7,338, up from
7,094 in 1998).
</P>
<P>
   -There were five murders in the city last year, compared with 14
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very pleased with the decrease in the crime statistics
and we will maintain our efforts and our operations toward the
continuing goal of reducing crime every year,'' said Police Chief
Arthur Snellbaker.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Atlantic City's streets, casinos and Boardwalk were
entirely safe places, either, though.
</P>
<P>
   One brazen bandit stole more than $60,000 in a rash of casino
robberies in April, May and June. Edmund Osei, 22, a part-time
dealer at Trump Taj Mahal, allegedly used a toy gun every time.
</P>
<P>
   In June, two German tourists complained about the smell in their
$36-a-night room at the Burgundy Motor Inn - only to learn, after
sleeping on it, that it contained the body of a murdered gambler.
Haila Gabr, 18, of Brooklyn, N.Y., is awaiting trial in the slaying
of Saul Hernandez, 64, of Queens, N.Y., whose body was stuffed into
a wooden frame that supported the mattress and box spring two days
before the couple checked in.
</P>
<P>
   In November, an off-duty Stafford Township police officer nearly
died after being stabbed during an altercation in a McDonald's
drive-thru. Herman Pharo, 24, survived stab wounds to the back and
chest in the incident. No arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Robert Bell, 46, of Atlantic City was shot to death
as he walked through the Stanley Holmes Village housing project.
Police say it was case of mistaken identity. Najee Marshall, 20, is
awaiting trial in the killing.

<HEADLINE> 27 arrested for alleged crack, cocaine distribution  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Twenty-seven people, including some of
Camden's top-level distributors of crack and cocaine, were arrested
in an early-morning raid Thursday, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal, state, Camden County and local authorities made the
arrests, said U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cleary. More than 130 agents,
police officers and detectives carried out the raids. Most of the
suspects were arrested at their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Cleary said those arrested and some of their suppliers and
associates formed a network for distributing cocaine by the
kilogram in and around Camden. Some of the suspects also are
charged with distributing drugs in Pennsylvania and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests capped a 10-month investigation that included the
use of surveillance and wiretaps, Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested were among 34 people named in indictments that
were returned June 14 and unsealed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the suspects were charged with organizing the
distribution of or distributing more than five kilograms of cocaine
and more than 50 grams of crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Four were charged with distributing more than 500 grams of
cocaine, and three were charged with conspiring to possess and
distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from five years to
life, and fines up to $4 million.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Telemarketing Fraud, 206  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) - A federal judge has shut down an Elmira
telemarketing company and given the Federal Trade Commission
permission to seize the company's records to investigate alleged
fraudulent practices.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC filed a civil lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court in
Rochester against Navestar, owner Paul Navestad and Financial
Services Network USA Inc., a corporation doing business as
Borrowing Made Easier, Express Processing Center, FSN and Free Cash
Grants.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that the defendants misrepresented, through
mailings and Internet sites, how people can secure loans or grants
or receive refunds if they did not get the promised grants.
</P>
<P>
   Navestar reaches most of its clients through direct mailings.
</P>
<P>
   According to Financial Services Network USA Inc.'s Web site,
people can purchase a book for about $20 and learn how to obtain
grants and loans worth up to $95,000.
</P>
<P>
   Telesca's order said the defendants failed to comply with
federal telemarketing rules by receiving advance payment and
guaranteeing the buyer will receive the loan or extension of
credit.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Navestad said his client is merely selling books
over the internet and the judge's order squashes his First
Amendment right to do so.

<HEADLINE> UK: Commitment on Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- With all but a small force of
British troops leaving Sierra Leone Thursday, the former colonial
power tried to allay fears that it was abandoning the war-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has gradually withdrawn its 1,000-strong force, sent in
May to stabilize the situation after rebels kidnapped some 500 U.N.
peacekeepers. As they departed, the British handed over the defense
of the capital and airport to a the U.N. forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not leaving,'' British Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott said Thursday after meeting with President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah. ''We are going to be involved in the long-term, to work
with other friendly countries to help maintain democracy in Sierra
Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 200 British military advisers are staying behind to
help equip and train a new national army. The government is
currently defended by an uneasy alliance of private militias and
army soldiers, some of whom fought on opposing sides during eight
years of brutal civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Kabbah said he was confident the British departure would not
leave a security vacuum in the West African nation, where the rebel
Revolutionary United Front reignited the conflict in early May.
</P>
<P>
   ''The British forces were here to stabilize the security
situation and that stability has been achieved and will be
maintained,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing British commander, Brig. David Richards, has said
the U.N. mission has learned from its mistakes and no longer needs
British support. The U.N. force has also nearly doubled in size,
from about 6,000 to 11,850 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Many Sierra Leoneans, however, have pleaded for the British
forces to remain.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very sad day,'' said airport porter Foday Mansaray.
''The deputy prime minister is here, but the soldiers who are
protecting us are going. What are (they) going to do if the rebels
attack again?''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels killed tens of thousands of civilians and
systematically maimed many more in a campaign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Despite signing a July peace accord, the rebels began advancing
on the capital, Freetown last month after seizing the U.N.
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The captives have since been released, and the ragtag coalition
of pro-government forces has been pushing the RUF away from
Freetown. But more than 200 U.N. troops remain surrounded in
rebel-held eastern Sierra Leone, where a new group of 21
peacekeepers has been detained.
</P>
<P>
   As Prescott arrived Thursday morning, U.N. peacekeepers from
Nigeria were attacked by RUF rebels in the western town of Port
Loko, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York. There was a
45-minute exchange of gunfire before the RUF retreated into the
bush. No casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott visited the Royal Navy's HMS Ocean off the coast of
Sierra Leone, which was headed back to Britain with the last of the
withdrawing forces Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   He also toured the government base at Benguema, about 25 miles
east of Freetown, where 45 British instructors will put 1,000
Sierra Leonean recruits through a six-week training course. About
150 other British troops will provide security.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott was leaving Thursday night for Lagos, Nigeria, before
returning to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, a committee of West African leaders began
negotiations in Freetown for a new cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The team is headed by Nigerian Maj. Gen. Gabriel Kpamber, the
former commander of a West African intervention force that defended
the government during the war. Also represented are Mali, Liberia,
Ghana, Togo and Guinea.

<HEADLINE> Dispute Over Spanish TV, Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL FOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic organizer Mitt Romney sought
Thursday to defuse a tiff with a Spanish-speaking television
station that offered to help recruit volunteers for the 2002 Winter
Games.
</P>
<P>
   John Terrell, president and general manager of Telemundo
stations in Salt Lake City and Ogden, said a Salt Lake Organizing
Committee executive told him, ''We only want (volunteers) who speak
English.''
</P>
<P>
   SLOC officials said they are looking for volunteers fluent in
more than one language, including English.
</P>
<P>
   ''I even offered to give them some advertising for free,''
Terrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Romney might take Terrell up on that. SLOC does most of its
advertising at NBC affiliate KSL-TV, an Olympic supplier that is
donating nearly $275,000 worth of advertising for the recruitment
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''My understanding is they'd like to give us some free
advertising, just like KSL does. We're happy to run them,'' Romney
said of the Telemundo stations. ''But we are overwhelmingly focused
on value and keeping our costs down.''
</P>
<P>
   John Renteria, executive director of the Utah Hispanic Chamber
of Commerce, said Telemundo's Utah operation deserves a piece of
the SLOC advertising budget and that Romney's budget restraints
could be seen as discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC trustee Richard Velez said he will try to mediate the
dispute and has been working to organize a meeting of Olympic
officials and Hispanic media representatives
</P>
<P>
   Velez said SLOC's ''English-only'' rebuff was a
misunderstanding. Others say it could be a sign that
Mormon-dominated Utah is struggling to deal with diversity the
Olympics will bring.
</P>
<P>
   An early clash came over Utah's peculiar liquor laws. The
state's provincial image was burnished by Gov. Mike Leavitt's
latest appointment of a white male Mormon as state Olympic officer.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC's upper ranks include no minorities, and only three of 16
senior positions are held by women.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt tapped another Mormon, Romney, to clean up the
organization after the Olympic bribery scandal broke with
revelations that Salt Lake bidders lavished cash, gifts, travel and
other inducements on International Olympic Committee members and
their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Telemundo's complaint recalled a mistake from the Atlanta
Olympics, when a New Mexico man was told foreigners couldn't buy
tickets for the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   When Wade Miller couldn't convince an Atlanta ticket agent that
New Mexico was part of the United States, he pleaded his case with
a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told her I was calling from New Mexico and emphasized the
New,'' Miller said. ''She told me, 'Sir, New Mexico, old Mexico, it
doesn't matter. I understand it's a territory, but you still have
to go through your nation's Olympic committee.'''
</P>
<P>
   SLOC spokeswomen Caroline Shaw said the organization was
reaching out to Hispanic and other ethnic groups. One out of six
volunteers speak Spanish as a second language, she said.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC has enlisted 8,380 volunteers so far who speak a second
language besides English. Salt Lake will host 10 Spanish-speaking
nations in the Winter Games.

<HEADLINE> New search for clues in two decade-old Etan Patz case  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Police were searching for new evidence Thursday
in the case of a boy who vanished 21 years ago, and whose plight
thrust the issue of child disappearances to the forefront of
national consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Officers removed boxes, blue plastic barrels and large pieces of
metal from the former residence of the man suspected, but never
charged, in the 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's a break in the case,'' said Stuart GraBois,
a former federal prosecutor who has remained deeply involved in the
investigation. ''I just think they're trying to see whether they
can come up with any piece of evidence that might further tie in
(Jose Antonio Ramos).''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, already in prison in Pennsylvania for sexually molesting
two boys in unrelated cases, has admitted he was with Etan the day
the boy vanished while walking from his parents' SoHo loft to a
school bus stop three blocks away. But prosecutors have never
collected enough evidence to charge him in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-eyed, shaggy-haired Etan's case helped put the faces of
missing kids on milk cartons and turned May 25 - the date Etan was
last seen - into National Missing Children's Day. His picture was
posted in 60 countries as part of a worldwide search.
</P>
<P>
   Police scoured for new clues Thursday in the basement of the
Lower East Side building where Ramos, a friend of a Patz baby
sitter, lived when Etan disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father, Stanley Patz, said he was contacted by police
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police are out there looking for forensic evidence,'' he
said in a brief telephone interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the search might help resolve his son's case, he
replied, ''I hope so. What else can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   GraBois, the former prosecutor, said he believes Etan is dead.
</P>
<P>
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said cops
hoped to find bone fragments or other DNA evidence that might tie
Ramos to Etan's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Another investigator said it appeared unlikely new evidence
would be found in the basement of the five-story building on East
Fourth Street and Avenue B.
</P>
<P>
   GraBois, who is now executive director of the New York District
Council of Carpenters Benefit Fund, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was still a federal prosecutor, we went down in the
basement and we searched as well,'' he said. ''I guess they want to
give it a shot again.''

<HEADLINE> Son follows Dad with a lifetime of perfect school attendance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUEENSBURY, N.Y. (AP) - Like father, like son.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from his dad, Jason Lanfair, 19, was honored
Wednesday after never missing a day of school from kindergarten
through 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Terry Lanfair, achieved a similar feat 33 years
earlier. Jason's achievement may have topped his father's, he
chided his dad, because the elder Lanfair lived within walking
distance of school, while Jason lived miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't get sick much,'' Jason told the Post Star of Glens
Falls. ''But perfect attendance is kind of a family tradition, and
I guess my father passed it down to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Attending each of 2,535 days of school over 14 years wasn't
easy, however, Jason recalled. Snowstorms and illness often
conspired to try to keep him out of school but Lanfair always found
a way to be in class.
</P>
<P>
   His academic career included one extra school year working
toward graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Excelling at woodworking in his Board of Cooperative Educational
Services curriculum, Jason has a job lined up at Manchester Wood
Inc. of Granville, which manufactures furniture and decorative
items for upscale retail enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas Burn midfielder Brian Haynes announced his
retirement Thursday so the club could pursue younger players.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes, 38, played for the Burn since the team's inception four
years ago. He scored eight goals and had six assists in 77 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a perfect time for me to step away,'' Haynes said.
''The Burn nucleus is made up of young players who are capable of
getting the job done. It was a very enjoyable four years and I have
no regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burn filled Haynes' roster spot with midfielder/forward
Michael Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, 23, played for Loyola, Md. before turning pro after his
sophomore season. He was A-League rookie of the year in 1998 for
Jacksonville and Charleston.

<HEADLINE> Court allows customers to sue GPU  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A state appeals court decided Wednesday
that businesses and residents can bring a class-action lawsuit
against GPU Energy to regain financial losses suffered during a
power outage last summer.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 customers were without power during a broiling
July Fourth weekend when two transformers at a Red Bank substation
failed.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling means several hundred thousand plaintiffs
involved in the class-action suit can seek monetary damages in what
lawsuit attorney Frank Gaudio said is a ''precedent against utility
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In essence, what the court has said is that they can be held
liable for negligence, just like we can be held for negligence if
we are involved in an auto accident,'' said Gaudio, who is handling
the class-action suit. ''They are not immune from that kind of
claim.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his clients have losses ranging from $50 to $40,000.
Some clients include restaurant owners who were forced to throw
away spoiled food.
</P>
<P>
   It could take up to two years for the lawsuit to go before a
jury unless a settlement is reached, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gaudio said the outages were caused by the company's failure to
properly maintain its transformers and assess the amount of
electricity customers would need during the weekend when
temperatures hovered at and above 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   GPU officials have said the two transformer failures were
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   GPU had argued that the Board of Public Utilities, the state
agency that set rates and regulates the industry, should hear the
customers' claims.
</P>
<P>
   The BPU conducted an investigation into the blackout, but said
its role is not to settle claims brought by individuals customers.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of Superior Court
unanimously agreed with the BPU's decision because the agency
resolves only regulatory questions.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the utility customers should have their day in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The events in issue raise only ordinary questions of
negligence,'' states the decision written by Judge Michael Patrick
King and joined by Judges Philip Carchman and Steven Lefelt.
</P>
<P>
   When the case goes before a jury, it will have to determine
whether GPU acted reasonably and whether it breached its duty to
its customers. The appeals court said these issues are beyond the
BPU's scope.
</P>
<P>
   GPU spokesman Ron Morano said the BPU investigation found that
GPU provided safe and adequate service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our point all around is that the board obtain primary
jurisdiction over this,'' Morano said. ''Although the board work is
done for the present, as the litigation goes forward, the parties
... should be mindful of additional areas that fall into the BPU's
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Morano would not reveal GPU's next move, but added: ''We are
continuing to study the opinion. It's an opinion that has many
points to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some 100,000 customers were affected by the power
outage last July Fourth weekend, a judged ruled in October that all
GPU customers in New Jersey could be members of the class-action
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Some 480,000 plaintiffs are members of the lawsuit, Gaudio said.
</P>
<P>
   GPU had already settled with Red Bank for money the borough lost
from labor costs responding to the power outages. Some 17,000 Red
Bank customers were affected in Red Bank during the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the GPU issued a report critical of the GPU and
other utility companies for creating mass confusion by not promptly
informing officials and customers of when and where blackouts would
occur.
</P>
<P>
   GPU officials have said the company will invest tens of millions
of dollars over the next two to three years to speed up new
projects and better withstand record demand.

<HEADLINE> Drunken Driving Standards Set  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted Thursday to set the
first-ever national blood alcohol standard for drunken driving and
to block administration attempts to reduce the hours truckers can
spend driving per day.
</P>
<P>
   The $54.7 billion spending bill to fund highway, rail, aviation
and Coast Guard programs in fiscal year 2001 would require states
to adopt a 0.08 percent blood alcohol content level as their legal
intoxication standard. Those failing to do so by 2004 would begin
losing part of their highway trust fund money.
</P>
<P>
   Currently 18 states and the District of Columbia have 0.08
limits for being legally drunk, while 32 states have less stringent
0.10 limits. The White House supports the 0.08 standard and has
urged Congress to make it federal policy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton congratulated the Senate for passing the
measure, and strongly urged Congress to approve a final
transportation bill that includes it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This reasonable standard will save hundreds of lives and
prevent countless injuries each year and it should be put in place
across the country without further delay,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, which passed 99-0, must still be reconciled
with the House transportation spending bill that passed last month.
The House bill does not contain the drunken driving provision, nor
the ban on proposed regulations that would revise 60-year-old rules
on trucker and bus driver operating hours.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, unlike its Senate counterpart, has language
barring the Transportation Department from studying whether it
should raise fuel efficiency standards for cars, light trucks and
sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
after urging the Senate to oppose the House ban, worked out a
compromise position with Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., and others
concerned about the effects of raised standards on the auto
industry.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed that in negotiations with the House, the Senate
position will be that the Transportation Department and the
National Academy of Sciences study fuel efficiency standards and
related issues such as vehicle safety, but that no new standards
will be promulgated without the approval of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The House, backed by the auto industry, has succeeded in
including the ban in the transportation bill since 1995, but Gorton
argued that with gas prices reaching record levels and the fuel
economy of new vehicles at the lowest point in two decades, it was
time to seriously study the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1975 set the corporate average fuel economy, or
CAFE, standard, at 27.5 miles per gallon on new passenger cars and
20.7 mpg for light trucks. But with new fuel efficiency technology
and the popularity of SUVs, which must only meet the lower light
truck standards, there has been pressure from consumer groups and
the administration for a revision in the standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate attached the 0.08 drunken driving level to a highway
bill in 1998 but it didn't survive negotiations with the House. The
national standard is opposed by the restaurant and beverage
industries, which argue that drunken drivers involved in crashes
have an average blood alcohol content of 0.17, and a 0.08 law would
shift focus away from problem drinkers and toward social drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   But Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), which has pushed for
the national law, say the risk of a fatal crash is 11 times greater
for a person with 0.08 blood alcohol content than for a
non-drinking driver.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who has led the 0.08 campaign,
said the tougher standard would save 500 to 700 lives a year.
''We're talking about a life-saving opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department's proposed rules on trucking
operations would allow long-distance operators no more than 12
hours of driving in a 24-hour period, with a two-hour break within
the period. Current rules, adopted more than 60 years ago, say
drivers can be behind the wheel no more than 10 hours in a day,
followed by an eight-hour rest. But they can then drive the
remaining six hours in the day, adding up to 16 hours in a 24-hour
period.
</P>
<P>
   American Trucking Associations' senior Vice President Jim
Whittinghill said truckers support an update in the rules but
believe Transportation's plan would make the roads less safe
because they would force companies to hire more novice drivers and
operate during daylight hours when the roads are most crowded.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposed rule just will not work in the real world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Mackintosh of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety said
his group feels the rules don't go far enough to help the 1,000
people expected to be killed this summer in large truck crashes --
one-third involving fatigued truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But to freeze the rule-making process ''and place it in
suspended animation for a year is not the right way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration, in a statement, said it ''strongly objects''
to the ban on rule making. ''We cannot reduce motor carrier
fatalities without addressing the problem of operator fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also contains language barring the
administration from issuing any rollover safety rules for SUVs
until the National Academy of Sciences completes a proposed
nine-month study of alleged SUV rollover tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   The only person who didn't vote on the bill was Sen. Jay
Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is S. 2720.

<HEADLINE> Jury awards $1.2 million to black officers transferred to 70th precinct </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal jury awarded $1.2 million in damages
Thursday to 22 city police officers and two sergeants, finding the
city failed to prove it had to transfer black officers to a
Brooklyn precinct to maintain peace after an officer tortured Abner
Louima.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin told the racially mixed
jury after the verdict was announced that the three-week trial had
featured a ''very important case'' and she was sure the verdict
would ''have very important consequences in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict provides for all 24 police employees in the case to
receive $50,000 for emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're quite surprised,'' said Lorna Goodman, a spokeswoman for
the city law office. She said the city had not yet decided whether
to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot of money out of the taxpayer's pocket for an
initiative that was meant to make the situation better and to
comply with the request of the community. In the end, the taxpayers
have to pay this,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the police Commissioner Howard Safir's 1997 decision to
send black police employees to the 70th precinct in Brooklyn after
Louima was sodomized with a broken broomstick by a police officer
''was really a well meaning decision ... not a discriminatory
act.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict had possible ramifications for police departments
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation in
Washington, testified at the trial that the black skin of an
officer could be a resource at the disposal of police commissioners
during an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers and the police employees praised the Manhattan
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sends a message to the police department that you can't
transfer people due to their race,'' said George Cerrone, an
attorney for the Sergeants Benevolent Association, a plaintiff in
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In its closing argument earlier in the week, the city conceded
that the police employees were chosen by their skin color.
</P>
<P>
   City lawyer James Lemonedes told jurors the attack on Louima was
an event that ''was extraordinary, that was remarkable, that
definitely caused outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Safir responded to cries from the community for a police
force that better reflects the largely minority population.
</P>
<P>
   ''Race was a factor. We admit it,'' Lemonedes said. ''We
announce it. We proclaim it. That's exactly what was the primary
factor in these transfers, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the law permits such a transfer if there is a compelling
government interest and if the move fulfills a legal requirement to
be ''narrowly tailored'' to address the need.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was instrumental to there being no deaths, no bodily
injury, no property damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Blessinger, a lawyer for two police sergeants who were
transferred to the precinct, said his clients were ''treated based
on their skin color and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Their skills were not factored into this employment
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blessinger said one of his clients was subdued after the
transfer, but the other ''complained ... he was being treated as a
commodity''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall D. Trager, another PBA lawyer, said in his closing
argument that the officers and sergeants were subjected to insults
when they were sent to Brooklyn, both by fellow officers who
suspected they were sent to spy on them and by members of the
community who called them sellouts and ''Uncle Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Trager said the case was ''simply a microcosm of a larger
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What's apparent from the defense in this case is that there
are still people, there are still municipalities who just don't get
it when it comes to racial issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said those municipalities promise prospective employees that
they do not discriminate and they follow all federal and state
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''They lead people to believe it's not about race. But then,
when the chips are down, you find out it is about race and suddenly
there are exceptions to the rule and race does matter.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay Devil Rays pitcher Juan
Guzman left his minor league rehab start Thursday night with
Triple-A Durham because of shoulder stiffness and will be examined
by team doctors on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman has been on the 15-day disabled list since April 8 with
right shoulder tendinitis. In what was expected to be his final
minor league appearance, the right-hander departed after throwing
45 pitches during 3 2-3 innings against Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Tampa Bay starting pitchers also are on the DL --
Wilson Alvarez, Tony Saunders and Dave Eiland.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez is out for the season after undergoing shoulder surgery.
Saunders, who broke his pitching arm delivering a pitch last
season, is scheduled to throw in a simulated game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland, out with a pinched left hip bursa sac, threw off a
bullpen mound Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Astros' Ken Caminiti Injures Wrist  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- To hear Ken Caminiti talk, his latest trip to the
disabled list could be his last.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston third baseman is expected to miss at least two weeks
after injuring his right wrist in the third inning of the Astros'
5-4 loss to the Colorado Rockies on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays were negative, but Caminiti was scheduled to return to
Houston for tests to determine if he has tendon damage, while the
Astros continued a four-city, 10-game road trip in San Francisco on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's serious, I'm done. I am retiring,'' said Caminiti, who
has been dogged by injuries throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to tell if the three-time Gold Glove winner
was serious about his future, but a stint on the 15-day disabled
list was a reality. The Astros planned to make a roster move
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a difficult thing for us to deal with because he brings
so much power to the lineup,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ''We
don't really have anybody else to replace him with. Billy Spiers
can play third and he is a good hitter, but he is not a powerful
hitter like Caminiti.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, who is hitting .304 with 15 home runs and 45 RBIs,
injured the wrist while swinging through a pitch from Kevin Jarvis.
He dropped the bat on the follow-through, and left when he had
trouble taking practice swings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something popped,'' he said. ''I hope it's not serious. Then
I'll be back in a couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti's injury is the latest setback for Houston (24-41) in
what has been a dismal season for the three-time defending NL
Central champions.
</P>
<P>
   The last-place Astros have struggled offensively and defensively
and hit bottom last Sunday when rookie catcher Mitch Meluskey
punched teammate Matt Mieske during batting practice in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti said Friday he thought Houston's luck may be changing,
but his personal misfortune apparently hasn't
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti missed nearly three months of 1999 with a strained calf
muscle and sat out 21 games in 1998 with a strained quadriceps. He
had shoulder surgery after winning the National League MVP award in
1996 and was slowed by a strained hamstring in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Woods Intimidating at U.S. Open  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The mere presence of Tiger Woods was
intimidating enough for many of the other 155 players teeing off on
fog-shrouded Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Then he had the nerve to go out and shoot a 6-under 65, leaving
his fellow competitors with little to do but put on a brave front.
</P>
<P>
   There were no white towels waved to concede defeat Thursday. Not
so early into the U.S. Open, with thick fog not even allowing the
first round to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear that Woods would make winning this Open a much
more daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tournament is not over,'' Sergio Garcia said. ''It has
just started.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a long tournament. When you slip, you can slip a lot,''
Phil Mickelson said after a 71.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's beatable,'' insisted New Zealand's Michael Campbell, who
also was six shots back.
</P>
<P>
   Brave words, all. But not from Bobby Clampett, who seemed to be
thinking more about his job as a television analyst even though he
was only two shots back after a 67.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy is so good. I'm fascinated by him,'' Clampett said.
''I just love watching him.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Rocco Mediate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not surprised by anything he does,'' Mediate said.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the first round of the 100th Open was written
before almost half the field had even teed off, as Woods used a
brilliant short game to get up-and-down seven times from around the
green to post his 65.
</P>
<P>
   John Huston got in before Woods with a 67 and Miguel Angel
Jimenez was only one back after a 66. But both were virtually
ignored as Woods set the tone for this Open early, before thousands
of fans lined around the picturesque fairways watching his every
move.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez wasn't ready to concede anything.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm tired of it, yes,'' the Spaniard said. ''Tiger is the best
player in the world, but you'd think there's only one player here.
There's 156 players here.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually 155, after John Daly blew up with a 14 on the 18th hole
and withdrew once again from the Open.
</P>
<P>
   But top players like Mickelson and Lehman were already six shots
back of the world's best player, and beware of a Tiger bearing a
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd much rather have the lead than try to catch up,'' Woods
said. ''If you shoot the same score as someone else that's leading
the tournament, you lose. I'd rather be leading.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods will have to protect that lead Friday with a late tee
time, and the rush to finish the rounds suspended by Thursday's fog
could make conditions even worse.
</P>
<P>
   At Pebble Beach, the weather can change at any time, and that
comforts some of those chasing Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good conditions could change tomorrow afternoon,'' Paul
Azinger said. ''Then he will be on the bad side of the tee times.''
</P>
<P>
   A small consolation, perhaps. But just enough to give Tiger's
chasers a bit of much needed hope.

<HEADLINE> US Open Notebook  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Sergio Garcia didn't expect to be
the only guy wearing knickers Thursday in the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   After Payne Stewart was killed last year, Garcia and about four
or five other European players discussed wearing the old-style
pants to honor Stewart in the first round at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   But the 20-year-old Spaniard was the only one who followed
through.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if they felt embarrassed or something,'' Garcia
said. ''I guess it shows the kind of people they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who wore knickers and tam o'shanter caps on the PGA
Tour, died along with five others in an October plane crash, about
four months after winning his second U.S. Open title.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was among the 40 players who attended a Wednesday morning
tribute to Stewart, hitting golf balls into the Pacific from the
18th fairway. Afterward, the youngster broke down in tears while
hugging Stewart's widow, Tracey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did this because Payne was my friend,'' said Garcia, who
wore blue knickers and matching stockings. ''This is the least I
can do for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Garcia, the traditional garb didn't help his
game. He shot a 4-over 75, leaving himself 10 shots behind leader
Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The knickers) played well,'' Garcia said. ''I played bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TIGER'S BALL: Maybe it's the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Woods shot a 6-under 65 in the opening round of the U.S. Open --
his first tournament since formally switching to the Nike Tour
Accuracy ball.
</P>
<P>
   Woods tested the ball during a tournament in Germany, finishing
third, and won the Memorial by five strokes when he used the ball
again. Afterward, he announced he would go with the Nike Tour
Accuracy for good, beginning at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement ended a marketing conflict between Woods top
two golf sponsors -- Nike and Titleist -- that began last year when
Nike entered the ball market.
</P>
<P>
   Most players would be reluctant to change equipment before a
major tournament. Then again, Woods is not the normal player.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have to say that would be a mistake under normal
circumstances,'' Colin Montgomerie told reporters. ''Before you
write that down, let me finish. The 'under normal circumstances'
was the bit I was trying to get at. I believe Tiger won the
Memorial with that ball. Well, he's tested it, hasn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   SUTTON'S WILD RIDE: Hal Sutton pondered a visit to the
aquarium in nearby Monterey. Maybe he was trying to find a little
calm after a wild opening round at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton started off with an eagle at No. 1, holing an 8-iron from
136 yards, and birdied two of the next three holes as well.
</P>
<P>
   After three more birdies, countered by a lone bogey, he arrived
at the par-5 14th with a 6-under score. Unfortunately for Sutton,
his fortunes were about to change dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   His third shot, a pitching wedge from 120 yards, shot through
the green into the back rough, ''a horrendous lie,'' Sutton said.
His chip scooted off the other side of the green, forcing him to
chip again to within 6 feet of the cup. But he two-putted for a
double-bogey 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a weird day,'' he said. ''A lot of good, a lot of bad. I
guess that's U.S. Open stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was asked about his plans for the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I may take my little girls to the aquarium,'' he said. ''I
think that would be a good thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   MICKELSON'S SAVE: Phil Mickelson, who lost last year's Open on
the 72nd hole, was on the verge of falling from contention in the
opening round this time.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson was at 3 over through 12 holes but wound up with an
even-par 71 after birdies on three of the last six. He was six
shots behind leader Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way I played, an even-par score is very good,'' Mickelson
said. ''I was struggling to make birdies. I had a tough time
getting close enough to make many putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's got to catch a Tiger if he wants to win his first
major championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to go out and shoot under par tomorrow,'' Mickelson
said. ''Tiger is playing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   OLLIE'S COMEBACK: Jose Maria Olazabal won't be punching any
walls at this year's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time Masters champion fired a 1-under 70 in the opening
round at Pebble Beach, putting himself in position to make a run
for another major title.
</P>
<P>
   ''The course is difficult, but I played quite well today,'' said
Olazabal, who closed his round with a birdie putt at 18. ''I didn't
play extraordinarily well, but I kept it in the fairway most of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after shooting a 5-over 75 in the first round of the
Open at Pinehurst, N.C., an irate Olazabal took a swing at a hotel
wall and wound up breaking his right hand. He was forced to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   His hand healed, Olazabal put memories of that episode behind
him. These days, he's more concerned with a shaky driver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't been hitting many fairways,'' he said. ''I played
quite well today, but I've got to improve on that. I need more
consistency off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   JESPER'S SHIRT: Jesper Parnevik, known for wearing flashy
colors, was easily visible Thursday -- even as a thick fog covered
Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish golfer wore a bright orange shirt on his way to an
opening-round 73.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was noticeable out there,'' said Tiger Woods, who played in
the same group. ''You could see him in the fog, that's for sure.
He's our beacon, so no one would hit into us.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how bright was Parnevik's shirt? He could be seen from the
fifth tee while standing on the seventh tee -- about 500 yards away
-- as the fog rolled in from Stillwater Cove.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   WOODS ON PAYNE: Saying he didn't want to dwell in the past,
Tiger Woods explained his absence from a tribute to the late Payne
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 golfers took part in an early morning ceremony
Wednesday, hitting balls into Carmel Bay in a scene reminiscent of
a 21-gun salute. But Woods and good friend Mark O'Meara decided to
practice instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all depends on how you are personally,'' Woods said. ''If
that's how you want to put closure to it, that's how you want to
put closure to it. I handle things a little differently.''
</P>
<P>
   After Stewart was killed in an October plane crash, Woods
attended a memorial service in Orlando, Fla., but was among the
players who declined to wear knickers at the final round of the
Tour Championship in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figured I've gone all through it with the memorial
service,'' Woods said. ''I felt by going (to Wednesday's ceremony),
it would be more of a deterrent for me during the tournament,
because I don't want to be thinking about what transpired.
</P>
<P>
   ''Plus, Mark O'Meara is one of my best friends, and we both went
out and played. And he's known Payne longer. He felt the same way.
He felt that we've gone through it all before, and we don't need to
keep bringing it up, especially during a big week.''

<HEADLINE> Protesters Battle Toronto Police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Hurling paint and clumps of dirt, hundreds of
people protesting against poverty clashed with riot police outside
the Ontario legislature in downtown Toronto on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Several demonstrators and at least three police officers were
injured in the violence that lasted almost an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters tossed aside steel barricades shielding the front of
the legislature and a Molotov cocktail exploded in fire on the
building's steps, prompting riot police to charge the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   As police -- some mounted on horseback -- tried to push back the
crowd, protesters heaved bricks, dirt, crumpled placards and cans
of paint at them. Some police officers clubbed protesters who
refused to move.
</P>
<P>
   One demonstrator was hospitalized with a head injury and others
sustained cuts, bruises and other minor injuries. The three
policemen had minor injuries. More than a dozen people were
detained.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, from a loose coalition that defends the rights
of the homeless and opposes cuts in social spending by the Ontario
government, had warned of possible violence before the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to Ontario Premier Mike Harris in March, the
Coalition Against Poverty said it would march on the legislature on
June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to see mobilization against you and all you stand
for taken to a level that is powerful and disruptive enough that
your hateful government can no longer proceed with its agenda,''
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, some protesters wore goggles or cardboard gas
masks, and others quickly grabbed any projectile available to hurl
at police when the clashes began.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy police chief Michael Boyd blamed the protesters for the
violence, saying: ''It's clear ... that there was a plan by some
people not to demonstrate peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest began with a festive mood at a downtown park with
homeless people dancing, chanting and listening to speeches
critical of Ontario Premier Mike Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers blamed the Harris government for cutting spending on
social programs and marginalizing the poor to generate tax cuts for
the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we came to resist and to fight, and to say what we want
now is housing,'' said Gaetan Heroux, a spokesman for the Ontario
Coalition Against Poverty. ''When we ask for more housing, they
build more jails.''

<HEADLINE> Private garages sue state over auto emissions test  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A group of private garages that invested
large sums to purchase enhanced auto emissions testing equipment
sued the state Thursday, alleging state officials are letting the
state's contractor off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor, Parsons Infrastructure and Technology, is being
allowed to use the state's old tailpipe test to measure car
emissions at select auto inspection stations to alleviate long
lines at stations that use the enhanced test.
</P>
<P>
   The private garages say Gov. Christie Whitman, and the
Departments of Transportation and Environmental Protection denied
their constitutional rights by forcing them to pay for and use the
more expensive enhanced equipment while letting Parsons off easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor, DOT and DEP in January changed the rules of the
game for its contractor Parsons but not for the private inspection
facilities,'' Belleville garage owner Enzo Olivieri said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gordon, a lawyer representing the 200 garages that filed
suit, said they each invested about $50,000 in new equipment to
offer the enhanced test, which is designed to more accurately
measure pollutants to bring New Jersey in line with federal clean
air regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman in January scaled back the enhanced test at some of the
Parsons stations after the system suffered chronic problems, long
lines and faulty equipment following its start-up in December.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said the private garages have suffered a 7 percent loss
in business since some of the Parsons stations started offering the
easier test.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the group is seeking a public hearing on the
changeover, which it says is required by the 1995 state law that
ushered in the enhanced test.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report blamed the Whitman administration for looking
the other way in the months prior to the launching of Parsons' $500
million contract. The report said some state officials ignored or
squelched warnings that the contractor bungled the new system.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Commissioner James Weinstein Thursday said the
garage owners' lawsuit is misguided.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the garages that invested in the new
equipment are doing more tests than they did during a comparable
period last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We obviously disagree with these folks. If we go to court,
we're on firm ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a related note, Weinstein said that the federal Environmental
Protection Agency recently granted the state another month to
comply with clean air regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The state needed the extra time, until Aug. 1, to hire more
workers and establish appointment schedules for motorists to
decrease waiting times before completely changing over to the
enhanced test.

<HEADLINE> Golfer Clampett Refuses To Give Up  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- He never knew how precious the gift
was until he lost it.
</P>
<P>
   And then got it back.
</P>
<P>
   Even if just for one day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was,'' 40-year-old Bobby Clampett said, ''almost like
playing golf in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   This is of those stories about not giving up, about a man on the
cusp of having it all who learned to make do with what was left.
For a few minutes on an appropriately mist-shrouded day, Clampett
had a share of the lead at the U.S. Open. This wouldn't have raised
eyebrows 20 years ago, when he was one of the best young golfers on
the planet. Now that seems like another lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Clampett was a three-time All-American at Brigham Young
who joined the PGA Tour in 1980 as one of the most heralded golfers
of his generation. He did not disappoint -- not at first, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Clampett climbed all the way up the money list to No.
14. The season after that, he won the Southern Open, tied for third
in the U.S. Open on the same Pebble Beach layout he grew up playing
and then nearly stole the British. And then it all went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a superstar waiting to happen,'' Paul Azinger recalled.
''But something happened along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no less mystifying to Clampett today than it was then.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could see what was wrong on film, but I could never figure
out a way to fix it,'' he said. ''I was playing competitively,
trying to make a living and I knew there were flaws I couldn't fix.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was,'' he said finally, ''a test of character.''
</P>
<P>
   Every life, it seems, has at least one ''what if'' juncture
somewhere along the path; Clampett barreled through his and tried
to keep going. He struggled with his swing, with his confidence,
his attitude and finally with his faith. He went from one swing
doctor to another, immersed himself in arcane theories and prayed
he could play himself out of the slump. Nothing helped.
</P>
<P>
   He fell to 64th on the money list in 1983, to 117th the year
after and remained in a free-fall until 1995. He was 299th on the
money list that year with a family in tow and a job offer from CBS
to put down his clubs and pick up a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look at the family priorities, the need to be a dad and a
husband and well, you throw those things in, and it just didn't
make sense for me to compete,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was convinced then the dream was denied, not simply deferred.
Clampett let golf go and focused his considerable energies on the
broadcast side of the business instead. He could still play a
little, to be sure. But even at his best, the question Clampett
faced was never ''Would he come back?'' but ''Didn't you used to
be?''
</P>
<P>
   That's the funny thing about having a gift. As suddenly as it
goes, it sometimes returns.
</P>
<P>
   Clampett had dinner one evening with fellow CBS broadcaster and
former U.S. Open champion Ken Venturi and they started talking
about the Presidents Cup competition. Venturi was selected to
captain the squad, and Clampett asked what it would take to get
himself added to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'Win the Open,''' Clampett recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I said, 'OK. That's my dream. I'm going to play one
tournament this year and let's see if we can get into it.'''
</P>
<P>
   They both laughed, and that was going to be it -- except. Except
Clampett started driving golf balls down the spacious lawn in front
of his home in North Carolina. In his mind's eye, he was a kid
again, back in Monterey, trying to humble Pebble Beach. Never mind
that Clampett had played just one tournament in the last 21 months,
or that he had only tried to make it through Open qualifying twice
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the 18th at Woodmont Country Club on the last day of
qualifying this year with 243 yards left to the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told my caddie I was going to have to hit a lot of shots
that hard to get to the Open, so we might as well start now,''
Clampett said.
</P>
<P>
   He reached the green in two, made birdie and everything else
fell in place. He was the fourth alternate for a spot at Pebble
Beach, but the rest of the dominoes fell one after another. And
then came Thursday morning, when Clampett starting knocking down
the flags as well. He looked up and his name was back on the
leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never met anybody's expectations,'' he said, ''nor my own.
Then, to suddenly be hitting shots like that, well, they were some
of the best golf shots I've ever hit.''
</P>
<P>
   But something even more important had changed. The return of his
gift -- for no matter how long it lasts -- would not have been nearly
as satisfying without the chance to share it with the people whose
presence had filled the void it left in Clampett's life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted my kids to come out here and experience a part of my
life that they never got to see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With that, he draped an arm around his 10-year-old son, Danny,
and headed for the door. He would worry about tomorrow later. He
already had more than he ever expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're at the bottom,'' he said, ''there's nowhere to go
but up.''

War Breaks Out in Canadian Alliance Ranks Over Quebec
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A battle royal has broken out in the Canadian
Alliance ranks over leadership candidate Tom Long's success in
Quebec, with some of Long's provincial organizers there accusing
rivals of intolerance toward Quebecers.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions exploded Thursday following reports that Long, an
Ontario Tory organizer, had signed up a whopping 2,800 members in
Quebec's Gaspe region -- currently held by a Bloc Quebecois MP.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers have been openly questioned by supporters of Long's
fellow candidates, with some privately suggesting memberships were
paid for.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien and the federal Tories in the House
of Commons also took the opportunity to ridicule the Alliance over
the feat.
</P>
<P>
   Long's Quebec staff say they feel unfairly targeted by Canadian
Alliance officials, and are questioning whether they'll remain in a
party which they say shows open hostility toward Quebecers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bit unfortunate that some people in the Alliance have
chosen to suggest that if we recruit in Quebec, there's always
something crooked about it,'' said organizer Frederic Loiselle.
</P>

Anti-Abortion Group set To Endorse Day For Leadership
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- One of Canada's largest anti-abortion groups is
preparing to endorse former Alberta treasurer Stockwell Day as
leader of the Canadian Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hughes, president of the Campaign for Life, said Thursday
that in response to many requests from members he will advise they
support Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''This'll be unusual for us, but there's a cry asking 'Just who
do we support here,' '' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'll tell members to choose Day first and former Reform
leader Preston Manning second.
</P>
<P>
   Day is vocal about his pro-life stance, and earlier this week
lashed out at two of his leadership rivals for shying away from the
issue.

Chenard Challenges Quebec's Language Laws
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Alain Chenard says he feels as if he lives in a
dictatorship because the Quebec government won't let his children
attend an English school.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to ensure his children can speak English, Chenard
and his wife joined 10 other predominantly francophone families
Thursday in a court challenge against sections of Quebec's language
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Court challenges against the language laws are usually by
anglophones seeking to protect their English rights.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether parents who have received the majority of
their schooling in French can send their children to Quebec's
English schools, which is prevented under the law.
</P>
<P>
   Children of anglophone parents educated in English in Quebec or
anywhere in Canada have access to English schools.

Chretien Defends Human Resources Minister Stewart
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien defended Human
Resources Minister Jane Stewart and her department Thursday in the
face of suggestions that he is thinking of demoting her and
breaking up the department.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the minister of human resources has done a great
job,'' Chretien told opposition MPs who taunted him in the Commons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will keep defending the programs that have been put in
place by this government to help the poor, the people who need help
in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither Chretien in the House, nor Stewart in a later
interview with The Canadian Press, quite shut the door on a rumored
reorganization at Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   A Liberal-dominated Commons committee recommended two weeks ago
that the problem-plagued department be split into three pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien has acknowledged the government is thinking about
whether to implement the recommendations but has also indicated
that, no matter what, Stewart will be at the cabinet table.

Report: More Workers Needed For the Environment
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- There may be fewer Fs this year, but the
environmental record of the provinces and federal government
shouldn't make anyone proud, says the Sierra Club of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report card, the watchdog group says environmental
protection isn't a priority across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of Ottawa and the provinces to do anything has
declined because there are fewer staff to monitor and enforce laws
and do basic scientific research, said John Bennett, the
organization's director on energy and atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario needs the most work, says the report. It failed in
biodiversity and climate change, mostly because it lacks
commitment, and budgets have been slashed, says Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   The provincial Ministry of Natural Resources was cut $85 million
this year alone, said the report card, and the Environment
Department budget is about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of what it
was five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate category, Nova Scotia got an F for efforts to
clean up the Sydney Tar Ponds, said the Sierra Club. The properties
border the former Sydney Steel coke ovens site, a blighted
landscape where toxins ooze from the ground.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Wild To Play At 'The X'  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Anaheim has The Pond. Minnesota now has
''The X.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL expansion Minnesota Wild said Thursday that their
multipurpose sports and entertainment arena will be named Xcel
Energy Center as part of a 25-year deal reportedly worth between
$75 million and $80 million with utility company Xcel Energy Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our company,''
said Jim Howard, president and CEO of Minneapolis-based Northern
States Power, which is merging with New Century Energies, of
Denver, to form Xcel Energy Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would reveal terms, but Xcel is expected to pay
about $3 million a year in cash and services to place its name on
the new $130 million arena.
</P>
<P>
   The entire fee for the naming rights will go directly to the
Wild, helping offset $3.5 million in annual rent the team is
required to pay to help the city and state recoup public funds used
to build the 18,600-seat arena, part of the RiverCentre complex.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes a sweeping advertising partnership,
electricity costs, luxury suites and tickets.
</P>
<P>
   NSP and NCE announced merger plans last year with headquarters
in Minneapolis. Final approval of the merger is expected in July.
The new utility company will serve electric and gas customers in 12
states.
</P>
<P>
   The Xcel arrangement doesn't affect a 10-year, $2.25 million
naming rights deal struck last year between the RiverCentre and an
Xcel competitor, Touchstone Energy, the nation's largest consortium
of rural electrical cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   The city provided $65 million in bonds to build the 18,600-seat
arena, and the state funded the other half of construction costs
with a $48 million interest-free loan and a $17 million grant made
in exchange for the Wild opening the arena for public events,
including the state high school hockey tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild begins play in the Northwest Division of the NHL's
Western Conference in October. The team is preparing for next
week's expansion and entry drafts.

<HEADLINE> GOP Says Plan Would Ensure Coverage  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans said Thursday their plan for
prescription drug insurance for the elderly envisions federal
financial incentives to insurance companies to make sure coverage
is available nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've tried to allow as much flexibility with this ... to
accommodate any scenario that we might be able to run into,'' said
Rep. Richard Burr, R-N.C., among the architects of the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   A new draft summary of Republican legislation being prepared for
House action -- possibly as soon as next week -- offered no details
about how much such incentive payments might cost. But Burr and
other authors of the bill said they believed private coverage could
be guaranteed everywhere in the country within the $40 billion
Republicans have budgeted over five years to create a new Medicare
drug benefit for retirees.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you say that you're going to hold out resources until plans
come in ... it becomes a highly expensive, extremely inefficient
way to provide coverage,'' said White House health care adviser
Chris Jennings. ''And most importantly ... it certainly doesn't
ensure affordability to the beneficiary.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed a standard drug benefit under
Medicare, adding prescriptions to other health care services
covered by the program if retirees choose to pay an additional
monthly premium -- about $50 a month once coverage is fully phased
in.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, House Republicans would enlist private insurers to
sell government-subsidized and approved prescription drug insurance
policies to Medicare beneficiaries -- in much the same way as the
program now contracts with HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has questioned how the Republican plan would guarantee
that insurance companies would step up to offer the new drug
policies -- especially in rural areas with low populations -- and
keep them affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry leaders also say that drug-only insurance
policies for the elderly, who have the highest medicine costs of
any age group, might not be workable.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have promised that the government would act as the
''insurer of last resort'' if insurance companies did not come on
board. New details of their plan, released Thursday, explained that
to mean that the government would provide incentive payments, in
effect taking on some of the companies' financial risks, if
necessary, to attract them.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive payments would be on top of a standard government
subsidy that all participating insurance companies would get.
</P>
<P>
   Under the emerging GOP plan, costs paid by senior citizens would
vary, but insurance companies would have to provide drug benefits
of at least the same value as a standard plan set by law.
</P>
<P>
   The standard plan would have a $250 deductible, then 50-percent
copayments for the first $2,100 in total prescriptions annually. At
that point, coverage would end for the year unless total drug costs
surpassed $6,000. Then, ''catastrophic'' coverage would kick in,
paying all remaining bills for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Talking points distributed to the House Republican rank and file
by party leaders this week show they intend to try to draw several
distinctions between their approach and Clinton's. Among these:
</P>
<P>
   --The GOP plan will not be ''one-size-fits all,'' the talking
points said. ''We give seniors more options to choose the drug
coverage that best fits their needs, rather than just one
government-administered benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   --Also, all private drug insurance policies under the GOP plan
would have to have catastrophic coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Democrats have said they want to add a similar
feature to their plan, but it currently calls for benefits capped
at $2,500 annually.

<HEADLINE> National Stocks Bail Out Oil Co.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the first such move in four years, the
government on Thursday ordered 500,000 barrels of crude oil from
the U.S. strategic reserve to be loaned to a Louisiana refinery
that has been cut off from tanker deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The oil will begin flowing Friday from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve's West Hackberry site near Lake Charles, La., to a nearby
Citgo refinery, the Energy Department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The refinery was cut off from supply ships this week when a dry
dock collapsed into a vital waterway. Without an oil loan, the
Energy Department said, the refinery would have started drying up
as early as this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the loan, Citgo will reimburse the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, kept in case of a national emergency, with ''an
equivalent value'' of oil after the waterway is cleared, the
department said. This will result in interest on the loan when
Coast Guard cranes clear the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Strategic Petroleum Reserve last used its oil exchange
authority in May 1996, when it lent 900,000 barrels to Arco because
of a blocked pipeline.

<HEADLINE> Native Americans Debate Team Names  </HEADLINE>
By NIALA BOODHOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Jim Billie, a chief of the Seminole
tribe, upset some other American Indians on Thursday when he said
he didn't care if the mascot for Florida State University was named
after his people.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does not affect us,'' Billie said, joking that he thought
FSU stood for ''fat, short and ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   American Indian activists and others complain the mascots are
derogatory, which has led to a growing national trend among
schools, universities and professional teams to shed the nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are we prostituting our culture?'' asked Navajo Times editor
Tom Arbiso, who led the discussion as part the Native American
Journalist Association's annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State has faced pressure to give up its nickname. At
football games, a student clad in traditional Indian costume,
including headdress and war paint, rides around the field on a
horse.
</P>
<P>
   But Billie said the tribe has never considered the university's
nickname offensive, adding he thought the school chose the name
because the Seminole tribe was never defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Billie said they do not receive any money from the school for
use of the name.
</P>
<P>
   Indians should be united on the issue over the use of their
names for sports teams, Navajo Times journalist Eugene Tapahe told
Billie.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can't be they, or them, it has to be all of us,'' Tapahe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people eat bear, some don't,'' Billie replied, inviting
those who disagreed to present their case at a Seminole tribe
meeting. ''I stay away from your culture.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Pinellas County school district decided to
consider whether to stop using Indian names for sports team mascots
after complaints of insensitivity from activists.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools have already changed names.
</P>
<P>
   The St. John's Redmen are now the Red Storm and Stanford fans
cheer for the Cardinal instead of the Indians. Miami of Ohio has
also changed its nickname from the Redskins to the RedHawks.

<HEADLINE> Neil Simon Hits Featured  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- No need to travel to Bucks County, Ogunquit,
Cape Cod or other once-famous stops along the East Coast
summer-theater circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Lightweight, hot-weather fare, the kind of comedy once known as
''frothy,'' lives right in Manhattan, where the Roundabout Theater
Company is presenting ''Hotel Suite,'' a collection of Neil Simon's
greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the evening is a compilation of one-acts from each of
Simon's ''Suite'' plays -- ''Plaza Suite,'' ''California Suite'' and
''London Suite.'' And ''frothy'' may be too kind an adjective to
apply to these Simon snippets, some of which haven't worn
particularly well, particularly in this skimpy and undercast
production.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the evening's four sketches are from ''California
Suite,'' which originally opened on Broadway in 1976. The
curtain-raiser concerns Diana, a boozy British actress in Los
Angeles for the Academy Awards, and her gay husband Sidney, who
works as an antique dealer in London.
</P>
<P>
   The playlet consists mostly of snide comments about the Oscars --
from the clothes the women wear to the morose, deadly behavior of
the losers after the ceremony. Between the caustic observations,
Diana and Sidney snipe at each other, particularly about Sidney's
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Carey and Leigh Lawson don't have an easy time with the
banter, which often misfires. It doesn't help that the characters
are vaguely unpleasant, too.
</P>
<P>
   Diana and Sidney make another appearance in Act 2, this time in
a scene from ''London Suite,'' originally done off-Broadway in
1995. By now, Diana is a hugely successful television star with her
own hit series and Sidney is living on a Greek island with his male
lover. Their animosity and affection for each other are still
there, only now Diana has the upper hand as Sidney comes to ask a
favor.
</P>
<P>
   The two performers do better in this more sober, somber section.
Their characters are more fully developed, and the laughs come out
of the people, not Simon's eagerness to crack another joke.
</P>
<P>
   The two remaining plays are out-and-out farces. In the second of
the two ''California Suite'' pieces, a Philadelphia businessman
wakes up to find himself in bed with a nearly comatose prostitute.
With his wife arriving any minute, the man must do something to
hide this raunchy sleeping beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Orbach has the desperation down exactly right as the
more-than-harried husband, and Randy Graff comically nails the
wife's justified outrage.
</P>
<P>
   The actors are less successful in the evening's final offering,
the last section of ''Plaza Suite,'' which originally opened on
Broadway in 1968. In it, Orbach and Graff play frantic parents
whose daughter locks herself in the bathroom of a hotel room --
right before the wedding -- and refuses to come out. They do
everything except dynamite the door to get her back to the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Farce is a delicate commodity. It can't be forced. In this
sketch, the actors push too hard, straining for laughs that lose
their effectiveness when the audience sees them sweat -- and mug.
</P>
<P>
   Director John Tillinger keeps thing moving at a reasonable clip,
although he should have hired a better decorator for this parade of
expensive guest rooms. Designer James Noone's meager settings look
more bargain-basement than high-end luxury, not the kind of
accommodations one would expect for people used to staying in
''Hotel Suites.''

<HEADLINE> Utility will pay for puppy's surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTICELLO, N.Y. (AP) - After a wave of support for an injured
puppy, New York State Electric and Gas has agreed to pay for hip
surgery for the dog hit by one of the utility company's vehicles
last week.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, NYSEG said it would pay the $666 medical
bill plus $700 for the original cost of the German shepherd puppy
and whatever it would cost to put her to sleep. It declined to pick
up what was originally estimated at $2,500 for hip surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Carol McEneaney refused the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sabine, the Liberty area NYSEG representative, called
McEneaney Wednesday, saying the company had reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   The puppy's plight gained national attention. A Binghamton TV
station interviewed Carol McEneaney and Inside Edition offered to
film Thursday's trip to Oradell, an animal hospital in New Jersey.
A Monticello lawyer volunteered his services if the McEneaney's
decided to sue the utility.
</P>
<P>
   Callers across the country told the McEneaneys they would
contact NYSEG and tell it to reconsider. Many callers offered to
donate money for Shera's vet bills, if NYSEG still refused.
</P>
<P>
   Sabine called McEneaney yesterday morning, offering to
personally deliver a check for the surgery. He called back later,
saying NYSEG would pay her $1,600, which was the fee the hospital
quoted, McEneaney said. NYSEG will also pick up her travel costs.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-month-old dog was hit last Wednesday by the meter reader's
truck as it left the family's driveway.
</P>
<P>
   McEneaney said she had opened the garage door to get out toys
for her two small daughters when her two dogs ran out to the truck.
The puppy didn't make it past the vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Armey Ranks Last in Personal Wealth  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They are among the most powerful people in
Washington, but leaders of the House of Representatives are far
from the wealthiest, according to 1999 financial disclosure
statements released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As varied as the 435-member House itself, the forms show a broad
range of income and assets, from church preaching to thoroughbred
horses to wine grapes, as well as debt from credit cards and
children's college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Dick Armey, second in command among House
Republicans, ranks near the bottom in personal wealth even though
his salary, at $151,800, is very high by national standards. Rank
and file House members make $136,700.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, R-Texas, a former college professor, reported no assets
worth more than $1,000 and only supplemented his salary with a
$2,400 annual teacher's pension.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., owned greater assets than other
House leaders, but also had significant liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   He valued a 270-acre farm in Shipman, Ill., a townhouse in
Washington and a Plainfield, Ill., building each at $100,000 to
$250,000. But he still owed between $50,000 and $100,000 on each of
those properties.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are required to report the value of their assets,
income and debts only within broad ranges.
</P>
<P>
   They show income from all types of sources. Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif., listed as assets held jointly with her husband two
California vineyards, each worth up to $5 million and each
producing rental income.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., listed interest in eight
thoroughbred horses worth a total of $20,500, including a colt
named Mister Goodie and a filly called Lady of Dover, valued at
$3,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., a member of the Pro Football Hall
of Fame, made $23,500 by signing football cards and donated $1,500
of it to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Another former football star and Southern Baptist preacher, Rep.
J.C. Watts, R-Okla., was paid more than $19,000 for appearances at
19 churches around the country. The former University of Oklahoma
quarterback and Canadian football player took 28 all-expense-paid
trips, including one to the Fiesta Bowl football game paid for by
the game's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., listed a mutual fund
worth $15,000 to $50,000 and four other funds valued between $1,000
and $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt also carried major liabilities, including two
student loans for his children. He owed between $50,000 and
$100,000 on one student loan, $15,000-$50,000 on a second and also
borrowed $15,000-$50,000 on his life insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   College costs were a common liability. Rep. Jack Quinn, R-N.Y.,
attached a separate letter noting that his financial picture
''continues to be affected by education expenses for a fourth
year.'' Tuition for his son and daughter reached a combined $30,000
in 1999 and both are going on to graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., member of a famous and wealthy
political family, reported $15,001-$50,000 in debts on his American
Express card despite mutual funds worth at least $195,000 and
income from trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, on the other hand, did
not list any liabilities. DeLay valued his Exxon stock between
$50,000 and $100,000 and had a bank account worth between $1,000
and $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 Democrat, Minority Whip David Bonior of Michigan, had
one of the busier travel schedules with 12 trips paid for by
others, including an AFL-CIO meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and
a trip to China sponsored by the Aspen Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior listed only two assets, a credit union account and a bank
account each valued at less than $1,000, but his wife had
additional holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The third-ranking Democrat, Texas Rep. Martin Frost, listed
investments in more than a dozen blue chip stocks such as Exxon,
Coca-Cola and General Electric. He earned varying amounts from
dividends and sales of the stock, none higher than $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among the wealthier set, the retiring chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, attached a detailed
financial statement to his report listing assets of $3.3 million
and no liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Microsoft and Intel stock, Archer reported owning
a 1987 Dodge truck worth $2,000, a 1988 Mercedes valued at $24,000,
a 1998 Jeep Cherokee at $20,000 and a tractor worth $17,000. He
valued his coin collection at its cost: $16,326.
</P>
<P>
   Another highly detailed statement, pages and pages of
investments as thick as a city phone book, was filed by Rep. Robert
Clement, D-Tenn. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., also filed a
doorstop-size report that went far beyond the legal requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., listed the dozens of trinkets a
Congress member gets. Among them: a stuffed animal, hats, pens,
plaques, a box of Alka-Seltzer, a cake, a mouse pad, chips and
salsa, calendars, cologne and ''18 ears of corn and three
tomatoes.''

<HEADLINE> NJ's Gomez Named Top NHL Rookie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Scott Gomez, who led all first-year players in
points and helped the New Jersey Devils win the Stanley Cup, won
the Calder Trophy as the NHL's outstanding rookie Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, 20, the first NHL player from Alaska, had 70 points (19
goals, 51 assists). He was New Jersey's second choice, 27th
overall, in the 1998 draft and moved up from juniors to a regular
spot with the Devils this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an amazing script,'' said Gomez. ''I couldn't have
imagined it any better in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez was given his award by actor Christopher Reeve, who is
paralyzed, and Reeve's 8-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an honor to be up here with Mr. Reeve and his son, he
shows what courage is about,'' said Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez is the second Devil to win the Calder. Goaltender Martin
Brodeur won it in 1994 in voting by members of the Professional
Hockey Writers' Association.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have won the Calder three of the last four years.
Colorado's Chris Drury got it last year and Bryan Berard got it in
1997, when he was with the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh wing Jaromir Jagr, the league's leading scorer, won
his second straight Lester B. Pearson award from the NHL Players'
Association as the top player. He also was a finalist for the Hart
Trophy, to be awarded later Thursday night to the league's most
valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Pronger of the St. Louis Blues won the Norris Trophy as
best defenseman, while his boss, Joel Quenneville, took the Adams
as top coach.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger, at 25 the youngest winner in 15 years, succeeded
teammate Al MacInnis in winning the Norris. They are the only two
Blues to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ''A special thanks to Al MacInnis, who helped guide my career
when it looked like it was going nowhere,'' said Pronger, who led
the league in plus-minus raings at plus-52.
</P>
<P>
   The Adams, given by the NHL Broadcaster's Association, went to
Quenneville after he led the Blues to a league-best 51-20-11-1
record. The Blues also allowed a league-low 165 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Steve Yzerman, whose transformation from sharpshooter
to complete player helped the Detroit Red Wings win the Stanley Cup
in 1997 and 1998, won the Selke Trophy as the NHL's best defensive
forward. Yzerman twice scored more than 60 goals in a season, and
five times had more than 50, but Detroit didn't win until he
committed equal effort to both ends of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Ken Daneyko, who has appeared in every one of New
Jersey's postseason games, took the Masterton Trophy for
perserverance and dedication to hockey. Daneyko has overcome an
alchohol problem to appear in 1,000 NHL games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hockey has been the one constant in my life. That's what I'm
most proud of,'' he said. ''I never expected this, but it certainly
caps off a nice year after winning the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto goalie Curtis Joseph was given the King Clancy Memorial
Trophy in honor of his humanitarian work. Joseph started a program
called Cujo's Kids that helps critically ill children at the
Hospital for Sick Children.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis forward Pavol Demitra got the Lady Byng Trophy for
gentlemanly play.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr, Yzerman and Pronger made the 2000 All-Star Team, along
with Detroit winger Brendan Shanahan and Red Wings defenseman
Nicklas Lidstrom, and Washington goalie Olaf Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Turek of St. Louis, not Kolzig, was the Jennings Trophy
winner for lowest goals-against average. And Florida's Pavel Bure
received the Maurice Richard Trophy for most goals.

<HEADLINE> Cirillo Negotiating With Rockies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Rockies are moving deliberately as
they attempt to sign third baseman Jeff Cirillo to a long-term
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a report that said Cirillo and the Rockies are on the
verge of a deal, Colorado assistant general manager Josh Byrnes
said Thursday that an agreement is not imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we are close, but obviously the desire is there
on both sides,'' Byrnes said. ''Length of the contract is an issue.
He has made it clear that he doesn't want this contract thing
hanging over his head, but we also don't want to rush into a deal
of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo, acquired from Milwaukee in a four-team, nine-player
trade in December, is under contract through 2001 but has the
option of demanding a deal after the World Series because he was
traded during a multiyear contract. Colorado would have until March
15, 2001, to make a deal, or would risk Cirillo opting to become a
free agent on that date.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting .323 with four homers and 39 RBIs, Cirillo is scheduled
to make $3.6 million this year and $4.5 million in 2001. He
reportedly is seeking a deal that would pay him $7 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo's agent Rick Thurmond did not return telephone messages
Thursday, and Cirillo has said he will not discuss negotiations
until something is finalized.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that Cirillo wants a five-year deal, while the
Rockies are offering four years with a club option in 2006.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador in Peru Clarifies Remark  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The United States still considers Peru's
presidential election ''profoundly defective,'' U.S. Ambassador
John Hamilton said late Thursday, clarifying comments he made
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   President Alberto Fujimori was re-elected for a third, five-year
term May 28 after his challenger dropped out, claiming the
balloting was tainted.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we have said repeatedly, we continue to consider the
elections profoundly defective. The electoral process did not meet
international standards of transparency and democracy,'' Hamilton
said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton told reporters at a trade show earlier Thursday that
Washington would respect the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it is the position of our government to respect the
decisions of national authorities and our expectation, of course,
is that the president will be sworn in on July 28,'' he told the
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   That comment appeared to represent a shift from the stated U.S.
position -- that it would reserve judgment on the validity of
Fujimori's victory.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton's later clarification reaffirmed that the Clinton
administration still did not accept the victory.
</P>
<P>
   In his clarification, he said Washington will decide whether to
recognize Fujimori's win after it sees how he responds to a mission
from the Organization of American States, which is due to arrive
here at the end of the month to work on strengthening Peru's
democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration has said it has not ruled out
sanctions against Peru after the OAS rebuffed Washington's call to
question Fujimori's victory and consider collective action against
the Andean nation.
</P>
<P>
   Former presidential candidate Alejandro Toledo boycotted the May
28 presidential runoff, saying it was rigged, and has vowed to
prevent Fujimori's inauguration before Congress with massive street
protests.
</P>
<P>
   During his 10-year presidency, Fujimori has become Washington's
strongest regional ally in fighting narcotics trafficking. Peru
currently receives $177 million in military, anti-narcotics and
humanitarian aid, according to the U.S. Embassy in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   But relations with the authoritarian leader were strained by an
election campaign riddled with irregularities and allegations of
government fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation from the OAS refused to monitor the May 28 vote,
saying the election was ''far from what could be considered free or
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The OAS agreed to send its secretary general, Cesar Gaviria, and
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy to Peru to work
with Fujimori's government to improve its democratic institutions.
They are scheduled to arrive June 27.

<HEADLINE> Chris Webber's Father Testifies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- The father of ex-Michigan basketball
star Chris Webber has testified before a federal grand jury
investigating alleged gambling activities of Ed Martin, a former
Wolverines booster.
</P>
<P>
   Mayce Webber testified Wednesday, said lawyer Fallasha Erwin,
who represents father and son.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin told The Ann Arbor News that Chris Webber, now with the
Sacramento Kings, likely will appear before the grand jury later
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin would not elaborate on what Mayce Webber said before the
grand jury. Such testimony is sealed from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 66, is accused of running a gambling ring at Detroit
area auto plants.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents and Internal Revenue Service officials also are
interested in whether Martin gave money and gifts to Michigan
basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA could impose sanctions against the school under its
extra benefits rule if it is proven that players took large sums of
money from Martin and if Michigan coaches knew about gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had a long relationship with the Webbers, dating to Chris
Webber's time in junior high school, according to Michigan's 1997
internal investigation of Martin's involvement with the basketball
program.
</P>
<P>
   Webber played the 1991-92 and 1992-93 seasons at Michigan before
turning pro after his sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a plea deal reached in March between Martin, son
Carlton and federal prosecutors was scrapped, meaning Martin could
face an indictment in a gambling and income-tax case.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea deal, Martin had agreed to detail his involvement
with the team in exchange for a reduced sentence of no more than 15
months in jail on one count each of gambling and tax evasion that
carried possible five-year sentences on each count.
</P>
<P>
   Former Michigan player Robert Traylor, now with the Milwaukee
Bucks, also has testified to grand jurors in the Martin case.
Ex-Wolverine Louis Bullock also was subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Other former Michigan players reportedly have been interviewed
by investigators in the past year. They include Jalen Rose of the
Indiana Pacers and Maurice Taylor of the Los Angeles Clippers.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Seeks Congo Peacekeepers  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. envoy to Congo asked the Security
Council on Thursday to send 250 peacekeepers to a Congolese city to
fill a void left by the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan forces.
</P>
<P>
   Kamel Morjane said his appeal was a ''specific and exceptional
measure'' to allow U.N. peacekeepers to provide security after the
pullout of the two rival armies, which turned their guns on each
other in the city of Kisangani earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any vacuum could be very dangerous, especially for the future
of the whole process -- not only for Kisangani,'' Morjane told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda entered Congo's war nearly two years ago, as
allies supporting rebels who wanted to topple President Laurent
Kabila from power. They say they are in Congo to protect their
borders from their own rebels, which they say have used Congo as a
base.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came as the council hosted Congo's warring parties
at the start of a two-day meeting originally meant to move the
country's peace process forward. Instead, the focus has turned to
negotiations over keeping the peace in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no excuse for what happened in Kisangani,'' U.S.
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke told the council, which included the
foreign ministers of Rwanda, Uganda and Congo -- as well as
representatives from the country's main rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Rwandan and Ugandan forces fought pitched
battles in Kisangani, even after agreeing to U.N. cease-fires and a
withdrawal from the strategic city. The fighting left as many as
300 people dead, U.N. officials and diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting ended Sunday after Rwandan forces drove the
Ugandans out of the city's northern sector and let unarmed U.N.
military observers deploy between the two former allies.
</P>
<P>
   Morjane said even 200 more observers couldn't maintain security
in Kisangani and that a full-fledged battalion of armed
peacekeepers -- of about 700 soldiers -- would be required for the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the difficulty in rounding up troop contributions, he
appealed for at least two companies of about 120 soldiers apiece to
be sent to Kisangani quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from the 15-member council noted that a significant
troop increase for Kisangani had been envisaged previously.
However, a draft resolution being negotiated on the sidelines of
the two-day Congo meetings wouldn't contain any new mandate
requirements for the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   The council already considering a draft resolution demanding
that Rwanda and Uganda immediately withdraw from Kisangani and
eventually from the rest of the country, and for other foreign
forces to also leave. Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have backed
Kabila in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   France, which holds the presidency of the Security Council this
month and is hosting the Congo parties, hopes the resolution will
be adopted by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of the foreign forces from Congo is supposed to
be supervised by a 5,537-strong U.N. force of observers and troops
to protect them. So far, just 228 members of the force have been
deployed in Congo and in liaison offices in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   In a report earlier this week, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
none of the conditions had been met for the U.N. deployment to go
ahead.

<HEADLINE> CHRO to investigate Virginia prison  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Members of the state Commission on Human
Rights and Opportunities voted Thursday to investigate allegations
that Connecticut inmates held at a Virginia prison have been
subjected to mistreatment and racism.
</P>
<P>
   In an official complaint to be filed with the Connecticut
Department of Corrections, the CHRO said it would investigate
allegations that the overwhelmingly white prison staff has hurled
racial insults at inmates, beat them, and denied access to lawyers
and religious services.
</P>
<P>
   The probe could include a visit to Wallens Ridge prison and the
issuing of subpoenas, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is one of courage,'' said Roger Vann, a commissioner
who is also president of the state chapter of the NAACP. ''We as an
agency need to stand up for human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also voted to force Virginia officials to comply
with Connecticut's contract compliance laws if the prison transfer
contract is renewed.
</P>
<P>
   CHRO staff last fall had approved the exemption from
Connecticut's contract compliance laws, saying the move was routine
for an out of state service. But one commissioner, Benjamin Rhodes,
said the exemption approval appeared to be done in a ''hush-hush''
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Those laws would require Virginia authorities to send reports on
the racial makeup of its staff to Connecticut officials.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Andrew Norton, sided with a staff report that said
an investigation would be premature. He said reports of
discrimination have not been substantiated, and that allegations of
mistreatment frequently arise in prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The worst incident, he said, involved the suicide in April of
David Tracy, a white prisoner. That happened just weeks after three
Connecticut inmates were wounded by guards who shot them with
rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the inmates, including Tracy's siblings, spoke
against the prison before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the commission heard evidence from Connecticut
Corrections Commissioner John Armstrong, who said the racial makeup
of the prisoner group sent to Wallens Ridge, reflected the racial
makeup of Connecticut's overall prison population.
</P>
<P>
   Correction Department spokeswoman Capt. Heather Ziemba said the
department would cooperate with the CHRO investigation. But she
said some of the issues being raised were answered by Armstrong
during his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the commissioner put it very well when he explained
that the pool of possible staff down there are limited as far as
racial diversity because of the nature of the people that live in
the area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Pagani, Gov. John G. Rowland's spokesman, said CHRO was
entitled to conduct its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Connecticut Department of Corrections regularly monitors
conditions at the Wallens Ridge facility and feels that the
facility meets all standards,'' Pagani said. ''The commissioner of
corrections would never have signed a contract if he had any
question in his mind that the inmates would be put at risk in any
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach officials with the Virginia Department of
Corrections were not successful. Messages were left for department
spokesman Larry Traylor at his home and office.

<HEADLINE> Vermont bank robber may have headed to New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORTH BENNINGTON, Vt. (AP) - An armed man robbed a bank early
Wednesday and fled, possibly toward New York.
</P>
<P>
   The robbery at Merchants Bank took place at 1 p.m. Vermont State
Police and Bennington officers were looking for a white male about
5 feet 10 inches, who was wearing light blue clothing, wire glasses
and a homemade mask.
</P>
<P>
   During the holdup the suspect displayed a gun, later described
as a semiautomatic weapon, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Using a hat found at the scene and believed worn by the bandit,
a police dog tracked the trail to a railroad bed that heads west
toward New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bennington Police Department officials did not release
information on how much money, if any, was taken.
</P>
<P>
   There had been no arrest as of 10 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bennington is 34 miles northeast of Albany.

<HEADLINE> 4 More Arrested in NYC Park Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Four more men were arrested Thursday in the
attacks on women who were stripped and groped in Central Park last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said they now believe the attacks may have
involved as many as 60 men. Previously, they had put the number at
about 40.
</P>
<P>
   The number of possible victims has risen from 24 to 32 as more
women have come forward.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests Thursday brought the total number of men charged to
six, and Police Commissioner Howard Safir said more arrests are
expected. Safir said the men will probably be charged with sexual
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, speaking on WCBS-AM news radio Thursday
evening, said he plans to propose legislation making gang sexual
assault a felony punishable by 3 to 5 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrests came after police distributed photographs
Wednesday of seven men believed to have been part of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said police are scanning videotapes
detectives have received from TV stations and private citizens,
hoping to identify more suspects in the attacks. Some of the
victims were stripped and fondled, while others were robbed.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 tips have been made to a telephone tip line, Safir
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least four victims have said police officers rebuffed them
when they asked for help. The department has opened an internal
investigation.

More Than 170 Arrested in Heroin Bust
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents made more than 170 arrests today as they
broke up a multimillion-dollar Mexican heroin ring alleged to have smuggled
unusually pure and cheap black tar heroin into new markets from one U.S. coast
to the other. The gang, based in the Nayarit state of Mexico, was distributing
80 pounds of heroin each month, worth more than $7 million, in 22 U.S. cities,
said Joe Keefe, chief of special operations for the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The ring was marketing the heroin at such a high level of purity
and such a low price that the Mexicans pushed into eastern U.S. markets formerly
served by Colombian drug traffickers, Keefe said in an interview.

   DRAKE, Colo. (AP) -- Blowtorch winds gusting to 60 mph whipped up two
wildfires and sent flames racing today, forcing firefighters to retreat and
driving hundreds more people from their homes in the foothills outside Denver.
More than 200 National Guardsmen were called in to join the 1,500 firefighters
already battling the two blazes. The fires have burned nearly 15,000 acres and
destroyed about 50 structures, mostly homes, since Monday. Before the flareup
today, about 800 people had been evacuated.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Takes Lead at U.S. Open  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- In thick, soupy fog that slowly
crept across Pebble Beach, Tiger Woods made it perfectly clear why
he is the man to beat in the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Woods made the toughest test in golf look like a casual stroll
along the seaside with the lowest score ever for a U.S. Open at
Pebble Beach, a 6-under 65 that gave him a one-stroke lead over
Miguel Angel Jimenez in the first round Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He also sent a powerful message to the rest of the field: Catch
me if you can.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a lot easier to play from a spot near the lead
than it is when you're that far behind,'' Woods said. ''I'd much
rather have the lead than try to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago at Pebble Beach, Woods stormed from seven
strokes behind on his final seven holes to win the National Pro-Am.
The view from the first round was much better, even if he could
barely make out the green from 200 yards away in the white shroud
of fog.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always called this 'June Gloom' because the fog always
rolls in,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   It could be ''June Doom'' for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly was for John Daly, who withdrew after taking a 14
on the last hole for an 83.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, just 3 over on the day, hit one ball out of bounds, three
in the ocean, hit a left-handed shot from against the sea wall in
the bunker and walked off the course without talking.
</P>
<P>
   The first round was suspended with 75 of the 156 players still
on the course as the fog reduced visibility to about 100 yards.
They will return at 6:45 a.m. PDT on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among those still on the course was Nick Faldo, a three-time
Masters and British Open champion who hasn't won in more than three
years. With five birdies and an eagle on his first 12 holes, Faldo
was at 4 under.
</P>
<P>
   Two former U.S. Open champions -- Corey Pavin and 55-year-old
Hale Irwin -- were at 3 under, along with Loren Roberts, who lost in
a three-way Open playoff at Oakmont in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, playing in his 44th consecutive Open, was 2 over
through eight holes.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez, whom Woods beat in a playoff at Valderrama in November,
made three straight birdies on the front nine and finished with an
18-foot birdie putt for a 5-under 66.
</P>
<P>
   That victory in Spain was among the six in a row by Woods. He
has set himself apart from his peers in the past year, with 11
victories in his last 20 PGA Tour events and finishing out of the
top 10 just twice in his last 25 tournaments worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, he played with few flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a lot of crucial putts, and you have to do that in a
U.S. Open,'' said Woods, who spent two hours working on his stroke
late Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   John Huston took advantage of being in the second group off,
when sunshine bathed Pebble Beach with only a fresh breeze. He had
a 4-under 67, his best start ever in a U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Right behind was Bobby Clampett, who knows Pebble better than
anyone else, having grown up on the Monterey Peninsula. In his
first U.S. Open since 1986, in his first tournament of the year,
Clampett birdied four of the first 10 holes and finished with a 68.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you believe this?'' Clampett said. ''It was extremely
emotional for me. At times out there, I was fighting off the
tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as amazing as Woods' 65 was the fact he made no bogeys, a
rarity in any U.S. Open. Woods saved par from 15 feet on the 11th,
made a 10-footer on the hourglass green at No. 17, and got
up-and-down four other times for par.
</P>
<P>
   The fog kept the greens from getting too crusty and the wind was
moderate at best. Clearly, this was the day for scoring. But as so
many others found out, the U.S. Open is never a championship to
attack at will.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton, who holed an 8-iron from 136 yards for eagle on
opening hole, was at 6 under until he missed the green left on the
par-5 14th and paid dearly.
</P>
<P>
   His chip from spinach-like rough went over the pin, down the
slope and off the front of the green. He failed to get up-and-down
and finished off his round of 69 with another bogey on the 18th
when he hit into the rough off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the fog, he didn't realize he was in the rough until
he got there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I elected to hit 3-iron to where I could see,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson, the runner-up at Pinehurst No. 2 a year ago, got
off to a rocky start but made birdies on three of his last six
holes for an even-par 71, along with England's Lee Westwood, Paul
Azinger and Tom Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was that fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval had a 40 on the back nine with bogeys on both par 5s
and had a 75. Jeff Sluman, the runner-up at Pebble Beach in the '92
Open, had a 78.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one was willing to concede to Woods quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''He put up a very good score,'' said Sergio Garcia, who wore
knickers to honor the late Payne Stewart and had a 75. ''But if you
shoot 1 or 2 under, he could struggle very easily on this course.
You can go 2 or 3 over just like that.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tournament is not over,'' the 20-year-old Spaniard said.
''It just started.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods hasn't shown much capacity to struggle anywhere, much less
Pebble Beach. On his last competitive round on the spectacular
course along the rugged California coastline, he had a 64 to cap
off his thrilling comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Woods immediately thrust himself into the thick of the
championship with a tap-in birdie on No. 4 and a 15-foot birdie
putt on the dangerous par-3 seventh hole. He made another nice save
from the thick collar around the eighth green, lofting a chip to a
foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anyone is trying to catch me,'' Woods said.
''Everyone is trying to set themselves up for a nice little run on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, that might not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Told that his 65 was a U.S. Open record at Pebble Beach -- Gil
Morgan had a 6-under 66 in 1992 -- Woods shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I do it four straight days, it would be pretty good,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The last player to win the U.S. Open after leading the first day
was Stewart, who went on to defeat Scott Simpson in 1991 at
Hazeltine.

<HEADLINE> Native Americans Debate Mascots  </HEADLINE>
By NIALA BOODHOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Jim Billie, a chief of the Seminole
tribe, upset some other American Indians on Thursday when he said
he didn't care if the mascot for Florida State University was named
after his people.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does not affect us,'' Billie said, joking that he thought
FSU stood for ''fat, short and ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   American Indian activists and others complain the mascots are
derogatory, which has led to a growing national trend among
schools, universities and professional teams to shed the nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are we prostituting our culture?'' asked Navajo Times editor
Tom Arbiso, who led the discussion as part the Native American
Journalist Association's annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State has faced pressure to give up its nickname. At
football games, a student clad in traditional Indian costume,
including headdress and war paint, rides around the field on a
horse.
</P>
<P>
   But Billie said the tribe has never considered the university's
nickname offensive, adding he thought the school chose the name
because the Seminole tribe was never defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Billie said they do not receive any money from the school for
use of the name.
</P>
<P>
   Indians should be united on the issue over the use of their
names for sports teams, Navajo Times journalist Eugene Tapahe told
Billie.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can't be they, or them, it has to be all of us,'' Tapahe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people eat bear, some don't,'' Billie replied, inviting
those who disagreed to present their case at a Seminole tribe
meeting. ''I stay away from your culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapahe also spoke about his experiences with the NFL's
Washington Redskins, saying the etymology of the word referred to a
time when bounty hunters presented skins of Indians for money. The
team's federal trademark protection was revoked last year, after it
was decided the team's name may disparage American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about whether he thought the nickname ''Redskins''
was offensive, Billie refused to capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm Seminole,'' Billie said. ''Red is not an insulting color
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Pinellas County school district decided to
consider whether to stop using Indian names for sports team mascots
after complaints of insensitivity from activists.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools have already changed names.
</P>
<P>
   The St. John's Redmen are now the Red Storm and Stanford fans
cheer for the Cardinal instead of the Indians. Miami of Ohio has
also changed its nickname from the Redskins to the RedHawks.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Betty Lennox scored a career-high 25 points
and Katie Smith had 24 as the Minnesota Lynx beat the Orlando
Miracle 72-66 on Thursday night to extend their winning streak to a
franchise-record four games.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Tate added 13 points for Minnesota, which scored 23 points
off 24 Orlando turnovers. Smith shot 12-for-12 from the foul line
to set a franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   Nykesha Sales scored 23 points, including a four-point play, and
Adrienne Johnson added 20 for the Miracle. Cintia dos Santos had a
career-high 11 rebounds for Orlando, which had won two straight.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota shot just 34.9 from the field to Orlando's 46.3.
</P>
<P>
   After the teams traded baskets for the first six minutes of the
second half, the Lynx outscored the Miracle 17-9 to take a 56-46
lead with 6:42 left. Orlando did not get closer than four points
the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando shot 52.2 percent in the first half and Minnesota shot
just 29.7 percent, but the Lynx led 32-31 at the break. The
difference was that Minnesota shot 8-for-8 at the foul line and
forced 16 Miracle turnovers.

<HEADLINE> Serb Opposition Leader Wounded  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Controversial Serb opposition leader
Vuk Draskovic was slightly wounded early Friday during an attack by
an unknown assailant, the independent Beta news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred shortly after midnight at Draskovic's
vacation home in the Montenegran coastal town of Budva, Beta said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior party official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press that one bullet struck Draskovic in the
ear while another grazed his temple.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the Draskovic home was ''peppered with
bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Draskovic's Serbian Renewal Movement said the
attackers ''sprayed machine gun fire'' on his house in a ''new
assassination attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb leader was taken to a hospital in the town of Kotor, 22
miles southwest of the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica. A nurse on
duty, who declined to give her name, said Draskovic was released
after receiving treatment for ''bullet injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the latest in a series of attacks against
prominent figures in Yugoslavia. On May 31, Goran Zugic, the
national security adviser to Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic,
was gunned down in front of his home in Podgorica.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Serbia's most infamous warlord Zeljko Raznatovic,
known as Arkan, was murdered in Belgrade. One month later, Defense
Minister Pavle Bulatovic was shot dead in a restaurant in the
Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 3, Draskovic survived a automobile accident in which
three members of his party, including his brother-in-law, were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic himself suffered only minor injuries but called the
incident an assassination attempt.
</P>

<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook southern Japan Thursday
night, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.7-magnitude temblor was centered in the Pacific sea bed
east of Amami Oshima island, about 800 miles southwest of Tokyo,
the Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no danger of tsunami, powerful waves stirred up by
undersea disturbances such as earthquakes, it said.
</P>
<P>
   A magnitude 5-level quake can cause damage to homes if it occurs
in a residential area. Japan is one of the world's most
earthquake-prone countries.

<HEADLINE> Tighter Pollution Rules Considered  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Southern California will decide Friday
whether nearly 11,000 transit buses and garbage trucks must convert
to cleaner-burning alternative fuels -- a move that could lead to
similar requirements across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see a sea of clean-fuel vehicles in California and
around the country'' if the rules are passed, said Gail Ruderman
Feuer of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, believed to be the first of its kind in the
nation, every new vehicle purchased by public fleet operators will
have to run on alternative fuels -- natural gas, methanol,
electricity or fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are the first phase of a change, to take effect over
two years, that could ultimately affect 120,000 public and private
vehicles in Southern California from airport taxis to school buses.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say it will give a boost to the alternative-fuel
industry and force automakers to build more vehicles operating on
such fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Diesel Corp., which builds about a third of the engines
for heavy-duty trucks in the United States, already manufactures
compressed natural gas engines, said John Duerr, manager of
regulatory activities.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Southern California plan, while important, would
probably not force Detroit Diesel and other manufacturers to change
direction, since many are already building engines for alternative
fuels.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation will cover government agencies from the city to
the federal level, universities and transit agencies in Los
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, affecting
3,700 transit buses and 7,200 garbage trucks, said Bill Kelly, a
spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District,
which devised the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Only newly purchased vehicles would be affected. Fleets could
continue to operate existing diesel buses and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, which will be voted on by the air quality district's
board Friday, would also require public agencies in Southern
California to buy passenger cars with the lowest emissions on the
market, eventually covering 86,000 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   School buses are not included in this first stage, but the air
quality agency is expected to deal with them in August. Other
proposals will target heavy-duty public vehicles, street sweepers,
and taxis and shuttles that serve airports.
</P>
<P>
   California's smog problems led Congress to make the state the
only one that can set air-quality standards more stringent than
Washington's. But once California sets its stricter standards,
other states are free to adopt them, too, and some have done so in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and the staff of the air quality agency say
the proposal is a step toward getting the state off diesel fuel,
which an agency study found is responsible for more than 70 percent
of toxic substances in the air of the smog-plagued Los Angeles
basin. One of every 1,000 cancer cases in the region can be
attributed to diesel toxins, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   The higher cost and limited availability of the fuels have some
worried, though. And the petroleum industry said there should be a
place for cleaner-burning diesel in the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basic question of why can't we meet your standards with
our fuel is one that begs for an answer,'' said Scott Macdonald, a
spokesman for the oil industry-financed South Coast Clean Air
Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald said natural gas has its own environmental problems,
producing more greenhouse gases than diesel.
</P>
<P>
   Making the switch to natural gas isn't as difficult as some
operators might think, said Alberto Guardado, operations manager
for Waste Management's Palm Desert fleet, which has used garbage
trucks with compressed natural gas for about four years.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cromwell III, general manager of Sunline Transit Agency
in Thousand Palms, estimates he will save $200,000 a year by
converting his 100-vehicle fleet of buses and other vehicles to
compressed natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The natural gas buses cost about $350,000, about $50,000 more
than their diesel equivalents, he said. But savings kick in because
the fuel is cheaper and the buses require less maintenance, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal gets howitzer deal from Navy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATERVLIET, N.Y. (AP) - The nation's oldest active maker of big
guns has won a multimillion dollar contract from the U.S. Navy to
build more than 700 howitzers over the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The Watervliet Arsenal faced an uncertain future and potential
job cuts before the contract to produce 723, 155mm cannons was
awarded. By winning the contract, as many as 139 jobs will be
retained, U.S. Sen. Charles E. Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   The contract to build the 723 guns is worth about $1 billion but
a spokesman for Schumer said the arsenal's portion of the job would
be worth ''in the tens of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The arsenal built during the War of 1812 employs about 670
people. It competed against an arsenal in Kentucky to win the bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without this contract, the arsenal would not have survived,''
Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an important first step in building a bright future
for the Watervliet Arsenal,'' said U.S. Rep. Michael McNulty,
D-Green Island. ''Hopefully, this will be followed by good news
with regard to the joint venture by General Dynamics, United
Defense Limited Partnership and British Aerospace.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, those three defense companies made an unsolicited
proposal to take over the gun plant. Army officials have begun
negotiations with the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The arsenal had about 4,000 workers in 1989. Because the arsenal
isn't supported with tax dollars, it must survive on what it sells
- and the country isn't using as many big guns as it used to.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the guns made there are currently sold to allies.
Work orders there have dropped from $164 million in 1994 to about
$86 million in 1998.

<HEADLINE> John Daly Withdraws From US Open  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- John Daly blew up again in the U.S.
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Daly shot a 14 on the par-5 18th hole Thursday at Pebble Beach,
hitting one shot into a backyard and dumping three more in the
Pacific Ocean. He stormed off the course with a 12-over 83 and
withdrew from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing how quickly it went,'' said Daly's caddie, former
NHL player Dan Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   The meltdown occurred a year after he led the Open through most
of the first round at Pinehurst, N.C., only to shoot a
septuple-bogey 11 on the eighth hole in the final round. He
actually hit a putt while it was still rolling, drawing a two-shot
penalty, and finished with an 83 and a 29-over 309 to rank last
among players making the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he blasted the U.S. Golf Association and vowed never
to play in another Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''The USGA loves to embarrass guys who play in their
tournaments,'' Daly said. ''I don't consider the U.S. Open a major
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly, a two-time major winner whose career has been plagued by
alcoholism and gambling problems, apologized a few days later and
returned to the Open this year at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was real excited,'' said Quinn, who filled in after Daly's
regular caddie hurt an ankle. ''It was fun through 16 or 17 holes.
He was playing good. He just got all beat up at the end. One little
swing and it was like, 'Oh, my God.'''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a bogey at 17, Daly went to the final hole a
respectable 3-over for the round. But his tee shot scooted under a
fence and into the backyard of a home that borders the right side
of the fairway on the picturesque 18th.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing his ball was out of bounds, Daly trudged back to
the tee and hit two more shots -- both hooking into the crashing
waves of Carmel Bay. He then pulled a 5-iron out of the bag and
laid up safely with his seventh shot of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Another layup left him only 115 yards from the green, but Daly
plopped his ninth shot into the water again. Forced to drop in the
bunker, the ball wound up against the seawall and he took a
left-handed swing at his next shot, No. 10 for those counting. The
ball remained in the bunker while the crowd groaned.
</P>
<P>
   Daly finally blasted out of the sand, two-putted for the 14,
quickly signed his scorecard and headed for the locker room without
commenting. By the time reporters reached the building, he already
had collected his belongings and left.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is always unfortunate when a contestant withdraws prior to
completion of his regulation rounds,'' said Marty Parkes, spokesman
for the USGA. ''We are very sorry that John's struggles at the end
of his round today caused him to withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly's fellow players took the news in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surprise,'' Jack Nicklaus said sarcastically. ''No one knows
what is going on through his mind. I like John. He's a fun guy to
be around. But, obviously, he's his own worst enemy. He's not going
to get better until he gets those demons out of his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Appleby wasn't very sympathetic, either.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he forgot that you're trying to get the least amount
of shots on a hole, not the most,'' Appleby said. ''I don't
understand what he has to keep doing that to himself. He's not
doing it to anyone else. He needs to be a bit kinder to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the worst hole for Daly in tournament golf. In March
1988, he hit a 3-wood into the water six times in the final round
of Bay Hill Invitational, taking an 18 on the par-5 sixth hole.
</P>
<P>
   After the latest blowup, Greg Norman called Daly ''too good a
player to do that to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He still had a very good chance to win the tournament,''
Norman said. ''It's unfortunate. But he's in his own skin. He makes
his own decisions and he has to go with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly, who won the PGA Championship in 1991 and the British Open
four years later, withdrew from the 1997 Open after 27 holes
because he had the shakes from trying to give up alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, three months after his troubles at Pinehurst, he
was dropped by his top sponsor, Callaway Golf. The company said he
had resumed drinking and gambling, and tore up his contract when he
refused help.
</P>
<P>
   Now, another disastrous entry on Long John's scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel bad for the kid,'' said Quinn, who was trying to line
up a late-night flight home to Pittsburgh. ''He's a great guy. He's
so talented.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Empress dowager Nagako, the elderly widow of
Japan's late Emperor Hirohito, fell into a coma Friday after
suffering from breathing difficulties, the Imperial Household
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Toshio Yuasa, vice grand steward of the Imperial Household, said
Nagako, 97, fell into a coma Friday morning after her blood
pressure dropped. She had been suffering from breathing problems
since early Thursday and was using an oxygen mask.
</P>
<P>
   Nagako was being treated at a medical facility on the grounds of
the Imperial Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed Emperor Akihito, Nagako's eldest son,
Empress Michiko, Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako
arriving at the building where she was being treated.
</P>
<P>
   Nagako married Hirohito in 1924, and they had seven children.
Hirohito, who began his reign in 1926, died on January 7, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Nagako became Japan's longest-living empress dowager in 1995,
surpassing Empress Kanshi, who died in 1127.

the nearby city of Hanover, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst August had accompanied Caroline, her brother Albert and
their father, Prince Rainier of Monaco, earlier Thursday during a

<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - Four men have accused Utica Mayor Ed Hanna of
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The men, two former and two current city employees, claim the
78-year-old mayor made unwelcome sexual advances as a term of their
employment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basis of the claims are allegations of sexual harassment
at the work place that was a condition of employment,'' Frank
Policelli, the attorney representing the four men, said Thursday.
''He (Hanna) made unwelcome advances toward all of the men and had
contact with at least one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Policelli filed a notice of claim on Wednesday as a prelude to a
federal lawsuit. When the lawsuit is filed in 30 days, a dollar
amount will be stated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are: Joseph Pouliot, 23, of Holland Patent;
Joseph DiPierro, 22, of Utica; Nathan Newman, 24, of Utica; and
Patrick Van Etten, 35, also of Utica. Pouliot and Newman are still
employed by the city, while three of the four at one time held the
title of assistant to the mayor, Policelli said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were all there (working in the mayor's office) at
different times,'' Policelli said. ''But their testimony will be
substantially the same as far as a pattern of conduct. The office
was used merely as a way of satisfying his sexual desires.''
</P>
<P>
   Policelli said one incident allegedly happened May 16, after one
of the plaintiffs had been on the job for only a week.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was able to record a conversation with the mayor (after the
incident), which helped substantiate his claim,'' Policelli said,
adding that he also had a second tape to use for evidence. ''I
think we've got a pretty strong case.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a scam, loaded with outrageous lies,'' Hanna said in a
statement faxed to local news organizations Wednesday. ''Everything
stated that is damaging and ugly is a fabricated and out-of-context
manipulation, in a cleverly orchestrated conspiracy to extort
money, including political rewards and control.''
</P>
<P>
   Policelli said that during the course of his monthlong
investigation of the alleged incident in May, the other men came
forward on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Policelli said Van Etten was installing a phone one day when the
mayor saw him and decided to make him an assistant mayor. According
to Policelli, when Van Etten refused the mayor's advances he was
assigned to another department and then fired after seven weeks on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said in a deposition that Hanna invited him to his home
on several occasions, asked him questions about his sexual
practices, and invited him to watch a pornographic movie.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was re-elected to his fourth - and final - four-year
term in November. Term limits set the maximum number of times a
person can hold the office.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna, who also served in the state Legislature in the 1950s and
again in 1966 after winning election to a special one-year term,
has been no stranger to controversy in his long and colorful
political career.
</P>
<P>
   After he was first elected Utica mayor in 1973, he removed his
office door to so he would be more accessible to the people. He
later had it reinstalled.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna, who once served as state Parks Commissioner, also tried
to fire the entire Public Works Department during a labor dispute,
and at one point was arrested by a police chief he tried to fire
after he broke into the chief's office.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna also announced plans to run for the U.S. Senate in 1976,
mayor of Utica in 1979, and state Assembly in 1980 before
withdrawing from each race.
</P>
<P>
   A high school dropout and World War II combat Marine, Hanna made
a fortune in the photochemical industry before entering politics.
His erratic style has made him the subject of several national
magazine and newspaper articles.

Isle of Capri's fourth quarter earnings beat Wall Street estimates,

AP Business Writer:
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - Isle of Capri Casinos Inc. announced
Thursday that its fourth-quarter earnings more than doubled from a
year ago, beating Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Isle of Capri earned $14 million, or 44 cents per share,
compared with $6.4 million in the same period a year ago, an
increase of 118 percent. Wall Street had projected a profit of
around 39 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   ''The numbers were excellent,'' said Dennis Forst, an analyst
with McDonald Investments Inc. ''I was surprised that at almost
every property, revenues and cash flow were moderately better than
I had been forecasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors responded by bidding up Isle of Capri stock. The
company's shares finished 31 cents higher at $17.25 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The company operates 11 casinos in Mississippi, Louisiana,
Colorado and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, it closed on its purchase of the Kansas City
Flamingo Hilton Riverboat. The Biloxi-based company also wrapped up
deals to acquire Lady Luck Gaming Corp. and Davis Gaming in
Boonville, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to these acquisitions, along with the
stability of our existing Isle properties, to be the engine that
drives the future growth of Isle of Capri,'' said Bernard
Goldstein, company chairman and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Charles and Bossier City, La. led the company's 11
properties in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Davila, an analyst with Hibernia Southcoast Capital in
New Orleans, said the company's push to add more hotel rooms has
propelled the growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have been able to sustain their growth in virtually every
market they're in, not the least of which is being able to hold
their own in Biloxi,'' Davila said. ''The Lake Charles and Bossier
City markets are thriving and they're taking their disproportionate
share of those markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Isle's Louisiana casino revenue for the quarter totaled $96.5
million, or 41 percent of its quarterly revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, all of its casinos posted steady gains in
revenue, including Biloxi which increased to $25.2 million for the
quarter, a gain of 65 percent compared to the same time a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Vicksburg, Isle's casino boasted revenue of $18.2 million, up
from $6.1 million the same time a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to give them credit for better management,'' Forst
said.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela State Low on Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A Venezuelan state devastated by
mudslides in December must freeze its reconstruction efforts due to
insufficient funding, the state's governor said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on local radio, Alfredo Laya said his state government
had ''collapsed'' from lack of money from the central government.
</P>
<P>
   The statement came six months after the Dec. 15 disaster, in
which intense rains sent avalanches of earth, rocks and water onto
northern coastal towns along the Caribbean Sea, killing thousands
of people.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Vargas bore the brunt of the damage. Government
figures released this week revealed that 15,000 people in Vargas
disappeared in the slides, and are presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Caracas Thursday, President Hugo Chavez
defended the government's progress in Vargas and disputed Laya's
claim that there were insufficient resources to continue
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not let this (the rebuilding) stop,'' Chavez said,
adding that it's been ''impossible'' to work with Laya or ''to
coordinate any type of action.'' Laya's political party, Fatherland
For All, recently broke away from Chavez's leftist governing
coalition in a highly publicized dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said most inhabitants of Vargas already have access to
schools, sports fields, ample food and medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Laya said the construction stoppage would leave 10,000 people in

<HEADLINE> Blues' Pronger MVP, Top Defenseman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Chris Pronger was a triple winner Thursday night,
taking home NHL awards as the most valuable player and top
defenseman and making the All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Blues star is the first defenseman since Bobby Orr
in 1972 to win the Hart Memorial Trophy. He got the MVP honors by
just one point in the closest balloting in the award's history,
beating out scoring champion Jaromir Jagr and top goal scorer Pavel
Bure. Pronger had 396 points, Jagr 395.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger, at 25 the youngest winner of the Norris in 15 years,
succeeded teammate Al MacInnis. They are the only two Blues to win
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''A special thanks to Al MacInnis, who helped guide my career
when it looked like it was going nowhere,'' said Pronger, who led
the league in plus-minus raings at plus-52.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Jagr, and Detroit's Steve Yzerman joined Pronger on
the 2000 All-Star team, along with Detroit winger Brendan Shanahan
and Red Wings defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom, and Washington goalie
Olaf Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig was selected as the NHL's best goaltender, winning the
Vezina Trophy. But Roman Turek of St. Louis was the Jennings Trophy
winner for lowest goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr, who scored 92 points, won his second straight Lester B.
Pearson award from the NHL Players' Association as the top player.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman, whose transformation from sharpshooter to complete
player helped the Detroit Red Wings win the Stanley Cup in 1997 and
1998, won the Selke Trophy as the NHL's best defensive forward.
Yzerman twice scored more than 60 goals in a season, and five times
had more than 50, but Detroit didn't win until he committed equal
effort to both ends of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gomez, who led all first-year players in points and helped
the New Jersey Devils win the Stanley Cup, won the Calder Trophy as
the outstanding rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, 20, the first NHL player from Alaska, had 70 points (19
goals, 51 assists). He was New Jersey's second choice, 27th
overall, in the 1998 draft and moved up from juniors to a regular
spot with the Devils this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an amazing script,'' said Gomez. ''I couldn't have
imagined it any better in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez was given his award by actor Christopher Reeve, who is
paralyzed, and Reeve's 8-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an honor to be up here with Mr. Reeve and his son, he
shows what courage is about,'' said Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez is the second Devil to win the Calder. Goaltender Martin
Brodeur won it in 1994 in voting by members of the Professional
Hockey Writers' Association.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have won the Calder three of the last four years.
Colorado's Chris Drury got it last year and Bryan Berard got it in
1997, when he was with the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Adams Trophy, given by the NHL Broadcaster's Association,
went to Joel Quenneville after he led the Blues to a league-best
51-20-11-1 record. The Blues also allowed a league-low 165 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Ken Daneyko, who has appeared in every one of New
Jersey's postseason games, took the Masterton Trophy for
perserverance and dedication to hockey. Daneyko has overcome an
alchohol problem to appear in 1,000 NHL games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hockey has been the one constant in my life. That's what I'm
most proud of,'' he said. ''I never expected this, but it certainly
caps off a nice year after winning the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto goalie Curtis Joseph was given the King Clancy Memorial
Trophy in honor of his humanitarian work. Joseph started a program
called Cujo's Kids that helps critically ill children at the
Hospital for Sick Children.
</P>
<P>
   Bure received the Maurice Richard Trophy for scoring the most
goals, 58.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis forward Pavol Demitra got the Lady Byng Trophy for
gentlemanly play.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks Activate Stottlemyre  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Todd Stottlemyre, activated from the disabled
list Thursday, gave up a pair of home runs and a double during his
first six pitches in Arizona's game against Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth, playing for the first time since missing 10
games with a strained hamstring, homered to left-center on
Stottlemyre's first pitch of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek doubled two pitches later and Gary Sheffield
followed with a homer to center field on a 1-1 delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre hadn't pitched since May 29 against St. Louis, when
he was forced out of the game after 5 1-3 innings because of
tendinitis in his right elbow and placed on the disabled list for
the fourth time in his 13-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre entered Thursday's game with an 8-3 record and a
4.38 ERA. It was his 21st start since a significant tear in his
rotator cuff last May.
</P>
<P>
   To make room, the Diamondbacks optioned slumping outfielder
Turner Ward to Triple-A Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, 35, hit .173 in 15 games with four RBIs for the
Diamondbacks, his fifth major league team.
</P>
<P>
   After spending two months in the minors last season rehabbing
from an injured right knee, the 11-year veteran switch-hitter was
recalled in September and hit three pinch home runs -- including
two-run shot in Game 3 of the division series against the New York
Mets.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Candidate Withdraws  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- One of Mexico's six presidential candidates
formally withdrew from the race Thursday, throwing his support
behind the leading opposition candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Porfirio Munoz Ledo came as the campaign continued
to heat up ahead of the July 2 election, with opposition candidates
accusing the party that has governed for 71 years of pressuring
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls show Vicente Fox of the opposition National Action
Party and Francisco Labastida of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in one of the tightest races in
Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz Ledo, a former president of both the PRI and the leftist
Democratic Revolution Party, had been the candidate of the small
Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, or PARM.
</P>
<P>
   He had already infuriated that party's leaders by calling for a
united front against the PRI behind Fox and asking prosecutors to
investigate drug allegations against his own party's president.
</P>
<P>
   The Authentic party voted last month to ask him to step down,
and on Thursday he presented a formal resignation to the Federal
Electoral Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz Ledo has agreed to serve on Fox's transition team if the
National Action candidate is elected.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed the Mexican people were ready for change,
and he encouraged PARM supporters to vote for Fox instead. ''If
everyone does this, the Mexican transition would be much easier,
faster and efficient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While officials say the current election will be the fairest in
Mexican history, and the first run by an independent electoral
agency, complaints have mounted about PRI pressure on voters.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the candidate running a distant third, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, said the vote should be annulled if it is not free and
fair. Many Mexicans believe Cardenas was cheated out of the
presidency by widespread fraud in the 1988 election.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, however, rejected the possibility of a second
election, insisting that the system is ''fraud-proof.''
</P>
<P>
   In two states, opposition parties say they have found PRI
warehouses stocked with pre-election gifts such as bicycles and
sewing machines.
</P>
<P>
   Some also have accused the PRI of collecting voting credential
numbers at the same time the government dispenses aid.
</P>
<P>
   Civic Alliance, a nonpartisan group that campaigns for fair
elections, distributed copies of a letter allegedly written by an
official in the southern state of Chiapas ordering government
employees to attend ruling-party campaign rallies and paying for
the bus to get them there.
</P>
<P>
   The government and PRI have repeatedly denied pressuring voters
or offering bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates, Manuel Camacho of the Democratic Center
Party and Gilberto Rincon Gallardo of the Social Democratic Party,
are also contesting the election.

<HEADLINE> Authorities seize drugs from Wyeth distribution center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Federal authorities seized a small
quantity of vaccines and antihistamines Thursday from a
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories' distribution center because of problems
with the way they were made.
</P>
<P>
   The quantity of drugs seized by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration at the company's distribution center in Vonore,
Tenn., would fill less than a pallet, said Doug Petkus, a spokesman
for the Philadelphia-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers supporting a warrant for the seizure said Wyeth's
operations could not assure the drugs met safety requirements in
strength, quality and purity.
</P>
<P>
   Seized were vaccines for tetanus and diphtheria, and two
antihistamines - Dimenhydrinate for motion sickness and Phenergan
to treat allergies.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs were produced at the company's Marietta, Pa.,
facility, which has been ''undergoing substantial improvements for
several months in response to FDA concerns,'' Petkus said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important to note (the plant) ... has not been
manufacturing any product for shipment during that time,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said the company was warned last
year and again after an inspection this year of ''good practice
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories is a division of Madison, N.J.-based
American Home Products.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 2, Braves 0  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Kris Benson pitched a six-hitter for his first
career shutout and drove in the first run with an infield single,
leading the Pittsburgh Pirates past the Atlanta Braves 2-0 Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Benson (5-5), lowering his ERA to 2.08 ERA in his last 10
starts, held the middle of the Braves' order to one hit and
toughened up with runners on base to gain the Pirates a split in
the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Benson outdueled Kevin Millwood (4-6), who made his second start
of the series after lasting only one-third of an inning Monday,
mostly because of his two-out RBI single in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Young started the Pirates' fourth with a double, extending
his hitting streak to 10 games, and Bruce Aven ended a 0-for-15
streak with a single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, winless since May 17, got the next two hitters. But
Benson, with only two hits in 23 at-bats, hit a liner off the
outstretched glove of first baseman Wally Joyner. The ball
deflected to second baseman Quilvio Veras, but Benson easily beat
him to the bag as Young scored the game's first run.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates added a run in the eighth against reliever Bruce
Chen on Brian Giles' leadoff double and Pat Meares' two-out RBI
infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood lost a career-high fourth consecutive decision despite
pitching much better than he did in the Braves' 10-8 victory
Monday, when he was chased after yielding five runs. Millwood had
allowed 14 runs in 4 1-3 innings in his previous two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Benson's previous best outing this season was a three-hitter to
beat St. Louis 3-1 on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had several chances to get to Benson, who allowed two
earned runs or fewer for the eighth time in 10 starts. They had two
on with one out in the sixth, but Benson got Joyner on a flyout and
struck out Brian Jordan for one of his five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Keith Lockhart hit his second double of the game
and pinch-hitter Andres Galarraga was nicked on the forearm by a
pitch, putting runners on first and second with two outs. But Veras
bounded harmlessly into a forceout at second to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' 2-3-4-5 hitters -- Andruw and Chipper Jones, Joyner
and Jordan -- were a combined 1-for-15, with Jones' single in the
eighth as the only hit.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood was the first Braves pitcher since knuckleballer Phil
Niekro in 1980 to start against the same team twice in a series.
Niekro started April 9 and 13, 1980, against Cincinnati, losing
both games.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the game was delayed 55 minutes by rain.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Millwood started because Terry Mulholland had tightness in
his hamstring, delaying his next start until Saturday. ... The
Pirates had lost seven of 11. ... By winning, the Pirates avoided
dropping eight games below .500 for the second time this season.
... Jones' single ran his hitting streak to 13 games (18-for-48,
.375). ... Benson is 5-2 in his last 10 starts and has yielded one
run in 17 innings in his last two starts. ... Young is 16-for-42
(.381) during his hitting streak.

<HEADLINE> LSU 6, Florida St. 3  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- LSU beat Florida State 6-3 Thursday night and
advanced to the College World Series championship game for the
fifth time since 1991, while keeping the Seminoles without a title
in their 18 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers (51-17), who won the four championship game
appearances, will play Stanford on Saturday. The Cardinal beat
Louisiana-Lafayette 19-9 en route to their third title game.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time since 1996 that both teams entered the
championship game undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Cresse snapped an 0-for-9 streak with a double in the
eighth inning and Brad Hawpe went 2-for-3 with two RBIs for LSU.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles haven't won a championship in 18 trips to the CWS,
the most by any team without winning it all. Coach Mike Martin is
0-for-12 at Rosenblatt Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   LSU scored a run in three of the first five innings to take a
3-0 lead, but the Seminoles (53-19) tied the game with a two-run
eighth. The Tigers answered with three runs in the bottom of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Weylin Guidry (1-2) pitched two-thirds of an inning for the win,
while Trey Hodges got the final two outs for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fontenot got LSU's eighth-inning rally started with a
one-out single under a diving Marshall McDougall.
</P>
<P>
   Cresse, hitless with six strikeouts when he stepped to the
plate, drove Blair Varnes' first pitch off the left-field fence.
Cresse raised an arm in the air after the hit, thinking it was a
home run. He settled for a double, and Fontenot stopped at third.
</P>
<P>
   Varnes intentionally walked Hawpe, who provided LSU's first two
runs, to load the bases. Then Varnes hit Blair Barbier, scoring
Fontenot.
</P>
<P>
   Varnes (11-4), who took the loss in last year's title game
against Miami, fell to 0-3 in the CWS. He gave up eight hits and
six runs in 7 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Cedrick Harris singled off reliever Matt Lynch,
scoring Cresse and Hawpe to make it 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles, who stranded 11 runners -- eight in scoring
position -- through seven innings, tied the game with two runs in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   John-Ford Griffin singled up the middle with two outs, scoring
Blair McCaleb and Chris Smith. But Griffin was picked off at first
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles seemed to take the momentum from LSU, which led
for much of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Fontenot drew a walk from Varnes in the first, stole second and
scored on Hawpe's single to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Hawpe led off the third with his third home run in his last five
at-bats and 12th this season. He had two homers in the Tigers' 10-4
win over Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Wright, FSU's No. 9 hitter, homered to right in the fifth,
his fourth homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles, after leaving seven runners on base over the
first five innings, finally got scored in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Jernigan was hit by a pitch to lead off the inning, stole
second and scored on Brett Groves single under the glove of
Barbier.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees Two Cities in One  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton took a tale-of-two-cities
tour of Washington on Thursday and found signs of hope in each.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the poorest neighborhoods, where barbed wire stands
guard around empty lots, Clinton celebrated the growth of an
after-school learning center called the U.S. Dream Academy where
children, some with parents in prison, use the Internet to connect
with knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you do for these children, someone should do for every
child in the United States,'' Clinton told parents, administrators
and some excited but restless youngsters. ''This works.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on to a neighborhood beyond most people's dreams,
and a great stone home where people contributed at least $10,000
each to rub shoulders briefly with him and other luminaries in a
fund-raising event for Mayor Anthony Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love this place,'' Clinton said of the city so many
politicians disparage as the antithesis of real America -- and the
one he will leave when his presidency is over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen it at its best and worst and in between.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking not of his evening's travels in his motorcade
but historically. As a college student here, he witnessed the riots
in the aftermath of Martin Luther King's assassination, a period
followed by many tough years and now at least a tentative sense
that the city is picking up under its low-key Democratic mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The event was held two years before Williams is up for
re-election, at the mansion of Beth Dozoretz, former finance
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Some of the city's
most influential Democratic and Republican political leaders paid
$2,000 and raised at least $8,000 to attend, testifying to
bipartisan support for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Bob Dole, the former Republican senator and
Clinton's opponent in the last presidential election. It was the
second time in a week Dole and Clinton had appeared together at
Democratic fund-raising events; the last was for another Dole
friend, Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, a Washington resident since 1973, said he voted for
Williams' Republican opponent but ''that's all history now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I see a lot of changes for the better now,'' he said, a point
echoed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Dole noted the city has been having a problem with exploding
manhole covers.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Williams raked in some $862,000 and made the large
boast that in the last four months, no one has had to wait more
than 20 minutes at the Department of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Before, he said, ''you had to book a hotel.''

<HEADLINE> White Sox 12, Yankees 3  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Chuck Knoblauch made three more throwing errors
and the Chicago White Sox took advantage, pounding the New York
Yankees 12-3 Thursday night in a matchup of teams with the AL's
best records.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko and Brook Fordyce each had three hits and three
RBIs as Chicago, coming off a three-game sweep at Cleveland, won
for the 13th time in 15 games. Magglio Ordonez added a two-run
homer.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, who have the league's top mark at 41-24, lead the
AL Central by 5{ games -- their biggest edge since the end of the
1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, a Gold Glove winner in 1997, made three errors in a
game for the first time in his career and they led to two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's third error came in the sixth, and when the Yankees
made a pitching change later in the inning, he stood motionless at
his position -- hands on his hips and staring straight ahead. The
other New York infielders gathered behind the mound while the
outfielders talked in dead center.
</P>
<P>
   When the inning ended, Knoblauch trotted in to the dugout and
headed toward a tunnel leading to the clubhouse. He appeared to
motion to manager Joe Torre, who followed him.
</P>
<P>
   Torre came back alone moments later, and Knoblauch left the
game. Knoblauch has missed several games this year because of a
sore left forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a taped scoreboard quiz that was to feature Knoblauch was
scrapped. Instead, one showing Tino Martinez was substituted.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch has 12 errors this season after making a
league-leading 26 last year. Recently, he said he might retire if
his throwing problems persisted.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch became the first Yankees player to make three errors
in a game since third baseman Scott Brosius on Aug. 4, 1998. The
last Yankees second baseman to commit three was Mariano Duncan on
May 1, 1996, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox have made an AL-leading 63 errors, but this time
found a team that had more trouble in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sirotka (6-5) won despite giving up 10 hits in 5 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte (6-3), pitching on his 28th birthday, had won four
straight starts. He also had been 6-0 against the White Sox at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch made a wild throw that did not hurt New York in the
third. Konerko's solo homer in the fourth put Chicago ahead 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko hit a two-run double in the fifth for a 4-3 lead and he
scored on Knoblauch's bad throw with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch threw away a double-play relay in the sixth that would
have ended the inning, and Chicago scored again for a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fordyce had an RBI single in the seventh and a two-run double in
the eighth. Ordonez homered in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Yankees put Roger Clemens on the 15-day disabled list
because of a strained right groin. Reliever Darrell Einertson was

has won 11 of its last 12 road games. ... Frank Thomas hit an RBI
single, walked three times and nearly grounded into a triple play.

<HEADLINE> Comatose lawyer subject of child porn investigation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAMPTON, Va. (AP) - A local lawyer who was left comatose by a
New Jersey highway crash is under investigation for child
pornography based on a police search of his vehicle after the
accident, court records indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth A. Eusner, who was semiretired from his Hampton law
practice, was changing a flat tire on the Garden State Parkway on
June 4 when he was struck by a car. He suffered severe leg
injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
   After being taken to Hackensack University Medical Center,
Eusner suffered a heart attack and lapsed into a coma. A hospital
spokesman said Thursday that he was in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   In a search warrant affidavit filed by New Jersey State Police
with the Hampton Circuit Court, investigators said they found
''numerous pornographic photographs, including 49 obvious
pornographic photographs of children under the age of 16'' in
Eusner's vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Also found in the vehicle was a substance suspected to be
heroin, a .45-caliber handgun and ammunition, a .22-caliber rifle,
a .12-gauge shotgun and two knives, the document said.
</P>
<P>
   A special agent from the Virginia State Police Bureau of
Criminal Investigation searched Eusner's home this week and seized
a computer with the serial number obliterated, as well as floppy
disks, videotapes, photographs and e-mail, according to the
document.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jasinowski, head of state police investigations for the
Chesapeake division, declined to comment on the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Indians in Strange Place -- Second  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Here's how bad the baseball season has gotten
in Cleveland: Indians fans will spend the weekend rooting for the
hated New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Not since they were the majors' biggest laughingstock, playing
in dreary, dingy Cleveland Stadium to sparse crowds and losing on a
regular, basis have the Indians been this far out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, they'd be running away from the AL Central at this
point. Instead, the five-time defending division champs are 5{
games behind the blistering Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In second place. Hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we know how other teams feel,'' said catcher Sandy Alomar,
one of the few Cleveland players who remembers the bad old' days.
''I've been here since 1990 and have never really been in a pennant
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Cleveland, you're in one now.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, baseball's biggest surprise this season, completed a
three-game sweep in the rain Wednesday night. It was the club's
first sweep in Cleveland since the final series ever played at
Cleveland Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, who opened a four-game series in New York on
Thursday, outplayed the Indians in all three games.
</P>
<P>
   When they needed a big hit, the Sox got one. Their starting
pitching was better. And they played with a spirit the Indians
haven't shown this season and rarely in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I think they know they can play with us,'' Indians
first-year manager Charlie Manuel said. ''What we've got to do is
get better pitching and situation hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have left Manuel's pitching staff in shambles. He had
to start rookies Paul Rigdon and Jim Brower in the bookend games of
the series, and during Wednesday's 11-4 loss to the Sox, Manuel
used seven pitchers -- six of whom started the year in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   These days the most amazing thing about the Indians is when 24
hours pass without them making another roster move. Since May 18
they've placed seven players on the DL and have had three pitchers
undergo surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough to put a stretch of wins together with all the
transactions,'' Alomar said. ''But some of the young guys seem to
do a little better on the road, so we'll see this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who have lost four straight, open a three-game
series in Detroit on Friday before playing four games next week in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   How far back in the standings the Indians could be by then will
depend on how the Sox handle the pressure in Yankee Stadium and
whether the Indians can get a clutch hit.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has stranded 43 runners in its last four games, and in
the first two games against Chicago Indians hitters were 2 for 18
with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox went 7 for 11 with runners at second and third in the
first two innings Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Some help could be on the way. Manny Ramirez, on the DL since
May 30 with a strained left hamstring, will begin a rehab
assignment at Double-A Akron Friday and should join the Indians in
Chicago on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We miss Manny in the middle of our lineup,'' Manuel said.
''He's our big RBI guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Ramirez returns, what will the Indians do with Russell
Branyan? Since being promoted from Triple-A Buffalo, Branyan has
six homers in 22 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be tough to cut him,'' Manuel said. ''When he
hits, he puts fear into people. It will be a big decision.''
</P>
<P>
   And one made tougher by a pennant race.

<HEADLINE> Golf's Robert Trent Jones Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Robert Trent Jones, whose
challenging golf course designs annually play a role in crowning
champions at the sport's major events, has died. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who would have been 94 on June 20, died Wednesday night
at his apartment in Fort Lauderdale. He suffered a stroke last July
and his health had been failing since, his son, Rees, said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones died on the eve of the U.S. Open, a championship he was
linked with through his redesign of a number of prominent courses
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''He probably planned this,'' Rees Jones said from Pebble Beach,
Calif., where the Open began Thursday. ''The Open really was his
angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Rees Jones and his brother, Robert Trent ''Bobby'' Jones II,
have carried on their father's work, designing hundreds of courses
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Rees Jones said he had planned to be with his father on his
birthday. The family will hold services in Fort Lauderdale on that
day, he said, with his father to be buried later alongside his
mother in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''What he's done for golf course design is absolutely
phenomenal,'' Greg Norman said. ''He was very artistic in his work.
Some of it was landscaping. Some of it was shear beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Called the ''father of modern golf course architecture,'' Jones
was responsible for an estimated 310 courses in 45 states and 29
foreign countries or islands on every continent but Australia and
Antarctica. He also helped redesign about 150 other courses.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was sort of the innovator,'' Jack Nicklaus said. ''He did a
lot of things that others would not do. He moved a lot more dirt.
He created different types of bunkering.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' courses have served as host to 79 national championships,
including 20 U.S. Opens, 12 PGA Championships and six foreign
courses that have played host to the World Cup of Golf.
</P>
<P>
   The Englishman rankled golfers with his risk-reward philosophy,
deftly placing hazards that encouraged greater strategy. Jones
loved water's potential for extracting penalty strokes and was
among the first to employ major earth-moving equipment to realize
his vision.
</P>
<P>
   ''He liked large greens, undulating greens,'' Hale Irwin said.
''Not everyone was in agreement with what he did. He was always
doing something different from the other architects.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was the one who, with the late Bobby Jones, gave Augusta
National, site of the Masters, one of its most picturesque holes by
damming up Rae's Creek at critical junctures to create the par-3
16th with a pond in front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bobby Jones in our house was a god,'' Rees Jones recalled.
''Bobby Jones hired my dad just after World War II and he revered
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Annoyed that tour pros were routinely breaking 70, Jones liked
to say his holes were designed so that ''par was tough but a bogey
was easy.'' He provided relief to average golfers with multiple
forward tees and by keeping hazards out of their range.
</P>
<P>
   Among Jones' best-known creations are Spyglass Hill in Pebble
Beach, Calif.; Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio; Hazeltine
National in Chaska, Minn.; and Valderrama in Sotogrande, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   He also left his mark on a handful of muscular courses that
regularly play host to such majors as the U.S. Open, PGA
Championship and Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s, Jones was asked to rework such revered venues
as Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, N.J., Oakland Hills Country
Club in Birmingham, Mich.; Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester,
N.Y.; and The Olympic Club in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   That earned him the nickname ''The Open Doctor,'' but also a
host of complaints from pros accustomed to a bounty of birdies. The
notoriety, however, wasn't necessarily a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Players howled at Jones' overhaul of Oakland Hills for the 1951
U.S. Open. Only two players broke par of 70 that week. Ben Hogan
won with a 67 in the final round and later said, ''I'm glad I broke
this course, this monster, to its knees.''
</P>
<P>
   A fine golfer in his own right, ''Trent'' wasn't above taking
club in hand to make a point. On a visit to Baltusrol in 1952, he
answered a member's complaint about the redesigned par-3 fourth
hole by marching the critic and a few bystanders to the tee. He
took a swing, and the ball took one hop before diving into the
hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gentlemen,'' Jones said, ''I think that the hole is eminently
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was born June 20, 1906, in Ince, England, and emigrated
with his parents to Rochester, N.Y., five years later. He was a
scratch golfer by his early teens, but an ulcer sidelined him from
tournament competition.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinated by watching Donald Ross create Oak Hill, he became
the first person to study expressly for a career as a golf-course
designer. He used connections to get special entry into Cornell
University, where he fashioned his own program of study by taking
courses in landscape architecture, agronomy, horticulture,
hydraulics, surveying and economics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, he formed a partnership with Canadian designer Stanley
Thompson that became highly regarded. They parted ways in 1938, and
it wasn't until after World War II that Jones flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' first master work came in 1948, collaborating with Bobby
Jones to create Peachtree Golf Club in Atlanta. That also was when
he adopted the name Trent, from the river in England, to avoid
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   He often tried to juggle more than a dozen projects at a time,
but had a knack for understanding the changes in golf equipment and
disposition of the American golfer that preferred golf as a
''target'' sport than the bump-and-run game played overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Jones helped found the American Society of Golf Course
Architects in 1947 and won its first Donald Ross Award for
outstanding contributions to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held Tuesday at the All Saints
Episcopal Church in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Rees, of Montclair, N.J., and Bobby of Woodside,
Calif., Jones is survived by four grandchildren. Jones's wife, Ione
Tefft Davis, died in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Have Bottomed Out  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- This was supposed to be the year the
rebuilding ended for the Philadelphia Phillies. After 63 games,
however, the team has hit rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies, at 24-39, have the second-worst record in the
majors and are 16 games behind first-place Atlanta, which opens a
four-game series at Veterans Stadium on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one could've ever imagined this,'' said Curt Schilling, the
struggling ace who admits he's ''part of the problem, not the
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   After six straight losing seasons and 12 of 13, the Phillies
entered spring training with playoff aspirations following the
offseason acquisitions of Andy Ashby, a legitimate No. 2 starter,
and Mike Jackson, the top free-agent closer on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Philadelphia was 15{ games behind the Braves and out of
the pennant race by Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had high expectations going into the season. I definitely
wouldn't have thought we'd be in the position we're in now,''
catcher Mike Lieberthal said.
</P>
<P>
   The offense, considered to be the team's bright spot, has been a
major disappointment. The team is last in the NL in hitting (.245),
runs scored (258) and homers (63). The Phillies have scored two or
fewer runs in exactly one-third of their games, 21, winning one.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Phillies ranked fourth in the league in average
(.275) and sixth in runs (841).
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't explain it really. Guys are going out there every day,
trying to work it out,'' Lieberthal said. ''I don't know what it
is. I don't know if it's contagious or not. We're not scoring runs.
We're not getting hits with runners in scoring position. We're not
putting rallies together to where we put pressure on the pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Management, often criticized for having a small-market mentality
in a big-market city, opened their wallets and increased the
payroll from just under $30 million to over $45 million in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   But the moves failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did not throw a pitch for the Phillies, had shoulder
surgery and is out for the year. Ashby, a two-time All-Star, is 2-7
with a 6.16 ERA and has already indicated he doesn't want to
re-sign here after his contract runs out at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, Ashby and Paul Byrd, All-Stars last season, are a
combined 4-16. Byrd was exiled to Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre on
June 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not pleased with where we are. Nobody is. A lot of things
have certainly not gone the way we planned. Our record is one of
them,'' manager Terry Francona said. ''But you don't throw in the
towel, you don't whine, you don't pout. If anything, you try and
work harder. It's the only option.''
</P>
<P>
   Francona took over in 1997 and led the team to a last-place
finish and two straight third-place finishes. After topping out at
13 games over .500 last Aug. 6, the Phillies lost 37 of their last
53 games and are 40-76 overall since.
</P>
<P>
   Still, general manager Ed Wade insists Francona's job is safe,
and the players continue to support their manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''Terry Francona is the last guy in the world responsible for
what's happening to us now,'' Schilling said. ''We're just not
performing. We're not hitting. We're not pitching. We're not
playing solid, fundamental baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're playing as hard as we can play, but that's irrelevant in
the big leagues. It's all about results.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Person, who has emerged as the team's ace, agrees with
Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see any way anybody can blame the manager,'' said
Person, who is 5-2 with a 3.25 ERA. ''He's not out there hitting.
He's not doing the pitching. It's not his fault. He puts the best
lineup he can out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies have shown some spurts. Earlier in the season, they
won two of three from the New York Mets and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   They swept the then-AL East leading Boston Red Sox at the start
of this month, but have since lost two of three to Tampa Bay,
Baltimore and Florida, who had a combined record of 27 games under
.500 entering Thursday.	   Despite what seems like a hopeless situation,
Francona won't say
the season is lost.
</P>
<P>
   ''Save the season? It's the middle of June,'' he said. ''We have
to show up Friday and try to win. That's what you're supposed to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby thinks the team can turn it around just as easily.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing is to stay positive,'' he said. ''We have tons
of talent. We're scuffling, but you never know when it will change.
It can change Friday.''

Wildfires Raging in Colorado

<P>
   DRAKE, Colo. (AP) -- Blowtorch winds gusting to 60 mph whipped up two
wildfires and sent flames racing today, forcing firefighters to retreat and
driving hundreds more people from their homes in the foothills outside Denver.
More than 200 National Guardsmen were called in to join the 1,500 firefighters
already battling the two blazes. The fires have burned nearly 15,000 acres and
destroyed about 50 structures, mostly homes, since Monday. Before the flareup

Feds Make Big Heroin Bust

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents made more than 170 arrests today as they
broke up a multimillion-dollar Mexican heroin ring alleged to have smuggled
unusually pure and cheap black tar heroin into new markets from one U.S. coast
to the other. The gang, based in the Nayarit state of Mexico, was distributing
80 pounds of heroin each month, worth more than $7 million, in 22 U.S. cities,
said Joe Keefe, chief of special operations for the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The ring was marketing the heroin at such a high level of purity
and such a low price that the Mexicans pushed into eastern U.S. markets formerly
served by Colombian drug traffickers, Keefe said in an interview.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Southern California will decide tomorrow whether nearly

alternative fuels -- a move that could lead to similar requirements across the
country. ''We will see a sea of clean-fuel vehicles in California and around the
country'' if the rules are passed, said Gail Ruderman Feuer of the Natural
Resources Defense Council. Under the plan, believed to be the first of its kind
in the nation, every new vehicle purchased by public fleet operators will have

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Strike Marked by Violence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Police fired tear gas to disperse about
100 protesters Thursday during a national strike that failed to
gather widespread support.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, business went on as usual in Ecuador's main
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist-led Patriotic Front -- an umbrella organization
representing unions, student groups and grassroots organizations --
had hoped to paralyze this small Andean nation to protest the
switch to the U.S. dollar as the official currency.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross spokesman Cristian Rivera told The Associated Press
that three people, including a police officer, were wounded by
shotgun pellets during sporadic clashes between demonstrators and
authorities in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not immediately release information on the number of
arrests made.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strike does not merit our support,'' said Jose Ormaza, a
leader of informal merchants in Quito. ''We have to work every day
to earn our keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of protesters tried block provincial highways and
city avenues throughout the nation, but were dispersed by police
and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In Quito, students hijacked a bus, beat up the driver and set
the vehicle ablaze. And in coastal Guayaquil, protesters detonated
a small bomb that shattered the windows of a Citibank branch, with
no injuries reported.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 teachers held a peaceful rally in Quito. Ecuador's
23,000 public schools have been shut since mid-May when some
140,000 teachers refused to report to work, demanding salary
increases.
</P>
<P>
   The government is in the process of replacing the national
currency, the sucre, with the U.S. greenback. President Gustavo
Noboa hopes the move will stabilize the economy, promote business
investment and end Latin America's highest inflation, now running
at nearly 100 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue the dollar plan will hurt the poor by causing
prices to rise to international levels. Currently many basic food
products and services are subsidized.

<HEADLINE> Former Chile Police Chief Dies  </HEADLINE>
By EVA VERGARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Retired Gen. Humberto Gordon Rubio, a
former junta member and ex-chief of dictator Augusto Pinochet's
secret police, died Thursday night while under house arrest, his
spokesman said. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon -- a trusted confidante of Pinochet during the dictator's
1973-90 rule -- was facing prosecution for human rights abuses at
the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's spokesman, lawyer Fernando Uribe Echeverria, said the
retired general died of a heart attack at his home in an exclusive
Santiago suburb. He added that Gordon's health had been
deteriorating as he defended himself against the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole traumatic situation ... evidently had to have taken
its toll,'' said Uribe Echeverria, speaking of Gordon's indictment
and ongoing prosecution in connection with the 1982 death of a
prominent labor leader. He said Gordon had recently spent some time
in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, like some 40 former military officers, was being brought
to task by a newly emboldened judiciary that followed the
restoration of democracy and the end of 17 years of military rule
in 1990. He steadfastly maintained his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   After spending years as chief of Pinochet's feared secret
police, Gordon became a member of the dictator's ruling junta.
According to an official report, 3,190 people were killed under
Pinochet's regime, and more than 1,000 remain unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was facing prosecution by a judge in connection with the
1982 death of labor leader Tucapel Jimenez. The activist's body was
recovered in February 1982 in his car. His throat was cut and face
disfigured by five bullet wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Some 21 people, including other top military officers, are being
prosecuted in connection with that case.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's death was certain to deal another blow to Pinochet, the
ailing 84-year-old former strongman who last month was stripped of
his immunity from prosecution by a Santiago court amid moves to
prosecute the former dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyers have appealed to Chile's supreme court. The
lower court ruling, if allowed to stand, would allow Pinochet to
face trial on human rights charges including the disappearance of
opponents of his regime soon after the bloody 1973 coup that
toppled elected Marxist president Salvador Allende.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, as a senator for life, had previously enjoyed immunity
from prosecution and he also has proclaimed he did nothing wrong
during his rule. Some 113 criminal complaints have been filed
against him for alleged abuses stemming from his regime.

<HEADLINE> Savard, Mullen, Bush in Hockey Hall  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   Denis Savard and Joe Mullen have strong ties to Original Six
cities. The paths for the newest selections to the Hockey Hall of
Fame, though, were somewhat different.
</P>
<P>
   Savard, a Quebec native who starred in the Montreal junior
leagues, and Mullen, a New York City native whose father worked on
the Madison Square Garden ice for over 30 years, were chosen
Thursday to enter the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Walter L. Bush Jr., president of USA Hockey and a vice-president
of the International Ice Hockey Federation, will also be inducted
to the Toronto museum on Nov. 13, in the builders' category.
</P>
<P>
   Savard, 39, scored 473 goals and added 865 assists in a 17-year
career spent mostly with Chicago. He played three seasons with
Montreal, winning his only Stanley Cup there in 1993, and just over
one season with Tampa Bay before returning to the Blackhawks for
his final two-plus seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a surprise,'' Savard said of being chosen in his first
year of eligibility. ''It's probably one of the toughest halls to
get into in sports. As far as my profession is concerned, it's the
greatest thing to happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullen learned the game late, growing up in the Hell's Kitchen
area of New York City. He didn't don skates for the first time
until he was 10 years old and credits roller hockey for his
development.
</P>
<P>
   ''We definitely had more concrete than ice,'' said Mullen, who
had 502 goals and 561 assists in 17 seasons with St. Louis,
Calgary, Pittsburgh and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, having his father working at Madison Square Garden and
bringing home sticks from Rangers players and their opponents
didn't hurt his pursuit of a hockey career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never had to sneak in,'' Mullen said. ''I never got to skate
in the old Madison Square Garden but I could look out my window and
see it. I was always busy playing roller hockey myself anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullen, who also enters in the first year he is eligible after a
mandatory three-year waiting period, was the first American-born
player to reach 500 goals and 1,000 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never looked at those accomplishments as being an American
thing,'' Mullen said. ''I looked at them as a milestone that's
great to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''But being the first at anything always adds some flavor to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullen, 43, was a member of the 1989 Calgary Flames who won the
Stanley Cup. He also played with Pittsburgh when they won
consecutive titles in 1991 and '92.
</P>
<P>
   He had career highs with 51 goals and 110 points in 1989 and led
playoff scorers with 16 goals. Mullen also had five other seasons
in which he scored at least 40 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Savard had to leave the Blackhawks to get his only championship.
He was dealt to the Canadiens on June 29, 1990 for Chris Chelios.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montreal is a great hockey town and a great organization,''
said Savard, who finished in the top 10 in scoring five times --
including a career-high 131 points in 1987-88. ''I knew that when I
went there I had a great chance to win one.''
</P>
<P>
   Savard hoped to play for Montreal coming into the NHL, but those
plans were dashed when the Canadiens passed over him in the draft.
Montreal chose Doug Wickenheiser with the top pick, leaving Savard
to the Blackhawks at No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chicago was a special place for me,'' Savard said. ''I played
13 of my 17 years here. I'm still in Chicago and hopefully I'll be
here forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10 native of Pointe Gatineau, Quebec, was known as a
great playmaker, but did have three straight years of at least 40
goals from 1985-86 through 1987-88. His 1,338 points rank 17th on
the NHL's career list. Savard retired in 1997 to become an
assistant coach with Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both Denis and I came into the league and got out at the same
time,'' Mullen said. ''To watch Denis on the ice and see him do his
thing was definitely worth the price of admission.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullen, despite his 5-9 frame, was able to fight to get in front
of the net to score.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing I remember the most is he was a great two-way
player,'' Savard said of Mullen, who was not drafted after a
four-year career at Boston College. ''He paid the price and was the
kind of player that never shied away from anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18-member selection committee consists of former players
Bobby Orr, Serge Savard, Stan Mikita and Marty Pavelich, NHL
vice-president Jim Gregory, general managers Pat Quinn of Toronto
and Harry Sinden of Boston, Tampa Bay Lightning consultant Cliff
Fletcher, and Emile Francis, the former NHL player, coach and
manager. Serge Savard and Denis Savard are not related.
</P>
<P>
   The media is represented on the committee by Red Fisher of the
Montreal Gazette, Jim Proudfoot of the Toronto Star and Bert
Raymond of The Montreal Journal, and broadcasters Dick Irvin, Frank
Selke and John Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Chynoweth of Edmonton, a director of the WHL junior league,
Washington Capitals president Richard Patrick and former referee
Frank Udvari make up the rest of the selectors.
</P>
<P>
   There are 319 members of the Hall, including 218 players, 14
referees and linesmen, and 87 builders.
</P>
<P>
   Rules stipulate that only those selected can be talked about by
the committee. Dale Hawerchuk and Glenn Anderson were thought to be
potential selections but were not chosen.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urged To Return Kuwait's Stuff  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged Iraq to
return government archives, museum pieces and military equipment
seized from Kuwait after its 1990 invasion.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the Security Council Thursday, Annan agreed with
his special coordinator, retired Russian ambassador Yuli Vorontsov,
that while Iraq has returned ''a substantial quantity of
property,'' it has an obligation to return many more items to
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait maintains that during Iraq's seven-month occupation, it
took valuable pieces from the Islamic and National Museums,
archives from the foreign ministry, prime minister's office and
other government departments, and a significant quantity of
military hardware. Iraqi forces were routed from Kuwait by a
U.S.-led allied coalition during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   A Security Council resolution adopted Dec. 17 outlined a new
Iraq policy, primarily aimed at returning weapons inspectors to
Iraq. But it also reiterated Iraq's obligation under the 1991
resolution that ended the Gulf War to return all looted Kuwaiti
property and account for over 600 missing Kuwaitis and called for
the appointment of a high-level coordinator to try to settle these
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is considered Iraq's strongest ally on the U.N. Security
Council, and Vorontsov's appointment in February to deal with both
the looted property and missing Kuwaitis issues was seen as a
serious new effort to bring them to closure after nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Annan reiterated in his first report to the council on efforts
to return Kuwaiti property that while Vorontsov's mandate comes
from the Dec. 17 resolution, ''understanding and goodwill are of
critical importance for the success of his mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is accompanied by a list of military equipment which
Kuwait says has not been returned including eight Mirage fighter
planes, 335 armored personnel carriers, 669 SAM surface-to-air
missiles, and over 3,700 TOW anti-tank missiles.

<HEADLINE> Boston Garden Center Court Sold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The parquet center court featuring the leprechaun
logo that carried the Boston Celtics through 16 NBA championships
sold for $331,100 in an online auction Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 parquet panels were expected to sell for between $75,000
to $100,000, during two weeks of bidding at Sotheby's online
auction site, sothebys.amazon.com. The price surged past
expectations in the final two hours of bidding, according to Matt
Robbins, a spokesman for Sotheby's in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's did not identify the winning bidder.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Sager, who called himself a Boston-based financier, said
he entered the wining bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very special part of history for me,'' Sager said.
</P>
<P>
   Sager, who said he also owns some seats from the old Boston
Garden, said he planned to lend the floor for charity events.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost like I felt like I had to (buy it),'' Sager said.
''I felt compelled to be the guardian, the keeper of the flame, if
you will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics originally built the entire floor for $11,000 during
a World War II wood shortage. They were forced to use short scraps
of red oak, producing the floor's trademark parquet look.
</P>
<P>
   When the team moved out of the old Boston Garden in 1996, they
took the floor with them to the FleetCenter. It was replaced in
December at a cost of $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's also put 20 other panels up for sale. FleetCenter
director of marketing Jeff Mann spent eight months poring over
videos and photographs matching the panels to famous basketball
moments.
</P>
<P>
   Among the smaller panels sold Thursday was one dubbed ''Havlicek
Stole the Ball,'' identified as where John Havlicek stole the ball
on the final play of the 1965 Eastern Conference finals, ensuring
the Celtics' 110-109 victory over Philadelphia. It sold for
$28,600.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the lots were expected to draw about $500,000,
Robbins said.

<HEADLINE> Campfire Wilderness Rules Eased  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DULUTH, Minn. (AP) -- A ban on campfires in some of the nation's
most popular wilderness area is being eased after recent cold, wet
weather, federal officials announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Campfires had been banned for several weeks in more than a third
of the 1.1 million acre Boundary Waters Canoe Area, where a severe
windstorm last July 4 knocked down millions of trees.
</P>
<P>
   But after a recent cold weather spell, officials decided to
allow campfires in the area between 7 p.m. and midnight, Superior
National Forest spokeswoman Kris Reichenbach said. The midnight
cutoff will allow campfires to cool before morning, she said.
</P>

200,000 adventurers from around the world every year.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 12, Twins 5  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Mike Cameron set a career high with four
hits, tied his major league-best with five RBIs and hit his first
career grand slam Thursday night as the Seattle Mariners beat the
Minnesota Twins 12-5.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Ramsey (1-1), who relieved injured starter Paul Abbott,
pitched 2 2-3 innings for his first major league victory, and
Rickey Henderson had three singles, scored three runs and reached
base four times for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez and John Olerud each hit two-run homers off
LaTroy Hawkins in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Twins starter Mark Redman (4-2), who surrendered six earned runs
on eight hits, five walks and no strikeouts, needed 82 pitches to
record seven outs.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up three straight singles to start the game before Edgar
Martinez bounced into a fielder's choice, driving in one run.
Cameron followed an RBI single by Henderson in the second with a
shot over the power alley in left for a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Henderson singled, stole second and scored on
Cameron's single off Hector Carrasco. Alex Rodriguez made it 8-1
with another single.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron's night wasn't all good. He misplayed Corey Koskie's
drive in the seventh and the ball bounced off his glove for a
two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins scored two more in the eighth, on Butch Huskey's
run-scoring groundout and Jay Canizaro's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott handcuffed the Twins, allowing only Matt Lawton's
sacrifice fly in the first, before leaving after four innings with
cramps in his right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's homer was his 18th and Olerud's was his fourth. Both
traveled 415 feet.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Twins, who have lost five of six, are 1-5 against
Seattle this year. They haven't won a season series from the
Mariners since 1992. ... The Mariners placed C Dan Wilson on the
15-day DL with a pulled muscle in his left side and recalled
veteran Joe Oliver from Triple A Tacoma. Wilson pulled a muscle
near his left rib cage in the second inning of the Mariners' loss
at Kansas City on Wednesday night. ... Seattle's David Bell flied
out to center field twice in second inning.

<HEADLINE> Solomon Islands Police Can Return  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- Rebels who have seized the
capital said Thursday that they would allow police to return to
their jobs, but didn't say whether they would give them back their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The well-armed rebels, who forced the leader of this South
Pacific nation to resign on Wednesday, said police would be
responsible for security in the capital city. But without the
weapons, which rebels looted from police headquarters last week,
the militants would continue to be the real enforcers.
</P>
<P>
   Police, who asked not to be identified, said late Thursday that
they still did not have their weapons and could not effectively
patrol the streets without them.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel statement said the police would work together with the
militants ''to ensure that there is a smooth transition to normal
policing in Honiara.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was signed by rebel leader Andrew Nori and Deputy
Commissioner of Police Wilfred Akao, who joined the rebels' drive
to oust Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that the dispute was easing, some fighters from
the warring factions put down their weapons and shared food and
hugs Friday at a frontline checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   However, after about an hour, the fighters took up their guns
again and vowed not to disarm until a peace deal has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   In another development Friday, a group of about 70 women --
frustrated that men haven't brought peace -- approached the warring
groups with a simple message: Stop fighting and talk peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think as mothers, they are our sons. We brought them here
in our wombs and we love them and we want them to lay down their
guns,'' said Margaret Aihunu, a teacher who joined the women at a
rally in Honiara before leaving to meet the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict revolves around land. The indigenous residents of
the main island of Guadalcanal, known as Isatabus, have been
forcing out migrants from the nearby island of Malaita. About
20,000 Malaitans have been expelled over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Angry they have not been compensated for lost land and homes,
Malaitans raided an armory, took over the capital and demanded a
change in government. The Isatabus retreated to the countryside,
where they own most of the land. Both sides have been honoring an
unwritten cease-fire that expires next week.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the prime minister resigned and announced a
12-member committee made up of government and opposition leaders
would try to arrange peace talks with the warring parties.
Ulufa'alu said he hoped a deal could be reached within two weeks,
allowing parliament to elect a new leader without the intimidation
of rebels.
</P>
<P>
   An Australian ship off the nation's coast may be used as a
neutral venue for the peace talks or for parliament, the Australian
Defense Department said.

<HEADLINE> Pirro as pure as Ivory soap, attorney says  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Albert Pirro, husband of the
Westchester County district attorney, is 99.9 percent pure, ''like
the old Ivory Soap commercial,'' his lawyer said Thursday in
closing arguments at Pirro's tax evasion trial.
</P>
<P>
   But a prosecutor compared Pirro to Richard Nixon, prompting the
defense attorney to demand a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   In the second and final day of his summation, defense attorney
Gustave Newman tried to convince the federal jury that Pirro was
simply running his business affairs informally, treating all his
various companies as part of his household, when he used corporate
checks to buy personal items ranging from a guitar string to a
Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the funds were going ''from Al Pirro's left pocket
to Al Pirro's right pocket,'' Newman said, with District Attorney
Jeanine Pirro in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro and his accountant, his brother Anthony, are
accused of conspiring to evade taxes on $1.2 million of Albert
Pirro's income by disguising personal spending as deductible
business expenses. After a four-week trial, the jury is scheduled
to begin deliberating on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But first, Judge Barrington Parker will rule on Newman's demand
for a mistrial, which was prompted by prosecutor Cathy Seibel's
rebuttal. She noted that Nixon was driven from the presidency by
his own tape recordings and that many of the documents used against
the Pirros were their own canceled checks and records.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Nixon's case it was power that drove him and in this case
it was money that drove Albert Pirro, but sometimes people keep
very damaging information around,'' Seibel said.
</P>
<P>
   Newman objected strenuously, saying the remark was ''venomous
and could poison the jury.'' The judge allowed Seibel to continue
and reserved decision on the mistrial motion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Newman told the jurors that Pirro, a real estate
developer and one of the state's top lobbyists, was ''indifferent''
to his bookkeeping. ''He was preoccupied with building business,
his irons in the fire,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a tiny line on a pie chart for the jury, Newman claimed
that only one-tenth of 1 percent of Pirro's corporate deductions
were being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like the old Ivory Soap commercial, he's 99.9 percent pure,''
Newman said. The advertising slogan was actually ''99-44/100%
Pure.''
</P>
<P>
   Without saying so, Newman seemed to shift the blame for improper
deductions to Anthony Pirro, noting that when Albert Pirro signed
his tax returns, they had already been filled out and signed by his
brother and gave him no reason to be suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   But Roger Stavis, Anthony Pirro's lawyer, said a lack of
communication between the brothers - as well as some admittedly
sloppy work by Anthony - was the cause of the problem.

<P>
   The Pirro brothers ''did not have a particularly close
relationship,'' he said, and even counting social occasions, they
saw each other only a few times a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''What kind of a conspiracy is this?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Both defense attorneys took offense at Seibel's characterization
of the Pirro brothers as ''crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Assistant U.S. attorneys are not supposed to call names like
that,'' Stavis said.
</P>
<P>
   Seibel laughed off some of the defense contentions, and said
Albert Pirro was resorting to ''the old blame-it-on-the-accountant
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the government's case was circumstantial,
Seibel said the evidence was nevertheless clear that ''what they
did only makes sense as a tax fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Pirro said the final arguments brought
him ''one step closer to the end of a terrible ordeal.''

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Phone Service Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- All the phones at the State Department were
knocked out Thursday night, including lines into key offices like
the 24-hour operations center.
</P>
<P>
   The phones went down at about 8:40 p.m. EDT and were still out
almost three hours later. While repair crews were at the building
with generators, it was unclear when service would be restored, a
department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretary of state for
administration, was on the scene overseeing the repairs, the
official said. The staff working in the building were using cell
phones to conduct business.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight Thursday, the department's 24-hour
emergency hot line for Americans traveling overseas was working
sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   Severe thunderstorms were moving through the region Thursday
night, causing power outages for thousands of people, but it was
unknown whether they were responsible for the State Department
phone failure.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a fire, apparently caused by an electrical short,
knocked out phone service in parts of the State Department and
forced workers on two floors to evacuate the building after they
locked up classified material. Much of the disrupted phone service
was restored by Thursday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Hill, Paisley Win at TNN Awards  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An absent George Strait swept five
categories at the TNN Awards for country music Thursday, with
newcomer Brad Paisley nipping at his heels with his popular song
celebrating stepparents.
</P>
<P>
   Strait won the top award of best entertainer, best male
vocalist, best album for ''Always Never The Same'' and single for
''Write This Down.''
</P>
<P>
   He also got the Impact Award, given for getting country music
exposure in advertisements, television and movies. Strait is a
commercial spokesman for Wrangler jeans and other products.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks to all the fans,'' said MCA Records executive Tony
Brown, who produces Strait's records. ''George is the greatest.
He's the king of the cowboys!''
</P>
<P>
   Paisley won the newly created Discovery Award, given to a new
artist with the most star potential. His ''He Didn't Have to Be''
won for best song and video.
</P>
<P>
   The song was written by Paisley and Kelley Lovelace about
Lovelace's relationship with his stepson. Paisley brought Lovelace
and the 9-year-old boy, McCain Merren, onstage to share the glory
when he won best song.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greatest thing about country music is you can write a song
that you think is so personal that there's no way it could be
anybody else's story,'' Paisley said. ''And you find out that we
are all the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith Hill won best female vocalist, and the Dixie Chicks were
named best group or duo.
</P>
<P>
   The quartet Alabama tearfully accepted an award for charity work
named after the late comedian Minnie Pearl. Kenny Rogers, who
recently scored comeback hits with ''The Greatest'' and ''Buy Me a
Rose,'' won a career achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the last 10-12 years ... I've been giving out these
awards, and doing it with as much grace as I possibly could,''
Rogers said. ''But it's a wonderful thing to receive an award, and
particularly at this point in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old singer Billy Gilman introduced a medley of
performances by veteran artists Loretta Lynn, Ronnie Milsap and The
Charlie Daniels Band.
</P>
<P>
   The TNN Awards cap International Country Music Fan Fair, an
annual week of performances and autograph sessions that draw more
than 20,000 fans to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   This year marked a new sponsor for the TNN Awards. Country
Weekly magazine has replaced Music City News, which recently
folded.
</P>
<P>
   The nominations came from fans and music industry workers. Fans
voted for the winners through telephone numbers announced on TNN,
ballots in Country Weekly magazine and two Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The TNN Awards are the second of three major annual country
music awards shows, and the only one that gives fans a voice in
choosing winners. The others are the Country Music Association
awards in the fall and the Academy of Country Music awards in the
spring.

<HEADLINE> 5 Teachers Inducted In Hall of Fame  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leslie Revis began her education in a home
that didn't have television or radio but did have grandparents and
great-grandparents with a proud Hispanic heritage and hours upon
hours of stories.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come from a long line of educators, some with certificates,
some without,'' said Revis, who was inducted along with four other
teachers Thursday into the National Teachers Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   As lead teacher in the foreign language department at Beaufort
High School in St. Helena Islands, S.C., Revis stepped in when
another teacher left her job with six months to go in the school
year. She added five classes to the six she was already teaching,
Revis said, and she was six months pregnant at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Berry, a principal and teacher at Columbia Elementary
School in Logansport, Ind., explained how she never wants kids to
feel embarrassed. So rather than nagging when chairs are pulled out
from tables, or closet doors left ajar, she developed an imaginary
allergy to disorder, sneezing or coughing to help students
remember.
</P>
<P>
   In her classroom, Charlotte the imaginary elephant steps on the
toes of rude children, and Mikey the imaginary bald eagle pecks the
nose of anyone who doesn't watch a classroom speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children love it,'' Berry said. ''It's an atmosphere of
loving. My children learn loving -- I mean, love learning. None of
you would be here if not for your teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Also inducted were Susie Haas, who teaches kindergarten at John
Adams Elementary School in Riverside, Calif.; Debi Barrett-Hayes,
an art teacher at Florida State University School in Tallahassee,
Fla.; and Sandra Worsham, a retired English teacher from
Milledgeville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Located in Emporia, Kan., the Hall of Fame inducted its first
five teachers in 1992. Last year's honorees included Jaime
Escalante, the retired math teacher who gained national attention
after helping a group of low-income East Los Angeles students pass
the tough Advanced Placement calculus exam. His story was the basis
of the 1987 film ''Stand and Deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of fame officials work closely with Emporia State
University's Teachers College.

<HEADLINE> Legislation passed to raise PINS age to 18  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Assembly approved a measure that
would allow parents to retain legal control of disobedient
teen-agers until they reach 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the bill approved late Thursday would revise the
current ''Person in Need of Supervision'' by raising the cutoff age
from 16 to 18. The chamber overwhelmingly passed the bill, 142-1.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation now goes to Gov. George Pataki for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Under current state law, a person in need of supervision, or
PIN, is defined as a male under the age of 16 or a female under the
age of 18 who does not attend school, is in frequent trouble with
police or is beyond parental control. Runaways can be returned by
authorities to their homes if they fall under the PINS age.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the distinction between the ages of boys and girls in
the PINS law was declared unconstitutional, and since then the
state's Family Courts have used 16 to be the cutoff PINS age across
the board.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled state Senate has in previous years
passed the bill to raise the PINS age and did so again in May. But
the measure never made it out of committee in the Democrat-led
Assembly until this year.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Stephen Kaufman, a Bronx Democrat and sponsor of the
bill, said a ''confluence'' of factors, including strong support
among parents as well as other Assembly members, enabled the
passage of the bill in his chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill undoes an injustice,'' Kaufman said. ''This will
give parents the ability to reunify themselves with their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Helene Weinstein, who voted in favor of the bill,
cautioned that raising the PINS age would also mean the need for
more resources for Family Courts and other social service agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''By passing this bill without providing resources, we'll be
flooding an already overfilled family court. It's critical that we
need to dramatically increase (those resources),'' the Brooklyn
Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said at an Albany news conference earlier Thursday that
he hasn't seen the PINS legislation and added that ''we'll be glad
to take a look at it'' when the bill is sent to his office.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by Pataki, the law would take effect Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who lobbied for passage of the bill during the past week
in the state Capitol monitored Assembly proceedings late into
Thursday night. They applauded when the chamber finally approved
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Reed said there was ''absolutely nothing we could do''
three years ago when her then 17-year-old son ran away from their
suburban Syracuse home. She said raising the PINS age to 18 would
have allowed police to bring her son back and given her more time
to discipline the teen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd have another year to try to work with him, to work with
any program that he was in,'' Reed said.

<HEADLINE> Wind Sends Colo. Fire Toward Houses  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRAKE, Colo. (AP) -- Blowtorch winds gusting to 60 mph whipped
two wildfires and sent flames racing Thursday, forcing firefighters
to retreat and driving hundreds more people from their homes in the
foothills outside Denver.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 National Guardsmen were called in to join the
1,500 firefighters already battling the two blazes.
</P>
<P>
   But crews expected that calmer winds Friday would allow
firefighters to attack from the air again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the worst is over,'' said fire information officer Bob
Sturdivant. ''Humidity is up. The fire behavior won't be as erratic
as it has been. The winds will die down tomorrow. We will have
quite an air show.''
</P>
<P>
   The fires have burned nearly 17,200 acres and destroyed about 50
structures, mostly homes, since Monday. Before the flareup
Thursday, about 800 people had been evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   One blaze was burning just east of Rocky Mountain National Park,
about 50 miles northwest of Denver. The other was 35 miles
southwest of Denver, near the Pike National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   As flames raced up tree trunks and through tinder-dry ground
cover, enormous plumes of gray and white smoke billowed over
mountain ridges. Haze blanketed the communities, where residents
waited anxiously for news.
</P>
<P>
   Wind gusts swelled the northern blaze to 8,100 acres from 6,700
acres the night before, forcing hundreds of people to flee. People
who had been allowed back into their homes earlier in the week were
ordered to get out again.
</P>
<P>
   Fire trucks helped move people out of the fire's path.
</P>
<P>
   JoAnne Grace said she and her husband watered down the grass
around their house and stuffed two cars full of their belongings,
preparing to flee at midday. She said the fire was about a mile
from their home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's peeking over the crest of the hill. It's very smoky with
black bellows,'' Grace said in a telephone interview. ''It's
directly across the ridge from us. There are quite a few
bulldozers.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest of Denver, weary firefighters struggled to maintain
the lines they had built around the 9,100-acre blaze there and to
keep flames away from homes scattered through a dozen small
subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters retreated to open meadows for safety at one point
when roaring wind-driven flames drew close to a sawmill built in
1930.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both for personal safety and progress of the fire, the winds
are probably our most serious issue,'' said Jim Krugman, deputy
incident commander.
</P>
<P>
   The northern fire affected primarily ranching and farming
communities dotted with mostly small homes.
</P>
<P>
   The southwestern fire was burning near a dozen subdivisions in
an area that has become a magnet for retirees and residents seeking
weekend getaways. Some are large and graceful homes; others are
more moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The fire cut a swath 3-4 miles long, leaving skeletons of
charred trees and blackened ground in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Dokter, who was evacuated from her brand-new home in the
Bailey area, was allowed to return Thursday to collect clothes,
photos and important papers. Her home was completed just three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fire was burning five homes away from us,'' Dokter said.
''With the wind shift, we're concerned our house could still go.''
</P>
<P>
   State Farm insurance agent Eric Anderson, who inspected the
area, said street signs were burned down, so one client drew him a
map to a home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a river of aluminum where it melted and piles of glass
melted into glue. Window frames burned stripes on the ground,'' he
said. ''The only things left were the metal appliances and the
chimney.''
