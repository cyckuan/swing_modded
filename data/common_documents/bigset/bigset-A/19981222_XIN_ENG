<HEADLINE> Singapore Police: Bomb Threat Against Americans A Hoax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore police said Monday
evening that investigations have revealed that a bomb threat call
against the American community in the city state turned out to be
a hoax.
</P>
<P>
The police made the confirmation in a response to the U.S.
Embassy in Singapore and the Singapore American Club that
contacted the police Monday afternoon after the embassy received a
bomb threat call.
</P>
<P>
The American Club was closed after it was informed by the U.S.
Embassy of what it called "non-specific threats to the American
Community" at about noon.
</P>
<P>
The Television Corporation of Singapore quoted a spokesman from
the American Club as saying that it took about 15 minutes to
evacuate more than 1,000 people from the Club.
</P>
<P>
The club will resume business as usual Tuesday, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The police warned that delivering a false message, like a bomb
threat, is punishable with a fine of up to 50,000 Singapore
dollars (about 30,000 U.S dollars) and imprisonment of up to seven
years.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Not to Meet Soeharto: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian State
Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung Monday ruled out the possibility
of a meeting between President B.J. Habibie and his predecessor,
Soeharto, for a "national dialogue."
</P>
<P>
There could never be a meeting among Habibie, former president
Soeharto, Nahdlatul Ulama leader Abdurrahman Wahid and Armed
Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto, Tanjung told reporters at the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on Wahid's efforts to bring about a meeting
among the four for a "national dialogue" to solve the nation's
political problems.
</P>
<P>
Wahid had already met Gen. Wiranto and Soeharto in preparation
of the proposed dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung said a meeting between Habibie and former president
Soeharto was always possible but only in the nature of a "social
get-together."
</P>
<P>
He said Habibie neither had any plan to hold a dialogue with
the other leaders minus Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"I believe such a meeting won't happen because Habibie has
positioned himself as a president who will implement the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung said the MPR was the highest council of state so a
national dialogue is best held in the MPR where figures from the
various regions of Indonesia also have seats. "A dialogue in the
assembly would be the most constitutional of all possible
dialogues," he added.

UNITED NATIONS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council was meeting to consider its relations with Iraq,
focusing on economic sanctions, arms inspections and a relief
program intended to aid Iraqis suffering under an economic
embargo, U.N. officials said Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
This is Security Council's first meeting on Iraq after the
United States and Britain announced to end their military Strikes
on December 19.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. diplomats, the 15-member Council is
sharply divided in these issues.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said the difficulty the Council faces is that the
negotiated resolutions on Iraq have linked the sanctions,
inspections and the "oil-for-food" plan that will be hard to
separate.
</P>
<P>
The Council may take the first step to start a full review of
United Nations relations with Iraq, but this is unlikely to happen
until the next year, the diplomats added.

abolishing direct election of prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset met here Monday to vote on a bill calling for early

<HEADLINE> Former Presidents Ford, Carter Propose Bipartisan Censure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Presidents
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter on Monday proposed to end the
impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton with a
bipartisan censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
The linchpin would be language stating that Clinton accepted
the findings in the resolution. But his admission that he did not
tell the truth could not be used against him in a future trial.
</P>
<P>
"Somehow we must reach a conclusion that most Americans can
embrace and that posterity will approve," Ford and Carter wrote in
an op-ed column published in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
"Make no mistake, the judgment of history does matter. It
matters profoundly. And impeachment by the full House has already
brought profound disgrace to President Clinton. Whatever happens
now will do little to affect history's judgment of him."
</P>
<P>
Both Ford and Carter said their suggestion rises out of the
precedents they set while president. Ford, who assumed office
after President Richard Nixon resigned following the Watergate
scandal, later pardoned Nixon. Carter, who beat Ford in the 1976
presidential race, later granted amnesty to those who had avoided
the Vietnam draft.
</P>
<P>
"While our acts of pardon or clemency are not directly
analogous to the decision pending in the Senate, how that body
resolves the issue can have similar benefits of healing and
finality," Ford and Carter wrote.
</P>
<P>
A poll shows that public tends to agree with the opinion.
</P>
<P>
In interviews shortly after Clinton was impeached on Saturday,
31 percent said the Senate should go ahead with a trial on the
charges, while 63 percent said they would prefer that the Senate
work out a compromise to instead censure or fine the president.
</P>
<P>
The CBS-New York Times survey also showed Republicans with
their worst popularity ratings in the 14 years the two news
organizations had asked the question. Only 36 percent expressed a
favorable view of the Republican Party, while 58 percent expressed
an unfavorable one.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 661 adults carried a 4-percentage-point margin of
error.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Hails Jordanian Parliament's Pro-Iraq Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) Chairman Saadoun Hammadi Monday praised the Jordanian
parliament for approving a decision calling on its government to
break the U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi made the remarks in a letter to Speaker of Jordanian
House of Representatives Abdu Hadi Majali.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Hammadi also called on Arab parliaments to
pursue a pro-Arab stance to support the Iraqi people who are
facing the forces of evil and aggression, the Iraqi News agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions will not be lifted until the
U.N. Special Commission, which monitors Iraq's disarmament,
certifies that Iraq has cleared off all weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The commission has repeatedly run into standoffs with Iraq and
the latest one has led to four nights of U.S.-British air strikes
on Iraq last week.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Times reported Monday that the parliament
unanimously decided to break the embargo on Iraq, and called on
its government and other Arab governments to defy it and hold an
Arab summit to discuss the joint U.S.-British aggression against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian parliament voiced total solidarity with Iraq and
its people and strongly denounced "the barbaric attacks
perpetrated" by the U.S. and British governments.

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees Global Economic Growth Slower but Mood Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) issued a supplementary World Economic Outlook here
Monday provided a little slower growth revision but asserted
general mood has improved from three months ago.
</P>
<P>
The IMF 169-page joint interim World Economic Outlook and
International Capital Markets said that while the danger of a
world-wide recession does seem to have diminished, it would be
premature to consider the global economy's difficulties to be
over.
</P>
<P>
The IMF report lowered its 1999 world growth forecast down to
2.2 percent or 2.3 percent as compared with a 2.5 percent growth
predicted in the previous report released in September.
</P>
<P>
However, thanks to a number of steps taken recently, which
include interest rate cuts around the world and a large IMF-led
international rescue package to Brazil, the general mood was less
somber than three months ago.
</P>
<P>
For some countries, including Japan, Brazil and Russia, the
outlook has deteriorated more significantly. The growth
projections for some of the Asian emerging market economies in
crisis have also been lowered somewhat further, indicating that
the improved prospects for recovery may not materialize until well
into 1999. An exception is Thailand, where GDP is now projected to
rise steadily, though slowly, throughout 1999, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The document notes that "among the most encouraging aspects of
the baseline scenario are the continued solid growth performance,
despite modest downward revisions, of the United States and the
future euro area, although there are downside risks in both
cases."
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the IMF new report also raised its growth
projection for China, which reflecting stronger-than-expected
performance in the second half of 1998, partly in response to
policy stimulus. "In China and Hong Kong SAR, the successful
maintenance of the exchange regimes has helped to restore
stability in Asian financial markets," the IMF noted.

LONDON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A Dutch student completely
paralyzed in a road accident was awarded damages of 9.2 million
pounds, the High Court in London ruled on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Martijn Biesheuvel had hopes of a high-flying career in
business destroyed by the crash, the court was told.
</P>
<P>
The payout is the largest personal injury award made by an
English court.
</P>
<P>
Biesheuvel was 22 and had just finished final exams in business
administration at Bath University in May 1994 when a car in which
he was traveling with four friends collided with parked vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Nobody else was seriously hurt in the crash in the city.
</P>
<P>
The insurers of driver Andrew Birrell will pay the award, which
includes loss of future earnings and the cost of care.
</P>
<P>
It was accepted that Birrell's negligence caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
Biesheuvel was not wearing a rear seatbelt but in court,
Justice Eady said: "I am wholly unpersuaded that I should make a
finding of contributory negligence against Mr Biesheuvel."

<HEADLINE> Multi-sectoral Approach to AIDS Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean National AIDS
Coordinating Program (NACP) is calling for a multi-sectoral
approach to create AIDS awareness and avoid further spread of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The approach would invite government ministries, churches and
non-governmental organizations to participate in AIDS awareness
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency here Monday,
NACP youth coordinator, Zorodzai Gumbie said the magnitude of
human life devastation by AIDS is making it imperative that
everyone should play a part in finding the means to curb the
disease.
</P>
<P>
"Responsibility should not be left to the Ministry of Health
and Child Welfare alone but every one should cooperate," Gumbie
said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed the need to intensify campaigns in rural areas
where there was limited media access.
</P>
<P>
Gumbie added that AIDS education should be made imperative at
every level of the existing education structures in schools to
equip children with enough information about AIDS before they
contracted it.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is the second to Botswana on the world list of
countries worst affected by AIDS. About 1.4 million adults, 25.8
percent of sexually active adults between 15 and 49 years are
thought to be HIV positive. More than 700 people die every week
from HIV/AIDS-related illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Annan Have not Lost Hope With Libya on Lockerbie Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Monday that it is regrettable that the
Lockerbie issue had not been solved before the 10th anniversary,
which falls on Monday, but he is still hopeful to get positive
response from Libya on the 1988 Locker bombing.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters
here on Monday morning, Annan said, "My message to them (the
families of victims) is that it is regrettable that 10 years after
the event, we have not been able to get to the truth so that they
can put this behind them, mourn their dead and carry on with their
lives."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks on the 10th anniversary of the Lockerbie
bombing, which involved the explosion of a Pam Am airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland, taking 270 lives.
</P>
<P>
"But I am still hopeful that we will get a positive decision
from the Libyan Government," he said, "I had hoped it would come
before this date -- the anniversary -- but I have not lost hope.
And they should not."
</P>
<P>
Annan, who paid a visit to Libya in early December, failed to
persuade Libya into surrendering the two suspects, but the U.N.
chief remains hopeful for a proper solution.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan top legislature, the Libyan General People's
Congress, issued a statement on December 15, calling for a
peaceful solution to the Lockerbie bombing, and calling on the
United States and Britain to clear away all obstacles in the trial
of the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
Libyan has agreed to let the two suspected Libyans be tried
before a Scottish court in the Netherlands, but it held that the
two Libyans, if convicted, should not serve their sentences in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for failing to
hand over to the trial of the Netherland-based court two suspects
in the Lockerbie bombing.

<HEADLINE> Chief U.N. Arms Inspector Says Not to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. arms
inspector Richard Butler said on Monday that he would stay in his
post despite Iraq's strong call for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused Butler, Executive Chairman of the United
Nations Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction, of coordinating with the United States by
reporting that Iraq had failed to cooperate fully with the United
Nations, which directly led to the four-day U.S. military strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Butler said "Any suggestion that I
cooked the books or colluded with the Untied States for this
purpose is without foundation."
</P>
<P>
"I could take you through site by site and I can show you that
in every case there was a disarmament justification for going to
that site. They were my choices. They were based on facts. I did
not discuss them with the Unite States or anyone else," he said.
</P>
<P>
Butler said he would not resign in the face of the criticism.
</P>
<P>
"Now there is no reason for me to do that. The very idea that
my presence in this job can be used as a diversion from Iraq's
failure to give us the information we need... that somehow this
comes down to one individual, I am sorry that is such a
diversionary tactic and there would be no reason to resign in the
face of that," he added.

<HEADLINE> Report: Russian Ambassadors to Return to U.S., </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador to the
United States Yuly Vorontsov will probably return to Washington in
"one to two days," Interfax reported Monday, quoting Foreign
Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov and Russian Ambassador to Britain, Yuri Fokin, were
recalled last Friday for consultations in light of U.S.-British
airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The recalls were seen as a protest against the missile raids,
which Moscow has all along staunchly opposed.
</P>
<P>
Fokin will probably return to London this week, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors will resume their work "because they have
completed their consultations in Moscow," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow reacted angrily at the military actions, which President
Boris Yeltsin said had "flagrantly violated the United Nations
Charter" and norms of international law.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Interfax quoted a source in the
Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday that Moscow will not propose
that the U.N. Security Council adopt a draft resolution to condemn
the U.S.-British strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's position on this military operation is clear. But the
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have the veto
power," the source said.
</P>
<P>
However, at the U.N. Security Council's meeting on Monday
evening, Moscow time, Russia will insist that further steps be
taken to ensure the implementation of the council's resolutions on
Iraq by all sides and that political methods be found to deal with
the situation in the wake of the air strikes, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is not going to insist that the U.N. Security Council
lift international sanctions against Iraq at the present time, but
it will propose that humanitarian aid to Iraq be discussed,
Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Slim Chance Seen for U.K.'s Containment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Although British Prime Minister
Tony Blair expressed his confidence in a "policy of containment"
on Iraq, dim prospect can be seen in the implementation of the
strategy due to growing domestic and international divergences.
</P>
<P>
Citing the three-day air strikes against Iraq which he noted
has realized all expected objectives, Blair said Sunday that
Saddam's strength and Iraq's capability to produce and use weapons
of mass destruction were decimated, which provided the best
opportunity for further containment on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The three main points of the strategy include further military
strikes when necessary, more intensive enforcement of sanctions
and the dispatch of the British aircraft carrier "Invincible" to
the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Blair said Britain would strengthen its cooperation with the
U.N. Security Council, the Gulf countries and the European Unions
members, and would continue to assist the Iraq opposition to help
remove Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The new strategy sounds good, but analysts here cast pessimism
on its expected results.
</P>
<P>
Blair's opposition Conservatives have already pounced on
apparent discrepancies in his vision and reality.
</P>
<P>
"He (Blair) called for a more intensive enforcement of sanctions,
but how is that any easier today than it was a week ago?" asked a
Conservative spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it won't be easy now to get support from Britain's
partners in Europe to reinforce the sanctions. French President
Jacques Chirac called for a review on Sunday of the eight-year oil
embargo against Baghdad in order to improve living conditions for
the people in Iraq. The same words had been heard even before the
strikes were launched.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the U.S. bypassed the U.N. Security Council in
ordering the air strikes, making some members of the Security
Council outrage at the ignorance. China condemned the military
action and Russia called back its ambassadors to the U.S. and
Britain to protest against the strikes. Time will be needed to
repair Britain's relations with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Repair work will also be needed on Britain's image in the
Islamic and Arab world, where governments have been unwilling to
support the Blair-Clinton strategy since the attacks were
unleashed shortly before the outset of the muslim holy month of
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
It's also hard to say how much Britain can rely on Iraq
opposition groups. Britain tried to persuade members of Iraq's
fragmented opposition to work together last month but they still
failed to combine their strengths to oust Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
British reinforcements in the Gulf won't do much to suppress
Iraq. The United States and Britain have been keeping their forces
in that region for years, but little has been done to prevent
Saddam Hussein from playing the "cat and mouse game." What can they
possibly expect to achieve by sending one more aircraft carrier
there?

<HEADLINE> Greece Likely to Settle Name Disputes With Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece is likely to settle its
disputes with Macedonia by accepting the name "Republic of
Macedonia-Skopje" for the neighboring Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Parliament debate Monday, Stelios Papathemelis, a
ruling party MP for Thessaloniki, said that the Greek government
appeared to be ready to accept the name for the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), according to the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA).
</P>
<P>
Papathemelis said that he got a document issued recently by the
Greek Finance Ministry's customs department showing that the code
for Macedonia would change from the present XJ to MK as of January
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Macedonia have been at odds for years over their
disputes of the name of "Macedonia" because Athens opposes the use
by Skopje of the name "Macedonia," saying that it conceals
expansionist designs against its northern province of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two neighboring countries have been
improving in recent years, especially since they signed an interim
agreement in New York in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two countries agreed to continue their
U.N.-sponsored negotiations to find a mutually acceptable solution
for the name issue.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between Greece and Macedonia is expected to exceed
250 million U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said Monday that he was not aware of the documents cited by
Papathemelis while stressing that the solution of the name issue
with Skopje was being sought within the framework of negotiations
being conducted under U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos will on Tuesday
begin his one-day visit to Macedonia and have talks with
Macedonian government officials on ways of improving bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Civil Service Urged to Fully Implement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi said Monday that much is expected from the civil
service in successfully implementing policies adopted by
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting organized here to discuss ways to ensure
the participation of government offices in the on-going civil
service reform program, which was attended by ministers and heads
of various government offices, Meles urged the civil service to
see to it that the policies are put into effect.
</P>
<P>
The official Ethiopian News Agency quoted Meles as saying that
the civil service reform program would help ensure quality of
services, circumvent mis-demeanour and find a way to reward
competent civil servant.
</P>
<P>
Meles stressed the need to boost capacity in order to properly
execute on-going development activities and emphasised the role
of the civil service reform program in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The civil service inherited from previous regimes not only
failed to execute the decisions of parliament, but also
regard itself as a policy maker, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meles noted that building a mass-based federal system is one
important task in the political field, adding that rehabilitating
the economy and helping farmers who account for 85 percent of the
total population of the country be beneficiaries of social
services are also priority areas.
</P>
<P>
He added that a competent executive body is important to
guarantee success in the socio-economic and political fields.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Expounds Peace Policy in Crucial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- At a crucial meeting of the
Israeli Knesset (parliament), Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
Monday expounded his policy in the peace talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The plenum of the Knesset, which opened Monday afternoon, is
due to vote later on a bill calling for dissolution of the
Knesset and early elections.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that Israel had handed over some
territories to the Palestinians in the first phase of the
withdrawal according to the Wye peace accord signed with the
Palestinians two months ago.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) failed
to fulfill its commitments to fight terrorism and avoid
unilateral activities.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reiterated his conditions to further implement the
agreement, which were approved by the Israeli cabinet on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the conditions, the PNA must stop violence
against Israel, collect all illegal weapons in the territories,
reduce the number of the Palestinian police, renounce unilateral
statement over statehood and agree to Israel's stance on the
release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that most of the Israeli people support his
policy. And he called on the opposition Labor Party to express
support too.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that if his policy will not be favored
by a majority of the Knesset, the Knesset should be dissolved
and early elections should be held.
</P>
<P>
He also said that at his request the no-confidence motion,
which was added on the early elections bill two weeks ago,
will not be included in the vote.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Likud Party announced on Monday that
it will also vote for the early elections bill.
</P>
<P>
If the bill is approved by the Knesset, the Knesset will
be dissolved and the elections for prime minister will be held
within six months.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Civilians Suffer Much from Fighting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The fighting in Kuito City,
provincial capital of Angola's central Bie Province has brought
much casualties among local residents, said a report reaching
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Sabono Salongue, head of Bie Hospital in
Kuito City, as saying that the hospital has treated over 260
injured civilians in the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
At present, the hospital is running out of medicines and food,
and Salongue is calling for immediate international aid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, since most doctors, local and foreign, have fled
the city, the patients can only receive basic treatment, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Kuito has been the center where the most fierce fighting took
place since mid November between the government troops and the
forces of the opposition National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
According to Monday's Journal of Angola, UNITA Chairman Jonas
Savimbi's troops have stopped bombarding and only sporadic
shootings were heard after government forces launched a counter
attack against the rebels surrounding the city.
</P>
<P>
The reinforced government troops on December 13 launched
massive attacks on the town of Cruzeiro, 35 kilometers south of
Kuito, releasing the pressure upon the defenders.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper acknowledged that it is still too early to
say that Kuito has been rescued from the siege by the UNITA
troops since the routes linking the city with the outside world
are still controlled by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
UNITA reinforcements are reported to have massed toward Kuito,
apparently preparing to mount new attacks on the city.
</P>
<P>
There have been big-scale conflicts again between the
government army and the UNITA forces in the central provinces of
Huambo and Bie in the past month and more.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government accused the UNITA of launching attacks
first by using tanks, armored vehicles, long-range artillery and
surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA has got the upper hand by occupying most parts of
the two provinces of Huambo and Bie and the Angolan government
army has to retreat so as to defend the capital cities of the two
provinces.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Appoints New Army Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's new cabinet Monday
issued the first batch of appointments for key posts, including
the country's army commander.
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Michel Suleiman, a Maronite Catholic, was promoted
to full general and named as the new army commander to replace
Gen. Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, also a Maronite Catholic, was elected president on
October 15 after nine years of service as army commander.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was announced by Information Minister Anwar
Khalil following the first meeting of the cabinet of 16
predominantly technocrat ministers since it won a vote of
confidence in Parliament last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brig. Jamil El-Sayyed, Shiite Muslim, was promoted to
Lt. General and named head of the General Security Department.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since Lebanon gained independence from
France 55 years ago that a Shiite Muslim takes this sensitive post
from Maronite.
</P>
<P>
According to Lebanon's constitution, the top posts should be
equally divided among Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims and Maronite
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
The country's president always comes from Maronite, prime
minister from Sunni Muslim and house speaker from Shiite Muslim.
</P>
<P>
Catholic Brig. Edward Mansour was promoted to Lt. General and
appointed chief of the State Security Department, a traditionally
Shiite post.
</P>
<P>
Brig. Abdulkarim Ibrahim, a Sunni, was promoted to Lt. General
and named police chief, while Brig. Nasser Rahban, a Maronite, was
named commander of the gendarmerie, countryside police.
</P>
<P>
Observers praised the appointments, saying the new government
is trying to break the country's traditionally sectarian politics
and appoint top officials on the basis of their qualifications
and honesty, rather than along their religious lines.

<HEADLINE> Annan on Healing Work in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Monday that he will try to get Security Council
members together to work out the ways of dealing with the
situation after U.S. and British military attacks against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"It is not helpful that the Council is divided, and I would
hope that in the weeks ahead we will find a way of bringing
everyone together, so that we can carry on the essential work of
the Council," Annan told reporters when entering the U.N.
headquarters Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said he had been on the phone with some of the leaders
around the world over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The four-day military strikes without a U.N. endorsement, have
been blasted by several Council members as the actions are against
the U.N. Charter and the norms guiding international relations.
</P>
<P>
Annan said Wednesday, when the air-strikes began, "it is a sad
day for the U.N. and the world". The actions ended on Saturday,
leaving the Council heavy divided on issues relating to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On the resumption of U.N. arms inspections in Iraq, Annan said
he believes that the answer to the question of whether a new
inspection mechanism should emerge will come out after Council
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Council members, including Russia and China, have criticized
chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler for his biased report
which the U.S. and Britain took as the pretext to launch military
actions. France has called for a new inspection organization and
new methods of inspection.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials said if the prolonged sanctions against Iraq
continue in their current form, no inspections will be allowed,
especially under Butler.
</P>
<P>
"You've heard all the discussions going on -- several
governments saying that we need a new structure, we need a new
inspection mechanism," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what that means, I don't know what that entails,
and I don't know what kind of structure they have in mind. But it
will emerge after the discussions," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Council began their first post-Iraqi-bombing closed-door
session Monday morning on its relations with Iraq, focusing on
economic sanctions, arms inspections and a relief program intended
to aid Iraqis suffering under the eight-year sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Without giving details, Annan said he had sent a message to
Deputy Iraqi Prime Minister Tariq Aziz through his special envoy
Prakash Shah and he is waiting for a reaction.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.N. official said U.N. relief workers evacuated after
the anti-Iraq military actions are expected to come back to
Baghdad by Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Explains Casualties in U.S.-British Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz called the U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq as a
"criminal aggression" aimed at bringing country back to the
pre-industrial age.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here Monday that 38 of the
Republican Guards died and 100 wounded during the intensive air
strikes from Wednesday to Saturday. The elite guards were
considered as a strong pillar of the Iraqi regime and one of the
main targets of the air raids.
</P>
<P>
As to the casualties of the army, he said that 65 died and 180
injured.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not give the exact figure of civilian
casualties, saying the damage was similar to that in the 1991 Gulf
War and the almost all the industrial sites were pounded.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. and Britain targeted civilian and government
buildings, radio and TV facilities, communication institutions,
hospitals and schools.
</P>
<P>
He accused the two countries of carrying out their "imperialist
and colonialist" policy against Iraq and tramping on international
laws and all moral norms.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will "never, never accept any condition made by
(U.S. President Bill) Clinton and (British Prime Minister Tony)
Blair as to a resumption of UNSCOM work in Iraq, Aziz said. The
U.N. Special Commission oversees the destruction of all prohibited
weapons in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
When the U.S. and Britain bombed Iraq, "they killed UNSCOM," he
said. "UNSCOM is their own casualty, not ours," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Lifting the sanctions completely is Iraq's solution to the
situation," he said. The crippling sanctions was imposed on Iraq
after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"After the comprehensive and severe aggression in 1991,
thousands of interviews, thousands of inspections, the imposition
of no-fly zones, there came the Operation Desert Fox. so how the
United states and Britain expect to resume weapons inspections? "
he asked.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq strongly believes that the United States has
only suspended the attack and not ended it.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, the aggression never stopped since the 1991
Gulf War to evict Iraq out of Kuwait, and cited the economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"It has never stopped. It has taken different chapters, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
He ridiculed Clinton for saying that the United States took
Islamic sensitivities into consideration while planning the attack
and ending it on the first day of the holy month of Ramadan when
Muslims are required to fast.
</P>
<P>
"The question is not Ramadan, The question is that they had
assembled a limited amount of assets ... and they wanted to make a
swift and quick aggression, " he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to contain Iraq from development is the conspiracy
of the United states and Zionists, who take the Arabs as whole as
their enemies in this region, "Iraq is the first and Syria and
Libya may be their next targets."
</P>
<P>
On the fate of UNSCOM, he said that the current UNSCOM is not a
body of the U.N. Security Council, because the U.N. chief Kofi
Annan does not know its activities. UNSCOM has been serving as a
tool in the imperialists' hands against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As to the U.S. statements to change the government of Iraq, he
said that the Iraqi government is a free and independent
government. It has nothing to do with the U.S. as what kind of
government Iraq should have. He said that the U.S. is determined
to change Iraqi government because Iraq has not done anything to
bring down the oil prices from 21 dollars a barrel to less than 10
dollars. Instead, it has been challenging the U.S. imperialist
policies which seeking hegemony in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is foolish to believe that sending several
hundreds of missiles on Iraq would trigger uprising against the
Iraqi government. He said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is
beloved by the Iraqi people for the past decades and he is still
the strong and trusted leader of the nation.

<HEADLINE> November Industrial Output Drops 9.1 Percent in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia's industrial output
stood at 161 billion rubles (7.6 billion U.S. dollars) in
November, down 9.1 percent from the same period last year, the
State Statistics Committee said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the first eleven months of the year, overall industrial
output dropped by 5.0 percent as compared with the same period of
1997, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
All industrial branches in the first eleven months of 1998,
except the polygraphic industry, showed signs of decline. The
production of electricity dropped by 1.6 percent, fuel by 2.7
percent, ferrous metals by 8.4 percent, non-ferrous metals by 4.7
percent, chemicals and petroleum products by 7.1 percent, machines
and metal parts 7.6 percent, wood, timber, pulp and paper by 26.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Materov, the first deputy economics minister, sounded
optimistic, saying that industrial decline will end between the
first and second half of next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the devaluation of the ruble will be one of the factors
of the forthcoming production growth, as a weaker ruble helped
boost export and cut down import.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Agricultural production in January to November
decreased by 9.0 percent and the country registered the worst
harvest in more than four decades.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary reports, Russia's gross grain
harvest was 48.5 million tons, 45.3 percent down from 1997's
figure of 88.6 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Temporarily Suspends Privatization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's parliament has
resolved that the privatization process of public enterprises be
temporarily suspended.
</P>
<P>
Members of parliament made the resolution Monday after winding
up a debate on the report of the select committee on
privatization, the Radio Uganda reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in response to reports of rampant
corruption of senior government officials in the privatization
exercise following Major General Salim Saleh's recent confession
of irregular purchase of Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB).
</P>
<P>
Saleh, a former senior presidential advisor on defense and
security and younger brother of President Yoweri Museveni, was
found to have bought UCB fraudulently two weeks ago, which, in
Museveni's words, raised the curtain for the country's renewed
fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's session, MPs also resolved that the president
relieve Sam Kuteesa, who is State Minister in charge of
investment, of his duties in government should he declines to
resign.
</P>
<P>
They wanted the sales contract of Trans-Ocean, UCB and Uganda
Airlines revoked forthwith because corruption is reported to be
found in the sale of these big parastatals of the country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's divestiture account had a balance of only 4.8 million
U.S. Dollars by September 30 although the 87 parastatals so far
sold have fetched some 110.8 million Dollars for the state
coffers.

<HEADLINE> Beckenbauer: Germans Football Have Lost Their Supremacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- German football-team has lost its
position as one of the world's soccer powers, The "Emperor" of the
German Football Franz Beckenbauer said in a German sports magazine
 published Monday.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer, who was the German national team-captain of the 1974
World Cup winners and coach of the 1990 world champions, is now the
Bayern Munixh president.
</P>
<P>
He told in a interview of the magazine, the Germans had been "too
complacent" and other countries had now overtaken them.
</P>
<P>
European champions Germany have won the World Cup three times - in
1954, 1974 and 1990 - and have also been losing finalists three times,
but played disappointingly at France 98 before being eliminated by
Croatia in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer believed, "the others have learned from us and have now
rushed by. The others are better on the ball, ours aren't able to
play." He said, too: "the Germans have lost their supremacy. We did
not see the signs, we were too complacent."
</P>
<P>
The main problem was in bringing on young talent, according to
Beckenbauer. He rejected also the argument that average foreign
players were blocking the progress of good young players.
</P>
<P>
"Our junior players only have themselves to blame. These foreigners
are only playing because our young players are too weak. The mistakes
are happening in youth team training," he said.

<HEADLINE> Butler Says not to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler said on Monday that he would not resign
despite criticism.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for me to do that," he told NBC's "Today,s
Show" in a interview. "The very idea that my presence in this job
can be used as a diversion from Iraq's failure to give us the
information we need... that somehow this comes down to one
individual, I'm sorry that is such a diversionary tactic and there
would be no reason to resign in the face of that."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused Butler of being used as a pawn by the United
States and Britain, who launched four-day bombing campaign against
Iraq last week after they were informed in advance of the report
that Butler would submitted to the Security Council about Iraq's
non-cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Butler maintained that his report to the Security Council was
his and his alone.
</P>
<P>
"I could take you through site by site and I can show you that
in every case there was a disarmament justification for going to
that site. They were my choices. They were based on facts. I did
not discuss them with the United States or anybody else," he said.

<P>
ANKARA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy would not grant political
asylum to the Turkish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan and may try him
in Europe or expel him to a third country, Italian Industry
Minister Pierluigi Bersani reiterated here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bersani, who arrived here Monday morning made the remarks after
meeting with his Turkish counterpart Yalim Erez.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Italian political and economic ties soured after
Italy rejected a Turkish warrant for the extradition of Abdullah
Ocalan, leader of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK),
who was detained by the Italian police when he arrived in Rome
from Moscow on November 12.
</P>
<P>
Turkey businesses have imposed an unofficial embargo on Italian
goods, which has caused the Italian companies to lose an estimated
200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>

"We have received letters from hundreds of Italian companies
that they were in trouble," Bersani said. "Our aim is to solve
this problem within the limits of the Italian Laws while
considering the feelings of the Turkish people," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Italian minister expressed the hope that his meeting with
Erez would help remove the obstacles that have hindered bilateral
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish government has made no decision to boycott Italian
goods although we have the right to do so in government
procurements," Erez said. "On the contrary, we want to boost our
economic ties with Italy."
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who leads the PKK fighting a 14-year-old separatist war
in southeastern Turkey, was forced to leave Syria where he had
been stayed for years. Turkey was on the verge of a war with Syria
in October for Syrian support to and shelter the PKK leaders.
</P>
<P>
Italy is Turkey's second largest trading partner in Europe and
Turkey is eager to join in the European Union (EU).

<HEADLINE> Arab League Welcomes Yemen's Call for Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) welcomes an
appeal by Yemen to hold an Arab summit to examine the current Arab
situation, said Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh is consulting with other
Arab leaders on the proposal, Abdel-Meguid told a press conference
after meeting with Arab countries' representatives to the league.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the Cairo-based league on Sunday, Yemen asked
AL to call an emergency Arab summit to review the situation in the
Arab world, especially after the U.S.-British air strikes against
Iraq since Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The last Arab summit was held in June 1996 in Cairo, one month
after hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took
office, to discuss the challenges that the Arab world was facing.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Algeria have expressed support for holding the
proposed Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid urged the United Nations Security Council to play
a decisive role in dealing with the Iraqi issue and live up to its
responsibilities rather than leave the field open to the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have turned a deaf ear to the Arab cries
of anger and resentment. Many people in the Arab countries
denounced as unacceptable the U.S.- British aggression against
Iraq and the brutal killings of Iraqi people, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON December 21 (Xinhua) - The major European stock markets
staged steady gains Monday with the dollar holding its ground and
shares surging in light year-end trade.
</P>
<P>
The markets were boosted by a bullish start on a Wall Street
apparently confident of President Clinton's political survival.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 Index of leading shares started off in
positive territory and surged ahead throughout the day to close at
5875, up 134.6 on the day.
</P>
<P>
Germany's blue-chip Xetra Dax index rose over 3 percent as
traders said Wall Street's ability to shrug off the US president's
impeachment augured well for German shares.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax index closed up 159.96 at 4826.70. The Dow's 1.7
percent surge and the dollar's bounce back above DM1.67 helped
cement the positive tone.
</P>
<P>
French stocks also soared in thin volume, riding the wave of
enthusiasm which started in the US. The Cac 40 index closed up
111.52 points at 3803.41.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the year-end rally came amid a belief on Wall
Street that the Senate will not convict Clinton, whose approval
rating remains high in public opinion polls.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia will review its plan for
military contacts with the U.S. and Britain for next year in light
of the latest events involving Iraq, a senior Russian military
officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, Leonid Ivashov, head of the Defense Ministry's
International Cooperation Department, said Moscow will not break
off mutually advantageous cooperation, but the intensity may be
lowered, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"We will not simulate good relations after what has occurred,"
Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
On Russia's ties with NATO, Ivashov said Moscow "will try to
persuade the alliance and its members to discuss serious and
concrete issues involving mutual and European security."
</P>
<P>
The military actions in Iraq "will not influence the plans for
opening a NATO mission in Moscow," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov said the technical side of the issue was finalized and
that the two sides have agreed on the premises for the mission.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian Foreign Ministry and NATO structures are dealing
with legal aspects," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that NATO "distanced itself from the action against
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"The relevant conclusions and corrections will be made by the
Russian military. All maneuvers used against Iraq will be taken
into consideration," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Minister Puts Off Visit to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Energy and
Water Hani Mulki has decided to put off his visit to Iraq at the
request of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The postponement of the visit, slated for December 22, was the
result of the U.S and British air strikes on Iraq last week, Mulki
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Mulki said the attacks, growing out of disputes between the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and Baghdad, have complicated the
circumstances surrounding the annual meeting between Jordanian and
Iraqi ministers on Iraq's oil supply to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched four successive nights of air
strikes on Iraq with the declared aim to destroy Iraq's military
capabilities and to avenge its defiance of UNSCOM, which is
authorized to monitor Iraq's disarming of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The minister said oil supply from Iraq to Jordan was unaffected
and actually more oil was shipped.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan received 117,000 tonnes of oil from Iraq on
December 18 when the bombardment was under way, as against the
usual average 105,000 tonnes a day.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the kingdom's strategic stock of oil
and oil products could be used for one month.
</P>
<P>
After the Gulf War ended in 1991, sparked by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, Jordan imported 75,000 barrels of crude oil
everyday from Iraq with the consent of the U.N., which imposed
sanctions on Iraq eight years ago, but has allowed Iraq to export
a limited amount of oil since 1996 to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 percent of Iraqi crude oil was granted to Jordan, and
50 percent was bartered with food, cooking oil, medicine and other
goods at discounted prices.

<HEADLINE> Analysis:  UN Inspectors Unlikely to Return to Iraq Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- As the United States
and Britain announced the end of their military Strikes against
Iraq on December 19, the question on when the United Nations arms
inspectors would return to Iraq and resume their work has become a
hot topic here at the headquarters of the United Nations. Signs
have shown that there is very little possibility that the UN arms
inspectors could go back to Iraq in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, after hit by the four-day long U.S. military actions, has
reiterated on many occasions that it would not allow U.N.
inspectors to come back until the U.N. sanctions gets lifted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq held that it has cooperated fully with the United Nations
and has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction in
accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions, and the eight-year
sanctions should have been lifted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq argued that the sanctions have been kept in place for so
long because chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler, who is
accused by Iraq of coordinating with the U.S. Administration's
policies against Iraq, has blocking the process by drawing
negative reports on Iraq's efforts in disarmament and cooperation
with the Untied Nations.
</P>
<P>
Butler, Executive Chairman of the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, and Iraq has been at odds over the weapons
inspections these years, which led to several military
confrontations between Iraq and the United States, and the
U.S.-led military strikes have made it impossible for Iraq to deal
directly with Butler, and it also made it impossible for Iraq to
allow the U.N. weapons inspectors headed by Butler to return.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said Butler, who reported that U.N. did not get full and
unconditional support from Iraq as it promised last week, prompted
the U.S.-led military strikes and he is not welcome to the country
any longer.
</P>
<P>
The frequent looming of crisis between Iraq and Butler has
seized attention of the United Nations Security Council, which has
began to doubt the effectiveness and fairness of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the International Atomic Energy Agency, UNSCOM
made very little progress in its work after eight years in Iraq,
that is strong criticized by Council members, namely China, Russia
and France.
</P>
<P>
Russia requested the Security Council have a complete review of
the current working mechanism of UNSCOM and Butler be fired, and
France suggested a new institution to replace UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
But the United States and Britain defended Butler and his
UNSCOM as effective and professional. They want to keep Butler in
the post, and they want UNSCOM to return to Iraq to resume its
work.
</P>
<P>
It is widely seen here that the United Nations arms inspectors
would not return to Iraq in the near future amid Iraq's strong
demands and the Council's sharp division on UNSCOM.

<HEADLINE> Britain, U.S. Warn of Further Action Against Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain and the United
States warned Libya Monday, which is the 10th anniversary of the
1988 Lockerbie bombing, that they could seek additional measures
if it failed by next February to hand over two suspects in the
case for trial.
</P>
<P>
In statements to the Security Council, which held closed-door
consultations Monday morning, the British and U.S. envoys both
said that they are running out their patience.
</P>
<P>
Libya accepted in August a Washington-London proposal to try
the two Libyans before a Scottish court in the Netherlands. The
two suspects were accused of planting a bomb aboard the American
airliner which later exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing
270 people.
</P>
<P>
At issue is the dispute on the place where the two, if
convicted, should serve their sentences. Libya has been demanding
that they, if found guilty, should not serve their sentences in
Scotland, as proposed by Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Our patience is not unlimited," said Jeremy Greenstock, the
British permanent representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"In February, the Security Council will hold its regularly
scheduled review of Libyan sanctions," Peter Burleigh, charge
d'affaires of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, said.
</P>
<P>
"If by that time, the government of Libya has not handed over
the suspects for trial before a Scottish court in the Netherlands,
we will seek additional measures to compel compliance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he is
still hopeful to get a positive response from the Libyan
government on the Lockerbie issue.

<P>
Los Angeles, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The world's first
octuplets to be born alive remain in critical condition in a
hospital in Houston, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Texas Children's Hospital said Monday that the first baby was
born 12 days ago at a local hospital specialized in high risk
pregnancies and multiple births, and then transferred to the
Children's. The other seven babies were born on Sunday, December
20.
</P>
<P>
The parents are American citizens originally from Nigeria, said
the hospital, adding that the babies are expected to be
hospitalized at Texas Children's for at least two months before
being well enough to go home. The mother had taken fertility drugs
and had been told to expect multiple births.
</P>
<P>
According to the hospital, the seven babies born Sunday were 13
weeks premature and delivered by Cesarean section. The baby born
on December 8 was 15 weeks premature and delivered vaginally.
</P>
<P>
Still unnamed, the six baby girls and two boys have their
birthweights ranging between 320 and 810 grams. The biggest is a
boy, the seventh baby, and the smallest, a girl, both born on
Sunday. The eldest baby, a girl with the birthweight of 690 grams,
is now off the ventilator. The other seven babies are all
breathing with the assistance of ventilators, the hospital said.

<HEADLINE> Leading Businessman Kidnapped in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A leading businessman was
kidnapped in the breakaway republic of Chechnya Monday, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Salambek Khadzhiyev, head of the Chechengazprom Gas Department,
was captured by a group of armed persons wearing camouflage, the
Chechen Shariah Security Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapping might have been committed to force gas workers
to begin protesting and cut off gas supplies to the population,
thus triggering social unrest, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred Chechengazprom employees held a rally Monday
evening to demand the release of Khadzhiye.
</P>
<P>
Another motive might be to seek a ransom, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapping came just after the Chechen authorities decided
to halt operations against illegal armed gangs at the start of
Ramadan, which started Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, Shariah State Security Minister Nasrudi Bazhiyev said
that "if armed groups show signs of activity, operations will be
resumed to the former scale without warning."
</P>
<P>
The breakaway republic has been plagued by abductions in recent
years. The victims included federal government officials, ordinary
residents and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Three Britons and a New Zealander, abducted in October, were
found beheaded on December 8, the first killing of foreign
hostages in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said in
November that some 700 people were being kept hostage in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Organized criminal groups have distributed profitable
operations, some doing kidnapping, others whisking hostages away
and still others "providing maintenance, medical service and
food," Rushailo said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said here Monday that dialog is the first choice in
resolving conflicts worldwide.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when briefing foreign envoys here on his
country's foreign and domestic policies.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his worries over the escalating conflicts in
Angola, saying that the uncompromising Jonas Savimbi, who is the
belligerent head of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA), is the main factor for the instability and
degrading war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to the international community to make concerted
efforts to ensure the implementation of both the Lusaka Protocol
and the U.N. resolution on Angola. A lasting peace in Angola is
not only a contribution to the national stability, but also to
the stability in southern Africa and the whole continent," said
Chissano.
</P>
<P>
On the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
Chissano said he was encouraged by the prospects of peace in the
country, adding "We appreciate that an immediate ceasefire was
agreed at the African-French summit in Paris by all parties of the
conflict, which opens up a real possibility to the comprehensive
resolution to the conflicts in the Great Lakes region."
</P>
<P>
Regarding the domestic situation, the president said
Mozambique is politically stable with its people participating
more and more in the country's democratic life.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, said the president, despite its crippling foreign
debt, the economic growth in Mozambique continues its encouraging
trend and is expected to reach 11.2 percent this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Food supply in Africa is
expected to improve next year, according to a report of the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization released Monday in
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Above average to record harvests were anticipated in western Africa
and a satisfactory amount of food production was expected in eastern
Africa, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But 13 countries were expected to have severe food shortages, with
Somalia to be the worst hit. Last year, the number of such countries
were 20.
</P>
<P>
Mwita Rukandema, who launched the U.N. report, said a major food
crisis was developing in Somalia, with malnutrition cases, already
high, continuing to rise.
</P>
<P>
The report said: "Recent estimates put the number of people facing
food shortages (in Somalia) at 700,000, and those most at risk at
300,000."
</P>
<P>
Rukandema called on world countries to focus attention on the country.
</P>
<P>
Somalia's food crisis was caused by five consecutive bad harvests.
</P>
<P>
The strife-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola will
also have food problems, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy PM on U.S.-British Strikes, Fate of UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 21, (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said Monday that the U.S-British air strikes against
Iraq killed 62 soliders and wounded 180 others.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference on Monday evening that U.S
President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
boosted their military achievements, disinformed their people and
the world in order to justify their aggression.
</P>
<P>
He said the serious damage was in civilian sites, however he
did not give the exact figure of civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon had said over the weekend
that thousands of people were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. and Britain targeted industrial sites,
government and party buildings, schools, communications centers,
radio and TV stations, hospitals and private houses.
</P>
<P>
Iraq strongly believes that the U.S. and Britain have only
suspended the aggression but not ended it.
</P>
<P>
"The aggression has not stopped, it is continuing against
Iraq, " and it may resume after the holy month of Ramadan, said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
"The question is not Ramadan, they finished a limited amount
of missiles. It was part of the tactics that they suspended their
aggression," he added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz stressed that Iraq will "never accept any conditions made
by Clinton or Blair. Iraq refuses all these conditions totally
and strongly."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on Iraq's relations with the U.N., Aziz
said it was not Iraq but the U.S. and Britain that damaged the
U.N. itself.

"They damaged the power and the mandate of the U.N. Security
Council," he said, adding "they did not act according to
international law".
</P>
<P>
"It is their responsibility to rebuild their relations with
the international community and the U.N. Security Council," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S.-British aggression should be the main focus in
the discussions of the UN Security Council and the embargo imposed
on Iraq should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
On the fate of the U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq
(UNSCOM), Aziz said "the moment America and Britain launched
missiles against Iraq, they killed UNSCOM. So UNSCOM is their
casualty, not ours."
</P>
<P>
"After the comprehensive and severe aggression in 1991,
thousands of interviews, thousands of inspections, the imposition
of no-fly zones, there came the 'Operation Desert Fox'. So how
the U.S. and Britain expect to resume weapons inspections?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said "the aggressors wanted to change the government of
Iraq. How can they do this? It is a free and independent
government. They thought foolishly when they sent missiles,
thinking Iraqis will uprise against the leadership, these are
Rambo-like fantasies."

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Students to Re-sit for Tests After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government has set January 13-17 next year for students to re-sit
for the Form Four nationwide examinations which were suspended
last month following leakages of test papers.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued Monday in Dar es Salaam by the
Tanzania Information Services, the National Examination Council
is in final preparations for the exercise which will cost the
government about 800 million Shillings (about 1.2 million U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Form Four examination which started on
November 3 were nullified by the government on November 6
following leakages of the examination papers in 12 regions.
</P>
<P>
This time, the statement said, the government and its
instruments will be very careful in administering the
examinations.
</P>
<P>
It also warned anybody who tries to involve themselves in
examination leakage and cheating will be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
In a parliamentary session last month, the Act No.3 of the
National Security of 1970 was amended and the Section of National
Examinations was added, said the statement, adding that any
person who are found guilty of cheating in the examinations will
face a maximum of 20 years of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Minister of Education and Culture Juma Kapuya told
reporters that this was the first time the government has
disregarded and suspended a nationwide examination.
</P>
<P>
He said the syndicate originated in Rukwa Region in the
southwest. Unknown people broke into an office where the
examination papers were kept under custody at Rukwa High School.
They made away with history, geography, Kiswahili, English,
physics, chemistry, biology, basic mathematics, commerce and
book-keeping papers.
</P>
<P>
After stealing the papers, the culprits faxed them to the
other members of the syndicate and circulated them widely,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The police have held a dozen people in connection with the
incident.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Tanzanians Fall Victims to Witch-Hunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of elderly
people in several Lake Victoria regions in Tanzania have fallen
victims to witch-hunting, the Tanzania Media Women's Association
(TAMWA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Pius Wanzala,
a TAMWA program officer, said more than 1,000 people nationwide
were killed on allegations of witchcraft from 1994 to September
this year.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the report said, 7,727 people were killed
in all kinds of incidents across the country, 1,233 of which were
related to witch-hunting. Among the witch-hunting cases, 400
took place in the Shinyanga Region, with 90 percent of the dead
being elderly women.
</P>
<P>
Wanzala said many people would kill innocent elderly people
out of fear that they are witches who may threaten their lives
with super nature power, especially when people are ill.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to people in the region to abandon superstitious
ideas and stop indiscriminate killings, which are against human
rights and Tanzanian laws. The officer also called for improved
medical care and education services in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says "Desert Fox" Hit Hard at Iraq's Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain will produce evidence
over the next few days to show that the four-night-long air
strikes had hit hard at Iraq's military capability.
</P>
<P>
"We know that we have done considerable damage to the war
machine of Iraq...in the next few days evidence will be brought
forward from the battle damage assessments to show that is
absolutely correct," British Defense Secretary George Robertson
told a news conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said his ministry was scheduled to hold a further
news conference on Tuesday to provide further evidence.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials and British military commanders would
show that "while life appears to be going around as normal
inside Iraq, inside the military structures, there has been
immense damage and the impact has been very considerable
indeed."
</P>
<P>
Robertson was speaking alongside German Defense Minister
Rudolph Scharping during a break in meetings during Scharping's
first visit to London since taking office two months ago.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that Britain and the United States were
diplomatically isolated in their stance, saying that a meeting of
NATO defence ministers last week had been unanimous that "it was
necessary, albeit regrettable, to act militarily".
</P>
<P>
"There will be some debates about the political strategy in the
future...but I am sure we will find a common one," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The first ever mostly foreign
funded loan in China's own currency has been made to the Shanghai
Rubber Company, the country's largest tyre manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
The 80 million yuan (about U.S. 10 million dollars) loan was
organized by the British Standard Chartered Bank's Shanghai branch
working with a foreign banking syndicate.
</P>
<P>
The one-year loan, made in the yuan, follows China's central
bank's recent decision to allow Chinese and foreign banks to work
together in offering loans in the local currency.
</P>
<P>
The banks involved are the Banque de I'industrine et de Suez,
Shanghai-Paris International Bank along with three Chinese banks.
</P>
<P>
The Standard Chartered Bank, the oldest foreign bank in China,
which began operations in 1858, was among the first group of
foreign banks to win approval last year from the People's Bank of
China to handle RMB businesses.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Gulf States, Iran Boost Ties in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The year 1998 witnessed a
big boost in the relations between Iran and the members of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The two sides have been in discord
for nealy two decades.
</P>
<P>
A series of exchanges of visits and talks, which took place
mainly on the Saudi Arabia-Iran and Kuwait-Iran tracks,
characterize the process of rapproachement between the two sides
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance set up in
1981, groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), most of which are all oil-rich
countries.
</P>
<P>
Of all those visits, the trip to Saudi Arabia by former Iranian
president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani last February arrested general
attention in the region. He is the highest ranking Iranian
official who has visited one of the GCC states since Iran's 1979
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
During his trip to Saudi Arabia, Rafsanjani, who still remains
influential as a top advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Seyyed Ali Husseini Khamenei, held talks with Saudi officials on
ways of improving bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The former Iranian president voiced regret over the past
animosity between the two countries, saying "it's a pity that we
didn't have cooperation with Saudi Arabia all these years".
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and Saudi Arabia expressed the hope that they should
open a new chapter in their relations since the two countries play
important roles in the Islamic world, the Gulf region in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two giants in the Gulf region warmed up
following the election of President Mohammad Khatami last May, who
advocated friendly and peaceful co-existence among regional
countries.
</P>
<P>
Regarding his tour as "one of the most successful foreign
trips by our officials", Rafsanjani said that his visit "melted a
mountain of ice" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also tried to coordinate stances with Riyadh, the
Gulf heavyweight, over the world oil price crisis.
</P>
<P>
Differences remained between Iran and the GCC members,
especially Saudi Arabia on how to deal with the oil price crisis,
with Iran favoring additional output reductions while Saudi Arabia
calling for an extension of previous cuts until the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
But the crisis, which affected the economies of both Iran and
Saudi Arabia, forced the two sides, whose proven crude reserves
account for about 36 percent of the world's total, to narrow their
differences and come out with a unified stance.
</P>
<P>
The six GCC countries produce nearly 13.5 million barrels of
oil each day, or one fifth of the world's total. Their oil
reserves, which are estimated at 465 billion barrels, account for
45 percent of the total global oil resources.
</P>
<P>
The GCC members, whose economy depends heavily on oil earnings,
have suffered a hard hit in the current oil price slump resulting
from oversupply and flagging demand.
</P>
<P>
The oil price in January futures contracts for Brent crude -- a
widely watched benchmark -- fell to a record low of 9.92
U.S. dollars a barrel in London. Brent was selling for around 20
dollars a barrel as recently as 1997.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's tour was followed by a brief visit on March 14 to
Riyadh by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who went to
Saudi Arabia for three more times later in the year.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi delivered to Saudi leaders messages from Iranian
President Khatami each time he visited the kingdom. Khatami
expressed in his letters Iran's desire to enhance mutual
understanding and strengthen coordination in a bid to shore up the
world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
On May 26, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal paid a
three-day visit to Iran, during which he held talks with Iranian
President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Khatami praised the improving relations
between Tehran and Riyadh, saying that the ties would be
beneficial for the whole Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure this new trend which has started in the ties between
our two countries will have extraordinary results for the Islamic
world and bilateral ties," Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
Saud, for his part, expressed appreciation for Khatami's
foreign policy oriented toward establishing better ties with
Iran's Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"You have adopted a correct policy, and hence for this reason
your brothers in Saudi Arabia are extending their hands towards
you, and openly welcome your position on regional issues," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi foreign minister also signed during his visit with
his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi a memorandum of
understanding over future cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the Gulf Arab nations and Iran have been
tense until recently, as Iran accused the GCC states of allowing
western presence in the region, while the GCC states kept Tehran
at a distance for its export of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
But the ice began to thaw in the past year after Khatami, a
political moderate, was elected as the country's president by a
landslide in May.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, with unprecedented popular support, held out the olive
branch to the rest of the world. He launched a charm offensive in
the Gulf region and gave his foreign policy the priority to the
improvement of relations between Iran and its Gulf Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
On the Iran-Kuwait track, Iranian Majlis (parliament) Speaker
Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri arrived in Kuwait on April 27 on an
official visit.
</P>
<P>
As a goodwill gesture, Nouri assured Kuwait that Iran has "no
relations whatsoever with Iraq," adding that its relations with
Iraq did not go beyond the necessary follow-up concerning
U.N. Security Council resolutions related to the 1980-1988
Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay in Kuwait, the Iranian parliament
speaker also stressed the importance of exchange visits by
Iranian high-level officials and the Gulf Arab countries as "a
chance to open dialogue that would help to remove the existing
mistrust."
</P>
<P>
Analysts say a desperate need for regional security and
stability may have prompted the rapprochement process between
Iran and the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1980s, peoples in the Gulf region have
been suffering from wars and instability.
</P>
<P>
The eight-year-long Iran-Iraq war in 1980-1988 proved that both
sides were losers in terms of political and economic benefits, not
to mention the heavy costs resulting from the war itself.
</P>
<P>
On June 9, Kuwaiti Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammad Khaled
Al-Hamad Al-Sabah arrived in Tehran on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said in his meeting with the Kuwaiti minister that
"today before any other time, the region is in need of security
and stability, through cooperation and initiatives taken by all
the regional countries. We must eliminate factors leading to
tension and instability."
</P>
<P>
He said that the trip would be another step in expanding mutual
understanding which will in turn lead to further cooperation in
political, economic and security issues.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Iran have begun talks with UAE on a
thorny dispute over three Gulf islands, namely, Abu Musa and
Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
The islands are strategically located on the edge of the Strait
of Hormuz, which as the only way to the Gulf, much of the world's
oil ships have to pass through.
</P>
<P>
Iran seized the islands in 1971 as Britain wound up its
colonial rule in the region. Tehran later agreed to share
sovereignty over Abu Musa, the largest of the islands, with
Sharjah, one of seven emirates federated in the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between Tehran and Abu Dhabi were lowered
to the level of charge d'affaires in 1992 after the UAE lodged a
protest to Iran's full control on the islands of Abu Musa, the
Greater and Lesser Tunbs, over which both sides claimed full
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The two Tunbs are uninhabited, but Iran has set up military
bases on them. Abu Musa has a predominantly Persian population.
</P>
<P>
As a positive gesture to resolve the long-standing dispute,
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi flew to Abu Dhabi on May
23, where he held talks with UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan
Al-Nahyan and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed
al-Nahyan on the disputed islands.
</P>
<P>
Though no progress emerged from the talks, both sides
"expressed common view in creating an atmosphere of mutual trust
and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Political analysts in the region held that the momentum of the
GCC-Iran rapprochement will at least continue if not to be
accelerated in the years to come, since both Iran's comprehensive
economic reforms initiated last August and the economic
diversification programs in the GCC states need a stable and
peaceful environment.

<HEADLINE> EU Regrets U.S. Publication of Sanction List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
filed a complaint with the WTO regarding the publication by the
United States of a trade sanction's list on EU exports.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions could eventually cost the EU about 500 million
European Currency Units (ECU) (about 600 million U.S. dollars) in
trade.
</P>
<P>
A written statement issued on Tuesday quoted European
Commission Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan as saying that he
regretted "very much" that the U.S. had gone ahead with publishing
the list of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has regrettably chosen not to take a
multilateral path but rather to embark on unilateral trade
sanctions. These are specifically condemned by the World Trade
Organization (WTO) rules," said Brittan.
</P>
<P>
But the EU still hopes the U.S. will respond to the union's
desire to resolve the trade dispute "lawfully and amicably," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The union would "not like to play the game of sanctions, but
rather play the game according to its rules," a commission
spokesman said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
He said that though the publication of a sanction list was
illegal and arbitrary, the union would not put out a retaliatory
list of its own and would still sort out the issue through the
dispute settlement mechanism within the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The EU submitted their complaint to the Geneva-based WTO
against America's unilateralism on Monday, according to the
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Treat Calmly NATO's Expansion: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Defense Minister
Oleksandr Kuzmuk said on Monday that his country would "treat
calmly" the eastward expansion of NATO, stressing that every
independent nation "has the right to determine its position in a
union."
</P>
<P>
Kuzmuk made the remark while attending the Executive Council of
Defense Ministers of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) as an observer, reported the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
As the first country to dismantle their nuclear weapons,
Ukraine opposes the deployment of nuclear weapons among NATO's new
members, said Kuzmuk.
</P>
<P>
But Ukraine did not oppose the establishment nor the usage of
NATO military facilities in those countries, for this is "the
internal affairs of every country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are expected to be
adopted as the first new NATO member states at the NATO summit
scheduled on April next year in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has not raised the issue of joining NATO, said Kuzmuk,
but it is cooperating with NATO under the special partnership
charter signed by two sides in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Paleontologists from the
United States and India have discovered in the Himalayan foothills
a fossilized whale's jawbone and teeth.
</P>
<P>
The fossil suggests the newly found whale species, named
Himalayecetus subathuensis, may be about 53.5 million years old,
said scientists from the University of Rookee in India and the
University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
Reporting Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, they said the new species is 3.5 million years older
than a species found in Pakistan that had been regarded as the
most ancient whale fossil.
</P>
<P>
The fossils were found in a shallow, oyster-hearing marine
deposit in the vicinity of the Tethys Sea, an early sea once
separating the Indian subcontinent from the rest of Asia.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO Gift of Books Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of China's educational
establishments are to benefit from the donation of sets of the
internationally acclaimed Encyclopaedia Britannica by UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
The company that publishes the comprehensive set, known
colloquially as "the university without walls" has offered UNESCO
one thousand sets of the printed books for distribution throughout
the Asia-Pacific region, valued at 2.8 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony in Beijing's Great Hall of the People today, Mr
Corey McMahon, the managing director of Encyclopaedia Brittanica
(Australia) said that in an era which has so readily embraced
high technology for education, it is humbling to be reminded that
there are still those who have a desperate hunger for education
but do not have access to it through modern technology.
</P>
<P>
He announced that 447 sets of the encyclopaedia would be
distributed throughout China: some 268 copies will go to
Experimental Middle Schools in Beijing, Shanxi and Shaanxi, under
the Secondary School Joint Innovative Project co-sponsored by
UNESCO and China. The remainder will be donated to Normal
Universities at the Education Ministry level and the Provincial
level.
</P>
<P>
Wei Yu, vice-minister and chairperson of the Chinese National
Commission for UNESCO, declared that the ambitious "Education
Action Plan for the 21st Century" formulated recently by the
Chinese government, is designed to accelerate the reform and
development of science and education, thus revitalizing the
country.
</P>
<P>
She said that UNESCO was making its contribution to the
execution of the Plan through such cooperative and beneficial
projects like this.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that next time I visit those schools, I will see that
the encyclopaedias have been read frequently and are not just for
show," stressed Dr Ian Birch, education consultant from the Asian
Center of Education and Innovation for Development(ACEID) under
UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
Then he announced that today's gift was merely the start of an
ongoing project to distribute educational materials throughout
China.
</P>
<P>
"Already I am delighted to tell you that we have agreed to
allocate a further 300 sets of the encyclopaedia along with a
further 166,000 volumes of other reference books and textbooks
with a retail value of 8 million U.S. dollars." he said, adding
that they would be distributed around secondary school and
teaching institutions.

<HEADLINE> HK Stock Market to Remain Volatile: HKSE Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The high volatility in the
stock market will remain for some time next year, Alec Tsui, chief
executive of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, said here Tuesday
at a year-end review press conference.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Tsui briefed the media on the market
performance, the exchange's achievements in 1998 and plans for the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
As of November 26, 1998, the market value of shares of domestic
listed companies in Hong Kong dropped 18.4 percent compared with
that at the same period last year, Tsui said.
</P>
<P>
As of December 18, 1998, the bench-mark Hang Seng Index (HSI)
went down by 5 percent to 10,226 points from the 10,754 points on
December 18, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The market capitalization decreased 16 percent over the same
period last year. The total turnover and the average daily
turnover in the past 12 months ending December 18 slid by 55
percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong has achieved positive
results in re-organizing the exchange structure, drawing up the
listing rules and policy, strengthening members regulations,
tackling the year 2000 problem and reviewing the compensation
scheme, Tsui said.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward, Tsui said the exchange will make efforts to
restore the market's capital formation capability through raising
market quality, which includes improving market facilities,
strengthening market regulations, increasing market transparency
and improving market efficiency as well as strengthening investor
protection and education.
</P>
<P>
Tsui said the exchange will continue to increase its
competitive edge and is competing vigorously in the highly
competitive international exchange industry. He believes that Hong
Kong will maintain its position as a major international financial
center in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Assist Albania in Curbing Flow of Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Italy will continue to provide
Albania with economic and social assistance to help stop the flow
of refugees from entering Italy, said visiting Italian
Social and Family Affairs Minister Livia Turco on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Italy will not only continue to fund the previously agreed upon
cooperation programs between the two countries, but will also
advise Albania on how to formulate relevant laws and regulations,
Turco told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Italy will initiate 64 social cooperation programs worth 20
billion lira (12.7 million U.S. dollars) with Albania, which will
provide assistance to women, children, juveniles and try to reduce
poverty, she added.
</P>
<P>
During her stay here, Turco met with Albanian President Mexhep
Meidani and Prime Minister Pandeli Majko.
</P>
<P>
Meidani called on the two countries to make joint efforts to
help Albania shake off its economic problems and political
instability.
</P>
<P>
Majko attributed the flow of Albanian illegals across the
border to poverty in their own country. He called for the
earliest implementation of the bilateral cooperation programs. He
also noted that present police measures were not enough.
</P>
<P>
By estimate, about 100,000 Albanian refugees have illegally
entered Italy since 1991. About 51,000 were caught by Italian
police.

<P>
DHAKA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Five major rivers flowing
through Bangladesh's northern districts are changing their courses
in their land of origin in India, the Associated Press of
Bangladesh (APB) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is due to the commissioning of the Teesta Barrage in India
and unilateral withdrawal of waters, especially during the dry
season, an executive engineer of the Water Development Board was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rivers are Karotoa, Mahananda, Atrai, Teesta and Dharala
and all the rivers have been also losing their navigability, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Vast lands in the northern region of Bangladesh are facing
desertification as a result of the massive and unilateral
withdrawal of waters by India, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The level of ground water has also gone down because of this,
badly affecting irrigation in the northern region of the country,
he added.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in Clashes over Land in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- At least two men were
killed and more than 15 others wounded when armed clashes broke
out between the two sides in south Mogadishu Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, heavy gun fire exchanged between
militiamen from the Islamic court of Shirkole of south Mogadishu
and clan-motivated militiamen near the busy intersection of Bar
Ubah.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is not known officially. However,
the eyewitnesses in the area said the shooting began after a
serious dispute had erupted between a man driving a truck with 10
armed militiamen and another whom they had quarreled over the
ownership of a piece of land at Aymiska area of south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The man with the truck has tried to kidnap the other man
before the Islamic court militiamen of Shirkole intervened, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses said that three of the Islamic militiamen
were wounded during the early moments of the clash.
</P>
<P>
However, the Islamist forces have in the end managed to
control the situation and forcefully restored the security in the
area after the militiamen from the other side fled for their
lives, leaving behind one dead and two others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Islamic court said the case of the two
sides over the dispute of the land ownership will soon be revised
after the civil courts of the late regime could not handle the
long-standing dispute between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Lawmaker Urges Study of the Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng
today called for improving China's legal system by examining the
country's rich legal heritage stretching back thousands of years
which he insists has a lot to teach today's modern society.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, the country's highest legislature, made the remarks at
the sixth legal conference sponsored here today by the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China has yet to tap its rich lawmaking
heritage and its traditionally efficient, and admired legal
framework. "We should discard the dross and pick up the
essentials," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Li added that perhaps the country could also examine
the useful experience of foreign countries, although with maybe a
critical eye,
</P>
<P>
The chairman described the third plenary session of the 11th
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which was
convened 20 years ago, as a great watershed which helped bring an
end to the country's lawlessness during the " Cultural
Revolution". Li said that it had anchored China, enabling it to
build up a proper legal system.
</P>
<P>
Today's discussion and speech in Beijing are aimed at improving
the legal knowledge of the members of NPC Standing Committee and
to commemorate the 3rd plenum of the 11th Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jinfan, a professor with the China University of Law and
Political Science, also gave a lecture on China's legal tradition
attended by staff workers and officials of the NPC Standing
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Millions of Sudanese May Face Famine in 1999: UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- More than four million Sudanese
will continue to live under the threat of famine if peace and
security are not firmly established in the conflict-affected areas
throughout the country, a U.N. organization said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Many people are surviving on the bare minimum and that slim
hope could be shattered in the event their lives are once again
disrupted by turmoil, the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) said.
</P>
<P>
"Even a few weeks of insecurity, especially in Bahr el Ghazal,
could produce the kind of crisis we confronted earlier this year,"
said Philippe Borel, U.N. coordinator for relief operations in
Sudan. He is also head of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), which
has just published its 1998 Annual Needs Assessment.
</P>
<P>
"It takes years for people to recover once they get caught in a
vicious cycle of desperation such as this," said David Fletcher,
acting country director for Kenya for the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, who is also deputy coordinator of OLS, said that
hundreds of thousands of families who have lost their homes,
livestock and crops "are still living dangerously on the edge."
</P>
<P>
And that makes a cease-fire essential for averting famine in
1999, said Borel.
</P>
<P>
The OLS annual report cautioned that the situation in the Upper
Nile region, where local populations are still suffering from
interfactional fighting and flooding in 1998, could deteriorate if
insecurity continues to hamper relief efforts or large-scale
population displacement occurs.
</P>
<P>
By late 1998, the report said persistent insecurity, especially
around Leer, and flooding had displaced some 150,000 people,
forced OLS agencies to evacuate, and limited humanitarian services
to some locations.
</P>
<P>
In northern Sudan, the report warned, humanitarian needs could
increase in the Kassala region, where insecurity escalated in 1998
and may continue in 1999.

<HEADLINE> 6 Nigerian Officers Promoted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian military leader
General Abdulsalam Abubakar has promoted six officers from the
rank of major generals to that of lieutenant generals, or
three-star generals.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Xinhua here Tuesday, Defense spokesman Colonel
S.A. Tella said there is nothing special about the promotion,
adding that it is just fulfillment of vacancy.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement Monday from the office of the
Principal Staff Officer to Abubakar, the Chief of General Staff,
Rear Admiral Mike Akgihbe is now a Vice Admiral, while the Chief
of Defense Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Al-Amin Daggash is now an Air
Marshal.
</P>
<P>
The Chief of Army Staff, Major-General Ishaya Bamaiyi was
promoted to rank of Lieutenant General; the Chief of Naval Staff,
Rear Admiral Jubrila Ayinla to the rank of Vice Admiral.
</P>
<P>
Also affected in the promotion exercise are the Chief of Air
Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Nsikak Eduok and Major-General Rufus
Kupolati, Chairman of the Petroleum Trust Fund for the Armed
Forces and Police.
</P>
<P>
Before Abubakar took the office in June, Nigeria had only
three lieutenant generals, including former Chief of General
Staff, Oladipo Diya, Minister of the Federal Capital Territory,
Jeremiah Useni and Industry Minister Balarabe Haladu.
</P>
<P>
All the service chiefs then, including Abubakar himself, who
was the Chief Defense Staff, were at the rank of major generals.
</P>
<P>
Diya is serving a jail term for alleged involvement in a coup
plot against late head of state General Sani Abacha. Useni
retired from the army soon after Abubakar came to power, while
Haladu died in the mid-year.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar was promoted to the rank of general when he was
chosen by the military as the new leader, following the sudden
death of Abacha in June.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Indian-Russian Relations and Beyond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov winded up his two-day official visit to India
Tuesday in the context of the United States and British air
strikes against Iraq, which led to the urgent return to Moscow of
Russian foreign and defence ministers from their foreign trips.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Primakov refused to postpone the visit showed
Moscow's opposition to the strikes and sent a signal to Washington
that Russia is against a unipolar world in which the U.S. could
cast itself in the role of a global policeman.
</P>
<P>
"Delhi and Moscow share the concept of a multi-polar world and
the supremacy of the United Nations in resolving international
disputes and this is a good time for them to reiterate their
stand," a Russian foreign ministry source said last week.
</P>
<P>
Despite its very strong opposition to the eastward extension of
NATO, Moscow has avoided frontal confrontation with it by signing
the Russia-NATO Foundation Act on May 27, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that one reason for Primakov's visit to New
Delhi is to exhibit the special relationship between India and
Russia which is right in the midst of negotiations with western
countries for food for its scarcity-hit regions and cities.
</P>
<P>
The agreements signed on Monday between the two countries
included a broad-based defence pact, the Long-term Agreement on
Military-Technical Cooperation up to the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was based on the existing one that expires
on December 31, 2000, is expected to boost the slumping Russian
defence equipment manufactures.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is the first head of government of the five permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council to visit New Delhi
since India's nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
Russia jointed the international community to condemn the tests
but opposed from the very beginning to impose sanctions by the
United States and other countries on its traditional ally.
</P>
<P>
However, Primakov's request for India to sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which was reportedly raised during
his talks with Indian Minister for External Affairs Jaswant Singh,
was refused by the Indian side.
</P>
<P>
Singh told Primakov that his country might contemplate to join
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), "but we will never join
the NPT".

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said here Tuesday that the regional states should
protect their interest themselves in the region, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"If the regional countries stand together, there is no need
for the presence of foreigners," Khatami told visiting Omani
Minister of Commerce and Industry Maqbool Bin Ali Bin Sultan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recent U.S.-British strikes against Iraq was
a great tragedy for the Iraqi oppressed people and the Islamic
Republic of Iran which as chairman of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference has condemned this aggression.
</P>
<P>
"We have also asked Iraq to act in agreement with
international regulations and the Security Council resolutions, so
as not to give others any excuses since it's the people of Iraq
and the regional states who pay for it," the Iranian president
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran-Oman relations, Khatami said Oman's policy
has pursued cooperation among Muslim states in the region,
tranquility in the region and consolidation of the ties.
</P>
<P>
The Omani minister delivered a message from Sultan Qaboos of
Oman to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the active status of the Iran-Oman joint
economic commission and called for further expansion of ties

<HEADLINE> Philippine Officials Warned Against Accepting Gifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
warned officials Tuesday against accepting expensive Christmas
gifts, especially if they are apparently meant to influence
official decisions.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here by the presidential office, a
government spokesman said the law allows public servants to
receive only gifts of little monetary value as tokens of the
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
"There is still the law that we cannot receive gifts. The gifts
that can be accepted are only those worth little monetary value,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the law penalizes both the giver and the receiver, once
the graft-busting office finds them liable for giving and
accepting expensive gifts.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora also said
the law applies also to members of the congress, and he cautioned
them to be wary of what the public may perceive about their
receiving such gifts.
</P>
<P>
"I think congressmen should be very careful about the
perceptions of people. There is a law, the ethical standards law,
so they have to be a little careful about these things," Zamora
said.

<P>
NAIROBI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The East African Investment
Ltd., a venture run jointly by China Enterprises Network (CEN)
and the Beijing-based Dahua Electronics Company, has recently
been registered in Nairobi, Xinhua learned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new venture, with its office building along the Ngong Road
in Kenya's capital, plans to build a two-square-kilometer
processing development zone in Nairobi to facilitating Chinese
companies which intend to explore their business in this east
African country, Hou Long, the company's representative, told
Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
After completion, Hou said, the development zone will be able
to host 30 to 50 Chinese companies for producing and marketing
their products in the zone.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not give the amount of investment required for
the opening up of the development zone.
</P>
<P>
Hou said that the Dahua Electronics and CEN have decided to
set up a computer factory in the zone. With an investment of 20
million U.S. Dollars in the next two years, the factory will have
an annual production capacity of 50,000 computers.
</P>
<P>
Of the factory's production, Hou said, 20 percent of the
products are targeted for local market and the rest will go to
other countries in east and southern Africa including Tanzania
and Uganda.

TEHRAN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Iraqi stopped the

1980-88 war following the U.S.-British strikes against Iraq, an
Iranian official announced on Tuesday.
</P>

He noted that the search operation would resume after the
return of normal conditions, final cessation of the U.S.-British
attacks on Iraq and announcement of Iraq's readiness.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Anglo-American Corporation
(AAC) and Zambia have signed a non-legally binding memorandum of
understanding over the sale of Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola mines,
AAC said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Tuesday quoted an AAC spokesman as saying
that The memorandum will only become effective when the two sides
sign it.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that at this stage AAC is concerned with
depressed metal prices and the firm may not meet the immediate
cash requirements of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage the board of the Zambia Copper Investment
(ZCI), the company through which AAC holds shares to safeguard
its interest in ZCCM (Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines), has
concerns in regard to the immediate financial commitment which
would be expected of ZCI at a time when metal prices continue to
decline and ZCI has not been able to attract new partners. In
consequence the board of ZCI has not ratified the memorandum
yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said negotiations on several important issues
are continuing.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that some of Zambia's major donors
will soon start making arrangements to disburse balance of
payment support pledged earlier this year in view of the sale of
the three mines.
</P>
<P>
The mines have been sold to ACC at the price of 72 million
U.S. Dollars and the new owner are expected to take them over by
the end of March of next year, Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi
said last week.
</P>
<P>
In may this year donors pledged to give Zambia an aid of 530
million Dollars. However, they have withheld the money to
pressure it to speed up the privatization of the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
Due to disagreement over the cost of Nkana and Nchanga mines,
Zambia discontinued the negotiations with Kafue Consortium last
April over the sale of the two biggest mines in the country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that originally Zambia demanded Kafue
pay 400 million Dollars for the two mines.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Preparations for Macao SAR Well Under Way (Part 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Since its founding on May 5 this
year, the Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) has been operating well to work out a series of decisions
on establishing the future SAR.
</P>
<P>
Being a subordinate organ under China's National People's Congress,
the Preparatory Committee mainly takes charge of mapping out the
methods on forming the first administrative, legislative and judicial
bodies of the Macao SAR. And it has to handle various legal, economic,
social and cultural affairs concerning the handover.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Preparatory Committee will organize a 200-member
election committee consisting of only Macao residents who will elect
the first chief executive of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
With conscientious, responsible and pragmatic spirit, the 100
members of the committee, 60 of whom are Macao residents, have been
collecting the opinons and suggestions of local people on
constructing the SAR.
</P>
<P>
From September 3 to 6, the Preparatory Committee held 13
consultation meetings in Macao to solicit the opinions of local people
on forming the election committee. A total of 324 organizations of
varied walks of life and nearly 1,000 persons took part in the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
With enthusiastic participation, Macao residents voiced their views
on the principles reigning over the election committee, qualifications
of the committee members and the procedures to set up the committee.

<HEADLINE> Preparations for Macao SAR Well Under Way (Part 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Based on the consultations, the Fourth Plenary Session of the
Preparatory Committee in early November passed the method on forming
the election committee.
</P>
<P>
The method stipulates that any Macao permanent resident over 18-
years-old can apply to join the election committee provided that they
support the "one country, two systems" concept and the Macao Basic
Law. The number of candidates for election committee will be 30
percent more than the actual figure of committee members.
</P>
<P>
What's important, the method makes it clear that the procedures to
turn out the election committee must follow the principle of equity,
justness, transparancy, democracy and honesty in response to the
expectation of Macao residents.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, election committee members are supposed not to accept
bribes, influence the stance of other members or utter remarks of
personal attack.
</P>
<P>
The election of the chief executive of the Macao SAR indicates that
Macao residents, who have been under colonial rule for more than 400
years with the governor appointed from Portugal, will be ushered in a
new period featuring democratic participation in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the method on forming the election committee, the
Preparatory Committee has made a series of significant decisions in
its four plenary sessions from May to November.
</P>
<P>
The decision that China's central government will station troops in
the Macao SAR has been hailed by the masses of Macao residents who
think that the troops will play a frightening role for containing gang
crimes in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen, chairman of the Preparatory Committee, explained that
the stationing of troops symbolizes China's sovereignty over Macao,
the troops will take charge of only defense affairs and the central
government will pay relevant military expenses.
</P>
<P>
To localize civil servants has been a major issue in the
transitional period, for most senior employees of the Macao government
used to be Portuguese. But up to now, local Chinese still make up only
a small part of government department directors, the highest rank of
civil service in Macao.

<P>
In this sense, the Preparatory Committee has vehemently urged
the Portuguese Macao government to quicken the pace of localizing
civil servants and raising their competence.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Macao's public security, the Preparatory Committee
has made a decision requiring that the Macao government shoulder full
responsibility for improving public security and step up the crackdown
upon criminal activities so as to ensure steady handover.
</P>
<P>
Considering that the SAR government will be established on December
20 of 1999, the Preparatory Committee has decided that the Portuguese
side should cooperate with the Chinese side in mapping out the fiscal
budget for the year 2000 so that economic and fiscal policies after
the handover can be implemented well.
</P>
<P>
With hundreds of years of Portuguese rule, there are a large
number of Macao-born Portuguese in Macao. Now that China defies
double nationality, the Preparatory Committee decides that
Macao-born Portuguese can opt for Chinese or Portuguese
nationalities. They can remain residents of the SAR before they
make a choice.
</P>
<P>
To make the future SAR government more clean, the Preparatory
Committee has decided in its third plenary session that
anti-corruption and auditing organs and an independent customs should
be established.
</P>
<P>
In terms of pension fund for retired civil servants of the
Portuguese Macao government, the Preparatory Committee has called for
the Macao government to cease transferring more pension fund to
Portugal before a consensus is reached in the Sino-Portuguse Joint
Liaison Group.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Preparatory Committee has made resolutions on the
issuance of stamps during the transitional period and after the
handover, and on holiday arrangements in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Next year, the Preparatory Committee is expected to hold
another five plenary sessions on some key issues. The most
important one is to work out the method on electing the first
chief executive. The method may be approved at the fifth plenum in
January.
</P>
<P>
With reference to the practice in establishing the Hong Kong SAR,
the first chief executive of the Macao SAR should be elected half year
before the handover, which means the end of May or early June.
</P>
<P>
Other major works of the Preparatory Committee include further
research on the administrative framework of the SAR, the checking on
current laws in Macao, the transfer of assets of the Portuguese Macao
government and celebrating activities around the handover.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Expresses Confidence on Winning Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 22 (Xinhua) -- One day after the Israeli
Knesset (Parliament) passed the first reading of a bill for early
elections, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that
the public would back his peace policy with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Netanyahu said that "we
will go to the people and the people will give us the support to
achieve peace with security."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also brushed aside a public opinion poll published
on local daily Yediot Aharonot, which suggested that Netanyahu
would be defeated if he competed now with his two major political
rivals separately in general elections.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister predicted that he would draw massive
support from voters who are affiliated with his Likud party.
</P>
<P>
However, Dan Meridor, former finance minister of Netanyahu's
government, announced on Tuesday that he was quitting the Likud
party and entering the race for prime minister himself.
</P>
<P>
Following Monday's vote in the Knesset, Meridor was the first
Likud member to challenge Netanyahu. And this move will weaken
Netanyahu's strength in the elections.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Netanyahu also reiterated the conditions
to further implement the land-for-peace agreement with the
Palestinians singed in October.
</P>
<P>
He said that the turmoil caused by the pending early elections
have no influence on the fulfillment of the accord.
</P>
<P>
And a statement issued by Netanyahu's office also said on
Tuesday that "Israel will carry out its part in the agreement,
without any relation to the election schedule."
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian National Authority has rejected the
additional conditions and called on Israel to honor the signed
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The early elections bill must pass two more readings in the
Knesset. But since Netanyahu has said he will not try to block
its passage, the bill will pass finally and early elections are
expected to be held next April.

<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- On Thursday, China will issue
1.6 billion yuan worth of corporate bonds to finance the country's
railway projects.
</P>
<P>
With an annual interest rate of 6.95 percent, the bonds will
mature in 2003. The China Securities Co. Ltd. will be the major
underwriter for the bond issue, which has been granted a AAA
rating.
</P>
<P>
Funds raised through the bond issue will be used for the
country's key railway projects, whose total investment exceeds 20
billion yuan, and will all be completed before 2000, said
officials with the Ministry of Railways, issuer of the bonds.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, China has raised nearly ten billion yuan by issuing
corporate bonds. This issue is the second this year, the first
having raised 2.1 billion yuan in the first half.
</P>
<P>
A ranking official with the Ministry of Railways said the
ministry is planning more bond issues because a total of 250
billion yuan will be needed for railway construction in the next
five years.

<HEADLINE> HIV/Aids Patients Can Study in S. African Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Pupils and students with
HIV/ Aids may not be prevented from going to university and
school, nor may a teacher be dismissed if he or she contracts the
disease, the South African Education Department said.
</P>
<P>
The Star daily Tuesday quoted a draft policy of the department
published in the latest Government Gazette as saying that there
was an "insignificant risk" of transmission in schools and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
"There are no known cases of HIV transmission in schools or
higher education institutions," it stated.
</P>
<P>
Testing for HIV/Aids is prohibited, and the disease sufferers
may not be compelled to disclose if they have the illness to
authorities. However, "voluntary disclosure should be welcomed,"
the document said.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of the new policy, which has been welcomed in
KwaZulu Natal Province where infection rates are estimated to be
more than 30 percent, is to prevent discrimination against Aids
sufferers, to increase awareness of the disease and to prevent
its spread.
</P>
<P>
"Learners and students with HIV/Aids should lead as full a
life as possible and should not be denied the opportunity to
receive an education," the policy document said.
</P>
<P>
According to the South African Education Department,
scientific evidence suggests that the risk of HIV transmission
during teaching, sports and play activities is insignificant if
ordinary hygiene precautions are adhered to.
</P>
<P>
These precautions include the training of teacher, pupils and
students on how to cope should a situation arise where there is a
risk of transmission.
</P>
<P>
In contact sports, such as rugby, proper wound management in
the case of bleeding should prevent transmission.
</P>
<P>
South Africa makes Aids education compulsory and says that a
continuing HIV/Aids education program must be implemented at all
schools and institutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The disappointing
diamond sales by South Africa's diamond giant De Beers in 1998
have pointed to a difficult financial year ahead for neighboring
Botswana, local daily The Citizen reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
De Beers sold raw diamond for 4.64 billion U.S. dollars in
1998, down 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Botswna's economy is closely related to its diamond
production. It is the world's largest producer of diamonds by
value and accounts for 33.5 percent of diamonds sold to the
Central Selling Organization (CSO) of De Beers.
</P>
<P>
Botswana's diamond industry is inextricably tied to the CSO.
The country's sales of diamond are all through the CSO. The
stones are mined by Debswana which is a 50 to 50 partnership
between De Beers and the Botswana government.
</P>
<P>
The CSO sales were the lowest for 10 years and lower than
those of the two toughest years for Botswana during the that
period, 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
Botswana's sales to the CSO in the first half of 1998 were
15.6 percent down on 1997 in U.S. Dollar terms, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Beijing police have recently
exposed a foreign exchange fraud case involving 130 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in the Chinese capital said the Renfu New
Technology Development Center, a Beijing-based foreign trade
company, had used 284 fake customs documents to buy 130 million US
dollars from banks since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
It sold the hard currencies to some Chinese companies which
requested that the money be remitted directly to their bank
accounts abroad. The deal enabled the center to earn 12 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Such cheating on the foreign exchange, resulting in capital
outflow, constitutes a major crime in China as the country imposes
control over capital accounts.
</P>
<P>
Police have arrested eight people including two bank clerks who
assisted in the fraud, sources said.

Ephraim Akpata in Nigerian capital Abuja to chairmen of the
People's Democratic Party, (PDP), the All People's Party (APP)
and the Alliance for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
The final registration of the three parties were announced by
INEC last Monday, which will enable the parties to participate in
remaining elections under the military government's transition to
civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
The INEC had earlier approved the provisional registration of
nine parties, but it ruled that only those that scored five
percent of the total votes cast in each of at least 24 states out
of a total of 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)
in the local elections would be given formal registration.
</P>
<P>
According to INEC figures, the PDP won five percent and above
of the total votes in 36 states and FCT with 459 chairmanship
positions and 4,650 councillorship seats in the December 5 local
elections.
</P>
<P>
The APP scored five percent votes and above in 36 states
including FCT with 188 chairmanship position and 2,589
councillorship seats.
</P>
<P>
AD scored five percent and above of total votes cast in 14
states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and won 100
chairmanship positions and 1,071 councillorship seats, but INEC
rules allow it to be registered as the party that is nearest to
the standard out of the remaining seven parties that failed the
standard.
</P>
<P>
According to the transition timetable, Nigeria would hold the
state governors and legislators elections in January and the
presidential election in February, while the civilian president
would be sworn in in May 1999.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ambassador to Return to U.S. Wednesday </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador to the
United States Yuri Vorontsov, who was recalled for consultations
in protest against U.S. airstrikes on Iraq, will return to
Washington Wednesday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the consultations became necessary due to
the strikes "which, the Russian leadership believes, have created a
rather serious situation complicating the work of the United
Nations, including in the sphere of the nonproliferation of
nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military action has also affected Russian-U.S.
cooperation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The complication of Russian-U.S. relations was not our
choice," he said. "Russia has stood and is standing for consistent
development of relations between Moscow and Washington, which
conforms to the interests of our countries and international
stability."
</P>
<P>
"Much will depend on U.S. policy and on whether the United
States is going to take favorable steps," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also announced that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright would visit Moscow in the second half of next
January.
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow hopes that Albright's visit would help overcome
"the negative consequences of the U.S. use of force against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Now that the United States has stopped using force against Iraq
which Russia insists on, the process of settling the Iraq crisis
by political means should be restored fully and the key part of
the U.N. Security Council in this process should be reinstated, he
said
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the spokesman said that consultations
with the Russian Ambassador to Britain Yuri Fokin was continuing
and that Fokin would return to London after the consultations.

<HEADLINE> China's Machinery and Manufacturing Sector on a Roll in 1999: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) --China's manufacturing and
machinery industry has picked up since the third quarter of this
year with official statistics showing an increase of 3.8 percent
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
This is actually 1.7 percentage points higher than the growth
level in the first eight months of this year and experts predict
it will continue its upward momentum in 1999.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that demand for building materials will become
a hot spot as the real estate market continues its boom and China
will increase even further the investment in infrastructure
construction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, timber imports will further increase in 1999 since
the Chinese Government decided to stop logging in natural forests
this year, resulting in a drop in the domestic timber output.
</P>
<P>
And there will still be a domestic oversupply of finished steel
which has also been hit by cheaper imports from Russia and the
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
However, economic analysts agree that it will be necessary to
control the import volume and crack down on smuggling to stimulate
domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> HK Trade Development Council Plans Budget to Boost Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Trade Development
Council (TDC) has planned a one-billion-HK-dollar (128.2 million
U.S. dollars) budget to help Hong Kong companies market their
products and services worldwide next year, the Council's Executive
Director Michael Sze announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite heavy cuts to its income from trade declaration charges
due to rate reduction and trade downturn, the TDC is determined to
provide more promotional opportunities and better services to
business. "In the tough times, it is particularly necessary for
TDC to do more to help Hong Kong companies, especially small and
medium-sized enterprises, compete in overseas markets," Sze said
at a year-ending briefing.
</P>
<P>
TDC is now going through a vigorous exercise to examine ways to
cut internal costs, increase the value of every dollar spent on
promotion and to add more value to the programs and services
provided. Among various measures to take is that TDC executives
eligible for traveling on business class flights will now switch
to economic class, except for inter-continental business trips.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will face a tough challenge concerning trade in the
coming year, the TDC predicted. Hong Kong's merchandise exports
are forecast to contract again next year, but more modestly. Total
exports are likely to drop five percent, with domestic exports
likely falling by seven percent and re-exports by five percent.
These estimated figures for the whole of this year are minus eight
percent, minus 11 percent and minus eight percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Imports, which are linked to re-export performance and domestic
demand, are forecast to fall by five percent, against the 1998
figure of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
But Hong Kong's service exports, by contrast, are expected to
register a modest gain next year, against a very low base this
year.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for Hong Kong's exports will continue to be
overshadowed by the Asian financial turmoil. There are signs of
improving macroeconomic fundamentals in the region. But the
lingering effects of the economic crisis are unlikely to subside
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The global economic growth is going to slow down and both
China's mainland and Hong Kong SAR are to face greater challenges
next year, Edward Leung, TDC's Chief Economist predicted. "But
the situation will improve in 2000," he said at the briefing on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With more productivity being switched to China's mainland, Hong
Kong's GDP is expected to drop while GNP is to improve, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, will further emancipate the mind and
open wider to the outside world, Mayor Lin Shusen said today.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a meeting citing Guangzhou's outstanding
achievements in overseas-financed enterprises, Lin said his city
will increase the number of industries making use of overseas
investment, and advance the opening up of the service trades.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts should be made to attract more overseas funds
to the city's high-tech sector, said the mayor, while urging that
more attention be paid to fighting hidden risks from foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
The mayor also pledged to try all possible means to increase
exports, go all out to improve the investment environment in
Guangzhou, and increase economic and technological cooperation
between Guangzhou and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A total of 59 overseas-backed enterprises were cited at today's
meeting for good performances in both investment and export,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou now has 8,544 overseas-financed enterprises. By
November this year, the actual paid-in volume of overseas
investment into the city had hit 16.61 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, overseas-backed enterprises accounted for about 42
percent of Guangzhou's total industrial output value, shipped 60.7
percent of the city's total exports, and generated 30 percent of
the city's gross tax revenues, sources said.

<P>
MANILA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in the
Philippines increased to 9.6 percent in October from 7.9 percent a
year ago, the National Statistics Office said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Labor force (in October this year) was 1.013 million more than
in October 1997, with 374,000 finding work bringing the number of
unemployed to 639,000 and the unemployment rate to 9.6 percent,"
the office said in a labor force survey.
</P>
<P>
However, the office said, October's unemployment rate dropped
from 13.3 percent in April, the highest in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The office also said employment in service in October gained
4.8 percent over that of October 1997 while that in agriculture
was slightly over the level a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Employment in industry declined by 4.7 percent in the month
from that of a year ago, it added.
</P>
<P>
Economists here blamed the on-going financial crisis for the
high unemployment rate in the country, where many companies closed
or have cut their staff since the crisis started 18 months ago.

<P>
COLOMBO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police have
arrested the leader of the Colombo intelligence wing of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), an evening newspaper here
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Observer quoted police as saying the suspect, identified as
Yogeswaran Nixon, has been known in the LTTE circles by the code
name of Sandran.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have revealed that Sandran had been planning
massive destruction in Colombo, the country's capital, a senior
security official said.
</P>
<P>
On interrogation Sandran had confessed that he was the leader
of the LTTE's Colombo finance and intelligence division. He came
to Colombo from Jaffna in 1990 and was living with his parents in
the city, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Police said Sandran had been an active member in the LTTE's
Colombo activities since arriving in the capital, working on
instructions from the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
It has also been found that the suspect had been responsible
for providing bombs, suicide kits, money and cyanide capsules to
other LTTE cadres who came to Colombo on killing and destruction
missions, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sandran joined the LTTE in 1988 and had received special
training in handling artillery, the reports added.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been waging a war against the government
since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic Council of Asia
(OCA) is in medal quandary after two more athletes tested
positive during the Asian Games, officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Two United Arab Emirates (UAE) athletes including Fakruddin
Taher, who won the silver in the 60-kilogramme kumite karate,
have been disqualified after failing drug tests.
</P>
<P>
Taher and unplaced 400-meter hurdler Abdulla Sabt tested
positive for the banned stimulant ephedrine on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
OCA Secretary General Randhir Singh told AFP that Taher had
been stripped of his medal, but it was unclear who would be the
new silver medallist as the karate event awarded two bronzes to
the losers of the semi-finals instead of holding a third-place
playoff.
</P>
<P>
"We have to decide on how to allocate the medal. The sports
committee of the OCA will be handling it," Randhir Singh was
quoted as saying. "We are going to have to give joint medals,
because they can't give a single one now."
</P>
<P>
He said the two bronze medallists would likely receive the
silver, while the bronzes would go to the next runners up.

PARIS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While life in Baghdad has returned to normal, the Iraqi
press is imposing a black-out on the loss from U.S.-British
bombings last week. No report on the four days of bombing has ever
appeared in Iraqi newspapers or on Iraqi television which
dedicated most of their programs to praising President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
-- French combat aircraft participated in the reconnaissance
missions over Iraq before the launching of "Desert Fox"
operation. The photos of electronic reconnaissance taken by French
planes were transmitted to the U.S. Air Force which used them for
establishing targets for strikes. France has not officially
admitted the "indirect participation" in the "Desert Fox"
operation.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time in the history of the 55-member
pan-European organization, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is deploying 2,000 unarmed observers
in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. Their deployment is expected
to complete on January 1.
</P>
<P>
-- After being subjected to four days of strikes, life is
returning to normal in the Iraqi capital Baghdad and the 106
U.N. personnel in charge of implementing the "Oil for Food"
program are due to return to Iraq on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Iraq has
presented two pre-conditions for resuming cooperation with the
U.N. over disarmament -- condemning U.S.-British aggression and
the lifting of sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippines Response to Crisis Keeps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
indicated Tuesday that it has worked out its way to keep the
economy resilient amid the Asian economic crisis and to prepare it
for further consolidation and recovery next year.
</P>
<P>
"Our policy response worked well as 1998 proved the resilience
of the Philippine economy," the government said in its Year-End
Report on the Economy.
</P>
<P>
Emerging as one of the first positive-sign-showing Asian
countries, the Philippines has taken pains to cushion the economic
contagion's effects, including currency depreciation, financial
turmoil and economic slowdown or recession and tried to turn
around these things.
</P>
<P>
After more than one year, the measures taken to alleviate these
effects turned out to be the major contributors to the economic
resilience, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
On January 7, 1998, the Philippine currency peso reached its
trough of 45.40 pesos against the U.S. dollar, representing a
depreciation of about 41.9 percent from the pre-crisis level of
26.4 pesos.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the Philippine Central Bank offered
the currency risk protection program to provide corporate
borrowers an instrument to hedge their foreign currency
obligations to foreign currency deposit units.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the peso has gradually stabilized and hit its
strongest performance of 38-39 pesos against the dollar in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
This protection program, combined with other regional and
domestic factors, resulted in the appreciation of the peso, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The next step was taken on the country's financial system.
</P>
<P>
One of the major differences between the Philippines and other
Asian countries is that the country has not had a financial crisis
and its financial system has remained inherently strong.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, reforms were continued to improve the transparency in
the banking system after the Asian crisis began, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Although the ratio of non-performing loans of the country's
banks to the total loan portfolio rose to 11.05 percent in August
this year, from 5.41 percent at the end of 1997, it was still
manageable.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the International Monetary Fund projected that
the ratio for Thailand, Indonesia and South Koran could rise to
25-40 percent, 30-40 percent, and 25-30 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to spur the economy, the Philippines has opted to
expand its deficit and expenditure to boost investment and
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 fiscal target was revised down from a surplus of 125
million U.S. dollars to a deficit of 1.2 billion dollars for the
whole 1998, the year-end report said. As of November, the deficit
stood at 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Philippine government has remained committed
to market-oriented policies and rejected the proposal to impose a
10-percent across-the-board tariff as well as a 50-percent
marginal deposit on letters of credit.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the gross national product (GNP) of the
Philippines is estimated to grow by about 0.5 percent to 1.0
percent this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
For 1999, the GNP is targeted to grow by 3.0 percent to 3.5
percent while gross domestic product is projected to grow by 2.6
percent to 3.1 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, as the measures are working to stabilize and
pump-prime the economy, the country has to weigh the balance
between these measures' short-run effects and the economy's
long-run objectives, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
That implies while all these measures keep the country from
slipping into a recession, they should not undermine the country's
long-run competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
After the test of the economy's resilience, this poses another
challenge to the country on its way to recovery.

BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) has revoked the trade
permits of three companies responsible for exchange infractions, a

MOFTEC said this was the most severe administrative punishment
ever adopted by the ministry.
</P>
<P>

to prevent exchange infractions.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC warned enterprises with import and export rights to draw
a lesson from this incident and avoid illegal dealings in foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that if enterprises are verified to be
involved in smuggling or exchange infractions, MOFTEC will issue
warnings or revoke their trade permits.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian International
Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said Tuesday that despite
the economic turmoil, investment interest has remained high in the
country's automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
Between January and October this year, her ministry approved 34
projects worth 655.8 million ringgit (about 172.578 million U.S.
dollars) in the field against 35 projects approved in 1997 worth
158.6 million ringgit (about 41.736 million dollars), Rafidah said
at a signing ceremony between Malaysia's Auto Trade (M) Sdn Bhd
and Indian-based vehicle manufacturer, Mahindra &AMP; Mahindra Ltd
here.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said that of the total 34 projects approved this year,
18 were new ones worth 595.4 million ringgit (about 156.684
million dollars) and 16 projects for expansion and diversification
worth 60.4 million ringgit (about 15.894 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The automotive industry has opened up opportunity for the
establishment and development of supportive sector, she said,
adding that so far there are 6,000 items already produced in
Malaysia, and it involved parts, components and accessories which
are related with the automotive trade.
</P>
<P>
She said the enhancement of the production parts and components
reflected the increased usage of local contents in the assembly
and manufacture of motor vehicles in which gross local content
currently stood at between 45 percent and 80 percent while net
local content is between 40 percent and 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
She said export performance of the automotive industry for both
motor vehicles and parts and accessories had been on the upward
trend with exports in 1996 totaling 948.5 million ringgit (about
249.605 million dollars), in 1997, totaling 1.075 billion ringgit
(about 282.894 million dollars) and 1.3316 billion ringgit (about
350.421 million dollars) between January and October this year.

cooperate with developing nations by providing funds, the former
should also further open their commodity and technology markets to
the latter in order to enhance competitiveness and the capacity to
avoid crisis, Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice president also said it is imperative to
strengthen inspection of the floating of short-term capital, and
establish dialogue within the mechanism of the East Asia informal
summit between vice ministers of finance and vice presidents of
central banks of the region's countries.
</P>
<P>
Hu also suggested setting up expert groups to study methods of
controlling floating capital.
</P>
<P>
Hu's proposals were welcomed and received positive responses at
the summit, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu added that during the meetings between Hu and leaders of
the ASEAN countries, the two sides reviewed progress in bilateral
relations since their first bilateral summit meeting in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that they will properly handle their
differences through comprehensive and cooperative mechanisms, and
adhere to the principle of equal and friendly consultation to push
forward the development of good-neighborly partnerships, Zhu
noted.

<HEADLINE> China Tries Criminals in Accordance with Law: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese judicial departments
have full independence to try criminals, and all talk to the
contrary is unacceptable, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao said here today at his regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks in response to questions about the recent
trials of three criminals who were sentenced for subversion of
state power in Chinese courts.
</P>
<P>
Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin were found guilty of
subverting state power and were sentenced to 13, 12, and 11 years
in prison respectively, today and yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, it was confirmed in the Chinese courts that
Xu and other criminals contacted hostile overseas organizations
and accepted overseas financial assistance to engage in activities
to subvert state power and jeopardize state security.
</P>
<P>
Zhu indicated that their activities were in violation of
relevant provisions of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic
of China.
</P>
<P>
China's public security and judicial departments arrested and
tried Xu and others in accordance with Chinese law, "a normal case
in a country with the rule of law," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the trial and punishment of criminals in
accordance with law are themselves judicial activities, and
"purely an internal matter of a sovereign state."
</P>
<P>
Zhu mentioned that China has noticed "some comments" from some
Western countries on the issue, saying that they are
"irresponsible and unreasonable."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's GDP Growth Increases by 6 Pct This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has realized its
National Assembly's adjusted target of a 6-percent GDP growth
despite flooding, drought and the regional economic crisis, The
Saigon Times Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's industrial growth has been maintained at 12 percent
with state enterprises achieving a growth of 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The volume of major industrial products has increased
considerably, including crude oil (22.9 percent), cement (79.4
percent), steel (16 percent), motorcycle assembly (14 percent),
soap (28.6 percent), cardboard (21.7 percent) and beer (16.3
percent).
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's power generation has grown 13.9 percent, electric fan
production 68.8 percent, bicycles 40.5 percent, molasses, 18.8
percent, silk 12.4 percent and beer 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drought and floods, Vietnam's agricultural
production has grown. The output of food (converted to paddy) has
reached 31.8 million tons, up more than one million tons from
1997. The agriculture, forestry and fishery sectors have achieved
an average growth of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The trading and service sectors have reported stable growth.
Total retail sales in 1998 are posted at 180,500 billion
Vietnamese Dong (about 13 billion U.S. dollars), a 14.2 percent
rise from last year.
</P>
<P>
However, "the Saigon times daily" said, the economic downturn,
low efficiency of business and production, falling demand, slow
economic restructuring, weaknesses in the banking and financial
system, and lavish spending have taken their toll.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the gap between rich and poor has widened and many
people in remote and flood-prone areas still lead difficult lives.

<HEADLINE> Changed Course of British Hot Balloon "Unacceptable": FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China regrets that the British
balloon Challenge has violated the agreement reached between China
and Britain for its flight over Chinese air space.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made this remark
at today's regular news briefing in response to questions on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, "China has decided to disapprove the entry of
the balloon into Chinese air space after taking into consideration
the safety of the hot balloon and civil aviation."
</P>
<P>
Zhu indicated that on November 17, the British embassy in China
issued a written guarantee in which it said that the balloon will
fly along an agreed course over China.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side will not take responsibility for the outcome
of such an act in violation of the agreement," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that China takes "an active attitude" for hot-balloon
activities and has approved the entry of three British-registered
hot balloons, including Challenge, into China's territorial
space. "However, it is international practice to require that such
activities be carried out under related regulations," he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the specific position of the balloon, so I can
only tell you about developments in the matter later, via
convenient channels," he said.

<HEADLINE> West Asian Countries' Economic Growth Down in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The average economic growth
rates for 13 Western Asian countries in 1998 will drop to 0.85
percent compared with 3 percent in 1997, a United Nations report
said.
</P>
<P>
The report was released on Monday by the Beirut-based
U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), the
Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the low growth rates in the region mainly
to the sharp decline in oil prices and revenues in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices slumped 33.4 percent between 1997 and 1998, falling
from 18.68 U.S. dollars to 12.44 dollars a barrel on average,
while oil demand declined by 400,000 to 500,000 barrels per day in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
Thus, oil revenues in the region are down from 95 billion
dollars in 1997 to 68 billion dollars in 1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also pointed to other factors likely to affect the
economic growth in the region, such as uncertainties over the
Middle East peace process and developments in the U.N. sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The report forecast an improvement in economic growth rate
estimated at 2.94 percent in 1999, taking into consideration
changes in oil prices in the coming year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy Plunges Into Recession in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economy, described
as one of the "tiger economies" before 1997, has plunged into
serious recession in 1998 following a prolonged monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
After hitting by the worst monetary crisis since July last
year, the value of the Indonesian rupiah has lost 60 percent
against the U.S. dollar. This year, government officials said,
Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to contract
around 14 percent compared with a positive growth of 6 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the inflation rate has also increased to 80 percent
in 1998, about ten times higher than that of last year. As a
result, the people's living standard in the country has decreased
sharply with per capital GDP now stands at around 400 U.S.
dollars, down from a pre-crisis level of over 1,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Because of the close-down of many enterprises and banks, the
country's unemployment has risen substantially. Current estimates
put the number at 13 million. Underemployment is estimated at some
37 percent of about 90 million people in the labor force. More
than 70 million people out of a population of 202 million have
fallen below the poverty line. Some 30 million of them will
experience absolute poverty by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The deepening of the economic crisis has also led to a grave
political crisis which forced Soeharto who had ruled the country
for 32 years to step down from presidency.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to arrest the country's economic crisis, the
Indonesian government under the leadership of President B.J.
Habibie has taken some important measures, such as stabilizing the
exchange rate of rupiah, shifting the development priority from
heavy industry to small and medium-sized enterprises as well as
cooperatives which could absorb a huge labor force.
</P>
<P>
In a move to speed up the national economic recovery program,
Bank Indonesia has decided to extend liquidity credits totaling
10.8 trillion (1.46 billion U.S. dollars) to small-scale
businesses and cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
To revitalize the ailing banking sector, the Indonesian
government has begun recapitalizing 70 out of 166 national
commercial banks at a cost of 257.5 trillion rupiah (34.3 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Realizing the relative strength of the agricultural sector in
the economic crisis, the government had also decided to give
priority to the development of the sector.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government has making efforts to seek
assistance from international monetary bodies including the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank as well as some countries.
</P>
<P>
Most of analysts predicted that Indonesia's economic growth in
1999 will still be negative between 6 percent to 8 percent. They
said the economic recovery will largely depend on the political
stability in the country where a general election will be held in
June next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Eight years ago, when Zhu
Rongji was mayor, the Pudong New Area was just a place for shabby
dwellings, narrow dirt paths, and patches of farmland.
</P>
<P>
But, the past eight years have turned it into a treasure trove
for Shanghai and it now generates more than 70 billion yuan (8.45
billion US dollars) in GDP, in sharp contrast to the 6 billion
yuan (725 million US dollars) in 1990.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, it had approved 5,430 overseas-financed
enterprises, with contracts of 10.46 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone on the Pujiang River's east
bank, is an example of the development. The 1.7-sq.km. zone was
built with a carefully-drafted plan.
</P>
<P>
A miniature of the design and a memento of the Pudong New Area
development office were recently added to the Museum of the
Chinese Revolution collection in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lujiazui now has 180 high-rise buildings, including the
88-storey Jinmao Mansion, China's tallest. Its businesses are in
banking, securities, insurance, trusts, and investments and fill
24 of the high-rises. The Shanghai Securities Building, the
biggest transaction hall in Asia, is also in the zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain called for a
complete review of the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq at its weekly
cabinet session this week, the UAE's Gulf News daily reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting chaired by Crown Prince and Acting Prime
Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa, "calls for a complete
review of sanctions, to ease the difficulties that these
sanctions have caused to the Iraqi people," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet welcomed the halting of military strikes against
Iraq by the U.S. and Britain, stressing the need to seize the
opportunity to contain the crisis by seeking a diplomatic
solution.
</P>
<P>
"The need of the hour is a permanent solution within the
framework of international laws, and not the military option with
all its negative effects," said Mohammed Al-Muttawa, the Cabinet
Affairs and Information Minister.
</P>
<P>
"Such a solution should guarantee the application of the
Security Council resolutions and also offer an entire review of
the sanctions imposed on Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Bahrain also urged Iraq to cooperate with the
U.N. Security Council in implementing all the relevant
U.N. resolutions to alleviate and avoid further sufferings of the
Iraqi people.

LUSAKA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has dropped its treason
charges against Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) President Dean
Mung'omba and Nakatindi Wina, a former senior official of the
ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), government-owned
Zambia Daily Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka High Court judge Japhet Banda Monday discharged them on
nolle prosequi six days after the duo were granted constitutional
bail by the same court.
</P>
<P>
In response to the state's entering of the nolle prosequi,
Banda said the state from the outset had no evidence against the
duo and had wrongfully set the criminal machinery against them,
indicating the state were acting under ulterior motives which
amounted to abuse of court process.
</P>
<P>
Mung'omba and Nakatindi Wina, expelled chairperson in charge
of women affairs of the MMD, were charged with treason together
with 77 army soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the state accused them of collaborating
with the soldiers in a foiled military coup in October, 1997 in
attempt to topple the elected government of President Frederick
Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
But during a course of six months' treason trial, none of the
over 100 witnessed called by the state have testified against the
two persons who have been detained by police for at least one
year.
</P>
<P>
After the court ruling, both Mung'omba and Nakatindi Wina,
asked the court to award them costs in the matter after being in
custody for a long time.

TEHRAN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A second stray missile from the
U.S.-British strikes against Iraq was found in southern Iran,

<HEADLINE> Australia's Population Reaches 18.75 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A big rise in the number of
migrants jumping visa categories helped drive Australia's
estimated population to around 18.75 million people in June,
official figures showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said, the
number of people living in Australia at the end of the fiscal year
1997-98 (June 30, 1998), was 18,751,000.
</P>
<P>
The national population growth rate rose slightly during the
year to reach 1.22 percent, up from 1.17 percent in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said net overseas migration - the difference between
arrivals and departures - increased from 87,000 to 106,200 people
in the year to June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for this was a big increase in those jumping
from a short-term visa category to a long-term or permanent
category - up from minus 7,300 in 1996-97 to 27,100 in 1997-98,
the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
The number of people leaving Australia permanently rose 12
percent while permanent arrivals rose two percent.
</P>
<P>
A drop in the number of births and a rise in the number of
deaths saw the natural increase in Australia's population dip five
percent on the previous year to 120,600 people in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The nation's households got smaller last year, with the average
number of people per household dropping from 2.8 people to 2.7
people.

<HEADLINE> China Active in Absorbing Overseas Talent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- China has been absorbing a
wide range of talent in many fields through a variety of channels
over the past several years, according to Wan Xueyuan, director of
the State Administration of Foreign Expert Affairs, adding that
this foreign expertise has given strong impetus to the nation's
economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has brought 170,000 foreign experts to
work in China over the past two years, raising the total number of
such people to 660,000 since China introduced reforms and opening
20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Foreign experts are involved in such fields
as finance and insurance, and medical and legal services, in addition
to the traditional areas of industry, agriculture and educational and
research institutions.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, overseas talent in industrial
sectors has helped realize over 120 achievements in technical
renovation and exploration of new products; while in agricultural,
more than 270 fine new varieties of floral have been introduced.
</P>
<P>
However, Wan also pointed out that problems exist with the
absorption of overseas talent. For example, a mechanism for
spreading the experience gained from the introduction of foreign
talent has not yet formed, and of this talent is redundant,
leading to poor efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the introduction of overseas talent in the next two
years, Wan noted that these people will work mainly to improve
agriculture, deepen state-owned-enterprise reforms, and promote
development in central and western China.

<HEADLINE> A Doubled-edged Blade  by Zhou Shuchun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The much trumpeted process of
economic globalization has been under serious challenges in the
passing year as capital and production move among nations in an
accelerated way in the era of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Accelerated Trans-Nationalization of Capital and Production
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 has seen a huge wave of business merges and an
increasing financial domination in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
They occurred in virtually all sectors, from industry to
financial markets, with a view to lowering cost and increasing
competitiveness against the backdrop of over-production.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of the year, merger deals across the
world totaled 383 billion U.S. dollars, outshining the record
total of last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, direct foreign investment is expected to rise by
10 percent over last year, reaching between 430 and 440 billion
dollars, according to a United Nations report on global investment.
</P>
<P>
In fact, economic globalization has come to take the form of
direct investment in production and, in particular, the real
estate, financial services and information sectors, rather than
the traditional pattern of trade.
</P>
<P>
Despite a reduced growth rate of world economy, financial
capital across the globe has increased by 30 percent in the past
12 months. The ratio of transaction in foreign exchange as against
trade stands around 60:1 at the moment, compared with 10:1 in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
By now, over 50,000 multi-nationals, together with hundreds of
thousands of branches and affiliates, have formed a colossal
network of production and sales covering all parts of the world.
They account for one-third of production, two-thirds of trade, 70
percent of total direct investment and over 70 percent of patent
rights and transfer of technology across the world.
</P>
<P>
A Double-Edged Blade
</P>
<P>
Despite its literal sense, economic globalization has meant
different stories for different countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the current economic order, the developed world continues
to take the lion's share of the globalization cake, and the
developing countries, supporting three-fourths of the world
population, are facing a "double-edged blade" of the process.
</P>
<P>
Globalization allows developing economies access to capital
flows and advanced technology, but giving the reins to foreign
conglomerates. In addition, the new pattern of global industrial
division poses serious environmental and ecological threats to
them, facilitated by an unchecked migration of pollution-causing
and resource-exhausting industries.
</P>
<P>
Based on the Breton Woods agreement half a century ago, the
international financial system has proved insufficient for an
entirely different environment created by economic globalization
and the laws of cross-border capital flow today. This has been
best manifested by the year-long Asian financial crisis which
spilled over to become a full-fledged international turmoil this
summer.
</P>
<P>
The world trade growth is expected to fall by 50 percent from
last year to between 4 and 5 percent this year. With an apparent
rise of protectionism, free trade -- an essential facet of
globalization -- is running up against more barriers.
</P>
<P>
Globalization Calls for New Economic Order
</P>
<P>
As Director-General of the World Trade Organization Renato
Ruggiero put it, the financial chaos this year marks "an important
turning point" in the process of globalization, and the world has
yet to learn how to adapt to an increasingly complicated global
economic system of inter-dependence.
</P>
<P>
General consensus has been reached that supervision and
regulation are necessary for the global markets, while the
emerging markets should be allowed to open up in a cautious and
measured manner.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the north and the south has become more than
ever a hazard, or "time bomb" as in the words of World Bank
President James Wolfensohn, for the security of world economy.
This calls for more official assistance and technology transfer to
the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the traditional pattern of a small group of
industrialized nations sketching the global map of economic
development runs counter to the tides of globalization. There have
been increasing calls for the participation of more players,
including the developing countries and economies in transition, in
the top decision-making process of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
This past eventful year serves to show that only with the
establishment of a reasonable and just international economic
order, whereby all countries benefit to the maximum possible
extent, can economic globalization proceed on a smooth track and
fulfill its promise to ensure long-term stability and prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Australian Superannuation Assets Total 225b U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia's superannuation
assets rose to 364.6 billion Australian dollars (225 billion U.S.
dollars) at the end of September, 1998, the official Australian
Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest bulletin released, APRA, a newly-established
government body, said total assets were up nine percent on the
previous year, with equity and trust holdings accounting for 36.8
percent of the total assets, down slightly.
</P>
<P>
Interest-bearing securities accounted for 24.9 percent, up
slightly.
</P>
<P>
Self-managed funds, including small funds with five or fewer
members, experienced the strongest growth, with assets in this
part of the market growing by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The July 1998 increase in the compulsory employer contribution
rate from six to seven percent contributed to a 15-percent
increase in assets to 13.51 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The number of member superannuation accounts rose three percent
during the September quarter to 18.8 million.
</P>
<P>
Contributions during the year to September 1998 totaled 22
billion U.S. dollars, up from 18.35 billion U.S. dollars in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Benefit payments rose 13.1 percent in the year to September,
totaling 13.2 billion U.S. dollars, up from 11.6 billion U.S.
dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Assets directly invested by trustees showed the strongest
growth during the September quarter, up 2.1 percent, while
investment managers had 39.1 percent of the total superannuation
assets, or 88.35 billion U.S. dollars, at the end of the quarter,
up from 38.8 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The share of superannuation assets invested overseas fell
during the September quarter to 15.7 percent, or 35.5 billion U.S.
dollars, down 1.79 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said the change
in mix of investments suggested more volatile equity and overseas
markets had led to superannuation funds adopting a more defensive
investment strategy.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Consumers Still Prefer Domestic Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Quality-conscious Chinese
consumers are more likely to buy domestic goods than foreign
products, according to a recent national survey.
</P>
<P>
Today's Economic Daily reports that the survey by China Central
Television Station (CCTV) found that 35 of the 60 best-selling
name brand products are Chinese brands.
</P>
<P>
The survey was of 16,461 types of foodstuff, beverages,
cigarettes, garments, cosmetics, and electronics,
telecommunications, and transportation items and 9,200 people in
34 major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the results indicate that Chinese
consumers are becoming more mature in choosing and are demanding
not only high quality and reasonable prices, but also convenience
and good after-sale service.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that most consumers think that quality is more
important than price and popularity.
</P>
<P>
However, buyers of durable goods are more likely to be
influenced by advertisements and the reommendation of friends and
relatives.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Current Account Deficit Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- There has been a small
improvement in the deficit in New Zealand's current account, which
 measures the difference between how much it spends and buys.
</P>
<P>
Statistics New Zealand said Tuesday that in the year to
September, New Zealand spent 6.5 billion N.Z. dollars (3.38
billion U.S. dollars) more than it earned overseas.
</P>
<P>
That compares with a deficit of 6.2 billion N.Z. dollars (3.22
billion U.S. dollars) in the year to June, and a fractionally
higher deficit in the year to September 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, Statistics NZ said that on a seasonally adjusted
basis, the current account deficit improved between the second
and third quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
Exports of commodities were up by 597 million N.Z. dollars (310
 million U.S. dollars) in the third quarter, it said.
</P>
<P>
This was an improved export performance despite the Asian
economic downturn, though the second quarter result had been
particularly bad, N.Z. Deputy Government Statistician Ian Ewing
said in the media release.

BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Water conservation projects
have helped flood control in central-south China's Hunan Province,
while generating 38 billion yuan (4.6 billion US dollars) in
direct profits, according to a report in a recent issue of "China
Water Resources News."

<HEADLINE> China's largest Coal Supplier to Close Illegal Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province
has mapped out a plan to shut down 2,908 illegal coal mines by the
end of next year, 11 percent of all the coal mines under the state
plans to close.
</P>
<P>
This move is aimed at cutting coal output by 69.8 million tons
annually, which will account for 30 percent of China's targeted
amount to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters this year, China's key coal firms
reported large deficits resulting from oversupply of coal.
Economists attribute the glut to rampant production by
small coal mines, which produced 46.6 percent of the country's
coal last year.
</P>
<P>
Shutting down coal mines that are operating illegally or have
been planned irrationally is a major step in the current reform to
pull the coal industry out of stagnation.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to close some 25,800 small
coal mines to bring annual national output down by some 250
million tons by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Coal mining is a major industry in Shanxi where one-quarter of
the country's coal output is produced annually. The province has
eight key state-owned coal mines employing a total of one-million
people.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have drafted specific measures to implement
the closings, and the province will not approve any more coal
mines during the closure period. Certificates will no longer be
granted to these small coal mines, nor will they any longer have
access to transportation, sales or operational facilities.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Official on Economic Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Tuesday described 1998 as a year of proving its economic
resilience and was optimistic about the prospects for further
consolidation and recovery in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Felipe Medalla, the Philippines' Socioeconomic Planning
Secretary and Director-General of National Economic and
Development Authority, told reporters that the country's economy
has avoided a recession and is now assured of a positive growth of
Gross National Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Releasing the 1998 Year-End Report on the Economy, Medalla said
the government estimates the GNP would grow by about 0.5 to 1.0
percent this year with a 0.8 percent of growth for the first three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said the crucial recovery of agriculture and industry
would likely drive the GNP up to 3.0 to 3.5 percent and Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) to 2.6 to 3.1 percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that in responding to economic challenge, the
government has taken measures of overcoming short-run problems,
achieving long-run goals, and balancing economic, fiscal and
social objectives.
</P>
<P>
He cited these measures as stabilizing and pump priming the
economy, strengthening the financial system, carrying out
market-oriented policies and protecting the vulnerable sectors.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, with the economy slowed down, the average
unemployment rate registered in the first three Labor Force
Surveys this year rose to 10.3 percent from 9 percent a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
With the depreciation of the Philippine currency peso and the
effect of El Nino on food prices, inflation accelerated, he said.
The average inflation rate for January to November stood at an
average of 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the exchange rate adjustments also brought about the
reversal of country's trade position from a deficit of 9.5 billion
U.S. dollars a year ago to a much smaller deficit of 838 million
dollars in the first 10 months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Medalla anticipated that the probability of a recovery in 1999
will be stronger as the government generates additional foreign
financing for its programmed deficit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the proposed budget for 1999, if finally approved by
Congress, remains pro-growth and pro-poor, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Coffee Production Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's coffee output rose to
12,865 tons in the first quarter of fiscal 1998/99 year compared
with just 4,812 tons in the same period of 1997/98, according to
the Coffee Board of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The board spokesman Paul Kivila said Monday that crop intake
in the first quarter (which runs from October to December) was a
vast improvement over the miserable showing a year ago, he was
quoted by The People newspaper Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Coffee crop in Kenya fell to just 47,000 tons in 1997/98 and
traders here have forecast a crop of 52,000 tons in 1998/99.
</P>
<P>
Kivila said it was to early to forecast 1998/99 production,
adding that poor weather was still a problem.
</P>
<P>
"We have done well in terms of production in the first
quarter. Prices have also been firm and real farm earning have
been good," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is still cause of concern. "Rains are not
sufficient in crop growing areas and this is causing some worry
about the year's total crop figure."

<HEADLINE> Protecting Human Rights Calls for Punishing Criminals: Article (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article notes that promoting and protecting human rights
are important components and a goal of China's reform and opening
up and socialist modernization construction. These are part of an
established policy of the Chinese government worked out in
accordance with China's realities and the basic rights and
interests of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The article says the Chinese government has stood firm in
carrying out the reform and opening policy, and the policy of
promoting human rights, over the past two decades even though
faced with national and international turmoil and political,
economic and media pressures from Western countries.
</P>
<P>
The article says that President Jiang Zemin reiterated in his
letter to the meeting marking the 50th anniversary of the
U.N. Universal Human Rights Declaration that the Chinese
government will further promote the protection of human rights and
fully guarantee people's right to enjoy human rights, democracy
and freedom according to law.
</P>
<P>
The article stresses that there is no doubt that China's reform
and opening-up policy and protection of human rights will not
change at present or in the future. China will, as always, improve
human rights and conduct cooperation with other countries to push
forward the healthy development of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that some Western media organizations
and people are ignorant of China's human-rights policy when they
say that China's reform and opening-up policy will be "reversed"
and accuse China of "retrogression in political reform" based on
their view of the case of Xu Wenli and a few others.

WUHAN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- An intermediate people's court
in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei Province, found Qin Yongmin
guilty of subverting state power and sentenced him to 12 years in
prison today.
</P>
<P>
Qin was also deprived of political rights fro three years by the
Wuhan Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
In an open trial, the court found that, in November this year,
Qin secretly planned to found the "Hubei Provincial Committee of
the China Democratic Party", an illegal organization, with the
purpose of subverting state power and the socialist system.
</P>
<P>
The court also found that Qin had formulated "constitution" and
"announcement" about the "party" and sought and accepted funds from
some hostile overseas organizations to organize, plan and conduct
subversive activities.
</P>
<P>
A court investigation found that Qin had used various means to
stir up subversive activities since March of this year. After
hearing arguments by prosecutors and the defense, the court ruled
that, in accordance with China's Criminal Law, Qin's activities
constituted the crime of subverting state power, that Qin is a
recidivist, and that he should be punished accordingly.

Qin's family and members of the public were present at today's
court hearing.

CANBERRA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australia-Papua New
Guinea (PNG) Ministerial Forum concluded its two-day meeting
Tuesday in Cairns, the northeast city of the country.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released at the end of the meeting, the
PNG government's approach to the Bougainville peace process was
described as "constructive and flexible."
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said during a
post- forum news conference that in spite of the failure of the
PNG parliament to pass crucial legislation needed to set up the
Bougainville reconciliation government, he personally hoped the
PNG parliament would resume and pass the legislation.
</P>
<P>
"But I am satisfied the commitment is there to put together
workable arrangements," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"There are interim arrangements in place to support the peace
process and there would be problems if we withdrew, but how long
it will go on depends on how the peace process moves forward," he
said.
</P>
<P>
PNG Foreign Minister Roy Yaki emphasized the need for the
continuation of the Bougainville aid program.
</P>
<P>
"The Peace Monitoring Group must not become a permanent
fixture," Yaki said.
</P>
<P>
"The aid program is a high priority, because it delivers a
peace dividend in the form of restoration and reconstruction."
</P>
<P>
Australia responded to the request by agreeing to speed up
spending on roads and a peace travel fund, and to continue with
assistance in training a Bougainville police force.

<P>
HARARE, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Namibia and Zimbabwe have
denied reports from Angola by UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi that
they have troops in that country to help President Jose Dos
Santos's government fight the rebels.
</P>
<P>
UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, said in a statement earlier that Namibian and Zimbabwean
troops entered the country last Friday under the auspices of the
Southern African Development Community's security organ.
</P>
<P>
The Herald newspaper in Zimbabwe reported Tuesday that
Brigadier Mathias Shiweda, chief of staff operations in the
Namibian Defense Force, said that his country did have troops
helping United Nations forces with demining operations, but it
had not sent any troops to back the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
He said, "there is no such thing. UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
should not try and derail the peace process by claiming that we
are threatening him by supporting the Angolan government forces."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior official, who was not named, of the
Zimbabwean Defense Ministry Monday said that Zimbabwe had not
sent troops into Angola, according to the daily Herald.
</P>
<P>
But on his way back from a meeting in Ouagadougou, Burkina
Faso, at the weekend, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said
Savimbi was a war criminal who must be sought and defeated. He
urged all countries to isolate him.
</P>
<P>
This may have been misconstrued to mean that Zimbabwe and
Namibia will hunt down Savimbi, said the Zimbabwean official.

</P>
<P>
The gene bank has semen from 30 South China Tigers for future
artificial insemination of the endangered species. There are only

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The referee, who stopped
Mike Tyson's fight against Evander Holyfield in the ear-biting
title challenge, has decided to retire.
</P>
<P>
Mills Lane said Monday he will end his 31-year career as a
referee because he wants to devote more time as a national
television boxing analyst.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a blast, a real heluva ride," he said. "But I think
it would be a conflict of interest to make public comment and at
the same time be an active referee."
</P>
<P>
Lane refereed fights involving nearly every boxing great of
recent decades. His career as a referee began in 1964.

<HEADLINE> Protecting Human Rights Calls for Punishing Criminals: Article (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The signed article goes on to say that no country in the
world has perfect human rights, and stresses that in order to
fairly judge a country's human-rights situation, focus should not
be only on a few people or a certain thing at a certain time, but
rather on the overall trend of development. It must also be judged
in a practical manner with an eye to history, and this is also
true of China's human rights conditions.
</P>
<P>
It says that since the founding of New China, and especially
since the reform and opening up, the Chinese government has
exerted greater efforts to develop its economy and has stressed
the construction of a democratic and legal system which will
enable the Chinese people to better enjoy the right to subsistence
and development, as well as political, economic, social, cultural
and other rights.
</P>
<P>
The article cites as an example the fact that China has helped
more than 200 million people shake off poverty in the past two
decades, and 1.2 billion Chinese people are enjoying better
material and cultural lives.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt, the article notes, that the people of China
are enjoying unprecedented human rights and freedom, even though
there are still some things that need to be improved in
human-rights protection due to the restrictions of nature, history
and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The article says it is irresponsible and a pity that some
people and mass media organizations in the United States and other
Western countries have the desire to focus on some so-called
"individual cases," especially criminal cases involving the
subversion of state power, take them as "evidence proving that
China infringes upon human rights," and describe China's human
rights conditions as hopeless, disregarding China's overall
human-rights conditions and realities.
</P>
<P>
The article continues that there are only a small number of
people in China involved in activities threatening the national
security, and points out that what some Western people and mass
media organizations are really concerned about is not the human
rights of the mass of the Chinese people, but the "rights" of a
small number of people who attempt to overturn the Chinese
government and destroy China's stability.
</P>
<P>
If the punishment of a small number of criminals in accordance
with law is described as the human rights conditions of the 1.2
billion Chinese people, it is no surprise they shout that China's
human rights conditions are "going backwards" when hearing that
people like Xu Wenli were punished according to law, the article
says.

<HEADLINE> Trade Gap Between Bangladesh, India Likely to Mount </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's trade deficit with
India is likely to reach 2 billion U.S. dollars in the current
fiscal year starting from July 1998, an English daily newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The trade between the two countries is greatly imbalanced in
favor of the latter, with the official trade with India being
about one billion dollars, The New Nation quoted speakers at a
round-table discussion held here Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
But if the illegal imports are taken into consideration, the
actual trade deficit with India will be in the magnitude of 2
billion dollars, they added.
</P>
<P>
Though India had given Bangladesh some tariff concession, "we
are not enjoying these concessions," Commerce and Industries
Minister Tofael Ahmed complained.
</P>
<P>
India announced withdrawal of tariff on 2,000 export items from
Bangladesh but in real terms "we don't know where it is
happening," he said, adding the number of export items from
Bangladesh to India needed to be discussed thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
The speakers urged both sides, the Indian side in particular,
to take concrete steps to mitigate the serious trade imbalance
between the two South Asian countries.

<P>
Xu's crime of using foreign funds to subvert the legitimate
Chinese government and jeopardize state security has been
well established with specific evidence, the article concluded.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that "it is logical that the Chinese
judiciary bring such criminals before the law in order to protect
the human rights of the Chinese people and safeguard the dignity
of the law."
</P>
<P>
In fact, such high crimes are intolerable in any state with
the rule of law and to any responsible government, it said.
</P>
<P>
The article cited an example from the law of the United States
itself, sarcastically noting that "the U.S. law forbids the use
of foreign money even in political campaigns, much less for
overturning the government."
</P>
<P>
It referred to Articles 2381 to 2391 in Chapter 18 of the
"Statute of the United States," saying that harsh penalties are
prescribed for abusing the rights of freedom of expression and
association to harm national security.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 2385, it said, those who intend to preach,
instigate, persuade or expound on the reason why the government of
the United States should be overthrown or destroyed, including by
the means of printing, publishing, releasing, passing, selling,
distributing or exhibiting any books or printed materials in
public, are subject to punishment of up to 20 years imprisonment
and/or a fine of 20,000 U.S. dollars.

RIO DE JANEIRO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's soccer star
Ronaldo said here on Monday that French World Cup hero Zinedine
Zidane deserves to win the award of FIFA's Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
"For everything he has done this year, Zidane deserves the rec
ognition of FIFA," he told the Estado news agency after arriving

</P>
<P>
Ronaldo has won the award for the past two years. Zidane,
Ronaldo and Croatia's Davor Suker are on this year's list for the
award.
</P>
<P>
However, Brazilian commentators said Ronald would be hard to
win the title given his performance at the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has been plagued by knee tendon problems.
</P>
<P>
During the break, Ronaldo is expected to have his injured knee
treated by his private physiotherapist.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A group of International
Olympic Committee members have used blocks of votes in seeking
for extravagant gifts and favors from the Olympics bidding
cities, a resigned IOC member from the United States said today.
</P>
<P>
Robert Helmick, who resigned from the IOC and as president of
the U.S. Olympic Committee in 1991, said the gifts could range
from fur coats to shopping sprees for members'wives.
</P>
<P>
He also said that $5,000 to $10,000 in first-class airfare for
each member and spouse was "the minimun that's expected before
they get to the gifts. That's tit for tat."
</P>
<P>
Helmick refused to identify any IOC members or bid committees
involved in corruption.
</P>
<P>
"It's the system. It's people without a constituency dealing
with a lot of money, without checks and balances. That leads to
corruption without the people being corrupt."
</P>
<P>
Helmick pointed out that "there are several IOC members who
control blocks of votes who are willing to deliver them for
extravagant gifts and favors."
</P>
<P>
Helmick said he never was approached by a bid city offering
enticements during his five years on the IOC.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Refugees Repatriation Stalled in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The repatriation of Myanmar
refugees staying in Bangladesh has been stalled again less than
one month after it was resumed late November.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar authorities recently conveyed to Bangladesh that it
could not take back the Rohingya refugees during the Ramadan, the
holy month of fasting for Muslims across the world.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, on the other hand, insisted that it would continue
the repatriation process in accordance with the agreement reached
earlier between the two sides, The Bangladesh Observer newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has decided to send a special delegation to Myanmar
late this month to discuss the issue with the Myanmar government,
after a meeting here last Saturday between Foreign Minister Abudus
Samad Azad and Myanmar's Deputy Foreign Minister U Khin Maung Win.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar minister was here to attend a ministerial meeting
last Saturday of the Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand
Economic Cooperation forum, a newly-established regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Rohingyas from Myanmar crossed into Bangladesh in
early 1991, and took shelter in Cox's Bazar and Bandarban, two
districts in southeastern Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
During the past seven years, 230,000 refugees have returned
voluntarily, and the remaining 21,000 in two refugees camps are
awaiting repatriation. The repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar
came to a halt in July 1997 reportedly as a result of the
refugees' refusal to return.
</P>
<P>
After several rounds of discussions between Dhaka and Rangoon,
the Myanmar government agreed to take back 7,000 of the refugees,
and according to the latest arrangement between the two countries,
50 refugees in a batch would be repatriated every Wednesday
beginning November 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
Only 100 refugees have been repatriated so far because the
non-availability of permission from the Myanmar government and the
unwillingness of some refugees to return, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Based on explanations of many cases by federal courts, the
freedom of expression shall not obstruct the American constitution
and publications shall not viciously slander or intend to subvert
the government, the article said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, the United States does not allow anti-government
activities that harm national security, so why are court hearings
in China dealing with the same crime dubbed a 'violation of human
rights?'" the article asks.
</P>
<P>
Some Western media or personages have accused China of
"violating human rights" because Xu Wenli and some others are
"dissidents."
</P>
<P>
It is well-known that dissidents are those who hold political
beliefs other than those of the existing government, the article
admitted.
</P>
<P>
From the point of view of human-rights activists, citizens
should not be punished or be prejudiced against for their political
ideas, but this does not say that dissidents should be free from
punishment even if they perpetrate crimes, the article said.
</P>
<P>
In China, it said that the citizen's freedom of thought and
expression are protected by law, and those with political ideas
different from those of the government and who do not breach the
penal code in deed, are not liable to criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, those dissidents, just as other citizens, are
entitled to all the political and civil rights of citizenship
provided for by the Constitution and law, and are not prejudiced
against or violated by any organization or individual, it said.
</P>
<P>
Those who do not intentionally ignore facts should recognize
that it is very common for Chinese citizens to hold and air their
political ideas, even if they are not consistent with those of the
authorities. And many with different political ideas or religious
beliefs have been elected deputies to the people's congresses or
members of people's political consultative conferences, the article
noted.
</P>
<P>
Xu was punished not for his political ideas, but for his
subversive crimes, and those who ignore his crimes but accuse the
Chinese judiciary of "suppressing the dissidents" are misleading
the international community and deliberately throwing mud at
China, the article pointed out.

WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Patrick Ewing, the New
York Knicks star and union president, has different idea from
Karl Malone about NBA's latest offer. He doesn't think the
proposal "fair" and "decent".
</P>
<P>
"The deal is the same deal we've been going over for the last
two or three weeks -- maybe even longer," Ewing said. "They
haven't changed their position. All they did was make the numbers
look great, but it's not a good deal."
</P>
<P>
Malone called the offer "fair and decent" yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The union's negotiating committee held an internal meeting
Monday with about 125 players listening in on a conference call.
</P>
<P>
It was the ninth day since the sides met, and players continue
to lose $50 million a week in salaries as the lockout drags on.
No new talks are scheduled. Commissioner David Stern is on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
If a deal isn't reached soon, the entire season will be
scrapped. Sonics center Jim McIlvaine supported Ewing.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of stumbling blocks in order to make the deal
and the big one is control," McIlvaine said. "Thay could be a
presidential definition of 'tweak'. 'Tweak' for him could mean a
major modification for someone else.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the numbers, they look good. The superstars
are going to get their money, but we're trying to take care of

BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A signed article published
here today says that some Western media and figures accusing China
of "retrogression" in human rights know nothing about China's
human rights policy.
</P>
<P>
The article written by Ren Yanshi says that recently some media
and figures in the United States and other western countries have
been whipping up opinion against China's trial by law of Xu Wenli
and others, convicted of subversion of the government.
</P>
<P>
It says that the western media's accusation that China has
"cracked down on dissidents" based on Xu's case is obviously a
distortion of China's human rights situation and shows an
ignorance of China's human rights policy.
</P>
<P>
The article says that Xu Wenli, who colluded with hostile
overseas organizations and individuals and accepted overseas funds
to engage in subversion of the government, had violated the
Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
It also says that it is quite normal for China's public
security and judicial departments to arrest and try Xu Wenli
according to law, noting that the trial is purely the
internal matter of a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
It is unreasonable for some media and figures in the United
States and other Western countries to characterize China's lawful
punishment of criminals as an infringement of human rights, it
says, adding that these accusations have deliberately confused the
boundary between normal judicial actions and human rights.

<P>
The article says that dealing with crime and protecting human
rights are two aspects of one problem. In the final analysis,
dealing with crime safeguards the human rights of the people.
</P>
<P>
On one hand, China's Constitution and laws clearly stipulate
that citizens enjoyed the freedom of speech, assembly, association
and belief, and they are protected while exercising these rights,
it says.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Constitution also stipulates that when
citizens are enjoying their rights of freedom, they must not harm
the interests of the State, the society and the collectives, or
the freedom and rights of other citizens, the article says.
</P>
<P>
All acts against the Constitution and laws should be punished,
it says.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that stipulations of Chinese law comply with
the "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights" of the
United Nations, which says in Article 18 to 22 that while the
freedom of belief, speech, assembly and association is enjoyed, it
should also be limited according to law.
</P>

Freedom cannot undermine State and public security, public
order, health and morality, or the freedom and rights of others it

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cabinet Approves Spy Satellites Launch Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese cabinet Tuesday
approved a plan to launch information-gathering satellites by the
2002 financial year in a bid to boost the country's reconnaissance
capability.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Japan will launch four satellites, said
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka, who added that two
of them will be optical, while the other two will use radar,
allowing them to function even in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
In a draft budget for fiscal 1999 approved Monday by the
cabinet, the Science and Technology Agency, which will be in
charge of making and launching the satellites, was allocated 6.8
billion yen (about 58.6 million U.S. dollars) for the plan.
</P>
<P>
Japan announced the launching plan after the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea fired a rocket in August 31. Part of
the rocket, which Japan claimed was a multistage ballistic
missile, flew over Japan into the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Postpones Establishment of Civilian Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to postpone the establishment of a civilian militia until
at least a law on trained civilians is issued, the Jakarta Post
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Muladi confirmed the delay and announced
that the government had completed the draft law, which would be
submitted to the House of Representatives next month.
</P>
<P>
"The draft law on the establishment of a civilian militia will
be submitted to the House in January," he told reporters after a
limited ministerial meeting on political and security affairs here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The planned establishment of the civilian militia was
introduced by Minister of Defense and Security Gen. Wiranto
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who argued that the plan is both constitutional and
necessary because of the low ratio of police to the population,
came under strong criticism from human rights groups here and
abroad when the Armed Forces used 125,000 civilian guards to boost
security at last month's special session of the People's
Consultative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Human rights activists, legislators and analysts criticized the
deployment of these civilian guards as they regularly ended up
brawling with residents and student protesters.

<P>
COLOMBO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka's industrial
community has imported 1.16 billion U.S. dollars worth of
investment goods during the first 10 months of 1998 to modernize
existing industries and a few new industries, officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to an Industries Development Ministry official, this
capital formation will immensely help strengthen the industrial
sector and to meet the challenges in emerging tariff free markets.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan industrialists have also imported 2.42 billion
dollars worth of intermediate goods during the same period for
expansion of production in their factories, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, the ministry has approved over 505
industrial projects with investments worth 500 million dollars
under an Advanced Technology Tax Incentive Scheme.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of providing massive concessions to local
industries is to equip them with modern machinery and equipment to
compete in the world market, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The proposed "investor incentives for 1998" have further
stimulated the industrial sector in areas such as rubber goods,
ceramic products, electronic goods, and gem and jewelry products,
the ministry official said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Govt Appointees Vacate Parliament Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of parliamentarians
vacated their seats in the National Assembly Tuesday after the
assembly approved a draft law barring government officials from
holding parliamentary positions.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, about 14 newly elected Cambodian People's Party
(CPP) parliamentarians and 16 FUNCINPEC lawmakers who have been
appointed ministers or secretaries of state as well as other state
high rankings have vacated their seats in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
Among them are Chea Sim, CPP President and the would-be
president of the Senate, Khieu Kanarhidh, Secretary of State for
Information, Prince Sisowath Sirirath, co-Minister of Defense, and
Uk Vithun, Minister of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Their positions were filled by colleagues appointed by their
parties according to the party candidate list. New
parliamentarians were already sworn in Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The move could drastically alter the face of the assembly, as
ministers and state secretaries held more than 20 seats in the
last parliament. One pro-democracy activist hailed the move as a
boost to the independence of the legislative branch from the
executive.
</P>
<P>
Ky Lam Ang, a member of the assembly's Permanent Committee,
said that making sure parliamentarians hold only one job should
make it easier for the nine key commissions in the parliament to
achieve quorums.
</P>
<P>
Lack of quorums in commissions is now holding up the draft
budget law and draft constitutional amendments to create a Senate.
Over the past year, failures to meet quorums have delayed Assembly
efforts to pass election legislation.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Still Prepared to Evacuate Nationals in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is still prepared to
evacuate its nationals from Iraq although U.S. and British
warplanes has stopped strikes against that country, foreign
ministry officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand believed that tension remained high in the region
despite the end of the air strikes, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain launched a series of air attacks
against Iraq last week, alleging that Iraq failed to destroy its
mass-destructive weapons in light with relevant U.N. resolutions.
The strikes ended on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The tension is still high in Iraq although the U.S. and the
U.K. have halted their assault on the country," Thai Foreign
Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said.
</P>
<P>
All Thais, mostly students who had volunteered to evacuate in
the wake of last week's air strikes, have returned to their
residences in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"The Thai Embassy in Baghdad will work with the Indonesian and
Filipino embassies to urge the Iraqi authorities to permit Thai
students to cross into Jordan if an evacuation gets underway. We
will also ask Iraq to allow the students to re-enter the country
after the crisis ends," Kobsak said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Fall by 3.3 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's total export volume
fell by 3.3 percent year-on-year in October, the first such drop
since the baht was floated in July last year, the Commerce
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Although Thailand continued to register a trade surplus for 14
consecutive months, October export values shrank by 12.7 percent
in dollar terms to 4.63 billion U.S. dollars, its eighth
consecutive month of fall, the ministry said in a report, made
public on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The drop occurred in all product categories especially
agriculture and the agro-industry which witnessed a fall in values
by 14.6 percent and 20.4 percent, respectively, while volumes
decreased by 9.5 percent and 36.3 percent, respectively," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
In baht terms, exports showed a 7.5 percent year-on-year
decline against a 36.9 percent rise during January-October 1998.
Thai exporters have criticized the government for allowing the
baht to get stronger compared with currencies of competing
countries.
</P>
<P>
During the 10-month period, Thailand's exports dipped by 6.4
percent to 45.28 billion dollars. Export volumes increased
continuously by an average of 9 percent, but export prices were
down by 14.3 percent, mainly on agriculture and agro-industry
products..
</P>
<P>
For manufactured exports, prices also faced downward pressure
due to increased competition from South Korea and China,
especially for ready-made garments, fabrics, footwear and plastic
parts and products.
</P>
<P>
On imports, shipments in dollar terms fell by 35.2 percent in
the first 10 months, compared with the same period last year.
Imports in October went down by 23.7 percent, the 16th consecutive
monthly fall.
</P>
<P>
In baht terms, imports fell by 3.4 percent year-on-year, with
October imports falling by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
The October trade surplus was 1.01 billion dollars, the 13th
consecutive month of trade surplus. Surpluses are recorded with
the U.S., the EU, and ASEAN (excluding Malaysia), but Thailand
still has trade deficits with Japan, the Middle East, Malaysia,
Australia, China's Taiwan, China and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
A sharp decline in imports is due to low local demand, a
slowdown of investment and the intensified liquidity crunch.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Portugal's economy is expected
to grow at a rate of 3 percent in 1999, according to a survey
report of some Portuguese financial experts.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the growth of the domestic demand and
lower interest rate will become the two major factors supporting
the development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Owing to a rise of four to 4.5 percentage in domestic demand in
1998, the import and export of the country have increased 13.5
percent and 10.25 percent, respectively, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But it said that in 1999 the export of Portugal will grow at a
lower speed of 4 percent because of a decline in consumers'
confidence and weak domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Finalize Probe of Abduction Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Monday ordered an immediate trial of 11 members of the
Army's Special Forces (Kopassus) allegedly involved the abductions
of at least 24 pro-democracy activists some time ago.
</P>
<P>
"The president appreciated the Joint Fact-Finding Team findings
and their report," State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung said.
</P>
<P>
"He (Habibie) has ordered an immediate trial of Kopassus
members in order to establish the possible involvement of former
Commander of Army Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad) Lt. Gen.
(ret.) Prabowo Subianto in the abduction of activists," Akbar
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, did not disclose the contents of the
Joint Fact-Finding Team findings, according to national newspapers
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo, a son-in-law of former president Soeharto, was chief
of Kopassus when the kidnappings took place. He has admitted his
wrong-doing in the abductions of more than 20 political activists
early this year and said he would be responsible for the cases.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo commanded Kopassus for more than two years before he
was appointed commander of Kostrad last March. Prabowo was
permanently discharged from military service after he admitted
that he had presided over a number of the abductions, and
officially became a retired lieutenant general on December 10.
</P>
<P>
Akbar said the government would soon finish its investigations
on members of Kopassus suspected of being involved in the
abductions of political activists.
</P>
<P>
"The process will be aimed at ascertaining the extent of
retired Lt. Gen. Prabowo's involvement in the cases," Akbar told
reporters after a meeting between Habibie and a number of cabinet
ministers who discussed the government's position regarding the
team's findings.
</P>
<P>
According to Coordinator of the Commission for Missing Persons
and Victims of Violence Munir, the trial of 11 members of Kopassus
will start Wednesday at a military court.

The report attributed the increase to the low birth rate and
increasing longevity.

However, it said, that only 16 percent of the over-65s were

weapons and a gross violation of specific orders laid down by the
LTTE leader.
</P>
<P>
They have reportedly been taken to a torture chamber in a LTTE
camp in Mallaitivu.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that the arrest of the Mallaitivu leader
indicates a growing division within the ranks of the LTTE and a
turning point in the scenario of LTTE operations as he had played
an active role in Mullaitivu, the domain of LTTE activity.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a war against the government for a
separate state in the north and east of the country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Parliamentarians Oppose Dutch Prince's IOC Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Dutch opposition
parliamentarians opposed that Prince Willem-Alexander would
become an official member of the International Olympic Committee,
according to reports from Hague, the Netherlands on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Prince, heir to the throne, elected to the IOC at the
Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, is due to be installed in June.
</P>
<P>
"Recent reports prove again that the IOC is mixed up with
dubious practices," said Paul Rosenmoeller, leader of the Green
Left party. "That is not the ideal company for our future king."
</P>
<P>
Rosenmoeller was supported by the Socialist Party. However,
the ruling coalition said they wanted to debate the Prince's IOC
membership after the IOC investigation on corruption and
vote-buying was over.
</P>
<P>
The Royal House declined comment on the prince's membership.
</P>
<P>
Dutch IOC member Anton Geesink on Monday denied a report in
German magazine Der Spiegel that he was one of five members
implicated in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
"I took no money from Salt Lake City or anybody else," the
64-year-old said, "I also never sent any children to study in
America at their expense. They must have me confused with
somebody else."

<P>
BRASILIA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's 1998-99 coffee
harvest will total 34.55 million 60-kilo bags, a 23 percent
increase over the previous year's 28 million bag harvest.
</P>
<P>
Industry, Commerce and Tourism Minister Jose Botafogo Goncalves
said on Monday that coffee exports next year would be valued at
2.1 billion U.S. dollars, a 9.3 percent drop over 1998's 2.4
billion dollars, due to the collapse of prices on world markets.
</P>
<P>
Botafogo predicted that Brazil's 1999-2000 coffee harvest would
drop 33 percent to 23.15 million 60-kilo bags, due to high
temperatures and scarce rains in the states of Espirito Santo and
Bahia.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter.

<HEADLINE> Thai Muslims Collect Donations for Iraqis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Muslim organizations in
southern Thailand said they would send donations to fellow Muslims
in Iraq and boycott American products in protest against the
U.S.-led bombing attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
About 50 representatives of the Islamic committees of the five
southernmost provinces, private Islamic groups and Muslim student
organizations agreed on the action during their meeting in the
southern province of Yala on Monday, Tuesday's Nation newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Monday's resolution was in line with an earlier platform
adopted by the Association of Moslem Youths of Thailand against
the bombing of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Association president Anantachai Thaiprathan was quoted as
saying the group was soliciting donations for suffering fellow
Muslims in Baghdad and will submit a protest letter to the U.S.
and British embassies.
</P>
<P>
The association would launch a campaign to boycott imported and
locally-produced merchandise of U.S. and British brands by
circulating a letter to Muslim organizations nationwide to seek
their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It would open a website next week for Thai Muslims to express
their opinions about the attacks on Iraq, said Anantachai.
</P>
<P>
The group would also demand the government clearly show its
official stand towards the attacks.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to go forward in the long term. We do not want the
move to be just a provisional reaction to the attacks," Anantachai
said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Muslims would also cooperate with international Muslim
organizations to protest against the attacks on Iraq and
scrutinize the United Nations for its failure to stop such use of
force, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes raided Baghdad in a series of
attacks last week for Iraq's alleged defiance of U.N. resolutions
on the destruction of the country's weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE>   Norway Has No Plan to Join EU, Says PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Prime Minister
Kjell Magne Bondevik said Monday that Norway has no plan to join
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Christmas press conference in Oslo, Bondevik said
that Norway will increase its cooperation with the EU through the
European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Economic
Area.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it does not mean that Norway will join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Demark and
Portugal are the seven formal members of the EFTA, which was set
up in 1960. The seven countries formed the European Economic Area
in 1992, setting the free flow of commodities, people, capital and
labor as its goal.
</P>
<P>
Bondevik dismissed the view that it is time to reconsider the
entry issue since great changes have taken place since 1994, when
a national referendum prevented Norway from joining the EU.
</P>
<P>
This kind of view is not correct, Bondevik said.
</P>
<P>
Since Norway is one of the most advanced countries in the
world, it lost nothing in staying outside the EU, he said. On the
contrary, Norway is getting very well under the current situation,
he added.

The international community should quickly resume its talks

said.

And this represented the most important task for the United

<HEADLINE> Supervision on Liquor to Be Tightened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 22 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the holiday
season, the government has issued a caution against buying fake
liquor, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision said it
will tighten supervision of liquor sales and production to prevent
widespread poisoning during the coming New Year and Spring
Festival season.
</P>
<P>
In a document issued yesterday, the bureau cautioned residents
against buying of fake liquor, which is still on sale in some
localities.
</P>
<P>
Recently, two men in Huangbu Township, Quxian County in
east China's Zhejiang Province, were poisoned by industrial-grade
alcohol that had been sold as liquor. One of the men was blinded.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the toxic liquor is sold by profiteers mixing
industrial alcohol with water. The bureau also called on
industrial alcohol producers to clearly mark their product as
"inedible."
</P>
<P>
The bureau strongly called for local government agencies to
clamp down on fake liquor sales to forestall a repeat of the
dozens of deaths caused by tainted alcohol earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, 39 cases of profiteers selling toxic liquor passed
off as drinking alcohol have been uncovered and they have resulted
in the deaths of 202 drinkers.

UNITED NATIONS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Monday voted 15-0 to adopt a resolution, calling for the
establishment of a national unity government in Guinea-Bissau and
for holding elections in the West African country by the end of
March next year.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also urged the government and armed rebels to
carry out agreements they had reached, including a ceasefire and
an immediate opening of the airport and seaport in the nation's
capital of Bissau.
</P>
<P>
The resolution appealed for the withdrawal of foreign troops
from the former Portuguese colony and the simultaneous deployment
of a force of the West African peace-keepers, known as ECOMOG, in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The force is meant to keep the two sides apart and guarantee
security along the border with Senegal, which sent troops to
support President Joao Bernardo Vieira after fighting broke out on
June 7 between loyalist forces and fired army chief Ansumane Mane.
</P>
<P>
The council asked Secretary-General Kofi Annan to make
recommendations on a possible U.N. role in the process of peace
and reconciliation in Guinea-Bissau, including the early
establishment of an arrangement for liaison between the United
Nations and ECOMOG.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa moved back to the
top of the English Premier League when an own goal helped Villa a
crucial 1-0 win over Charlton Athletic on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Unlucky defender Richard Rufus set up the visitors victory at
the Valley with a third minute deflection that condemned
struggling Charlton to a fifth successive defeat.
</P>
<P>
England international Dion Dublin pulled the ball back across
the goal from the right side of the box, the ball hitting Rufus
and rebounding into the net past goalkeeper Sasa Ilic.
</P>
<P>
Charlton came close to equalising after the interval when
Villa fullback Alan Wright had to sweep hurriedly off the line,
his clearance setting up a good chance at the other end.
</P>
<P>
Ilic kept Charlton in the game in the second half with a
crucial diving block from Julian Joachim who later had the ball
in the net only to be ruled offside.
</P>
<P>
Villa goalkeeper Michael Oakes also pulled off a brilliant
save from Neil Redfearn in the 80th minute, diving instinctively
to push the goalbound ball over the bar. Seconds later Charlton's
Danny Mills hit the bar.
</P>
<P>
If the manner of victory was unexpected for a team boasting
some prolific scorers, it was in keeping with a match that was
held up at halftime by a bizarre search for a fourth official
from among the watching crowd.
</P>
<P>
The second half started 15 minutes late after the referee
pulled a hamstring and had to be replaced by the fourth man, who
had no immediate backup.
</P>
<P>
A qualified official was eventually found amongst the
spectators.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela, Mexico Hold Talks on Further Oil Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President-elect
Hugo Chavez met with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo on Monday
to discuss fresh cuts to crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
Chavez earlier had said his "urgent" talks with Zedillo would
include oil policy, after Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi Arabia met
last week in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Energy Minister Luis Tellez, who met with Chavez a week
ago in Caracas, had said after the Madrid meeting new cuts could
be implemented to reverse a 25-year low in prices.
</P>
<P>
Chavez has stated his administration, scheduled to take office
in February, would respect current oil production cuts until the
end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Mexico had earlier criticized Venezuela's alleged failure to
keep its oil commitments.
</P>
<P>
Chavez may also be lobbying with its Latin American neighbors
to obtain a rescheduling of its 23 billion U.S.-dollar debt to the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, on the other hand, was expected to adopt the same
strategy after being significantly affected by oil revenue
shortfalls in its budget.
</P>
<P>
In Madrid, the three countries reaffirmed their commitment to
the reductions agreed in June in Vienna: 725,000 barrels per day
(bpd) for Saudi Arabia, 525,000 bpd for Venezuela and 200,000 bpd
for Mexico until the end of 1999. But the action did not have a
big influence on the oil prices and new measures to prop up oil
prices are anticipated.

<HEADLINE> Italian Prosecutor Favors Limited Extradition of Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan could be extradited to Turkey for charges to which death
penalty cannot be applied, said an Italian prosecutor Monday.
</P>
<P>
Italian public prosecutor Giovanni Malerba told the Rome
Appeals Court that conditions existed to extradite the Kurdish
Worker's Party's (PKK) leader for trial on three of the charges
made in Turkey, but not for the other three because of the
possible death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor also said he was in favor of some restrictive
measure to ensure Ocalan did not flee Italy before the extradition
process was completed.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan is accused in Turkey of forming and running the outlawed
PKK, attacking the Turkish Constitution, murder, criminal

<P>
Malerba told the court that is was important that he be
extradited only for crimes committed before 1991 because,
according to Turkish law, death penalty cannot be applied for
crimes before that date.
</P>
<P>
The crimes for which the Rome prosecutor has suggested
extradition carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The Rome Appeals Court on December 16 lifted travel
restrictions on Ocalan, who was arrested in Rome on November 12.
</P>
<P>
The restrictive measures imposed on Ocalan, forbidding him from
leaving the Rome metropolitan area, had in fact been based only on
international warrant issued by Germany.
</P>
<P>
But Germany said that it will not seek to extradite Ocalan to
Germany, for fear of sparking unrest between its own Kurdish and
Turkish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Italy has refused Turkey's Extradition request because Italian
law bars extradition to countries where defendants could face
death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Admits Rape Cases in May Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Monday admitted that rapes had indeed occurred during the May
rioting, but insisted that their number was not high as had been
previously reported.
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said 52 women were
raped, 24 others were sexually assaulted, while four more victims
were sexually harassed.
</P>
<P>
He did not give the definitions for rape, sexual assault or
harassment.
</P>
<P>
"According to our investigation, there was no evidence that the
rapes were conducted in an organized way," Akbar said after
meeting with President B.J. Habibie at the Merdeka Palace here.
</P>
<P>
Habibie received Minister of Defense/Armed Forces Chief Gen.
Wiranto, Minister of Muladi and the government representatives of
the government-appointed Joint Fact-Finding Team, which was set up
by the president to investigate the riots which became a decisive
factor for president Soeharto's resignation on May 21.
</P>
<P>
"Victims of the rapes are from various ethnic groups, and are
not only ethnic Chinese as previously rumored," Akbar was quoted
by national newspapers Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the rapes took place in Jakarta, Solo, Surabaya,
Bandung, Palembang and Medan.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the rape cases took place in Jakarta and no rape
victims were killed," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would soon provide compensation and
rehabilitation for rape victims. However, he did not elaborate
further on details of the "compensation and rehabilitation."
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups have said that not less than 117 women,
mostly of Chinese ethnic origin, were raped during the riots.
Nearly 1,200 people were believed to have burned alive as they
were trapped in fires at shopping centers, offices, houses and
public places.
</P>
<P>
The Fact-Finding Team said in its report last month that 52
women, mostly Chinese-Indonesians, were raped. Fourteen of the
women were raped with violence. The team also said that 10 women
who were sexually harassed.
</P>
<P>
The team, led by Chairman of the National Commission on Human
Rights Marzuki Darusman, also found that Soeharto's son-in-law Lt.
Gen. (ret) Prabowo Subianto and former Jakarta military commander
Maj. Gen. Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin might have been involved in the
riots.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki reminded the government not to neglect the search for
those who masterminded the massive riots.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is the government's promise to fully
investigate the case and those who were involved in the riots," he
said, adding that the credibility of the Indonesian government
depended heavily on its seriousness in solving the case.

</P>
<P>
The OPEC groups Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab

CANBERRA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard intensified lingering doubts
about his commitment to reconciliation Monday, firmly rejecting an
"undue" focus on past wrongs against Aborigines and claiming that
some indigenous people would never be satisfied with the
government's approach.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 350 workers who were hired to be union-busters
during this year's waterfront dispute but later lost their jobs
filed a class action Monday seeking 125 million Australian dollars
(76.25 million U.S. dollars) damages from key figures including
the minister for workplace relations Peter Reith.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The military and political success of the fierce bombardment
of Iraq is in serious doubt as President Saddam Hussein remains
firmly in control while the United States and United Nations
policies towards him lie in tatters.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The International Monetary Funds has delivered a sharp
rebuke to western bank supervisors for allowing hedge funds and
their backers to build up highly leveraged exposures which
threatened the stability of the world financial system.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Inflation Rate Reaches 28.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will end the year
with an accumulated inflation rate of 28.4 percent, slightly below
the official forecast.
</P>
<P>
The head of the central office of statistics, Miguel Bolivar
Chollett, on Monday said inflation was below government
predictions of 30 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Chollett said the consumer price index would reach 1.6 percent
in December after hitting 1.7 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
He said unemployment averaged 11 percent in the second half of
the year, with over 1.8 million jobless workers.
</P>
<P>
Chollett said that the rate had dropped below the 11.3 percent
joblessness rate registered in the first half.
</P>
<P>
As the slide in the Venezuelan economy continues,
President-elect Hugo Chavez, who will take office on February 2,
will have to tackle a possible currency devaluation due to falling
oil prices, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
Oil is Venezuela's largest source of income and shortfalls in
crude revenues could lead to a 1.6 percent contraction of the
gross domestic product and a budget deficit of nine percent next
year, the country's second straight year of recession.

<HEADLINE> Investments Plunge 68 Percent in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The government-registered
investments in the Philippines dropped 68.6 percent in the first
11 months of 1998 from a year ago, according to data from the
Board of Investments.
</P>
<P>
Data show that investments during January-November totaled 169
billion pesos (4.225 billion U.S. dollars), a hefty 68.6 percent
drop from 539.67 billion pesos (13.491 billion dollars) posted in
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In November, the government agency says, investments plunged 88
percent to only 4.2 billion pesos (100 million dollars) from 35.78
billion pesos (894 million dollars) a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The year-to-date investment figure is 231 billion pesos (5.775
billion dollars), falling short of the 400 billion peso (10
billion dollars) target set by the agency.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in investment inflows into the country has been
attributed to the change in the administration this year, with
local and foreign investors "testing the waters" first before
committing to infuse money in a project, the agency says.

<HEADLINE> Di Canio Appeals Against Latest Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Absent Sheffield Wednesday
striker Paolo Di Canio has appealed against a fine imposed on him
by his own club.
</P>
<P>
The penalty of two week's wages was issued when Di Canio
refused to return from his native country following compassionate
leave.
</P>
<P>
The Italian had been allowed to return home to be with his
wife and new born baby daughter, but his agent said he has now
been given a doctor's note excusing his absence.
</P>
<P>
The controversial forward has now completed his 11 match ban
served by the FA pushing over referee Paul Alcock during a
Premiership match against Arsenal in September.
</P>
<P>
He is eligible to resume his career on Boxing Day, although
the club said he is unlikely to return for the match against
Leicester.
</P>
<P>
Agent Moreno Roggi said his client was suffering from stress
and depression and was unlikely to fly back until 4 January at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Roggi has revealed they have a doctor's certificate verifying
the illness, leaving Wednesday with no grounds to enforce the
suspension.
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday secretary Graham Mackrell said: "He is a
contracted employee of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and we
are entitled to expect him to work.
</P>
<P>
"There are 206 employees at this club. We don't go looking for
them when they don't turn up. We end up demeaning ourselves."
</P>
<P>
This is the third occasion the club have imposed a fine on Di
Canio, with each penalty the maximum they are allowed to impose.
</P>
<P>
It brings Di Canio's total bill for the affair, including
legal costs, to around 125,000.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday are also threatening to place Di Canio on the
transfer-list with the player still unwilling to talk to them
from his wife's home town of Terni, near Rome.
</P>
<P>
A disciplinary hearing will now be held by the FA next month,
but the Professional Footballers' Association are urging Di Canio
to end his self-imposed exile.
</P>
<P>
Deputy chief executive Brendon Batson said: "The lad has to
come back.
</P>
<P>
"He has a contract with the club and he needs to be honouring
that contract," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zidane Scoops Top Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Zinedine Zidane, who led
France to win the World Cup last summer, was voted European
footballer of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Juventus midfielder topped the poll ahead of two other
world cup stars, Croatian Davor Suker and Brazilian Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
It completed an award winning Monday for the player, who was
also voted Reuters sports personality of the year.
</P>
<P>
His two goal performance in the World Cup final was perhaps
the most significant single contribution during the entire
football year and these awards reflect that.
</P>
<P>
But Zidane's prominent role in France's success was made all
the more extraordinary because of his red card in the earlier
stages of the competition.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his international success, Zidane was also a vit
al member of the Juventus side who won the Italian Serie A title
and reached the final of the European Champions league.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Faith in Euro's Long-Term Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 21 (Xinhua) -- European business leaders
believe the euro currency eventually will overshadow the American
dollar as the world's premier reserve currency within 20 years,
according to a survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some of them, like those from Belgium, Spain and the
Netherlands, predict that the euro's dominance would happen in
just 10 years. Business leaders in the U.K. were the most
pessimistic about the euro's future, with 137 out of 259
executives surveyed doubting it would ever replace the dollar.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 business leaders from Europe's top 15,000
companies participated in the survey commissioned by the United
Parcel Service (UPS), a U.S.-based world's largest express carrier
and package delivery company.
</P>
<P>
The London-based Harris International Telephone Research Center
conducted interviewing the executives from Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K. The average
turnover of businesses interviewed is 1.57 billion U.S. dollars
and average employee size is 3,750.
</P>
<P>
UPS said in a report that it conducted the survey to gain
insight into the latest trends and leadership confidence levels in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Despite predictions of the euro's long-term success, UPS said,
only 44 percent of respondents felt the euro introduction would
benefit their companies financially over the next 12 months. In
addition, 51 percent said the euro would make "no difference" in
their companies' performance, and 5 percent believed their firms
would be "worse off" once the euro is introduced next year.
</P>
<P>
The business leaders surveyed also made predictions on the U.S.
economy and expressed views on other issues.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight of them predicted a correction for the U.S.
economy over the next 12 months. The instability of the stock
market notwithstanding, nearly one-fifth of respondents believed
the U.S. economy would improve. Germans were the most pessimistic,
with 22 percent believing that the U.S. would suffer a recession
in the next year. In comparison, only 1 percent of all the
business leaders thought the United States is heading for a
depression.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that Europe's business leaders no longer view
Asia as tomorrow's revenue center. While last year nearly a third
looked toward Asia for future growth, this has dropped
dramatically to just 6 percent this year. A booming 66 percent now
see their future growth in Western Europe, led by the Dutch, the
French and the Belgians.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the survey shows the European business leaders
united in their view of the economic crises in Asia, Brazil and
Russia, with the majority of all countries unconcerned about the
impact on European affairs. A total of 78 percent said Brazil's
economic problems would have little or no effect on their
businesses, while 70 percent said the same for Russia and 59
percent for Asia.
</P>
<P>
Global economics ranked highest among six criteria affecting
corporate performance in all countries surveyed, followed by
national political climate, interest rates, EU regulations and the
introduction of the euro. In four of the seven countries surveyed,
more than 50 percent considered global economics the most
influential factor led by Belgium at 64 percent. Germany and the
U.K., while rating global conditions highest, are the least
globally inclined.

with 161 votes for and 135 votes against.

The cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Costas Simitis, had
approved the budget in November, which aims to help the Greek
government to lower the country's inflation and to join the euro
zone in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said before concluding the debate that Greece was
converging with the other European Union countries with its worth.
</P>
<P>
He added that the more the course of the Greek economy
improved, the more the Greek people would be given the price of
their toil.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Oil Exports Continue Despite U.S.-British Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi oil exports continued
normally despite four days of bombing by the United States and
Britain, according to a weekly report released by the United
Nations Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the week ending Friday, December 18, Iraq shipped 11.14
million barrels of oil under the oil-for-food program, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The export pace of an average of 1.59 million barrels per day
is about normal in comparison with the previous week's 1.7 million
bpd, a U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
A portion of a refinery in Basra was bombed, but it is not
expected to affect the oil-for-food program, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Iraq to sell up to 5.256 billion U.S.
dollars of crude oil over six months from November 25 for the
purchase of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
The program, begun in December 1996, is aimed at alleviating
the suffering of the Iraqi people under U.N. sanctions imposed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) Monday announced it has approved a record
10 billion U.S. dollars in loans for Latin America and the
Caribbean during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, disbursements to the region also reached a record
6.48 billion dollars during the year.

IDB President Enrique V. Iglesias noted in his annual year-end

emergency lending, the largest sector of Bank financing remains
focused on poverty reduction. "The Bank continues to give priority
for programs in the social area," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the IDB had invested heavily in 1998 in
providing relief and assisting reconstruction in those countries
suffering from natural disasters, such as Hurricane Mitch and the
El Nino climate disruption, while continuing to emphasize programs
for reform of the state and improved public management, national
and international peace processes, microenterprise and small
business, regional integration, and gender and ethnic equity.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Job Rating up after Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's approval ratings have gone up since his impeachment, and
the number of Americans who want him to leave office has gone
down, according to polls released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Three new polls were conducted on Saturday and Sunday after the
impeachment vote in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
New polls by ABC News/Washington Post, CBS News/New York Times
and CNN/USA Today/Gallup mirrored other polls released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The CBS/Times poll showed Clinton's approval rating at 73
percent after becoming the first president impeached in 130 years,
compared to 68 percent before the vote.
</P>
<P>
The ABC/Post poll had him at 67 percent up from 64 and the
CNN/USA Today poll had 73 percent, up a full 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who believe Clinton should remain in
office and not resign or be removed by the Senate has gone up.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of those responding to the CBS/Times poll said
Clinton should remain in office as 31 percent said he should
resign.
</P>
<P>
In the ABC/Post poll, the number of those who said the Senate
should remove him from office went from 39 percent for and 59
against on December 15 to 33 percent for and 66 against on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In responses to the CNN/USA Today poll 68 percent wanted their
senators to vote against conviction while 29 percent wanted them to
vote for, a change of five percentage points in Clinton's favor in
four days.
</P>
<P>
The same poll showed Republican approval dropped drastically.
On December 15-16, Republicans had a favorable rating of 43
percent to 47 percent disapproval, but this weekend that changed
to 31 percent favorable to 57 percent disapproval.
</P>
<P>
Testing suggestions that Americans have not been paying close
attention to the impeachment process, the ABC/Post poll said 82
percent of the people were following the proceedings either "very"
or "somewhat" closely.
</P>
<P>
The ABC/Post poll was conducted among 1,285 adults with a
margin of error of three percentage points, the CBS/Times among
1,341 adults with the same margin of error and the CNN/USA Today
was with 852 adults with a margin of error of four percentage
points.

NEW YORK, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on Wall Street
rose Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 85.22 to

</P>
<P>
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose a staggering
51.89 points to a record of 2,138.03, breaking Friday's record.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 14.81 to 1,202.84, also a record
high.
</P>
<P>
Computer and other technology stocks, such as Dow component IBM
and Nasdaq's Dell, pushed major market indicators up.
</P>
<P>
Investors have been psychologically prepared for events such as
the impeachment of President Clinton in the House and U.S.-British
military strikes against Iraq so that these events little affected
the market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Market players did not hold a wait and see attitude toward
Tuesday's decision-making Fed meeting as they do not see the
possibility of a further interest cut as imminent when the
economic situation is stable and there is no urgent need to
stimulate the market through such a move.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Pakistan Settle F-16 Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States will pay
Pakistan 326.9 million dollars in cash and up to 140 million
dollars in other compensation to settle an eight-year dispute over
F-16 aircraft that Islamabad paid for but never received, the
White House said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan would receive 324.6 million dollars in cash from the
U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund and a further 2.3 million dollars
from the U.S. Department of Defense as part of the deal reached by
President Bill Clinton and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
As part of the 140 million dollars in other compensation, the
United States will give Pakistan white wheat valued at about 60
million dollars at prevailing market prices during the current
U.S. fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1. The other 80 million
dollars in compensation will be negotiated by Washington and
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement between Clinton and Sharif, the United
States said Pakistan had agreed to renounce its 463.7 million
dollar claim against the United States for the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, bought to bolster Pakistan's defenses, were
denied to Pakistan by the U.S. Pressler Amendment which barred
military sales to countries with nuclear programs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Announces Trade Sanctions on Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
announced it will slap hundreds of millions of dollars of punitive
tariffs on products from the European Union, escalating a banana
trade war between the two.
</P>
<P>
The products covered by the punishment range from sheep's milk
cheese to cashmere sweaters, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky announced.
</P>
<P>
The United States was exercising its rights under the World
Trade Organization (WTO) to impose penalties on the 15-nation
Europe Union for, in the U.S. view, unfairly blocking U.S.
companies from selling bananas from Latin America to Europe, said
Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
The penalties, 100 percent tariffs, will effectively double the
price to American consumers of targeted items.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions could go into effect as soon as Feburary. 2, or as
late as March 3, depending on whether the European Union elects to
arbitrate the content of the list.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky said the sanctions list was announced after six
years of failed attempts to get Europe to comply with rulings by
the WTO and its the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
</P>
<P>
The tariffs, she said, are intended to offset "the damage
caused by the EU''s discriminatory banana regime."
</P>
<P>
She said "Our door remains open to a negotiated solution" but
as recently as Friday a meeting between Sir Leon Brittan, the
European Union's trade commissioner, and President Clinton and
other administration officials failed to produce an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Among the items targeted for 100 percent tariffs are: Pecorino
cheese made from sheep's milk, sweet biscuits, bath salts,
candles, handbags, felt paper, folding cartons, greeting cards,
lithographs, cashmere sweaters, cotton bed linen, batteries for
electric vehicles, coffee and tea makers and chandeliers.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Opposition's No-Confidence Motion Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian parliament
Monday evening voted 283-163 to reject the no-confidence motion
put forward by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motion was the first since the new parliament
was formed at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The motion, read out last Wednesday in parliament, was signed
by 97 deputies and 46 senators from the parliamentary groups of
the Party of Social Democracy of Romania (main opposition), the
Greater Romanian Party, and the Romanian National Unity Party.
</P>
<P>
The motion said that Romania is today in the grip of the most
serious social crisis after 1989, referring to "the incapacity of
the current majority to lead the country as well to its incapacity
to understand and defend the national interest."
</P>
<P>
The authors of the no-confidence motion considered that the
government led by Radu Vasile demonstrated in the eight months
since it took office the lack of responsibility for the economic
and social situation in the country."
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Party of Social Democracy Ion Iliescu explained
that the motion was determined by the country's arrested economic
and social development, not political calculations.
</P>
<P>
He said the motion had been meant to "trigger out" serious
public debates on the effects of the current leading coalition's
mistakes and the ways to put an end to the current "dangerous
fall" of economy and living standards, and also to reinvigorate
the country's economy and society.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Lose Radio Contact With NEAR Spacecraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from the Johns
Hopkins University lost radio contact with a spacecraft trying to
orbit asteroid Eros some 240 millions miles from Earth.
</P>
<P>
Contact was lost about 5 p.m. EST Sunday when scientists at the
university's Applied Physics Laboratory tried to adjust the speed
of the spacecraft so as to lower its speed to enter Eros's orbit,
said spokeswoman Helen Worth Monday.
</P>
<P>
She said that contact was lost during an 18-minute procedure to
fire the main engine of the spacecraft to lower its speed.
Scientists suspect that this procedure was not successful.
</P>
<P>
NEAR was launched into space in 1996 and scientists want it to
circle the asteroid to gather information on Eros and test ways to
save the Earth from killer asteroids.
</P>
<P>
The giant and fast-moving asteroid is 25 mile long. The
spacecraft would orbit and if possible even land on the surface of
the asteroid in 1999 to spend one year to probe its chemistry,
mineral content, mass and density.

Clinton threatened on Monday to seek tighter sanctions against
Libya if it did not turn over two suspects involved in the 1988
Pan Am bombing for trial in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"This is a take it or leave it offer," Clinton said during an
Arlington Cemetery ceremony to remember the 270 lives lost in
the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We will not negotiate its terms. If the suspects are
convicted, they will serve their time in Scotland. And if the
suspects are not turned over by the time of the next sanctions
review we will work at the United Nations with our allies and
friends to seek yet stronger measures against Libya," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain in August dropped their
insistence that the Lockerbie suspects be extradited to either of
their countries. They challenged Libya to make good on an offer to
try the suspects in a third country with Scottish law and under a
Scottish court.
</P>
<P>
So far the two suspects, Abdel Basset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi
and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, have not been handed over.
</P>
<P>
Clinton hoped that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi might accept
the deal.
</P>
<P>
"That would be the best outcome, for it would mean that
finally there would be a trial," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi earlier said he preferred to set up an international
court with judges from the United States, Britain, Libya and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said if the U.S.-British proposal to try the suspects
in the netherlands fails, Gaddafi will have to bear the
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British envoys told the U.N. Security Council on
Monday that their patience was running out. The Security Council
is scheduled to review sanctions against Libya on February 26.
</P>
<P>
The current sanctions, first enacted in 1992 and reviewed
every 120 days, include a ban on air travel, an arms embargo and
a reduction in the level of diplomatic ties with Libya.
</P>
<P>
They were toughened in 1993 with a freeze on some Libyan
assets abroad and a ban on certain types of equipment used in oil
terminals and at refineries. But there is no embargo on Libya's
oil exports.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Hit New Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices slumped to new lows
on Monday after Iraq's exports survived a four-day military
attacks against Baghdad without disruption.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark North Sea Brent was last traded at $9.76, down 23
cents after crashing to a new 12-year trough of $9.55, five cents
below the previous floor set on December 10.
</P>
<P>
Prices have not been lower since cash Brent slumped below $9 in
the Summer of 1986. Average prices this year are already lower
than in 1986 with Brent running at just $13.42, its cheapest since
1976.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries producer
cartel would have to cut output further to have any chance of a
price rise in 1999, according to the Center for Global Energy
Studies (CGES).
</P>
<P>
"If OPEC wants higher oil prices it must cut production to
achieve them. Protracted delays as we saw in 1998 will only make
the situation worse," the Center said in a monthly report.
</P>
<P>
Western industry officials said four days of air strikes aimed
mainly at Iraqi military targets seemed to have had little direct
impact on the Arab country's export facilities.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi exports were running normally on Monday, said an industry
official familiar with monitoring under a U.N. oil-for-food sales
program said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq loadings are normal, while on the political side support
for the U.S. and U.K. positions on Iraq is melting away, and that
could point to renewed pressure for a lifting of sanctions,"
Christoper Bellew of Prudential Bache International in London was
quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraq recently has reportedly pumped about 2.5 million barrels a
day of crude, exporting 1.8 million bpd under the U.N.
humanitarian exchange and refining the remainder.
</P>
<P>
The CGES said global demand was expected to have risen only
400,000 bpd in 1998, a mere fifth of 1997's figure.
</P>
<P>
"To cap this dismal news, so far the Winter in the northern
hemisphere has been relatively mild," it said.
</P>
<P>
Prices slumped by more than $1 as a meeting in Madrid last week
between Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico, the architects of two
rounds of oil production cuts this year to shore up prices, ended
without commitments to cut more output.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Votes for Early Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament)
 Monday passed a bill in the first reading, which calls for
dissolution of Knesset and early elections.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed by a vote of 80 in favor, 30 against and
four abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Just before the vote, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu made the last efforts to save his government by calling
the opposition Labor Party to join a national unity government.
</P>
<P>
But Labor leader Ehud Barak rejected the offer, saying that
it was too late in the current situation.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel's basic law, the bill will become
legislation after another two readings.
</P>
<P>
However, since most of Knesset members have expressed their
support for the bill, it was almost inevitable that early
elections would be held within six months.
</P>
<P>
The Labor reportedly hoped elections will take place in next
March, while the ruling Likud Party wanted elections in late
April. And the two parties will consult to reach a final date.
</P>
<P>
Besides the two leading party chiefs, another possible
candidate for premiership is the General Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who
is a popular figure in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Shahak, former Chief of General Staff, is expected to
formally leave the army following Monday's voting and prepare
for the elections.
</P>
<P>
Barak has asked Shahak to be his deputy in the Labor
Party, but Shahak refused and planed to head a centrist party.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest poll in the local media, Barak
may be out of race after the first round of elections. And
only Shahak will compete with Netanyahu for the post of prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has expressed his confidence that he will win in
the elections. During the Knesset plenum, he said that he will
get public mandate for his policy in the peace talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Since Netanyahu came to power in June, 1996, the peace process
has been stalled for most of the time in the last two years. And
the opposition left-wing parties accused Netanyahu of dragging
foot in living up to the promises under the Oslo agreement.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the right-wing parties in the coalition
were angry at Netanyahu after he signed a new peace agreement with
the Palestinian on October 23.
</P>
<P>
The protest from both the coalition and the opposition forced
Netanyahu to accept the end of his government. And Netanyahu also
voted for the bill on Monday for early elections, hoping that he
could set up a more stable government next year.

<HEADLINE> Last Range of Ceausescu's Alcoholic Drinks Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The last range of Romanian
former president Nicolae Ceausescu's alcoholic drinks was sold by
auction in Bucharest on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The drinks were put out to tender at the Bucur S.A. company's
headoffice, with an opening sale price of 35 million lei (3,300
U.S. dollars), and were sold at last at 150 million lei (14,300
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,150 bottles of wine, spirit, cherry brandy and
champaign were left after the Bucur S.A. company had organized
five bids, putting on sale drinks raised in 1990 from Ceausescu's
Bucharest residence, at the request of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The oldest wine to be put out to tender was produced in 1918.
Some of the drinks come from former CMEA (the Council of Mutual
Economic Assistance) states or north-African countries, a gift
Ceausescu received from his counterparts, while the others are
domestic ones, part of which were produced in the very cellars of
his villa.
</P>
<P>
Money raised during the auction will be donated to orphanages
and nursing homes.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Dialogue Should Prevail in Solving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The 10th anniversary of
the 1988 Lockerbie bombing came Monday, seeing no suspects have
been handed over to the trial before a Scottish court in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the Libyan and the U.K.-U.S. demands remain
wide and the two sides showed no signs for compromise Monday
despite their previous agreements on where to try the two
suspects.
</P>
<P>
However, the world does not lose hope for a positive response
from the Libyan government. The mood was mirrored by Kofi Annan,
who told reporters Monday morning that he is "regrettable, but
still hopeful."
</P>
<P>
"My message to them is that it is regrettable that 10 years
after the event, we have not been able to get to the truth so that
they can put this behind them, mourn their dead and carry on their
lives. But I am still hopeful that we will still get a positive
decision from the Libyan government," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"I had hoped it would come before this date -- the anniversary
-- but I have not lost hope. And they (families of victims) should
not" either, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
But the talks have not yet taken place between the Libyan legal
team and the U.N. legal experts despite Tripoli announced that it
would send a legal team to New York for talks with U.N. experts on
the trial of the two suspects of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, which
killed 270 people after a Pan Am airliner exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London have accused the two Libyans, namely
Lameen Fhaima and Abdel-Basit Al-Megarhi, of masterminding the
bombing 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva told a press
conference Monday, "There was a meeting of the Libyan (General)
People's Congress, and the Libyans have their own mechanisms for
decision-making. And we have to wait on that."
</P>
<P>
Annan, who met with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on December
5, failed to get the two suspects extradited for a trial before
the Scottish court in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In August, Tripoli accepted a Washington-London proposal to try
the two under the Scottish law in a neutral country, and this was
seen as a big step forward in efforts to solve the long-standing
issue.
</P>
<P>
At issue is the dispute over where the two suspects, if
convicted, are to serve their sentences. Libya has been demanding
that if the two Libyans are found guilty, they should serve their
sentences in the Netherlands, not in Scotland as Britain and the
United States insist.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, both Britain and the United States warned Libya that
they could take additional measures if it failed by next February
to hand over the two suspects in the case for trial.
</P>
<P>
In his statement during the closed-door Security Council
consultations, Peter Burleigh, charge d'affaires of the U.S.
Mission to the United Nations, said, "We are running out our
patience."
</P>
<P>
"In February, the Security Council will hold its regularly
scheduled review of Libya sanctions," he said. "If by that time,
the government of Libya has not handed over the suspects for trial
before a Scottish court in the Netherlands, we will seek
additional measures to compel compliance."
</P>
<P>
In echoing Burleigh's remarks, Jeremy Greenstock, British
permanent representative to the United Nations, said, "Our
patience is not unlimited. We will ask the Council to look again
at this issue, when it next reviews the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the U.S. concept of "additional
measures" includes a demand for the Security Council to further
tighten its sanctions against Libya, which have already been made
harder on the country under relevant U.N. resolutions adopted in
1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
The warning came as progress has been made around the Lockerbie
issue thanks to the Libyan flexibility and the fruitful mediating
efforts by the Arab League and the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Practice has proved that only by peaceful efforts, mutual
respect and mutual cooperation are the only effective way to solve
international disputes, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that the world is opposed to terrorism in
any form and terrorists should be brought to justice. But the
sanctions do not lead to proper solution to the lengthy problem,
but simply worsen the humanitarian situation in Libya.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged sanctions against Libya have brought untold
sufferings to the Libyan people, especially women and children,
undermined the development of the country, and at the same time
affected the economic growth of third countries.
</P>
<P>
The positive developments around the Lockerbie case should be
helpful for the Security Council to make a decision on an early
lifting of the sanctions against the North African country.
</P>
<P>
Libya has made it clear that Washington and London should not
use the 10th anniversary as a tool of pressure, and the problem
should be solved through dialogue and negotiations. Such a
statement should not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that all parties concerned can, in the spirit of
consultation and cooperation, reach an agreement on the specific
points in the case, thus kicking off the trial process at an early
date.
