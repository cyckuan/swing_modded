<HEADLINE> EU-ASEAN Cooperation Pact to Cover Laos, Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
proposed to include Laos and Cambodia in a cooperation agreement
signed in 1980 by the European Community (EC) and the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the European Commission said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Commission, the EU's executive branch, has just adopted
proposals for decisions to conclude protocols extending the EC-
ASEAN Cooperation Agreement to the Lao People's Democratic
Republic and to the Kingdom of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The decisions will be approved by the EU Council of Ministers,
the EU's policy-making body. The Commission said it is expected
that the Council will clear the protocols, so that they can be
signed at the end of this month during the ASEAN Post-Ministerial
Conference in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
These Protocols will allow the two Asian countries to benefit
from the European Community economic cooperation projects and
programs provided under the regional cooperation agreement with
ASEAN, and to strengthen their dialogue with the European
Community, which is now still the part of the EU as an economic
pillar.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten said he
welcomed the conclusion of the concerned negotiations, as a
further sign of the durability of the EU-ASEAN partnership -- one
of the EU's longest-standing relationships.
</P>
<P>
"It is all the more welcome since Laos will, on August 1, take
over the coordination of relations between the EU and ASEAN. I
look forward to attending the EU-ASEAN Ministerial Meeting later
this year in Vientiane, Laos," Patten said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
The extension follows the accession of the two countries to
ASEAN on July 23, 1997 and April 30 of last year, respectively. It
came in response to a request by ASEAN member countries, the EU
executive Commission said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Panel Urges to Prevent Rwanda-like Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A panel formed by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Friday called on the international community
to take serious measures to prevent the repeat of the 1994
genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by former Botswanan president Ketumile
Masire, who chaired the OAU panel investigating the 1994 Rwanda
genocide, when he presented a report to the OAU Secretary-General
on his investigation.
</P>
<P>
In the report entitled "Rwanda, The Preventable Genocide", the
panel accused the United Nations Security Council, influenced by
the United States, France and Belgium, of failing to prevent the
genocide from taking place.
</P>
<P>
It urged all those parties that have apologized for their role
in the genocide and those who have yet to apologize to support the
Secretary- General of the United Nations to establish a commission
to set a formula for reparations for the genocide victims and to
identify which countries have an obligation to pay them.
</P>
<P>
"The funds paid as reparations should be devoted to urgently
needed infrastructure developments and social service improvements
on behalf of all Rwandans," it said.
</P>
<P>
The panel also urged the present government of Rwanda to
acknowledge that it is unrealistic to pretend that ethnicity is no
longer a political factor in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We urge all Rwandans, both in government and civil society, to
work together to forge a untied society based on the inherent
strength and rich heritage of Rwanda's diverse ethnic
communities," the panel said in its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
It also called on all countries either to extradite accused
genocide leaders they are harboring or to try them in exile to
bring all leaders of the genocide to trial with the utmost speed.
</P>
<P>
The International Panel of Eminent Personalities to Investigate
the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda and the Surrounding Events was created
in 1998 by OAU with a mandate to investigate the 1994 genocide in
Rwanda and the surrounding events in the Great Lakes Region as
part of the efforts aimed at averting and preventing further
wide-scale conflicts in the region.

<HEADLINE> Bio-control Method to Save Date Palm Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The scientists of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) have developed the world's first environment-
friendly bio-technology to save date palm trees from red weevils.
</P>
<P>
The project was carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries in cooperation with the Arab Organization for Agriculture
Development (AOAD), the official WAM news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The research on "bio-control of red palm weevil" was conducted
at the Agricultural Research Station at Al Hamraniya in Ras al
Khaimah, said WAM.
</P>
<P>
UAE scientists are now able to resort to three locally-developed
bio-techniques to eradicate the red weevil menace and save millions
of hectares of date palm trees in the Gulf states, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The method can initially cut down and later replace the use of
pesticides which are harmful to public life and the environment.
</P>
<P>
It was developed after two and a half years of research under a
project spearheaded by the AOAD and the Arab League, in
collaboration with the Ministries of Agriculture in the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
The project, which has two main research centers in UAE's Ras Al
Khaimah and in Qatif of Saudi Arabia, was funded by the Jeddah-
based Islamic Development Bank and the International Fund for
Agricultural Development, a U.N. body, said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday urged Congress to reject election-year maneuvering and
appeals of "reckless special interests" and pass his prescription
drug plan for older Americans.
</P>
<P>
"I call on Congress to reject that approach and the reckless
campaign of special interests and act together in the public
interest," Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Republicans' alternative as "a plan designed for
those who make the drugs, not for the seniors who need to take
them," Clinton said the effort to pass a prescription-benefit
plan has bogged down in Congress because of a "shameless, scorched-
earth campaign."
</P>
<P>
He said that the drug industry has spent 236 million dollars on
its lobbying efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We need a prescription drug benefit that works for seniors and
people with disabilities, not just for the pharmaceutical industry,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Prescription drug is likely to be a priority for older voters
in this year's elections. Clinton hopes to establish a standard,
government-run Medicare benefit while the Republican lawmakers
push for extending drug coverage through government-subsidized
policies.

<HEADLINE> Poor Customer Service Costs U.S. E-Tailers Big Bucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 8 (Xinhua) -- American Internet retailers
lost about 6.1 billion U.S. dollars in online sales last year by
failing to provide sufficient customer service, a new industry
study said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report from global market analysis firm Datamonitor
estimated that for every complete online transaction nearly four
times as many are abandoned because of poor online service, and 7.
8 percent of these abandoned transactions could have been salvaged
and converted to sales.
</P>
<P>
If this trend continues, Datamonitor forecast a cumulative loss
of more than 173 billion dollars in potentially salvageable sales
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"The average company could have improved its online sales
figures by almost 35 percent last year if it had provided better
online customer service for potential customers," the report said.
"This will be particularly important for new dot.com companies who
are now realizing that they have to produce a profit, and soon."
</P>
<P>
The study also predicted that revenues from the sale of e-
service software and services will increase by more than 1,100
percent between now and 2004. The market will grow from 162
million dollars at the end of 1999 to 1.95 billion dollars by 2004.
</P>
<P>
According to Datamonitor, the successful U.S. e-service
companies provide solutions that help Web sites supply the right
customer service, at the right time, through the right channels.
One essential part of the e-service mix is e-mail management.
Other components include Web-based self-help, collaborative
browsing, text chat and voice-over Internet protocol.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Protestants Call for Peaceful Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The pro-British Protestant Orangeman
in the Northern Ireland city of Portadown Saturday called for a
four-hour peaceful demonstration across Northern Ireland on Monday
in support of the Drumcree protest.
</P>
<P>
They confirmed their protest at Portadown would continue until
their civil and religious liberties were restored.
</P>
<P>
Far from downgrading the demonstration, they called in a
statement for further protests against the Parades Commission.
</P>
<P>
They called on unionist MPs at Westminster who are members of
the Orange Order to "disrupt parliamentary business as an ongoing
protest, and to push hard for the Government to disband the
Parades Commission forthwith".
</P>
<P>
They urged all members of the Order in the Northern Ireland
Assembly "to withdraw from Stormont until Orange rights are fully
restored".
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson issued a fresh call
the same day for Drumcree protests to cease and condemned those
involved as "a rabble".
</P>
<P>
Mandelson also expressed disappointment that the leader of
Portadown Orangemen, Harold Gracey, had refused to condemn
violence which has dominated the protest at the banning of Sunday'
s Orange Order parade
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble added his voice
to the call for calm.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Saturday also appealed
directly to a leading member of Northern Ireland's Protestant
Orange Order to do "everything possible to avoid tension and
violence" during weekend marches.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Nigel Dawson, a leader of the Portadown Orange
Order which is due to march in Drumcree on Sunday, Blair said he
recognized Orangemen would be disappointed by a ban on their
parade passing through Catholic areas.
</P>
<P>
A week of violent rioting followed the ban by the Parades
Commission on the Order marching from Portadown's neighboring
hamlet of Drumcree along the Garvaghy Road, which is dominated by
Catholic Irish nationalists.
</P>
<P>
British army engineers spent Saturday stiffening defenses of
razor wire and metal barriers to try and block marchers and
demonstrators from entering the Garvaghy Road enclave in the
Protestant stronghold of Portadown.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Not Ready for Zero Tariff Within EAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
said it will continue its protectionism stance against zero import
tariffs as embraced by other East African Community member states
until a time when its economy grows to such a degree that it can
compete fairly with Uganda and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here Saturday with the visiting delegation of 25
East African parliamentarians, Tanzanian Minister for Industries
and Commerce Iddi Simba said Tanzania is still in its infancy as
far as industrial goods are concerned and that it can not stand at
equal footing in business arena with the other two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"We have to protect our economy. We know how lucrative our
market is to the outside world," said the minister, adding: "If
we open the doors just like that, we would still be mere
consumers of outside goods without ourselves selling our goods."
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Uganda parliamentarians had wanted to know why
Tanzania was not heeding to the call of zero import tariffs
within the East African Community.
</P>
<P>
"Allowing the foreign goods to enter the country at will would
be tragedy to our fledgling economy," Simba added.
</P>
<P>
The East African Community Treaty, which was signed by
presidents of the three countries in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha last November, is aimed at gradually forging the bloc into
a monetary union and later a political federation.
</P>
<P>
The bloc provides for gradual withdrawal of both the internal
and external tariffs by member states within a duration of four
years after the signing.
</P>
<P>
During the four years, in order to develop internal capacity,
Tanzanian officials have said the country will have to improve
the infrastructure, increase workers productivity and also lower
the costs of electricity, water, telephone and transportation.

<HEADLINE> East African Community Treaty Comes into Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The treaty for the
establishment of the new East African Community (EAC) came into
effect on Friday after Tanzania deposited instruments of
ratification with the Community's Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation deposited the instruments to Muthaura in Dar es
Salaam on Friday. Kenya and Uganda have already done so in
Tanzania's northern town of Arusha, where the EAC secretariat is
based.
</P>
<P>
To witness the ceremony were speakers of the Houses of the
three partner states as well as Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous
region of Tanzania, who were in the one-day East African
Cooperation meeting of speakers of the national assemblies, local
press reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The official inauguration of the EAC by the three Heads of
States will be on November 30, said Muthaura.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rules of procedure for the EAC legislative
assembly indicated a further deepening of the East African
integration.
</P>
<P>
With the community's coming into force, said Muthaura, the role
of parliamentarians will be to promote cooperation among the
national assemblies and their link with the Community's
Legislative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In this regard the Joint Committee of National Assemblies will
also be expected to promote programs for strengthening and
consolidating the partner states' political, economic and social
cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The old East African Community collapsed in 1977, partly
because of a divergence of economic policies among the three
member countries.
</P>
<P>
The new East African Community Treaty, which was signed by
presidents of the three countries in Arusha last November, is
aimed at gradually forging the block into a monetary union and
later a political federation.
</P>
<P>
The block is expected to have key organs such as legislative
assembly, community court, sector units and the heads of state
summit.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's National Carrier to Resume Flights to Libya Next Thursday </HEADLINE>

<P>
CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's national carrier will resume
flights to Libya on Thursday, more than one year after the air
embargo imposed against Libya in 1992 by the United Nations
Security Council was suspended, a senior official of the company
said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir will have three flights each week from Cairo to Libya,
two to Tripoli and one to the Mediterranean city of Benghazi,
EgyptAir Stations General Manager Samir Imbabi said.
</P>
<P>
The first plane will carry an EgyptAir delegation to discuss
technical issues with the Libyan side, Imbabi added.
</P>
<P>
Libya's first plane in eight years landed at Cairo International
Airport early Saturday, carrying 11 passengers and a delegation of
Libyan civil aviation officials.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Issa, a top official of the Libyan Arab Airlines (LAA),
said upon arrival that LAA will make 12 return flights a week
between the two countries including seven linking Tripoli and
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Two flights will link the Mediterranean cities of Benghazi in
Libya and Alexandria in Egypt in addition to two weekly flights
between Benghazi and Cairo and one between Cairo and Sabha, 600
kilometers south of Tripoli, Issa added.
</P>
<P>
The international air embargo was suspended more than a year ago
following the handover of two Libyans suspected of the 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
Officials on both sides have said the resumption of regular
flights has been delayed due to technical and commercial reasons.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on China-U.S. Arms Control Consultation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States ended
two days of consultation on arms control and anti-proliferation
here today, during which they had a "comprehensive, in-depth and
frank" exchange of views on a number of related issues, Foreign
Ministry Spokesperson Sun Yuxi said this evening.
</P>
<P>
This remark followed the consultation between Chinese Vice-
Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Guangya and the U.S. special
adviser to the president and under secretary of state for arms
control and international security affairs, John Holum.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that both sides believed that the two countries have
had good cooperation, and made important progress in the areas of
arms control and anti-proliferation in the past ten years,
especially during the Clinton administration, thus playing a
positive role in maintaining international and regional peace and
security, as well as promoting the development of Sino-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side comprehensively expounded its stance on the U.
S. missile defense program, stressing the importance and necessity
of safeguarding and strictly observing the Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) treaty, and expressing serious concerns about the negative
impact exerted by the U.S. development of the National Missile
Defense (NMD) program and the U.S.-Japanese joint research and
development of the Theater Missile Defense (TMD), Sun said, adding
that China has again voiced its firm opposition to arms sales to
Taiwan by any country, including providing Taiwan with TMD-related
assistance and a TMD shield.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the two countries have a number of
common stances and interests in the areas of arms control and anti-
proliferation, and at the same time some disagreement; and the
consultations were constructive and promoted mutual understanding,
Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that they would persist with such
consultations on the basis of equality, mutual trust and
considering each other's concerns, he said.
</P>

During Holum's stay in Beijing, Liu Huaqiu, minister in charge
of the Central Foreign Affairs Office, Xiong Guangkai, deputy

TEHRAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Saturday called on the United States to change its hostile
policies toward Iran and follow the example of European countries
in developing relations with the Islamic country.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that expansion of relations with European countries
will lead to a revision of the U.S. policies toward Iran," Kharrazi
was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the appeal while speaking to the German daily "
Frankfurter Allgemeine" on the possible effect of President
Mohammad Khatami's upcoming visit to Berlin next week on the long-
strained Iran-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran's expanding ties with Germany and other European countries
will enhance awareness in the U.S. that it has no other choice but
to expand ties with Iran, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that without modifying its hostile
policies toward Iran, the U.S. is in fact ostracizing the American
companies from doing business with Tehran through sanctions.
</P>
<P>
On the Iranian-German ties, Kharrazi expressed hope that
President Khatami's visit to Berlin on July 10-12 will herald new
horizons in political, cultural and economic cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran is interested in developing better ties with the European
Union (EU), so naturally it would like to have good relations with
all important EU members, including Germany, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that other EU countries such as France and Italy were
ahead of Germany in expanding ties with Iran, so Berlin would take
steps to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
On a German court ruling in 1997 that led to tension between the
two traditionally close trade partners, Kharrazi said Iran and
Germany should look to the future in developing their relations and
not be tied to the past.
</P>
<P>
The ruling accused the Iranian government of involvement in the
1992 assassination of Iranian dissidents in a Berlin restaurant.
Iran, in retaliation, arrested a German businessman in Tehran who
was accused of having illegal sex relations with an Iranian woman.
</P>
<P>
Khatami visited Italy and France last year, and German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer visited Iran in March to discuss a trip by
Khatami to Germany.

<HEADLINE> Iran Refutes Report on Iraqi Oil Smuggled through Iranian Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday denied a recent
report that Iraq has smuggled oil in violation of the U.N.
sanctions imposed on it through Iran's Kish island in the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the Kish Free Trade Zone said the report by the
Los Angeles Times was "unfounded allegation" against Iran, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Security officers on the island had intercepted a single tanker
smuggling Iraqi oil on March 29 and referred the matter to the
justice department, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
He said an investigation into the oil smuggling case is still
underway.
</P>
<P>
Kish island officials have provided a videotape and 15 photos of
the tanker which violated Iranian territorial waters, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also complained that rumor mongering is routine
for western media. For example, he said, Kish island has bought two
dolphins for a tourist site on the island and they reported that
Iran has bought the dolphins for spying.
</P>
<P>
He underlined Kish island officials, who are committed to
protecting the island's environment, will never allow Iraqi tankers
to spoil the environment of the tourist island.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, under the U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, has to sell oil under a U.N. supervision system, but
smugglers tend to ship oil from the country for huge money.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)
claimed to have intercepted 12 oil tankers smuggling oil from Iraq
in April for violating Iranian territorial waters.

<P>
CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court on Saturday handed
down a six-month suspended imprisonment sentence to Ali Salaheddin
Mohsen, a writer accused of defaming Islam by publishing a book
describing Islam's holy book the Koran as the "holy book of Bedouin
ignorance."
</P>
<P>
Mohsen, 43, was found guilty of using his book to spread
extremist ideas with the aim of scorning and disdaining Islam,
Judge Hosam al-Diab told the Giza state security misdemeanors
court, the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The trial began on June 17 after Mohsen was arrested in March at
his home in the Sixth of October town near Cairo after he published
the book "The Shivering of the Lights."
</P>
<P>
He has also been accused of insulting the Prophet Mohammed and
blaming Islam for Arab countries' underdevelopment. Police found
several banned publications at his home.
</P>
<P>
Muslims believe the Koran, as revealed to Mohammed, is the
direct and unalterable word of God.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Intensify Anti-Drug Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish anti-drug forces have
launched "determined and successful" struggle against illicit drugs
trafficking at three major drug routes through the country, said
Turkish police authorities in a written statement issued on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued amid some newspapers' accusations that
the police failed to conduct efficient anti-drug operations,
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the Directorate General of Security summed up
its latest operations and dismissed the reports as "unrealistic and
baseless," Anatolia said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, a total of 6,121 people involved in drug trafficking
were arrested in 2,587 separate operations, while anti-drug forces
seized 2,249 kilograms of heroin, 5,458 kilograms of hashish, 288
kilograms of base morphine, 13 kilograms of cocaine, 26.2 tons of
acid anhydride and 1,749,305 captogan pills, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the forces have captured 3,219 suspects in 1,
458 operations, and snatched 2,850 kilograms of heroin, 22.6 tons
of hashish, 976 kilograms of base morphine, 56 kilograms of opium,
6 kilograms of cocaine, 5.5 tons of acid anhydride, 618,336
captogan pills and 14,964 synthetic drugs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1,583 kilograms of heroin, 50 kilograms of cocaine,
15.5 kilograms of opium and 8.3 tons of acid anhydride were
confiscated in joint operations with the U.S., German, British,
Romanian, Belgian, Russian, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and Greek anti-
narcotics units, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a commercial and cultural bridge between Europe and
Asia because of its geographical position. Nearly 70 percent of
illicit drugs produced in the rest of the world is smuggled to
European countries via Turkey, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has launched global cooperations and forceful struggle
against illicit drugs trafficking in three fronts via the country,
the northern Black Sea route, Balkan route and eastern
Mediterranean route, it said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's efforts and determination to fight drug trafficking
have been praised by the European Union, the U.S. and the United
Nations, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. held a seminar on anti-drug trafficking and organized
crimes in Ankara last month, showing their confidence in Turkish
anti-narcotics forces, it added.
</P>
<P>
The police authorities acknowledged that "there were some
security officials and other officials collaborating with criminal
organizations. But they were arrested and punished."
</P>
<P>
The statement said, however, that some claims overstated the
presence of officials committing crimes, "created a negative image
for Turkey in the international platform" and damaged "our struggle
against drug smuggling."

<P>
Gaza, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah
al-Khatib Gaza on Saturday delivered a message of support from
Jordanian King Abdullah to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ahead
of the Camp David summit slated for July 11.
</P>
<P>
"It is a significant message from King Abdullah and Jordanian
Prime Minister Ali Abu al-Ragheb," Arafat told reporters following
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he discussed with the Jordanian minister "
difficulties facing the peace process."
</P>
<P>
For his part, al-Khatib said "This message marks the continuity
of sustained linkage between both parties."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that King Abdullah wanted via his message to
express full support to Arafat and the Palestinian delegation that
will head for Washington for participation in the weighty Camp
David summit, crossing his fingers that the Palestinian people can
notch up their legitimate ambitions and fully restore their rights.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan's interest is very articulate and big in achieving the
peace process that may restore the Palestinians their legitimate
rights mainly including the establishment of their independent
state on their territories," al-Khatib added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat last Thursday phoned King Abdullah and on Friday held

<HEADLINE> U.N. Deploys Military Observers in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has deployed
military observers in most of the government controlled and rebel
areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a Zimbabwe
National Army (ZNA) official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Spokesman Charles Mugari said in a statement that the
withdrawal of Zimbabwean, Namibian and Angolan troops from the
DRC which supported the DRC government troops to fight the rebels
backed by the Ugandan and Rwandan troops was now imminent
following the U.N. move.
</P>
<P>
Mugari said that "efforts by the United Nations Observer
Mission to Congo have started to gain ground. In Kisangani,
Rwandan and Ugandan troops have completely withdrawn 70 or 30
kilometers respectively."
</P>
<P>
He said the ZNA commander Constantine Chiwengwa was on a tour
of the DRC to brief the allied troops on the ceasefire and the
deployment of the U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
He said Chiwengwa would visit the western, northern and eastern
parts of the DRC where Zimbabwean, Namibian and Angolan troops
were operating.
</P>
<P>
The three countries mounted a defence of the DRC capital
Kinshasa in mid- 1998 against rebels which fought to topple the
Laurent Kabila government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. promised to send at least 5,500 peacekeepers to
compliment the Lusaka ceasefire agreement signed by all the
belligerents in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been criticized for sending such a few
peacekeepers to the vast country and also for taking long to
deploy them.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have pledged to remove their
troops from the DRC once the U.N. peacekeepers were in the
country.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Offers Loan to Africa to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Saturday it had set aside 500 million U.S. dollars for anti-AIDS
programs in African countries.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came on the eve of the 13th International
AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Vice president of the bank's Africa region, Callisto Madavo,
said the money would come from the bank's soft loan window, the
International Development Association, to fund HIV/AIDS programs
on standard terms of 40 years maturity including 10 years grace.
</P>
<P>
"All that is needed is a sound national AIDS strategy developed
in a participatory way backed by serious government commitment," a
World Bank statement from Washington said.
</P>
<P>
Madavo stressed AIDS was not only a health problem but also a
development one, but "only where governments show leadership can
international support be effective".

<TEXT>
<P>
Zuma was speaking while unveiling a giant, red,
three-dimensional AIDS ribbon in Durban in memory of those South
Africans who had died of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The memorial was unveiled ahead of Sunday's start of the 13th
International AIDS Conference in Durban.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said he wanted the memorial to be a symbol of the struggle
of the many South Africans that had and still continued to fight
the disease.
</P>
<P>
"I would like it to serve as a source of courage and
inspiration to all those who live with the disease, to those who
share their homes and lives with victims.
</P>
<P>
"Let their memory in the form of this symbol serve as a
reminder to us at all times that these are not normal times..,"
Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 4.2 million South Africans suffer from
HIV/AIDS while there are 1,700 new infections a day.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said it was in the power of all South Africans to reverse
the rampant path of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
"We need to see more South Africans take up the battle cry in
large numbers to avert the threat of disaster that faces us," Zuma
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the best news that will come out of the conference, as
far as he was concerned, is that an AIDS vaccine will go on trial
soon in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine, a partnership between Britain and Kenya, will go
on trial in the next few months. It would be the first vaccine
aimed at the African HIV strains.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said this news would give hope to those living with the
disease.

<HEADLINE> OAU Supports UN Sanctions on Sierra Leone Diamonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhang Dacheng
</P>
<P>
LOME, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim said here Saturday that
the regional body supports sanctions imposed by the United Nations
on Sierra Leone diamonds exports.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua, during a break of the plenary session of the
72nd ordinary session of the OAU council of ministers, that it was
very import for African countries to be in the forefront to fight
against the utilization of diamonds for the perpetration of civil
wars.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously when the (UN) Security Council takes this decision
of that nature, the members of the organization have clear
responsibility to comply with that," he added.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council Wednesday voted 14-0 in a resolution to
impose a ban on the diamonds from Sierra Leone, where a thriving
illegal diamond trade is fanning the civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council decides that all States shall take the
necessary measures to prohibit the direct or indirect import of
all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone to their territory," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Salim also urged Liberian President Charles Taylor to help OAU
in winning the release of all the UN peacekeepers held by Sierra
Leone armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
"We think we should try to make it a task less difficult by
trying to encourage them to go on that purpose so that
peacekeepers are released," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Angola which boycotts the forthcoming 36th OAU
summit to be opened here on Monday, Salim said that the UN
sanctions on the Angolan rebels was important to reach
reconciliation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"I can understand that the Angolans are concerned about the
violation of sanctions, but my view has always been that the
question of sanctions is important for all the African countries,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia and Cape Verde have threatened to boycott the
Lome summit on account of alleged violation by the Togolese
government of the UN sanctions against the rebel National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Salim expected the international community to implement the
sanctions against UNITA with the African states in the forefront.
</P>
<P>
"Though Angolan government is not here, the discussion on
Angola was very constructive, and literally there was a total
commitment of the African countries to do their utmost to
implement sanctions," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
The African ministers are in a three-day session to make
preparations for the summit which is expected to discuss mainly on
the three themes of regional cooperation and integration, security
and stability, and the challenges of widespread AIDS and poverty
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
African leaders will also discuss the draft treaty on the
establishment of the African Union initiated during an
extraordinary summit on September 9, 1999, in Syrte, Libya as well
as the treaty on the African Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
Ways to end various conflicts on the continent, particularly in
Angola, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra
Leone, and the related situation of refugees will also be on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Founded on May 25, 1963, the OAU is designated to promote the
unity and solidarity of the African states, defend the
sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of members,
and intensify the cooperation and efforts to achieve a better life
for the people of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Following eradicating all forms of colonialism from Africa, the
 organization has been focused on peace and development in the new
millennium and reversion of the growing marginalization of Africa
in economic globalization.

<HEADLINE> IMF Supports Debt Relief for Developing Countries: Kohler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund was in favor of bolder debt relief and the restructuring of
developing countries' voting powers within the organization,
visiting IMF managing director Horst Kohler has said.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association Saturday quoted Kohler as
saying that he had discussed the issue with South African
President Thabo Mbeki in Pretoria earlier.
</P>
<P>
"President Mbeki has told me that he would like to see the
speeding up of that process, and I agreed and told him that I
will take the matter to the IMF," he said.
</P>
<P>
But, Kohler warned that his duty would only be to recommend
since the decision to cancel the debt would only come from "those
who were being owed" .
</P>
<P>
He said developing countries needed to work harder to get
credibility and demonstrate they were building economies based on
legitimate democratic structures, free of corruption and
maladministration.
</P>
<P>
Kohler's visit was the last leg of his African tour which
included Nigeria, Senegal, Botswana and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF was in the process of reforming itself and that
 he was trying to listen to everyone, particularly the African
nations.
</P>
<P>
Kohler explained that despite holding the post for only two
months, he had taken the tour of developing countries to get a
first hand experience.

<HEADLINE> Iran Lashes out at U.S. for Stance over Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRNA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi has strongly lashed out at the United States for
its stance against Iran's verdicts on 10 Iranian Jews on charge of
spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran does not allow
any foreign country to interfere in Iran's internal affairs," Asefi
said on Friday evening, quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iranian judiciary is entitled to deal independently
with judicial matters in the country.
</P>
<P>
"How can American officials allow themselves to interfere with
such impudence in the internal affairs of the Islamic Republic of
Iran?" he questioned.
</P>
<P>
Asefi voiced Iran's anger after the U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Wednesday assured U.S. Jewish leaders that he will work to win
the release of the Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he will try to mobilize leaders in Europe, Russia,
Japan and other countries that have closer ties with Iran to work
together with the U.S. to secure the release of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian revolutionary court on July 1 sentenced 10 Jews to
four to 13 years in prison. Two Muslims also received sentences of
two years, while three other Jews and two Muslims were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman said the subsequent statements by U.S.
officials over the spy case indicate the influence of the Zionist
(Israeli) regime on the government in Washington.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. officials not to come under the influence
of the Israeli regime and stop repeating unlawful and illogical
statements about the spy case.

<P>
OTTAWA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Canadian police have busted one of
the largest Ecstasy labs and arrested two suspects in Markham,
Toronto, the Toronto Sun newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After a month-long probe, police moved in Friday on the lab
nestled in a two-story house, where they arrested two men aged 20
and 21 and seized an AK-47 assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
Police also evacuated 16 Markham homes, fearing an explosion or
toxic spill of chemicals used to make the so-called "love drug".
</P>
<P>
"There's a whole bunch of chemicals in there from sulphuric
acid, acetate, nitrogen gas, nitro-methane, methylene chloride,"
said Const. Michele Paradis.
</P>
<P>
Health Canada chemist John Hugel said similar labs usually have
one or two 20-litre pails of chemicals, but this one had 20 or 30
such containers.

<HEADLINE> Putin Lists Russia's Most Pressing Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on
Saturday listed the alarming demographic situation, economic
recession and the possibility of Russia's degeneration into a poor
country as the state's most pressing problems to be solved.
</P>
<P>
"The complicated demographic situation, the reduction of the
Russian population, is one of the gravest problems facing our
country," he told the Federal Assembly in his first state-of-
nation address.
</P>
<P>
"There are fewer and fewer of us, Russia's citizens, from year
to year," Putin said, noting that the population of the nation
decreases annually by 750,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the number of Russians may drop by 22 million
in 15 years. If the present trend keeps up, the survival of the
nation will be endangered," Putin warned.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to work hard to draw the country's bewildering
ailing economy out of a long-lasting depression so that Russia can
avoid the fate of degenerating into a poor country of "the so-
called third world."
</P>
<P>
"Will we be able to remain as a nation if our people's well-
being depends on obtaining international credits?" Putin asked the
deputies rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will be strong only with a strong economy... A
powerful state, a stable economic growth and the people's well-
being are our top priority tasks and most important goals," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Mt. Oyama on Volcanic Miyakejima Island Erupts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Mt. Oyama on Miyakejima, one of
Japan's small volcanic islands some 180 kilometers south of Tokyo,
erupted Saturday evening with little harm expected for the island
with a population of some 3,900, according to the country's
Meteorological Agency.
</P>
<P>
The mountain erupted only one time. The eruption began at
around 6:43 p.m. (1543 GMT), shooting smoke to 800 meters above
the crater while spewing out a small amount of volcanic ashes. The
smoke disappeared at around 6:50 p.m. (1550 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The island's authorities are trying to confirm whether any
damage has been incurred, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
Tsutomu Takeuchi, chief of the meteorological agency's Volcano
Division, said the eruption, with its force within the agency's
prediction, does not represent activity by new magma.
</P>
<P>
He added that while the agency does not think the eruption
would affect the residential area at the foot of the mountain, it
is asking the residents to take precautions for the time being.
</P>
<P>
The authorities issued an evacuation order for majority of the
island's residents when volcanic activities of Mt. Oyama started
on June 26. The order, however, was lifted three days later after
volcanologists said the whole island would be safe.

Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations ended their one-day

to take a coordinated policy over economic and financial
challenges posed by the information technology (IT) revolution,
Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,

<P>
On the world economy, the finance chiefs welcomed an

a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa said the ministers agreed on the importance of
carrying out sound financial, macroeconomic and structural
policies to achieve strong and sustainable economic growth over
the medium term.
</P>
<P>
On the IT issue, the G-7 ministers for the first time held in-
depth talks on the IT boom's impact on macroeconomic, financial
and tax policies, with attention on how to maximize the benefits
of the new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
They said in a report that "the advance of the IT revolution
holds the promise of becoming a major force in the global economy
in improving productivity, raising maximum potential output, and
promoting higher living."

Doerte Lindner of Germany scored an aggregate 528.72 to finish
runner-up and Anna Lindberg of Sweden, bronze medallist in 1997,

sector.
</P>
<P>
The number of signatories of the corporation's agreement until

ANKARA -- The Turkish Treasury announced that 1.2 billion U.S.
dollars in foreign capital investments were permitted in the first
half of 2000, up by 28.1 percent as compared to the same period
last year, reported Turkish Daily News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Permissions were issued for foreign investments mainly in the
service sector, which attracted 78.9 percent of the foreign
capital, followed by the manufacturing industry with 16.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has given permission for 26.75 billion
dollars in foreign investments since 1980.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait's oil revenues are expected to reach about
5 billion dinars (16.5 billion U.S. dollars) during the fiscal year
2000/2001 due to the rising oil prices in the global markets.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti News Agency Friday quoted a weekly report by the "
Shaal Office for Economic Studies" as saying that non-oil revenues
will hit 450 million dinars (1.485 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
On Kuwait's crude oil production, the report said it will reach

CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- A project for medicines production, recently approved
by the Bahraini cabinet, is expected to put Bahrain on the top of
the countries making progress in the production of drugs in the
Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
A Saudi daily on Saturday quoted Bahraini Minister of Oil and
Industry Sheikh Isa Al-Khalifa as saying the total investment in
the project is estimated at 50 million U.S. dollars, with an annual
production capacity of about 4,154 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
He stated the project is being carried out by a Swiss company
specialized in drugs and medicines industry. The factory is
expected to produce medicines and drugs used in the treatment of
diseases like cholesterol, cancer, kidney and liver diseases, heart
diseases and neurotic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
He added the new company will export most of its products to the
world markets.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish construction company Ceylan Insaat has sealed
a contract to build 3,500 houses worth 150 million U.S. dollars in
Skopje, Macedonia, reported Turkish Daily News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ceylan Holding CEO Mahmut Ceylan said Friday the company will
start construction of the houses this year and complete the work
within three years.
</P>
<P>
He said talks on other schemes in Macedonia are continuing.
Ceylan has undertaken contracts in Israel, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan
and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- Algeria, which consumes about 5 million tons of
grains annually, is expected to see its harvest of grains decline
from 2.2 million tons last year to 1 million tons this season due
to the ongoing severe drought.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of rains had a devastating effect on the areas of
grains planting.
</P>
<P>
The process of harvesting is currently underway and there may be
an increase in the crops, but it is unlikely to exceed 1.2 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Shanghai and Istanbul, the two largest cities of China
and Turkey, are keen to strengthen their economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with visiting Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi on Friday,
Istanbul Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna noted that Shanghai, one of the
most important doors of China opening up to the outside world, is
dynamic and continuously developing.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul is Turkey's biggest, most dynamic city and a door
opening to the outside world, Gurtuna stated.
</P>
<P>
He wished relations between Shanghai and Istanbul will continue
to develop.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Xu said he shares the points of view of Mayor
Gurtuna, adding Turkey and China are getting closer by direct
flights that take place twice a week.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his stay in Istanbul, he met with Turkish
businessmen who requested an increase in the number of the flights
and that he shared the ideas with them.

<HEADLINE> Union Urges Protection of Arrested Turkish Cypriot Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Union of Cyprus Journalists
(UCJ) Saturday appealed for the protection of Turkish Cypriot
journalists arrested Friday by the Turkish Cypriot regime in the
northern island.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made to U.N. Secretary-General's Special
Representative in Cyprus, the ambassadors of the permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council and international media organizations.
</P>
<P>
In the appeal, the UCJ reported the arrest and disappearance
Friday night of Editor-in-Chief of Turkish Cypriot daily "Avrupa"
Sener Levent and two or more of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
"Avrupa" has been persecuted by the Turkish Cypriot regime
because of its views on the Cyprus issue, said the UCJ.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot regime in May confiscated the daily's
equipment and furnitures, after the daily refused to pay a 290,000-
U.S.-dollar fine for alleged defamation of Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The UCJ said that despite the efforts by the families and the
lawyers of the arrested journalists to find out where they are
held, the Turkish Cypriot authorities refuse to give any
information.
</P>
<P>
"We have strong reasons to fear that the lives of the arrested
Turkish Cypriot journalists are in great danger," the UCJ appeal
said.
</P>
<P>
The UCJ said that the fear is based on the accusations labelled
against them by the Turkish Cypriot "Bayrak" radio, controlled by
Turkish army officers and Denktash's administration, that these
Turkish Cypriot journalists are "a gang of conspirators against the
Turkish army."
</P>
<P>
The UCJ called for urgent and effective actions to protect the
lives of Sener Levent and his colleagues and to ensure their
immediate release.
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus has remained divided
into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities since 1974 when
Turkey invaded and occupied the northern part of the island after a
failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
In 1983 the Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally a breakaway
republic, which is only recognized by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> FAO Appeals to Increase Food Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) has warned that the world has to increase food
production in the next 50 years if hunger is to be eradicated.
</P>
<P>
In a statement obtained here on Saturday, the FAO said that as
the world population increases from the present 6 billion to 8.9
billion, food production should also be boosted.
</P>
<P>
Growing enough food will not lead to the eradication of hunger
unless measures are put in place to make sure that the food gets
into the hands and mouths of the people who lack it, the FAO
said.
</P>
<P>
These measures should involve increasing rural incomes and
access to food by improving agriculture and rural economy, it
added.
</P>
<P>
It observed that 20 percent of people in the developing
countries today survive on diets that do not provide the basic
energy that they need to be active and productive.
</P>
<P>
According to the FAO, hunger and micro-nutrients and
deficiencies have decreased children's learning capacity by up to
10 percent and costed developing countries up to 128 billion U.S.
dollars per year in productivity losses.
</P>
<P>
There is need to take advantage of the new technologies which
hold great potential for improving yield and nutritional quality,
FAO said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency noted that the risks posed by genetically
modified foods should also be reduced as these could have an
adverse effect on human health.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the World Food Day will be observed
on October 16 under the theme "A millennium Free from Hunger".

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Amend Marriage Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China aims to amend its 20-year-old
Marriage Law, to deal with newly-arising social problems such as
bigamy, concubinage, domestic violence and shirking the
responsibility of taking care of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Hu Kangsheng, deputy director of the Legislative Affairs
Commission under the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, said that research on the law amendment is now under
way, involving officials and experts from women's federations,
civil affairs departments and courts.
</P>
<P>
Hu gave an explanation of the various aspects of this job
during the amendment work at a workshop here today attended by Li
Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, and other committee
members.
</P>
<P>
Although the experts agreed to persist in the principles of
freedom of marriage, monogamy and gender equality, and the
prohibition of domestic violence, spouse abuse and abandonment,
they differed on how to decide the criteria for divorce and
whether to introduce a system to compensate one side in a divorce
case, as well as on laying the blame in divorce cases, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
While about nine million couples tie the nuptial knot each year
in China, some 450,000 couples get divorced according to mutual
agreement, and about 700,000 couples end their marriage relations
through court verdict or mediation.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that China's monogamy system has been under
challenge as a result of the increasing phenomenon of bigamy,
concubinage, illegal cohabitation and ex-marital affairs.
</P>
<P>
In some prosperous provinces such as south China's Guangdong,
the phenomenon of "bao er nai," or taking a concubine, is on the
rise as some overseas businessmen, heads of enterprises, company
managers, private businessmen, and even the Communist Party and
government officials keep mistresses, Hu said.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Amend Marriage Law (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Such social evils not only go against socialist ethics, but
also corrupt social values and cause family breakups, murders and
suicides due to love affairs, thus threatening social stability
and the policy of family planning," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Some experts have suggested stipulating the rights of spouses
in the law amendment, while some others insist that mutual
responsibility for faithfulness and cohabitation be written in the
law.
</P>
<P>
Although the current marriage law includes an article against
domestic violence, statistics show that violence occurs in 30
percent of Chinese families, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
All the experts agreed that domestic violence must be punished.
However, they have different ideas about how to judge violent
behavior.
</P>
<P>
Arguments have also been prompted on how the amended law would
define the criteria for permitting divorce, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Some experts insisted that the current criteria, which focus on
the breakdown of mutual affection, should be changed into the
breakdown of nuptial relations since it is hard for the court to
measure the degree of affection. others worry that the criteria
for divorce might be softened.
</P>
<P>
Experts also expressed their concern about juvenile crime
caused by divorce, quoting statistics as saying that more than 40
percent of young people in divorced families commit crimes. Also,
cases of abusing elderly people and shirking the responsibility to
take care of them are on rise in China.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that the NPC Standing Committee has decided to
discuss the amendment to Marriage Law this year, because the
stability of marriage and the family is a key factor in overall
social stability and social progress.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment will be published nationwide at the proper
time, for the lawmakers to study and consider opinions from all
walks of life, he added.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Mainland Kids Saved by Heart Surgery in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Tan Rong, a three-year-old girl
from the Chinese mainland with congenital heart defects, paid
farewell to Hong Kong jubilantly Saturday after a successful heart
surgery.
</P>
<P>
Tan Rong, from a secluded village in the inland province of
Anhui, together with a four-year-old boy from the province of
Guangdong, are two lucky kids who were born in impoverished
families but chosen by Hong Kong Children's Heart Fund for charge-
free heart surgical correction.
</P>
<P>
"I am so happy, and I cannot describe it," said the mother of
the girl, who, in the past three years, has impotently seen her
only daughter suffering from repeated pneumonia and spending the
majority of her first year of life in hospital.
</P>
<P>
It was until September 1998 that she was told for the first
time by doctors that her daughter had a congenital heart disease
in the form of a 1.8-cm hole between the two upper chambers and
needed surgical correction.
</P>
<P>
How can a peasant family afford an expensive heart surgical
correction?
</P>
<P>
Having waited in desperation for more than a year, the family
was informed in May this year by the Shanghai Children's Medical
Center that Tan Rong would get help from the Hong Kong Children's
Heart Fund, which has helped about five mainland children with
congenital heart disease.
</P>
<P>
Like Tan Rong, four-year-old Yang Tianlun from Zhongshan of
Guangdong Province, also suffered from congenital heart disease
and cannot walk far. Children similar to him normally do not live
more than ten years without surgery, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
After a surgery two days before Tan Rong, Yang Tianlun can now
"walk more than 10 meters without a rest," the boy's father said.
His mother hoped her son would grow up with a kind heart knowing "
he has been saved by donations from kind-hearted people."
</P>
<P>
Seven out of 1,000 babies are born with congenital heart
diseases, but not all of them need surgery correction, according
to doctors at Hong Kong Adventist Hospital, which carried out
operations for the two mainland children.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Children's Heart Fund has been helping Hong Kong
children with congenital heart diseases starting from 1991. Since
Hong Kong's return to the motherland in 1997, the help has been
extended to mainland children.
</P>
<P>
During a scientific meeting in Shanghai last winter, the
Children Heart Fund reached an agreement with two mainland major
children medical centers, including the Shanghai medical center,
to carry out charge-free heart surgical correction for
impoverished mainland children.
</P>
<P>
After Tan Rong and Yang Tianlun, more mainland children with
congenital heart defects are expected to arrive in Hong Kong for
surgical correction, doctors at Hong Kong Adventist Hospital said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Begins Construction of Deep Tunnel Sewerage System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Saturday began
construction of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS), a long-
term project which will transform the management of wastewater in
the city state by convey sewage flows to the deep waters of the
Singapore Straits.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ground-breaking ceremony to mark the beginning
of construction of the ever largest sewerage system in Singapore,
Singapore Minister for the Environment and Minister for
Information and the Arts Lee Yock Suan said the ceremony is "a
milestone event in the development of our sanitation system in
Singapore."
</P>
<P>
"To be built at a cost of about 6 billion Singapore dollars (
about 3.5 billion U.S. dollars, it will meet needs of Singapore's
increasing population and expanding economy through the 21st
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
The DTSS will comprises the North Tunnel, the South Tunnel and
a Spur Tunnel linking them as well as two centralized sewerage
treatment works located at the country's southeast and southwest
corners in areas zoned for industrial use.
</P>
<P>
The project is to be built in two phases over the next 15 years
with Phase One scheduled to go into operation in 2008 and Phase
Two slated to be operational in 2015.

<HEADLINE> At Least 10 People Killed in Somali Clan Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were killed
and more than 16 others wounded when heavy fighting flared up
between rival militiamen in Dharkaynley district of Southwest
Mogadishu, Somalia Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the fighting was between militiamen
loyal to Hussein Aidid and a religious group from the Dudubleh
clan based in and around the Dabaqayn mosque of Dharkaynley
district.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting, Aidid's militiamen used anti-aircraft
rockets, heavy machine guns mounted on battle wagons and all kinds
of assault rifles while those of their opponents merely employed
rocket-propelled grenades, automatic assault rifles and hand
grenades.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness in the area told the reporter that he had seen
the bodies of three men from the Dudubleh clan religious group as
they were pushed back a while in the first round of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The fighting culminated after the militiamen of Muse Sudi
Yalahow joined the fighting along side the religious group against
arch-rival Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Thunderous noise of recoilless rifles and mortar rounds were
heard in every corner of the city, reminding the people the sad
old days of the fighting between late General Farah Aidid and Ali
Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
According to confirmed sources, the joint forces of the
Dudubleh religious group and Yalahow's fighters have managed to
repulse back the advancing militiamen of Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed sources said the militiamen led by Aidid were
forced to retreat back and even loose control of the Galbed police
station and its surrounding areas which they earlier controlled.
</P>
<P>
Even though the dead were mainly combat militiamen, still there
were quite a number of innocent civilians caught in the middle of
the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
A lady selling tea right at the place said that she had seen
the dead bodies of a beggar and a herdsman whom no one could
identify which clan they belonged to.
</P>
<P>
It is not known how many of Aidid's militiamen died in the
fighting, but sources close to his militiamen said that three of
his fighters were killed and more than six others suffered various
gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
The fighting subsided early in the evening Friday night and the
 situation in the area remained calm for a period. However, it
became tense again on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is not yet stated officially;
however, independent sources confirmed that taxing of the
commercial goods going in or out of Dharkaynley district has been
the main reason behind the squabble which led to the bloody armed
confrontation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Aidid's militiamen erected a roadblock in the street to Medina
district in which they asked the traffic to pay them extortion
money before they proceeded to their destinations, something the
religious group denied.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the fighting in Medina, there had also been several
other skirmishes elsewhere in Mogadishu. Sporadic exchange of fire
continued early in the morning on Saturday in North Mogadishu
between rival militiamen, but no deaths were reported even though
several people were wounded.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Seeks Preferential Trade Agreement With SACU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is negotiating for a
preferential trade agreement with the Southern Africa Customs
Union (SACU) to enable Zambian products to enter the markets of
its member countries.
</P>
<P>
Briefing journalists in a press conference here on Saturday,
Zambian Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry William
Harrington said Zambia is not seeking to join the SACU which
groups Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is simply negotiating for a preferential trade agreement
with the SACU members at preferential tariffs, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed Zambia-SACU agreement has been on the
negotiating table for five years.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is meant to be an interim measure to allow Zambia
to gain preferential access into SACU and would fall off with the
implementation of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) protocol, since Zambia and all SACU countries are members
of SADC, he said.
</P>
<P>
Selected Zambian products would enjoy preferential access into
SACU through a quota system, the minister said, adding that while
Zambia will not be required to reciprocate with South Africa, it
would have to reciprocate with Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and
Swaziland on certain products.
</P>
<P>
Non-reciprocity with South Africa was agreed to due to the
recognition of the large trade imbalance between South Africa and
Zambia in the ratio of 28 to one in favor of South Africa, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Harrington, the trade and industry ministers of
Zambia and the SACU countries meeting in July 1998 in Pretoria,
South Africa had endorsed the agreement in principal, although
there are still a few outstanding issues which have to be resolved
at a bilateral level between Zambia, Lesotho, Namibia and
Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
He said on his way from signing the Cotonou Agreement in Benin
last month, he met his South African counterpart Alec Erwin.
</P>
<P>
"Both my counterpart and I agreed that it would be important to
 concentrate on the SADC trade protocol which is only about two
months a way from implementation," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges 30 Million U.S. Dollars to Help Malawi Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States has pledged to
support Malawi's fight against the scourge of HIV/AIDS with 30
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here on Saturday quoted Ellen Shippy, U.S.
ambassador to Malawi, as saying that the assistance is in line
with U.S. President Bill Clinton's 1999 LIFE initiative, which
singles out HIV/AIDS support to 15 developing countries around the
world. "The United States will continue to support efforts in
Malawi to prevent new infections and those already infected,"
Shippy said.
</P>
<P>
The LIFE initiative came fast on the heel of another pledge by
the United Nations agencies and donors who, three months ago,
vowed to set aside 110 million dollars to assist Malawi's
five-year HIV/AIDS strategic plan.
</P>
<P>
AIDS has wiped out most socio-economic gains Malawi has
achieved since independence from Britain 36 years ago, the World
Bank said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the life expectancy in the country has fallen
from 47 years in the mid-1980s to 36 years nowadays largely due to
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita income for Malawi's 10 million people
has also been slashed from 220 dollars to less than 200 dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the National AIDS Control Program, at least 14
percent of Malawi's population is carrying HIV and the killer
disease has already claimed over 360,000 lives and created over a
million orphans since the first AIDS case was diagnosed in the
country in 1985.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
vowed here Saturday to carry out an omnidirectional and
independent foreign policy and to pursue the anti-terrorist
operation in Chechnya to "a perfect end."
</P>
<P>
"Russia is and will be pursuing an independent foreign policy,
which is based on the principles of pragmatism and efficiency and
gives priority to national interests," Putin said in his first
state-of-nation address to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia has encountered a new type of foreign
aggression -- international terrorism -- and, in fact, "a
challenge to its sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Russia's campaign against international
terrorism quite often draws a negative response abroad, Putin said,
adding that it is the priority of its foreign policy tasks to
explain Russia's counter-terrorism efforts.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya
helped to avert the threat of Russia's break-up.
</P>
<P>
The territory of Chechnya has actually become a beachhead for
international terrorist forces whose actions have threatened
Russia's unity in the past few years, and only anti-terrorist
operations can make Russia preserve territorial integrity, the
president stressed.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the important role of the federal military in
solving this problem, pledging to push forward the anti-terrorist
campaign to a full success.

<HEADLINE> Amendments to Customs Law Tighten Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The just-passed Amendments to the
Customs Law considerably expand the power of the customs to crack
down on smugglers, but at the same time it tightens the
supervision of the customs service, especially that of senior
customs officers.
</P>
<P>
The Amendments were passed here today at the 16th meeting of
the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (
NPC), which closed this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Amendments, which consist of 71 articles, will go into
effect January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Amendments entitle customs officers to the same rights as
public security bodies regarding investigation, detention, arrest
and preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese lawmakers voiced concern that the actions of customs
officers should be more closely monitored when deliberating the
draft of the Amendments.
</P>
<P>
"Of the most serious smuggling cases uncovered so far, some
involved senior customs officers," said Tao Siju, a member of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee, citing a recent
notorious case in Zhanjiang, a coastal city in south China.
</P>
<P>
"Many customs officials have participated in smuggling or
colluded with smugglers," said Tao, who is a former minister of
public security.
</P>
<P>
The anti-smuggling fight necessitates not only adequate power
and equipment, but also more qualified customs officials, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
The Amendments lay down that a system of regular exchange and
assessment of senior customs officers as well as a system of
enrollment of new customs staff through examinations be
established.
</P>
<P>
In his closing speech, NPC Chairman Li Peng said that the
passage of the Amendments facilitates the crackdown on smuggling
activities and the supervision of the customs.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Hold Medical Exhibition to Promote Health Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Medical companies from Arab,
European and other countries will hold an exhibition in the Iraqi
capital Baghdad this week, an official said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Omar Al-Kubaisi, director of the Saddam Health Center, said the
exhibition will group companies from Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Qatar,
the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, France, Italy,
Spain, Portugal, Germany, Indonesia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been intensifying efforts to alleviate the devastating
impacts of the decade-old United Nations sanctions.
</P>
<P>
To hold such exhibitions or products fairs have enabled Iraq to
sign contracts with foreign countries to import medicine, food and
other humanitarian supplies under the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian deal, in place since late 1996, allows
Iraq to sell limited amount of oil to help offset the stringent U.
N. sanctions, which Iraq said have caused a humanitarian crisis in
the country.

under five and the elderly, have died as a direct result of the
sanctions.

warned that Iraq's health system is close to collapse and
threatening the very survival of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set up Mangrove Forest Gene Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- In an attempt to protect bio-
diversity, a gene bank will be set up in the Sundarbans, the
largest mangrove forest of the world located in the southwestern
coast of Bangladesh, Forest Ministry sources said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Forest Ministry has approved a proposal to set
up the bank on 40 hectares of land at Dhangmari and Burigoalini in
the Sundarbans, the sources said, noting that this will be the
first mangrove forest gene bank in the world.
</P>
<P>
Under World Bank's Forest Research Management Project, the bank
will be set up with the financial help of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The sources said there are 330 species of plants, 120 fishes,
eight amphibian animals, 50 reptiles, 42 mammals, 270 birds and 60
shrimps and crabs living in the Sundarbans. Due to various adverse
effects and environmental pollution, many species are on the verge
of extinction.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Sundarbans, plant species of other mangrove
forests across the world would be preserved in the gene bank.
Besides, integrated research would be conducted on the threatened
species for their preservation, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Burundi Peace Process Moves Towards Advanced Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Pang Yong
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Work on various draft
protocols towards achievement of peace in Burundi has reached an
advanced stage although disagreements on several main sticking
points still exist.
</P>
<P>
According to Judge Mark Bomani, head of the Burundi peace
facilitation team, his team has been revising the draft peace
proposals, "updating them to take into account response of various
parties."
</P>
<P>
Bomani and his team are currently continuing their talks in
Tanzania's northern town of Arusha in an effort to produce draft
documents by the end of July to form the basis of a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The team will meet mediator, former South African president
Nelson Mandela for consultations in Johannesburg on July 10,
Bomani said.
</P>
<P>
All 19 parties featuring the talks have submitted their inputs
on the draft peace text, he said, stressing that CNDD-FDD (the
National Defense Council of Democracy - the Defense Force of
Democracy), a major breakaway armed rebel group, also submitted
its ideas last week.
</P>
<P>
However, Bomani said his team is still waiting for draft
proposals from another important rebel group FNL (the National
Liberation Force), a splinter of PALIPEHUTU (the Hutu People's
Liberation Party), to complete all protocols.
</P>
<P>
According to Bomani, the fifth committee of the facilitation
team, which deals with peace implementation and guarantees, will
reconvene in Arusha on July 17 to finalize pending issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mandela said in an interview with South African
Broadcasting Corporation last Tuesday that he expected factions in
the Burundi civil war to sign a peace deal on July 20.
</P>
<P>
The proposed agreement reportedly centers on creating a
transitional government, integrating Hutu rebels into the army and
establishing an electoral system that will ensure power-sharing
between the minority Tutsis and majority Hutus.
</P>
<P>
However, during the ongoing Arusha talks, heads of the 19
delegations still can not agree on several crucial issues on the
electoral system and the transitional government, Burundi Charge
d'Affaires in Dar es Salaam Emmanuel Rwamibango told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Some heads have suggested a one-man-one-vote system while
others maintain that each tribe elects its own leaders, the envoy
said.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Karumba, leader of the Front for National Liberation
(FROLINA), was reported as saying recently that the Group 7
composed of major rebel parties are against a transitional
government led by Major Pierre Buyoya and plan to propose its own
leader to run the transitional government.
</P>
<P>
On the pending issue of the composition of defense force and
security, some insist to keep the current army to integrate all
citizens, including people from the armed rebel group, providing
that they are able to meet the provided conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Group 7 reportedly insisted that armed rebel
groups should occupy at least 60 percent of a new national army
while the existing Bujumbura soldiers should share the remaining
40 percent. Mandela suggested a ratio of 50 to 50.
</P>
<P>
One of the remaining obstacles in the way of a workable and
implementable agreement is the lack of a minimum degree of trust
amongst some of the opposing key role-players, critics said.
</P>
<P>
It is due to this lack of trust that both sides, those who have
the power and those who lost it for instance, believe that the
other side will again misbehave once a transitional government is
put in place.
</P>
<P>
"Hutus believe that the Tutsis will use any positions of
authority to again undermine democracy, while Tutsis believe that
Hutus will misuse power in such a way that the physical security
of Tutsis as a group will again be threatened," a Burundian said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, although the formal inclusion of the
two once excluded major rebel movements, the CNDD-FDD and the
PALIPEHUTU-FNL, is probably the single most important objective of
the new mediation of Mandela, their full participation has not yet
been finally achieved.
</P>
<P>
Neither of the movements' leaders attended the meeting held in
Pretoria, South Africa at the end of May, which was supposed to be
the first meeting in which all armed movements were to
participate.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned that it will be problematical to move towards
any kind of agreements if these armed movements do not actively
participate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
It is evident that without the participation of these two
formerly excluded rebel movements, the Burundi civil war, which
has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced 1.2 million over
the past seven years, will not end, said Jan Eck, a senior
consultant on Burundi to the Center for Conflict Resolution based
in Cape Town, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Unless there is an end to the war, there can not be a real
peace agreement, and even if an agreement were to be signed at
Arusha, it would obviously be impossible to implement it, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The latest Burundian conflict goes back to October 1993, when
Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu who won
Burundi's first democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
Ndadaye's election immediately spread panic among the Tutsis,
who had control of the army, economy and government since the
country won independence from Belgium in 1962.
</P>
<P>
Mandela took over as mediator in last December from late
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere and has been trying to speed up
the talks, which have dragged on since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mandela invited all the Hutu rebel groups that had been
previously excluded to take part in the peace process.
Negotiations over the past 24 months in Arusha have worked out
the outlines of a peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Pays Debt for Former State-Run Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has paid this
year about 300 billion Kwacha (about 100 million U.S. dollars)
owed to the companies that supplied goods to the former state-run
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the Zambia Daily Mail
newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After the payment, the debt ZCCM owes to its suppliers was
reduced to 91 billion Kwacha (about 30 million dollars) .
</P>
<P>
The payment should alleviate the problems the suppliers are
facing, the Times of Zambia newspaper quoted John Nyendwa, general
secretary of the Mine Suppliers and Contractors Association, as
saying on Friday in Kitwe, northern Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The suppliers have lost business because of the delayed payment
and the eroded value of the money, he said, adding that they have
been unable to meet orders made by the new owners of the mines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambia Federation of Employers (ZFE) President
Samuel Musonda said here on Thursday that because the local
companies are facing liquidity problems, foreign companies are
being awarded supplying tenders by new mine owners.
</P>
<P>
"The failure by the former ZCCM to pay our members who supplied
them with various products and services has caused our members to
fail to execute the contracts they are being awarded by new owners
of the mines. As a result of this state of affairs, the new mine
owners are being forced to look to foreign suppliers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the government would quickly attend to the issue
of liquidating the former ZCCM debt.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March this year, privatization of ZCCM has been
completed to attract foreign investment and advanced technology
and management to revive the ailing mining industry of the
copper-producing country.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Inflation up in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The prolonged drought and the
increase in value added tax (VAT) has pushed the country's
inflation up, the Central Bank of Kenya has said.
</P>
<P>
According to its latest monthly economic review, the bank
announced the inflation increase to 8.3 percent in June from 8.2
percent in May, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the increase in inflation to the depression
of the Kenyan shilling, the price hike in fuels, the shortfall in
supply of food and the cost of goods and services caused by the
raise in VAT.
</P>
<P>
Fuel and power, entertainment and education baskets experienced
the highest inflation rates of 14.3 percent and 15.4 percent
respectively, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
While the inflation in the food basket, which has the highest
weight in the consumer price index, reached 4.5 percent in June as
against 3.1 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicts that this upward inflationary trend is
expected to continue in the short-term due to the prolonged
drought and the shilling's depreciation.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Urges S. Leone's Rebel to Embrace Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings has appealed the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
of Sierra Leone to wake up to the new resolve of bringing lasting
peace to the war-torn west African country.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted the Ghana News Agency as saying on Friday in the
capital Accra that Ghana and the international community would not
give the rebel an inch in their bid to derail efforts at evolving
and maintaining a peaceful and democratic atmosphere in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to give an inch to their acts ... and we hope
that they take advantage of the current initiative of the United
Nations and make amends where necessary," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings made the remarks after inspecting a magnificent photo
exhibition, under the theme "Ghana -- four decades of U.N. and
regional peacekeeping", to mark 40 years of Ghana's participation
in U.N. peacekeeping activities.
</P>
<P>
He urged the RUF to take advantage of the new initiatives
outlined by the United Nations and abide by the resolution of the
Security Council to halt the sale of diamonds in return for arms.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
the United Nations has made arrangements to help meet the efforts
of poor countries in supporting the U.N. peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Sierra Leone situation as painful, Annan said
that with the reinforcement of troops, the United Nations would
work with the Sierra Leonean government to stabilize the situation
and strengthen governmental machinery.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone, which has seen more than eight years of
instability manifested by rebel insurgency, is now faced with
making peace with itself and meeting the desires of its people and
the international community following the recent hostage crisis.

LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Colonel Muammar
Al-Gaddafi has called on all warring factions in Africa to lay
down their arms, embrace each other and shake hands as brothers.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Ghana News Agency as saying on Friday in
Kuamsi, central Ghana that "now is the time for another struggle
for African unity".
</P>
<P>
The persisting conflicts and civil wars in Africa have hampered
the social and economic development in the continent, the Libyan
leader said, stressing that more concrete actions should be
adopted to end the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, who is currently on a two-day visit to Ghana during
his trans- Saharan trek to Togo for the forthcoming summit of the
Organization of African Unity, also charged his fellow Africans
not to forget how the West took them as slaves and sold them in
the market.
</P>
<P>
This should not happen again and Africa should be a continent
capable of defending itself against aggressors, he said, noting
that African is rich and has great potential but has been
exploited by the enemy.

</P>
<P>
The operational section is only the first part of a 220 km
highway designed to link Dazhou City with neighboring Chongqing
Municipality. The construction in Sichuan Province will extend the
road by 40 km this year and 88 km next year.
</P>
<P>
Dazhou was a revolutionary base before the founding of New
China in 1949. The previous transportation bottleneck, however,
was a major barrier to its economic growth in the new era of
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.8 billion yuan (about 457 million U.S. dollars) has been
injected into road building in the city over the past six years,
and resulted in 2,980 km of roads. So far, 80 percent of all the
mountain villages have access to road traffic.

the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) and secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal
Committee, during an inspection tour of north China's Inner

Shanghai should increase economic cooperation with the
provinces and regions in western China, and find new ways to
realize common development and prosperity in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has had cooperative ties with Inner Mongolia since the
1960s. It signed 45 cooperation projects with the region last year,
involving 1.1 billion yuan in total investment.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection tour, Shanghai and Inner Mongolia reached
agreements on 51 projects, at a total cost of 2.04 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Attach Importance to Ethical Issues in Genome Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists and experts here
today called on the whole of society to pay attention to ethical
issues in human genome research and try to avoid negative effects
of the research.
</P>
<P>
Human society is not fully prepared in the aspects of
psychology, ethics, law and international relations for the rapid
development of the Human Genome Project (HGP), which will bring
new risks and challenges to mankind, said Yang Huanming, a leading
scientist of the HGP in China.
</P>
<P>
He told a forum held by the China Science, Technology and Law
Association that the key problem of the ethics of human genome
study is to build more harmonious social relations and relations
between mankind and nature, based on the new understanding of such
relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, the application of the results of the HGP
and other genetic techniques should not bring hazards to patients,
people who receive tests, and other relevant persons, but should
benefit the health of all.
</P>
<P>
Things which can be achieved by biological technology are not
necessarily compatible with human ethics, said Qiu Renzong, an
expert from the Committee of Social, Ethical and Legal Problems of
the Human Genome Project in China.
</P>
<P>
Qiu also disagreed with the concept that all diseases and human
behavior are decided by genes. He said that some diseases are
caused by social and environmental factors, and a person should be
responsible for his or her behavior instead of blaming genes for
everything.
</P>
<P>
He said that human genome technology should not be used in "
eugenics", which can easily cause inequality among human beings.
</P>
<P>
All the scientists and experts who attended the forum agreed
that the ethical issue in human genome study needs fuller
discussion, so that the research will be guided to develop in the
right way.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Project Set to Explore New Strategies for New Delta Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and neighboring Pearl
River Delta region should maximize their advantages and develop as
partners rather than competitors, a seminar on building a
competitive Pearl River Delta region here was told Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and the Delta region should explore new strategies
that enable them to leverage a total package of each other's
advantages, said Victor Fung when delivering a keynote speech at
the seminar, which was jointly organized the Center of Urban
Planning and Environment Management, the University of Hong Kong
and Hong Kong Institute of Planners.
</P>
<P>
Fung is spearheading a private-sector initiative entitled "
Project 2022" aiming to foster greater understanding of existing
and potential linkage between Hong Kong and the delta, especially
in areas such as the environment, transportation and planning.
</P>
<P>
The project, sponsored by a group of Hong Kong business people
and thus entitled to mark the half-way point for Hong Kong's
mandated 50 years as a special administrative region, explores
specific ways of cooperation and coordination to improve
competitiveness for the delta region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 participants from government, private sector, NGO and
academics in Hong Kong, China's mainland and overseas gathered to
discuss the environment, sustainable development, infrastructure,
cross-border planning, trade, commerce and science and technology
development that are vital to the development of the region.
</P>
<P>
Participants believed that after two remarkable decades of
partnership and growth, Hong Kong and the delta region stand at a
new threshold of opportunity, and three positive trends, namely
China's impending entry into the WTO, Asia's economic recovery and
the Internet revolution, are taking root simultaneously in Asia.
</P>
<P>
They said that these developments herald vastly expanding
possibilities for economic cooperation between Hong Kong and the
delta on many levels and across many sectors, including the "new
economy."
</P>
<P>
Experts involved in the project are also urged to think of Hong
Kong and the delta not as two economic areas each pursuing their
own agenda but as one economic region with a holistic vision of
its future.
</P>
<P>
Dong Hong, director of the development research center of
Guangdong Province, said that the province's development has to
rely on the support of Hong Kong and Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability also have to rely on the province's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The synergy of the two in resources, capital, technology and
manpower will make the region to be the most dynamic and
competitive economic region in the Asia-Pacific region and the
world," Dong noted.
</P>
<P>
Largely on the strength of economic collaboration with the
delta in the past 22 years, Hong Kong rose from the 23rd to 10th
place in the world trading entities from 1978 to 1999 with the per
capita GDP soaring 10 fold to 180,000 Hong Kong dollars (23,000 U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The delta region, meanwhile, has become one of the mainland's
wealthiest, with annual per capita disposable income in Guangdong
reaching 9,000 yuan (about 1,100 U.S. dollars), some 55 percent
more than the national average.

<HEADLINE> NPC Should Carry Out Jiang's Directives: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng said
here today that the National People's Congress (NPC) should
earnestly carry out the directives made recently by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Jiang has stressed on many occasions that the Communist Party
of China should always spearhead the development requirements of
China's advanced social productive forces, the progressive course
of China's advanced culture and the fundamental interests of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The NPC, which is China's top legislative body, must have a
thorough understanding of Jiang's directives and carry them out in
its work, said Li, chairman of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative for the NPC to strengthen its legislation and
supervision work, produce laws aimed at protecting and promoting
the development of the advanced social productive forces and the
progressive course of China's advanced culture, and make the laws
truly reflect the fundamental interests of the people.
</P>
<P>
At today's closing session of the NPC's 16th meeting, Li also
stressed that the NPC must fully implement the law legislation,
which came into effect July 1.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Seaweed Industry Loses 23mln U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' seaweed industry
lost more than one billion pesos (about 23 million U.S. dollars)
in trade opportunities during the past three years, according to a
report of the Philippine News Agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The losses were blamed on the poor quality seaweeds supplied by
growers and traders from the central and southern regions of
Visayas and Mindanao, traditional sources of Euchema seaweeds.
</P>
<P>
The seaweeds are used as raw materials in the production of
export-quality carrageenan, a powdery substance used as a gelling
agent in thousands of processed foods, cosmetics, etc. in the
world's markets.
</P>
<P>
The report said the quality of seaweeds had been deteriorating
over the past three years due mainly to the high moisture content
of dried seaweeds being supplied by Visayas and Mindanao traders
and growers.
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be deliberate adulteration of seaweeds with
salt and lime to make them look dry and heavier even when they're
still wet," Benson Dakay, president of the Seaweed Industry
Association of the Philippines, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
With seemingly "heavier and dryer" seaweeds, some of these
suppliers were getting much bigger revenues than they deserved
since they are all paid by the weight, he said.
</P>
<P>
Seaweed processors had been suffering from lower yields for
every metric ton of dried seaweeds they bought from suppliers in
the South, he said, adding that yields for every metric ton they
bought had fallen from 28-20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is presently the world's largest supplier of
seaweeds and producer of carrageenan, controlling a major share of
the 300 million-U.S.-dollar global markets covering America,
Europe and Asia.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Still to Seek Special Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
made it clear Saturday that he will pursue his intention to seek
extraordinary, but limited, economic powers to speed up
rehabilitation efforts in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that he will proceed with the
implementation of development projects in the once-neglected
southern island, "with or without these powers."
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to some reports published today, I would like to make
it clear that I am not backing down in my intention to seek
extraordinary powers from Congress to fast-track rehabilitation
efforts and the implementation of development projects in Mindanao,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said the president appeared to retreat from
seeking special emergency powers to rehabilitate Mindanao in face
of strong opposition from the Congress.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly told Palace reporters on Friday that "if they don
't want it, I don't want it either. It's not that important to me,
" alluding to a proposed Mindanao Crisis Act of 2000 granting
emergency powers to the government.
</P>
<P>
Several senators and congressmen argued that there was no need
for emergency powers as the president could use the powers already
available to him.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in the statement that his "determination to
transform Mindanao into the country's next food basket and uplift
the lives of its people remain strong."
</P>
<P>
"As I have said, nobody can stop me from giving my full
attention to the development of Mindanao," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also stressed that projects covered by the proposed
special powers measure now being studied by the government would
undergo public bidding through the electronic billboard system,
which will help promote transparency and eliminate graft in the
award of contracts for the projects.
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to stress that proposed special powers
measure now under study by Malacanang (the Presidential Palace)
will rule out negotiated contracts for projects in Mindanao," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I have already stated that the government will still conduct
public biddings as part of the process in the awarding of these
projects. But in order to speed up their implementation, we will
push for the adoption of the electronic billboard system in the
public bidding of these projects. This state-of-the art system
will ensure that government transactions involving Mindanao
projects remain transparent and graft-free," he added.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Encourage Learning Beyond Classroom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, joined an education
expo Saturday and heard experiences shared among schools and
social service agencies in encouraging learning beyond the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that education aimed at helping students develop
their potential fully and attain all-round development. An
effective way to achieve this was to provide students with
diversified and enlightening learning experiences.
</P>
<P>
The "Expo on the Partnership for the Promotion of Life-wide
Learning", organized by the Education Commission, provided a forum
for schools and social service agencies and uniformed groups to
exchange views and experiences, discuss cooperation plans and
establish partnership to promote life-wide learning.
</P>
<P>
Tung commended schools and social service agencies for their
good work in offering opportunities for life-wide learning and
encouraged them to continue to develop a long-lasting partnership
for the benefit of students.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive said that it was their target to provide
quality education in Hong Kong because in the next century
knowledge-based economies would take the lead in the world. It was
imperative that their education system kept pace with the times.
</P>
<P>
He added that teaching was a highly respected profession. We
should give support and encouragement to teachers for their hard
work and contribution.
</P>
<P>
On arrival at the expo, Tung first visited stalls set up by
social service agencies, including the Red Cross, girl guides and
air cadets, to introduce their programs for young people.
</P>
<P>
To wind up his visit, the Chief Executive took part in an
experience sharing session where participants exchanged views on
teaching practices and successful experiences.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Supports Statement of "Shanghai Five" Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government fully
supports the joint statement of the "Shanghai Five" nations at
their latest summit in Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan, the
Yugoslav Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Dushanbe Statement contains principles that are of great
importance to maintaining the world peace, the ministry said.
These principles include democratizing international relations,
defending state sovereignty and territorial integrity under the U.
N. Charter, and opposing interference in other countries' internal
affairs under the pretext of "checking humanitarian disasters" and
"protecting human rights."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government sees special significance in the strong
condemnation by the five heads of state of NATO's barbarous
aggression of Yugoslavia last year in violation of the U.N.
Charter and international law, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government firmly believes that an overwhelming
majority of the countries in the world will support the principled
stance against hegemonism and power politics affirmed in the
Dushanbe Statement, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of China, Tajikistan, Russia, Kazakhstan and
Kyrgyzstan attended the one-day meeting in Dushanbe last Wednesday,
commonly known as the "Shanghai Five" summit, that has been held
annually since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Firm State Rule, Free Economy in State of Nation Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
made his first state of the nation address to the parliament
Saturday, in which he stressed strong central authority and an
open economy as a cure for the country.
</P>
<P>
"The state power's indecisiveness and weakness bring our
economic and other reforms to nothing. The power must lean on law
and the single executive vertical system," Putin told the Federal
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"A national idea is already ripening in our society. Despite
the variety of political parties in the country, we have always
had common goals which unite us and help us be a single people,"
Putin said, noting that "real federative relations have not yet
been fully built and developed in Russia."
</P>
<P>
"We do not yet have a proper federative state," said the
president, urging all branches of the state authority to "stop
vying for powers" and to "pass over to cooperation in tackling
national problems."
</P>
<P>
On the country's economy, Putin said he regards the state's
inefficiency as the main reason behind the protracted economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"A state's excessive intrusion in spheres where it must not be
and lack of attention where it is necessary" is observed in Russia,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The president described high taxes, officials' arbitrariness
and an outburst of crime as the main barriers for economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"The economy's orientation towards raw-material still remains,"
which depends on the state of the market, and "a considerable part
of our economy is still in the shadows," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The particular problem is the burden of foreign debt, which "
poses a threat to the state. At least a third of the state budget
revenues are spent on "servicing and clearing debts," the
president remarked.
</P>
<P>
The key role of the state in economy consists in protecting
economic freedom. "The essence of state regulation of the economy
is not the state's expansion into different spheres or support for
the chosen ones, but the protection of private initiatives of all
forms of ownership," Putin emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He called for "curbing all attempts to limit economic freedom
in the provinces as unconstitutional."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Cooperates With Greece in British Diplomat Murder Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Intelligence (KYP) is helping
Greece hunt for the suspects in the assassination of the British
military attache in Athens last month, local media reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Saunders, 53, military attache of the British embassy to
Greece, was shot dead on June 8 when he was driving to work on a
busy Athens street.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the murder, Greek media published a list of names of
alleged members, some of them Cypriots, of the terrorist group
called November 17 which has claimed responsibility for the
assassination.
</P>
<P>
The Greek secret service requested its Cypriot counterpart that
evidence be collected on the belief that Greek Cypriots belonging
to the elusive November 17 organization could be hiding on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Greek intelligence chief Pavlos Apostolides recently visited the
island looking for clues in the murder investigation.
</P>
<P>
Saunders, who had a local connection as he had previously served
in Cyprus, was the 23rd victim murdered by the November 17
terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
But no one from the November 17 group has ever been caught since
the group started its activities in 1975.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft, the U.S. software giant, Friday bowed to pressure
from the European Commission and said it would give up plans to
seek joint control of Telewest, the UK cable operator.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The International Football was in turmoil Friday as the New
Zealander whose abstention in the voting handed Germany the 2006
World Cup returned home, still claiming that he had been under
intense pressure from supporters of the rival bids.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson has agreed to
incorporating the words "the Royal Ulster Constabulary" in the

concession was welcomed Friday night by Unionists and
Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government has finally agreed to take back a
shipment of flawed nuclear fuel from Japan, seven months after the

about safety checks on its reprocessed plutonium pellets.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Greenpeace activists Friday broke into a U.S. air force base

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Mark Dorm-Attack Incident Quietly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian students started the day
quietly on Saturday, holding no rallies or demonstrations to mark
the first anniversary of the Tehran University student dormitory
incident that sparked widespread riots last July.
</P>
<P>
On the streets and city squares of Tehran, the stream of cars
flow as usual, and people walk their way or wait for their buses
quietly. No student gatherings are in sight. Even the Tehran
University is in a tranquil atmosphere, with not many students in
the campus.
</P>
<P>
On July 8 last year, Tehran was the battleground of the heaviest
clashes between the security forces and protesting students after
the culmination of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran University students, in protest to the closure of an
outspoken daily by the conservative authorities, had staged a rally
on the premises of their dormitory but were raided by the police
and a number of plainclothes men.
</P>
<P>
In the heavy clash, one student died and hundreds were injured.
The incident sparked nation-wide unrest in the next five days.
</P>
<P>
Tehran University students have said that they would mark the
anniversary peacefully and avoid violence and they seem to be
keeping their word.
</P>
<P>
A leading student organization, however, issued a statement
Friday night to mark the occasion, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the Office to Foster Unity called on the
Majlis (parliament) to defend people's rights by approving the
required laws for institutionalization of democracy and realization
of the civil society.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Majlis to approve a motion filed by a number of
parliament members last month, which aims to bar police and
military forces from entering universities and research agencies.
</P>
<P>
On the trial of some 20 police officers believed to be involved
in the attack, the statement said that the trial was not enough,
for those who were behind the scene and really responsible for the
incident are still at large.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the students to exercise self-restraint and
steadfastness in facing various kinds of instigation, for any
impulsive or radical behavior may be used by the conservative
establishment to crackdown on the country's reformist movement.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Says Shares Concerns With "Shanghai Five" Over Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said it has the "same
concerns" over terrorism as China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan
and Tajikistan, the members of the "Shanghai Five," which held a
summit earlier this week in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
Ankara was not invited to attend the summit at observer level,
but its embassy in Dushanbe had followed the meeting "closely,"
Turkish diplomatic sources close to the Foreign Ministry were
quoted as saying by Turkish Daily News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the five states signed a declaration vowing to
deepen cooperation on security issues and expressed support to a
Kyrgyz proposal to set up a regional center for fighting terrorism
in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Turkey shares the same concerns as the "
Shanghai Five" nations that Central Asia and the surrounding area
are under the threat of regional and international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that although Ankara expressed its
supports for the five state's decision to fight terrorism, it
feared that Russia would enhance influence in the region where the
two countries have been historical rivals.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the Foreign Ministry had previously prepared a
report addressing Turkey's concerns over the terrorist threat in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The report said Russia was taking advantage of the terrorism in
the region to regain its dominant position in Central Asia and the
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkey has worked hard
to increase ties with Turkic-speaking countries in the Caucasus and
Central Asia, including Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgystan.
</P>
<P>
Under the promotion of the United States, Turkey, Azerbaijan and
Georgia reached last year an agreement on the construction of a
multi-billion-dollar inter-governmental oil pipeline to transport
Caspian oil from Azerbaijan to global market through Turkish ports.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the pipeline was of more political importance than
economic significance for Washington, which aims to undercut the
former Soviet republics' dependence on Russia.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Airlines Resumes Flights to Egypt After 8-Year Intermittence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A passenger plane of the Libyan
national airlines arrived in Cairo Saturday morning, the first to
land in Egypt since 1992, when international air embargo was
imposed on Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the Libyan Arab Airlines (LAA) plane, carrying 11
passengers and a delegation grouping Libyan aviation officials,
marked the resumption of regular flights between the two countries
after the suspension of the United Nations sanctions last year.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Issa, an LAA top official, said upon arrival that LAA
will make 12 return flights a week between the two countries,
including seven linking Tripoli and Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Two flights will link the Mediterranean cities of Benghazi in
Libya and Alexandria in Egypt in addition to two weekly flights
between Benghazi and Cairo and one between Cairo and Sabha, 600
kilometers south of Tripoli, Issa added.
</P>
<P>
He said Libya would welcome on Monday the first EgyptAir flight
in eight years after the Egyptian national carrier announced last
week that it will also resume its connections with Libya.
</P>
<P>
The international air embargo was suspended more than a year ago
after Libya handed over two Libyans suspected of the 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
Officials on both sides said the resumption of regular flights
had been delayed due to technical and commercial reasons.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Requires Relief Food up to December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will require relief food up
to December this year as the famine situation is desperate, the
country's Disaster Emergency Response Committee has said.
</P>
<P>
Uhuru Kenyatta, chairman of the committee, appealed here on
Friday to all Kenyans to be at the forefront to the calamity
brought about by rain failure, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyatta's appeal came hot on the heels of the World Food
Program warning that Kenya had only one month's stock of relief
food left.
</P>
<P>
David Fletcher, WFP country representative in Nairobi, said on
Wednesday that there would be no food after August to feed
millions of Kenyans affected by famine in 19 districts.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenyatta, the Italian government had responded to
Kenya's appeal by shipping 2,437 tons of food including wheat and
rice which will be distributed to the needy next week.
</P>
<P>
He said between July last year and June this year, the Kenyan
government has bought 438,217 bags of maize (90 kilograms per
bag) for distribution to famine victims.

world will gather in Durban, a South African coastal city, on July
9-14 to address the HIV/AIDS issue with an ever firmer
determination to contain the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The official opening of the 13th World AIDS Conference at
Kingsmead cricket stadium in Durban on Sunday night will be
watched live in 70 countries across the globe, the organizers
said.
</P>
<P>
But will the conference prove effective in reining in the
rampant spread of AIDS that has already claimed 18.8 million
people since the first AIDS patient was diagnosed in the United
States in 1981?
</P>
<P>
A U.N. report, released days before the conference, revealed
that last year 5.4 million people globally were infected with the
virus bringing the number of those living with the disease to 34.3
million.
</P>
<P>
Africa has the largest number of AIDS sufferers -- 25 million,
with sub- Saharan African region registering the bulk of the
number -- about 24 million. South Africa alone has 4.2 million
sufferers, the largest number in the world.
</P>
<P>
About half of the adult Africans living with HIV are aged
between 15 and 34, at least three-quarters are in the prime of
their economically productive and childbearing life.
</P>
<P>
The disease's ultimate toll on the region is likely to be far
more severe than what is evident today, experts warned.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma, while
it is scientifically accepted that HIV/AIDS knows no social,
gender or racial boundaries, it is a fact that the virus is to be
found in greater concentration among the poorer sections of
society.
</P>
<P>
It is true that AIDS and poverty are synonymous and because of
the disease, poverty is getting worse just as the need for more
resources to curb the spread of HIV and alleviate the epidemic's
impact on development grows.
</P>
<P>
Thus the call for more international aid to alleviate Africa's
poverty is growing stronger.
</P>
<P>
"It's time to make the connection between debt relief and
epidemic relief," the U.N. report said.
</P>
<P>
African governments are paying out four times more in debt
service than they now spend on health and education, the report
said, urging the international community to relieve some of
Africa's external debt so as to allow these countries to reinvest
the savings in poverty alleviation and AIDS prevention and care.
</P>
<P>
"If not, poverty will just continue to fan the flames of the
epidemic," the report warned.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS, a U.N. anti-AIDS agency, estimated that 1.6 billion to
2.6 billion U.S. dollars would be required to create a "package"
for Africa that would focus on limited use of antiviral drugs to
prevent mother-to- child transmission of the virus, and treatment
of tuberculosis and other infections complicating AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, wealthy countries have become apparently more
concerned with the plight of epidemic-ravaged countries, partly
because the latter may pose threats to global social stability.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, several drug companies have committed
themselves to cutting the price of AIDS drugs in the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Al Gore proposed earlier this year an
increase of 100 million dollars in the U.S. contribution to
anti-AIDS efforts in developing countries to a total of 325
million.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. survey released last month found that two-thirds of
Americans support using federal funds to help address the AIDs
epidemic in Africa, with one-third "strongly" supporting the idea.
</P>
<P>
International assistance is very important for Africa in
fighting AIDS. Meanwhile, some African countries have begun to
find a solution of their own.
</P>
<P>
"Here in our own continent we are seeing we need an African
solution to the problem," Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
Confronted with the great challenge, African countries are
intensifying their campaign and have achieved good results.
</P>
<P>
Senegal managed to intervene early in the course of its HIV
epidemic, maintaining one of the lowest infection rates in
sub-Saharan Africa through effective intervention and emphasis on
prevention. Less than 2 percent of adults are believed to be
infected in the country.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, the disease's prevalence has fallen from 14 percent
to 8 percent thanks to the prevention campaigns and care. In
Lusaka, Zambia, the percentage of pregnant teenagers infected with
HIV has dropped by half in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
In some places, condom use is becoming the norm among sexually
active teenagers and more teenagers are delaying the age of first
intercourse.
</P>
<P>
The anti-AIDS struggle is uphill, but there are reasons for
optimism as demonstrated by the successful examples above.
</P>
<P>
"Our fight must be relentless, and our efforts doubled" to make
the goal of a safe and secure Africa a reality, Zuma said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Failure of U.S. ABM Test Shows NMD Unfeasible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian military official said
Saturday that the failure of the third anti-ballistic missile (ABM)
test conducted by the U.S. Friday night has proved Washington's
plans to deploy a national missile defense (NMD) system to be "
unfeasible and impossible."
</P>
<P>
"Another failure of an interceptor missile test carried out by
the Pentagon last night yet again shows that the idea of setting
up a national anti-ballistic missile system is highly disputable
both from military, political and technical points of view," the
Interfax news agency cited Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, chief
of the Russian Defense Ministry's Main Department for
International Cooperation, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will always be able to defeat any U.S. ABM system,"
Ivashov said. "The only question is whether it is worth investing
such significant amounts money in this scheme while it could be
resolved by political means," the general stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Both Russian and American professionals in the ABM sphere are
perfectly aware that it is impossible to create a system of
absolute protection," Ivashov remarked.
</P>
<P>
The general again noted extremely negative consequences in case
the U.S. president should take the decision to deploy a national
ABM system. This may lead to the breakdown of the process of
nuclear weapons reduction and the destabilization of strategic
balance and a nuclear deterrence regime, he said.
</P>
<P>
In this case, "(U.S. President) Bill Clinton would hand down a
not very favorable legacy in the sphere of strategic stability to
the next U.S. administration," Ivashov concluded.

<HEADLINE> State Council Stresses Production Safety (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following the severe shipwreck accident in Yantai on November
24 last year which killed over 100 and the deadly explosion in a
firecracker factory in Jiangxi Province on March 11 this year, the
State Council held national teleconferences in December last year
and in April this year calling for doing a good job of production
safety.
</P>
<P>
Despite considerable progress, China faces a "grim situation"
in ensuring production safety, the circular warned.
</P>
<P>
This summer, a string of new, major accidents have occurred,
resulting in heavy casualties and property damage, it said,
attributing the causes of the accidents mainly to poor
implementation of safety precautions and related officials'
neglect of duty.
</P>
<P>
Focuses of the upcoming nationwide safety check-up will also be
placed on enterprises producing boilers, pressure vessels and
elevators, and those managing cableways. Safety in public places,
including schools, gyms, hospitals, shopping malls, bus terminals,
ports, and recreational facilities, scenic spots and hotels will
also be a priority.
</P>
<P>
The circular said those fireworks manufacturers, lighter plants
and small oil refineries that fail to meet safety requirements
will be ordered to move out of urban areas or shut down during the
check-up.

<HEADLINE> State Council Stresses Production Safety (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The General Office of the State
Council, China's highest governing body, issued an urgent circular
today, ordering local governments and related departments to take
stricter, immediate measures to ensure industrial safety.
</P>
<P>
The circular came in the wake of several severe accidents,
including the June 22 shipwreck in southwest China's Sichuan
Province which claimed 130 lives and a bus plunge in southern
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that killed at least 31 people
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The circular called for immediately conducting a thorough
investigation into production safety and checking safety loopholes.
Priority should be given to such areas as transport, coal, power,
petro-chemicals and construction, as well as enterprises
manufacturing fireworks and poisonous and dangerous products.
</P>
<P>
The results of the investigation should be reported to the
office before the end of July, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, severe punishment will be given to
those directly responsible for major safety-related accidents in
accordance with the law. Leading officials of the localities,
departments or units where major accidents occur will be held
responsible and punished. And departments of supervision and law
enforcement whose dereliction of duty and abuse of power lead to
the occurrence of accidents will be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission will take charge of
supervising production safety, the circular said, asking all
related departments to coordinate in the investigation of major
safety-related cases.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed the importance of promoting publicity on
industrial safety measures and regulations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Production safety is of great importance and has drawn the
concerns of President Jiang Zemin and other top leaders, the
circular said, urging all localities and departments concerned to
take effective measures to curb the occurrence of major accidents.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Claims Nine Lives in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A week-long intense heat wave has
claimed nine lives across Turkey so far, reported Turkish Daily
News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to meteorology bulletins, Turkey is experiencing its
hottest July in some 60 years.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the week, temperatures have sprung up
rapidly. Average daytime temperatures soared from about 37 degrees
Celsius to 45.6 degrees Celsius Friday. The highest temperature was
registered at 48.5 degrees Celsius in Cizre of Sirnak province,
adjacent to Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Halil Ergen, aged 59, died of an asthma attack as a result of
the high temperature in his hotel room in the southern
Mediterranean city of Antalya.
</P>
<P>
To the east of Antalya, two soldiers trying to cool themselves
down under the scorching sun were drowned while wading into the
Dicle River.
</P>
<P>
In the southeastern province of Batman and the Eskisehir
province in the west of Ankara, six people were found dead
apparently due to the high temperature.
</P>
<P>
The number of people seeking medical help has also sharply
increased. Turkish Heart Foundation Chairman Cetin Yildirim Akin
said that scorching heat and high humidity had heightened the risk
of heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
Animals are also affected by the heat. Camel drivers soaked
their animals in an effort to cool them down after temperatures hit
45 degrees Celsius, while in northwest Turkey 5,200 chickens were
killed by the heat.

preparing realistic and detailed programs within three months to
implement a national program for modernizing all sectors of
national action.
</P>
<P>
All agricultural, industrial, financial, banking and service

<HEADLINE> Military in Full Offensive Against Moro Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Government troops are now on the
second stage of their offensive to capture the headquarters of the
secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 soldiers have been deployed to take Camp Abubakar,
the last remaining MILF stronghold in the province of Maguindanao
in Mindanao, according to a report of the Philippine news agency
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They are supported by dozens of armored vehicles, Howitzers,
bomber aircraft and attack helicopters, the report added.
</P>
<P>
"We are inching our way to our objective," Capt. Noel Detoyato,
spokesman of the 6th Infantry Division of the Philippine Army, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Detoyato said government forces seized two more MILF satellite
camps on Friday in the town of Barira in Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
Although it is hard to set a time frame for the capture of Camp
Abubakar, combined Army and Marine forces will try their best to
take the sprawling 10,000-hectare base in a week' time, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Detoyato admitted that it will not be an easy task to
capture Abubukar since MILF rebels have fortified their camp with
concrete bunkers and running trenches.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Air Force light bombers and helicopter gunships
alternately conduct daily airstrikes on rebel positions to soften
the defenses around Camp Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada ordered the military on Friday to
arrest top MILF leaders once Camp Abubakar is overrun.
</P>
<P>
"They (MILF leaders) are the enemy," he said. "They should be
captured because they are challenging the sovereignty of this
country."
</P>
<P>
The military began launching attacks on Camp Abubakar after the
MILF failed to meet a June 30 deadline set by President Estrada to
sign a peace deal with the government and rejected government
demands to abandon its bid for independence and stop terrorist
acts.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has earlier threatened to retaliate if the government
forces continue to attack Camp Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been fighting for two decades for an independent
Islamic state in Mindanao. Conflicts between government troops and
MILF rebels have reportedly displaced at least 500,000 civilians
since late April when the military launched attacks on rebel
encampments along the Narciso Ramos Highway in Maguindanao.

LUSAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has launched
the Education Broadcasting Service (EBS) to ensure children obtain
free education through the radio, the Times of Zambia newspaper
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The system would ensure as many children as possible to get
free education, Education Minister Godfrey Miyanda was quoted as

</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that children, especially those in rural
areas, would obtain basic education through EBS.
</P>

Meanwhile, EBS controller Faustina Sinyangwe said that the
Education Ministry had already installed the broadcasting
facilities and would next week conduct training workshops for the
first 12 mentors selected from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Broadcasts would begin with lessons in English and mathematics
and examinations based on the same lessons at various levels would

<HEADLINE> Union for Agro-Professionals Formed in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A trade union to look into the
interests of all technical and professional employees in the field
of agriculture has been formed in Zambia, the Zambia Daily Mail
newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The union, which is called Agriculture Technical and
Professional Staff Union, will look forward to negotiating with
the government and other stakeholders to improve the salaries and
conditions of service for all agriculture technical and
professional staff, said the union's interim president Sam Lungu
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said any initiative to improve the agriculture sector in the
country should take into account the welfare of professional staff
because they are the forerunners of the implementation process.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, as a key sector in the development of the country,
should have a well motivated workforce because technical and
professional advice is cardinal for the planning, organization and
implementation of any program, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lungu, one of the reasons for the poor performance
of the Agriculture Sub-sector Investment Program is lack of
consultation by the government and donors with the implementing
staff.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, farmers are already urging the union to embark on
road development in rural areas as the roads in disrepair have
been an hindrance to free crop marketing by small-scale farmers.
</P>
<P>
Most farmers had no option but to sell their crop at give-away
prices because of lack of access to market.

<HEADLINE> WHO Lauds Uganda's Malaria Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has praised Uganda for taking the lead in Africa in the fight
against malaria by waiving taxes and tariffs on mosquito nets and
insecticides, the New Vision daily reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
More Ugandans will now be able to afford nets and insecticides,
the " essential tools for protection against the disease that
kills more than 1 million people worldwide every year," said Wash
Teklehaimanot, acting Project Manage of Roll Back Malaria (RBM).
</P>
<P>
"Uganda has set the pace and we need to see other African
nations follow this excellent example," he said.
</P>
<P>
RBM is a global partnership of United Nations agencies,
governments and non-governmental organizations committed to
reduce malaria-caused death toll in the world.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's move is the first following a series of "hard hitting
pledges" made by African presidents at the African Malaria Summit
in Abuja, Nigeria in April this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At the Abuja summit, African nations developed a plan to
accelerate the fight against malaria and pledged to reduce or
waive taxes and tariffs on all equipment used in malaria control.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fails to Hit Target in Anti-Missile Test EDS-Updates with more details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. interceptor missile
failed to hit a speeding target warhead in space in a 100-million-
U.S.-dollar test of the proposed National Missile Defense (NMD)
system early Saturday, the Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
"We failed to achieve an intercept," said Pentagon spokesman
Bryan Whitman in a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We did not intercept the warhead. We are disappointed," said
Ronald Kadish, director of the Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization of the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
Kadish said that because the "kill vehicle" did not detach from
the booster, it never activated the on-board sensors and other
high-tech devices that it would use to intercept the warhead.
</P>
<P>
The "kill vehicle" apparently did not separate from the booster
missile because it did not receive a necessary electronic signal,
he said, adding that it might take days for the Defense Department
to understand why the internal booster signal was not received.
</P>
<P>
The failure is an apparent setback in the Pentagon's drive to
develop the NMD.
</P>
<P>
After fixing a last-minute technical glitch that delayed the
start of Saturday's test by about two hours, a modified Minuteman
intercontinental ballistic missile with a dummy warhead atop its
third stage rocket blasted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base,
California State, at 12:19 a.m. EDT (0419 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one minutes later, at 12:40 a.m. EDT (0440 GMT), an
interceptor missile carrying a warhead-blasting "kill vehicle" was
launched from Kwajalein Atoll on the Marshall Islands.
</P>
<P>
The interceptor was supposed to have collided with the mock
warhead after about 10 minutes of flight over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
This was the third test of the intercept program. The first
such test last October was successful, although there was a
problem with finding the approaching warhead. A second such test
failed early this year.
</P>
<P>
The next attempted test is scheduled for this fall, but that
timetable might now be put back, according to Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
If Saturday's test had succeeded, it could have moved the
United States a step closer to building the NMD which Congress
says is urgently needed, but which critics decry as unworkable.
</P>
<P>
The anti-missile system is designed to provide protection for
all 50 U.S. states against ballistic missile attacks from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
A base with 20 interceptor missiles would be built in Alaska
State, along with a new radar to help guide the missiles to their
target. By 2007, under the current schedule, the system would be
expanded to 100 interceptor missiles. The Pentagon estimates the
cost at 36 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. NMD, opposed by the
international community, will not only spark a new arms race, but
also threaten security and stimulate nuclear proliferation,
instead of promoting security and stemming the spread of nuclear
weapons.

FUZHOU, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A frontier police force in east
China's Fujian Province has saved five Taiwan fisherman after
their docked boat caught fire.
</P>
<P>
Fire broke out on the boat, which was anchored at a port in
Zhaoan county in the province, at about 10 p.m. on July 3.
</P>
<P>
The fire originated when sparks caused by a short circuit in a
cabin ignited styrofoam stored on the boat, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Thick smoke billowed from the cabin at the front part of the
boat, and tongues of fire threatened dozens of wooden boat nearby.
</P>
<P>
Frontier police in the city of Fuzhou rushed to the scene and
extinguished the fire after more than one hour.
</P>

They saved five fishermen on board, and the boat worth 2
million yuan (about 250,000 U.S. dollars) was not badly damaged.

<HEADLINE> First Iraqi-Built Oil Refinery to be in Operation Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The first locally-constructed oil
refinery in Iraq, with a capacity of 10,000 barrels a day, is
expected to go into operation in the next few days, the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Citing an official at the Ministry of Industry and Minerals, the
INA said the oil refinery is located in Baiji area, some 200
kilometers north of the capital Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The success of building small oil refineries will encourage Iraq
to build big ones to break foreign monopoly in this field, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
The oil refinery is one of the 12 oil refineries, each with a
capacity of 10,000 barrels a day, to be built by joint teams from
the Iraqi Military Industry Commission and the Ministry of Industry
and Minerals.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been making efforts to improve its oil facilities,
which have become dilapidated as a result of the 1991 Gulf War and
the decade-old United Nations sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the United States and British delegates at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee for blocking contracts it signed with
foreign countries to import oil equipment and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
During the fifth, sixth and seventh phase of the U.N. oil-for-
food program, Iraq signed contracts worth 1.5 billion U.S. dollars
with foreign countries to rehabilitate its oil industry, but only
770 million dollars worth of contracts were approved.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to sell limited amount of
oil to buy basic goods in an exemption to the stringent sanctions
imposed on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's current production is 3.1 million barrels a day, of which
600,000 barrels are consumed domestically and 2.5 million barrels
are for exports.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Farmers Reduce Hectarage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's commercial tobacco
farmers have reduced irrigated tobacco area for the current season
from 32,000 to 28,000 hectares owing to the problems surrounding
the land acquisition program.
</P>
<P>
Kobus Joubert, president of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association
(ZTA), told the Zimbabwe News Agency on Friday that some 294
tobacco commercial farms, which represent an estimated 12,590
hectares, have been listed for acquisition.
</P>
<P>
He said the continued farm invasions by war veterans and
villagers have seriously reduced business confidence and security
among most tobacco commercial farmers.
</P>
<P>
"The government should move quickly to evict war veterans in
the interest of the tobacco industry and the economy at large,
since the farmers are working on a seasonal time constraint," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Joubert, Zimbabwean tobacco commercial farmers
planted 32, 000 hectares of seedbed last year, but this year they
have only managed to plant about 28,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
"War veterans have disturbed business by causing work stoppages
and land has not been pegged," he said.
</P>
<P>
The former freedom fighters have occupied about 1,500 white
farms since February this year to pressure the government to speed
up land reform.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, the United States and Brazil produce the best tobacco
in the world and tobacco is Zimbabwe's single largest foreign
currency earner.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Treasury Secretary Renews Call on Japan to Spur Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers on Saturday renewed a call for Japan's continued
simulative efforts to fortify its budding economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
In a 45-minute meeting in Fukuoka, southwestern Japan, Summers
told Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that monetary,
fiscal and structural policies are the key to returning Japan's
economy back to health, the Kyodo News Services reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Summers urged Japan to redouble efforts to
achieve recovery led by expansion of domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
"The achievement of sustained domestic demand-led growth is an
absolute, crucial priority for Japan," he said, "We believe that
it is appropriate that the Japanese government continue to
maintain that priority."
</P>
<P>
His remarks are regarded as urging the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to
maintain its hyper-easy monetary policy as speculation mounts that
the central bank will decide to abandon the policy soon.
</P>
<P>
The BOJ has maintained the policy of guiding the unsecured
money rate to around zero since February last year.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa did not divulge his own opinion on the BOJ's monetary
policy stance and told Summers that monetary policy is the central
bank's prerogative, Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese finance minister explained the state of Japan's
economy in detail, citing a sharp upturn in gross domestic product
in the January-March quarter and weak personal spending.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa and Summers met just prior to the beginning of a
meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G-7)
industrial nations in Fukuoka, Japan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fails to Hit Target in Anti-Missile Test EDS-Updates with more information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. interceptor missile
failed to hit a speeding target warhead in space in the third test
of the proposed National Missile Defense (NMD) system early
Saturday, the Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
The failure raised the possibility of a substantial delay in
the Pentagon's timetable of having the NMD system ready for use by
the end of 2005.
</P>
<P>
"We failed to achieve an intercept," said Pentagon spokesman
Bryan Whitman. Details were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
After fixing a last-minute technical glitch that delayed the
start of the test by about two hours, a modified Minuteman
intercontinental ballistic missile with a dummy warhead atop its
third stage rocket blasted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base,
California State, at 12:19 a.m. EDT (0419 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one minutes later, at 12:40 a.m. EDT (0440 GMT), an
interceptor missile carrying a warhead-blasting "kill vehicle" was
launched from Kwajalein Atoll on the Marshall Islands.
</P>
<P>
The interceptor was supposed to have collided with the mock
warhead after about 10 minutes of flight over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The first such test last October was successful, although there
was a problem with finding the approaching warhead. A second such
test failed early this year.
</P>
<P>
The next attempted test is scheduled for this fall, according
to Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
If Saturday's test had succeeded, it could have moved the
United States a step closer to building the NMD which Congress
says is urgently needed, but which critics decry as unworkable.
</P>
<P>
The anti-missile system is designed to provide protection for
all 50 U.S. states against ballistic missile attacks. A base with
20 interceptor missiles would be built in Alaska State, along with
a new radar to help guide the missiles to their target. By 2007,
under the current schedule, the system would be expanded to 100
interceptor missiles. The Pentagon estimates the cost at 36
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. NMD, opposed by the
international community, will not only spark a new arms race, but
also threaten security and stimulate nuclear proliferation,
instead of promoting security and stemming the spread of nuclear
weapons.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Internet is still a man's
world in many countries around the globe as far as Web surfers are
concerned, said a new audience report Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although women Web surfers in the United States have achieved
better-than-parity with the men, the demographic split remains
heavily weighted toward males in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand,
Singapore and the United Kingdom, according to U.S. Web
measurement service Nielsen/NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Internet audience is slightly weighted toward females,
who represented 50.8 percent of the activity in May, while males
represented 49.2 percent of the overall audience.
</P>
<P>
The widest gender gap was seen in the UK, where almost 61
percent of the May audience was male. In Singapore, females
accounted for only 44.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to NetRatings, the demographic split in the Internet
audience in the U.S. has evened out over the past 18 months. The
female audience is primarily visiting shopping sites, home sites
or general interest sites. In other countries, female audience are
still searching for sites they can visit and re-visit for
information pertinent to their daily lives.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Small Industry Sector Fails to Attract Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's small and cottage
industry sector has miserably failed to achieve its target to
attract investment for the 1999-2000 fiscal year, the Financial
Express reported here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It had neither reached its target to develop entrepreneurship
nor even touched the target for generation of employment and the
setting up of new industrial units in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC)
set a target for registration of 6,640 new small and cottage
industrial units across the country in the last fiscal year,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, it had been able to enlist about 2,897 industrial
units in the first three quarters of the last fiscal year. The
percentage of the achievement is 43 against its stipulated target
of 75 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
The BSCIC fixed a target to develop about 34,622 entrepreneurs
at small and cottage industry level throughout the country, but it
was able to develop only 19,251 in the last nine months, achieving
merely 56 percent of the target.
</P>
<P>
The BSCIC's poorest performance was in the field of employment
generation. It has employed about 42,051 people during the nine-
month period in small and cottage industry sector against its
annual target of employment set at 172,684 people, attaining a
success of a meager 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Survey of Bangladesh, a publication of the
Ministry of Finance, also presented a gloomy picture of the
country's small and cottage industry sector by revealing that the
sector achieved only four percent growth in the last fiscal year
against 8.3 percent growth in the fiscal year 95-96.

<HEADLINE> Rubber Producers Agree to Lift Falling Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The world's three largest rubber
producers, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, have agreed to join
forces to combat falling rubber prices.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was made during a meeting between the countries'
ministers of trade and industry here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued following the meeting, the
ministers agreed on the need to take concrete measures to improve
the sluggish rubber market.
</P>
<P>
No details of the cooperation plan were available, but the
ministers expected a concrete action plan could be hammered out
during a forthcoming meeting in Thailand in September.
</P>
<P>
"We (Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia) control 80 percent of
the world's rubber market, but we don't have any power to control
the prices," Minister of Industry and Trade Luhut Panjaitan was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
International rubber prices had plunged to 0.60 U.S. dollar per
kilogram from 1.2 U.S. dollars per kilogram in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of our rubber farmers, we must find ways to raise
rubber prices above 1 (one) U.S. dollar," he added.
</P>
<P>
As a first step toward this end, Thailand and Malaysia signed a
joint venture agreement during the meeting to purchase 140,000
metric tons of rubber held by the now defunct international
natural rubber organization (INRO).
</P>
<P>
But Indonesia said it could not join the venture, due to a lack
of funds. Indonesia might join the joint venture at a later date,
Panjaitan said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Jakarta was the first time ministers from the
three countries had discussed forming a buffer stock to replace
INRO. Trade officials have been discussing the idea since last
year.
</P>
<P>
The nineteen-year-old INRO ceased to exist late last year,
following Malaysia and Thailand's decision to withdraw from the
organization after having concluded it had failed to stabilize
rubber prices.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have since tried to persuade Indonesia to join
them in a pact to support declining rubber prices and purchase the
remaining buffer stock.

WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States launched a
missile carrying a dummy warhead in a key National Missile Defense
(NMD) system test early Saturday, the Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
A modified Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile lifted
off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California State at 0.18 a.m.
EDT (0418 GMT) and thrust its target payload toward the Marshall
Islands on the Pacific 6,880 kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
The missile, which lifted off shortly after midnight, headed
toward the central Pacific, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
Within 20 minutes of liftoff, an interceptor missile carrying a
warhead-blasting "kill vehicle" was to launch from Kwajalein Atoll
on the Marshall Islands in an attempt to track, intercept and
smash into the approaching warhead in space high above the Pacific

<HEADLINE> G-7 Finance Ministers Meeting Opens in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers from the Group of
Seven (G-7) most industrialized nations on Saturday opened their
meeting in Fukuoka, southwestern Japan, to discuss ways to
maximize the benefits of the information technology (IT)
revolution around the globe, the Kyodo news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers are also expected to discuss issues
pertaining to debt-relief measures for heavily indebted poor
countries, ways to reform the International Monetary Fund, and
ways to crack down on tax evasion and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the finance chiefs from the G-7 -- Britain,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, will
lay the groundwork for a summit of Group of Eight (G-8) nations in
Okinawa later this month.
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's talks, the finance ministers will for the first
time hold in-depth discussions on effects of the IT revolution on
macroeconomic, financial and tax policies.
</P>
<P>
They are poised to agree on the importance of setting
internationally coordinated rules and regulations in these spheres,
Kyodo quoted G-7 sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 ministers are also likely to agree that national
regulatory and supervisory authorities should cooperate in
overseeing e-commerce,they said.
</P>
<P>
Taxing e-commerce is another major topic for discussion. The
ministers are expected to discuss problems arising from patenting
new ways of doing business, such as e-commerce marketing.
</P>
<P>
IT-related issues will also figure prominently at the G-8
summit to be held on the southernmost island of Okinawa July 21-23.
The G-8 is the G-7 plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
As for IMF reform, the G-7 ministers are to adopt a package of
proposals that will strengthen the Washington-based IMF's crisis-
prevention functions and discourage long-term repeat borrowing, an
international financial source said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Colorado Wildfire 30 Percent Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal official said
Friday that firefighters had contained 30 percent of a wildfire in
Buster Flats, a remote section of northwest Colorado 30 kilometers
south of the border with Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
The fire had scorched 10,050 acres since being ignited by a
lightning strike Monday, said Lynn Barclay, a member of the
federal interagency management team fighting the fire. She
predicted the fire would be fully contained by Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Ridgetop winds of 55-65 kph in recent days have made fighting
the fire difficult, Barclay said. Three to four tankers have been
dropping retardant on the fire, but the winds have blown the
retardant from its target, lessening its impact.
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle has been the rugged terrain. Many of the 220
firefighters have been ferried to the fire by helicopter, she
added.
</P>
<P>
No one has been hurt. No structures have burned, and none is
threatened, Barclay said.
</P>
<P>
Campers who were evacuated earlier in the week from Lodore
campground on Dinosaur National Monument have been allowed to
return to the camp site, she said.
</P>
<P>
Rafters along the popular Green River, who applied years ago
for their rafting permits, have been allowed to travel on the
water unimpeded, she said.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Wyoming state, two wildfires had scorched about
22,500 acres of juniper and sagebrush. No structures were
threatened but one firefighter was treated for heat stroke,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The fire season is shaping up as the worst since 1996,
according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho. It
began more than a month ago with blazes engulfing areas of Florida
and the Southwest, most notably in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
About 44,300 fires covering more than 1.2 million acres have
been recorded nationwide so far, with drought getting worse in the
West.

<HEADLINE> Vast Wildfires Burn in U.S. Alaska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 wildfires are
burning the outer areas around Fairbanks in Alaska, the state's
second-largest city, according to reports reaching here late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Visibility is down to one mile, where you can't see the hills
nearby or make out the sun," said Toivo Luick, a chemist with the
Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
The largest fire, according to officials managing the Alaska
wildfires, is the lightning-sparked 153,700-acre Zitziana blaze
burning near Manley, a village 150 kilometers west of Fairbanks.
Its southern flank was halted when it reached the burned-out
remains of a 1976 fire.
</P>
<P>
Large, lightning-ignited wildfires are typical in the summer in
interior Alaska. Summer daylight warms the area nearly around the
clock, and the wildfires are considered part of the normal forest
regeneration cycle.
</P>
<P>
As of Friday, 311 wildfires had burned nearly 584,000 acres in
Alaska this year, the Fire Information Center said.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the fire season is shaping up as the worst since
1996, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho.
It began more than a month ago with blazes engulfing areas of
Florida and the Southwest, most notably in Los Alamos, New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agency to Train Bangladeshi Experts to Assess Gas Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States Geological Survey (
USGS) will train six or seven Bangladeshi experts and help
Bangladesh to conduct its own study on the country's gas resource.
</P>
<P>
The USGS, which has been working on assessing gas resource in
Bangladesh for the last one year, offered the training program to
have best possible local participation in the study so that it
becomes acceptable to all, the Daily Star reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The study scheduled to be completed by the end of October this
year is expected to help the Bangladeshi government take vital
decisions regarding future investment in gas sector and re-
consider whether the country should allow pipeline export of gas.
</P>
<P>
A list with names of mid level to senior officials of
Petrobangla has already been finalized and it will now be sent to
the USGS headquarters in Houston.
</P>
<P>
Leading international oil companies (IOCs), including European
oil giant Shell and U.S. oil company Unocal, have been arguing
that Bangladesh's own gas market is not expanding fast enough to
allow them to invest more in exploring oil and gas in the country.
The OICs working in Bangladesh requested the Bangladeshi
government to allow them access to a bigger gas market in India.
</P>
<P>
The demands of the OICs were being backed by the World Bank as
well as the governments of some countries including the United
States. They argued that pipeline export of gas to India would
help Bangladesh earn dollars. This earning would help Bangladesh
maintain a balance of payment as well as pay the IOCs in dollars,
as per their contracts.
</P>
<P>
But local experts resist the idea of gas export, saying that it
would be "Suicidal". They point out that the country's proven gas
reserve of 10 Trillion Cubic Feet is too inadequate to meet it's
own needs.
</P>
<P>
High level discussions between local and foreign experts
concluded that no decision on gas export could be taken before
know of gas reserve. It was unanimously agreed that first the
country must have a credible study on gas reserve.

are in one way or the other, occurred due to environmental
degradation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that radical changes are needed, if forests all
over the world are to survive the next century. In this contrast,
solutions to forest degradation are more political than technical.
</P>
<P>
He added that in order to prevent forest from degradation,
technical solutions as well as human issues, such as the
betterment of human condition, social equity, poverty reduction,
power relations and gender roles are also needed to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has rich resources in forestry and there is no area in
the country that can be strictly called a sandy desert.
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of Myanmar's land area are covered with forest,
of which 18.6 percent are reserved and protected public forests,

<HEADLINE> Technical Glitch Delays U.S. Anti-Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department said
Friday night that a technical problem had delayed for at least two
hours the third test of the National Missile Defense (NMD) system.
</P>
<P>
The glitch was with the target missile, said Defense Department
spokesman Bryan Whitman.
</P>
<P>
He said engineers were hoping to fix the problem -- related to
electronic signals inside the missile that tell ground controllers
its course of flight -- in a short time and that the test was
still expected to start at 0400 GMT.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said earlier that a four-hour launch window opened
at 7 p.m. (0200 GMT Saturday) at Vandenberg Air Force Base where a
target missile is poised for launch.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a U.S. "hit-to-kill" weapon would be fired atop
its own missile from Kwajalein Atoll on the Marshall Islands on
the Pacific some 6,880 kilometers away about 20 minutes after the
Vandenberg launch in an attempt to maneuver, intercept and smash
into the "enemy" warhead.
</P>
<P>
The 55-kilogram weapon, built by Raytheon Co., is designed to
hit and smash the target into space dust at a speed of 24,000 kph
in a flash that would be captured by long-range cameras.
</P>
<P>
The first such test in last October was successful, although
there was a problem with finding the approaching warhead. A second
such test failed early this year.
</P>
<P>
The results of Friday's test is expected to weigh heavily in U.
S. President Bill Clinton's planned decision in the coming months
on whether to begin building the NMD.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said earlier that he will take into account the
feasibility of such a system, its cost, its impact on the overall
national security system and an assessment of the threat to the
Untied States when he makes his decision.
</P>
<P>
The anti-missile system is designed to provide protection for
all 50 U.S. states against ballistic missile attacks. A base with
20 interceptor missiles would be built in Alaska State, along with
a new radar to help guide the missiles to their target. By 2007,
under the current schedule, the system would be expanded to 100
interceptor missiles. The Pentagon estimates the cost at 36
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the NMD, opposed by the international
community, will not only spark a new arms race, but also threaten
security and stimulate nuclear proliferation, instead of promoting
security and stemming the spread of nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> China-EU Relations on Track for Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China Daily, the national English-
language newspaper, today published a bylined article on China-
European Union (EU) relations, describing them as on track for
success.
</P>
<P>
The author, an expert with the European Institute under the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that mutual economic
interests and strategic interdependence are the bases upon which
Sino-European relations have shifted from confrontation to co-
operation in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Gu Junli said that Sino-European relations are characterized by
a "double track". This means that while China develops her
bilateral relations with the EU member countries respectively, she
has also attached importance to improving relations with the
European Union as a whole in relation to economic integration.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the European Commission, for the first time, decided
to provide assistance for a program in China sponsored by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The EU and China began political dialogue in 1994. One year
later, the two sides held a dialogue on human rights, clearing
major obstacles hindering the development of relations.
</P>
<P>
Since then, bilateral trade volume has increased by a large
margin. In 1998, the figure soared to 40.34 billion U.S. dollars,
compared with 11.61 billion U.S. dollars in 1991. The EU has
become China's third largest trading partner, accounting for 15
percent of China's foreign trade volume.

<HEADLINE> China to Protect Grassland in Northeast Plain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The government of Jilin Province
in northeast China will invest one billion yuan (about 120 million
U.S. dollars) in the coming 10 years to prevent a grassland area
from turning into saline-alkali land or desert.
</P>
<P>
Overgrazing and cultivation of paddy fields in the grassland,
located in western Jilin and at the heart of the Songnen Plain,
have caused environmental problems and affected local animal
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1999, the grassland, home to well-bred sheep
and cattle, shrank by 1.8 percent every year, 16.5 times the speed
for the period from 1955 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
The quality of grass has also degenerated considerably, local
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The province has 2.1 million hectares of grassland but one
third of the total is not usable.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the provincial government has worked
out a plan to harness one quarter of the affected grassland and
stop agriculture cultivation and plant grass in 400,000 hectares
of land in the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
This year, the provincial government will allocate 108 million
yuan for grassland conservation.

<HEADLINE> Violence Continues in Indonesia's Ambon Despite Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Violence has continued to wreck
several areas in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku, since the
province was placed under a state of civil emergency two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Governor Saleh Latuconsina, who is also civil emergency chief
executive in his province, said soon after the emergency took
effect, he duly took coordinated steps to quell further unrest.
</P>
<P>
"But the reality in the field was that the clashes continued,"
he was quoted by the Antara News Agency Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The latest clash took place on Thursday when residents of Liang
and Tulehu villages attacked Waai village which is only 28
kilometers from Ambon. The group renewed their assault on Friday,
destroying the remaining houses and a church with mortars, bombs
and grenades.
</P>
<P>
Data gathered from a civil emergency crisis center said that 17
Waai locals died, mostly from gunshot wounds, and 14 others were
injured. Five attackers also died in the fighting and 41 were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of buildings, including houses, schools and houses of
worship in Waai were burnt down.
</P>
<P>
Antara said that the attack had been sparked by the shooting of
three Muslims, one of them fatal, in an area located between the
warring villages two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
"If the security forces had done some early anticipation, the
clashes of the past three days would certainly not have happened,"
Latuconsina said.
</P>
<P>
About the fate of the Waai villagers, he said he had instructed
the Ambon navigation service to use a ship belonging to the
Transportation Ministry to evacuate them as well as to transport
additional security forces.
</P>
<P>
The spice islands of Maluku have been wrecked by communal
clashes since early 1999. Thousands of people were either killed
or wounded and hundreds of public buildings destroyed.

strategic move," he said, adding that the region holds tremendous
opportunities for Canadian businesses.

According to Canada's official statistics, two-way trade
between Canada and Chile totaled 782 million Canadian dollars (
about 526 million U.S. dollars) in 1999, an 11.8 percent increase
from the previous year.

Canada's two-way trade with Colombia reached 535.6 million
Canadian dollars (about 360 million U.S. dollars) in 1999. Its two-

<HEADLINE> England May Mount World Club Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of England
may turn their attention to hosting the second World club
championships after losing the right to host the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
FIFA plans to stage the championship, which Corinthians won in
January, every two years, with the next one set to take place in
the summer of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The format may change to include 12 teams, including two each
from the five continents and also the last two winners of the
Champions League.
</P>
<P>
Two sets of champions adjudged to be from the weakest of the
six continents will play off for one place while the host country
will also enter a team.
</P>
<P>
At the moment only Spain and Australia have expressed an
interest so England seem to be in a good position.
</P>
<P>
And despite losing out in the World Cup battle, FA chief
executive Adam Crozier believes England are in a better position
on the world football scene than ever before.
</P>
<P>
"I do think we are in a better position internationally than we
have been for a long time with FA chairman Geoff Thompson being
recently elected to UEFA's executive committee," he said. Before,
English football was so insular. If you are not on the inside, you
cannot influence things."

<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's world heavyweight champion
Lennox Lewis will receive another prestigious boxing honor after
his title defence against Francois Botha at the London Arena next
week.
</P>
<P>
Lewis, generally regarded as the true world champion, will be
presented with the World Boxing Council's Champion of the Year
award from WBC president Jose Sulaiman at the post-fight press
conference.
</P>
<P>
"The WBC has voted Lennox as the Champion of the Year 1999. He
is a wonderful example to young people, great for the WBC and for
world boxing," said Sulaiman.
</P>
<P>
The South African-born Botha goes into the 15 July contest as a
rank outsider.
</P>
<P>
But Botha, who is now a US citizen, will not go home empty-
handed even if he loses to Lewis, as he will be presented with a
commemorative medal after the bout.
</P>
<P>
The new chairman of the Board of Control, Lord Brooks of
Tremorfa, will also receive a plaque from the WBC to mark his
election to the senior post in British boxing.

<HEADLINE> FIFA World Cup Probe After Dempsey Threat Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- FIFA have launched an internal
inquiry into sleazy allegations surrounding the awarding of the
2006 World Cup to Germany, after revelations of death threats made
against one of the members of the organization's powerful
executive committee.
</P>
<P>
New Zealander Charles Dempsey, the Oceania football chief, told
FIFA officials that threats had been made against him. He decided
to abstain when it came to final voting - he had been expected to
back South Africa - and Germany won by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for soccer's world governing body said the German
Football Federation (DFB) and the organising committee will join
in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Other allegations surround a letter, purporting to be from the
Germans, offering gifts in return for votes, but FIFA have already
dismissed this as a hoax.
</P>
<P>
The death threats however, are being taken seriously. FIFA
communications director Keith Cooper, speaking during a BBC Radio
5 Live phone-in, described how Dempsey had mentioned the threats
to other delegates at yesterday's executive committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Cooper, who attended the meeting, said: "Charlie referred at
the beginning of the meeting to legal advice which he had taken
because of the difficult personal situation he found himself in
and I would absolutely subscribe to the description of intolerable
unbearable personal pressure."
</P>
<P>
Asked to detail the manner of the pressure Dempsey was under,
Cooper said: "If you think of your own personal safety and that of
the people who are close and dear to you."
</P>
<P>
When asked if Cooper meant death threats, he replied: "If you
want to interpret it that way I would not disagree with it."
</P>
<P>
When asked where the death threats came from, he added: "I don'
t know. That's not my business but he (Dempsey) made that clear to
the meeting."
</P>
<P>
Dempsey, 78, himself cited "very strong reasons" for his
decision to abstain but refused to detail what they were.
</P>
<P>
"I had very strong reasons but I am not going into them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
His voice quaking, he said: "I did not do it lightly. I do not
make decisions like that lightly. I was under unsustainable
pressure. I am not going to discuss the pros and cons of it until
I have discussed it with my executive."
</P>
<P>
The decision to abstain in the crucial final vote at FIFA
headquarters in Zurich has not gone down well in Scottish-born
Dempsey's adopted homeland.
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Trevor Mallard described Dempsey as an "
international embarrassment" while Prime Minister Helen Clark
stuck the boot in, saying she was upset by the result as she had
promised New Zealand's support for the South African bid.
</P>
<P>
Mark Burgess, New Zealand's representative on the Oceania
Football Confederation (OFC), said Dempsey, 78, had not followed
instructions given to him at the Confederation's meeting in Samoa
in May - to vote for England and once they were out of the running
to support South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe he has done this intentionally to shoot
himself in the foot back here," Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
"The vote was a democratic one in Samoa, they still preferred
England in the first vote, but on the second the vote was to go to
South Africa."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa's unsuccessful bid committee for the
2006 World Cup has launched their own investigation into Thursday'
s decision to award the tournament to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Bid chairman Irvin Khoza said Dempsey had "betrayed the South
African people".
</P>
<P>
The German 2006 World Cup campaign team have distanced
themselves from the letter sent to up to 10 members of the FIFA
executive committee which supposedly offered them "a gift" in
return for their support for Germany.
</P>
<P>
The letter, sent from Frankfurt to the hotels of committee
members on the eve of the vote, was - according to FIFA vice-
president Jack Warner - "badly typed, poorly phrased with spelling
mistakes and, as far as I'm concerned, a hoax".
</P>
<P>
It purported to come from a certain Martin Hansen, who claimed
to be secretary of TDES (WM 2006 initiative), yet no German
journalists covering Thursday's vote in Zurich had heard of such
an organization.
</P>
<P>
German campaign team spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach added: "It is
nonsense. I have seen the letter for the first time in my life
when it was shown to me just now."
</P>
<P>
"If this is a joke then it is a very bad joke. I can confirm
that there is no Martin Hansen on the German bid committee. I have
worked on the bid for seven years now and I have never heard of
this name, "he said. "The letter is not official and the telephone
number given at the bottom is nothing to do with the German FA."
</P>
<P>
A FIFA spokesman added: "We have had discussions with members
of the German bid committee and both of us will be conducting
internal inquiries. Exactly what form those will take remains to
be seen."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Security Forces Disperse Troublemakers: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security forces on Saturday
dispersed a group of troublemakers near the Enqelab square in
downtown Tehran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The troublemakers clashed with the security forces at about 1730
local time (1300 GMT) and were dispersed after a few hours, the
report said, adding the windows of some buildings were broken
during the clash but nobody injured.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the troublemakers were actually divided
into two groups, one marching in support of Iran's Islamic system,
and the other voicing their support for reforms.
</P>
<P>
Saturday was a sensitive day as it was the first anniversary of
last July's student dormitory incident, which happened when anti-
riot police raided students in Tehran University to crack down on
protests against press restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked six days of nation-wide riots, the worst
since the country's 1979 Islamic revolution. At least one person
was killed and many others injured in the riots.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the situation inside the Tehran
University was quiet on Saturday. Students held a peaceful "free-
violence meeting" to mark the incident on July 8 last year.
</P>
<P>
Students at the gathering stressed that they should avoid
violence in case they be used by conservative hardliners in the
country to undermine President Mohammad Khatami's reform programs,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Hopes David Camp Summit to Pave Way for Peace: King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
said Saturday Jordan hopes the upcoming David Camp summit by
U.S., Israeli and Palestinian leaders will help pave the way for a
just and durable peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The monarch made the remarks when meeting with visiting Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak who arrived here in the evening to brief
Jordan on Israel's stand in the three-way summit slated for July 11
in the David Camp near Washington.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah told Barak that Jordan hopes the three parties
will do their utmost to guarantee a success of the summit to pave
the way for a peace based on international legitimacy and to meet
aspirations for peace by all peoples in the region.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also pledged his kingdom will continue its work
on a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 as the second
Arab country after Egypt to reach peace with the Jewish state.
Since then, Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel and
its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Though not a party to the three-way summit, King Abdullah and
Jordanian officials have been in extensive touches with U.S.,
Israeli and Palestinian leaders and officials over the agenda of
the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli and Palestinian officials remained tight lipped
to reporters over their stands in the summit.
</P>
<P>
Barak left Amman Saturday night after the brief meeting with
King Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to visit Cario to meet Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak before heading for the United States to join U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for the
summit.

<HEADLINE> Cuba, US Olympic Committees Sign Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban and United States Olympic
Committees signed Saturday an agreement of sports cooperation ,
the first of its kind between the two nations in more than 40
years.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by Cuban Olympic Committee president
Jose Ramon Fernandez and his U.S. counterpart William J. Hybi,
during a ceremony in Havana.
</P>
<P>
The agreement foresees cooperation in the Olympic sports, the
combat to the use of forbidden substances, and maintenance of
communication between the two Olympic committees, said Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
"We are very satisfied with the (Hybi) visit, during which an
stage has been completed, as we had foreseen it in conversations
previously held," said the Cuban sports official.
</P>
<P>
Hybi said that "it is a pleasure for the U.S Olympic Committee
to close a deal of collaboration with its counterpart of the
island, and we expect that a wider collaboration between the two
countries will also occur."
</P>
<P>
This is a great opportunity to have a good start in the
cooperation between the Olympic committees of the United States
and Cuba, to have some kind of collaboration between our athletes,
" said Hybi.
</P>
<P>
Hybi said of eventual desertions of Cuban sportsmen in
competitions in the United States, that there will be difficulties,
"now and in the future, and we will work for a joint solution" to
this problem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. sports official said that Cuba and United States are
very competitive in the Pan-American Olympic games, as it was
shown in the continental contest of Winnipeg in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Another Nigerian State to Launch Sharia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's northern state of Katsina
has announced plans to introduce the controversial Islamic legal
code, the Sharia, on August 1, swelling the ranks of the states
which have adopted the law.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria Saturday quoted the Special
Assistant on Media and Publicity to the state governor, Musa
Kankaran, as saying in a statement in Katsina on Friday that the
government had submitted to the state House of Assembly a bill on
the establishment of the Sharia courts. The Sharia courts would
start adjudicating on the Sharia-related matter on August 1.
</P>
<P>
The majority muslim population in the state have been agitating
for the introduction of the Koran-based law to follow suit of
four other neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Zamfara became the first to introduce the Sharia,
though it only became effective in the state this year, followed
by Niger, Sokoto and Kano states.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian christians have objected the introduction of the
Sharia, saying the country's secularism, prescribed by the
constitution, made the introduction of the law illegal.
</P>
<P>
But Muslims countered by saying the law was a way of life and a
must for them, and that it would not affect the minority
christians living among them.
</P>
<P>
A proposal to introduce the law in Kaduna early this year led
to a violent clash between christians and muslims in the state,
with hundreds of lives lost.

De Trazegnies said about the possibility of sanctions applied
to Peru by the United States if his country does not abide by the
proposals of the Organization of American States (OAS) for
democratic reforms, that his government committed itself to
examine an agenda, not to implement recommendations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that his
country pressures President Alberto Fujimori to implement the OAS
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has a right to speak about whatever he or she wants,
but in reality, I do not think that friends must look to each
other in the eyes with a stick in their hand," he said.
</P>
<P>
An OAS high-level mission led by its general secretary Cesar
Gaviria and Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy visited
recently Peru and handed Fujimori proposals for the improvement of
democratic institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
De Trazegnies said that any warning from the United States has
to be unilaterally taken by the Fujimori government.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan City Masaya in Peril After Big Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Intermittent earthquakes Saturday
continue threatening the city of Masaya in the southeast of
Nicaragua after two strong tremors killed seven people, injured
more than 60, damaged 1,130 houses, and 4,512 had to be taken out
of their houses.
</P>
<P>
The most recent of these natural phenomena occurred Friday in
Masaya, 30 kilometers southeast of Managua, at 18:19 local time (
00:19 GMT) and caused the death of three people, damaged eight
houses and 90 people had to be taken to refuges.
</P>
<P>
But this city of 24,104 residents and famous for its
handicrafts has dozens of houses with cracked walls, which being
old and built with adobe and roofed with clay tiles, are dangerous
for their inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
The 5.9 degrees on the Richter open scale seism occurred in the
northern bank of the  Apoyo lagoon, at a depth of 500 meters,
which was a factor of the destruction caused.
</P>
<P>
Material damage has not been assessed in all its magnitude, and
they affected even two city graveyards, where the walls collapsed.

EU) will provide funds for social works only, instead of weapons
for the South American country.
</P>
<P>
FARC spokesman Andres Paris proposed that the EU should not
project the impression that it supports the Plan Colombia "as a
war plan promoted by the United States."
</P>
<P>
The government of President Andres Pastrana obtained in Madrid
during a meeting with donor countries, pledges for 871 million
dollars for the Plan Colombia, aimed at development, peace, and
war against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 7.5 billion dollars, of which four
billion will be contributed by the Colombian government, which
expects the remaining 3.5 billion dollars to come from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Paris, one of the five FARC spokesmen in the National Table of
Dialogue and Negotiation with the government, said that the rebels
were very happy when the EU warned that the European contributions
would be directed to the social area.
</P>
<P>
The United States will contribute 1.3 billion dollars mainly
for military supplies for the war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Europe cannot become the carrot in a big stick conception as
the Plan Colombia is," said Paris.
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said President Pastrana's controversial "Plan
Colombia" is a carrot-and-stick strategy to persuade Colombia's
estimated 22,000 rebels into cutting a peace deal after three
decades of war.
</P>
<P>
The United States will contribute 250 million dollars of the
871 million dollars in pledges received by Colombia, Spain 100
million, Norway 20 million, Japan 70 million, and the United
Nations 131 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the Inter-american Development Bank and the
Andean Corporation of Development (CAF) will grant credits for 300
million dollars.

LIMA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Peru's Agrarian Health National
Service (SENASA) suspended Saturday the import of several poultry
products, byproducts and eggs from Honduras, because of the recent
outbreak of the "Newcastle Velogenic" disease in that Central
American country.

<P>
The agency in charge of supervising the import of agriculture
and livestock products said that the imports suspension includes
fertile eggs for breeding and for consuming, chicks, chicken meat,
fighting cocks and wild or nursery-raised singing birds.
</P>
<P>
SENASA announced six cases of the "Newcastle Velogenic" disease
in the Honduran departments of Francisco Morazan and Cortes.

The institution also explained that the virus that causes the
disease is not endemic in Peru and for that reason those birds or
their products are not appropriate to be sold in the country.
