N.J. ISSUES RULES FOR ENFORCING SEX-OFFENDER LAW
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ New Jersey's attorney general issued revised
guidelines on ``Megan's Law'' Thursday, including the first rules
on school officials' roles in issuing alerts about paroled sex
offenders living or working near schools.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the booklet focuses on technical and legal
questions for the state's 21 county prosecutors, it also gives
school superintendents and principals their first detailed guidance
on the legal do's and don'ts of helping law enforcement authorities
carry out the law's notification provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general, Peter Verniero, said the new guidelines
were designed to answer questions that school officials have on the
law and to insure that it is applied uniformly throughout New
Jersey. ``We want to make sure we have one system in place, rather
than 21 in 21 different counties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The law touched off the nationwide movement for notification of
sex offenders living in communities, but its three-year journey
through state and federal courts has left its notification
provisions far more conservative than those enacted by the New
Jersey Legislature in 1994 after Megan Kanka, 7, was raped and
murdered by a neighbor, Jesse Timmendequas, in Hamilton Township.
Timmendequas, a repeat sex offender, was sentenced to death last
June.
</P>
<P>
   Before the State Supreme Court restricted notifications in 1995,
some offenders classified as the greatest public risks saw their
names and addresses posted on telephone poles, printed in
newspapers and taped to the front doors of town halls.
</P>
<P>
   To protect the privacy rights and anonymity of paroled
offenders, the 1995 decision limited notifications about the
highest risks to schools; organizations that care for children and
women, and those who live near the offenders' home or workplace and
were ``likely to encounter'' the offenders. Only schools and
organizations caring for women and children, and not neighbors, can
be told about offenders whom the county prosecutors classify as
moderate risks of committing a new crime.
</P>
<P>
   In the cases of both moderate and high risks, school principals
can pass on information about an offender to school employees ``in
a position to observe unauthorized persons'' on or near school
property. These employees include teachers and their assistants,
security workers, bus drivers, coaches, janitors, administrators
and professional support staff. Parents, members of parent-teacher
organizations and high school students can be told only of
high-risk offenders living or working near a school. Parents of
children enrolled from kindergarten through eighth grade can be
informed by notices sent home with the children in a sealed
envelope or through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Under the risk-assessment system created by the attorney
general's office after the State Supreme Court's 1995 decision, 2.2
percent of those who have been classified thus far are high risks,
29.3 percent are moderate risks, and 68.5 percent are low risks
who, under the law, do not face any community notification.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines define high risks as those who have assaulted,
while armed, at least three victims they did not know; engaged in
some form of sexual penetration, and inflicted lasting or serious
physical injury.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of moderate risks include neighbors, baby sitters or
coaches who have fondled a child under the child's clothing after
threatening physical harm.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of low-risk offenders include those who have exposed
themselves, sexually abused a younger sibling or their own child,
fondled a child over his or her clothing or fondled an adult
without use of force.

COYOTES SHIP JANNEY TO TAMPA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Craig Janney, the first-line center and No. 4 scorer for the
Coyotes last season, predicted he wouldn't play in Phoenix next
season. On Thursday, he was proven correct.
</P>
<P>
   In what some characterize as a money-saving and roster-clearing
move, Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith traded Janney to Tampa
Bay for journeyman left wing/enforcer Louie DeBrusk and the
Lightning's first pick of the fifth round in the amateur entry
draft this month.
</P>
<P>
   Janney, who didn't return phone calls, produced 10 goals and 43
assists in 68 games. He is entering the final year of his contract
and is scheduled to earn $1.7 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay General Manager Phil Esposito insinuated that budget
concerns by the Coyotes were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Coyotes) have a budget thing going on over there,''
Esposito told the Tampa media. ``With (Sandy) McCarthy, (Enrico)
Circcone and (Andrei) Nazarov, we have plenty of toughness on our
team. What we wanted was somebody to get the puck to our wings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are negotiating what could be a costly contract
extension with Captain Keith Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   With their expected decision not to bring back veteran Mike
Gartner, who either will retire or become a free agent July 1, the
Coyotes will save $1.5 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   The additional savings made by eliminating Janney's salary can
be targeted to retain Tkachuk, possibly without having to also part
company with assistant captain Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't characterize it as that (a cost-saving move),
although it is a significant payroll deduction,'' Smith said.
``It's a trade that clarifies our situation in the middle and
clearly sets up Jeremy Roenick and Cliff Ronning as our top two
centers. It also gives Daniel Briere a chance to push for a roster
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how long we can keep Briere in the (American
Hockey League). I think he's a player and he's going to be an
excellent NHL player in time, but he'll have to earn a spot in
training camp. I expect Craig Janney to have a very good season in
Tampa.''
</P>
<P>
   Briere, who scored one goal in five games in Phoenix, led
Springfield scoring with 36 goals, 56 assists and 92 points in 68
games, fourth in the AHL.
</P>
<P>
   League sources sources said the Coyotes have been trying to
trade Janney for two weeks and were considering making him
available on the waiver wire or in this month's expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Tkachuk and Janney are close, and the captain has
made no secret that he prefers Janney to center him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the trade will sour Tkachuk on completing a
contract extension, Smith answered strongly, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said earlier that the team faces three options with
Tkachuk: It can re-sign him to an extension, he can sit out next
season without pay or the team can trade him, and he added that all
three are viable.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are rampant in the NHL that Tkachuk's contract demands
could mean the Coyotes can't afford to keep both him and Roenick,
but the trade of Janney and Smith's declaration of Roenick as his
top-line center contradicts them.
</P>
<P>
   Center is a position where the Coyotes have an abundance of
players, with Roenick, Ronning, recently re-signed Mike Stapleton,
Bob Corkum, Juha Ylonen, Mark Janssens and Briere.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum and Janssens are restricted Group II free agents.
</P>
<P>
   In DeBrusk, the Coyotes obtained an enforcer who might end up in
Springfield. Enforcer is another position where they seem to have
players in abundance, with Jim McKenzie, Jim Cummins, Janssens and
Sean Gagnon. Like Janssens, McKenzie and Gagnon are restricted free
agents who might receive offers the team won't match. &QL;

FREE AGENCY SETS PIPPEN FREE OF BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ You should've seen the grin. It was devious,
liberated, warranted. And it beamed from Scottie Pippen like a man
leaving Alcatraz for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   See, the sentence is about to expire, the suppression nearly
over. One victory away from a place he has always wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   In demand. In control. And if Jerry Colangelo is smart, on his
way to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play without him is like a slap in the face for me,''
Michael Jordan said. ``But I want him to do well. I think he's
entitled to find out what his net worth is.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Bulls brace themselves for a final farewell, a weepy
sentiment is emerging and the posturing has already begun. On
Thursday, Phil Jackson talked about rays of hope that could prolong
a dynasty. Jordan claimed his teammate is keeping his options open,
already putting the heat on ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Except Pippen walked into a room and slammed the door shut. And
you should've seen the grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really want to know?`` Pippen said. ``I want the
opportunity to go out and open all the doors to the free agent
market. I don't have any intentions of coming back here next
season, even though I stated a couple of days ago that I would look
to come back. I think this is the last run for this ballclub.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Many options &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, will it pave the way for Colangelo's first real banner?
</P>
<P>
   After a monstrous performance in the Finals, Pippen will find
plenty of suitors. He wants to be wanted, flooded with offers. And
while there were rumblings among agents last week that Pippen's
price tag will be too high for the Suns, a team that must allocate
some cap room for a center, this isn't about money alone.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he just ruled out the Bulls, which could be his most
lucrative option.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably is,'' Pippen said. ``But I don't want to come back
and play for four years and just go for a title for one season. I
have to look at the longevity of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Colangelo should be licking his chops. Pippen is
yearning for a new beginning, and the Suns are a perfect fit. And
whatever Colangelo can't give him in annual salary, he should give
him in years, just like A.C. Green.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, this is where Colangelo's reputation pays
off. This is when he can swoop in, provide a friendly haven for
abused athletes, show them an organization that doesn't run on
contention. Precisely what Pippen is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that's a stretch, know that Pippen makes $2.7
million a year. If you blame him for signing the contract, know
that other organizations willingly reward underpaid superstars. If
you can't relate to a millionaire livid over his working
conditions, know that every profession is relative, centered around
respect.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the vindictive tweakings Bulls' management has
directed at Pippen, one story tells all _ the day he asked General
Manager Jerry Krause if he could buy a championship trophy replica
only to hear he wasn't deserving. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Out of Jordan's shadow &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget the mindless chatter that Pippen can't survive without
Jordan, that he's not a fourth-quarter assassin. Forget the laundry
list, too. He is far removed from his petulant past, and in the
past three years, Pippen has matured greatly, emerging from
Jordan's shadow into a leader.
</P>
<P>
   No player is like Pippen, a stallion that has never been
unleashed in an up-tempo offense. He has championship pedigree. He
can show a team how to win.
</P>
<P>
   The real concern is how much he has left. Pippen will turn 33
later this year, and when you factor in two Olympic appearances and
six championship runs, no one has played more games in the past
decade. Risk or rationale?
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Classic Sports, the Suns versus Bulls in 1993, and I was
looking at the difference between Michael and Scottie in five
years,'' Jackson said. ``Scottie is still so terrific in his speed
and anticipation. He is always there, always a harassing person.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he will be there for the taking. And worth every penny. &QL;

<P>
   Jazz too pathetic &QL; 
to warrant any pity
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ This has become so much more than a rout.
</P>
<P>
   It is sheer embarrassment, an utter humiliation for the Utah
Jazz that is so complete, it is almost painful to watch. Like the
episodes of Jerry Springer, we can only peer at it through cracks
in our fingers and shake our heads at the indignity to which people
are willing to subject themselves before the harsh, unforgiving eye
of national television.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shame in losing in the NBA Finals to Michael Jordan
and the Chicago Bulls. Plenty of others have shared in that
experience of misery. It is the manner of the Jazz defeat that is
so troubling. So complete and so demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Jazz in this series is like watching the same
skinny kid get his lunch money stolen by the same school bully day
after day. Rather than scorn, we want to pity them, which for a
supposedly hard-nosed group of competitors is far worse.
</P>
<P>
   Big game, small people. That's how the Jazz will be remembered.
A legacy of shrinking in the spotlight, of shriveling in the
clutch, of taking a step out in the middle of the grandest stage
and forgetting every line that had been rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone, John Stockton, Jeff Hornacek, Bryon Russell, Greg
Foster, Greg Ostertag, Shandon Anderson, Howard Eisley, Jerry
Sloan. All of them.
</P>
<P>
   Late collapses a constant
</P>
<P>
   Especially Malone and Stockton. For the pair of original Dream
Teamers, this has been the ultimate nightmare. It's an experience
that will have so many re-examining their careers and re-evaluating
their places in basketball history.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it is not the losing that makes this so difficult to
swallow. But the way in which the losses have come, by Utah's
shortcomings down the stretch in every game. By an inability to
perform at the time when the fire of competition is hottest and the
greatest stars are defined.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: The Jazz lost Game 3 by an all-time NBA
Finals-record margin of 42 points and scored a mere 54 points, a
low for any NBA team in the era since the shot clock was adopted.
And that was not the depth of ignominy. It is, instead, all these
fourth quarters, all these missed opportunities that get stuck in
the Jazz's throat like a watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 on Wednesday night was no different. Malone took just
three shots in the fourth quarter and scored his only basket in the
final 10 seconds. Stockton kept beating defenders off the dribble
and finding a path to the basket but was unable to get the
basketball to the rim with shots that could have made the
difference for Utah and tied the series.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it has been since the Finals began, with the Jazz
playing the fourth quarter like it was on a treadmill moving in
reverse. Utah coughed up a seven-point lead in the last four
minutes of Game 1 and barely hung on to win in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this effort so embarrassing isn't that the Bulls are
playing an overwhelming brand of basketball. No, athletes can
accept getting whipped by a team that is clearly superior. What the
elite athletes can't _ or shouldn't _ accept is to knuckle under to
their own fear.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to Bulls' intimidation
</P>
<P>
   That's what we're talking about here. Intimidation. The Jazz
can't beat the Bulls and Jordan simply because they are the Bulls
and Jordan. The Jazz is being consumed by the aura of the five-time
NBA champions and the pressure of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   How else can we explain the Mailman, who is giving rise to a
whole cottage industry of postal jokes? He is a fourth-quarter
ghost, a chiseled, muscle-bound shrinking violet. Worse than
missing clutch shots, he isn't taking them.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, 36, is showing his age. He plays half the game now and
can't do many of the things he did a year ago. Hornacek limps
around on bad wheels and is ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, Anderson, Ostertag, Foster and the rest are healthy but
unable to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan, their coach, has tried goading, cajoling, insulting them,
and none of it has worked.
</P>
<P>
   They were so awesome against the Lakers and have been so small
against the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Jazz lost in the Finals to the Bulls but
maintained a dignity, a drive to get back here. This time, the Jazz
said, it would be different. It is. It is worse.
</P>
<P>
   Will Utah stay together for another season? Or will this break
the Jazz?
</P>
<P>
   There has been so much talk of the impending end of the dynasty,
of this being Chicago's ``last dance.'' But it is an image of the
Jazz, looking like wallflowers, that will linger when the music
stops.

BEST SHOW IS BEFORE GAME WITH MCGWIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buck Showalter looked out toward Bank One Ballpark's upper deck
in left field, near a restaurant. That's the area where Mark
McGwire likely will park a bushel of balls during batting practice
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe instead of soup specials, they should have helmet
specials,'' the Diamondbacks manager said.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe stand-up comedy isn't what Showalter should do if he
ever needs another job, but you get the idea. When Big Red comes to
town, expect to get showered with horsehide.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that thousands of fans will congregate in left and
left-center field stands a couple of hours before each of this
weekend's games for the opportunity to snag a drive by the St.
Louis Cardinals slugger, who has 30 home runs and is on pace to
break the single-season record of 61.
</P>
<P>
   At stadiums across the country, the lure of taking home a
McGwire blast has been hard to resist. At some parks, almost 10,000
early arrivals have dashed for baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Regas, general manager of Friday's Front Row Grill at Bank
One Ballpark, said the restaurant that offers outdoor seating will
be jammed for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could watch, but I'll be too busy,'' he said.
``Nobody else has ever had this kind of effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the pre-game radio host will get in the act. Brad Cesmat of
KTAR-AM (620) will be in the outfield stands with a net starting at
6 p.m. Any balls he catches will be donated to the Blind Children's
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Batting practice pitchers do their best to accommodate the
hitters, which in turn means accommodating the fans in the outfield
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just put the ball where the hitter wants it,'' said Marcos
Garcia, one of three batting practice hurlers for the Diamondbacks.
``The big thing is to keep it in the strike zone and keep it at the
same speed. If you change speeds, they might complain. In batting
practice, a player wants to get his stroke down, and he may want a
pitch in a certain spot every time.''
</P>
<P>
   So you catch a McGwire homer during batting practice, and you
have . . . exactly that, a scuffed ball, maybe hit a dozen times,
worth maybe a buck. If you're lucky enough to latch onto a home run
he hits during the game, the sentimental value will far outweigh
the monetary value, even if the slugger eventually surpasses Roger
Maris' mark of 61 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any difference what number it is, other than
60, 61 or 62,'' said Chuck Simo, owner of Nostalgia Stadium in
Scottsdale. ``Any other is just a home run ball, no more
significant than any other. And batting practice home runs are
meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're in the right place at the right time and catch the
ball that breaks Maris' mark, keep your senses about you, Simo
warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get it verified,'' he said. ``Get the names and addresses of
people around you who saw you get the ball. If he does break the
record, whoever gets that ball will probably hold onto it for an
auction for collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to say what it would be worth at this time. For
instance, the ball that Mickey Mantle hit for his first home run
went for $27,000 at an auction. The most expensive ball ever, and
it will go up for auction in November, will be the first home run
ever hit in Yankee Stadium. It was hit by Babe Ruth, and will bring
well over $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even though big money won't be involved, if you're anywhere near
the vicinity of a McGwire home run this weekend, be prepared for
pushing, shoving and maybe a few bruises in the scramble for the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   But if the unthinkable happens, and McGwire just hits grounders
or pop-ups during batting practice, don't start yanking your hair
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize it's not that easy to hit a home run in
batting practice,'' McGwire told columnist Mark Whicker of the
``Orange County Register.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good idea to keep something else in mind when you're
scratching and clawing for baseballs. In many cases, you'll be
invading the territory of fans who have bought seats, and instead

SPORTS OF THE TIMES: JARVIS FITS AT ST. JOHN'S
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The bleeding has stopped, finally.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last week, Rob Ades, the lawyer for Mike Jarvis,
had predicted that when the smoke cleared and Jarvis was introduced
as St. John's head basketball coach there would be no warm, fuzzy
feelings. There would be no hugs.
</P>
<P>
   But here they were Thursday, at the end of an hourlong news
conference, and the Rev. Donald Harrington, the St. John's
president, and Jarvis gave each other a long hug.
</P>
<P>
   This was more than a photo opportunity. This was a celebration
of two ships more or less rejoicing that they did not pass in the
night. For the 53-year-old Jarvis, the new job represents the
opportunity of a lifetime. Regarded as one of the ``hot coaching
prospects'' for the last six years, Jarvis finally cashed in with a
contract reportedly worth $5 million over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis had hit a ceiling at George Washington. At St. Johns, in
New York, he has a larger stage, access to all-America caliber
players and a mega-conference, the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was happy and excited to get this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   For conservative St. Johns, the bold move effectively marks the
first time since 1965 _ when Lou Carnesecca took over from Joe
Lapchick _ that university actually pursued and hired its first
choice for basketball coach. St. John's desperately needed and
wanted a high profile coach to complement a larger quest for
expansion, Harrington explained Thursday. This meant establishing a
major investment in technology, opening a campus in Rome, establish
a global presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is an important thing for us,'' Harrington said,
``not just because it helped us maintain a major sports program,
but also because it is an excellent means for us to communicate St.
Johns to alumni and friends. We have people who know about St.
John's, read about St. John's, only because of the basketball
team.''
</P>
<P>
   What these friends have read for the last six years has been
disastrous. There was the ``loyalty hiring'' hiring of Brian
Mahoney in 1992 to replace the legendary Lou Carnesecca, whom
Mahoney had served for a number of years. There was the firing of
Mahoney in 1996. Then there was the embarrassment of being rebuffed
by several high profile coaches before finally settling for Fran
Fraschilla of Manhattan. Last month came the messy parting with
Fraschilla, followed by a very public private pursuit of candidates
to fill the vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of Jarvis marks the end of that ugly, sometimes
nasty, epoch of St. Johns basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, and necessarily, Jarvis is the first outsider to take
up residence in Alumni Hall, a non-New Yorker, a non-white male. He
also becomes the Big East's fifth African-American head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of conferences made up of historically black college
conferences, the Big East has more African-American head coaches
than any major Division I conference in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the nice platitudes and homilies to the Vincentian
mission at St. John's, the most persistent question surrounding
Jarvis is permanency: Will he stay or will he bolt to the National
Basketball Association at the first opportunity?
</P>
<P>
   ``I take that as a compliment that somebody would think I would
be good enough to be a head coach in the NBA,'' said Jarvis, who in
1995 interviewed for the Boston Celtics job. ``That's how I take
it. Look at my track record.'' St. John's is still in denial over
the amount of money being tossed at Jarvis. Although Harrington
denied Nike was directly involved in the contract, he later said
the burden of Jarvis' salary would be reduced because of
contributions being made by Nike and Host Communications, the
nation's leading sports marketer.
</P>
<P>
   A number of professors and students and one assistant soccer
coach have expressed outrage over reported involvement by Nike.
</P>
<P>
   For St. John's, the program, will never be the same in terms of
aspirations and expectations. They could have hired Paul Hewitt of
Siena and been happy, could have hired Davidson's Bob McKillop and
been happy, but for the presence they wanted, Jarvis was the man.
</P>
<P>
   And he may be a more permanent presence than people think.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis is reluctant to move. He lived in the same house in
Cambridge, Mass., for 17 years. He told his wife they could get a
new home anywhere, as long as it was it was in Cambridge. But after
he took the George Washington job, and watched that work out well,
he changed his philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move to Washington taught me that it's not so much the
place _ that's just building and structures _ as much as it's the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The people at St. John's like Jarvis; Jarvis likes the people.
It's what they call a fit. &QL;

LEADERS NEEDED FOR SUCCESS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Oakland Athletics of the late 1980s, as talented a
collection of players the game had seen in decades, had it. So has
nearly every World Series champion.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator to almost all championship clubs is
strong leadership from within. Very few rudderless clubs are
capable of winning a championship of any kind, whether it's a
division title or the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership is not overrated,'' said Reggie Smith, an integral
part of the great Dodgers clubs of the 1970s. ``You do need to have
it, regardless of where it comes from. Look at the teams that do
well and they all have someone or several that the other players
trust and respond to.''
</P>
<P>
   The current Dodgers and Colorado Rockies, a pair of sputtering
clubs who, by most accounts, should be better, have each been
accused of lacking leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone associated with the Rockies believes the
club dearly misses first baseman Andres Galarraga and shortstop
Walt Weiss. Neither player was very vocal, but each set an example
that was undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss those guys more than anyone around here wants to
admit,'' one Rockies player said. ``They kept some of the, quote,
stars around here in check. Everyone had to work as hard as they
did because you looked foolish if you didn't. That's not the case
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The tremendously talented Dodgers have been referred to as
classic underachievers the past four years. A lack of leadership
among the players has been blamed for most, if not all, of the
Dodgers' shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' primary whipping boy always was catcher Mike
Piazza, the highest-paid player and the one in the spotlight. It
always seemed to be Piazza's fault when the Dodgers' pitching staff
didn't perform at the same level as Atlanta's famed staff.
</P>
<P>
   During spring training, former Los Angeles center fielder Brett
Butler, now retired, laced into Piazza for his lack of leadership
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Piazza is the greatest hitter I have ever been around,
but you can't build around Piazza because he is not a leader,''
Butler told the ``Los Angeles Times.'' ``Mike Piazza is a moody,
self-centered, '90s player. We're in crunch time during pennant
races the last two years and all Piazza seems to care about is
winning the MVP from Larry Walker or the batting title from Tony
Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to spend $100 million and build your team around
that or pay for a less-talented guy who is more of a leader?''
</P>
<P>
   Butler's words ricocheted throughout the Dodgers' clubhouse.
Some players privately agreed with Butler. Some, of course, did
not. Either way, Piazza, now with the New York Mets, did not seem
to leave many friends behind.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Piazza being jettisoned from LA in one of the
biggest trades in baseball history last month, several Dodgers
spoke of the club's situation finally being relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electricity in here is unbelievable,'' second baseman Eric
Young said. ``It was like we're starting a brand new season. You
hate to see a guy like Mike Piazza leave, but we knew something had
to be done. It just wasn't clicking. But now, everything is
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Ramon Martinez said, ``Everybody can see the difference
in the team. Everyone is excited again, and we feel good about the
team. You can see a big difference on the bench in the games.
Everything is better now.''
</P>
<P>
   To put the blame for the Dodgers' shortcomings squarely on
Piazza is not fair, said former Dodgers great and current San Diego
coach Davey Lopes, considered one of the best leaders of all-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't force leadership on a player,'' Lopes said. ``Some
players have enough problems worrying about themselves and can't
carry the emotional and physical weight of also being the team's
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like charisma; you can't turn it on if you don't have it.
Being a leader is an intangible that some players are born with.
It's how others perceive you to be. Organizations make mistakes and
think they can make someone a leader. You can't assume the role, it
has to come from the person.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it can take years to discover a leader or bring one
into an organization. As an expansion club, the Diamondbacks are at
a disadvantage because they were thrown together for the first time
during spring training. Jay Bell is a candidate. Someone who might
emerge at some point is rookie first baseman Travis Lee, who could
develop into a silent leader.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego third baseman Ken Caminiti, considered one of the
great silent leaders, never asked for the role. Like a truly great
leader, he never pushed it away when it was headed in his
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it comes from the way you carry yourself and the way
you play the game,'' said Caminiti, the unanimous National League
MVP in 1996. ``It's something you earn. I don't mind it at all. If
you have respect you can say whatever. But you have to be
constructive, not a (jerk). You can't have a winning club without
leaders among the players. It can't come from the (coaching)
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership can come in many different forms. Those Oakland clubs
that went to the World Series three consecutive years from 1988 to
1990 were loaded with players who went in their own direction.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson, Jose Canseco, Dennis Eckersley and Dave Parker
weren't exactly the kind of players who would take kindly to any
player getting in their face and telling him what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Those A's clubs that averaged more than 100 victories over a
three-year period may have seemed more like rock stars on tour, but
they weren't without leadership from within the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Carney Lansford provided some with his
blue-collar, workmanlike approach that helped him serve as the
leader for the bulk of the A's. For the rest, the superstars, there
was center fielder Dave Henderson, who surprisingly wielded more
clout than may have been known at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's constant gap-toothed smile provided the perfect
cover for his often pointed jokes in the clubhouse and the dugout.
It was not uncommon to hear Henderson making comments such as:
</P>
<P>
   ``The right fielder (Canseco) should have made that catch in the
sixth inning. If he had we would have won the game. Maybe he was
checking out some babe in the stands. All I know is the next time,
he better have his head in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco would laugh along with several other teammates at the
inference, but the message was sent crystal clear. The other A's
all knew what was being said, even if it was disguised as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson would just as easily rankle Canseco as he would Rickey
Henderson or Bob Welch or even Manager Tony La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hendu said what had to be said,'' said Dave Stewart, a 20-game
winner on those Oakland staffs. ``He wasn't shy with his criticisms
but he never embarrassed a player. He said it to get the player
thinking and nine out of 10 times it worked.'' &QL;

TOURISM BUREAU TRYING TO REBRAND PHOENIX AS DESTINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CRAIG ANDERSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix is a sweltering, barren desert devoid of culture,
activities and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   That's what many who have never visited the Valley said when
asked for their impressions of our fair city, according to the
bureau responsible for promoting tourism in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   So the Phoenix and Valley of the Sun Convention and Visitors
Bureau has decided to change its logo, marketing strategy and name
_ to the Greater Phoenix Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about rebranding the visitors bureau,''
Corporate Communications Director Brent DeRaad said. ``It's about
rebranding Phoenix as a destination.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau unveiled a Phoenix promotional campaign Thursday to
about 250 local politicians, business owners and tourism industry
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   One major change is the elimination of ``Valley of the Sun''
from the bureau's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that outside this metropolitan area, nobody knew what
the Valley of the Sun was,'' DeRaad said.
</P>
<P>
   The name change, which takes effect June 24, is not nearly as
important as the bureau's new marketing strategy, DeRaad said.
</P>
<P>
   In a partnership with Phoenix-based advertising and public
relations firm E.B. Lane, the bureau plans to launch an aggressive
ad campaign designed to change America's perceptions of Phoenix, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is a $5 billion-a-year industry in Phoenix, second only
to high-tech as the Valley's leading moneymaker.
</P>
<P>
   While there hasn't been a decrease in visitors to the area,
DeRaad said the competition is getting tougher and it is better to
take a proactive approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure we do all we can to reach all the people
we can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Radcliffe, the bureau's president and chief executive
officer, said he has always wanted to do more to promote Phoenix
but the funding just wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Phoenix City Council approved a new $5 million
budget that will allow the bureau to undertake a more extensive
campaign than was previously possible.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach will include heavy promotion of golf, hiking
and resort opportunities in the area, DeRaad said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there will be a new logo to replace the familiar but
undistinctive Phoenix bird.
</P>
<P>
   The new symbol will be a luggage tag with ``PHX'' _ the city's
airport code _ stamped across it.
</P>
<P>
   DeRaad said it was designed to help more people think of Phoenix
as a travel destination.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau hired several photographers to take pictures of the
area that would capture the attention and imagination of potential
tourists, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The photos will be used in print advertisements nationwide. &QL;

D-BACKS FEAST ON ANGELS  
 DAAL MANAGES 8 STRONG INNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buck Showalter occupies a comfort zone the size of a thimble. No
lead is too big, no situation too safe for the Diamondbacks
manager.
</P>
<P>
   But even Showalter was feeling pretty good about his team's
chances late in the game Wednesday night against the Anaheim
Angels. The Diamondbacks
</P>
<P>
   were on their way to a 10-2 victory, ending the Angels'
nine-game winning streak. Pitcher Omar Daal was going eight strong
innings, the longest start of his career. The only remaining
suspense was whether Jay Bell would hit for the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' shortstop got the tough stuff out of the way
early, hitting a triple off starter Ken Hill to score the first of
four second-inning runs, then dunking a Hill pitch into the pool at
Bank One Ballpark in the third for a two-run homer and a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   His next time up, in the fifth, Bell singled. This was after
Travis Lee and Matt Williams hit back-to-back homers off reliever
Pep Harris to make it 8-1. All Bell now needed was a double. Many
of the 40,819 in attendance were aware of that. So was Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something few people have done in their careers,'' said
Bell, who is in his 10th big league season and never has done it.
``To get four hits in a game is difficult in itself. And to get
four hits in that progression is even tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Bell faced Mike Holtz, who has a pretty good
curve ball. That suited Bell's needs. You don't really try to hit a
double, but ``my doubles come when I get something I can hook down
the line,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz threw Bell a curve, a pitch he could handle. He hooked it
down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Just foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all kind of body-languaging (that),'' Showalter said.
``But it didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell went on to strike out, but he still had a productive
evening _ three hits, two runs, three RBIs _ and raised his batting
average to .237. That doesn't sound like much, but it's the highest
it's been in nearly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bell is snapping out of his usual early season doldrums.
Typically, ``April and May have never been great months for me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last several weeks I've felt a lot better. I'm swinging
the bat fairly consistently, and that's been encouraging and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell and teammates had 15 hits off four Angels pitchers and
continued to have fun at the expense of American League pitching.
On Sunday, the Diamondbacks beat Oakland, 12-4. Then they returned
home Tuesday and lost to Anaheim, 10-8. The 30 runs is the highest
three-game total of the season.
</P>
<P>
   As the Diamondbacks feasted, Daal hung around at the table. A
converted reliever who moved into the rotation when Joel Adamson
went down with a rotator-cuff injury in early May, Daal pitched
longer than he ever had before in his 16th career start.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't just quantity, but quality. The 26-year-old
Venezuelan left-hander, taken with the second pick in the second
round of the expansion draft from Toronto, gave up one earned run
and four hits in the eight innings. He struck out six and walked
none for the first time in a game he had started.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a starter, you know you have to go five, six,
seven, eight inings, so you have to combine your pitches,'' he
said. ``You throw the fastball, the change-up.''
</P>
<P>
   And a slider, which Daal said was his best pitch. He began
working that in with the change-up after sticking mostly with
fastballs and curves early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Daal fell behind Fielder, 3-0, in the seventh with two on and no
outs. He threw a change-up for a strike. Then he threw another
strike and then on 3-2 threw a nasty slider that Fielder grounded
to Bell, who started a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being a starter,'' Daal said. &QL;

RACE PANEL CHAIRWOMAN SAYS TRAFFIC STOP RACIALLY MOTIVATED
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY RUBEN NAVARRETTE JR. 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Members of Phoenix's race relations initiative expressed outrage
Wednesday over allegations that their chairwoman suffered a
humiliation they say is common for Black motorists - being detained
by police while driving a new car in a predominantly White
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that someone who is trying to solve this problem
could herself become a victim,'' said Paul Atkinson, a board member
of the ``We're All on the Same Team'' initiative. The project,
which began in November and is sponsored by the city, aims at
promoting racial harmony in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County's top cop angrily denied that his office
unfairly targets minorities and defended the traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fed up with this,'' said Sheriff Joe Arpaio. ``My deputy
stopped a car with a faulty taillight and I think he should get a
commendation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have saved lives. He did exactly what he was supposed
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arpaio said, his ``zero tolerance'' policy concerning
misbehavior by his crew includes racial prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   The chairwoman, Connie Worrell, said she was driving near
Litchfield Park on Friday morning when she noticed a sheriff's
patrol car trailing her. After what she estimated was two miles,
she was pulled over and asked for her driver's license. A sheriff's
deputy told her he had stopped her because her car's taillight was
out.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy then asked a series of questions that she considered
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me if that was my car,'' Worrell said at a press
conference Wednes day. ``And then he asked me if I lived in the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Worrell does own the 1997 Buick Century she was driving and she
does live within a few miles of the intersection where she was
stopped. Litchfield Park, which is predominantly White, is one of
the most affluent communities in the West Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell said that after she an swered the deputy's questions af
firmatively, the deputy told her that ``everything checked out''
and that she was free to go. Later, she said, she discovered that
the taillight was working properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the feeling that he thought that I didn't belong in that
neighbor hood and that I didn't belong in that car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She claimed that the traffic stop was racially motivated and sug
gested that she would not have been stopped if she were White.
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference, other members of the initiative
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a racial problem and we have to be aware of
it,'' said Tina Robbins, chairwoman of the Human Relations
Commission for the City of Phoenix, which oversees the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this had been me, I don't think this would have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The deputy, Christopher Tovar, is a recent addition to the
Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the sheriff's office denied that race played a
role in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say that this kind of thing doesn't happen,''
said Sgt. Dave Trombi. ``But I am saying that it didn't happen
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Worrell said her experience is one that is all too familiar to
many minorities. Because of that, she said, many of them view
encounters with the police with a natural apprehen sion, to which
many Whites cannot relate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have in the back of our minds that this could be a
dangerous situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the commis sion feared that the incident was
indicative of a culture that tolerates, and even encourages,
officers mak ing snap judgments about people who ``fit the
profile'' of likely offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Other city officials were also concerned, but not entirely sur
prised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all susceptible to being stopped when we are perceived
to be out of place,'' said Phoenix Councilman Cody Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``And sometimes that just means driving a nice car in a bad
neighbor hood or a not-so-nice car in a nice neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident is a local example of what some argue is a national
phenomenon _ the feeling among minorities that they are routinely
harassed by police.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in response to com plaints to lawmakers about unfair
traffic stops, the U.S. House passed a bill that would require the
Justice Department to conduct a two-year nationwide study to
determine whether Blacks are being harassed through routine vehicle
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said the ``We're All on the Same Team'' initiative
includes efforts to increase police sensitivity toward people of
different races. &QL;

KARROS ENDURES TOUGHEST YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jimmy, a first-time caller from Eagle Rock, is a
long-time Dodger hater.
</P>
<P>
   It's 5:30 in the afternoon, the Randy Johnson trade is called
off and Jimmy is ranting on Joe McDonnell's sports talk show on
1150-AM. McDonnell is doing his program from the home dugout at
Dodger Stadium and listeners aren't talking about the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   From Hideo Nomo to Rupert Murdoch to that Fox guy ``Chevy
Chase,'' who made the big Mike Piazza deal, Jimmy wants the Dodgers
exposed. He wants Eric Karros out and Mo Vaughn in.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy lobbed a few more insults into his car phone before
driving through a tunnel and out of range. As Karros walked out for
batting practice moments later, McDonnell joked, ``You're gonna
look great in a Boston uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros turned and gave the smile that has graced magazine covers
and TV commercials during his six years with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a smile rarely seen anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, the voice of the team since taking over at first base in
the middle of the 1992 season, has lowered his profile in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Karros spends most of his pre-game and post-game time
rehabilitating a surgically repaired left knee. Since the middle of
the 1997 season, in which he reached 30 homers and 100 RBI for the
third concessive year, Karros has had little to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, he misses me,'' Piazza said Thursday from
Florida, where his new team, the New York Mets, were playing one of
his old new teams, the Florida Marlins. ``He misses laughing. He
has just kind of taken a new approach in his career. He wants to be
more to himself. There is nothing wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros is 30 now, in the second year of a five-year contract
that will pay him $5 million this year. He enters tonight's series
opener against Colorado with four homers and 23 RBI. He is getting
married in November.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been several incidents that could easily have
changed his perspective.
</P>
<P>
   _ When he blasted teammate Ismael Valdes in May 1997 after a
particularly timid performance, Karros was the one who heard the
boos.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Dodgers failed to reach the playoffs and have not won a
postseason game since 1988. Karros was a leader on a team where
poor chemistry was part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ He was left unprotected by the Dodgers during last November's
expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   _ He saw his close friends Piazza and Billy Ashley leave the
team. ``It just seemed the Mike Piazza era ended in like 24
hours,'' he said. ``But that is baseball. It is a game of
adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   _ He lost his cleanup spot in the order to newcomer Bobby
Bonilla, whose left-handed bat was considered vital. Karros
returned to the cleanup spot 11 days ago after Bonilla slumped. He
is batting .305 during that span.
</P>
<P>
   _ And then the knee injury, which ended a consecutive-game
streak at 262. Although he returned just a month after doctors
repaired cartilage damage and removed bone chips, Karros came back
with a pronounced limp. Last week against St. Louis, fans booed
when he didn't dive to make a catch in foul territory.
</P>
<P>
   It raised concerns that his knee is worse than he lets on.
Karros does not deny that the knee, first injured in spring
training, had very little cartilage left even before the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But he refused to say the events of the past year have changed
him or his effort on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly things are different, no one would dispute that,''
Karros said. ``I am still the same guy. I'm just in the trainers
room so much, I don't get quoted as much. If you want to wait an
hour after the game, I'll say whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't back down on the decision to criticize of
Valdes.Karros now realizes that fans didn't want to hear from a guy
who also was struggling. Although he played all 162 games last
year, he had just 22 RBI in the first two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to be a leader in the clubhouse, you have to
be one when you are going bad, just like when you are going well,''
he said. ``To do otherwise would not be honest. I know that is an
approach that can be second- guessed, but you have to be that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in a clubhouse with so many new faces. Bonilla was
acquired for his outgoing manner as much as his switch-hitting
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been around enough to get a sense of all the
personalities,'' Karros said. ``Do we miss Mike? Yes, but we have
added a lot of quality people.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros' decision to come back so quickly from his injury has
also raised some eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to miss two months, Karros was back in one. Doctors
weren't surprised, knowing his work ethic. Before the surgery,
there was more swelling than pain. Afterward, he hopped on an
exercise bike and just kept going.
</P>
<P>
   Karros says now that he probably should have taken two or three
months off, ``But I'm not going to do that now,'' he said. ``I
guess that is my excessive, compulsive nature coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   Team orthopedist Frank Jobe, who assisted Dr. Ralph Gambardella
on the 2{-hour procedure in late March, sees the competitive nature
of athletes daily.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the shoulder surgery he performed Thursday on Dodgers
outfielder Todd Hollandsworth, Jobe said Karros was able to come
back quicker because the knee had more support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always concerned,'' Jobe said. ``But he didn't have much
pain and much swelling before. The body's mechanism is telling him
something. When he has to really turn it on right now, that can be
a problem. But we wouldn't let him out there if we thought he could
do further damage.''

ABOUT 9 IN 10 AT SKY HARBOR MEET JET NOISE STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether you believe your ears or not, quieter jet engines have
become the norm at Sky Harbor International Airport, where nearly
nine out of 10 planes have achieved stricter federal standards for
noise.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of next year, all commercial aircraft are to be
equipped with quieter engines, according to a Federal Aviation
Authority mandate. At Sky Harbor, 86 percent of the planes already
meet that standard, airport officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem: Some residents in the airport's flight path
say they aren't hearing the results. Mary Vrizuela, for example,
said she hasn't noticed a hush over her north Tempe neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the noise levels are louder,'' said Vrizuela, a
lifelong resident of the Riverside neighborhood, due east of Sky
Harbor. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``They're just too close to the house. They need to go down the
river bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In the adjoining Sunset neighborhood, Arnold Ramirez has a
similar complaint. &UR; Perhaps engines are getting quieter, he said,
but it doesn't do a lot of good if planes fly off course.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``There's times you have to keep the door closed because you
can't hear the TV,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, standing in his front yard, with midday air traffic
passing overhead, Ramirez was able to carry on a conversation
without interruption.
</P>
<P>
   For years, residents of neighborhoods in north Tempe, central
Phoenix and elsewhere have complained about loud jets taking off
and landing at Sky Harbor. Federal officials say they can't
describe exactly how much less noise the new engines make. But they
say the engines definitely are quieter than the old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Now, airport officials say, the challenge is to keep the planes
in their proper flight paths as they land and take off from the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Planes departing to the east are supposed to follow the Salt
River bed until they reach Price Road, said John Solomon, assistant
aviation director for Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The city's flight-track monitoring system reports that during
the past four months, 95 percent of the flights departing to the
east stayed on course.
</P>
<P>
   To try and boost that figure, airport officials next week will
begin sending notices to pilots who deviate from the flight plan,
Solomon said. The idea is to serve as a reminder that there are
strict rules for approaching and leaving Sky Harbor, whose air
traffic makes it the busiest two-runway airport in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, signs are going up at the runways' eastern ends to
remind pilots of the departure path, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those procedures, coupled with the quieter plane engines, should
actually shrink the area around the airport where noise is most
severe, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Sky Harbor's 86 percent rate puts it ahead of the national rate.
As of the end of 1997, 80 percent of the planes operating in the
U.S. were equipped with the quieter engines, said Mitch Barker, an
FAA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Many airlines and engine manufacturers say they'll easily meet
the Dec. 31, 1999, deadline for the new engine-noise requirements.
</P>
<P>
   At America West Airlines, 83 percent of the fleet already meets
the new noise requirements, said Ron Aramini, senior vice president
of operations.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the airline will start retrofitting 14 of its
737-200s with ``hush kits,'' which are designed to make older
engines meet the FAA standards. Four older planes will be retired
before the deadline, Aramini said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the airline's fleet is relatively new and came
equipped with the quieter Stage 3 engines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Engine manufacturer General Electric said the noise requirements
aren't an issue anymore. All new planes are built to that standard,
or higher, said Rick Kennedy, manager of media relations for GE
Aircraft Engines.
</P>
<P>
   Europe may be driving the push to even quieter engines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have such congestion in those cities,'' he said of
crowded European centers. &QL;

ONE PRO BASKETBALL: MALONE HAS LED THIS SERIES NOWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ You wanted it to be a compelling series filled with
drama, passion and big shots at the buzzer. Instead, we have Karl
Malone and his assembled troupe on the world stage playing the
roles of fine actors from a small repertory theater, miles from
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The only intriguing subplot Friday at the United Center is what
will Dennis Rodman wear to the parade? If Michael Jordan and
Scottie Pippen win their sixth title in eight seasons _ and leading
3 games to 1, they are almost a lock _ a great run in modern sports
history will be properly saluted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the confetti stops raining down at the United Center
around midnight, it will be the yawning climax to one of the
National Basketball Association's most turbulent and troubled
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Labor strife.
</P>
<P>
   Young knuckleheads playing for themselves instead of their
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Miami and New York's warped views of manhood.
</P>
<P>
   A dynasty so bored with watching the peasants flail at one
another, it needed to create internal dissension just to make
winning interesting again. On it went for several months, the
league drowning in egos and excess and the unthinkable: Michael is
really leaving?
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, along came the playoffs and the Jazz, a team of
savvy veterans and a nice mix of young players that shared the ball
and cared about playing defense. They didn't have the highest
payroll nor did they have the most talent, but the sum of all their
parts was good enough to supposedly give the Bulls their stiffest
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   They had a coach who shot from the hip, two future Hall of
Famers, Malone and John Stockton, who had the same type of John
Elway-sentiment working for them as they forever plied their trade
without a title. They also had a lot of fairly anonymous guys who
did not try to call attention to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In a league of booming individualism and merchandising, they
were that interesting concept: a team.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here they are, one game from going home to Salt Lake City.
They have not been humbled so much as humiliated, losing Game 3 by
42 points, blowing uncontested layups and failing to block out for
rebounds in the final minutes of Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think failure is the right word,'' Malone said
Wednesday. He added that he did not think you can measure a
successful career by whether you win a championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the team with the two best players in the game is always
unbeatable. Maybe depth and having a great bench mean little when
the game is on the line in the finals. Maybe having the most
accomplished player in the world always beats having two aging
All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   You get few chances in your career to win the ultimate prize,
and the Jazz has come up so short it's almost as if the players do
not believe they can beat Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Utah Coach Jerry Sloan admitted Thursday he has stayed with
several of his reserves too long, waiting for results that never
came. But give Bulls Coach Phil Jackson credit. He has pushed all
the right buttons after losing Game 1 in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is not merely about matchups and Pippen creating
havoc on defense. When you keep missing five-footers and free
throws, when perhaps the greatest power forward to play the game
does not beg for the ball in the clutch, something else is at work.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about Reggie Miller, but he and the Pacers did
not back down. They showed emotion after a big victory and stood up
to the Bulls with the sincere belief that they were just as
deserving Eastern Conference champions before falling in seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   Utah? Malone has had the personality of a three-minute egg in
these finals, bowing his head instead of pumping his fist,
answering an authoritative Jordan dunk on one end with an
off-the-mark 15-footer on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone has to show some kind of emotion out there,'' said the
reserve center Greg Foster. Forget the good-guy image and all that
stuff. I don't buy into that. Yeah, sure, there is a sportsmanship.
You don't want to go out there and do anything dirty. But you got
to play physical and you've got to play with emotion, especially in
the finals. It seems to me we're playing tentative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz did not have to beat the Bulls to be a good story, but
Utah could have given us a decent series. It would been a nice
cleansing device after all the monotonous courtroom drama, fines
and suspensions that crippled the NBA this season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we get the Bulls in a stampede again. The multinational
conglomerate grows, the small businesses suffer and a July lockout
is looming.
</P>
<P>
   Great game, huh?

SAME HOCKEY GAME FROM DISPARATE CAMERA ANGLES
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whose hockey would you rather watch? Fox's or CBC's?
The heretic's broadcast or the traditionalist's? While most of us
cannot view the Canadian Broadcasting Company's telecasts, a few
cognoscenti have written or called to say CBC produces hockey games
the way it should be done.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is not being judged because Fox and CBC represent
near-polar opposites in production philosophies. CBC has been
producing ``Hockey Night in Canada'' for nearly 50 years, Fox has
carried hockey for four years and ESPN for nine.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to compare Fox and ESPN, but not in the ways they
broadcast the same game. Fox and CBC show the same game
simultaneously (as in Game 1 of the National Hockey League finals
Tuesday). ESPN and CBC also telecast the same game simultaneously
(like Game 2 Thursday night). But Fox and ESPN never do.
</P>
<P>
   So the decision here was to examine the impact of each network's
differing production styles, using the first period of Game 1 as a
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   But first, a few words about their philosophies:
</P>
<P>
   ``In hockey, we need to be spectacular to get interest,'' said
Sandy Grossman, Fox's lead hockey director. ``Hockey on TV doesn't
excite people the way it does when they see it live. So I try to
take risks, but they're usually calculated risks, even if once in a
while I get burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Said John Shannon, ``Hockey Night's'' executive producer: ``We
live in a country with a party called the Progressive
Conservatives. We see innovation, but people expect things out of
us that we can't change.''
</P>
<P>
   The easiest measure of the differences between Fox and CBC is to
calculate how much time is spent covering the game from the high
center ice camera, which provides a safe, standard view of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Fox employed that view 50 times in the first period,
for 14 minutes 25 seconds. CBC used it 42 times, but for 18:12,
holding to the view for as long as 1:40. Fox never held it for more
than 48 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Fox employs robotic cameras mounted behind the goal and along
the sideboards overlooking the face-off circles, to capture
close-up action in the corners, behind the goal, and to peer from
behind or in front at power plays.
</P>
<P>
   Fox used those cameras 40 times for 5:12 in the period. CBC cut
23 times for 1:19 to what seemed to be a combination of Fox's
angles, to which it has access, and its own hand-held cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent cuts to robotic cameras like Fox's are generally
avoided by CBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't cut, you have more of a chance of seeing the
puck,'' Shannon said. ``That equation works for us. We let the high
camera tell the story. When the whistle blows, we'll get you inside
the game with replays.''
</P>
<P>
   The different styles can provide dramatically different viewing
experiences, such as Detroit's second goal late in the period by
Nicklas Lidstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of a commercial, Fox was primed to cover a face-off
from the robotic camera mounted above the goal. The camera followed
the action for 36 seconds. Grossman never cut away, a potentially
dangerous strategy; the farther the puck moves from the goal, the
harder it is to see it, and the likelier that the puck and shooter
could move out of the camera's frame.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Yzerman's pass to Lindstrom stayed within the frame.
``It was like everybody stepped aside to let me see the goal,''
Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, CBC stuck to its high center ice camera for 36
seconds, cutting to an angle like Fox's only for a replay of
Lidstrom's goal.
</P>
<P>
   A Fox tool used by neither CBC nor ESPN is the FoxTrax cartoon
comet tail that ignites a puck blue or orange depending on shot
speed. In that first period, the puck was illuminated blue 39
times, and orange seven times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of like the comet streaks,'' said Shannon, uttering
sacrilege to Canadian purists.
</P>
<P>
   On 16 occasions, FoxTrax displayed a white, computer-generated
version of the puck whenever it moved out of camera view along the
sideboards.
</P>
<P>
   You will never see comet tails or computerized pucks on CBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``CBC does a very solid job, but I've just got a different
attitude toward the way hockey should be covered,'' said Grossman,
who also directs Fox's top football games. ``It's not right or
wrong, it's what you want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann's Apology
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, ESPN and Keith Olbermann were at war. He left
``Sportscenter'' on a wave of acrimony so bitter it puzzled ESPN,
where he made his name. Thursday, he apologized, not for leaving,
but for being nasty. In a commentary on the SportsFan Radio
Network, he said: ``I'm not backing off from some of my criticisms,
but I am very sorry, and I am publicly apologizing, to my former
colleagues and employers there that it all got messy. For me, a lot
of it was simply this: I had a lot of fun on that show and a big
part of me didn't want to go, and I wasn't mature enough to deal
with it any other way.''  &QL;

MOUNT RAINIER AVALANCHE STRIKES CLIMBERS; 11 ARE RESCUED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A dozen climbers nearly 12,000 feet up Mount Rainier
were caught in an avalanche on Thursday afternoon near a rock
formation called Disappointment Cleaver. Six climbers were able to
stop their falls and were uninjured, while the others, attached to
the same rope, were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Five of those had been pulled to safety by 8 p.m. and had minor
injuries; the climber who had fallen the farthest, and was most
likely hurt the most, was still out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've accounted for everyone, but that's not
confirmed,'' said Dawn Adams, a spokeswoman for the National Park
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The park service said late on Thursday night that one man was
dead, but his identity was not available.
</P>
<P>
   Of the injured climbers, one had a knee injury, two had injured
hands and a couple were suffering from hypothermia, Ms. Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 were being led by Rainier Mountaineering, the only
guiding company that operates on that side of the mountain, she
said. They were descending when the avalanche hit; it was not clear
if they had reached the summit of the 14,410-foot peak, about 60
miles southeast of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   About 2:30 p.m. rangers were notified of the accident by another
climber on the mountain who was using a cellular phone. Rescuers
reached the climbers within an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The large rock formation, which splits the Emmons and Ingraham
Glaciers, is at 11,500 feet and is named Disappointment Cleaver
because many people who fail to reach the summit turn around at
that point, said Gus Bush, operations leader for Tacoma Mountain
Rescue, which sent 12 volunteers to assist.
</P>
<P>
   The injured climbers appeared to have gone over an edge and
stopped their fall with their ice axes, said a park spokesman, Dave
Uberuaga, but they were on too steep a slope to return to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue had been hampered by weather, with a low cloud
ceiling that made it difficult to dispatch helicopters to the
mountain. Most of the injured climbers were walking around,
Uberuaga said.
</P>
<P>
   As more rescuers reach the scene, the search would continue on
for people who might be underneath the snow. Search dogs had been
called to the scene, Uberuaga said, adding that he did not know how
many other parties were climbing today.
</P>
<P>
   Spring snow often turns to a slushy consistency, especially in
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat today and the sun coming down on it, probably
triggered it,'' Bush said. Temperatures have recently reached the
upper 70s and lower 80s.
</P>
<P>
   The worst climbing accident on Mount Rainier occurred on June
21, 1981, when 11 people died in an ice fall at 11,000 feet on a
guided climb.

GRAMMY IS SINGING L.A. TUNE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And the Grammy goes to ... Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Grammy Awards will return to the Shrine Auditorium next
year, and the city is negotiating to host the music industry's
biggest night out again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on the 41st annual ceremony in 1999 is expected
in a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   City officials are angling for an agreement from the National
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to bring the televised
ceremony in 2000 to Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. The
$300 million, 20,000-seat Staples Center should be completed by
October 1999, in time for a New Year's Eve celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The Grammys take place the last week of February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to work closely with (NARAS president)
Michael Greene on the Grammys in 2000,'' said Cody Cluff, a member
of the L.A. Sports &AMP; Entertainment Commission, a mayoral appointed
board that tries to attract sports and entertainment events to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Cluff said the city wants a two-year commitment from NARAS to
ensure Los Angeles hosts the ceremony in 2000, but a final decision
isn't expected until after the 1999 event.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles _ home to the majority of the academy's 9,000 voting
members and major record labels _ hosted the Grammys at the
6,300-seat Shrine for seven of the past 13 years but lost the big
show to New York in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This year's 40th annual gala took place Feb. 25 at Radio City
Music Hall. Two weeks before the event, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani became embroiled in a tiff with Greene and said he didn't
care if the Grammys never returned to the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   If the Staples Center works out to everyone's satisfaction, the
awards show may never have to go back to the city that never
sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan is confident that once the
Grammys are held in the new arena, ``they will never have to leave
Los Angeles again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The venue, which soon will be the new home to the Los Angeles
Kings, Clippers and Lakers sports teams, is located on what was the
North Hall of the Convention Center at 11th Street and Figueroa
Avenue.

`NENTH' INNING BELONGS TO GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM KEOWN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
  
  Robb Nen is the closest thing baseball has to an arcade game. He
throws, the numbers flash and everybody gasps. There always have
been questions in Robb Nen's life, and the answer was always the
same: Throw harder.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With an arm like that, who could blame him for relying a little
too much on power? If that was your arm, you'd air it out, too. If
that was your arm, you might charge people money to touch it.
</P>
<P>
   So, if faced with a tough patch in the ninth inning, with
everybody in the building standing there, watching you, what would
you do? Simple: You'd try to blow the circuit on the radar gun.
</P>
<P>
   But the arm, important as it is, obscures many things about Nen.
For one thing, he isn't flashy. Unlike some uncommonly hard
throwers _ Baltimore's Armando Benitez is the most notorious
offender _ Nen doesn't throw the ball and then stare at the numbers
on the scoreboard, hoping to see the magical 100.
</P>
<P>
   The best closer in the National League knows the numbers lie. He
knows it doesn't matter that much. ``If you get to the big leagues,
you can hit a 100 mph fastball,'' Nen says. ``I know not to get too
excited about how hard I'm throwing. I know it can be hit. Believe
me, I've seen it get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't seen it much this year. Nen has 19 saves and a 1.30
ERA. He's getting through the ninth inning _ the ``Nenth'' inning,
as the budding slogan goes _ with machine-like efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to believe, but Nen wasn't a sure thing last year. He
was often a wreck, unable to bend his mind around a walk or a hit.
When bad things happened to good pitches, he couldn't get over it.
He thought too much about his mechanics, and if you've ever seen
him throw you know how utterly mad that could make a person.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Nen was working without a breaking pitch. His slider,
creator of so many of his 53 strikeouts this season, was on a
year-long sabbatical. He doesn't know where it went, only that it
came back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're only able to get one pitch over, you're going to get
hit,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It seems everything positive with the Giants eventually funnels
its way back to the manager's office. Nen worked for Jim Leyland in
Florida, and while Leyland's baseball acumen is top-flight, his
nervousness and anxiety often get the best of him. He might not be
the best guy to work for if your livelihood depends on getting his
team out of the tough situations.
</P>
<P>
   So here's what Dusty Baker's calm, confident style has meant to
Nen: ``It's a lot easier to go out there and take the ball when
you've got a guy behind you pulling for you. He makes you want to
say, `Hey, thanks for putting me out there.'''
</P>
<P>
   At his current pace, Nen will throw more than 100 innings this
year. He's never thrown more than 83; he had 74 last year. It isn't
an issue right now. It might become one in August or September, but
for now Nen says the extra workload has helped him. His slider is
nastier and harder than ever, his mechanics are locked in and his
control is so good he's walking certain hitters semi-intentionally,
as he did Tuesday night with Seattle's Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say no, and even harder to say no to Baker. You
can't cash the big checks and shake the hands and do the interviews
and then take the ball only when your world is perfectly aligned.
You do that and teammates start looking at you funny and your
manager starts dropping subtle hints about courage and manhood and
the individual sacrifices that go toward making a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to pitch,'' Nen says, shrugging. ``I get paid a lot
of money to go out there when I'm needed. If he needs me, I'm
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker doesn't harbor the jealousies that reside in the minds of
so many other managers. The career minor-leaguer who rose through
the ranks to get a big-league job often expects too much. He sees
his own job _ all that work and sweat and bus rides _ out there on
the line every time some overpriced prima donna gives up a
game-winning homer.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an incongruous element of Baker's style: He can't
bring himself to let a game go. He can't stand the idea of losing a
game with his best relievers sitting idle.
</P>
<P>
   Most managers draw the line at three straight appearances for
their closer. Baker doesn't have such hard and fast rules. It's
understood that Nen will ask for a day off when he needs one _ he
has done so more than once this season _ but sometimes it's just
too damned hard to tell Baker no.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Nen wants to be out there as much as possible. He wants
to ride this thing out. He's no longer standing out there tensing
every time a runner gets on base. He's no longer looking into the
dugout, trying to read bad thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dusty doesn't put added pressure on you from the dugout,'' Nen
says. ``I was always trying to be better than I needed to be. On
this team, it's easy to remember there are eight other guys out
there working together to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no fun to go out and pitch like last year, always
wondering what was going to happen. The way things are working this
year makes it a lot more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Nen catches himself. He's a closer, after all. Life goes up and
down with no advance warning. Did he say fun?
</P>
<P>
   `` &LR; More  &LR; fun,'' he says. ``Not easy, just more fun.''

RED WINGS DEFEAT CAPITALS IN OVERTIME, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Red Wings took a 2 games to 0 lead over the
Washington Capitals in the Stanley Cup finals on Thursday night
with a 5-4 victory in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit won it on a goal by Kris Draper at 15 minutes 24 seconds
of extra time after the Wings' Martin Lapointe stole a pass in the
right corner. He fired the puck across the slot to Draper, who
redirected it past goalie Olaf Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still possible for Detroit to squander its chance at a
second straight championship. After all, the Red Wings squandered
an early lead on Thursday night before coming back.
</P>
<P>
   They could get overconfident as they head to Washington for
Games 3 and 4. Their erratic goaltender, Chris Osgood, could let
them down, as he did on Thursday night. They could suffer one or
more key injuries, as they did on Thursday night when Slava Kozlov,
one of Detroit's best attackers, left the game in the second period
with a leg injury after being hip-checked by Sergei Gonchar, a
Washington defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   And they could lose four games of the next four or five to a
team that finished fourth in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this is not likely. What is more probable is that the
Red Wings will become the first team since the 1992 Pittsburgh
Penguins to repeat as champions, possibly without having to return
to Joe Louis Arena. They put themselves in this position by erasing
two two-goal deficits before prevailing in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   This was a frantic and furious game, with moments of
controversy, sloppy play and brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 4-2 near the midway mark of the third period,
despite two goals by the captain, Steve Yzerman, Detroit rallied
with goals by Lapointe and Doug Brown to tie the score at 4-4 with
just over four minutes remaining. In the final minutes of
regulation, the Wings stormed the net of Kolzig, but he either
stopped their shots or survived them when they whistled wide.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals, who had won their five previous overtime games in
this tournament, got goals from Peter Bondra, Chris Simon, Adam
Oates and Joe Juneau.
</P>
<P>
   The last team to win the cup after losing the first two games of
the championship round was the Montreal Canadiens in 1971 over
Chicago. In the past three seasons, the team winning the first two
games of the finals has gone on to sweep. Detroit did it last
spring over Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   As they did in Tuesday night's 2-1 victory, the Red Wings scored
first. This one was by Steve Yzerman, the Detroit captain, who came
into the game with 21 points in the post-season, the most of any
National Hockey League player. Yzerman put his own rebound past
Kolzig at 7 minutes 49 seconds of the first period after Tomas
Holmstrom made the play possible, digging the puck out of the
corner with great effort.
</P>
<P>
   Holmstrom, who came into the game with 16 playoff points, fourth
on the Red Wings, had assisted on both Detroit goals in Game 1.
Getting the other assist on Yzerman's goal was Nicklas Lidstrom,
the defenseman who came into the game with 18 points, second on the
Wings.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings outshot the Capitals by 14-8 in the first period and
dominated them. Unlike Game 1, the pace of play didn't stop and go,
with many whistles.
</P>
<P>
   But the wind began blowing in a different direction early in the
second period, and the Capitals scored three consecutive goals on
Osgood to hold a 3-1 lead at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The first was most unusual and will be discussed at length for
some time. It was scored by Bondra at 1:51 on a shot from a sharp
angle in the left-wing circle. He put it past Osgood, who was
standing still, as if he thought play had stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals had cleared the puck from their zone with an
aimless long, hard pass by Jeff Brown. It was the kind of play that
often ends up ruled as icing, as long as the other team touches the
puck behind its own goal line. However, as the puck traveled up the
middle, it was touched by Andrei Nikolishin of Washington, who was
in the neutral zone, between the blue lines. This didn't negate an
offside, but it did take away the possibility of offsides should
the puck be reached first by a Capital.
</P>
<P>
   The puck carried on over the goal line that crosses the pipes of
Osgood's net. And none of his teammates touched the puck. Bondra
got to it first and quickly fired, shocking the Red Wings, who
argued with referee Don Koharski before the faceoff. The gaffe was
another embarrassment for Osgood, an unproven goalie who has given
up three goals this spring on long shots from outside the blue
line, one in each of the previous three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone remained stunned, the Capitals got two more goals
within 10 minutes. Chris Simon made it 2-1 at 6:11 by beating
Osgood on a rebound, high on the glove side. Oates made it 3-1 by
shooting to the same spot after splitting the defense of Larry
Murphy and Lidstrom. &QL;

JORDAN IS THE MYTH _ AND PIPPEN'S THE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE JENKINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; CHICAGO _ They seemed so small and insignificant up there,
answering the media's questions with hollow eyes and a shrug.
Forever in tandem, John Stockton and Karl Malone did their press
conference together, but they could have mailed it in. These were
two superstars who had been stripped of their humor, their patience
and their conviction.
</P>
<P>
   A little earlier, Michael Jordan had been at the podium, talking
about ``taking their heart'' and ``sticking in the knife, then
twisting it a little.'' The words, so tenderly spoken, seemed
chilling in retrospect. That's when you realized that Stockton and
Malone have not really failed. They're just two more faces in the
crowd of Jordan's victims.
</P>
<P>
   It never has mattered whether they're small-town, like Stockton
and Malone,or big-city, like Magic Johnson. Against Jordan and the
city of Chicago, they're all the same. Every series is Rome vs.
Turlock. Magic, Barkley, Drexler, Payton, Malone _ whoever. Makes
no difference. Olajuwon and Shaq would have gone down, too.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday night comes the coronation. Everybody's thinking
Sandy Koufax and Jim Brown just now, the highest standards of
retirement from sports, and if this is Jordan's final bow, he might
play one for the ages, give us something to remember along with the
right-to-left reverse layup against the Lakers, the unconscious
3-point barrage against Portland and the sick-as-a-dog classic
against Utah in last year's Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's all thoroughly understood. Jordan is
basketball's Pele, its Muhammad Ali, a myth among mortals. You
won't accept his retirement until he puts it in writing. You know
Jordan's story by heart because it's part of your soul. Once you
advance to other relevant topics of these NBA Finals, you shoot
right past Stockton and Malone. You go directly to Pippen _ not
only the MVP of this series so far, but also the key to Chicago's
future as an NBA dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tyrannical nature of owner Jerry Reinsdorf and GM
Jerry Krause, this is still a game of options. A champagne-soaked
Phil Jackson could mutter ``bygones'' to Krause, give him a big hug
and come back next year. Jordan has hedged on his feelings so many
times, you can't imagine him actually leaving Chicago. But Pippen
seems thoroughly packed, halfway to the horizon in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   And if he leaves, it's all over. No matter what anyone else
does.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Jordan could have persevered without Pippen.
Such is the magnitude of his power; each teammate becomes 50
percent better. But Jordan is 35 now, incapable of seizing every
single game by the throat. He's been magnificent in this series but
not otherworldly, not as we've seen him before. Imagine Jordan next
fall, at the start of camp, looking at the Longleys and Kerrs and
Harpers and some new free agent in Pippen's slot. Names have been
tossed around: Jayson Williams, Charles Barkley, even Derrick
Coleman. None of them sound right.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else in basketball flows at the power-forward position
like Pippen: canning 3-pointers in bunches, dunking savagely in
traffic, crafting the sweetest long-range bank shots since Julius
Erving, breaking hearts with his offensive rebounds, throwing an
octopus-like defense at the opposition. When they asked Utah coach
Sloan about Dennis Rodman the other night, he gave a disgusted,
deadpan answer. When Pippen's name came up, Sloan called him
``sensational'' and ``terrific'' and generally the answer to any
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jordan nor Jackson has given a hard-and-fast clue about
the future. Pippen seems 100 percent gone, already wandering the
marketplace of free-agent riches. For years he's been the league's
most outrageously underpaid player, and his disgust for Reinsdorf
and Krause stems from pure hatred. ``I'm just trying to get through
one more game, so I can pack that uniform in a trunk,'' he says,
bitterly. ``I don't have any intention of coming back. This is the
last run.''
</P>
<P>
   A few other observations on the eve of a clincher:
</P>
<P>
   _Watching a replay of NBC's Game 4 broadcast, we were struck by
the candor and insights of Isiah Thomas. He's no David Brinkley,
but he flat-out predicted that Rodman would make those two free
throws with 43.8 seconds left, because he knows Rodman has the
stuff of greatness. And he jumped all over Karl Malone, who played
the fourth quarter in a passing and pick-setting haze. ``Right
now,'' said Isiah, ``Karl should be  &LR; demanding  &LR; the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone did nothing of the sort. Everyone else was stepping up;
Howard Eisley, Shandon Anderson, Bryon Russell, even Antoine Carr
and Chris Morris. They all hit big shots. Malone barely attempted
one, let alone put it down.
</P>
<P>
   _You have to laugh at critics suggesting that Rodman's off-court
adventures _ and the fact that he gets away with them _ will set a
dubious standard for impressionable kids. Folks, there's only one
Rodman _ this century and next. Forget the excuses and late-night
cavorting. Start with the rouge, the lipstick, the multicolored
hair. Nobody's ever gone that far. He's beyond ``role model.'' He
comes from Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   _Also kind of amusing: The Utah shuffle of centers: Greg
Ostertag, Greg Foster and, lately, the impossibly earnest Adam
Keefe. Memo to Sloan: New look next year. All of these guys are
horrible.
</P>
<P>
   _No team has come from 3-1 down to win the NBA Finals, and the
Jazz won't reverse the trend. But Bill Russell's Celtics once beat
Wilt Chamberlain's 76ers in that predicament. Larry Bird came back
to beat Erving. It was only the Eastern Conference finals, but in
those days, when real teams roamed the landscape, the task was
infinitely more difficult than anything we've seen in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   _The tributes to Jordan run nonstop. It's too easy to say he's
the greatest of all-time; comments lean more toward the esoteric.
Jayson Williams had a pretty good one the other day. He called
Jordan ``Jesus in tennis shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's scary to think what he might have in store Friday night.

CRITICISM OF A'S IS MISSING THE MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   By GLENN DICKEY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The A's have been getting advice from their media critics
lately. Fortunately for them, they haven't paid attention.
</P>
<P>
   The first bit of advice was to draft J.D. Drew and call the
bluff of Drew's agent, Scott Boras. That would have been wasting a
draft pick because the A's never would have been able to pay what
Drew and Boras are demanding, and they would have been involved in
protracted, rancorous negotiations, which would have sidelined Drew
for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Boras is trying to abolish the baseball draft. In fact, he might
accomplish exactly the opposite because there is sentiment within
baseball to try to negotiate a ``rookie salary cap'' with the
Players Association, as NBA owners have done.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Drew is being used as a pawn, turning down a
$2.6 million bonus and holding out all last season after being
drafted by Philadelphia. The only conclusions to be drawn are that
Drew is (1) stupid; (2) greedy; or (3) both. The A's are better off
without this rockhead.
</P>
<P>
   (Chad Hutchinson has also cost himself money and possibly a
development year by aligning with Boras. He would have been a
first-round pick if he'd had another agent, but clubs don't want to
deal with Boras, understandably, so Hutchinson slipped to the
second round. He won't get the offer he wanted, so he might be
forced to play another season of football, a sport in which he has
no professional future. You'd think a Stanford athlete would be
smarter than that.)
</P>
<P>
   Now the A's are being castigated because they sold Kurt Abbott
to the Colorado Rockies. We're hearing again of their ``bottom-line
mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, the A's acquired veterans to shore up their
pitching staff _ Kenny Rogers, Tom Candiotti and Mike Fetters _ and
to keep some positions warm while their prospects were developing.
Mike Blowers, for instance, is playing third base, but Eric Chavez,
hitting well over .300 with 15 homers at Huntsville in Double A,
probably will be there next season.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott was part of that plan, because the A's didn't think
Miguel Tejada was ready. But Abbott had played so poorly at
shortstop that the A's rushed Tejada, injured in the spring, to the
majors as soon as he got healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott is a versatile player and a good hitter. He is valuable
to a contending team, especially one that can afford a $1 million
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Does any of that describe this year's A's team? Of course not.
With or without Abbott, the A's are not going to rise above third
place in their division this year, and he had no part in their
future.
</P>
<P>
   The A's are sticking to their master plan of developing young
players. Though the media emphasis has been on their low
major-league payroll, the more important factor at the moment is
the money they're putting into scouting and the minor-league
system.
</P>
<P>
   This emphasis is not new. The A's had consecutive Rookies of the
Year in Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire and Walt Weiss when the late
Walter Haas owned the team, and most of the players who have been
coming up were signed when Haas still owned the team.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been impressive. Four of the five infielders
are farm products, and Chavez could be the fifth next season. Two
of the three outfielders are recent farm products; Rickey
Henderson, of course, also came out of the A's system _ when
Charles Finley owned the team.
</P>
<P>
   The group has star quality, too, with players like Ben Grieve,
Jason Giambi and Tejada. Ryan Christenson is an outstanding
defensive center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   In their past two drafts, the A's have emphasized pitching,
which will be slower to develop, and they've acquired two
potentially outstanding pitchers in trades, Jimmy Haynes and Blake
Stein.
</P>
<P>
   The key for the A's will come when their young players get to
the arbitration phase of their careers, when their salaries will
jump. Giambi is there now, and the A's made a pre-emptive strike in
April to sign him to an extended contract.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has been that the payroll will increase as attendance
does, but I doubt it will work quite that neatly. Fans won't come
out until the team is a contender; the development phase doesn't
interest them. Owners Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann will have to
boost their payroll to sign the young stars, or the A's will become
another Montreal, developing young players for the richer teams.
</P>
<P>
   If the A's owners allow their team to fall into the Montreal
mode, they'll deserve any criticism they get. But telling them they
should draft J.D. Drew or keep Kurt Abbott at this point makes no
sense.

 (Subs item about Quentin Tarantino to correct location of
restaurant) (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This sounds like a headline her grandfather would have printed:
PATRICIA HEARST bares all, or almost all. But Ms. Hearst's
striptease was not for a newspaper story; it was for the JOHN
WATERS film ``Pecker,'' which is scheduled to be released in the
fall. She plays an art collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day that Patricia Hearst arrived in Baltimore to start
work on this movie,'' said JEREMY WALKER, a spokesman for Waters,
``she went to his house. She undid the dress that she brought. It
dropped to the floor and she was wearing the slip that she's
wearing in the movie, and she said, `How's this?' John said, `It's
perfect.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hearst, who was kidnapped in 1974 and convicted of robbing a
bank with her captors, has been in the headlines this week because
a New Yorker magazine article said she had been the object of a
federal drug investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry began when a suspicious package was delivered to her
Connecticut home several months ago. Ms. Hearst called the local
police, but federal agents arrived; later they said they had been
tipped off that the package held narcotics. The New Yorker said Ms.
Hearst thought someone was trying to hurt her chances for a
presidential pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of Chivalry
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ QUENTIN TARANTINO, who parlayed his interest in crime
novels into such films as ``Pulp Fiction,'' was arrested Thursday
for assault. The charges stem from a fracas last month at a
restaurant in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Tarantino argued with LEILA MWANGI, who
witnesses said was complaining about the way black people were
portrayed in his highly stylized films. Apparently Tarantino did
not take her criticisms well and struck her with his fist, said
DETECTIVE JOSEPH PENTANGELO, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A Family Uncorks
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a bit of a mystery at a dinner at La
Caravelle restaurant in Manhattan on Thursday night celebrating the
300th anniversary of Krug Clos du Mesnil champagne: How could there
be a tricentennial if the Krug family did not begin producing wine
until 1843?
</P>
<P>
   ``The vineyard itself was indeed established in 1698,'' said
CAROLINE KRUG, 32, the company's heiress-apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, oui. ``Our catalog states this chronology clearly,'' said
MICHAEL BROADBENT, chairman of the international wine department at
Christie's, the Manhattan auction house, which is scheduled to
auction 27 lots of Clos du Mesnil on Friday for up to $600 a
magnum.
</P>
<P>
   Music Notes
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It sounded like Christmas in June at the annual
dinner of the Songwriters' Hall of Fame on Wednesday: FREDDY COLE,
the younger brother of Nat King Cole, performed ``The Christmas
Song'' (``Chestnuts roasting on an open fire ...'') in honor of MEL
TORME, who wrote it. They screamed and squealed the way they did in
the old days.
</P>
<P>
   But the 200 Menudo groupies who greeted the Latin teen-age
sensation at La Guardia Airport on Thursday are grown-ups now. The
quintet was arriving for the Puerto Rican Day parade on Sunday. ``I
guess they've grown up a little bit,'' said one fan, GAIL COLON,
who admitted to having done some growing up herself. ``But they're
still my age.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity Spotting
</P>
<P>
   BEN CRENSHAW, the two-time Masters champion, was seen at the
East Hampton Point restaurant in East Hampton, N.Y., with BONNIE
BISTRIAN and her husband, BEN KRUPINSKI, the contractor to the
stars who labored on Martha Stewart's 24-room house and is also an
owner of East Hampton Point. Were they planning a golf date? Ms.
Bistrian and her brother, Barry, want to build a golf course, but
environmentalists have raised objections.

<P>
   Perhaps you noticed that a soccer tournament started in France
this week. Never mind the riots, never mind the strikes, say the
organizers, prepare to enjoy one of the world's great festivals of
sport.
</P>
<P>
   During the next few weeks men all over the planet will regress
to traditional patterns of behavior, slumping in front of their
television sets, neglecting their household duties.
</P>
<P>
   True aficionados will abandon their families and travel to
France, perhaps with tickets to games, but probably not, thanks to
the French authorities _ and preferably not, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   The mark of a true fan is to travel to a stadium without means
of admission, hand over the next year's housekeeping payments to a
scalper and receive in return a forged ticket that will be rejected
at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   That's devotion to the game. We admire it as much as the next
man.
</P>
<P>
   That's right: we said ``man.''
</P>
<P>
   Careful studies, albeit controversial in some quarters, suggest
that most football fans are male. Increasingly these days, women
may affect an interest in the game, but on closer examination they
turn out to be mainly interested in men, either off the field or
on, not in the sport itself.
</P>
<P>
   That is as it should be. But what is only now coming to be
understood, thanks to new scientific research, is the terrible
price that men pay for their devotion, and the shocking biological
advantage that women derive from indulging it.
</P>
<P>
   Men are literally killing themselves for love of the game _ and
women are cheering them on.
</P>
<P>
   It is a well-known fact that women live longer than men. But
scientists have long puzzled over why this should be. Biologically
speaking, childbirth makes perceptibly greater demands on women
than on men: you might expect female life expectancy to be lower,
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Why isn't it? The answer is shocking, even scandalous. According
to the new research, it is because mothers spend more time than
fathers looking after their children.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have tested this theory by examining various kinds
of monkey. They found a strong correlation between the time females
spend caring for their offspring and the longevity of females
relative to males.
</P>
<P>
   Where females do all the caring, their advantage in life
expectancy is greatest; where males share more of the burden, the
female advantage in life span is less.
</P>
<P>
   In about 99 percent of cases, females do more caring than males,
but the clincher is that the researchers also examined two species
_ the owl monkey and the titi monkey _ where males are the main
carers. In both these species, males live longer than females.
</P>
<P>
   The less time males spend looking after their offspring, it
seems, the more time they spend competing with each other for
status, either by fighting each other or pursuing an irrational
dedication to ball games.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, such struggles make greater demands on one's physical
resources than giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it will be argued that it is premature to base moral
guidance on these results. We disagree. Yes, questions will be
raised about the researchers' findings, or about the Darwinian
rationale that appears to validate them, but these and other
details need not detain us.
</P>
<P>
   The point is clear. Women, deplorably, have been monopolizing
the raising of children and encouraging men to put their very lives
in jeopardy by watching lots of football.
</P>
<P>
   Men, turn off that television and cancel that trip to France. Be
a new man and, this time, mean it. Change a diaper, by God, and put
years on your life. &QL;

EDITORIAL: NEXT, A UNIVERSAL FARE CARD
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 12:
</P>
<P>
   James Simpson, one of Gov. George Pataki's appointees on the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, wants to phase out the
Metrocard. That may puzzle New York City subway and bus riders who
have forsaken tokens for electronic fare cards, but Simpson
actually has their best interests at heart. Starting with a
subcommittee meeting Monday, he will press transit managers to roll
out a universal card. The idea makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with a powerful microchip, the card would function as
an electronic wallet for riding the tristate region's transit
systems. It would pay fares on subways and buses, pay tolls at
bridges and tunnels, and let holders make retail purchases and
phone calls. The rapid transit system in Washington D.C. is testing
its version of a universal card. Chicago is considering one as
well.
</P>
<P>
   As this page has noted, a universal card would not only ease
every rider's access to all forms of public transportation, but
would nudge the region a step closer to creating a seamless system
like Paris' integration of the Metro and the regional express
lines. In addition a universal card, also called a smart card,
would not have to be swiped. As a contact-free card, it could be
``read'' by an electronic turnstile, much like the E-Z Pass at
bridges and tunnels. The vexing problem of first- and second-swipe
failures would vanish.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, New York City transit executives are fretting
about a far smaller challenge _ the fall rollout of a daily
discount pass, a $4 Metrocard that would give its user unlimited
rides for 24 hours. Managers fear that a cheap daily pass could
drain revenue, even though daily discount passes are common in
other cities here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   However, under one proposal circulating among transit officials,
day passes would be sold only at hotels and tourist haunts. That
would discriminate against ordinary New Yorkers as well as
suburbanites who choose to spend a day in the city. The Washington
Metro's daily pass sells for $5 and offers unlimited rides after
the morning rush hour. By drawing on the experience of systems here
and abroad, managers should be able to come up with a price and
structure that satisfies Governor Pataki's wish for a pass that
will be attractive to tourists and to those who will not be using
the forthcoming monthly and weekly discount cards.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When viewed from above, the debate now raging in Europe over
genetically modified organisms looks rather like a crop circle.
Those for and against the release of such species are cutting
complex patterns into deep fields of scientific and social opinion.
</P>
<P>
   To the public, the meaning of these patterns is unclear _ except
that dangerous and mysterious forces are plainly at work.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto, an American agricultural and biotechnology company,
has just launched a K1 million ($1.6 million) campaign to convince
Europeans they have nothing to fear, ecologically or
physiologically, from such products as herbicide-resistant soybeans
or vitamin-enhanced oils.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including most recently the Prince of Wales, accuse the
biotechnology industry of being more interested in plundering the
crop than splendor in the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are left confused. Those who oppose genetically
modified foods have not always been honest about their possible
benefits. Those who favor them have not always been honest about
their possible costs.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, Europeans are more skeptical of genetic
engineering than Americans. But they are willing to make
distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic modification of animals for medical research or drug
development is seen as a necessary evil. And so long as such
animals are kept inside the laboratory, public concerns are largely
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically engineered plants are seen as a different matter:
does it make sense to meddle with nature for the sake of a sweeter
beet or a brighter tomato?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike transgenic animals, such plants are designed to live in
the open, where they may crossbreed with wild relatives _ and
products made with them will end up on the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   It is right to be extremely cautious about messing with the food
supply. Even so, much of the public fear about genetics comes from
poor understanding.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is the idea that genetic modification in the
laboratory is more dangerous than genetic modification in the
field, which is long-established. Laboratory modification
introduces alien and unnatural genes into crops, it is argued,
where their eventual effects are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of, say, strawberries engineered to produce the natural
antifreeze that occurs in flounder or beetles add to the sense of
strangeness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most plants that have been genetically modified contain
genes from related plant species or some of their natural microbial
neighbors. And the genes and proteins (especially the ones that
scientists are keenest to swap) of bacteria and plants are very
similar in any case.
</P>
<P>
   Another misunderstanding leads to the fear that antibiotic
resistance could be transferred from plants to bacteria in the
human gut, creating dangerous pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   This risk is no greater for engineered foods than for
conventional ones _ and no such risk has yet been demonstrated in
either instance.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is untrue that planting seeds modified to resist
herbicides will lead to fields being stripped of all other life, as
Prince Charles alleged this week in Britain's Daily Telegraph.
Microorganisms and animal life will be no more affected than
before.
</P>
<P>
   Although these answers may go some way to placating the public,
they fail to address some trickier questions.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if a new gene is introduced into the wrong section
of the plant's own DNA, leading to subtle changes in its chemistry?
What if a new gene moves from a modified plant to an unmodified
bystander? If something goes wrong, how can it be put right?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, nobody knows. There have been isolated reports of
such ``what if'' cases arising in practice, but scientists have
made no systematic assessment of their frequency or significance.
</P>
<P>
   Trials to date have been too short or too small to shed much
light. And like some drug complications, ecological side-effects
may take years to appear. It proves little that there is no
evidence of harm so far.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor of plant modification often argue that the new
techniques are really no different from traditional plant-breeding.
Why all the fuss now?, they ask, puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   They are right _ but they also miss the point, which is the need
to win the public's trust. The fiasco of mad-cow disease (BSE) has
dented the credibility of scientists and politicians when it comes
to food.
</P>
<P>
   Although BSE has nothing to do with genetic modification, that
sorry tale has added to fears that the same commercial pressures
which forced unsafe feed into animals are pushing unproven crops
into people.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech industry is also vulnerable to the charge that it
tried to force-feed the market by flooding Europe with so much
modified soya as to make regulating it impossible. That evoked a
reaction. Now, no one can blithely ignore the opposition to the new
foods.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and industry must accept that the BSE crisis has put
the burden of proof in food safety firmly on to the innovator,
where it belonged in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Greater public disclosure (in the form of labelling) and tighter
regulation (through more systematic testing both before and after
release) are desirable in themselves _ and have become politically
inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   This need not stifle innovation, as some companies may fear.
Strict regulation is hardly a novelty for biotechnology firms. If,
as seems likely, the greatest benefit of genetic modifications is
in their potential as ``functional foods'' or even as therapeutic
drugs, then a new regime will anyway be needed to regulate these
novel properties.
</P>
<P>
   And the task of educating the public is not as hopeless as some
companies appear to think. Consider the results of Switzerland's
recent referendum on genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Although voters were divided on the issue just weeks ago,
Switzerland's scientists opened their laboratories and expressed
their views. The result was a two-thirds majority against a ban on
genetic modification of plants and animals and their release into
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   If other scientists follow the Swiss and open a public
conversation, the public must be willing to listen politely.
</P>
<P>
   It is profoundly unhelpful to storm off in a huff _ destroying
transgenic seeds and pulling up field trials, as has happened in
France, Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The need is for good information: destroying the fields that are
the best means of supplying it is simply perverse.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically modified crops have great potential to improve plant
and human health. If the first product on the market had been a
nutritionally enhanced rice rather than a high-tech tomato,
consumer response might now be very different.
</P>
<P>
   Today's debate offers scientists another chance to engage the
public and assuage their fears. For the future of biotechnology,
these are seeds worth sowing. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When viewed from above, the debate now raging in Europe over
genetically modified organisms looks rather like a crop circle.
Those for and against the release of such species are cutting
complex patterns into deep fields of scientific and social opinion.
</P>
<P>
   To the public, the meaning of these patterns is unclear _ except
that dangerous and mysterious forces are plainly at work.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto, an American agricultural and biotechnology company,
has just launched a K1 million ($1.6 million) campaign to convince
Europeans they have nothing to fear, ecologically or
physiologically, from such products as herbicide-resistant soybeans
or vitamin-enhanced oils.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including most recently the Prince of Wales, accuse the
biotechnology industry of being more interested in plundering the
crop than splendor in the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are left confused. Those who oppose genetically
modified foods have not always been honest about their possible
benefits. Those who favor them have not always been honest about
their possible costs.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, Europeans are more skeptical of genetic
engineering than Americans. But they are willing to make
distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic modification of animals for medical research or drug
development is seen as a necessary evil. And so long as such
animals are kept inside the laboratory, public concerns are largely
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically engineered plants are seen as a different matter:
does it make sense to meddle with nature for the sake of a sweeter
beet or a brighter tomato?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike transgenic animals, such plants are designed to live in
the open, where they may crossbreed with wild relatives _ and
products made with them will end up on the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   It is right to be extremely cautious about messing with the food
supply. Even so, much of the public fear about genetics comes from
poor understanding.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is the idea that genetic modification in the
laboratory is more dangerous than genetic modification in the
field, which is long-established. Laboratory modification
introduces alien and unnatural genes into crops, it is argued,
where their eventual effects are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of, say, strawberries engineered to produce the natural
antifreeze that occurs in flounder or beetles add to the sense of
strangeness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most plants that have been genetically modified contain
genes from related plant species or some of their natural microbial
neighbors. And the genes and proteins (especially the ones that
scientists are keenest to swap) of bacteria and plants are very
similar in any case.
</P>
<P>
   Another misunderstanding leads to the fear that antibiotic
resistance could be transferred from plants to bacteria in the
human gut, creating dangerous pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   This risk is no greater for engineered foods than for
conventional ones _ and no such risk has yet been demonstrated in
either instance.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is untrue that planting seeds modified to resist
herbicides will lead to fields being stripped of all other life, as
Prince Charles alleged this week in Britain's Daily Telegraph.
Microorganisms and animal life will be no more affected than
before.
</P>
<P>
   Although these answers may go some way to placating the public,
they fail to address some trickier questions.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if a new gene is introduced into the wrong section
of the plant's own DNA, leading to subtle changes in its chemistry?
What if a new gene moves from a modified plant to an unmodified
bystander? If something goes wrong, how can it be put right?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, nobody knows. There have been isolated reports of
such ``what if'' cases arising in practice, but scientists have
made no systematic assessment of their frequency or significance.
</P>
<P>
   Trials to date have been too short or too small to shed much
light. And like some drug complications, ecological side-effects
may take years to appear. It proves little that there is no
evidence of harm so far.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor of plant modification often argue that the new
techniques are really no different from traditional plant-breeding.

QUIXOTIC JOHN MCCAIN: TILTING AT WINDMILLS _ AND THE WHITE HOUSE?

<TEXT>
<P>
   At times it is hard to keep up: a flurry of farewells to a
visitor who just happens to be Bill Gates; a quick ride to the
Senate on Capitol Hill's own subway system; a 10-minute confab with
the Senate leader, Trent Lott, in an attempt to save a tobacco bill
that will force the cigarette-makers to discourage their own
customers and pay the government some $516 billion over the next 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, marching past the gawking tourists and the
statues of politicians long since forgotten, the thoughts of
Chairman McCain: ``You do it because it's right...You do the best
you can.'' Does that make John McCain, senior Republican senator
from Arizona and chairman of the Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee, a driven man?
</P>
<P>
   It is a tempting notion. After all, there is no other senator
with quite the same experience of the tricks of fate: shot down
over Vietnam; horribly tortured during more than five years'
captivity in the ``Hanoi Hilton,'' half of them in solitary
confinement; financed in his early political career by a man who
turned out to be a crook.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the deep-brown eyes have a piercing quality to them;
no wonder the energy level is almost frenetic, as though there is
too much to do and not enough time to do it in.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain himself says: ``I learned a long time ago that things
are transient around here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tone is of fatalistic humor, not anguished exasperation.
Perhaps the senator is driven, but surely not in a partisan or
self-promoting way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you take McCain at his word _ ``You do it because it's
right'' _ and you believe him. Why else would he have sponsored
last year's abortive attempt to reform a system of campaign finance
that so obviously benefits his party more than the Democrats?
</P>
<P>
   Why else would he be pushing for a tobacco bill that will
penalize some of his party's biggest corporate donors _ and, if the
tobacco industry's advertisements work, alienate a working class of
chain-smoking Americans by forcing them to cough up another $1.10 a
pack in taxes over the next five years (they already pay around
$2.85 a pack to enjoy what is still, just, a legal vice).
</P>
<P>
   There is a quixotic quality to the war-hero's legislative jousts
that can leave his party colleagues seething: they know they can
foil his ambitions but they fear being publicly embarrassed in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   All of which endears McCain both to the Democrats and to the
media. The Democrats would warm to any opponent who dares to ruffle
the smooth Lott (last weekend the Senate leader had prematurely
declared the tobacco bill ``dead'').
</P>
<P>
   The media love the idea, indeed the reality, of a politician of
principle and independence, especially one who cracks
self-deprecating jokes and will defy any number of time zones to
appear on the TV talk shows. As Esquire magazine headlined an
article last month, ``John McCain Walks on Water.''
</P>
<P>
   So will he walk, as some predict and many hope, out of the
Senate and into the White House in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   McCain himself skirts the issue; after all, he still has to be
elected (easily, one would think) to a third Senate term in this
November's election.
</P>
<P>
   But the pundits are happy to speculate on the senator's behalf.
He looks good on television (better, in fact, than in real life,
where he looks every one of his 60 years and where his arms _
broken in his Vietnam crash and distorted by his captors _ are
bowed in stiff curves).
</P>
<P>
   His personal skeletons are no longer hidden: rampant infidelity
to the disabled first wife who waited for his return from war, and
his membership of the ``Keating Five,'' senators who interceded
with regulators on behalf of Charles Keating, the savings-and-loan
fraudster who had helped finance McCain's political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   For some politicians, such failings would be electorally fatal;
but part of McCain's charm is that he readily admits his mistakes.
Even though the senator was exonerated in the Keating case, he
nonetheless still feels he betrayed his sense of honor.
</P>
<P>
   He has, too, the electorally useful knack of reducing the
complex issue to the comprehensible sound bite. The tobacco bill,
for example, is needed because ``3,000 kids will start smoking
every day, and 1,000 of them will die from smoking-related
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for all the tilting at windmills, he has a certain mastery
of the political process: campaign-finance reform, for example, was
sustained as an issue long beyond the patience of Lott and the
House Speaker, Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The same will be true, one suspects, of the tobacco bill (this
week's kiss-of-life involves buying off Republican opponents by
lessening the tax-penalty on some married couples and by giving
extra money to anti-drugs programs, including a provision allowing
student victims of drug-related violence to transfer to private
schools).
</P>
<P>
   But there is one obvious pitfall on McCain's path to 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue. The senator may be a good conservative in the
Republican tradition, but he pays scant attention to Republican
disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, for example, he was the sole Republican senator
to vote against the Telecommunications Act, on the ground that it
did not go far enough in the cause of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he compounds his maverick reputation with his present
Democrat-friendly desires to mop up excessive money and to penalize
a whole industry.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, why on earth should the Republicans want to
nominate him when they have the loyal George W. Bush, governor of
Texas, as an attractive alternative, let alone a queue of other
hopefuls from Steve Forbes to Dan Quayle?
</P>
<P>
   How will McCain amass the war chest to force his candidacy upon
them? And besides, what exactly would the senator's message be?
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly, none of this seems to worry the senator. As one
Republican insider says, ``Being a POW seems to give a guy a
different focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as McCain, musing on the tobacco bill, says, ``One of these
days I'll be in the old soldiers' home with my feet up, and I'll
ask myself: `Did I try my best?' If it fails, it fails...Someone
else will try.'' &QL;

<P>
   In other words, why on earth should the Republicans want to
nominate him when they have the loyal George W. Bush, governor of
Texas, as an attractive alternative, let alone a queue of other
hopefuls from Steve Forbes to Dan Quayle?
</P>
<P>
   How will McCain amass the war chest to force his candidacy upon
them? And besides, what exactly would the senator's message be?
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly, none of this seems to worry the senator. As one
Republican insider says, ``Being a POW seems to give a guy a
different focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as McCain, musing on the tobacco bill, says, ``One of these
days I'll be in the old soldiers' home with my feet up, and I'll
ask myself: `Did I try my best?' If it fails, it fails...Someone
else will try.'' &QL;

ONE DEAD, FIVE INJURED IN MOUNTAIN AVALANCHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE AND KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGMIRE _ An avalanche rumbled down the eastern side of Mount
Rainier Thursday, striking 12 climbers along the most popular route
to the 14,410-foot summit.
</P>
<P>
   One man was killed, left dangling from a rope until rescuers
were able to reach his body as night fell.
</P>
<P>
   He is believed to have died before sunset, suffering severe
internal injuries, said Maria Gillett, a National Park spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Another man broke a leg, one woman and one man each suffered a
broken hand and another woman suffered from hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 survivors were either rescued or escaped on their own.
But rescuers had to call off their efforts because of darkness as
they tried to reach the man hanging by a rope at about 11,300 feet.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening rangers had gotten close enough to remove the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 8 p.m. Eric Walkinshaw, a spokesman at Mount Rainier
National Park, said the man had been ``moving and conscious,'' but
died sometime later, on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The man was at the end of a rope that had included five other
people, said John Krambrink, the park's chief ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers saved the other five, who were probably going to spend
the night on the mountain with rescuers, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries were not considered serious enough for the five to
be sent out by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Of most concern was the woman suffering from severe hypothermia,
which can be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   A rescue team was digging in for the night out of the line of
avalanches, Krambrink said.
</P>
<P>
   Six climbers escaped uninjured. They stopped their slide by
sticking ice axes in the snow, Walkinshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche, which an ice fall may have set off, occurred in
the afternoon as two groups of climbers were coming down from the
mountain summit, Walkinshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The slide was most likely a slow-moving, ``point release''
avalanche that loped along at a jog-like pace, said Phil Ohl, an
experienced hiker who has also ascended Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   It was slow-moving but powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The avalanche swept six of them off Disappointment Cleaver,''
Walkinshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The man hanging by a rope was at the cleaver, a giant rock
outcropping that separates the Emmons and Ingraham glaciers.
</P>
<P>
   Each group _ made up of six climbers _ was roped together.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of disabled climber Peter Rieke, who is ascending the
mountain by a vehicle he operates with his arms, saw a team of
climbers falling over the cleaver, Krambrink said.
</P>
<P>
   She notified park officials by cellular telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Park rangers, several professional climbing guides and other
mountain rescue crews _ perhaps at least 20 people _ were involved
in rescue attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chinook and Blackhawk helicopters were being used. But
Walkinshaw said a low cloud cover was keeping some helicopters
away.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche occurred on the Camp Muir-Disappointment Cleaver
route, the shortest and most popular of the routes up the mountain.
At least 10,000 people try to climb the mountain every year; about
half succeed, Walkinshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of climbers were on the mountain Thursday. Most try to
reach the summit early in the morning and return to Camp Muir by
noon.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems likely that the climbers caught in the avalanche had
reached the summit and were coming down, behind schedule,
Walkinshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche site is near that of the worst climbing accident
ever at Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people died on June 11, 1981, when they were caught in a
huge icefall at the 11,000-foot level on the Ingraham Glacier
between Disappointment Cleaver and Gilbraltar Rock.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 93 climbing deaths on the mountain since 1882.
</P>
<P>
   An accident such as Thursday's is somewhat unusual for this time
of year, when attempts to climb the mountain are usually launched
and the avalanche danger is considered low.
</P>
<P>
   ``By June, the snow is relatively stable,'' said Dan Phillips,
an owner and guide for Cascade Alpine Guides, a Bellevue
mountaineering company who had 12 people reach the summit
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts say recent warm temperatures on the mountain
increased the chances for an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Melting snow makes for favorable avalanche conditions because it
changes the stability of the snowpack.
</P>
<P>
   With weekend temperatures in the low 70s _ and more warm weather
Thursday _ parts of Rainier's snowpack had softened significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Warm weather on the mountain _ the summit was bathed in sunlight
and the freezing level was at least 11,000 feet Thursday afternoon
_ made the snow sloppy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real concern normally isn't avalanches. It's the soft snow
bridges over crevasses,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts for the mountain called for temperatures approaching
40 degrees at Camp Muir, which is at the 10,000-foot level.

   NEW LONDON, CONN. _ Along the coast of Connecticut lies a group
of port cities, all of which have been battered by the loss of jobs
in the defense industry.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven (in spite of the presence of Yale University) and
Bridgeport (surrounded by one of the richest communities in
America) are both down-at-heel.
</P>
<P>
   Further north is New London, once the heart of the world's
nuclear submarine industry and now a windswept clutter of vacant
sites and boarded-up buildings along the appropriately named Thames
River.
</P>
<P>
   But New London has been luckier than its Connecticut neighbors:
and its luck may carry a lesson for the way universities can
influence urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   In New London, the most renowned university is not (as Yale is)
right in the desolate center of town. Instead, Connecticut College
perches on a hill high above the river, its granite campus cut off
by a highway from the rest of the town.
</P>
<P>
   For years, it has been resented: ``We thought of the college as
those monied folks on the hill who don't pay property tax,'' says
one New London businessman.
</P>
<P>
   As in many American towns, when industry went, it left behind
the bodies that pay little or no local tax _ hospitals, schools,
universities _ and a lot of people on lower wages, or on none at
all.
</P>
<P>
   New London was a victim of the peace dividend of the early
1990s. A decade ago, its corner of America was more dependent on
defense jobs than almost any other.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s the largest employer in the region, a submarine
builder called Electric Boat, owned by General Dynamics, which had
once employed 23,000 people, began to cut its labor force to 7,500.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500 professional jobs in a naval underwater research
center also went last year. In a labor market which today has
around 150,000 jobs, these were heavy blows.
</P>
<P>
   The job losses have been largely offset by the opening, a few
miles away, of two vast casinos on Indian land. Between them, these
now directly employ about 17,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The more lasting damage has come from the loss of buoyancy in
property tax. Connecticut is a state of 169 urban fiefs, each keen
to tax and spend; and New London is a high-tax city.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because it has few taxpayers and many demands:
``With 33 houses of worship, two colleges and a hospital, almost
half our six square miles is not taxable,'' says Richard Brown, the
city manager.
</P>
<P>
   But the town also has higher poverty and lower incomes than its
neighbors. Unusually for this largely white corner of Connecticut,
a third of its people are black.
</P>
<P>
   For some time now, the Republican state government has been
trying to breathe life into New London. So, not always
harmoniously, have the town's governing Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, at the state's initiative, Claire Gaudiani, the
glamorous and energetic 53-year-old president of Connecticut
College, was recruited to revive the town's moribund development
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from bringing together New London's businesses to think
about their town's future, she offered something else the
politicians could not match: connections.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river, in Groton, is the main American research base
of Pfizer, a large pharmaceutical company. Ms. Gaudiani dropped in
on its boss, George Milne, and persuaded him to take charge of
corporate development for the new body.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks, she recalls, ``He changed from a director to
a client'': he put to his board the idea of expanding on the town's
largest empty site, a stretch of riverbank where an old linoleum
mill once stood.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Pfizer announced that it would go ahead, eventually
bringing 2,000 top-notch jobs to the city center.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on the town has been dramatic. Some officials resent
this coup de theatre by an academic (French literature) and a woman
at that, but they admit that the housing market has perked up and
that other companies are suddenly showing an interest in moving in.
</P>
<P>
   In time, they expect the new Pfizer plant to bring in 12-15
percent of the town's property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Pfizer fall for Ms. Gaudiani's charm? In fact, says
Milne, Pfizer's first plant was in Brooklyn, and the company sees
being a socially concerned employer as part of a culture that will
attract bright young scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The new center will look exciting, with a ferry to skim across
to the Groton office for lunch. ``I believe very much that the
nature of a company's buildings can be a competitive advantage,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   But there were drawbacks, too, of the kind that matter to
upmarket companies: a site that might turn out to be contaminated,
bringing an expensive liability to clean up; a lack of employment
opportunities for the spouses of employees; and no decent airport.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as happens increasingly in such situations, the state
and city between them have removed or underwritten most worries
about liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   They have also removed most of the property-tax burden that
would fall on the company in the first decade. As a result, the new
site may not cost Pfizer any more, at least at first, than a
greenfield site would have done.
</P>
<P>
   As for transport, the train links with New York and Boston are
being electrified, and next year that will make New London about 1
hours from each city.
</P>
<P>
   Having pulled off her coup, Ms. Gaudiani is now keen to pull off
more _ one a quarter, she hopes. She is working her contacts,
artistic and corporate, and dreams of turning New London into ``a
hip little town.''
</P>
<P>
   She took on the task partly, she says, because she felt the
college owed something to the town: in the early years of the
century, when colleges for women were still rare, the citizens of
New London collected money and donated the land for Connecticut
College, which is now co-ed.
</P>
<P>
   The town's press and businesses did not initially return the
compliment. The Pfizer deal has changed all that. Now, says Ms.
Gaudiani, she is startled to see the effect of the college's
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had wildly underestimated the impact that a college
president had to convene and request and engage and inspire,'' she
says effusively. ``All over our country, we in higher education
could do a lot more if we used the moral juice that comes in our
food basket and let others have a sip.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson that other college presidents might take on
board. Just along the coast, the larger town of New Haven is
wrestling with some of the same difficulties as New London. But
Yale, which is starting to feel the impact, has been slow to use
its academic prestige on the city's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd encourage the president of Yale to say to his board, `I'm
going to spend a third of my time on New Haven' _ it's that
important,'' says Ms. Gaudiani. &QL;

   ``Two bald men fighting over a comb'' was how one observer
described the sudden eruption of war between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   They are, per head of population, the two poorest countries in
the world, bar Mozambique. Yet they are fighting for a few square
miles of barren mountain where a few thousand souls barely scratch
a living. The whole border is now a battle zone, and the two
countries are on war footing.
</P>
<P>
   Minor tank and artillery battles broke out in early May. The
ostensible reason was that each government accused the other of
incursions across the poorly marked common border.
</P>
<P>
   A joint American and Rwandan peacemaking team shuttled between
the capitals, coming up with a four-point plan: both sides should
withdraw their troops from the border, which would then be observed
by international monitors, civilian authority would be restored to
the disputed areas, and an investigation held into the root causes
of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, announced
that he had accepted the plan. But, at the same time, he said that
his defense forces had been instructed ``to take all steps needed
to foil the Eritrean invasion,'' and that the Eritreans must
withdraw from areas they had occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea also agreed to the plan but said it would withdraw its
troops only if the border area were demilitarized.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Eritrean aircraft were reported to have bombed the
airport at Mekele, a small town in northern Ethiopia. Eritrea,
however, denies that it was the first to attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the early afternoon, four Ethiopian MiGs bombed the airport
at Asmara, Eritrea's capital. Mekele was bombed again in the
evening but on this occasion the bombs fell on residential areas
including a primary school, killing 47 people, according to the
Ethiopians. The peace plan was blown to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Meles and Issaias Afwerki, Eritrea's president, appear to be as
surprised as everybody else to find they are at war. Neither are
military buffoons in search of glory or empires.
</P>
<P>
   They hold similar views, face similar problems, have common
allies and the same enemies. They were once brothers-in-arms in the
struggle against the Soviet-backed dictatorship of Mengistu Haile
Mariam.
</P>
<P>
   So why are they fighting?
</P>
<P>
   A popular theory is that geography is reasserting itself. The
Eritreans supported the Ethiopian rebels in the fight against the
Mengistu regime on condition that, when they came to power, Eritrea
would be allowed to secede. This happened, but Eritrea's secession
left Ethiopia landlocked, dependent on Eritrean goodwill for its
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Various irritations may have stirred Ethiopia's fear of being
cut off from the sea, and Eritrea's fear that its new independence
might be infringed by a resentful Ethiopia. The border, according
to this theory, was just a pretext for fighting over more serious
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But, even in private, neither side admits to any serious
disagreement beyond the border dispute. The Ethiopians cite the
agreements the two countries have signed on free trade,
environmental protection and even military cooperation as evidence
of how well they had been getting on.
</P>
<P>
   Their explanation for the conflict puts the blame on Afwerki:
since he has failed to make life better for most of his people, he
needs a war to distract and unify them.
</P>
<P>
   The Eritreans say that the problems had been festering for a
long time. They claim to have offered Ethiopia cooperation, even
integration, leading to the ending of all barriers between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Eritrea, militiamen from the border province
of Tigray persistently encroached on Eritrean territory, ignoring
polite requests to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the Eritreans recently found a new map issued in
Tigray which showed parts of Eritrea as Ethiopia. So they decided
to hold on to disputed ground, and this led to further clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea, in its five years of independence, has been quick to
pick fights: it has had shooting wars with both Yemen and Djibouti
and vows to overthrow the Sudan government.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it had 100,000 men under arms (with only 4
million people) and demobilization has been slow, with little
employment at the end. Yet an ill-marked border is seldom a cause
for war between friends _ and it is still uncertain who fired
first. &QL;

HICKS FEARLESS IN WIELDING A BUCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Read their lips. It's not about the money.
</P>
<P>
   Money can't always buy a pennant. Money can't buy happiness.
Money can't even buy guaranteed, consistent starting pitching _ eh,
Angels?
</P>
<P>
   But all leading economic indicators suggest in baseball, it
doesn't hurt to have lots of it. Lots of money. Which is why,
though it won't make the boxscores, the Rangers made the first
major acquisition in their drive for the American League pennant
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hick$ is the real deal. A mover, a shaker and an empire
maker.
</P>
<P>
   His potential was immediately noticed Thursday at the press
conference introducing him. Judging from The Ballpark at
Arlington's parking garage, for the first time in recent memory,
the owner has a flashier car than most of the players.
</P>
<P>
   Was it not poignant that almost by harmonic covergence, the
Anaheim Angels hit town for their four-game showdown series on the
same day Hick$ was officially trumpeted as the Rangers' new owner?
</P>
<P>
   Poignant, because your humble correspondent was one of the ones
who voiced gloom and doom when the Angels changed hands two years
ago. Under Gene Autry, the Angels could be counted upon to ride off
into the sunset nearly every summer.
</P>
<P>
   But two years ago last month, they went Goofy. Visions of a
Disney baseball empire like Ted Turner's began to stew in AL West
rivals' heads.
</P>
<P>
   Instead _ yawn _ it's been like one of those ``Mighty Ducks''
sequels. What sort of Mickey Mouse operation comes in and doesn't
add a starting pitcher, but a ``Lion King'' starter kit beyond the
fence in left field?
</P>
<P>
   Hick$, on the other hand, has a proven track record. Under his
ownership, the Stars have risen to the upper echelon of the NHL. He
will own the Rangers, he said Thursday, in the same style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be very similar,'' Hick$ said. ``Both
organizations are really well-run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that the Stars were not a healthy franchise
when I bought the team. We had to make some immediate changes to
restore the fans' turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal there is to win the Stanley Cup and to be competitive
every year. And that's also my goal with the Texas Rangers _ to win
the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Read his lips, though. It's not about the money.
</P>
<P>
   Take the ``other'' Rangers, Hick$ said _ the NHL's New York
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a history of pro sports owners who have spent money
without ending up with winning teams,'' he said. ``The New York
Rangers had the highest payroll in hockey and didn't win this
season. That's management and that's organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Read their lips, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that the focus should be on spending money or
not,'' said Tom Schieffer, who remains as club president.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer was almost wincing as he fielded the line of
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   He can't be that naive, though. Local fans see Hick$ in only one
way _ a wealthy man with no fear of doing whatever it takes to
build a winner.
</P>
<P>
   A starting pitcher. Another bullpen arm. Rangers fans have been
compiling Hick$' grocery list for two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a spigot, you know, that you just turn on and a
pennant comes out,'' Schieffer said. ``We're in first place. And
one of the reasons we're in first place is because we already have
a payroll that's one of the highest in baseball and that those
players are producing.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   So when can fans expect the new pitcher?
</P>
<P>
   Hick$ himself pointed to the market advantages of being in the
Fort Worth-Dallas area and of already having The Ballpark at his
command.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be a Top 5, 6, 8 or 9 team in payroll in both
sports,'' he said. ``And we can win a championship with that
level.''
</P>
<P>
   You wonder, then, who will be the Rangers' versions of Ed
Belfour, their Brian Skrudland and Mike Keane _ the final pieces of
the pennant puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson? Schieffer can't fathom the Seattle Mariners
trading Johnson to another AL West foe.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Erickson? Bob Tewksbury? Mike Morgan? Curt Schilling?
</P>
<P>
   The answers may be no to all of them. But as of this week, the
reason probably won't be money.
</P>
<P>
   In today's baseball climate, early summer has become the time to
dump salaries and to look to the future. Jerry Reinsdorf was
criticized for flushing the White Sox too early last season, but
the move clearly signaled a trend.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Orioles _ Half-Price Off?
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers need no longer avoid those phone calls. The new
owner isn't Goofy. He just wants to win.
</P>
<P>
   Let the spigotting begin.

RANGERS' NEW OWNER-ELECT NOT TIPPING HIS HAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Tom Hicks conducted his first news conference
Thursday as owner-elect of the Texas Rangers. He did not bring Todd
Zeile or Randy Johnson to The Ballpark in Arlington with him.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers began a new era when Major League Baseball owners
unanimously approved Hicks' $250 million purchase of the franchise
on Wednesday. However, the early indications are that the new era
will look a lot like the old one, at least for the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no trades that were waiting to happen because of
this transaction,'' said Tom Schieffer, who remains as club
president.
</P>
<P>
   That means Zeile, the Florida Marlins third baseman, won't be
coming to town. That was reported by one national publication,
which said the deal would be done as soon as Hicks became owner so
he could approve the bump in payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will Johnson, the disgruntled ace who wants out of
Seattle, be headed here anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, who also owns the Stars, expects to close on the purchase
of the franchise from the group headed by Edward ``Rusty'' Rose on
Tuesday. That's when he officially can begin to make moves.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't, though, envision major changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not,'' he said. ``We're in first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said he will explore selling the naming rights to the
ballpark. He said he will begin bringing in minority owners,
continue to work on a sports holding company and a TV network for
the Rangers and Stars, and begin developing the land around the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said there will be no immediate bump in payroll, and
no immediate mandate to Schieffer, general manager Doug Melvin and
manager Johnny Oates to do whatever it takes to upgrade the
starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a fan, I've got my own ideas,'' Hicks said. ``But I respect
the organization, so I want to listen to Johnny and Doug and Tom
and get their recommendations. My suspicion is some of their
concerns would be the same as some of the concerns I have. But you
can't just press a button and fix those. The good players you might
want aren't necessarily available. At this point it really is
fine-tuning.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks did make sweeping changes when he purchased the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference was with the Stars is they were not a healthy
franchise when I bought the team,'' Hicks said. ``We had to make
some immediate changes to restore the fans' trust. We made some
major changes the first year, we had some fine-tuning the second
year, and we may do some fine tuning this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers already are at the ``fine-tuning'' stage. They play
in a state-of-the-art facility before almost 36,000 spectators a
night, and their payroll already is among the top seven in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the fine-tuning includes a move that can
help the first-place Rangers win a championship, Hicks indicated he
won't say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in first place, and we want to stay there,'' Schieffer
said. ``I think he's prepared to do whatever it takes to make that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he didn't promise to deliver Johnson before the ink
dries on the sales contract, Hicks said the kind of things that are
sure to please Rangers fans still waiting for that first
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take this team to the next level,'' he said.
``That's my commitment to the fans. There are 30 baseball teams,
and only one gets to win the world championship every year. But it
will be our expectation that this franchise should be a team that
each year over the next 10 years will be one of those teams that
plays for a chance to go to the World Series. Over the next 10
years I expect we will have at least one, or more than one, World
Series championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks won't do it the way the Marlins did. Owner H. Wayne
Huizenga spent liberally in the free-agent market before the '97
season, and won the World Series. The club lost money, though, and
began to auction off the best players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very competitive, and I want to win,'' Hicks said. ``But
I'm a businessman. I'm not foolish. I'm not going to win at all
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team in Dallas/Fort Worth realistically shouldn't have the
highest payroll in baseball. It doesn't work from a business
standpoint. There are teams in larger markets that have cable
revenues and other revenues we just don't have. We intend to follow
in the trend that's been set the last few years. We should be a top
five, six, seven, eight, nine payroll, and we can win championships
at that level.''

ERSTAD DELIVERS  
 YOUNG ANGEL RIPS D-BACKS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever havoc Mark McGwire is planning to wreak when the St.
Louis Cardinals begin a three-game visit to Bank One Ballpark
starting tonight, it probably won't measure up to what Darin Erstad
did to the Diamondbacks the past three days.
</P>
<P>
   For humanity's sake, let us pray it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad and the Anaheim Angels manhandled pitcher Bob Wolcott,
coming off a brilliant outing in his debut, early and often
Thursday night. The Angels scored five runs in the first inning,
rested, then resumed their assault in the fourth to drive Wolcott
from the game en route to a 10-5 victory at Bank One Ballpark in
front of 41,954.
</P>
<P>
   Acting peeved that the Diamondbacks ended their nine-game
winning streak on Wednesday, the Angels hit a season-high five home
runs, two by Dave Hollins.
</P>
<P>
   If he hadn't already, Erstad this series officially was
registered as a deadly weapon. At 24, he has ventured past the
brink of stardom. He is there. The Diamondbacks tried everything
against the Arizona Fall League alumnus except kryptonite.
</P>
<P>
   Currently playing left field but better as a first baseman,
Erstad had four hits, including a triple and a home run, and drove
in two runs to conclude a remarkable series.
</P>
<P>
   He almost went 5 for 5 for the second time in three games but
lined out to first baseman Travis Lee in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   In the three games against the Diamondbacks, Erstad was 10 for
14 with a double, triple, two homers, four RBI and and six runs
scored. Going back even farther, he is 15 for his past 23. He is
now batting .333 with 15 home runs and 44 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad began the assault on Wolcott by sharply rapping a single.
Then the next hitter, Hollins, who experienced a somewhat scary
diabetic reaction on Tuesday, took a sweet swing and lined a home
run to right field. Two batters, and a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Next was Jim Edmonds, who singled. That brought up Cecil
Fielder, and Wolcott knew better. He walked Fielder. Garret
Anderson fouled out, and it looked as if Wolcott had settled down.
But Matt Walbeck settled into a Wolcott pitch, sending it over the
fence in right for a three-run homer, and the Angels led, 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Anaheim outs were well-struck. Norberto Martin lined
out to right for the second out before Wolcott got Gary DiScarcina
to ground out to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like more of the same in the second inning when the
invulnerable Erstad tripled with one out and Hollins walked.
Edmonds, who sat out Wednesday's game because of a sore shoulder
after being hit by a Clint Sodowsky pitch the night before, hit a
bullet to first baseman Travis Lee. The rookie not only gloved the
shot but started a nifty double play that ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Wolcott held the Angels off in the third inning, but did a silly
thing in the fourth. With two out, he walked pitcher Jason Dickson.
Not only don't you walk the pitcher, not only don't you walk the
pitcher with two outs, you don't walk the pitcher with two outs and
Erstad coming up. Erstad promptly zipped a home run into the
Angels' now-familiar spot in the right field seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels led, 7-0, and Wolcott, who pitched eight shutout
innings against Oakland last week after being called up from
Tucson, was gone. Felix Rodriguez came in and gave up a two-run
homer to Anderson in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 9-0, the Diamondbacks got a solo home run from Karim
Garcia in the fifth and a three-run blast from Jay Bell in the
sixth, his second homer in two games and 10th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Andy Fox was hit by a pitch with two out, and
scored on Devon White's double to make the score 9-5. But Greg
Cadaret came in for Dickson and got Travis Lee to fly out to avoid
further damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks loaded the bases with two out in the eighth and
Yamil Benitez pinch-hit, representing the tying run. Bullpen ace
Troy Percival came in for Shigetoshi Hasegawa. Benitez hit his
first career grand slam on Tuesday, and hoped to do it again, or at
least keep the inning going. But he struck out. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is no secret that fathers _ even ``new age''
fathers _ tend to spend less time than mothers caring for their
children. It is equally well known that men tend to have shorter
lives than women.
</P>
<P>
   In America, for instance, the average male life span is 73
years, whereas women on average live to be 79.
</P>
<P>
   That the two facts might be connected, however, is surprising.
But research just published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences by John Allman of the California Institute of
Technology and his colleagues suggests that they are.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in longevity between the sexes, at least in
primates, seem to depend on which parent looks after the kids and
how much effort she (or he) puts into it.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that the relationship between child-care and
longevity, if any, would work against the chief carers. Bringing up
children is a grind. But evolution does not work like that.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been established that animals which have evolved to
produce lots of offspring tend to do their breeding early.
Producing offspring uses up resources that might otherwise be
devoted to self-preservation _ so, as you would expect, animals
that have many offspring tend to have short lives.
</P>
<P>
   Animals which have evolved to produce fewer children live longer
_ and are able to invest more in caring for those children that
they do have.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests a link between caring and life span, an idea that
might be extended to differences between the sexes. If so, it
predicts that the care-giving sex (the females, in people and most
other mammals) would live longer than the non-care-giving one.
</P>
<P>
   To see if this was true, Dr. Allman and his colleagues gathered
data on the life spans of ten primates, including man. In all of
these species, the mothers usually have their babies one at a time,
and those offspring are dependent on at least one of their parents
for several years after birth.
</P>
<P>
   Who does what with baby, though, varies a lot from species to
species, depending to a large extent on how sure a male is that the
baby in question is really his.
</P>
<P>
   Male chimpanzees take no interest in any infants who might be
around. Female chimps are extremely promiscuous and males,
therefore, have little idea who their children are.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allman's group found that female chimpanzees live, on
average, about 40 percent longer than males.
</P>
<P>
   Male gorillas, like men, form stronger bonds with particular
females, and thus have more confidence that those females' children
are also their own. Males of both species frequently play with
their infants and protect them from threats, but they still have a
lesser role than females in rearing their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Female gorillas live 12.5 percent longer than males, and women
about 8 percent longer than men.
</P>
<P>
   The acid test, however, was to gather data from species where
the main burden of parental care falls on the male. There are such
animals, in fact, but not many (only about 1 percent of mammals
show any male parental care at all).
</P>
<P>
   However, the researchers managed to find two monkeys where the
father is very new age _ the titi monkey and the owl monkey. Not
surprisingly, the bonds between males and females are unusually
strong in these species, so the male's confidence in his fatherhood
is high.
</P>
<P>
   In both titi and owl monkeys, the father assumes the critical
duty of carrying his children around until they are able to move
safely and independently through the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Infant titi and owl monkeys spend much of their time clinging
tenaciously to their fathers' fur. They are transferred to their
mothers only during brief nursing periods. If the father dies, the
mother will refuse to carry the infant, leaving it to die too.
</P>
<P>
   Gratifyingly for Dr. Allman's theory, in both owl monkeys and
titi monkeys, males live about 20 percent longer than females.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the argument _ that the non-care-giving sex is
trading a shorter life for some evolutionary advantage earlier on _
also makes some sense, at least for males. The more ``available''
that females are, due to lack of a permanent pair bond, the more
they are worth competing for.
</P>
<P>
   Such competition, whether it involves direct conflict between
males, or showing off to females, is not cost-free. But if it
results in extra offspring (or, at least, if not competing
guarantees no offspring), then it is worth it, evolutionarily
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, suggests that female titi and owl monkeys must be
involved in a life-shortening trade-off of their own. Just what
this is remains unknown. But it is at least heartening to discover
that natural selection, despite its pitiless motivations, has found
a way to reward nurturing parents. &QL;

COYOTES SHIP JANNEY TO TAMPA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Craig Janney, the first-line center and No. 4 scorer for the
Coyotes last season, predicted he wouldn't play in Phoenix next
season. On Thursday, he was proven correct.
</P>
<P>
   In what some characterize as a money-saving and roster-clearing
move, Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith traded Janney to Tampa
Bay for journeyman left wing/enforcer Louie DeBrusk and the
Lightning's first pick of the fifth round in the amateur entry
draft this month.
</P>
<P>
   Janney, who didn't return phone calls, produced 10 goals and 43
assists in 68 games. He is entering the final year of his contract
and is scheduled to earn $1.7 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay General Manager Phil Esposito insinuated that budget
concerns by the Coyotes were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Coyotes) have a budget thing going on over there,''
Esposito told the Tampa media. ``With (Sandy) McCarthy, (Enrico)
Circcone and (Andrei) Nazarov, we have plenty of toughness on our
team. What we wanted was somebody to get the puck to our wings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are negotiating what could be a costly contract
extension with Captain Keith Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   With their expected decision not to bring back veteran Mike
Gartner, who either will retire or become a free agent July 1, the
Coyotes will save $1.5 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   The additional savings made by eliminating Janney's salary can
be targeted to retain Tkachuk, possibly without having to also part
company with assistant captain Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't characterize it as that (a cost-saving move),
although it is a significant payroll deduction,'' Smith said.
``It's a trade that clarifies our situation in the middle and
clearly sets up Jeremy Roenick and Cliff Ronning as our top two
centers. It also gives Daniel Briere a chance to push for a roster
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how long we can keep Briere in the (American
Hockey League). I think he's a player and he's going to be an
excellent NHL player in time, but he'll have to earn a spot in
training camp. I expect Craig Janney to have a very good season in
Tampa.''
</P>
<P>
   Briere, who scored one goal in five games in Phoenix, led
Springfield scoring with 36 goals, 56 assists and 92 points in 68
games, fourth in the AHL.
</P>
<P>
   League sources sources said the Coyotes have been trying to
trade Janney for two weeks and were considering making him
available on the waiver wire or in this month's expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Tkachuk and Janney are close, and the captain has
made no secret that he prefers Janney to center him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the trade will sour Tkachuk on completing a
contract extension, Smith answered strongly, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said earlier that the team faces three options with
Tkachuk: It can re-sign him to an extension, he can sit out next
season without pay or the team can trade him, and he added that all
three are viable.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are rampant in the NHL that Tkachuk's contract demands
could mean the Coyotes can't afford to keep both him and Roenick,
but the trade of Janney and Smith's declaration of Roenick as his
top-line center contradicts them.
</P>
<P>
   Center is a position where the Coyotes have an abundance of
players, with Roenick, Ronning, recently re-signed Mike Stapleton,
Bob Corkum, Juha Ylonen, Mark Janssens and Briere.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum and Janssens are restricted Group II free agents.
</P>
<P>
   In DeBrusk, the Coyotes obtained an enforcer who might end up in
Springfield. Enforcer is another position where they seem to have
players in abundance, with Jim McKenzie, Jim Cummins, Janssens and
Sean Gagnon. Like Janssens, McKenzie and Gagnon are restricted free
agents who might receive offers the team won't match. &QL;

ALICEA STATUS QUESTIONABLE FOR SERIES OPENER WITH ANGELS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Reserve infielder Luis Alicea of the Texas
Rangers remains questionable for Friday's game against the Anaheim
Angels at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea, who became the Rangers' second baseman after Mark
McLemore (muscle pull, left hamstring) went on the 15-day disabled
list Sunday, aggravated the area surrounding his left rib cage
during Wednesday's 9-8 loss to the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field.
Alicea departed after the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he did it the other day at home diving for the
pop-up that he didn't catch, and he jammed his elbow into his rib
cage,'' Rangers trainer Danny Wheat said in reference to a
seventh-inning pop-up off the bat of San Diego Padres second
baseman Quilvio Veras during Sunday's 17-8 loss at The Ballpark.
``It hadn't bothered him hitting left-handed, but he felt it
hitting right-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels plan to start right-hander Omar Olivares tonight,
which improves Alicea's chances of playing after receiving
treatment Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother him hitting left-handed,'' Wheat said. ``He
may be fine hitting right-handed by'' tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would be without three of the four middle infielders
on their Opening Day roster should Alicea not be able to play.
Shortstop Kevin Elster (ligament strain, left shoulder) went on the
disabled list June 5, retroactive to June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve infielders Domingo Cedeno and Scott Sheldon, whom the
Rangers purchased June 5 from Triple-A Oklahoma to replaced Elster,
will likely start at second base and shortstop should Alicea not be
able to play.
`A GREAT SERIES' Right fielder Juan Gonzalez made a prediction
regarding this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a great series,'' Gonzalez said of the Rangers'
four-game set with the Angels. ``It's a battle for the American
League West, and we need a split or go 3-1.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered Thursday with a three-game lead over the
Angels, whose nine-game winning streak ended Wednesday at the hands
of the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been playing well,'' first baseman Will Clark said.
``We've been playing well, and now we get a chance to play one
another.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won eight of the 12 games played between the two
during 1997, but this will be their first meeting this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we're the two best teams in the division, so it's
definitely going to be an important series for us,'' designated
hitter Lee Stevens said. ``It's great to play a series that means
something. Guys always talk about taking it to another level, and
you have to do that against teams like New York, Anaheim, Boston
and Cleveland.''
.300 DOESN'T TOP STEVENS' GOALS Stevens, who during 1997 hit .300,
does not view that among his primary objectives this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a goal at all for me,'' said Stevens, who enters
tonight's game hitting .257 with 12 home runs and 34 runs batted
in. ``It became a goal last year toward the end. I'd rather hit
.260 or .270 and drive in more runs than I did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who during 1997 drove in 74 runs, remains on pace for
86 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting .300 once does not make you a .300 hitter in the major
leagues,'' Stevens said. ``Will Clark is a .300 hitter, but it did
prove to me that it can be done _ and I think I can still get hot.
It's not out of reach.'' FARM REPORT
</P>
<P>
   _ Triple-A Oklahoma (Pacific Coast League): The RedHawks (33-24)
beat Memphis, 10-3, Wednesday as left-hander Matt Perisho (7-5)
earned the victory Wednesday by allowing two runs on six hits and
five walks during 51/3 innings. Third baseman Tom Quinlan went
3-for-5 with a home run and five runs batted in. Quinlan leads the
PCL with 53 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   _ Double-A Tulsa (Texas League): The Drillers (27-39) lost both
games of a doubleheader to Shreveport, 4-1 and 3-2. Second baseman
Warren Morris' hitting streak was snapped at 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Class-A Charlotte (Florida State League): The Rangers (40-21)
beat Clearwater, 9-4, as shortstop Kelly Dransfeldt hit his 13th
home run this season and fifth during the past eight games.
Dransfeldt needs two more to match Charlotte's single-season
record.
</P>
<P>
   _ Class-A Savannah (South Atlantic League): The Sand Gnats
(30-36) lost to Augusta, 8-0, in a game called during the sixth
inning because of rain. Right-hander Aaron Bond allowed eight runs
(seven earned) on 11 hits during 51/3 innings.

FREE AGENCY SETS PIPPEN FREE OF BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ You should've seen the grin. It was devious,
liberated, warranted. And it beamed from Scottie Pippen like a man
leaving Alcatraz for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   See, the sentence is about to expire, the suppression nearly
over. One victory away from a place he has always wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   In demand. In control. And if Jerry Colangelo is smart, on his
way to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play without him is like a slap in the face for me,''
Michael Jordan said. ``But I want him to do well. I think he's
entitled to find out what his net worth is.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Bulls brace themselves for a final farewell, a weepy
sentiment is emerging and the posturing has already begun. On
Thursday, Phil Jackson talked about rays of hope that could prolong
a dynasty. Jordan claimed his teammate is keeping his options open,
already putting the heat on ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Except Pippen walked into a room and slammed the door shut. And
you should've seen the grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really want to know?`` Pippen said. ``I want the
opportunity to go out and open all the doors to the free agent
market. I don't have any intentions of coming back here next
season, even though I stated a couple of days ago that I would look
to come back. I think this is the last run for this ballclub.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Many options &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, will it pave the way for Colangelo's first real banner?
</P>
<P>
   After a monstrous performance in the Finals, Pippen will find
plenty of suitors. He wants to be wanted, flooded with offers. And
while there were rumblings among agents last week that Pippen's
price tag will be too high for the Suns, a team that must allocate
some cap room for a center, this isn't about money alone.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he just ruled out the Bulls, which could be his most
lucrative option.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably is,'' Pippen said. ``But I don't want to come back
and play for four years and just go for a title for one season. I
have to look at the longevity of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Colangelo should be licking his chops. Pippen is
yearning for a new beginning, and the Suns are a perfect fit. And
whatever Colangelo can't give him in annual salary, he should give
him in years, just like A.C. Green.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, this is where Colangelo's reputation pays
off. This is when he can swoop in, provide a friendly haven for
abused athletes, show them an organization that doesn't run on
contention. Precisely what Pippen is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that's a stretch, know that Pippen makes $2.7
million a year. If you blame him for signing the contract, know
that other organizations willingly reward underpaid superstars. If
you can't relate to a millionaire livid over his working
conditions, know that every profession is relative, centered around
respect.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the vindictive tweakings Bulls' management has
directed at Pippen, one story tells all _ the day he asked General
Manager Jerry Krause if he could buy a championship trophy replica
only to hear he wasn't deserving. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Out of Jordan's shadow &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget the mindless chatter that Pippen can't survive without
Jordan, that he's not a fourth-quarter assassin. Forget the laundry
list, too. He is far removed from his petulant past, and in the
past three years, Pippen has matured greatly, emerging from
Jordan's shadow into a leader.
</P>
<P>
   No player is like Pippen, a stallion that has never been
unleashed in an up-tempo offense. He has championship pedigree. He
can show a team how to win.
</P>
<P>
   The real concern is how much he has left. Pippen will turn 33
later this year, and when you factor in two Olympic appearances and
six championship runs, no one has played more games in the past
decade. Risk or rationale?
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Classic Sports, the Suns versus Bulls in 1993, and I was
looking at the difference between Michael and Scottie in five
years,'' Jackson said. ``Scottie is still so terrific in his speed
and anticipation. He is always there, always a harassing person.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he will be there for the taking. And worth every penny. &QL;

THIS TIME, VAN POPPEL TAKES SLOWER ROUTE TO THE MAJORS
</HEADLINE>
 POPPEL-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers have this good-looking pitching prospect down
on the farm. A big guy, standing about 6-foot-5, with a live arm
that can fire a fastball in the low 90s.
</P>
<P>
   He has good command of the strike zone, and can throw four
pitches over the plate. Good attitude, too, willing to do whatever
the organization asks.
</P>
<P>
   He's having success at Triple-A Oklahoma, with a 5-2 record and
2.65 earned-run average in his past 10 starts. He leads the Pacific
Coast League in innings pitched (82) and is fourth in strikeouts
(66) and has walked only 22.
</P>
<P>
   He could be first in line to get the call if the Rangers decide
to make a change in their starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd have to be considered if there was a need for someone, no
doubt about it,'' Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, good-looking prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've heard of him. Goes by the name of Todd Van Poppel.
</P>
<P>
   The same Todd Van Poppel of Arlington who was on the scrap heap
a year ago after being released by his fourth organization in 10
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a prospect, given that he's having success at the
Triple-A level,'' farm director Reid Nichols said. ``If we need a
starter, it may be a toss-up between him and \RMatt\S Perisho.''
</P>
<P>
   That Van Poppel now is mentioned as a prospect is an indication
of how far he has come in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real happy with the way I'm throwing the ball,'' Van
Poppel said. ``I know I've still got some things to work on, but
I'm confident right now I could do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little doubt that Van Poppel would do the job when he
left Martin High School in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He was the Kerry Wood of that year, a hard-throwing right-hander
from a local high school _ Wood went to Grand Prairie High _ who
generally was considered the best young pitching prospect in the
land. Van Poppel made his major-league debut with the Oakland
Athletics as a 19-year-old in September 1991, and struck out five
of the first six big-league batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   But he never fulfilled that early promise. He went 20-33 with a
6.22 ERA in 3 1/2 seasons in the majors. Some said an arm injury
sustained in '92 was the problem. Others said he didn't get enough
minor-league seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel himself said information overload was a factor,
especially when he bounced from Oakland to Detroit to the Angels
organization to the Royals organization from August 1996 to April
'97.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically went through about nine different pitching
coaches,'' he said. ``That doesn't work, because everybody has
their own ideas and everybody has different ways to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   With three strikes against him, last June he received his fourth
in a 10-month period. He was released by the pitching-poor Royals
after going 1-5 with an 8.03 ERA in 11 games at Triple-A Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers _ his hometown team, the one he dreamed about
pitching for when he was growing up in Arlington _ offered a deal.
But there was a catch. The onetime Boy Wonder had to go back to
Class A and start all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel swallowed his pride, and agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the only way for me to get back to the big leagues was
to start at ground zero,'' he said. ``Going back to A ball was
starting from ground zero, and I had no problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He went 0-4 with a 4.04 ERA in the Florida State League, and 3-3
with a 5.06 ERA after being moved up to Double-A Tulsa. The numbers
perhaps didn't reflect it, but he was showing progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers coaches helped simplify his pitching motion, and he
was able to work on changing his motion until he felt comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's wanted to say this is your problem, do this, this
is your problem, do that,'' he said. ``I've never had an
opportunity to stay with one thing for a long period of time where
I can get comfortable with it and find my own rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers bullpen coach Larry Hardy did a little tinkering after
the season, and Van Poppel went to Venezuela to pitch winter ball.
</P>
<P>
   He went 3-2 with a 2.27 ERA, fifth in the league. He is
repeating that success at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   And, once again is a prospect, albeit an older one. The former
teen-age sensation is 26. Older, but not too old.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, pitchers don't develop until they're 25 or
26,'' Melvin said. ``You hear scouts talk about him. They say he's
pitching a lot better than they had seen him previously.''
</P>
<P>
   Older, but not in any particular hurry to make it back to the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the farthest thing from my mind,'' he said. ``I just
want to keep improving. That's my main focus. I don't want to rush
back up there until I'm 100 percent ready. When I go back up I want
to be ready and be able to stay for a long time. I know I've got
the ability to go up there and pitch well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers must be sure he is ready to stay for a long time
before making the call. Van Poppel is out of minor-league options,
so he can't be sent back to the minors without going through
waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That weighs into it, whether your need is for short term or
long term,'' Melvin said. ``You couldn't bring him up for one start
and then send him back out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Van Poppel is willing to wait. When you're a prospect you
know your time _ even if it's your second time _ is coming.

SAN-SATIONAL RACE IN WORKS IN NL WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enough about the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Fox bunch and their
underachieving warriors have made enough headlines for one season.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to focus on the National League West race and the
Dodgers have had absolutely nothing to do with that. They may
eventually get their act together, but right now it's between the
San Francisco Giants and the San Diego Padres, and, starting
tonight, those two play each other seven times in the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams are everything the Dodgers aren't: tough, gritty
and resourceful, a bunch of hard-nosed ballplayers who get the most
out of their talent. Just look at their third basemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants may have one of the best players in the game in Barry
Bonds, but their character comes from Bill Mueller, a slow-footed
third baseman with no power who simply hits around .300, makes the
routine play in the field and goes all-out for nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are all about Ken Caminiti, who earned National
League most valuable player honors in 1996 by hitting .326 with 40
homers and 130 runs batted in despite playing much of the second
half with a torn rotator cuff that needed surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres were leading the division for the first two months
until the Giants caught them with an 11-game winning streak. But
injuries have also hurt; Caminiti, Tony Gwynn and Wally Joyner have
missed significant time because of nagging injuries. Gwynn has a
strained calf muscle and is not expected to play this weekend
against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get everybody healthy at the same time,'' Padres
manager Bruce Bochy said.
</P>
<P>
   Three players have saved them. Starter Andy Ashby is 8-4 with a
2.21 earned-run average, closer Trevor Hoffman (18-for-18 on saves
with a 1.63 ERA) has been outstanding and Greg Vaughn has revived
his deteriorating career with 22 home runs and 56 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres could use some help. Like everybody else, they could
use another starting pitcher, plus a catcher and a shortstop. There
was talk of them taking a shot at obtaining Mike Piazza or trading
for a shortstop, either Royce Clayton or Edgar Renteria.
</P>
<P>
   Owner John Moores and general manager Kevin Towers are likely to
do everything they can, because this is a critical year. San Diego
voters will decide in November on funding for a new stadium, and a
division championship would do wonders for the Padres' cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are getting a new downtown stadium in 2000, and
everything points to this franchise becoming a powerhouse by then,
especially if the Athletics finally get out of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants aren't doing too badly right now, mainly because
Dusty Baker remains one of the best managers in the game and Brian
Sabean has proven to be a resourceful, astute general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Last off-season, the Giants couldn't afford to re-sign
free-agent shortstop Jose Vizcaino, who defected to the Dodgers.
Instead, they settled on an inexpensive platoon of Rich Aurilia and
Rey Sanchez, two ex-Rangers minor leaguers who are both hitting
above .300 and playing good defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sabean also improved his bullpen by getting Robb Nen (19 saves,
1.30 ERA) from Florida and Steve Reed (2-0, 1.23 ERA) from the
Rockies, and strengthened his bench by getting Charlie Hayes, who
is hitting .311 as a backup at third and first base. But his best
acquisition was 39-year-old pitcher Orel Hershiser, who went 5-0 in
May and is 6-4 with a 3.19 ERA for the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants also benefit from another ex-Rangers player: center
fielder Darryl Hamilton. Not only is he hitting .295, but his
upbeat leadership creates a positive atmosphere in the clubhouse
and provides a counter-balance for the moody Bonds. It's no
coincidence Hamilton has played for division winners in each of his
last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Giants nor the Padres have the Dodgers' immense
talent. But they're the ones who are in a pennant race, and the
next 10 days should be fun.

IN OVERTIME, WINGS EDGE CLOSER TO TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Their goalie made another critical mistake to allow
another shabby goal that threw his team into a tailspin. Because of
this, they squandered an early lead and fell behind by two goals _
not once but twice. They lost an important attacker with an injury
midway through the game. So what would the Detroit Red Wings do for
the rest of Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals last night in Joe
Louis Arena?
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by two with less than 12 minutes remaining, the
defending champions resumed their whirlwind attack, scoring two
goals to send the game into overtime. And then they triggered a
long, loud dance of delirium in their sweltering home rink by
winning it at 15 minutes 24 seconds of the extra period on a goal
by Kris Draper.
</P>
<P>
   A checking specialist without a goal in this tournament, Draper
jumped on the ice from the bench, charged unchecked to the net,
took a long pass across the slot from Martin Lapointe and put the
puck behind goalie Olaf Kolzig for a 5-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize it was going to be an overtime goal in the
Stanley Cup finals, but I'll take it,'' Draper said of his first
playoff goal this spring. ``This is what you dream about. I just
one-timed it into the open net. You can tell by my smile how
excited I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The result gave the Red Wings a 2-0 lead in the
four-of-seven-game championship series that will resume on Saturday
night with Game 3 in Washington. They swept the Philadelphia Flyers
last season. Every championship round since 1994 has ended in the
minimum four games.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Yzerman, the Detroit captain, scored two of the Detroit
goals, one while shorthanded. Lapointe and Doug Brown scored in the
third period to tie it. Peter Bondra, Chris Simon, Adam Oates and
Joe Juneau scored for the Capitals, who had won five consecutive
overtime games in this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   They might have short-circuited a Detroit comeback in the middle
of the third period had Esa Tikkanen finished a scoring chance.
Shortly after Lapointe cut the Washington lead to 4-3, Tikkanen
found himself alone in front of Detroit's Chris Osgood, with the
goalie sprawled out of position. But Tikkanen shot the puck wide,
and Detroit resumed its comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Wilson, the Washington coach, said, ``We had the win right
on Esa Tikkanen's stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Tikkanen said: ``I had the open net like, three, four seconds.
Next time, I have to make sure that it is in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the overtime, Detroit had a 12-3 edge in shots on goal. For
the game, the Detroit advantage was 60-33. The Wings began the game
with their dazzling, swirling attack _ skating, passing, shooting
with grace and energy _ and seemed en route to a rout until Osgood
let down his guard on a confusing play at 1:51 of the second
period. When Washington's Jeff Brown cleared the puck from his end
of the ice, it appeared at first that icing would be called against
the Capitals. But no Red Wing got to the puck as it crossed the
Detroit goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Because Washington's Andrei Nikolishin had touched the puck as
it passed through the neutral zone, an off-sides possibility no
longer held. So Peter Bondra raced to the puck and fired it behind
Osgood from a bad angle in the left-wing faceoff circle. In the
three previous rounds, Osgood has given up three goals on long
shots from outside his blue line, one against each opponent. This
time, his gaffe was to relax and to forget about defending his goal
when no whistle sounded to stop play.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling from this, the Wings then gave up two goals in the next
10 minutes to Simon and Oates, making it 3-1. Right after this,
Osgood tried to throw a puck at Washington's Craig Berube, after a
whistle. He missed and, instead, hit the referee, Don Koharski, and
got an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for his efforts. On a team
full of unflappable veterans, Osgood is an inconsistent and
undependable weak link.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman got one back while shorthanded early in the third
period, but Juneau made it 4-2 less than a minute later, on the
same power play, at 7:05. At this point, the Red Wings were being
taunted by Simon and other Capitals toughies. Instead of getting
mad, the Wings got even.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate Tikkanen missed the open net,'' Yzerman
said. ``That was the break we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   They surged without Slava Kozlov, one of their top attackers,
who left the game in the second period with a charley horse in his
leg after being checked hard and legally by Sergei Gonchar. His
condition is uncertain for the next game.

RODZILLA'S MONTSROUS DEFENSE LEAVES JAZZ WITH SOUR NOTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Deal with it America: Rodzilla is having his Jazz and
eating it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Between absurd antics off the court, freaky forward Dennis
Rodman's aggravating defense, boundless energy and timely scoring
has put a headlock on counterpart Karl Malone and helped give his
Chicago Bulls a stranglehold on their sixth NBA Championship in
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't discount what Dennis is doing,'' Michael Jordan
said. ``There's no understanding him. But as long as he does his
job on the court like this, it's really hard to argue with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely in part to Rodman becoming a most-valuable-player
candidate by going postal on The Mailman, this Finals rematch has
become a mismatch and the Bulls' ``Last Dance'' is likely down to
its final step. Chicago, 33-4 in playoff games at the United
Center, takes a 3-1 lead and the opportunity to clinch its Repeat
Three-Peat into Friday's Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   No team has recovered from a 3-1 deficit to win a Finals series.
With Jordan playing a full season, no team has beaten the Bulls in
a series since they lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 1990 Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is, in fact, the end, it's been a great run,'' Bulls
coach Phil Jackson said. ``And Dennis, in his own way, has been a
huge part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman _ who debuted a Godzilla-green-and-black hairdo in Game 1
_ has had a particularly newsworthy series off the court.
</P>
<P>
   He has jetted off to gamble in Las Vegas and wrestle in Detroit,
gotten sued by a casino dealer and a woman in Las Vegas for sexual
harassment, fined by the NBA and dissed by Jazz coach Jerry Sloan,
missed a practice, not sat on the bench for tip-offs and called
Malone ``awkward'' and ``average.''
</P>
<P>
   A night after skipping practice to wrestle in Detroit, Rodman
had drinks with Illinois state Sen. William Marovitz at a Rush
Street tavern before heading to his notorious Crobar Club all-night
lair.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a civil, intellectual side to Dennis that people
rarely get to see,'' Marovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Rodman told his agent, Dwight Manley, to pay for the
funeral of James Byrd, the African-American dragged to his death
near Jasper in East Texas. Three white men have been charged with
murder in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll cost around $20,000 to do it right,'' Manley said. ``But
Dennis was moved by the incident and he wants to do what he can to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rodman: ``My heart goes out to the family and it's a shame
when something like this happens.''
</P>
<P>
   He's hung around wrestler Hulk Hogan and Pearl Jam lead singer
Eddie Vedder, and hung all over Malone. The Jazz star, who figured
to average at least 30 points per game against Chicago's inferior
interior, grows hair in his television commercial. In his Finals
nightmare, however, he is growing horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refs have let me play,'' Rodman said. ``When they do that,
Karl Malone is not effective against me at all. I have too much
heart for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, more popular in Utah than the Osmonds or The Mormon
Tabernacle Choir, has disappeared in key stretches under the
despised Rodman's defensive blanket. Since Malone knocked down late
jumpers to force overtime in Game 1, Rodzilla has destroyed him
and, in turn, Utah's offense. In Game 2, Malone was 0-of-4 in the
second half. In Game 3, he went 2-of-5 the last 39 minutes. In
Wednesday's Game 4, he went 1-of-3 in the final 12 minutes, with
the only basket a meaningless jumper in the final 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have to prove anything to anybody in this country or
this business,'' Rodman said when asked if his substance has
legitimized his style.
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, Malone averaged 27 points and the
Jazz 101. In this series, he's been held to 20 per game and his
team to a Finals record-low 78.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know,'' said Malone, who has scored more than
23 points in only one of 10 Finals games against Chicago. ``You
can't pinpoint it. I have chances to score against Dennis. But you
guys are the experts now, so why do you even ask those questions?''
</P>
<P>
   So exactly how has the synchronized, seasoned Jazz been
discombobulated by a head-butting, crotch-kicking, tattooed Worm?
</P>
<P>
   Giving up three inches and 50 pounds to the NBA's second-best
player, the 37-year-old Rodman has successfully climbed inside
Malone's head as well as onto his body. Using a defensive tenacity
developed in the South Oak Cliff neighborhood in Dallas, improved
at tiny Southeastern Oklahoma State and polished to perfection
during a 12-year career that has seen him bedevil offensive stars
from Larry Bird to David Robinson, Rodman has refused to surrender
low-post position to Malone.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, Rodman called a heady timeout during a loose-ball
scramble, convincing veteran referee Bill Oakes that his team had
the ball when replays showed a tie possession. A minute before, he
had drilled a foul-line jumper to tie the score and jump-start
Chicago's rally to a five-point victory.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 4, he outfought Malone for a loose ball and drew a foul
on the series' most important play. Instead of giving Utah the ball
and a chance to tie the score in the final minute, Rodman earned _
and calmly sank despite being only a 55 percent shooter _ two free
throws to put the Bulls in position to smell Utah's blood and
clearly see their finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's precisely why we put up with Dennis,'' reserve guard
Steve Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Rodman's deep impact has come from neutralizing Malone
and disrupting Utah's pet pick-and-roll. After Malone has hit open
jumpers early in the past two games, Rodman has entered and played
him much more closely and physically than starter Luc Longley.
Rodman's quickness and desire allows him to step out and
momentarily impede Jazz point guard John Stockton, then scurry back
to alter or even altogether prevent a Malone jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's his technique or just his attitude about
playing in crucial situations,'' Jordan said. ``Whatever, you've
got to commend him. Just don't try to dissect him as an individual,
if he is in fact an individual. When time is of the essence, he's
ready to play basketball. He excels in adversity. It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Rodman could have only 11 points _ along with 39 rebounds
and 0 technical fouls _ and be such a dominating factor. Given
Malone's anticipated dominance but subsequent disappearance, Rodman
will receive NBA Finals MVP votes should he continue his trend
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He also likely will receive the fifth NBA Championship ring of
his 12-year career for his contributions to a Bulls dynasty that
featured the game's greatest and weirdest players: Air and Airhead.
Where Rodman, who has jewelry in his navel, ears and nose, will
choose to wear the ring remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to back himself into a corner and come out of it with
shining laurels,'' said Jackson. ``He got himself in situation
where he had to prove himself, then he does it.''

MAN DIES AS CLIMBERS ON MOUNT RAINIER ARE HIT BY AVALANCHE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A dozen climbers nearly 12,000 feet up Mount Rainier
were caught in an avalanche on Thursday afternoon. One person was
killed, five were hurt and six were able to stop their falls and
were uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   The man who died had fallen the farthest and spent several hours
dangling by a rope off a rock formation called Disappointment
Cleaver, said a Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman, Maria
Gillett. His identity was not released on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The five injured climbers, who had been attached to the same
rope as the man who died, were pulled to safety by 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Of the injured climbers, one had a knee injury, two had injured
hands and a couple were suffering from hypothermia, said Dawn
Adams, another Park Service spokeswoman. All of them were flown to
a hospital in Fort Lewis, near Tacoma, she said. The uninjured
climbers climbed back down to Camp Muir, the base camp.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 were being led by Rainier Mountaineering, the only
guiding company that operates on that side of the mountain, she
said. They were descending when the avalanche hit; it was not clear
if they had reached the summit of the 14,410-foot peak, about 60
miles southeast of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers were notified of the accident about 2:30 p.m. by another
climber on the mountain who was using a cellular phone. Rescuers
reached the climbers within an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The large rock formation, which splits the Emmons and Ingraham
Glaciers, is at 11,500 feet and is named Disappointment Cleaver
because many people who fail to reach the summit turn around at
that point, said Gus Bush, operations leader for Tacoma Mountain
Rescue, which sent 12 volunteers to assist.
</P>
<P>
   The injured climbers appeared to have gone over an edge and
stopped their fall with their ice axes, said a park spokesman, Dave
Uberuaga, but they were on too steep a slope to return to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue had been hampered by weather, with a low cloud
ceiling that made it difficult to dispatch helicopters to the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Search dogs had been called to the scene, Uberuaga said, adding
that he did not know how many other parties were climbing on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Spring snow often turns to a slushy consistency, especially in
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat today and the sun coming down on it, probably
triggered it,'' Bush said. Temperatures have recently reached the
upper 70s and lower 80s.
</P>
<P>
   The worst climbing accident on Mount Rainier occurred on June
21, 1981, when 11 people died in an ice fall at 11,000 feet on a
guided climb.

   The NBA playoffs have provided more bewilderment than
pork-and-beans underwear:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)For the second year in a row, the regular-season
powerhouse Sonics failed in the second round, playing less
competitively than in the previous season against Houston, despite
having what former coach George Karl believed to be his best, most
enjoyable team, which was free of Shawn Kemp's distractions.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The team that eliminated the Sonics, the Los Angeles
Lakers, appeared to be the greatest new dynasty since the Mings
dominated the old Eastern Conference. Then the Lakers were swept in
the Western finals.

   (BBOX)The team that swept the Lakers, the Utah Jazz, is on the
verge of elimination by Friday's fifth game in the NBA Finals
against the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of this sequence five weeks ago was about the
same as an exchange of Valentines between Karl and Sonic president
Wally Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in terms of the improbable, these outcomes pale compared
with what Bulls coach Phil Jackson has achieved with Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's brilliant contribution in Game 4 _ superb defense on
Karl Malone, spirit-crushing offensive rebounding and five of six
free throws _ was the unexpected stiletto slicing Utah's title
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman prepared for this moment by cavorting with steroid freaks
in Detroit, joining in a pro rasslin' promotion that was heavy on
dollies, cigars and nationally televised imbecilism.
</P>
<P>
   This adventure was preceded by a Las Vegas sojourn after Game 1
in Salt Lake City that included heavy drinking, gambling and
all-night lasciviousness. The week also was spiced with a lawsuit
by a Vegas craps dealer who claimed that Rodman in October rubbed
the guy's head, stomach and crotch while shooting dice.
</P>
<P>
   No word yet from any animal-protection society on assaults on
farm livestock.
</P>
<P>
   While the history of pro sports is littered with stories of
prodigious bacchanalia by jocks convinced of the myth of their
invulnerability, almost none has included an athlete who was a) 37;
b) an unrepentant irritant to teammates and coaches by breaking
nearly every team rule, and c) eager to have writers and cameras
record his silliness.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent international circus he has created is normally
anathema to every principle of team sports. Yet somehow Jackson has
kept Rodman and his phony, self-indulgent chaos from compromising
the title pursuit in a season when the Bulls appeared to be their
most vulnerable against an astute challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN analyst and longtime NBA coach Jack Ramsay said it the
other night for many in the league who have shaken their heads
until dizzy:
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil Jackson is the only coach in the NBA who could have
handled Rodman. I know I couldn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker needs no more reason than that to keep open the Sonic
coaching search that will otherwise go to Paul Westphal, all along
the likeliest candidate since Karl began self-destructing before
the season.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the Sonics are about to pursue impending free
agent Rodman, although they could do worse. But the Sonics have
their own curious talent in Gary Payton, the only part remaining
from the Karl-Kemp-Payton triumvirate that has kept the Sonics
among the elites.
</P>
<P>
   Payton has advocated for Paul Silas, someone he knows and trusts
and is fairly certain he could manipulate as he did Karl, who
virtually quit trying to get Payton to conform to team rules. As
with Rodman, Payton almost always delivered on the court, which
gave him leverage to skip practice and skirt other
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Westphal is something of an unknown, although
his indulgence of another my-way-or-the-highway superstar, Charles
Barkley, helped lead to his demise as coach of the Suns. Teammates
such as Kevin Johnson and A.C. Green grew to resent the double
standard for Barkley by Westphal, much as some Sonics resented the
same with Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Managing the double standard is the toughest coaching trick in
the NBA. The treatment expected by top players often is divisive to
the point of destruction. Coaches like Ramsay, Jerry Sloan and most
others in the league have little or no capacity to indulge profound
deviants like Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was aided by Michael Jordan, whose overwhelming
psychological dominance of the Bulls has helped moderate Rodman's
impact. Yet Jackson had to set the attitude and atmosphere so
Jordan could accept Rodman's knotheadedness in order to extract his
valued virtues.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's his attributes derived from Zen or zookeeping,
Jackson has been marvelous in keeping the Bulls directed despite
their disparate personalities and the internal and external forces
arrayed against their continued success.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says he will not be back with the Bulls, and will take
time off before deciding his future, which could include no
coaching for a year.
</P>
<P>
   It behooves Walker to keep the Sonic door open until Jackson
closes it. Westphal isn't going anywhere _ which could be the Sonic
fate if Payton isn't better directed.
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight year, Jackson put a porcupine in a baby's
crib. No cries have been heard. Here is a nanny for the ages.

By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Magic Johnson was one of the first to see up close how
dominant the Chicago Bulls were going to be in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In '91, his Los Angeles Lakers won Game 1 of the NBA Finals in
Chicago before losing the next four games as the Bulls won the
first of their five championships.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bulls on the verge of their sixth title and Michael
Jordan apparently on the verge of retirement, Johnson is as sad as
anyone. How emotional? Asked what he thought of Jordan's departure
earlier this week, Johnson _ obviously practicing for his new talk
show _ offered this unique and insightful filibuster, complete with
a plea for His Airness not to hang up his Nikes:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about ultimate excellence and when you talk
about beautiful basketball, the way the game is supposed to be
played, the way Mr. Naismith drew it up to be played, you're
talking about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason I'm disappointed at the young people in this
league, and, yes, some veterans, is because they look at Michael
and they don't understand Michael. They see ``the greatest'' but
they don't know why he is so great. They miss the point. They don't
remember or realize that when he first came into the league, he was
a star whose game was confined to driving to the basket, dunking on
everybody and making other fantastic moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you'd try to block his dunk, he'd learn to kill you some
other way. So over the years, people missed out on the fact that he
worked hard to add the jump shot, the 3-point basket, the post-up
moves, the passing and the great defense and team leadership. It
was like he'd say, `OK, now that y'all have seen this part of my
game and adapted a little to it, I'm going to add this to it, too.
Now what y'all going to do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then later on he'd say, `Now I think I'd post up and shoot the
fade-away J a little.' Other times he'd say, `I think I'll beat you
with my passing this time.' But you see so many guys in this league
who don't understand the progression of his greatness. They don't
realize that he evolved into what he is now through hard work and
tremendous dedication. That's why I love Michael. He worked to
become the complete player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not his last year because I think he has two good
years left. But I don't think Michael knows what he really wants to
do afterward. And it may take him another year just to decide what
he'll do after basketball. Remember, he is already the chairman of
the board with his own shoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Michael _ we need you one more year. Michael, please don't
go. The league needs you and these players sure need you. And I
need you, too, as a fan because I'll tell you the truth: I don't
know how much basketball I'd even want to watch without Michael.
You see _ Michael, Phil Jackson and Pat Riley and very few others
understand the real beauty of five guys playing the game together.
They understand how to compete and get guys going. So I can't see
the league without Michael because we are not ready and there's
nobody ready to take his place.'' RUNNING OF THE BULLS
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have won their past eight Finals home games. ... Most
of the talk Thursday surrounded closing the series out at home and
avoiding a return trip to Salt Lake City. ``I have no business in
Utah at all,'' Dennis Rodman said. ``Those people are a different
breed.'' Added Jordan, ``If this happens to be our last dance, why
not finish it in front of our fans?'' ALL THAT JAZZ
</P>
<P>
   In a series in which it has been difficult to differentiate
between good defense and bad offense, the Jazz has not surpassed 88
points and are averaging a Finals record-low 78 per game. ... One
reason for that is its 3-point shooting. The Jazz, the fifth-best
team from long range during the regular season, has made only 10 of
45 (22 percent) in the series and missed 13 of 15 in Game 4. ...
Utah's concentration Thursday focused on the series not being over.
``I have both arms and legs and I plan to fight them again
\RFriday\S,'' coach Jerry Sloan said. Added point guard John
Stockton, ``We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I'm still
kicking, we're still kicking.'' JORDAN WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, facing what will definitely be his last game of
the season at the United Center, said he'll try to approach the
game unemotionally. ``It's going to be hard for me to not think
it's my last game,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Other than again ruling out a role as player-coach, Jordan shed
no light on his plans for next season. He did however, say he
believes teammate Scottie Pippen has left a crack in the door to
return to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the opportunity to go out on top,'' Pippen
said. ``But I don't have any intention of coming back here next
season.'' Inside the numbers Closer than it looks: Three of the
games have been decided by five or fewer points and in the final 45
seconds. Chicago has won seven of the 10 Finals games against Utah
the past two years, five by five of fewer points. HE SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic because we don't want it to end, yet we can't wait
until it's over.'' _ Bulls guard Steve Kerr, on his team being one
victory away from a championship and a probable breakup. THE FINALS
SCENE
</P>
<P>
   With the possibility that Friday's game will be the last for
Jordan and the Bulls' dynasty, tickets are up to as much as $10,000
for two courtside seats. Film critic Gene Siskel, talk-show host
Jerry Springer, actor Bill Murray, religious leader Louis Farrakhan
and singers Donny Osmond, Eddie Vedder and Brooks &AMP; Dunn are
expected to have good seats.

WINDY CITY PREPARES FOR MEMORABLE PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The anticipation is almost a ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's police force is primed to work overtime Friday night.
Local stores are being depleted of plywood stock to cover windows
against potential looters. And some Chicago Bulls players _
especially Michael Jordan _ already are being asked to send a
party-but-don't-tear-up-this-town message to their fans.
</P>
<P>
   No, a tornado is not about to hit outside the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   And no, the NBA Finals are not over.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls own a 3-1 lead over the Utah Jazz, and the history
of never having lost a playoff series with that kind of advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If the five-time NBA champion Bulls finish off Utah in Friday
night's Game 5, or do so later, there will be something different
about what has become a routine party: Chicago will celebrate
winning a sixth ring, but it will come with an emotional end to an
eight-year dynasty because the existing team probably will break
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard for me not to think of it in that way,''
Jordan said Thursday. ``I'm going to try to think of it in a way
that we're finishing off the season. From the beginning we wanted
to play and win our last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to get this thing done here, in Chicago. . . . If
this happens to be the last dance, why not do it in front of our
fans?''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter the outcome of the Finals, the end is near for
this roster of the Bulls, and they know it.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen _ a free agent as of July 1 _ reiterated Thursday
that he has no desire to play with the Bulls past this season.
Jordan does not want to retire. But he is prepared to do so, unlike
when he walked off the court to play baseball after winning the NBA
championship in 1993. Without Pippen, Jordan knows he will be
better off selling cologne and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who said at the start of
this season ``that wild horses couldn't bring me back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This (championship) would mean more to us, especially to
myself and Michael and Phil,'' Pippen said. ``We'd love to have the
opportunity to go out on top. That's been the drive for us the
whole season. We want to prove that we're still the greatest and
we're still champions.''
</P>
<P>
   A sixth championship in eight years makes a compelling argument
for the Bulls being considered the greatest team ever. Only Houston
also won championships this decade, in 1994 and 1995, the two years
Jordan spent in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is an era when the NBA competition is diluted
because of expansion, the individual talent of the league is
arguably at its highest level. The game will lose Jordan, perhaps
the greatest basketball player the game has ever known. It also
means Jordan will loosen his stranglehold on the NBA trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't miss it (the NBA) at all, as much as you may
think,'' Jordan said. ``I've got enough memories to suffice and
overcome that.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Bulls opponent in the NBA Finals has sat like a guy in the
wrong seat during a high-stakes card game. This time, the Jazz are
holding the bad hands while watching Jordan, Pippen and Dennis
Rodman trump them for the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's John Stockton is being rendered invisible. His partner
Karl Malone is groping to come up big. The Jazz won a league-best
62 games this season. But Utah has been hemmed in in this series by
the Bulls' defense and desire to win.
</P>
<P>
   There was a suggestion in the Utah locker room after Game 4
Wednesday night that Stockton and Malone were playing scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel they're scared,'' Pippen said. ``I feel like we
have them off balance from a defensive standpoint. We're sending so
many different defensive schemes at them, they don't know what to
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls will be remembered for their success, sideshow-like
settings and ability to sell out arenas from Chicago to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Their success has sparked jealousy, as well as adulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans want to see a new champion because they're tired of
Bulls, Bulls, Bulls,'' Jazz veteran Antoine Carr said. ``It's time
for some fresh blood and new faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fan support picked up after we knocked out the Lakers.
Even their fans wished us good luck. They said the Bulls are a
great team, but their soap opera has gotten old. But we can't worry
about that. We've got to win some games.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah must win three straight games to dethrone the Bulls. The
last time the Bulls dropped three straight games was February 1995
before Jordan returned. With Jordan, you would have to go back to
the start of the 1990-91 season when the Bulls lost their first
three games. That was also the Bulls' first title season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls went on to claim three straight titles. They are
poised for another three-peat. Only the 1960s Boston Celtic teams
dominated a decade like the Bulls have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess everybody is talking about our age and the limitations
in terms of what we can do,'' Jordan said. ``That's a great
challenge. I love that. I'm pretty sure we're proving to a lot of
people that they're not great predictors or that they don't know
that much about the game. I think that's fun _ to see people eat
crow.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the Bulls will force everyone to digest the dynasty.

BUHNER'S BACK, BUT MARINERS LOSE TO A'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Mariner right fielder Jay Buhner waited more
than two months to be in this situation.
</P>
<P>
   He walked to home plate in the eighth inning Thursday night with
two runners on base, two outs and his team three runs behind.
</P>
<P>
   A home run might have been too much to ask, but that didn't keep
the Mariners from dreaming. They envisioned a game-tying homer from
the slugger who hit 40 or more in each of the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to come back from knee surgery?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought he was going to do it,'' M's hitting coach
Jesse Barfield said. ``He had some good cuts, but ... ''
</P>
<P>
   The potential storybook finish had a sour ending. Buhner
grounded out against Oakland's Billy Taylor, and the M's returned
to the American League West basement with a 5-2 loss to the
Athletics before 7,838 fans _ the smallest crowd to watch Seattle
this season.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the triumphant return the Mariners expected. You can
blame Oakland starter Mike Oquist and Taylor for that.
</P>
<P>
   Oquist, winning his fourth straight, made key pitches when he
had to, kept the ball down and left three runners in scoring
position as the Mariners went 0-for-8 with runners on third or
second bases.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle finally broke through in the eighth when Joey Cora
singled with one out and Ken Griffey Jr. slugged his league-leading
26th homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throwing a fastball over the plate to Junior is death,''
Oquist said.
</P>
<P>
   Losing pitcher Jeff Fassero kept everything the A's hit in the
park, but two walks and a wild pitch in the fourth inning led to
the first runs of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walks weren't as damaging as the wild pitch,'' said
Fassero, now 5-3. ``If I don't throw the wild pitch, I might get a
double play and get out of the inning with only one or no runs
being scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Oquist, meanwhile, didn't encounter serious trouble until the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey provided part of it with a 400-plus foot blast to
left-center. And after David Segui and Edgar Martinez singled off
reliever Mike Fetters, Buhner was in position to take care of the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give Jay one or two more days and he will hit some of the
pitches (he saw in the eighth inning) out of the ballpark,''
Barfield said. ``He doesn't quite trust his hands yet, but a few
more (batting practice sessions) will level out his swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner took treatment on his knee after the game and wasn't
available for comment, but he told team trainer Rick Griffin that
he felt fine.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey said he, too, thought Buhner would go deep in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been a good start for the ballclub and for
Jay,'' said Griffey, who shaved off his mustache and goatee
yesterday morning to symbolize a fresh start. ``He had some good
swings. He battled.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner's teammates trumpeted his return with a T-shirt that
read: ``Unleash the Dogs'' on the front and ``The Bone is Back'' on
the back.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, sidelined since April 6 with an injured left knee that
required surgery on April 28, went 1-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked good for being out so long,'' manager Lou Piniella
said. ``If he keeps that same approach, he will help us out and
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   And, boy, do the M's need help.
</P>
<P>
   On June 11 last season, their Big Three starters _ Randy
Johnson, Jamie Moyer and Fassero _ were a combined 20-5 and Seattle
was in first place by one-half game.
</P>
<P>
   As of today, they are 13-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have pitched that poorly,'' Fassero said,
``but it seems like when we pitch well, we don't get enough run
support. It's something you have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes prove costly. Walks score. And key hits are too rare.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' 58th error of the season helped the A's score two
runs in the fifth inning and expand their lead to four runs.
Shortstop Alex Rodriguez misfired after fielding Mike Macfarlane's
routine grounder leading off the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Segui, the M's first baseman, attempted to keep his right foot
on the bag as he leaned toward home plate to grab Rodriguez's
slighly errant throw but couldn't quite pull it off. Ryan
Christenson bunted Macfarlane into scoring position and Rickey
Henderson rapped a first-pitch double past third baseman Russ
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Not satisfied with two bases, Henderson quickly stole third, his
24th theft of the season. He was there only long enough to trot
home on Scott Spiezio's single to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero has been victimized the most this season by defensive
leaks. The fifth inning unearned run was the 11th scored off the
left-hander. In all, Seattle opponents have scored 28 unearned runs
this season. Only Kansas City and the Chicago White Sox have
surrendered more freebies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do about unearned runs,'' he said.
``But it kind of epitomizes our season.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without Buhner in the lineup.

NORTHRIDGE'S NEXT STEP IS TO FOLLOW THROUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RIZZA YAP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE _ Keith Richman remembers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Thursday morning. He and his wife were scanning
newspapers when a story jumped off the page. Cal State Northridge
had dropped four men's sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure wish I could do something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richman did.
</P>
<P>
   He headed a group of 14 others _ students, faculty, alumni and
community members _ charged by the state legislature to review
Northridge athletics. It accomplished what administrators could not
when money problems and stringent gender-equity requirements led
them to cut teams.
</P>
<P>
   They gave the public a voice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more upsetting than canceling baseball, men's soccer,
men's swimming and men's volleyball last summer was the process.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators didn't conduct a public forum. Athletic director
Paul Bubb said last year it would only pit neighbors, coaches and
athletes against each other.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, officials finalized the decision in early June,
when most student-athletes had left for the summer. Many who stayed
learned of their fate through the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, university president Blenda Wilson left for Newport
Beach on school business when Bubb and student affairs vice
president Ronald Kopita announced the cuts. She was unavailable
until the following day.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the community believed officials didn't care, the
sports were cut haphazardly and that no alternatives were explored.
</P>
<P>
   So in September _ three months after canceling the sports and a
month after a one-time state grant of $586,000 brought them back
for a year _ Wilson asked Richman to chair the Task Force on
Intercollegiate Athletics. Friends told him to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people advised me not do it,'' Richman said.
``They thought it was a no-win situation. Obviously, I'm a
reasonably optimistic person.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman took the job and made it clear that he wanted to find a
way to retain all of the sports. After three months of public
meetings and a community-wide forum, the task force submitted a
200-page report that emphatically urged one thing: Keep all 20
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Days after receiving the report, Wilson announced that CSUN is
committed to maintaining a broad-based program _ as long as
resources allow that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Long-term planning
</P>
<P>
   The longterm fate of CSUN sports remains in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the state of California is wealthier by billions,
and the economic windfall likely will stretch over the next
century. For the 1998-99 fiscal year, the Cal State University
system expects to receive $2.3 billion from the state, $293.2
million more than 1996-97. That financial surge has prompted Bubb
to ask Northridge for double the $1.5 million general fund
allocation it received last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has yet to approve the university's overall budget, but
Bubb is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good about the budget process,'' Bubb said.
``Enrollment may also go up, so we may get more money from (student
fees). Our spring fund drive went well, and with some of the
contests we have scheduled, our gate receipts should be good next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we get $3 million or (the task force-recommended) $2.6
from the general fund, we'll work with what we have and move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   And moving forward means something.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1994, Northridge has drafted plans for
the long term. Early this year, Bubb assembled a five-year budget
forecast to be updated annually, so the athletic department is
always looking five years ahead. The plan includes hiring a women's
water polo coach by this year and the addition of that sport plus
men's tennis by fall 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Another women's sport _ likely to be lacrosse, for which the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation sponsors _ will compete by 2000.
The forecast also shows, beginning this fall, each women's team
will receive the NCAA-maximum number of scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan only works if the general fund keeps giving CSUN
sports $3 million, if the school's Instructional Related Activities
fund and University Corporation continue to award them $600,000
each, student fees generate at least $1.6 million per year and
athletic revenues _ estimated at $1.1 million for the coming school
year _ make a steady rise.
</P>
<P>
   These figures must remain constant or improve until Northridge
develops the kind of private support needed to maintain a viable
Division I athletic program _ the kind that gave Fresno State $7.1
million to spend in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge is nearly $7 million away from that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising results vary
</P>
<P>
   At last count, CSUN's annual fund drive raised $200,000, with a
potential to grow by $50,000 by the end of the fiscal year. A
spring fund drive has raked in at least $78,000. But booster
support was nonexistent in four sports _ men's golf, men's
volleyball, women's tennis and women's volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the money raised this past weekend, administrators,
coaches and development staff this spring raised nearly $15,000 for
the football team, yet volunteers brought in just $50. For women's
soccer and the track and field/cross country program, boosters
raised $100 per team.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case with every sport.
</P>
<P>
   Men's soccer, whose booster club actively participated in
task-force meetings, raised the most money with $6,455; women's
basketball came in second with $5,825. Baseball raised $2,250, but
the figure comes from only two gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, many of the coaches didn't have solid ideas of who
could lead their booster clubs,'' said Michael Rehm, first-year
development director and former assistant at Montana. ``A lot of
them are still learning how to be Division I coaches, learning that
the public relations and fund-raising aspects are part of their
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Students, faculty, staff, community members and alumni scraped
and clawed to revive their teams, yet after the fight many
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance for men's volleyball improved by just 17, attracting
an average 433 fans at home this past season. In 1996, men's soccer
pulled a crowd of 605 per game; in 1997, the number climbed to 659.
The most surprising, however, is baseball, whose cancellation sent
many Valley residents reeling. The 1997 season attracted 273 per
home game. This year, an average of 216 showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attendance was average,'' said men's volleyball coach Jeff
Campbell, ``but we definitely have more financial support than
before.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keeping it afloat
</P>
<P>
   Institutional dollars can't keep feeding athletics. Somewhere
down the line, if Northridge wants to graduate from affordable to
healthy, the teams must move toward self-sufficiency. Community
outrage was not solely responsible for keeping CSUN at 20 sports.
Wilson admitted budget problems have dissipated for the 1998-99
school year mainly because the state could spare Northridge extra
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we can be OK, but (the goal is) for athletics
funding not to rely on additional state funds,'' Wilson said. ``If
we did not have the generosity of the state budget, clearly there
would be a problem. The (state's) $4.2 billion blip this year is a
first. Frankly, I'm nervous about what the next year will bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want sports,'' Wilson said. ``But do they understand
that sports cost money that could be used for our primary mission,
which is academics? My regret is that beyond the outcry, we have
not achieved increased public support (in game attendance and
monetary donations).''
</P>
<P>
   So how does Northridge survive in the long run?
</P>
<P>
   Rehm's hiring is one step. Previously, Northridge athletics
lacked a development officer for two years.
</P>
<P>
   As for football's lack of volunteer support, first-year head
coach Ron Ponciano looks to erase that problem by next year. In
May, he began a search for Northridge football alumni dating back
to 1962. He found 1,210 names, including nine who coach at local
high schools. He hopes to entice them into joining the athletic
association.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how hard fund-raisers work, private support
ultimately depends on the university's commitment _ as a whole _ to
its athletic program. Dropping four sports wounded Northridge's
development capacities in 1997; the scars haven't disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   This year has raised some new doubts. When Wilson decided to
temporarily delete a new football stadium from the university's
master plan, saying the university has not yet approved a site or
design, proponents were angered while opponents balked at the word
``temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always get the question, `What's going on with this football
stadium? How can you ask for my money if you keep going back and
forth?''' Rehm said.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, for now, is a committee Wilson plans to appoint. The
group will analyze CSUN's options for a stadium and look at how
existing facilities could improve. Until then, until the money
begins to roll in _ or at least becomes easier to bait _ Northridge
will have to rely on the efforts of coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   Or positive thinking like that of soccer player Mike Preis, who
said his team will bring home a conference championship. Or desire
and perseverance like that of baseball player Mike McNeely, one of
just five returners on the 1998 squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to play. We didn't care where, who against and
how we did it. We just wanted to play.''

GOP SWITCHES TACTICS ON CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here is how confused the House's debate over
campaign finance reform has become: Republicans brought to the
floor a reform measure they oppose Thursday, while Democrats voted
to kill the legislation, which they not only support but wrote.
</P>
<P>
   After that was settled, GOP leaders _ who had previously tried
to cut off all debate _ embarked on a procedure that could require
lawmakers to cast ballots on at least 258 amendments to 11 separate
reform measures.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings have grown so convoluted that one lawmaker felt
compelled to reach for words from television's ``X-Files'' to
explain her opponents' legislative tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obfuscate, inveigle and connive,'' Rep. Ellen Tauscher,
D-Walnut Creek, Calif., said of the GOP strategy, using words far
simpler than the rules under which the House will take up the
measures.
</P>
<P>
   As the House began what is expected to be a summer filled with
public posturing and private wrangling on the issue, partisans on
both sides conceded that the prospects of any meaningful reform
being enacted this year are close to zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislation this year? Oh, the chances are very, very slim,''
said Rep. Sam Farr, D-Carmel, Calif., author of one of the main
proposals. ``This debate is designed to be confusing. It's designed
to go on and on and on. It's designed to never have anyone coalesce
around any one bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders concede that they are opposed to changing the
system, in which they are raising more money than their Democratic
opponents. Yet their attempts to stifle debate earlier this year
backfired when a handful of GOP rebels threatened to join forces
with Democrats and force a vote on one of the most comprehensive
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Republican leaders have apparently settled on a new
strategy to defeat reform _ debate it to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this is another way for them to kill campaign finance
reform,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco. ``They had to be
dragged kicking and screaming into this debate in the first place.
The fact is, they like the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that limits on campaign donations amount to an
intrusion on free speech and are insisting that any overhaul of
campaign finance laws include restrictions on union contributions,
which go mostly to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And they insist that the parliamentary procedure they have
settled on is the only way to let everyone have their say, while at
the same time fulfilling a pledge to conduct a full and open
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine the outcry if they had restricted the debate,'' said
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., who has offered his own proposal to
prohibit donations from political action committees, unions and
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders have agreed to permit the 11 competing measures to
come to the House floor and have employed a legislative gambit
known as ``Queen of the Hill,'' which has left even veteran
lawmakers scratching their heads. The rule says that if more than
one measure receives a majority vote, the one with the highest vote
total prevails.
</P>
<P>
   The leading proposal is a companion to a stalled Senate bill
written by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis.
The House version, introduced by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn.,
and Marty Meehan, D-Mass., would ban unlimited contributions to
political parties, known as ``soft money,'' and create restrictions
on independent groups that advertise during campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   However, under the Queen of the Hill rule, if a competing
proposal _ for example, an uncontroversial measure to simply create
a commission to study campaign rules _ receives more votes, it
would trump the Shays-Meehan bill.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, GOP leaders have called for an open debate that
would allow hundreds of amendments (258 have been filed so far) to
the main proposals, without setting aside a continuous chunk of
time to address them.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., called the rules a
``travesty'' that amounted to a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take until 2025 to finish the bill at this rate,''
Gephardt told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their strategy, Republicans plan to introduce a
series of amendments intended to highlight alleged fund-raising
misconduct by the White House and embarrass Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   That's what occurred Thursday, when Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, brought to the floor a proposed constitutional amendment
that would empower Congress to restrict campaign contributions and
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay opposes the amendment, which was submitted more than a
year ago by Gephardt and other Democrats. DeLay brought it to the
floor to highlight potential First Amendment issues involved in
campaign finance legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a debate about free speech,'' said DeLay, who voted
against the measure even though he brought it to the floor. ``This
is a debate about the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the proposed amendment was not ready for passage
and needed the scrutiny of a committee, something that Republicans
have thus far refused to permit.
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected the amendment by a 345-to-29 vote in what may
be the first in a long summer of votes.
</P>
<P>
   There are some optimistic supporters in the House who believe
that a majority may coalesce around the Shays-Meehan bill, or a
bipartisan measure advanced by Tauscher and other freshman members.
However, prospects for passage in the Senate are far bleaker, where
it will require at least eight opponents to change their positions
in order to break an almost-certain filibuster.

ONE DEAD, FIVE INJURED IN MOUNTAIN AVALANCHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE AND KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGMIRE _ An avalanche rumbled down the eastern side of Mount
Rainier Thursday, striking 12 climbers, including one man who died
after dangling from a rope over the edge of an icy cliff.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who was not identified, survived the avalanche but
suffered severe internal injuries in the fall and then was soaked
by icy, melting snow water for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Five other climbers sharing the rope with the dead man were
rescued but suffered injuries ranging from broken bones to
hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   At least two were carried on litters and lowered on ropes down
the mountain to an area called Ingraham Flats, about 400 feet down
the mountain from the avalanche site at 11,400 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers said it was a miracle the five climbers were not more
seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could be considered lucky. They are very fortunate to
have been rescued considering what happened,'' said David Uberuaga,
a spokesman for the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   One survivor, Doug Wagoner, told reporters as he was carried off
the mountain with a broken leg, ``We were just going up the slope
and ice started coming down about the size of a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Another climber, Kent Swanson, told reporters as he was rolled
into the emergency room at Tacoma General Hospital: ``The rescue
group did a fantastic job.''
</P>
<P>
   The rescue helicopter landed at Ingraham Flats and took the five
injured and the dead climber to Madigan Army Hospital in Pierce
County last night.
</P>
<P>
   One survivor was admitted to Madigan, while the rest were sent
to area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The climbers who were not injured were reported to be at Camp
Muir, where climbers gather before trudging up popular routes to
the summit of the 14,411-foot mountain, Uberuaga said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened about 2:30 p.m. as two climbing groups
were descending after reaching the summit. The climbers, who were
from several states, were being escorted by Rainier Mountaineering
Inc., a mountain guide service, Uberuaga said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately known what caused the avalanche but it
may have been set off by a large block of snow and ice that broke
loose without warning, other climbers said.
</P>
<P>
   The slide was most likely a ``point release'' avalanche that
loped along at a jog-like pace, said Phil Ohl, an experienced hiker
who has also ascended Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   But it was powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of this Hollywood movie-type picture of an avalanche,
picture a two- or three-foot section of snow slowly sloughing down
the mountain, pulling in everything in its path,'' Ohl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions were probably pretty good for an avalanche
because it was so warm.'' The man who died on the climbing rope was
at the edge of Disappointment Cleaver, a giant rock outcropping
that separates the Emmons and Ingraham glaciers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called that because it's usually the spot where most
people who can't make it to the top of the mountain turn back,''
said Gus Bush, operations leader for Tacoma Mountain Rescue, which
was sending a dozen volunteer rescuers to the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Each group, made up of six climbers, was roped together when the
avalanche struck. The wife of disabled climber Peter Rieke, who is
ascending the mountain by a vehicle he operates with his arms, saw
a team of climbers falling over the cleaver and called park
officials on her cell phone, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(She) came out of the tent and saw two teams of hikers being
swept away,'' a park spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Park rangers, several professional climbing guides and other
mountain rescue crews _ perhaps at least 20 people _ were involved
in rescue attempts.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening rangers had gotten close enough to see the
climber who eventually died, but they couldn't immediately reach
him.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 8 p.m. Eric Walkinshaw, a spokesman at Mount Rainier
National Park, said: ``He's moving and conscious. A ranger is now
close enough to observe him. But he's in need of help.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the survivors, rescuers were most concerned with a woman
who suffered from severe hypothermia, which can be
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   A rescue team was digging in for the night out of the line of
avalanches, said John Krambrink, the park's chief ranger.
</P>
<P>
   The six climbers who escaped injuries were able to stop their
slide by sticking ice axes in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chinook and Blackhawk helicopters were being used. But
Walkinshaw said low cloud cover was keeping some helicopters away.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche occurred on the Camp Muir-Disappointment Cleaver
route, the shortest and most popular of the routes up the mountain.
At least 10,000 people try to climb the mountain every year; about
half succeed, Walkinshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of climbers were on the mountain Thursday. Most try to
reach the summit early in the morning and return to Camp Muir by
noon.
</P>
<P>
   Rainier is the state's most challenging, and perhaps the most
dangerous, peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense, it's always considered avalanche danger on Mount
Rainier. It's an active glacier. It's always moving. The weather
changes all the time. It's really crumbly rotten rock up there,''
said Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Maria Gillett.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche site is near that of the worst climbing accident
ever at Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people died on June 11, 1981, when they were caught in a
huge icefall at the 11,000-foot level on Ingraham Glacier between
Disappointment Cleaver and Gilbraltar Rock.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 93 climbing deaths on the mountain since 1882.
</P>
<P>
   An accident such as Thursday's is somewhat unusual for this time
of year, when attempts to climb the mountain are usually launched
and the avalanche danger is considered low.
</P>
<P>
   ``By June, the snow is relatively stable,'' said Dan Phillips,
an owner and guide for Cascade Alpine Guides, a Bellevue
mountaineering company who had 12 people reach the summit
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts say recent warm temperatures on the mountain
increased the chances for an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Melting snow makes for favorable avalanche conditions because it
changes the stability of the snow-
</P>
<P>
   pack.
</P>
<P>
   With weekend temperatures in the low 70s _ and more warm weather
Thursday _ parts of Rainier's snowpack had softened significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Warm weather on the mountain _ the summit was bathed in sunlight
and the freezing level was at least 11,000 feet Thursday afternoon
_ made the snow sloppy, Phillips
</P>
<P>
   said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real concern normally isn't avalanches. It's the soft snow
bridges over crevasses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts for the mountain called for temperatures approaching
40 degrees at Camp Muir, which is at the 10,000-foot level.

CLINTON TO EXTEND BAN ON DRILLING UNTIL 2012 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BARNUM and MICHAEL MCCABE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    MONTEREY, Calif. _ President Clinton is expected to cap a
historic conference on the state of the world's oceans Friday by
announcing a 10-year extension of the ban on new offshore oil
drilling, a federal official said Thursday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The planned executive order would be part of a package of
initiatives, including $24 million in increased research funding
that the Clinton administration hopes will boost protection of
oceans and marine life in federal waters.
</P>
<P>
   The existing oil drilling ban, imposed in 1990 by President
Bush, expires in two years, although an Interior Department
five-year management plan would extend that to 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The president's order, to be delivered in a keynote address in a
park at the foot of Cannery Row, would extend the ban until 2012.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision drew varied reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be pleased if the White House extends the
moratorium, period,'' said David Sandretti, spokesman for Sen.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. ``However, we're not going to be satisfied
until we get an act of Congress for a permanent ban.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for California Gov. Pete Wilson, who called
Wednesday for Clinton to sign a permanent ban on drilling off the
coast of California, said the president has not gone far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor believes there should be a permanent ban,'' said
Ron Low, Wilson's deputy press secretary. ``We are puzzled and
dismayed that the president doesn't share this view. The governor
has a long commitment to preserving California's majestic coast,
and it's disappointing that the Clinton administration does not
share it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who came to fog-shrouded Monterey for
the first National Ocean Conference, declined earlier Thursday to
confirm reports of the president's order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned, the president will have announcements (Friday) on
that issue,'' Gore said. ``This is going to be looked back upon ...
as a sea change in our attitude to protecting and saving the
oceans.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the Clinton administration's commitment, Gore
brought gifts of new funds and initiatives to increase research and
improve protections of coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on a Coast Guard pier with sea lions barking in the
background, Gore said the administration would commit $24 million
over three years to map the ocean floor and to improve tracking of
the climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oceans are too often a neglected scientific resource,'' Gore
said after being given a tour of the Western Flyer, a local marine
research vessel. ``We know more about the surface of the moon than
about the ocean floor.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the administration also will spend $6 million to restore
damaged coral reefs, step up attempts to reduce coastal pollution
and declassify sensitive Navy information that could prove useful
for ocean conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, who had called for far more sweeping
measures, were clearly underwhelmed by the funding announcements,
but the initiatives are likely to be only the first installment of
federal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a good start,'' said Julie Packard, executive
director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. ``But the funding is very
minimal, compared to what is needed. It won't go far _ ocean
science is very expensive. What is certainly missing is an
overarching strategy such as long-term funding resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Dreyfus, a spokeswoman for the World Wildlife Fund, said:
``The specific steps announced by the vice president fall short of
what is required to deal effectively with an environmental crisis
of global proportions. To paraphrase a famous hamburger commercial:
`Where's the fish?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have proposed establishing an Ocean
Conservation Investment Fund, using royalties from offshore oil
leases. They say the fund should add a minimum of $200 million a
year to the nation's ocean research budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilson administration, which is miffed at not being given a
larger role in the conference, also scoffed at the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   State Resources Secretary Douglas Wheeler said that although
more research spending is needed, the administration's initiatives
do not address the need for better federal management of ocean
resources. ``There is nothing that would even approach a larger
mandate here, and that's what everyone was looking for,'' said
Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gore, the Clinton administration will undertake the
following initiatives:
</P>
<P>
   -- Commit $12 million over three years to map the ocean floor
within U.S. coastal waters, which extend 200 miles off the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   -- Commit an additional $12 million over three years to place
hundreds of monitoring buoys in the North Atlantic and North
Pacific to be used to improve research on the world climate and
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sign an executive order to expand research and protection of
coral reefs, which are sometimes described as the marine equivalent
of rain forests because they support a stunning diversity of marine
life.
</P>
<P>
   -- As part of the order, the administration is proposing an
additional $6 million through 2002 to complete restoration of 18
damaged reefs in the Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   -- Release previously classified data and technology that was
used by the Navy to hunt submarines. This information can be used
to track whale migrations, improve climate predictions and detect
illegal fishing.
</P>
<P>
   -- Start a new web site (www.epa.gov/ost/beaches) to alert the
public of beach closings, similar to one that is being developed to
alert the public of fish advisories.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving at midmorning, Gore and Rep. Sam Farr,
D-Monterey, who conceived of the conference, were given a tour of
the Western Flyer, a 117-foot high-tech research ship operated by
the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   While aboard the vessel, Gore was in his element, taking the
reins of a remote-control underwater vehicle on the floor of
Monterey Bay and guiding it as it drilled holes, collected samples
and took videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a real thrill for me,'' Gore said. He was accompanied
on the tour by Julie Packard, and Marcia McNutt, director of the
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.

YUGOSLAV ARMY IS MINING ALBANIAN BORDER IN EFFORT TO STOP KOSOVO
REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ The Yugoslav army is seeding the Albanian
border with land mines, apparently in an effort to stop Kosovo
rebels from crossing the border and to prevent the return of
thousands who have been driven from their homes, European military
observers in the area said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic's orders to mine the border, which
stretches for about 75 miles, could also result in a broadening of
the conflict if it leads Kosovo's ethnic Albanian separatists to
resort to using the Macedonian border to bring weapons and fighters
into the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in the presence of armed rebels in western
Macedonia, where the country's Albanian minority lives, could
increase border tensions, induce ethnic Albanians in Macedonia join
the Kosovo Liberation Army in its fight, and eventually draw
Macedonia into the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is once again sowing the seeds of war,'' said a
European military observer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``He wants to solve the conflict in Kosovo militarily and fails to
understand that each time he brings down the hammer, new fires pop
up all around him.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. troops, including American soldiers, are stationed on the
border between Serbia and Macedonia to prevent those countries from
going to war over contested territory.
</P>
<P>
   That mission, NATO planners said, may have to be beefed up to
prevent Macedonia from becoming a staging area for the rebels.
There are reports, Western diplomats said, that the Kosovo
Liberation Army has already used the Macedonian border to smuggle
in fighters and some weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the land mines came from intelligence reports and
witness accounts. They are being planted in an area left vacant by
the shelling of scores of villages and hamlets in Kosovo by
Yugoslav forces. What remained was razed, leaving an unpopulated
swath, and the military observers said planting mines in the area
would insure that it remains a desolate buffer zone between Albania
and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In military terms mining the border region makes sense,'' said
a European military official, who asked not to be identified. ``The
KLA is pouring men and weapons into Kosovo from Albania. If the
zone is emptied of civilians and covered with land mines, this will
impede the movement of the guerrillas and make it harder for the
rebels to use Albania as a sanctuary.''
</P>
<P>
   The mining follows two weeks of a heavy counterinsurgency
campaign by the Serbs to clear an area along the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 80,000 people have been displaced by the fighting,
the destruction of towns and the daily shelling by heavy artillery
pieces mounted on the hills above the border towns.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic appears to want to empty the border town of Djakovica,
where the population of 60,000 has doubled with an influx of ethnic
Albanians displaced from surrounding villages.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have ringed Djakovica with checkpoints and cut phone
communication and most food supplies, according to diplomats who
have visited the area. There has been heavy shelling of the
villages around the city for two days, with large shells slamming
into areas just a mile away from the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the tactic used to empty the other population
centers,'' a European military observer said, ``but Djakovica may
be the final straw. If the Serbs attack Djakovica, they will create
another 120,000 refugees. This may be too much for NATO to
swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict in Kosovo erupted in March when Serbian special
police units moved into central Kosovo in an effort to wipe out the
nascent rebel movement. The initial attack left more than 80 dead,
including children, and pushed the ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province's population of 2 million, to revolt.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army has since mushroomed into a large,
well-armed force. It sends columns of 100 to 200 uniformed fighters
over the Albanian border nearly every night. But the rebel
movement's leadership is poor and its training only rudimentary,
and those problems, coupled with a disastrous strategy of trying to
hold towns against superior Serbian forces, have so far hampered
its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only a matter of time before the rebels begin to operate
as a mobile guerrilla army and bleed a demoralized and dispirited
police and military,'' a European military observer said.
</P>
<P>
   There are reports in the Belgrade press of dismissals of
policemen who have refused to go to Kosovo, desertions and
widespread draft-dodging such as took place during the war in
Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The violence has doomed any hope, for the moment, of a
negotiated solution to the conflict. It has also brought the ethnic
Albanians closer to realizing their goal of a separate state, a
goal most of the outside world rejects.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and European capitals insist that Belgrade grant the
ethnic Albanians autonomy but that the province remain part of
Yugoslavia, now made up of Montenegro and Serbia. Many diplomats
concede, however, that the proposal is probably unworkable given
the intensity of the fighting.

   SHAOSHAN, China _ The adobe house where Mao Tse-tung grew up is
a shrine not just to the father of communist China, but to the
spirit of the peasants who inspired and helped him fight a
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Tan Ruiren's parents were among them, early members of the
Shaoshan peasants' movement that Mao was said to have started in a
small loft of that house in 1925 to help burdened, dirt-poor
peasants shape a new life.
</P>
<P>
   She still proudly shows the photograph of herself and fellow
workers meeting with Chairman Mao when he returned to visit in
1959, after the revolution had put the communists in power.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she was a young mother and the cook of the collective farm
where Mao ate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tan runs her own hectic restaurant across the pond from
Mao's house, where she also sells Mao trinkets and gladly
distributes every day hundreds of copies of that 1959 photo that
has brought her celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Is she rich? Hard to say. But she's done awfully well since
China began loosening strictures of the command economy that Mao
clamped over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Peasants in these idyllic mountain foothills of Hunan Province
are living all right these days, said Zhong Yang, a guide at the
museum and homestead of Mao.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest topic of conversation now is the internet,'' said
Zhong.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late leader Deng Xiaoping started dismantling Mao's
communist economy with reforms leading to division of the land
among farmers, as well as to private commerce and business, these
peasants have snapped up the chance to become entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Cafes and souvenir shops have proliferated in this town that
still attracts 1.3 million tourists a year. Home construction is
booming.
</P>
<P>
   Today's peasants don't look or act much like revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Tan, for example, started selling rice porridge to tourists when
reform filtered to this backwater, then just grew her business.
</P>
<P>
   A silver-haired woman of 70, Tan has fielded so many questions
over these years that she also has become silver-tongued.
</P>
<P>
   With all these changes in China, she was asked one recent
afternoon, how does she see the legacy of Chairman Mao?
</P>
<P>
   ``If people didn't have deep feelings about Chairman Mao they
wouldn't come here,'' she responded. ``If there was no Mao, there
would be no party and no Chinese people. If there was no Mao
Tse-tung thought, there is no Deng Xiaoping theory. Now we combine
the theory and the practice.''

   GUO YUAN, China _ Gazing down over green rice shoots that
forever have been the Chinese peasant's sweaty handhold on life,
Zhan Hanjuin couldn't dismiss the broad grin that had played across
his face all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for him still to believe he was standing atop his
own new, two-story house with a fish pond on the roof, a Volkswagen
Santana in the garage, and a six-foot-high air-conditioner in the
parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Just 25 years ago, Zhan and his new bride shared a house with
his parents, two brothers and their families. They worked on a
collective farm and didn't have electricity, much less electronics
like the television and stereo ornamenting Zhan's year-old house.
</P>
<P>
   Zhan, 48, is a top-of-the-line ``peasant.''
</P>
<P>
   But millions of Chinese families have pulled themselves out of
exhausting poverty since land reform began handing them control of
China's rice paddies and grain fields in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peasants can arrange their work and living schedule on their
own,'' he told a visitor. ``In their spare time they have the
freedom to look for opportunities to earn a lot of money. It's up
to them to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50 million mostly rural Chinese remain overwhelmed by the
deepest poverty, according to government statistics, but that is
dramatically less than the 250 million registered in 1978. Back
then the Zhan family was among the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The grain farmers of northern China accrue less from reform than
farmers in this south-central rice bowl, where tiny plots of land
give lucrative yields. Yet peasants throughout the country are
seeing lifestyle improvements at the very time urban workers are
suffering from growing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   An early summer ride through Hunan Province shows what that
means in the rice paddies patchworking the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliantly verdant landscape is flecked everywhere with
two-story homes faced in the same white, brick-sized tiles that
cover Zhan's house, with the same smoked-glass windows battling the
sun. Some tiled roofs make orange-red splashes on the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Many are additions built onto older adobe or concrete slab
buildings, and many are still under construction. The majority of
peasants in Hunan Province, population 62 million, look to be
living in spacious, if rather basic, comfort.
</P>
<P>
   How to explain this agriculture success story, when the other
giant of collective farms _ Russia _ has been almost totally unable
to retreat from the communist style of communal farm work and
continues to experience a draining slump in output?
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference is that China eliminated collectives and
divided the land among families. Chinese farmers don't have full
ownership, since they cannot sell, develop or lease the land
allotted them. But the crops are theirs to keep or sell. And they
expect their grandchildren to farm the same fields.
</P>
<P>
   Except at a few experimental sites, Russia did not divide its
farm land. So farmers still assume no individual responsibility for
their work, in either success or failure.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the nature of soil and crops make independent
farming more difficult in Russia, and so far the nation and its
farmers have been unwilling even to attempt broad-based farming
outside the village-centered group.
</P>
<P>
   In Hunan Province today, 70 percent of the farmers no longer
live in poverty, said Wu Heqing, a province spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today peasants spend 25 percent of the time they used to
(spend) farming the land,'' said Wu. ``Now they have incentives to
work, because they get everything they grow. And now they can
engage in business in their free time. That used to be
prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the collective system, peasants were paid according to the
number of days they spent in the fields. Working slowly was to
their advantage _ the more days worked, the more compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Now farmers get in and out of the fields at full tilt, so they
can make money working in small factories or running their own
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Guo Yuan Township Vehicle and Parts Factory molded itself
seamlessly to the changes. Employing 43 people when it started
producing small tools and plows in 1971, the enterprise now has 700
to 1,400 workers hammering together bright blue farm trucks
increasingly in demand as agriculture prospers.
</P>
<P>
   The primitive factory lacks conveyors or safety gear, but plant
director Jiang Yitian said the factory rolls out about 10,000
trucks a year. He finds the cyclical nature of farm work compatible
with the up-and-down demand for trucks. Both require part-time
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have orders they come to work. Then when they're free
they go back to the land,'' Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
   His factory hands earn an average of 500 yuan ($60) a month,
about as much as low-end urban workers. This usually supplements a
family's farm income.
</P>
<P>
   It is China's dense, double-crop cultivation of rice that has
enabled farmers here to prosper even with land allotments that seem
incredibly small.
</P>
<P>
   The dirt road leading back to Huang Jianxia's place, for
example, passes a rice paddy so tiny that it looks scarcely big
enough to feed his family a year of dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with three of those small fields called mu -- each mu is
about one-sixth of an acre -- Huang manages harvests totalling more
than four tons of rice every year. Adding the income from the pigs
his wife raises, this becomes another ``peasant'' family that no
longer qualifies for the moniker.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we got only 600 kilograms (1,320 pounds) of rice
for each mu we farmed,'' said Huang, 45.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of seed has improved, machines are available for
land preparation, and chemical fertilizer has replaced the human
and pig manure that farmers used to spread on the paddies, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before it took five or six months to work the fields. Now it
only takes two months,'' Huang said. ``The skills have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Huang also is a carpenter, though he said selling his tables and
doors and beds is harder these days since neighbors buy so cheaply
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his family income averages 1,500 to 1,660 yuan a month,
or about $180 to $200. Though low by Western standards, 1,500 yuan
a month is an enviable wage in China.
</P>
<P>
   Recent government statistics show that even in the biggest
cities only 8 percent of the workers earn 1,500 yuan or more.
Workers at Delphi China's Shanghai factory, for example, average
1,000 yuan a month.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials described Huang's household as about median
income for province farmers, and this tallied with observations
during a two-day visit to the Hunan countryside.
</P>
<P>
   His quarters aren't as lavish as those of the Zhan family, but
Huang, his wife and 16-year-old son enjoy a comfortably large house
with spare furniture, a television, refrigerator, ceiling fan and
perhaps most importantly an electric pump that carries well water
to an indoor standpipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't hold much hope to buy a car, but we do hope to have
more household appliances. And more money in the bank,'' Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhan has done better for two reasons: he has six mu of land in
rice and orchards, double Huang's holdings, and off-season he does
lucrative construction work. His family's income averages 2,500 to
4,200 yuan a month. At the upper end, that equal $508 or nearly
$6,100 annually.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy money. Zhan and his wife do all the farm work now
that their two grown sons no longer live at home, but the farmer
said he still has plenty of energy to do construction engineering
in the city between crop demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sure that if the world will stay peaceful,'' Zhan said,
``the life of peasants will become better and better.''

   KRASNOYARSK, Russia _ In the world of lonely hearts, Tatyana
Denoshova's lament rings loud and often.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to meet a real man here. Good men are already
married and if they are not already married, they are no good,''
said the dark-eyed Denoshova, 25, on her inability to find a
suitable mate.
</P>
<P>
   But in her case, the desperation resonates with urgency.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital nurse in this depressed Siberia city 2,000 miles east
of Moscow, Denoshova earns only $40 a month and hasn't been paid
since March. She says the men she meets are similarly strapped, or
sodden with vodka, or both.
</P>
<P>
   She and thousands of other Russian women have turned to catalog,
video and Internet-based matchmaking services seeking husbands _
preferably American or European men who will love them and take
them far away from the dead-end of today's Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic turmoil following the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991 and the ever-expanding World Wide Web have conspired
to make matchmaking a multimillion-dollar industry. Scores of
services also offer similar introductions to women from Asia and
Latin America as potential brides to men in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my clients would prefer an American husband. Times in
our country are very bad and everyone wants a better life,'' said
Nina Kuzmena, a marriage broker in Krasnoyarsk who charges her
clients $20 each to shoot a video in her small living room.
</P>
<P>
   In cosmopolitan Moscow, the same rationale prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Vishnitsev, 31, an accomplished artist, has been searching
for three years through an Internet-based service, Vetsa-Fortune,
which catalogs hundreds of young women searching for husbands.
</P>
<P>
   The agency charges $40 per female client for an unlimited
listing in their published catalog and on the Internet. Men are
charged $50 for each introduction they request after scrutinizing
the catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Vishnitsev's quest hasn't been easy. She divorced her Russian
husband in 1993 when his drinking became chronic. Trying to meet
men in bars or other public places is potentially dangerous and
demeaning, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the introductions via the service, while safer, also can be
degrading.
</P>
<P>
   Often, American and Russian services team up to hold Moscow
``socials'' where hordes of women gather at a Moscow disco to meet
a handful of American men who have paid thousands of dollars each
for a tour package to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition among women in my age group is very
difficult,'' she said. ``These meetings are terribly unpleasant.
You feel like you are for sale at a slave market.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says, the agency ``gives hope to lonely women'' and
has brought her a number of near misses, though she's still looking
for Mr. Right.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet search via Yahoo.com produced 65 separate companies
offering to match American men and Russian women, listing thousands
of personal ads and color photos of women. Some offer a search
function, allowing men to specify age-range, hair color and height
_ and even body measurements _ among the galaxy of women being
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the listings from Russia is Olga, a 23-year-old
English teacher from the northern city of Severodvinsk: ``I seek an
American or Canadian who is well-educated, thoughtful, and
passionate. I want to find someone special from another part of the
world who might value the importance of family values.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage agencies stress that Russian women are eager
homemakers, yet also well-educated and poised. The sales pitch
plays on a sad Russian reality of soaring alcoholism and
unemployment rates among men, often leaving women as the sole
providers and caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They possess a strength of spirit combined with a delicate
femininity that sets them apart from the so-called `liberated'
women in the West,'' says the Web ad for the Svetlana Agency of St.
Petersburg, Russia's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be surprised to know that these highly educated and
charming women have housekeeping and cooking as their favorite
hobbies,'' says another company, European Introductions.
</P>
<P>
   Another is more blunt: ``Russian ladies are not destroyed by
feminism,'' a headline blares in one ad.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of this generally unregulated international industry
prompted the U.S. Congress to pass a 1996 law that requires
matchmaking companies to give information about marriage fraud,
legal residency and domestic violence to women they recruit or risk
fines up to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which estimated that 2,000 to 3,500 American
men find wives through such agencies every year, was prompted in
part by news accounts of cases of immigration fraud and sexual
offenses associated with such matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a small number of fraudulent, abusive, or
sex-oriented marriages that occur. These are, of course, good
stories, and as such are the only stories that end up in the papers
usually,'' said Beau Brummel, an American software developer who
found his wife Tania through a matchmaking service in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Brummel, 31, who was living in rural North Carolina, said he
chose to search Russia for a wife because ``it was easier to review
the Russian women interested in Western men from my computer, and
correspond with them, than it was to be out all night dealing with
drunks and such, here in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the women he met tended to be ``barely high-school
educated, usually overweight, and had no interest in or idea about
any of the things that were part of my professional life or
personal hobbies.''
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, he ordered the addresses of 10 Russian women
and sent them letters. Only three wrote back, one of them his
wife-to-be. They corresponded for about four months until he
traveled to Russia and spent a few weeks with her and her family.
</P>
<P>
   They were married last August and now live in Portland, Oregon,
with her eight-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, his
six-year-old son and their baby Jessica, born in April.
</P>
<P>
   However, such success stories are few given the large numbers of
Russian women looking for mates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with very lonely people in this business who
have unrealistic expectations. American men come here and want a
Barbie doll, a slim blonde without children and a woman much, much
younger than they are. Some younger Russian women want the jackpot,
too. A man who's going to sweep them away to the mansion in
America,'' said Nina Rubasheva, a co-owner of the Vesta-Fortune
agency in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But in faraway Krasnoyarsk, a music teacher and divorced mother
of one, Ludmilla Karielina, 37, is realistic. She has braced
herself for a life alone, despite the hopes she has placed in a
matchmaking service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to be alone,'' she said, ``than to be with a man
who is bad.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American presidents don't often journey to the
world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, will see more of the developing
world this year than the most intrepid collegiate backpacker, with
no fewer than five major forays completed or planned into Africa,
Latin America, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent and China,
where he goes later this month.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he brushes the dust of antiquity off his traveling
shoes at year's end, Clinton will have logged more than 70,000
miles on Air Force One to touch table with countries taking in some
3 billion people _ more than half of whom scrape by on a dollar a
day or less _ who spring from some of the oldest civilizations on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   There's far more to the presidential wanderlust, however, than
ruminations on the past or alms for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton's travels signal are the beginnings of an epic
realignment in U.S. relations with the developing world, whose
fortunes have become tied to the goals of U.S. policymakers and
corporate chiefs like never before.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly much of the change is being driven by commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The United States did a staggering $2 trillion worth of two-way
trade with the rest of the world last year. A large and growing
chunk of that was with developing countries, where hundreds of
American companies have wagered scores of billions of dollars on
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in human history, living standards for huge
populations have quadrupled or more in a single generation,''
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told a meeting of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) here last week. ``This is good
for many people _ and good for the size of the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Far beyond the shift from aid to trade, however, the new
partnership between the United States and many of the world's
poorest nations is being shaped by sobering geo-strategic
realities.
</P>
<P>
   For whether the issue is the scourge of drugs or the roots of
war, the threat of terrorism or the spread of AIDS, the wealth of
nations, global environmental protection or the harrowing specter
of nuclear Armageddon, it is becoming increasingly clear that the
United States can no longer control its own destiny _ much less
events beyond its borders _ solely in concert with its traditional
allies among the world's wealthy, democratic nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get real cooperation from countries that are not
in that privileged club, we're not going to have a dramatic
impact,'' said Antony Blinken(CQ), senior director for strategic
planning at the White House National Security Council. ``As
powerful as we are, we just don't run the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was rudely reminded of that just last week, when he went
to the United Nations to plead with Mexico and its neighbors to
stop ``pointing fingers'' at the United States in the pitched
diplomatic dispute over how best to combat the illicit narcotics
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Setting aside the public tiff, the White House readily concedes
that it needs Mexico's help in combating illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't buy into the process of trying to solve this
problem,'' said Blinken, ``we can't do it on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom have the limits of U.S. influence been more vividly
displayed than they were on June 3. In the sun-dappled splendor of
the White House Rose Garden, President Clinton formally dispatched
his top diplomat to Geneva to huddle with her counterparts from
Britain, China, Russia and France over how best to staunch a
mounting nuclear arms race between Pakistan and India, both of
which repeatedly tested nuclear weapons this spring over Clinton's
fervent objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do my very best for the president and the American
people,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright dutifully pledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``But do not make a mistake,'' she warned darkly. ``The risks of
the moment are high, and, for the moment, the key choices will be
made in New Delhi and Islamabad. We must all hope and pray those
choices are the right ones.''
</P>
<P>
   As necessity bears invention, so has nuclear saber-rattling
forced U.S. policymakers to finally take seriously a conflict that
has burned for decades in the disputed province of Kashmir, where
thousands of Indians and Pakistanis have been killed in gnawing
sectarian violence that has pushed the two countries toward the
brink of apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must begin to focus on the heart of the India-Pakistan
conflict _ Kashmir,'' an invigorated Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.,
cautioned earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not only talking about the fate of a disputed state in
the Himalayas,'' said Brownback, chairman of the Near Eastern and
South Asian Affairs Subcommittee, ``we're talking about the
national security interests of the United Sates and its allies and,
indeed, the rest of the world in averting war.''
</P>
<P>
   If the nuclear threat tends to focus policymakers, recent
conventional conflicts in places like Rwanda, Somalia, Haiti and
Bosnia have already proven the dangers that regional animosities
pose to the major powers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union loosed the Cold War
structures that framed the world for half a century, it has been
the troubles of such lesser states, far more than the jousting of
geopolitical giants, that have disrupted the post Cold War peace.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend many analysts expect to persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary security concerns are going to be in the
developing countries, and the U.S. has to realign its strategic
thinking,'' said John Echeverri-Gent, professor of international
political economy at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.
``Not only will that mean new military strategy, but, hopefully, it
means new diplomatic strategy as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Development experts like Echeverri-Gent, naturally enough, have
been proselytizing for decades about the need to take seriously the
interests of the world's pitiably poor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, it's technology, markets and realpolitik, not
altruism, that have linked the interests of wealthy nations
inextricably with those of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sharp turnaround from decades of neo-colonialism, when
U.S. policymakers contented themselves with treating much of the
developing world primarily as a source of cheap raw materials and
labor, an emerging market for American goods and services or as a
chessboard for playing out the geopolitical stakes of the major
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, in the world of the Internet A-bomb and sarin gas; a
place where an AIDS epidemic in Uganda is just a plane flight away
from New York; where dollar-an-hour workers in a Juarez suburb
compete head on with the breadwinner of a family in St. Louis;
where a crack addict on the streets of Chicago can feed a ravenous
crime ring in Colombia; and where missile parts shipped from China
can enable Pakistan to target India with a nuclear bomb; the
developing world's prospects, for better and for worse, pose real
and immediate challenges for the United States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things that have zero respect for borders,'' said
Blinken. ``A problem that starts at one end of the global village
can become a plague on everyone's house much more quickly than
before, so it requires us to work more closely with these people
than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One helps. And yet, presidential visits are only the
visible tip of the enormous working-level activity such engagement
spawns between countries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip to China, for instance _ the first such visit by
a sitting American president since Beijing's bloody crackdown nine
years ago on democracy advocates near Tiananmen Square _ only
symbolizes his broader policy of working with, rather than
isolating, Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   He buttressed that approach on June 3 by renewing China's most
favored nation (MFN) trading status, over the objections of many on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the controversial step, Clinton praised China's
efforts to help defuse the nuclear crisis between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is further evidence of the important role China can play
in meeting the challenges of the 21st Century,'' said Clinton.
``This is an important example of how our engagement with China
serves America's interests _ stability in Asia, preventing the
spread of weapons of mass destruction, combating international
crime and drug trafficking, protecting the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ringing endorsement conveniently overlooked the vital
role China played in assisting Pakistan's nuclear weapons quest.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point to Clinton's China policy as an example of U.S.
foreign policy toward developing nations being dominated by the
interests of U.S. companies, which have invested $17.3 billion in
China to date and have signed contracts to invest $23 billion more.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. relations with much of the developing world were held
hostage by Cold War concerns, so today, critics allege, is U.S.
policy toward poorer countries largely a captive of the Fortune
500.
</P>
<P>
   In search of cheap labor and growing markets, American
companies, abetted by Washington, are shaking hands and cutting
deals with some of the most repressive regimes anywhere on Earth _
Vietnam, Indonesia, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia among them.
</P>
<P>
   The White House counters that liberal thought and democracy will
naturally flow from open markets and the resultant rise of a middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't yet worked in China, where markets have been opening
for two decades, the middle class now tops 150 million and the
political system remains one of the most harshly repressive
anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this view in the political world, and the academic
world, that all one needs to do is open up commercial relations and
favorable political relations will follow in the wake,'' said
Jeffrey Winters, professor of political economy at Northwestern
University in Evanston, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that democratization comes when
people struggle for it,'' said Winters. ``The markets don't do this
automatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Winters said he would prefer to see the White House impose harsh
economic sanctions on countries that don't move in the direction of
democratization and respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has imposed sanctions on a long list of
developing countries, including Libya, Iran, Iraq and, most
recently, Pakistan and India. In each case, though, it has been
security concerns, not human rights violations, that have prompted
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, said the National Security Council's
Blinken, it is by working with developing countries, far more than
by trying to squeeze them, that U.S. influence will ultimately be
leveraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of these countries there is a tide of history that's
moving very, very hard against dictatorship or repressive leaders
that don't fulfill the rights or demands of their people,'' said
Blinken. ``What we can do is try to get things to move in the right
direction.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American presidents don't often journey to the
world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, will see more of the developing
world this year than the most intrepid collegiate backpacker, with
no fewer than five major forays completed or planned into Africa,
Latin America, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent and China,
where he goes later this month.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he brushes the dust of antiquity off his traveling
shoes at year's end, Clinton will have logged more than 70,000
miles on Air Force One to touch table with countries taking in some
3 billion people _ more than half of whom scrape by on a dollar a
day or less _ who spring from some of the oldest civilizations on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   There's far more to the presidential wanderlust, however, than
ruminations on the past or alms for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton's travels signal are the beginnings of an epic
realignment in U.S. relations with the developing world, whose
fortunes have become tied to the goals of U.S. policymakers and
corporate chiefs like never before.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly much of the change is being driven by commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The United States did a staggering $2 trillion worth of two-way
trade with the rest of the world last year. A large and growing
chunk of that was with developing countries, where hundreds of
American companies have wagered scores of billions of dollars on
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in human history, living standards for huge
populations have quadrupled or more in a single generation,''
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told a meeting of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) here last week. ``This is good
for many people _ and good for the size of the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Far beyond the shift from aid to trade, however, the new
partnership between the United States and many of the world's
poorest nations is being shaped by sobering geo-strategic
realities.
</P>
<P>
   For whether the issue is the scourge of drugs or the roots of
war, the threat of terrorism or the spread of AIDS, the wealth of
nations, global environmental protection or the harrowing specter
of nuclear Armageddon, it is becoming increasingly clear that the
United States can no longer control its own destiny _ much less
events beyond its borders _ solely in concert with its traditional
allies among the world's wealthy, democratic nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get real cooperation from countries that are not
in that privileged club, we're not going to have a dramatic
impact,'' said Antony Blinken(CQ), senior director for strategic
planning at the White House National Security Council. ``As
powerful as we are, we just don't run the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was rudely reminded of that just last week, when he went

trade.

CELEBRATING THE END OF THE FIRST GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday June 18)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We brought chips to the end-of-the-year party at my son's
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   First-graders, apparently, are a munchy lot, as evidenced by the
list of party supplies the teacher requested: cake, pretzels,
candy, fruit, cookies, juice.
</P>
<P>
   But they're also a delightful age, bridging that 7- to
8-year-old divide like miniature Lewis and Clarks, headed west to
explore uncharted territory.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Erik Erikson calls it the latency stage in
development, where children are learning ``the relationship between
perseverance and the pleasure of a job completed.'' Children in
elementary school, he found, have a need to be productive and to do
work on their own.
</P>
<P>
   First-graders are mastering abstract thought, and are able to go
beyond the here and now to think about concepts like ``forever,''
``justice,'' and ``love.''
</P>
<P>
   I just enjoy the conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know why people get married ... because they want someone to
play with,'' Adam says. ``But does there have to be a wedding? And
do you have to kiss in front of all those people? I would be
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``What if you never existed? You wouldn't know that you
didn't exist. There would just be NOTHING, you wouldn't have ever
been here at all, but I wonder what it would feel like, to not
exist? How does nothing feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``OK, so babies come from seeds and eggs, but how do those
seeds get into those eggs, that's what I want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as we feel like ducking and running for cover during
Adam's heavy question artillery fire, his dad and I stand our
ground and have surprised ourselves by coming up with fairly decent
answers.
</P>
<P>
   But every once in a while _ sometimes the temptation is too
great, even as parents _ we have some fun with young,
impressionable minds.
</P>
<P>
   Take the first-grade party.
</P>
<P>
   My husband showed up straight from the airport, back just in
time from a business trip to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The first-graders gathered around, since Jim had been a big hit
at the teach-in a few months back by demonstrating a few simple
magic tricks. (That's another great thing about first-graders. A
few simple magic tricks are all you need to be cool.)
</P>
<P>
   Johnny, one of my son's best friends in class, asked if he could
come over and play after the class party.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' said Jim, joking with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have $7,'' said Johnny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, in that case, sure,'' Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   The other kids stared in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to pay to go to Adam's house?'' one asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' said Jim. ``There's video rental fees, snacks...''
</P>
<P>
   ``You make kids rent your video games?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a bidding war was under way. ``I have $3.'' ``I can get $5
from my brother ....''
</P>
<P>
   Adam was pretty sure this was all a joke. But he still reveled
in having instantly turned into such a hot commodity.
</P>
<P>
   After the kids had their fill of snacks, they gathered their
pencil cases, stubby crayons, treat bags, folders filled with
artwork taken down from the walls, and a few leftover math and
spelling worksheets.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Adams called her students up and said goodbye to each in
turn, giving them a hug.
</P>
<P>
   And Johnny came over to play, free, for the rest of the
afternoon.

 &HT;    Plain talk, plain sense
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have good news from Washington for a change. President
Clinton and his cardboard sidekick, Al Gore, have ordered
government bureaucrats to stop writing gobbledygook and use plain
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plain language saves the government and private sector time,
effort and money,'' the president explained.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore will be point man in the Plain English
campaign. This is because of his experience in making speeches on
kindergarten level. A typical Gore mouthful is ``see Jane run,'' or
``see Dick jump.'' Al Gore's lectures are easy to follow, if you
can stay awake.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, rambling government sentences will be short and
to the point. ``Short is better than long,'' says Gore. ``Active is
better than passive. Clarity helps advance understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good start, but they're still wasting words and space.
How about: ``Short beats long. Active beats passive. Clarity helps
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Plain English will be helpful when we start to file income tax
forms. We won't have to worry about lines 9 and 5 and all the stuff
even H&AMP;R Block can't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Instructions for paying income tax will be simple:
</P>
<P>
   1. Go to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   2. Withdraw all your money.
</P>
<P>
   3. Send it to the government.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have at least half a year's earnings in the bank
you can:
</P>
<P>
   a. Sell your car.
</P>
<P>
   b. Sell your home.
</P>
<P>
   c. Get a night job.
</P>
<P>
   d. Make your spouse go to work.
</P>
<P>
   e. Sell your vital organs.
</P>
<P>
   Another battle ahead
</P>
<P>
   Although it will cost around $56 million, plain talk is expected
to save billions in the long run. The bad news is just as we get
one problem solved we run into another that's threatening to
destroy the economy, along with our sanity. That's voice mail and
automated telephone directories.
</P>
<P>
   Where I live we have to get government permission to strike a
match. About half the year we have a burning ban, applying to
leaves, limbs, candy wrappers and, in many places, cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   I had a small pile of tree leaves and several candy wrappers I
needed to burn before the summer burning ban went into effect last
month. In order to stay out of jail and avoid fines, I had to call
the county fire department to get permission to burn a small trash
pile in my back yard.
</P>
<P>
   I looked in the phone book for the number of the fire
department, non-emergencies. I dialed the number. I didn't get the
fire department, non-emergencies. I got a recorded voice: ``You
have reached the Fayette County Administrative Complex. If you wish
to speak to the health department, dial 415; if you wish to speak
to the building department, dial something else, if you wish to
speak to the county agent or extension service, etc., etc.''
</P>
<P>
   The electronic voice droned through a half dozen departments but
never got to the fire department. ``For recorded information, dial
500; otherwise remain on the line for assistance,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to remain on the line for assistance. Another
electronic voice informed me that everyone in the county
administrative office was busy and I'd have to wait. After a
lengthy wait I decided everyone at the county administrative office
was going to be busy until the end of the week when it would be too
late to get a burning permit. I dialed back to ``recorded
information.''
</P>
<P>
   After several tries I made a connection with a fire department
recording. I got an electronic lecture on fire safety. I got
precise measurements required for a legal trash pile. By the time I
got permission to strike a match to it, I was ready to stuff
everything into plastic garbage bags and throw my trash on the side
of the road like some people do.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the government. Have you tried to call your bank
lately?
</P>
<P>
   I had a simple account question. I looked in the local phone
book, got the local number of my local bank, and dialed. An
electronic voice, obviously located in some other state, or
country, began listing options: home loans, corporate offices,
automobile loans, investments, etc. A laundry list of things that
had nothing to do with what I needed to know.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 minutes of punching on my telephone, listening to
electronic options, and a disconnect, I finally got to customer
service, and eventually to a live human being. I told the live
human who I wanted to speak with at my local bank. ``Let me see if
I can locate her,'' he said. I could hear clicking on computer keys
as he searched files. After several minutes the clicking stopped.
``She's in the Miami office,'' the voice said. ``You'll have to
call her there.''
</P>
<P>
   I hung up the phone and drove to the bank.

 &HT;    Talk horse sense or whisper to a winner on equine farm tour
 &HT;    By Mary Thurwachter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCALA, Fla. _ I went to Farnsworth Farms to visit some old
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the equine kind. Ones that I had seen when they had
run at Gulfstream or Calder racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   I hoped to get close enough to do some horse whispering _ I
wanted to thank Mecke, a Florida racing legend who once won me
enough cash to buy a CD player.
</P>
<P>
   Mecke, who has since moved to Ocala Stud, never got close enough
to hear a whisper that day, but I got a chance to shout out a few
kind words when he came within 10 feet of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   When you drive through this part of the state, with its rolling
hills, classic farm country board fencing and ancient oaks veiled
in Spanish moss, you'll be tempted to roll down the windows and
breathe in the beauty. And you'll want to visit a horse farm. If
you're lucky, you'll encounter greatness of the four-legged kind.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Kentucky Derby winner, Silver Charm, was foaled in
this area and this year's Derby champ, Real Quiet, was trained
here. Triple Crown winner Affirmed (1978) was bred and raised here,
too. It's no wonder folks call this the ``Lexington of the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's horse industry has been at home here since the 1930s.
Ocala and Marion County boast more than 400 thoroughbred farms, and
an additional 300 farms that raise Appaloosas, Paso Finos, paints,
miniatures and quarter horses.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief visit to Ocala, a friend and I toured the
500-acre Farnsworth Farms, owned by Mike Sherman, on Highway 326
west of Interstate 75.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Mecke, we visited a few of the horses that were
still in the barn, some in air-conditioned stalls. Each one, we
learned, has a distinct personality.
</P>
<P>
   Jeblar knocked his hoof against the barn gate, anxious to run
free in the green pastures.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Leon was a royal clown. He made faces, exposing every giant
tooth in his mouth and raising his snoot toward the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Our visit was very informal and the grooms, who were cleaning
the barn as we arrived, seemed to enjoy talking about the horses as
much as we loved seeing them.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when we go to the racetrack, we pay special
attention to horses sired by any of the legends we spent a morning
with at Farnsworth. And it's a sure bet we'll return to visit more
of Ocala's equine celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other farms open to visitors by appointment. Admission
is free. You can pick up a list of farms at the Ocala Chamber of
Commerce, 110 E. Silver Springs Blvd. in downtown Ocala, or call
the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders' and Owners' Association (352)

<P>
   Sweat index: Think you need to be a rough rider to do a horse
tour? Neigh! Just call one of the tour operators listed below and
let them do the work or hop in the car and drive to the farms
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Fun fact: Horse breeding began in the Ocala area in the late
1950s with the discovery that the area's nutrient-fortified grass
aided strong equine bone development. The grass is the product of
the limestone-rich Florida Aquifer, which stretches across Marion
County.
</P>
<P>
   Directions: From West Palm Beach, Ocala is a three-hour drive
north on the Turnpike to Interstate-75. To get to Farnsworth Farms

County Road 326. Continue for 2 1/2 miles to Farnsworth Farms.
Visiting hours are from 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Phone: (352) 622-5551.

 &HT;    STEAL AWAY FROM DISNEY AND DROP BY SOUTHERN LIVING'S IDEA HOUSE
 &HT;    By AVA VAN de WATER
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Sometimes it's the little, less obvious things
that are most interesting in a house. Like the Honeywell vacuum pan
in the kitchen floor of Southern Living's Idea House in
Celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Sweep your crumbs into a pile, tap the switch with your foot and
_ swoosh _ crumbs are sucked into the wall. It's the '90s way to
sweep dirt under the rug.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the crumbs really go into a central vacuum system, but it
is the neatest, most useful conversation piece I've ever seen. Just
don't turn it on if the cat's snoozing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in the market for new decorating or home building
ideas, hop in your car and head for Celebration, Disney's
neo-traditional town just south of Orlando. That's where Southern
Living magazine's latest Idea House just opened (and will remain
open through the end of January).
</P>
<P>
   With easy-to-live-with fabrics, comfy furniture and a soothing
color scheme of cream, sage green, and bricky terra cotta, the
house has a relaxed, comfortable feeling that still evokes gracious
living.
</P>
<P>
   And there are a heck of a lot of places to relax in this house.
There's a den, garden parlor, family room and covered patio
downstairs; a private guest apartment above the garage; and a
master retreat on the third floor _ above the master suite.
</P>
<P>
   There's a computer nook with window seat for the kids, a mudroom
for the kids' stuff, and potting room for the garden enthusiast. In
addition to the two-car garage for vehicles, there's a one-car,
detached garage that's just as easy to envision as a home office,
artist's studio or rec room with pool table.
</P>
<P>
   There is the rather odd fact that you walk into the dining room
from the front porch, but, first impressions aside, there are
plenty of good ideas in this house. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ A nursery doesn't have to be cutesy to be cute. There are no
fussy kids' fabrics or juvenile wallpaper borders. Instead, there
is a Matisse-looking painting of a pot of flowers above the crib,
and whimsical watercolors of teapots and shoes in a bold,
MacKenzie-Childs style. The drapery fabric, which coordinates with
plaid crib set, is a quiet print of nursery rhyme characters, and
walls are a creamy beige, with white christening gowns hung high _
out of a little girl's reach. The washed pine furniture from
Lexington _ a dresser, rocking chair and shelves to display baby
photos and memorabilia _ can go all the way through college,
providing she doesn't spill nail polish on it as a pre-teen.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: If you go, be sure to look up _ criss-crossed ribbons with
bows on the nursery ceiling create an interesting lattice pattern.
It's simple to do, but the bows take time to make. Mary McWilliams,
Southern Living's interior design director, wanted to give the
ceiling extra interest because it's one of the first things you see
as you reach the top of the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Challenging architecture can be overcome. We all, sooner or
later, encounter a room with too many openings. Such is the case
with the garden parlor. The roughly 15- by 14-foot room between the
foyer and kitchen, has six openings _ French doors to the courtyard
patio, two doors into the kitchen, the passage from the front
entry, a door to the study, and the side entry door. That was a
challenge to the decorating team, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   The solution? ``You float the furniture the best you can in the
middle of the room,'' said interior designer Marnie Sorensen of
Godfrey &AMP; Associates in Winter Park.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the room, they placed an ottoman between a love
seat and two chairs. Then, to jazz it up a bit, they mixed fabrics
on the love seat, and added beadboard to the walls, giving it a
faux finish. ``When you have a room that's divided up like that,
you have to do something to make it interesting,'' Sorensen said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expand your living space outdoors. A walled-in courtyard has a
soothing fountain and a covered patio for alfresco dining. Don't
miss the potting room with sink plus storage for compost, potting
soil and fertilizer. It can double as a wet bar for parties on the
patio, thanks to a pass-through window above the sink.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: Homeowners can create their own potting shed by adding a
lean-to at the side of the house. Or, buy an outdoor workbench from
a store such as Target, and put a couple cans beneath it to hold
compost, Sorensen said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget to accessorize the kitchen. The kitchen is the
nerve center of the house _ the place we start and end the day. So
make room for personal family photos and prop small pieces of art
on the backsplash or open shelves. But don't clutter up the tops of
the cabinets, McWilliams warns.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: The kitchen's Armstrong vinyl floor looks like pink slate,
but is easier on feet _ and dropped items _ than tile.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get the computer out of the bedroom. If you have the space,
create a computer nook for the kids. This one has seating for two
at the desk, with plenty of storage for books, games and computer
software, freeing up the bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: A rope secured to a wall by teacup hooks is the perfect
place for kids to hang their artwork with clothespins. (The
children can paint the clothespins if they want.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Reflect children's interests when accessorizing their rooms.
Shelves with pegs beneath hang above twin beds in the boys' room,
giving them space to display trophies and favorite things.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: Even window valences can showcase an interest. At the Idea
House, simple window valances are topped with baseball finials
``aged'' with Old English oil.
</P>
<P>
   _ Accessorize the bath for children, but make the fixtures
timeless. Simple cream cabinets and gold door pulls are teamed with
hand-painted stool and accessories geared to kids. And cream, sage
and white tiles that blend with the rest of the house color scheme
won't be outgrown.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: Add interest to a flat bathroom mirror by ``framing'' it
with molding. Use baseboard molding or casing from Home Depot _
just miter the corners and give it a coat of paint.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clean up the master bedroom. Ever wonder why master bedrooms
look so spacious in decorating magazines? There are no dressers to
clutter the room. Built-in cabinets in huge walk-in closets are one
alternative; or, if you're lucky enough to have the space, in the
master dressing area.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: Don't miss the master breakfast bar, with GE
refrigerator/ice maker, sink and cupboard for cups, glasses and
teapot. It's a luxury more and more new homes are including.
</P>
<P>
   _ You don't have to have a sofa and TV in the den. This
14-by-12-foot den off the front entry has four, plump leather
chairs and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: McWilliams hopes those going to the Ideas House will be
inspired by the little touches _ such as the pictures hanging on
the front of the bookshelves. ``I could have filled those bookcases
with just books, but when you do that, you lose the opportunity for
art pieces and accessories,'' McWilliams said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add architectural elements without breaking the bank. The
family room, off the kitchen, features heart pine paneling above
the mantle. It adds architectural interest but is less expensive
than paneling the entire room.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: The sofa is upholstered in chenille fabric _ comfortable
enough to cuddle up in while watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add storage near the family entry. A mudroom by the garage has
a bench for pulling off muddy shoes, and pegs for storing baseball
gloves, backpacks and rain gear.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: Note the mudroom floor _ you don't have to scrimp in small
spaces. The limestone was cut against the grain to emphasize its
texture.
</P>
<P>
   _ And the best idea of all _ a guest apartment. Good for
in-laws, nannies, and guests, this mini-apartment includes a
bathroom, bedroom/living room and kitchen with microwave, oven,
sink, refrigerator and stacked washer/dryer. Everything to give
them _ and you _ a little privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: It's so nice, guests may overstay their welcome.

   LAKE WALES _ I have a bicycle, and minutes into my 28-mile ride
in Lake Wales, I thought that I might regret it.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th tractor-trailer rocketed by, seemingly inches away, its
backwash yanking me from the right edge of the white stripe that I
was desperately trying to keep beneath my wheels. This might be the
way the world ends for me, I thought. The fate of so many love bugs
on the grills of trucks might also be mine.
</P>
<P>
   My hands were locked in a death grip around the handlebars. I
wanted to turn around, get in my car and drive on four wheels back
to West Palm Beach. I had been warned by a friend who had cycled in
Polk County that the traffic was fast and the roads were narrow.
</P>
<P>
   But two miles and a right turn later I was alone on Alternate
U.S. 27, a rolling two-lane road, happily pedaling through orderly
lines of orange trees and bright green fields scattered with
grazing cattle. The thundering whooshes of traffic were replaced by
the quiet roar of the wind in my ears, the cicada's buzz and the
low purr of spinning bicycle wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Today I was going to live.
</P>
<P>
   Polk County, southwest of Orlando, is in the shadow of Disney
World. It has no theme parks, but it does have miles of open roads.
Promoting their county as bicycle-friendly, tourism officials have
created a nifty package of maps and information for cyclists. It is
an inventive effort to attract visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The maps have plotted trips and color-coded streets showing road
widths and traffic volume. The routes, all loops, vary from 20 to
100 miles and are generally sparsely traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the roads are in the country, where I found a mix of
shaded lanes lined with moss-draped trees, shallow hills and wide
open spaces of citrus groves and pastures. I often rode miles at a
time without seeing a car, allowing for long moments of quiet
reflection.
</P>
<P>
   The routes also go through small towns, down wide, tidy
neighborhood streets and past businesses such as fruit-picking bag
manufacturers, drive shaft repair shops, feed stores and fertilizer
plants.
</P>
<P>
   I cycled four of the six marked routes during my three-day stay.
I rode 20 miles in Lakeland, 28 miles in Lake Wales, 38 miles in
Winter Haven and the 62 mile Auburndale loop. My favorite was the
Winter Haven ride, which runs along many lakes and has long
stretches of roads canopied by live oaks. My least favorite was the
Lakeland route, which had portions under repair and a road over
Interstate 4 with on and off ramps with very heavy traffic.
</P>
<P>
   These trips, particularly the longer ones, are best suited for
lightweight road bikes with narrow tires, which provide less
resistance and make for an easier ride. If you plan to try it on a
mountain bike, stick to the shorter routes unless you are sure of
your fitness level.
</P>
<P>
   My companion for this trip was a Colnago, an Italian racing
bike.
</P>
<P>
   There are several bed and breakfasts (you will want a big,
protein-rich breakfast) in Lake Wales. I stayed at Noah's Ark, a
place named after Noah Holton, who owns it with his wife, Louise.
It is decorated with antique furniture and has very accommodating
hosts. It is large enough to fit two of every type of animal, like
the original ark, as well as several bicycles, which are allowed
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the routes can be ridden from Noah's Ark and the others
are a short car ride away.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from my inn were two attractions, Bok Tower Gardens and
Spook Hill. The 205-foot-tall Bok Tower is in the middle of a huge,
beautifully landscaped garden. It houses a carillon, an instrument
of 57 bronze bells. Visit Bok near the end of a ride _ you will
leave too relaxed to be of much use on a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Spook Hill is an incline where it is claimed that gravity is
defied and a vehicle will coast uphill. The sign says to stop on a
marked line, put your car in neutral. You'll roll back, but it will
seem like you're rolling uphill. I pulled up with my bike to the
foot of the hill, pointing up, lifted my feet and I rolled
backward. But it seemed like I was rolling down the hill. No
spooking for me.
</P>
<P>
   On a remote section of the 62-mile Auburndale trip, I had ridden
for many thirsty miles with one last rationed swig of water in my
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding a corner on Old Polk City Road, an oasis emerged in the
form of an old packing house with a glass-paneled refrigerator
stocked with ice cold fresh-squeezed orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   I bought a quart and gulped it. For a moment I felt that I
wouldn't have to stop when the loop was finished back near Lake
Alfred, that I could stay on my bike and pedal forever.
</P>
<P>
   travel, 9i travel, 9i travel, 9i
</P>
<P>
   Sweat index: You have to have nerves _ and thighs _ of steel to
ride the white line on some of these roads. Your competition is
18-wheelers. The rides are for the serious cyclist.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation: Most of the roads are in remote areas, so you
should be able to make minor repairs and be self-sufficient with
food and water. There are places to buy fluids, but they are few
and far between.
</P>
<P>
   What to take: Items to change flats (tubes, air canisters), two
water bottles (you'll need both), map and nutritional bars.

 &HT;    New Yorker tours the lake and finds history, harmony and
cocoanut cream pie
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKEECHOBEE, Fla. _ I steered our aging Ford Tempo to the steep
slope of dirt and floored the accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there it was: Lake Okeechobee. And we were about to
plunge into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit the brakes, hit the brakes,'' my wife sputtered in fear. I
thrust the tape of life's greatest moments into my mental VCR as I
imagined the car slowly sinking to the bottom. Only my 6-year-old
son registered the right reaction, giggling in delight at my
vehicular idiocy.
</P>
<P>
   The joke was that we had been driving for miles and miles,
trying to catch a glimmer of water, but the earthen dam stood in
our way. What did I expect to find on the other side? Chopped
liver?
</P>
<P>
   We stopped just inches before the inevitable downward roll.
Maybe this was going to be a memorable vacation after all.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Okeechobee is the second-largest lake in the United States
and a mecca for fishermen, but as Florida tourist destinations go,
it ranks well below Disney et al. Beyond the water, its actual
attractions are few. There are no souvenir stands, no T-shirts
imprinted with the words, ``My grandma went to Lake Okeechobee and
all I got was this lousy T-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there's a Florida that lives up to its simple Southern
setting. A Florida that a New York native like me never knew
existed.
</P>
<P>
   We planned our three-day winter trip to be a voyage of
discovery. We wanted to see the lake and the towns around it.
</P>
<P>
   While it's possible to hop from hotel to hotel as you circle the
lake, we preferred working from a single locale. We picked the new
Holiday Inn Express in Okeechobee. It's a no-nonsense chain hotel,
with the customary complimentary breakfast and rooms that
comfortably accommodate a small family.
</P>
<P>
   But the lake became the constant of the trip. Covering more than
730 square miles, it's a thing of immense beauty, its name
literally translating as ``big water'' in the Seminole tongue. So
big that when the 1928 hurricane caused it to flood, 2,500 people
died. The result was the aforementioned dam, otherwise known as the
Herbert Hoover Dike: It nearly surrounds the lake.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves anyone who visits the Okeechobee area playing a
hide-and-seek game with the lake. We saw it from all vantages.
</P>
<P>
   Of the official access points, including a number of parks and
canal locks, I'd pick the piers in Pahokee and Okeechobee as the
best. The structures stretch far into the lake. The crowds dispense
free fishing advice and everyone seems to have their radios tuned
to the same gospel station.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the joy of a lake vacation is venturing into
uncharted territory. Somewhere on the western side of the lake, we
stopped by a desolate patch of green, cast our fishing pole and
watched the world go by.
</P>
<P>
   If the lake is a fixed force, the surrounding towns do manage to
differentiate themselves. Here are some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're driving from West Palm Beach, you'll first encounter
Belle Glade, the lake's largest city. If you make one stop, let it
be the Drawbridge Cafe on a Sunday afternoon. The buffet spread is
country cooking at its finest. Drive a little past the restaurant
and you'll see the drawbridge _ a hand-operated wooden marvel of
engineering that allows cars to pass one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the southern end of the lake, Clewiston has a more stately
feel. It's headquarters of United States Sugar Corp., the nation's
largest sugar cane grower, and home to the Clewiston Inn, the
lake's most elegant hotel.
</P>
<P>
   _ To the west are dot-on-the-map towns like Lakeport and
Buckhead Ridge. This is, by far, the lake's most quiet region.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're willing to make a slight trek, visit Arcadia and
Lake Placid, two towns between the lake and Sarasota. The former
preserves its early 20th-century roots remarkably well, and it
contains a number of fine shops, many within the lovingly restored
Old Opera House Antique Mall and Museum. The latter is famous for
the 270-foot-high Placid Tower and the murals painted on the sides
of many buildings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last, consider an expedition to LaBelle, between the lake and
Fort Myers. There's not much to see, but people come mostly for
Flora and Ella's. The restaurant is everything Cracker Barrel
pretends to be. Have a plate of Lake Okeechobee catfish and finish
the meal with a slice of coconut cream pie. The food is so good,
your arteries will forgive you.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Okeechobee Pier stretches far into the lake, with visitors
dispensing free fishing advice. Radios are tuned to gospel
stations. The lovingly restored Old Opera House Antique Mall and
Museum in Arcadia boasts a ticket booth and other theatrical
treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat index: The most you'll exert yourself on this trip is when
you reel in a fish from the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Drive time: It takes about an hour to get from West Palm Beach
to Lake Okeechobee. We drove about 400 miles over three days as we
circled the lake and visited towns throughout the region (Belle
Glade, Buckhead Ridge, Clewiston, Lakeport, Okeechobee, Pahokee)
and near the Gulf Coast (Arcadia, LaBelle).
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay: The Holiday Inn Express in Okeechobee is a clean,
comfortable chain hotel on the lake's northern point: Summer rates
are $69 per night (holidays slightly higher), includes free
continental breakfast; call (941) 357-3529 or (800) HOLIDAY.
</P>
<P>
   Before you go: You won't find much about Lake Okeechobee in the
traditional travel books. The 1998 Frommer's Florida devotes only
three of its 627 pages to the area. A couple of better sources come
from Sarasota-based Pineapple Press: Bill and Carol Gregware's
Guide to the Lake Okeechobee Area is filled with history going back
to the Ice Age, details about flora and fauna and suggested driving
and biking tours (the maps, though, are somewhat confusing); Bruce
Hunt's Visiting Small-Town Florida provides more colorful
descriptions of some of the area's destinations.

 &HT;    Author wrote artist's colony into her will
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patricia Highsmith made a lot of money writing about the
calculating psychopath Tom Ripley, and, before she died, she made
sure that all of it would go to Yaddo, the upstate New York
artist's retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Highsmith wrote ``Strangers on a Train'' at Yaddo in 1948, and,
in her will, left the colony her $3 million estate, the largest
single gift in the colony's history.
</P>
<P>
   COMING SOON . . . David Guterson's follow-up to ``Snow Falling
on Cedars'' will be titled ``East of the Mountains,'' and, like his
first novel, it's set in the Pacific Northwest. It's about a
terminally ill surgeon who reminisces about his life while on a
hunting trip. Harcourt Brace is expected to publish this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Evans, whose ``The Horse Whisperer'' became an enormous
commercial success worldwide, will also publish this fall. ``The
Loop'' involves a pack of wolves that are plaguing a Montana
ranching town, and the biologist who is trying to save them from
being wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Longstreet Press, which has sold 900,000 copies of
``The Millionaire Next Door,'' not counting the paperback that
comes out this fall, has committed what Publisher's Weekly
estimates as $2 million for the follow-up, ``The Millionaire
Mind.'' (Full disclosure: Longstreet is owned by Cox Enterprises,
which also owns The Palm Beach Post.)
</P>
<P>
   Look for ``The Millionaire Mind'' a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   New and noteworthy . . . ``Pulp Culture'' (Collector's Press,
$39.95) is a scrumptious collection of art from the pulp magazines
of the teens through the '50s, when the form died out.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by genre _ horror, western, and so forth _ the editors
are careful to showcase premium magazines. Hammett's ``The Maltese
Falcon,'' for instance, first appeared in the September 1929
``Black Mask'' (20 cents!), with a nice painting of somebody _ not
Brigid O'Shaughnessy _ firing through a newspaper right at the
reader.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the artists are famous (Wyeth, Leyendecker), but most
were worker bees specializing in lurid action and bug-eyed
monsters, but with great dramatic vitality.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of sub-genres covered by the book, such as
Mad Slasher magazines, featuring woman in various stages of
dishevelment about to be ravaged or dismembered. There are some
images here that are unpublishable today, but are considered
perfectly all right for the unfortunate revival in teenage horror
movies.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderful tour of a publishing universe that no longer
exists. Did you know there was once a magazine called Speakeasy
Stories? How many stories would anybody want to read about
speak-easies?
</P>
<P>
   Quote Unquote . . . ``The dilemma of the critic has always been
that if he knows enough to speak with authority, he knows too much
to speak with detachment.'' _ Raymond Chandler

 &HT;    Pecan logs and cola in Yeehaw junction
 &HT;    A 'trip' up the Reagan Turnpike
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This Ronald Reagan Turnpike name change fiasco has defeated
conventional journalism,'' my editor ranted. ``Wiggins! We need you
to take to the turnpike for a Gonzo journalism perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see,'' I said. ``I like it. You want a desperate and savage
journey up Florida's ulcercated varicose vein. Maybe the trip
itself will reveal what those tapioca brains in Tallahassee had in
mind when they named our turnpike after a California soap
pitchman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't heard the latest?'' my editor blustered.
``Florida's Turnpike is only to be `designated' the Ronald Reagan
Turnpike. Go on the road, Wiggins. Don't stop until you reach the
Stuckey's in Yeehaw Junction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'll need mind-altering substances,'' I replied.
``A case of Jolt Cola, a half-pound of Jelly Bellies and three
pounds of cinnamon Red Hots ought to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine, Wiggins. But just remember: There is nothing more
irresponsible and dangerous than an aging Gonzo journalist in the
throes of a cinnamon Red Hot sugar high.''
</P>
<P>
   Photographer Jennifer Podis and I headed straight for the West
Palm Beach interchange on Okeechobee Boulevard. ``We'll find out
what the toll-takers know,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously under strict orders, the toll takers wouldn't talk. A
quick call to the regional toll office revealed that all turnpike
employees are brain-dead to the press, as a matter of policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if toll booth personnel had an opinion, it would be
inappropriate for them to express it,'' a turnpike spokesman in
Fort Lauderdale explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, really?'' I retorted. ``And I suppose if the governor
wanted to rename the turnpike the
Have-Cards-Ready-and-Tip-Attendant-Fifteen-Percent-Parkway, they
wouldn't have an opinion on that either?'' I hung up and walked
back to the car.
</P>
<P>
   Podis suggested that we get rolling interviews every time we
picked up a card or paid a toll. Sneaky. I liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few Jelly Bellies might loosen their tongues,'' I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   We exited at Palm Beach Gardens, and I asked the woman who took
my 50 cents, real casual like, ``Why did they change the name?''
</P>
<P>
   She met my gaze steadily and said carefully: ``I have no idea
why they did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Her co-worker in the other booth said: ``What difference does it
make to Reagan? He's got Alzheimer's and won't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   I saw her point. And what's the deal on ``designating'' a
highway after someone if you're not going to change the name? Isn't
that a little like saying, ``Mr. President, we want to honor you by
naming the bleakest strip of asphalt this side of Death Valley
after you, but we're kidding about the name change part.''
</P>
<P>
   I cracked a can of Jolt and tore open the bag of cinnamon Red
Hots. ``We obviously need more sugar,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   We left the turnpike at Jupiter and swung into the parking lot
of the Palm Beach County Visitors Center on Indiantown Road.
Inside, we met supervisor Alan Bernstein, who only compounded the
mystery of the Name Change that Wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Reagan?'' Bernstein asked. ``If you're going to change the
name of the Florida Turnpike, why not somebody from Florida? Ponce
de Leon? Claude Pepper?
</P>
<P>
   (Not bad, I mused. The Pepper Parkway. ``The beach? Take the
Pepper Parkway to your Burt Reynolds exit ramp in Jupiter, go east
across the Perry Como Causeway, and you're at Sally Beach.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Or,'' Bernstein proposed, ``name it after Lawton Chiles.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to picture it. The Walkin' Lawton He-Coon Parkway. The
Republicans wouldn't go for it, even if they eight-laned the thing
with tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the turnpike, we set course for Yeehaw Junction. The
candy was gone and I was feening for a fix. ``Are you going to be
all right?'' Podis asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as my cavities are aching, I'm OK,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside Stuckey's, I loaded up on pecan logs, Pecan Goo-Goo
Clusters, Pecan Brittle and Tom's Pecan Pies. I sat down at a booth
and ordered a large Coke, easy on the ice, and a bag of
Cajun-boiled peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear about them calling the Turnpike the Ronald Reagan
Turnpike,'' I asked fry cook Dorisene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's stupid,'' she said. ``He didn't do nothing for
nobody _ Lord, don't go putting down my name! OK, just my first
name.''
</P>
<P>
   A male customer in his early 60s, overhearing us, volunteered:
``It's silly naming it after somebody from another state. Chiles is
a good man; name it after him.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked the man his name. ``Carl,'' he said. ``I work over here
on the turnpike.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, Carl, but I can't quote an employee of the Florida
Turnpike Authority. It is inappropriate for you to have an
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my day off,'' he said. ``Just put `Carl.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Stuckey's manager Pat Hutto dismissed the name change flap as
``B.S. _ you're just going to confuse everybody. First they call it
the Sunshine Parkway, then the Florida Turnpike, and now the Reagan
Turnpike?''
</P>
<P>
   Cashier Fran LaJoie concurred. ``You get people not knowing
where they're going, asking for the turnpike and there it is 100
feet away.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking mild exception was vacationer George Spivey, on his way
to Key West. ``I think it's pretty neat calling it the Reagan
Turnpike. We have a Ronald Reagan Parkway in Atlanta. Reagan was a
no-nonsense guy. He let you know where he stood.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading back to West Palm Beach, we found one more champion of
the name change (OK, the name ``designation'') in Margarita Ortiz,
cashier at the Fort Drum Plaza. ``President Reagan deserves the
honor,'' she said. ``He was our president for eight years. He
didn't do so well, but he still deserves our respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading back, I let an entire Stuckey's pecan praline dissolve
in my mouth as I tried to synthesize all we had learned into one
incandescent insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny,'' Podis said, as we passed Jupiter, ``how the turnpike
runs right beside I-95 for so many miles.''
</P>
<P>
   I stared at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that's it!'' I shrieked, sitting bolt upright and
pointing to the stream of interstate traffic not 200 yards from us.
``Don't designate the turnpike after Reagan. Name Interstate 95
after him all the way up to Canada!''
</P>
<P>
   I pulled over and Podis took the wheel as I ranted. I found some
cinnamon Red Hots that had spilled into the console and shoved them
in my mouth. I chased them with warm soda. My fillings shrieked
from sugar overload. I'd found my answer. And not a minute before
my brain exploded.

 &HT;    Ahhh....It's a whole new world; find bliss at a quiet garden,
spa
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ On a steamy summer day at any jammed
Disney World theme park, you begin to think that peace and quiet
can come only if you pass out.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to black out to bliss out at Disney World. If
you know where to look, there are a few places where the lure is
lazy and laconic and you may even learn something.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven forbid, don't tell Michael Eisner, but there are people
who abhor theme parks and are delivered there by family or fate on
a forced march. Those tortured tourists will discover it's the
quiet, quality stops that give them reason to march on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gardens of the World _ Much of Disney's reputation for
fastidious control begins with its precise and pristine
landscaping. The themed shrubs along with the trees, flowers and
lawns make even some golf courses look like abandoned lots.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a Disney theme park ticket to take the 3 1/2 hour
behind-the-scenes Epcot landscaping tour called Gardens of the
World.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Institute tour costs $45 per person and includes a
walking tour of Epcot's gardens with experts explaining the
landscaping and growing plan. You need to be 15 or older for this
tour. For information and reservations, call (407) 939-8687.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hidden Treasures of the World Showcase _ Not everything at
Disney is a plastic version of the real thing. This tour through
Epcot's 11 countries offers a look at the usually overlooked art,
architecture and costumes. You'll go backstage at France and Canada
while dwelling on the details of the other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Disney Imagineers explain how some of the theme park's illusions
were created and why. The tour is $75 per person with lunch and $60
without the meal. Both prices include a Hidden Treasures booklet.
For information and reservations, call (407) 939-8687.
</P>
<P>
   _ Voodoo Garden at the House of Blues _ Downtown Disney _ The
Cajun/Creole-themed House of Blues offers a quiet, 20-table deck
overlooking Lake Buena Vista. Set in a brick garden and patio, you
can get a limited menu of dinner choices in this quiet setting.
Live music is featured during the summer on Thursday, Friday and
Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discovery Island _ Within site of the always-crowded Magic
Kingdom and the chaos of the Contemporary Hotel is dreamy Discovery
Island. What you discover on this 12-acre island is the quiet of a
self-guided tour through a South Seas jungle home to a wide variety
of animals.
</P>
<P>
   You walk along tree-shaded paths to see 140 species of birds,
mammals and reptiles. The Avian Way is home to 14 bird varieties.
An animal hospital lets you watch vets at work. There are places to
buy food and souvenirs. Daily shows involve birds and reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery Island is a short boat ride across Bay Lake near the
Contemporary Hotel. The price for adults is $11.95 and $6.50 for
kids (ages 3-9).
</P>
<P>
   Disney hotel guests can get Discovery Island information at
guest relations and non-hotel visitors can board the boat to
Discovery Island at the Contemporary Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Victoria &AMP; Albert's restaurant _ Grand Floridian Resort &AMP; Spa
_ If you take a date to Victoria &AMP; Albert's romance-drenched dining
room and hot, monkey love doesn't happen as soon as you get back to
the hotel room, yours is the definition of a dead-end relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Only 18 tables make up the exclusive Victoria &AMP; Albert's at the
Grand Floridian. A harp plays as you pace yourself through a
seven-course meal that includes four entrees, served on Royal
Doulton China with Schott-Zweisel crystal and Sambonet silver. An
extensive wine selection is also available.
</P>
<P>
   There are two seatings daily, 5:45-6:30 p.m. and 9-9:45 p.m.,
with reservations a must. This is the only Disney restaurant where
jackets are required.
</P>
<P>
   Diners are pampered by formal service that includes a butler and
a maid for each table. Each customer gets to take home a
handwritten, personalized menu and women are given a long-stemmed
rose.
</P>
<P>
   Prices begin at $80 per person for the seven-course dinner, $110
if you want a different wine with each course.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonal menu is American regional with classical
influences. Daily choices include fish, fowl, red meat, veal and
lamb.
</P>
<P>
   For reservations, call: (407) 939-7707.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oak Trail golf course _ Maybe every other golfer wouldn't be
10 or 70 pounds overweight if players routinely walked the course
hauling their own clubs. But they don't, and getting in and out of
golf carts won't make you buff but will create a big duff.
</P>
<P>
   At Disney's nine-hole family Oak Trail course you have to walk
the course and pull your clubs along. The 40-acre quiet course is
par 36 with fairways lined by oak trees and plenty of water
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The longest hole is the 517-yard No. 5 featuring a double
dog-leg with a green guarded by bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   Nine holes at Oak Trail is $20 for juniors (age 17 and under)
and $32 for adults. You can rent clubs for $15, no charge for
junior clubs. For tee times that can be reserved by resort guests
up to 60 days in advance (or 30 days in advance for non-resort
guests), call (407) 939-4653.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grand Floridian Spa &AMP; Health Club _ After a stressed-out day
battling theme park crowds, even a sleazy, fake massage parlor with
gum-chewing, big-hair ``blondes'' named Tawny and Tiffany would be
relaxing. (And they model lingerie for you, too!)
</P>
<P>
   So imagine how relaxing a legit health spa would be while the
rest of the family battles wide-bodies for life-saving shade at the
Magic Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Hours are 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily at the Grand Floridian Spa &AMP;
Health Club, where they'll loosen muscles you didn't know you had
in a setting so serene you'll think you're medicated in a
psychiatric ward for rich people.
</P>
<P>
   You can get treatments from around the world including Japan
(Shiatsu Therapy), Germany (The Kur), France (Thalasso Cure),
Mexico (Wild, Wild West Treatment). Massages start with a 25 minute
basic rubdown ($47.20) and run to the exotic along with facials,
manicures, pedicures and every other legal thing you can have done
to you at a spa.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a day at the spa or a day at any theme park, the smart
ones will go to the spa's front desk, hand over a credit card and
plead, ``help meeeee.''
</P>
<P>
   For reservations or information, call (407) 824-2332.

 &HT;    Sidebar to ORLANDO1

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Although The Courtyard at Lake Lucerne is
virtually under the East-West Expressway _ and within walking
distance of downtown _ you won't hear a thing. Maybe it's the
thick-walled construction of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   The bed-and-breakfast is a trio of buildings that includes the
Norment-Parry Inn, Orlando's oldest house (built in 1883) with six
rooms each decorated by a different designer (you'll love the pink
and green Baby's Room); the Wellborn Building, Art Deco suites with
period furniture, such as a zebra-print sofa; and the I.W. Phillips
House, which has French doors, a wraparound veranda and a baby
grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   Antiques are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside is sidewalk-lined Lake Lucerne (schedule a few
laps) and the Lake Cherokee Historic District, filled with stately
homes dating from the mid-1880s.
</P>
<P>
   A breakfast buffet is served each morning (no lunch or dinner),
plus a bottle of wine greets guests upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Chill out in a porch swing, a claw-foot bathtub or an
overstuffed chintz chair. This is definitely the slow lane (but
conveniently close to the fast lane).
</P>
<P>
   Directions: Take Florida's Turnpike to Interstate 4 East. Exit
at Anderson Street, and turn right. Continue through next three
lights and turn right onto Delaney Avenue. Take the first right
onto Lucerne Circle North.
</P>
<P>
   Rates: Norment-Parry Victorian rooms, $85-$119; Wellborn
one-bedroom suites, $109, and honeymoon suite, $150; I.W. Phillips
Edwardian suites, $120-$165. Rates are single or double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   In each room: TV, telephone, clock radio, private bath.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The Courtyard isn't geared for kids under 12. Teens are
allowed in Wellborn suites for an additional $15 per night. No
pets.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Get up, get out, and go downtown
 &HT;    Has sidebars: ORLANDO2, ORLANDO3
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Sidestep the mousetrap.
</P>
<P>
   While most folks assume a trip to Orlando means Disney World,
you can have fun galore in Florida's largest inland city without
ever entering a theme park _ or even driving a car, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   At Church Street Station downtown, you'll find everything from a
Dixieland revue with waitresses who cancan on the bar to a
restaurant with a table that once belonged to gangster Al Capone.
Just down the way is a haunted house, and in between are bars
aplenty (consider having a drink before you meet the ax-wielding
mummy).
</P>
<P>
   Three blocks northeast of this tourist enclave is sidewalk-lined
Lake Eola, complete with swan-shaped paddle boats.
</P>
<P>
   Stroll south for about 25 minutes, and you'll hit the historic
Courtyard at Lake Lucerne, a bed-and-breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you'll notice about downtown Orlando: It's the kind of
place where people hold hands. Maybe it's because they're relaxed.
After all, it is nice not sweltering in line to board Space
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   AT THIS `SWAN LAKE,' YOU CAN PEDAL, HIKE OR BIKE _ OR JUST RELAX
</P>
<P>
   Orlando is loaded with lakes, but its downtown landmark is Lake
Eola, encircled by a wide walkway and lush grounds. Take a stroll,
and you'll see soaring skyscrapers on one side and Spanish moss
swinging from trees on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine taking your lunch break at a place like this during the
workweek! Bikes and skates are forbidden, so this is truly a
walker's paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Water gushes down a tiered fountain that resembles a giant
wedding cake (especially at night with the lights). Park benches
are plentiful, and there's even a snack bar, playground and band
shell, home of the Orlando Shakespeare Festival each spring.
</P>
<P>
   Just to say you did it: Rent a swan-shaped paddleboat ($7 per
half hour), and enjoy some fowl play. Locals will warn you how hard
the boats are to maneuver, but they're really not that tough. (If
you get in a bind, a motorboat will tow you in.)
</P>
<P>
   If you'd rather just sit and watch other folks pedal, try Lee's
Lakeside, on the lake's southeast corner. The long-established
restaurant _ at Central Boulevard and Osceola Avenue _ offers prime
viewing, plus an awesome $16.95 Sunday brunch from 11 a.m. to 3
p.m. (Omelettes! Roast beef! Crabmeat stuffed mushrooms!)
</P>
<P>
   Dinner menu items include Florentine pasta Alfredo with pine
nuts, $8.95; fresh fruit salad with cottage cheese and sherbet,
$14.95; and lobster tail with prime rib or filet mignon, $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, and reservations
are recommended: (407) 841-1565
</P>
<P>
   STREET SCENE: HOT DRINKS, CHEAP THRILLS
</P>
<P>
   Here, in a totally subjective analysis, is what's hot, hokey and
hair-raising in downtown Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Best-of-show strawberry daiquiri _ $5.50 at Rosie O'Grady's.
Four berries splayed on the rim, whipped cream and a cherry.
</P>
<P>
   Hottest drink (literally) _ $9.25 Flaming Hurricane hawked in
every bar at Church Street Station. Liquor concoction with lemon
extract set ablaze (really) on top. Extinguish before sippin'.
</P>
<P>
   Least attractive store (again, literally) _ The magnet specialty
shop at Church Street Exchange. Forget finding a treasure.
Everything says Florida. Enough already.
</P>
<P>
   Strangest fashion trend _ Pantyhose with shorts. These gals
can't be Floridians.
</P>
<P>
   Cheapest thrill _ $5 Gyronaut ride at Church Street Market.
Strap in, flip around, and turn green in minutes (especially if
you've had a few Flaming Hurricanes).
</P>
<P>
   Goofiest huckster _ A guy sporting inflatable biceps and a
Viking hat (a motorcycle helmet topped with horns) who hands out
fliers for restaurants and bars.
</P>
<P>
   Trendiest name _ Ayme, a clerk at Speedo Authentic Fitness.
``Yes, that's really how it's spelled, but it's pronounced Amy. My
mother's very creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Most flexible pet _ Herbie the boa, wrapped around the
handlebars of Greg Walker's Harley-Davidson. ``I've never measured
him,'' says Walker, an art director.
</P>
<P>
   Sneakiest photo op _ At the end of Terror on Church Street, a
haunted house with actors that lunge at you. Eek! You'll most
likely be screaming or have your head down in this surprise
souvenir picture, which costs $10. (Admission is $12.)
</P>
<P>
   Best spot to meet strangers _ Also at Terror on Church Street,
open Monday through Thursday and Sunday from 7 p.m. to midnight;
Friday and Saturday until 1 a.m. You do a 20-minute walk-through
with your hands on the shoulders or waist of the person in front of
you. (I clutched Dennis Delgado of West Palm Beach, who was there
with his girlfriend, Suzanne Filomia.)
</P>
<P>
   Laziest way to sightsee _ Via horse-drawn carriage (think New
York's Central Park). Carriages run nightly from about 8 till
midnight, and a 30-minute jaunt costs $25 per couple (although
rates may vary depending on which driver you ask). Rides start at
Church Street Market, the newer shopping strip just outside Church
Street Station. It's worth $10 more to go all the way around Lake
Eola.

 &HT;    Fire in the sky ignites fear in Junction
 &HT;    By C. Patrick Cleary
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colorado _ Bobbie Garcia saw it, but didn't
believe it, so she called the fire department to find out what was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were scared,'' the Orchard Mesa mother said. ``It was like
'Oh my God, it's going to hit. We are dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia got home shortly after 10:30 p.m. Tuesday and called the
fire department to say she thought she, her children and some
friends saw something explode in the sky and fall west toward the
Colorado National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``He explained it was a meteorite and if you are not dead yet,
don't worry,'' she said. ``It would not have taken long.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, according to Western Colorado Astronomy Club President
Mark Goodrich, saw what's referred to as a bolide.
</P>
<P>
   A bolide is a meteor or shooting star that explodes in the sky.
Bolides are rare to witness.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich has never seen one. He's seen the moving objects' heat
until they have a white-hot tail but never what Garcia described.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw it heading north up behind the Elks bingo on Orchard
Mesa,'' Garcia recalled. ``We looked up and saw a big ball of fire
out of the clouds. It had a tail and the rear end of it turned
bright red. We saw this. I swear to God on my kids. It exploded and
it shot out like a little red sparkles.''
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds later she heard what sounded like a sonic boom.
Central dispatch said one person called Wednesday morning to report
seeing something explode above the monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``We referred them to the FAA or the UFO hot line,'' a
dispatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich said that, because Garcia heard the boom shortly after
seeing the explosion, he believes the bolide was closer than most.
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 tons of space debris enter the earth's atmosphere
annually, Goodrich said. The majority of it burns up in the
atmosphere and never has the chance to touch the surface of the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this stuff enters the atmosphere all the time but to
actually see that is unusual,'' Goodrich said. ``It is kind of
neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolides range in size from that of a golf ball to a house,
Goodrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich said typically the best time to see meteorites and
bolides is about 3 a.m. when the earth's rotation is in the right
position to pick out the streaks of light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen shooting stars,'' Garcia said. ``I love the sky. I'm
always watching. I'm always telling my husband to get me a
telescope. He got me a pair of binoculars. Gosh hon, I want a
telescope.''

 &HT;    A beloved guitar gone -- a friend found
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin guitars. Finest in the world. Handmade in the USA. Aged
spruce tops that turn vibrations into rich, resonant music that can
fill a concert hall. Rosewood body that glows deep red like a
tropical sunset. If Florida homes were braced like Martin guitars
they would be hurricane impervious.
</P>
<P>
   I bought my Martin guitar 26 years ago this week with three
years' worth of bartending tips.
</P>
<P>
   I sold it yesterday. It wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate was a hint in June 1972. The war in Vietnam wasn't
over. Bill Gates hadn't even set up his garage workshop. And I
lived for bluegrass music, cold beer and pretty girls. My horizons
extended all the way to the next $50 gig, the next beer, the next
girl. My Martin was my most prized possession. Except for a
decrepit, black VW beetle I had won in a poker game and a pile of
philosophy books, it was my only possession.
</P>
<P>
   I played it every day _ six, eight hours, a day. Sometimes my
fingers bled.
</P>
<P>
   The guitar baked on a hot stage under a July sun at the New York
State Fair where my band opened for the Byrds. It took me to
Nashville, Boston and roadhouses up and down the east coast. It
inhaled a lifetime supply of cigarette smoke at Ide's Bowling Lanes
in Ithaca, N.Y., where we played for beer until the owner figured
out it was cheaper to pay us cash money.
</P>
<P>
   It took me to North Carolina, where Doc Watson picked a tune on
it in the shadow of Grandfather Mountain. Arlo Guthrie strummed it
at a Cornell gig. At an old-time revival near Saratoga, Ricky
Skaggs pronounced it ``sweet.'' Tony Rice, Russ Barenburg, Lester
Flatt, Bill Monroe, they all played my guitar. If you know folk
music, you know who they are.
</P>
<P>
   More than one girlfriend said choose: her or the guitar. I
forget their names.
</P>
<P>
   It predated my first marriage. It post-dated my first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   I played Irish lullabies to my daughters every night for 10
years. When my oldest daughter was big enough to get an arm around
the guitar, I taught her a few chords. She learned a lick of
``Greensleeves.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I found an even sweeter sounding Martin. This time, no
scrimping was necessary. My relative fortunes were waxing. The old
guitar spent more time in its case, more time in the closet.
Months. Years. It became the Puff the Magic Dragon of guitars,
still loved but very lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Teenage daughters, huge phone bills, college coming fast, two
boys with big appetites. The old guitar, regrettably, became
something other than a storehouse of memories, something other than
a masterfully crafted musical instrument. It became an
under-utilized capital asset.
</P>
<P>
   So I put the ad in the paper a few weeks ago and all sorts of
people wanted my guitar and the more they tried to talk me into
lowering my good price the less I felt like selling. They frowned
and furrowed their brows and examined my old Martin like a kid
picks at a plate of lukewarm lima beans. It needs this, it needs
that, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But old Martins don't need anything, except to be played. They
were nitpickers, I told myself, not guitar pickers. I decided to
keep it.
</P>
<P>
   But one last guy was coming to the house. One last nitpicker,
most likely.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Chaney's his name. He's 74. He picked up that guitar like it
was a new baby and turned it over and looked at it, gazed deep into
the brilliant finish, ran his fingers gently down its back and up
its neck.
</P>
<P>
   I don't play, he said. I just love them, always wanted one. He
speaks with a south Georgia lilt.
</P>
<P>
   A daughter and a grandson are all the family he has. Wife gone,
Georgia kin gone, army buddies gone. He's got his butterfly gardens
behind his home, 200 varieties of hibiscus, miniature red peppers,
old and bulbous ponytail palms. He does volunteer work at Mounts
Botanical Gardens. He's happy, he says, and busy.
</P>
<P>
   But he wants something to leave to his grandson. He wants an old
Martin. My old Martin.
</P>
<P>
   So we sit for an hour and Sam talks and we go from music to his
war, the big one. Silver Star for taking out a German machinegun
nest in France, 1944. The German gunners ambushed and killed 23 of
the 49 men in his platoon before they met Pfc. Sam Chaney. He was
19. He was promoted to sergeant, earned six battle stars, nearly
froze his toes off in the Battle of the Bulge. Two years later he
was a squad leader in Nuremberg after the war crimes trials. A
firing squad. I did my duty, he says. He speaks softly.
</P>
<P>
   Sam's talking and I'm listening and feeling downright inclined
to give the guy the guitar. I want my kids to meet him, to hear his
stories and see his gardens. Come on over for iced tea, he offers.
You visit, too, I say.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the guitar? I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I'd like it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He pays for the guitar. Cash. Sam doesn't quibble.
</P>
<P>
   The last I see of my guitar it's riding like an old pal right
next to Sam in the cab of his pickup.
</P>
<P>
   After he's gone I realize that after weeks of seeing ghosts and
faded memories every time I looked at the guitar my feelings are no
longer mixed. I feel good. Sam feels good. Hell, the guitar would
feel good if it could. It has a new friend.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I do, too.

 &HT;    Due this fall: sure things, in the publishing world
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ These days publishers look for the sure thing whenever
possible. The books planned for fall demonstrate that. There's
everything from Sophia Loren to George Bush to Alice Walker, to a
glorious picture book history of the West, to histories of the
journey from slavery, to a book about turning 50 (Prince Charles).
</P>
<P>
   A recent interest in memoirs, the perennial interest in
cookbooks and the public fascination with film stars made ``Sophia
Loren's Recipes &AMP; Memories'' (GT Publishing) a likely project.
Cookbooks always sell, even as diet books do.
</P>
<P>
   Laced with photographs of the star wearing an apron in the
kitchen, ``Recipes &AMP; Memories'' is the most glamorous _ if not the
most literary _ of the many new books due out this fall. (It
doesn't hurt that Loren's cookbook comes on the heels of ``Sophia
Loren,'' Warren Harris' biography of the film star from Simon &AMP;
Schuster.)
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Book Expo in Chicago, where publishers displayed
their fall lists to the nation's booksellers, Loren's cool presence
lent luster. Wearing tiny spectacles, the author/star spoke of
growing up impoverished in Italy during the turmoil of World War
II, but credited her grandmother, Nonna Luisa, with giving her a
love of cooking: soup, pasta, pizza, vegetables, desserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her genius could flavor even a few crumbs of stale bread with
herbs and turn them into an elegant dish. . . . It is to Grandma
Luisa that I wish to dedicate this cookbook. Not only for the many
things I've learned from her, but for her ability to transform even
the most ordinary food into something succulent.''
</P>
<P>
   At 63, with her taut skin and shapely legs that look decades
younger, Loren is a fine advertisement for eating from the
cookbook, to be published in October. It's her first cookbook since
1972, when Doubleday published her ``In the Kitchen With Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a month-by-month summary of some other books to watch for
in the next few months. It's only a sample. You'll notice that
several Austin writers will be among those with upcoming books,
competing with Sophia Loren for your dollars. Upcoming book
releases August ''Irrational Fears,'' by Austin's William Browning
Spencer. An offbeat novel about alcoholism and recovery (White
Wolf). ''Into That Good Night,'' an East Texas memoir by Ron
Rozelle about his father's struggle with Alzheimer's disease
(Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux). ''Farley's Jewel,'' by Jon Ferguson, a
novel about a philosopher of everyday things (Cinco Puntos Press).
''Love is a Racket,'' by John Ridley. A dark farce about a
screenwriter by the author of ``Stray Dogs'' (Knopf.) ''The
Illustrated History of Britain,'' first two volumes, by University
of Texas professor Roger Louis (Oxford). This book has raised
controversy in England because it's being put together by an
American. ''Created Unequal: The Crisis in American Pay,'' by James
K. Galbraith (The Free Press). A professor at UT's LBJ School of
Public Affairs, Galbraith argues that wage inequality is a result
of government policy and is not inevitable because of technological
advances. ''Fax Me a Bagel,'' by Sharon Kahn. A former rabbi's wife
from Austin begins a mystery series with a rabbi's wife as the
protagonist. (Scribner). September ''A World Transformed,'' by
George Bush and Brent Scowcroft. Former President Bush and his
national security adviser give a behind-the-scenes account of
foreign policy during their administration (Knopf). ''Tomcat in
Love,'' a novel by National Book Award winner Tim O'Brien
(Broadway). Instead of Vietnam, O'Brien is writing about an English
teacher and his attempt to find intimacy. ''The Loop,'' a novel by
Nicholas Evans, who wrote ``The Horse Whisperer'' (Delacorte).
''Written in Stone: Public Monuments in Changing Societies'' by UT
law professor Sanford Levinson (Duke). ''The Farming of Bones,'' a

literary magazine Granta's best young novelists. ''The Voyage of
the Narwhal,'' a novel by Andrea Barrett about the exploration of
the Arctic. Her ``Ship Fever'' won the National Book Award. ''The
New Encyclopedia of the American West,'' edited by Howard R. Lamar.
It contains many Texas references (Yale University Press). ''In the
Black,'' by Fran Harris. The African American Parent's Guide to
Raising Financially Responsible Children (Fireside) by an Austin
Entrepreneur of the Year. ''Something to Declare,'' essays by Julia
Alvarez (Algonquin), author of ``How the Garcia Girls Lost Their
Accents.'' These essays deal with her exile from the Dominican
Republic and her split cultural identity. ''Welcome to the World,
Baby Girl,'' a new novel by Fannie Flagg, author of ``Fried Green
Tomatoes'' (Random House). ''Rumble Tumble,'' by Joe R. Lansdale.
The outrageous East Texas writer brings back Hap Collins and
Leonard Pine for a road trip through the Southwest
(Warner/Mysterious Press). ''Rude Behavior'' by Dan Jenkins. This
is the sequel to ``Semi-Tough,'' a classic novel about Texas
football (Doubleday). ''Holes,'' by Louis Sachar. This novel for
age 12 and up by an Austin writer deals with a boy sent by mistake
to a juvenile detention center (Farrar Straus Giroux). October
''Africans in America: America's Journey Through Slavery,'' by
Patricia Smith and Charles Johnson. This book, a companion to a PBS
series, tells the story of American history from the African
American point of view and includes short stories by Johnson
(Harcourt, Brace). ''By the Light of My Father's Smile,'' a new
novel by Alice Walker. It's about a family from the United States
who goes to Mexico and encounters the Mundo, a band of mixed race
blacks and Indians (Random House). ''I Married a Communist,'' a
tragic novel by Philip Roth set in the McCarthy era (Houghton
Mifflin). ''Purple Dots,'' a novel by Jim Lehrer. Set in
Washington, D.C., this political mystery centers on the president's

 &HT;    Ford, Heche crash on Island: this romantic comedy does too
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harrison Ford and Anne Heche may be stuck on a deserted island
in ``Six Days, Seven Nights,'' but the real problem is they've been
stranded without much of a script.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, such as it is, doesn't know whether it wants to
be a romantic comedy or an adventure saga. As a compromise, it's
anemic at both. Like Ford's rickety airplane, which is hemorrhaging
oil when we first see it, ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' is about a
quart low. Low on excitement, low on chemistry between its stars,
low on reason for being.
</P>
<P>
   To escape snowy New York, magazine editor Robin Monroe (Heche)
and her puppyish boyfriend (``Friends''' David Schwimmer) head to a
Pacific island resort, chartering a ride from surly
pilot-mechanic-beach bum Quinn Harris (Ford). Before long, though,
an unexpected assignment arises for Robin in Tahiti and she is
flying off again with Quinn, straight into a tropical storm. Before
you can say ``Gilligan,'' they are forced into an emergency landing
on a gorgeous, uninhabited island, far from civilization and
cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   So Robin and Quinn bicker and banter in that Hollywood semaphore
that is code for the imminent outbreak of love. When screenwriter
Michael Browning tires of this _ long after we have _ he brings
ashore a band of pirates that can't shoot straight to chase after
the fun couple. Add a scorpion in Robin's hair and a snake down her
shorts and you have a prototype for a new thrill ride at Disney
World.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't have is a sufficiently interesting movie. In
part, that's because Ford makes a gruff, ham-handed light comedian.
(Didn't anyone at Touchstone see ``Sabrina''?) So halfway through,
the movie makes a course correction, taking a left turn into Ford's
action hero strength. But these days, it is hard to get very worked
up over a handful of cross-eyed pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Since being cast as Robin, Heche has gone public with her
lesbian orientation, which suddenly gave this movie some off-screen
drama. If ``Six Days'' disappoints at the box office, she
undoubtedly will be made the scapegoat. Heche's relationship with
Ford is truly hard to buy, but that's because he is nearly 30 years
older than she is. The age mismatch is so apparent that the movie
jokes about it, but the problem lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Heche gamely does a few comic pratfalls, looking alternately
silly and smashing, changing outfits several times on the desert
island. Maybe she found a Gap outlet hidden among the jungle trees.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is directed by Ivan Reitman (``Ghostbusters,''
``Dave'') with a definite energy deficiency, but a keen eye for
paradise landscapes. The movie looks good, but it fails to grab and
hold our interest. As a hybrid romance-adventure, it seems
calculated to reach a demographically wide audience, but neither
part of this Polynesian stew is very satisfying.

   $ADV14  AN AMERICAN-TRAINED JOURNALIST
LANGUISHES IN NIGERIAN PRISON
 &HT;     For release Sunday, June 14.
 &HT;     By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An American-trained journalist has been languishing
in a Nigerian prison since May 1995, her health deteriorating, her
eyesight failing.
</P>
<P>
   What was the crime for which this 46-year-old mother of two was
sentenced to life in prison, later reduced to 15 years?
</P>
<P>
   She did what she had learned to do here in the United States:
she wrote an article critical of the government of Nigerian
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died of a heart attack on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For that action, Christiana Anyanwu was hauled before a military
tribunal and tried _ without even a lawyer to plead her case _ on
charges of treason.
</P>
<P>
   American journalists write critical articles about the
government every day with little fear that their stories will not
result in harsh reprisals. Around the world, courageous journalists
risk their freedom and their lives when they attempt to write or
broadcast the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee to Protect Journalists recently reported that 20
other journalists are in Nigerian prisons. Mrs. Anyanwu is the only
woman among those prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, Nigeria is far away, and what happens there
barely registers on our conscience. But the United States has a
strong interest in Nigeria. It is one of the world's leading oil
producers, and recent offshore finds suggest petroleum reserves
rivaling those in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   American oil companies deal extensively with Nigeria, and what
America thinks should matter very much to the military strong men
who rule the country with an iron fist.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Mrs. Anyanwu was a media star in her native land.
After receiving her bachelor's degree at the University of Missouri
and her masters degree at Florida State University she returned to
Nigeria in 1979 and covered the National Assembly on Nigerian
television. In 1990, she left television to establish a news
magazine, The Sunday Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Things got dicey when the military refused to accept the June
12, 1993, election of Chief Mashood K. Abiola. Although Abiola won
with 58 percent of the vote in an election monitored by more than
1,000 international observers, the military didn't like the
results.
</P>
<P>
   They threw President-elect Abiola in prison where he, too,
remains without medical attention. Mrs. Anyanwu wrote an article
urging recognition of the election and Chief Abiola's installation
as president. For that she was accused of participating in a
military coup to overthrow the military junta.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week at the National Press Club, Chief
Abiola's daughter, Hafsat, 23, a magna cum laude graduate of
Harvard University, said she could empathize with Mrs. Anyanwu's
22-year-old daughter, Ihuoma, who recently graduated from Rutgers
University.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Abiola said she could understand Miss Anyanwu's anguish in
not being able to see her mother. Miss Abiola's mother was
assassinated, her body riddled with bullets, as she rode in a car
to the Canadian Embassy to seek support for her imprisoned husband.
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Abiola said Miss Anyanwu's anguish has a different
quality. At least Miss Abiola knows what happened to her mother.
Miss Anyanwu doesn't know from day to day how her mother is being
treated; whether she is being properly fed, or _ as Miss Abiola
said _ whether her mother is being assaulted by prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Anyanwu's daughter, her 16-year-old son, and her
husband, a visiting professor at Howard University, not knowing her
fate is a terrible anguish they endure daily. The family had to
flee Nigeria when Mrs. Anyanwu was arrested because, in Nigeria,
the government often arrests the entire family when persecuting one
member.
</P>
<P>
   The hallmark of a democratic government is freedom of the press.
Clearly, in Nigeria, where reporters are jailed for writing
articles the government doesn't like, there is no freedom of the
press and no democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the National Press Club last week
hand-delivered a letter to the Nigerian Embassy urging its new
leader, Gen. Abdusalam Abubakar, to release Mrs. Anyanwu. Failing
that, the press club urged that she at least be allowed to receive
medical attention, which the club has agreed to sponsor. (A
personal disclosure: I am the vice president of the National Press
Club.)
</P>
<P>
   The death of Gen. Abacha last week gives Nigeria a golden
opportunity to restore democracy. Gen. Abubakar has indicated he
will hold elections this fall, but he did not offer any hope for
the release of Mrs. Anyanwu or Chief Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   If he's serious about restoring democracy, he will release Mrs.
Anyanwu and her colleagues.

 &HT;    Music reunites Crosby, son he gave away
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a three-decade rock 'n' roll career, David Crosby has
probably supplied enough stories to keep a struggling supermarket
tabloid from going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of heroin and cocaine addictions. A nine-month stint in a
Texas prison. And a down-to-the-wire liver transplant that saved
his life in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the most remarkable story is just emerging.
</P>
<P>
   While Crosby was preparing for his transplant, he learned a son
he gave up for adoption in the '60s had been searching for him. He
met the man, James Raymond, and discovered that his abandoned child
had grown up to be _ what else? _ a successful keyboardist and
composer.
</P>
<P>
   The two started writing songs together, hooked up with studio
guitarist Jeff Pevar and faster than you can say Crosby, Stills and
Nash, a new trio was born.
</P>
<P>
   Call them Crosby, Pevar and Raymond, or CPR for short. Given
that they started just as Crosby was getting a second lease on
life, the name certainly applies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a song fountain, we have been writing so much,'' the
56-year-old Crosby brags of the new group, which played the
Carefree Theatre in West Palm Beach, Fla., on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, 36, confirms the atmosphere has been electric. ``I
think we both hear things very much the same way,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond was born when the future Rock and Roll Hall of Famer was
a young, wayward musician. The child was the result of a fleeting
relationship _ Crosby refuses to identify the mother _ and was put
up for adoption immediately. ``I was still a kid. There was no way
I could have parented anybody, and the girl who was his mom knew
that,'' Crosby recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But he never forgot the son he fathered _ and as he was awaiting
a new liver, his thoughts grew stronger. ``I was in the hospital
dying, and I knew that I had a son out there some place . . . I had
been beating myself for years about not being there for this kid,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Raymond had done well in the intervening three
decades. Growing up in relative comfort in California _ Crosby's
home state _ he pursued music from an early age, studying classical
first, then jazz. After a short stint at California State
University, he went professional and by the time he was 30, he was
musical director for an award-winning Nickelodeon series
(``Roundhouse'') and a busy touring sideman for everyone from Chaka
Khan to Take 6.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond had known he was adopted from the time he was in grade
school. But it was only when he was established personally (he's
married to a screenwriter and producer) and professionally that he
decided to seek out his birth parents. Imagine his shock when he
saw the name David Crosby on his birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was the David Crosby,'' he recalls. But he
checked around and discovered it was true. He contacted Crosby just
before his transplant, and the two met for lunch three months later
in February 1995 at the UCLA Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Raymond describes the encounter: ``There are certain
points in life when everything skews in a new direction, and that
was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   And Crosby? ``He was this nice, decent young guy and we became
friends immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and collaborators. The pair, who consider their
relationship more brotherly than father-and-son, compared musical
notes and found out they had similar tastes and sensibilities.
Granted, Raymond didn't own any CSN albums _ ``I'm a keyboard
player. I spent all my money on Elton John and Stevie Wonder
records'' _ but he knew the group well enough to sing along with
the radio as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered why I blended so well,'' he kids.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby sparked the professional association by giving Raymond a
homework assignment _ the lyrics to a song he was writing inspired
by the tumultuous life of Jim Morrison. ``He was more worried than
I was that it was going to suck,'' Raymond recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But the results spoke otherwise: ``Incredible'' is how Crosby
describes the finished product.
</P>
<P>
   The pair played the piece for Graham Nash at his house _ and it
just so happened that Pevar, a guitarist who's worked with CSN,
also was there. ``He started jamming, and that's when the idea (for
the group) came to David,'' recalls Raymond. By January 1997, CPR
was playing dates.
</P>
<P>
   Although Crosby will slip in reworked versions of some of his
greatest hits in concert, the group is clearly not a CSN clone. If
anything, critics have likened its jazzy sensibility to another
group from the past, Steely Dan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely David's folk influence, but harmonically it
is pretty advanced kind of stuff,'' Raymond explains. ``I don't
know if jazz is the right word to describe the flavor, but it's
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Crosby also struggles to define the band's style and influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's jazz and funk and folk music and Steely Dan and
probably Bruce Hornsby and lots of different people . . . It's
advanced singer-songwriter music,'' he says. ``I haven't been able
to come up with a name for what we are. The only thing I can do is
encourage you to listen and make up your own name. We don't sound
like anybody I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   All the members have limited commercial expectations, even
though they are releasing a debut album in late June. Crosby plans
on touring with CSN again and is putting the finishing touches on a
book and documentary called ``Stand and Be Counted,'' about the
charitable work of entertainers. Raymond, who recently worked as a
keyboardist on a Spice Girls TV special, is scoring a one-hour
drama for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   But when Crosby and Raymond are not playing together, they're
often with each other at their California homes. ``We live about a
45-minute flight (away) in a Cessna 182,'' says Crosby. Their wives
have grown close and so have their children. Raymond has a
3-year-old daughter, Grace, and Crosby a 3-year-old son, Django.
(He also has a grown daughter from a previous relationship.)
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to tell whether the children will also grow up to
become musicians, but the odds are probably with them. As Raymond
says of his musical links to Crosby, ``I think this makes a very
strong case for genetics.''

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ A far from colorblind criminal justice system is
turning a bad-enough black disproportion in crime into an even

   SAN ANTONIO _ As a new day unfolds on this neighborhood, a
Batman bedsheet hanging on a clothesline is blowing and billowing
in the wind. The smell of coffee and bacon and tortillas mingle
pleasantly as they float on an aromatic breeze. Sleepily, but
surely, the neighborhood comes alive.
</P>
<P>

Other women are walking their own children to day care.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man sits on his porch and watches as younger men,
clutching lunch pails or brown bags, head to work. A man jokes with
his son as he opens the car door for him while a pair of teen-agers
walks to a bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   Mornings in this neighborhood are like mornings in other
neighborhoods except for one significant difference. This
neighborhood is Victoria Courts and its mornings are numbered.

   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is forcing
the San Antonio Housing Authority to demolish the Victoria Courts
housing project and sell its 44 acres. All the residents, 660
families, will have to be relocated by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In the relocation lies the rub.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Courts, which was built in 1942, was never meant to be
a permanent home, just a temporary abode until the residents could
afford something better.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened with public housing projects in the United
States is what has happened in any neighborhood in any country in
any era where there is a high density of poverty and unemployment:
hopelessness sets in and breeds crime, juvenile delinquency, drug
use and other ills.
</P>
<P>
   A key to breaking the cycle of hopelessness is, as sociologist
William Julius Wilson has been writing for years, to disperse the
poor in quality subsidized housing throughout the city, including
the suburbs. The most important thing this does is put the poor in
areas where there are more and better jobs than in their previous
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The solution for Victoria Courts residents is to break up the
concentration of poverty and relocate residents to other
neighborhoods. Even better _ build subsidized single-dwelling homes
on Victoria Courts' 44 acres and allow some residents to return.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Courts has developed a reputation as one of the most
dangerous areas in San Antonio, a city of 1 million people. But its
residents see things others don't.
</P>
<P>
   Two summers ago I wrote an article on a photo project by some of
the children who lived in Victoria Courts. The photographs they
took revealed what they saw in their neighborhood. There were
photos of flowers, trees, pets, family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   They knew about the unpleasant parts of life in the courts, but
they focused their cameras on those things that made them feel
loved and connected to something.
</P>
<P>
   For all its problems and perceptions, Victoria Courts is a
neighborhood where people get up in the morning to go to work,
where neighbors share triumphs and sorrows and where children play
in the grass and dirt courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Few of us would choose to live there and may not understand why
those who do feel so strongly about having to leave. Actually, it's
quite simple: for now, at least, it is their home.

POWER TO THE PEDAL

 (For release Sunday, June 14)   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VERONICA FLORES  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ I'm not sure at what point in the middle of this
sure-to-be record-hot summer I decided that buying a mountain bike
was a great idea for outdoor recreation.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly wasn't after biting the dust the other day on one
of the rocky trails in Austin's Green Belt. Nor was it when I and a
friendly mountain biker who wouldn't let me fall behind briefly
lost the pack of bikers we were riding with _ at night, on the same
Green Belt, decidedly a spooky experience.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I remember now. The great idea must have hit me around the
time I wheeled my shiny new bicycle out of the bike shop earlier
this month. The sales clerks _ enthusiasts all _ had assured me it
would be, in mountain-bikespeak, a bad (expletive) experience.
Sleek black and that new-car smell emanating from the fat rubber
tires, the bicycle was to be my answer to boredom with the gym.
</P>
<P>
   One night ride on the treacherous Green Belt and several scrapes
and bruises later, that boredom is wiped out. Soon to be gone, too,
will be my ignorance about bicycling.
</P>
<P>
   My interest in the sport was piqued last month with San
Antonio's Bike Week. The week of activities was designed to promote
the sport and, more importantly, to encourage use of bicycles as an
alternative to air-dirtying motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The latter has moved to the forefront in recent years as this
South Texas city grapples with the issue of air quality.
</P>
<P>
   The first month in the bike seat has been hard _ literally _ for
someone who hadn't been on a bike in years. (Of course, if I could
back pedal, I probably wouldn't take my first trail ride at night
on the Green Belt. I must have had my helmet on too tight.)
</P>
<P>
   I have, however, gained a new perspective. And what I've seen so
far isn't encouraging for bicycle enthusiasts, particularly those
who dare to take to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers on the city's main streets navigate their vehicles at
our peril. They don't like to share the road, although it occurs to
me that some appear to do so simply because they don't know how
they should drive around bicyclists. I used to be guilty of that.
</P>
<P>
   Just share the space, that's all we ask. And, for heaven's sake,
signal before you make those turns. We're not mind-readers and we
have no desire to become road kill.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not all bad. I am finding the benefits of bicycling
outweigh the negatives _ namely, the exercise that the pastime can
provide. That's especially so for me as my neighborhood is dotted
with hills (OK, so maybe they're actually just gradual inclines)
that are just the right size for a beginner who wants to get a good
workout, but who doesn't have a death wish.
</P>
<P>
   The slower cruise through my neighborhood also has given me the
opportunity to check out streets and people who are tucked out of
sight and otherwise unseen to drivers in fast-moving cars.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find that in any gym. Besides, I figure I'd look
awfully silly wearing that helmet while sitting on a stationary
bike.
</P>

OLD-FASHIONED FUN IN `SIX DAYS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' is the kind of movie its creators
must have fallen in love with on the late show on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay that Michael Browning wrote for director Ivan
Reitman makes the Harrison Ford character a distillate of John
Wayne and Clark Gable, with a bit of Lee Marvin thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   The Anne Heche character is an amalgam of Irene Dunne, Katharine
Hepburn and Myrna Loy from an heiress-on-the-run story. The heiress
has been updated a bit. She's a ``career woman'' facing the
Rosalind Russell job-vs.-picket-fence dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   The romance of the story is basted to the
lost-on-an-uncharted-South-Seas-island pattern. Writer Browning has
seen 'em all, and he has taken notes.
</P>
<P>
   Robin (Heche) is an assistant editor for a Cosmo-like magazine
called Dazzle. Her boyfriend, Frank (David Schwimmer), whisks her
away to a romantic Polynesian resort, where he proposes marriage
and she accepts.
</P>
<P>
   But their idyll is interrupted. Robin is dispatched to Tahiti to
supervise a photo shoot. She hires a scruffy, hard-drinking charter
pilot named Quinn (Ford) and his scruffier monoplane. Both, Quinn
tells her, are ``old but sturdy.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn runs into the inevitable storm and must crash-land in the
inevitable uncharted island paradise.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the sort of person who thinks, ``Wait a minute, it's
1998 and there's an island that big and that pretty that doesn't
have a La Quinta and a Denny's?'' you may have a problem here.
You'll enjoy it more if you're the type who can extend romantic
license to the filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The process of the film is for the thrown-together twosome to
bicker and clinch, then bicker and clinch some more while avoiding
the island paradise's resident peril. In island movies of the past,
it has been cannibals. I had guessed the updating would make drug
runners the peril. I'll leave the discovery of the compromise to
you.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the emotional process of the narrative in this
sort of thing has been the plug horse (Ford) cutting the
thoroughbred (Heche) down to his size and her eventually liking it.
To that tradition these filmmakers have bowed _ make that
genuflected.
</P>
<P>
   Reitman uses his Hawaiian locations effectively, and his leading
players are certainly appealing. Heche is especially amusing at
slipping Robin back and forth between tough and girlish when she
senses which will be to her advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there is not quite enough narrative to spread over 97
minutes. But the film's utter predictability is offered as charm,
and the dialogue is reasonably happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Days'' offers a coy little exchange between Robin and
Quinn to acknowledge that during the shoot Ford became eligible at
many banks for free checking accounts because of his senior status.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn invites the 29-year-old Robin to guess his age. She starts
at a rosy 45. Quinn smiles crinkily and bids her up to 50.
Fifty?!?! Get out. So how old is he?
</P>
<P>
   And right there, lost on an uncharted island with no one around
but a movie camera, Quinn ...
</P>
<P>
   Go see for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights is rated PG-13, for language, sensuality
and brief violence.

THE COBAINS: A TABLOID VIEW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As ``Kurt &AMP; Courtney'' unfolds, it displays the gap between what
filmmaker Nick Broomfield promises and what he delivers, which is a
film that might more accurately have been titled ``Nick &AMP;
Courtney's Lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Courtney of both titles is Courtney Love, the Widow Cobain,
who was married to Kurt Cobain _ of the music group Nirvana _ when
Cobain was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who are not satisfied with the official
pronouncement that Cobain was a suicide; a cottage industry has
developed to serve these folks. The conspiracy theory with the most
sizzle points to the ambitious Widow Cobain as the holder of the
smoking (hired) gun.
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield is a British documentarist whose recent output has
boasted films about New York City sado-masochism clubs, a female
Florida serial killer and call-girl entrepreneur Heidi Fless.
</P>
<P>
   He is not, of course, the first filmmaker to put a
borderline-unethical title to one of his films. The ``Kurt &AMP;
Courtney'' title suggests that he set out to give us a portrait of
what he considers today's First Family of Rock, starting with his
subjects' tough-as-nails childhood years.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems that the first thing that Broomfield learned was
this: The principal difference between Courtney Before Kurt Died
and Courtney After Kurt Died is that this unpleasant and obscure
woman became an equally unpleasant but now famous woman with
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Likely because she learned Broomfield was soliciting information
from those who would depict her as a shrike _ her estranged father
entered the Kurt industry with a book concluding that his daughter
was quite capable of calling up a hit on her husband _ the Widow
Cobain began opposing the filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   With no access to members of Cobain's handlers or band, and
without license to the music controlled by Love, Broomfield was
compelled to make a film about how he was not able to do what he
wanted. In the process, he has been able to show off his First
Amendment stigmata.
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield, who carries his own tape recorder and boom mike,
makes himself the protagonist of this venture. He personally
records the corporate weasel who confides on the phone that a
Certain Someone has succeeded in cutting off the corporation's
backing of the film project.
</P>
<P>
   Documentaries like this have a way of turning me into a city
editor (worse: into a school of communications associate
professor), barking phrases like ``attribution'' and
``substantiation.'' I forget that a feature film is not a news
story, and viewers are probably less interested in the quality of
Broomfield's journalism and his ethics than whether the film is
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Provided you can get beyond the whiff of hypocrisy (Broomfield
wants us to think that he's swimming with stinkfish but he's not a
stinkfish himself), ``Kurt &AMP; Courtney'' is entertaining in a
tabloid-TV sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield is aware that in the United States legal protection
from libel decreases roughly in inverse proportion to ascending
fame. He'll put anybody in front of his camera who has something
negative to say about Courtney Love, provided it will grab our
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Love's father seems to revel in delivering enthusiastic payback
for his daughter's making him miserable during her adolescence.
Broomfield also tracks down a grotesquerie named El Duce _ we see a
clip of El Duce's garage video called ``I Want You to Be My Sex
Slave'' _ who says that the pre-Widow Cobain offered him $50K to
whack Cobain and ``I shoulda took it.'' El Duce was later struck
and killed by a train.
</P>
<P>
   But the bits remaining of the film that Broomfield seems to have
intended to make at the outset are more affecting.
</P>
<P>
   There are interviews with the high school principal who gave
Cobain shelter when he could abide neither of his parents; pictures
of the bridge under which Cobain slept; shots of Cobain's
despairing paintings; recordings of him singing at age 2; and
videotapes of him as a teen-ager, taken by his fond Aunt Mary.
</P>
<P>
   These are poignant moments that tend to convince us that,
contrary to everything else in the film, Cobain probably needed no
assistance in deciding to end his melancholy life.

HABITAT VOLUNTEERS TO BUILD ENERGY-EFFICIENT HOMES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Art available on NYT photo service) 
 
By MELANIE COFFEE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Habitat for Humanity is not just making houses
affordable for local families, it's trying to keep them that way.
</P>
<P>
   As a part of the 1998 Jimmy Carter Work Project, the
organization plans to build 100 homes for low-income families next
week _ all to be constructed under strict energy-efficient
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building our homes to be energy-efficient is the right thing
to do,'' said Michael Shirl, executive director of Houston Habitat
for Humanity. ``Our homes will allow our homeowners to save on
their utility bills, and to low-income families, that is additional
money they really need.''
</P>
<P>
   Two programs will join in making sure that Habitat for Humanity
meets its goals for the new houses in the Fifth Ward, a historic
African-American hub that fell on hard times between 1970 and 1990,
and areas in and around Magnolia Park, a neighborhood with a rich
Hispanic tradition that dates to about 1910.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Cents Homes program, offered through Houston Lighting &AMP;
Power Co., has been working with Habitat for Humanity since 1996 to
make its homes energy-efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 new houses will also be inspected under the federal
government's EnergySTAR program standards. Devised by the U.S.
Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, the
program certifies homes and products that help conserve energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Good Cents program and the EnergySTAR program are very
parallel,'' Shirl said. ``We belong to both because they are geared
towards energy efficiency, but the EnergySTAR takes their program a
little further.''
</P>
<P>
   To become certified under the Good Cents Program, each new house
will be inspected for efficient heating and cooling equipment,
caulking around the windows and air ducts and weather-stripping
around the doors to decrease the amount of wind that can leak into
a house, said Stacy Davis, Good Cents program accounts manager.
</P>
<P>
   Thick insulation will be installed in the walls and even thicker
insulation in the attics to help keep heat outside in the summer
and inside during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, double-paned windows will be tinted to help
deflect sunlight, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The new houses can be certified as energy-efficient after all
reports, including the findings by Good Cents, have been reviewed
by EnergySTAR program representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest thing about what Houston is doing is that people
will be able to see how successful EnergySTAR is at saving
energy,'' said Sam Rashkin, EnergyStar program director.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA blames household energy use for 20 percent of all carbon
dioxide emissions. If all U.S. households and businesses conformed
to EnergySTAR guidelines _ which include using energy-efficient
equipment and air ducts, high-performance windows and thick
insulation _ the reduction in gas emissions would be equivalent to
removing 21 million cars from the road.
</P>
<P>
   Shirl got the idea to promote energy-conserving houses for
Habitat for Humanity while working on his own home.
</P>
<P>
   Now Houston Habitat for Humanity is known for its high-quality,
energy-conserving homes. Last year, it won the Building Innovation
Award from the National Partners in Homeownership.

CARDS BRING HIGH-LEVEL GRAPHICS TO PRESENTATIONS ON TV SCREEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I do a great deal of PowerPoint presentations and I have to
use an overhead projector. A few years back I purchased a PC-to-TV
converter. The problem with this was that it would only handle the
lowest-resolution graphics available. Do you know of any way I can
use my PC and a TV as a monitor that will display the high level of
graphics that PowerPoint needs to be effective?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several graphics cards available now that feature
what's called TV-out. They will connect to either a monitor or a
TV, and the TV function is designed specifically for presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Canada-based ATI Technologies is the most prolific manufacturer
of these kinds of cards. At the high end is its All-in-Wonder and
All-in-Wonder Pro, two video boards that include 2-D and 3-D
graphics acceleration with a TV tuner and TV-out capabilities. They
start at about $170 and go up to $350, depending on the model and
the amount of memory installed.
</P>
<P>
   ATI also makes a low-end product, the 3D Xpression, with
PC-to-TV capabilities, that sells for about $120.
</P>
<P>
   STB Systems of Richardson also makes a TV-out version of its
popular Velocity 128 2-D/3-D accelerator. It sells for about $150.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you're interested in notebook computers with TV-out
capability, take a look at Compaq Computer Corp.'s Armada 4200
series.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure when you're shopping for any kind of PC-to-TV device
that you get one compatible with the television standards for the
countries you travel to. In the United States, for example, you'll
want one that's NTSC-compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a BIOS and how do I upgrade it?
</P>
<P>
   A: BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System, and it controls
the ground-level functions of a personal computer. For example,
when your PC boots up, it's the BIOS that begins the process that
pulls in the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The BIOS controls such basic things as screen display, the
keyboard, drives and serial ports. Other system components, both
hardware and software, work with the BIOS to improve the function
of these essential parts.
</P>
<P>
   The BIOS settings are stored in a chip on your system's main
board, and are usually held in memory by the power drawn from a
small battery. If you've owned a computer long enough, you've
probably had the unpleasant experience of having to reset your
system clock each time you boot up _ that's when that little
battery has gone dead. In some PCs, your system may no longer be
able to ``see'' your hard drives!
</P>
<P>
   You can change some of the functions of your BIOS. Check the
manual that came with your computer to see how to enter the BIOS
setup screen. In most cases, you'll need to hit a key just as your
system starts the boot process. On computers that use American
Megatrends BIOSes, for example, you hit the DEL key.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea to write down the settings in your BIOS before
you make any changes. Altering the BIOS is not kid stuff _ if you
don't know what you're doing, then don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   How the BIOS works is determined by software that is stored in
the chip. A modern BIOS chip is what's known as
``flash-upgradeable'' _ it can be altered by a program that's
designed to ``flash'' new instructions into it. If your BIOS is
like this, you can usually download a copy of the flash program
from the manufacturer's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's possible that you will have to replace the BIOS
chip itself in some older computers. And in much older systems, you
may not be able to make any changes at all.

PRODUCTS CREATED FOR THE DIGITAL ARTIST

<TEXT>
<P>
   Every copy of Windows comes with Paint, a modest little art
program that lets you both draw your own pictures and make changes
in images created by others. But ``modest'' is the key word here _
don't call on Paint to do any heavy artistic lifting.
</P>
<P>
   For that, you'll need software tools with a higher level of
sophistication. If you're serious about working with images and are
willing to spend some time learning the intricacies of these
programs, you can achieve some spectacular results.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at two software programs at two ends of the price
spectrum, and a low-cost drawing tablet you can use with either
one:
</P>
<P>
   _ Paint Shop Pro 5.0, $99, Jasc Software: If you've used
consumer software to work with images _ such as Adobe PhotoDeluxe
or Microsoft's PictureIt! _ and have been disappointed with the
lack of flexibility or power, Paint Shop Pro is worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   And doing so is a snap. A fully functional version is available

   Paint Shop Pro has long been considered an alternative to the
pricier Photoshop, but it's always been a step behind in
capabilities. Version 4.0, for example, lacked the ability to do
layers, a feature that lets you lay one image on top of another.
You can change one layer without affecting the rest of the image, a
powerful tool when combining pictures or going after special
effects.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Paint Shop Pro has been easier to use than
Photoshop, and its developers tried to automate tasks wherever they
could. For example, version 4.0 of Paint Shop Pro could
automatically create a shadow effect, something that had to be done
manually in Photoshop.
</P>
<P>
   This new version, though, brings Paint Shop Pro to near-parity
with Photoshop. It now includes the ability to do layers, albeit
with a simpler system than Photoshop.
</P>
<P>
   It also borrows from other programs, such as MetaTools' Fractal
Design Painter. It has nozzles that let you paint with specific
objects. For example, you can lay down a row of dice, cars,
airplanes, stars or any one of several dozen icons just by clicking
and dragging with your mouse. You can add others, too.
</P>
<P>
   Paint Shop Pro will read and save images in almost any popular
format, including Photoshop files.
</P>
<P>
   _ Photoshop 5.0, $995, Adobe Systems: This is the Cadillac of
photo-manipulation software _ and it's priced like a Caddy, too.
(If you're upgrading from earlier versions of Photoshop, or from
the ``light'' LE version, it's a lot cheaper _ in the $200-$300
range.) However, if you are a professional who works with digital
art, or someone who's adamant about having the best, there's really
no alternative. Photoshop is the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Version 5.0 is not a radical departure over 4.0. Instead,
developers have concentrated on making Photoshop _ which has a
notoriously steep learning curve _ easier to use. Many common
tasks, such as the aforementioned shadow creation, have finally
been automated.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe has tweaked some of the commonly used tools in Photoshop
to make them friendlier. For example, artists who wanted to
indicate the edge of an object in an image had to painstakingly
draw around those edges. Now, the pencil and lasso tools are
magnetic _ the program itself senses where the edges are and clings
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop 5.0 also has multiple undo capability, so you can move
backward through various changes you've made.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe also has greatly enhanced the text features of Photoshop.
Text now has its own type of layer, with its own capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pablo, $99, KidBoard: When it comes time to draw something,
nothing beats a pen and paper. But most computer users who aren't
professional artists still struggle with a mouse, a distinctly
clunky drawing device.
</P>
<P>
   Computer drawing tablets have been on the market for years, but
generally they've been priced out of reach of many consumers. Pablo
is the first quality drawing tablet aimed squarely at the home
market.
</P>
<P>
   Its drawing area is decently sized, at about 8 inches by 6
inches. An attached overlay of plastic lets you put images
underneath for tracing.
</P>
<P>
   The stylus can be attached by a cord on either side of the
table, making it comfortable for either right- or left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo comes with two great software titles _ MetaTools Dabbler,
a drawing program that's a subset of the higher-end Fractal Design
Painter, and Kai's Power Goo LE, a ``light'' version of the popular
photo-distortion program.
</P>
<P>
   Using Pablo is simple. Just press a button on the stylus to
activate it. With art programs designed to work with a tablet _ and
all the titles mentioned here will _ the effects are similar to
using a real pen, brush or marker. The longer and harder you press
down, the darker and more pronounced the image will be on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Dabbler is particularly good for this, because, like Fractal
Design Painter, it emulates ``natural'' media, such as chalk,
charcoal or even crayons.
</P>
<P>
   If you are used to drawing with a mouse, it may take a while to
get the hang of drawing on a tablet and getting the results you
want. But once you master Pablo, it will be difficult to go back.

`KILLING THE DREAM' PILES UP EVIDENCE AGAINST RAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the last 30 years, millions of Americans have refused to
believe a racist hillbilly and prison escapee could plot the murder
of a national leader, and successfully spend two months on the lam
before being apprehended in London.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion has been fueled by conspiracy theorists, who in turn
were led on by James Earl Ray, who after pleading guilty to killing
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., would spend nearly three decades
seeking to overturn his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Killing the Dream: James Earl Ray and the Assassination of
Martin Luther King Jr.,'' author and investigative reporter Gerald
Posner presents what is in essence a biography of the assassin.
</P>
<P>
   Posner takes readers on an unsettling journey through the
underbelly of American life. His book recounts the hardscrabble
poverty and brutality of Ray's upbringing, brings us into the
whorehouses where the assassin satisfied his sexual desires, and
visits flophouse after flophouse.
</P>
<P>
   The book shows how an inhabitant of such a world can be
mean-clever, accomplished at using aliases, and able to concoct
stories to cover his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Posner has exhaustively tracked Ray, however. He is convinced it
was this man, perhaps pursuing a bounty offered by rich
segregationists, who murdered King. He piles up the evidence that
the killer acted alone. The perennial loser was just lucky enough
to find King leaning over a balcony at the Lorraine Motel in
Memphis. The apostle of non-violence was a perfect target.
</P>
<P>
   If Ray had not spotted two police cars, when walking briskly
from the scene of the murder, he may never have been caught. He
dropped a bundle containing the murder weapon. His fingerprints
were found on the rifle, its telescopic sight, binoculars and two
other items.
</P>
<P>
   Posner is at his best when debunking conspiracy theorists. He
blows hole after hole in Ray's longstanding alibi about being set
up by a mystery man named ``Raoul.'' The book's climax comes when
Ray's defenders find a retired auto worker in New Jersey whose name
matches one of the fantasy leads.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the poor man, an immigrant from Portugal, had never
been anywhere else in the United States except for a brief
work-related trip to Portland, Ore. Suddenly he finds his home
staked out by ``investigators'' and the trash news media.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy theories get mixed. At one point, an investigator
tells Ray's attorney, William Pepper, ``We can tie him (Raoul) into
the Kennedy assassination a lot better than the Martin Luther King
assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' Pepper yells. ``We can't say that. That would ruin
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, conspiracy buffs charge that King was really
assassinated by Army Special Forces troops. The leader of the
covert team is identified as a Captain Billy R. Eidson. Eidson is
conveniently listed as dead, and hence removed from questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The theory takes off, moving from Montel Williams' TV show to a
Court TV program with Johnnie Cochrane. Quietly, retirees in the
Special Forces Association track down Eidson. He is very much
alive. It turns out he was never in Memphis. On the day of the
assassination, Eidson was on duty with the Birmingham, Ala., fire
department.
</P>
<P>
   The dishonest, duplicitous behavior of Ray's defenders takes the
breath away, as does the gullibility of King's family. The son of
the slain civil rights leader, Dexter King, meets with Ray in
prison and proclaims his innocence. The TV cameras roll.
</P>
<P>
   Ray died recently. He can lie no more. Still, as Posner
relentlessly documents, the business of fabricating and marketing
conspiracies has found quite a market.
</P>
<P>
   In Ray's case, a special House committee on assassinations
probed his alibi in the late 1970s and revealed its multiple
falsehoods. But that did not keep the BBC from producing a sloppy
``documentary'' on British TV that exonerated the killer. Thames TV
of Britain, and Home Box Office, would pay $140,000 to Ray's lawyer
to ``investigate the case,'' and staged a mock trial at which Ray
was found not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, incidentally, the role of prosecutor was played by
one Hickman Ewing Jr., a former U.S. attorney from Tennessee. The
same Hickman Ewing is today a top deputy to Whitewater special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr, who has spent four years and consumed $35
million of the taxpayers' money on an investigation that has yet to
prove a single conspiracy.

PSYCHOLOGIST ASSURES MOMS THAT PARENTING IS NO WALTZ FOR ANYONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LYNN STEINBERG  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's true. Misery loves company. So when
``relationship expert'' Harriet Lerner admits to being a
less-than-perfect parent _ acknowledges that ``when I get angry
enough, intense enough, I have the brain of a reptile'' _ we take
comfort in knowing we're not alone, that given the right set of
circumstances, the best of parents can behave like lunatics.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner recounts times when, in the heat of a fight, her younger
son, Ben, would glare at her and say: ``How can you write about
relationships? Just look at you.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lerner, a psychologist and author, reminds us in her newest
book that when it comes to raising children, logic often eludes us
and no amount of training can adequately prepare us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mother Dance,'' (HarperCollins, 319 pages, $25) draws on
research, case studies and Lerner's own experience as a parent and
therapist to paint an authentic, engaging and occasionally
hilarious portrait of motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   There are no instructions on how to do it right. Just a
refreshingly real look at the ways in which children change a
woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner, author of the best seller ``The Dance of Anger,''
initially set out to do a book on parenting, but was dissuaded by
the thousands of volumes already written on the subject. As she
combed the bookshelves, she said, she noticed ``a conspicuous
silence on the mother's experience of having kids and how her life
and relationships are transformed when children enter the
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   She welcomed the opportunity to revisit her own experiences, now
that her two sons are grown, and to take a stab at what she calls
``the false sentimentality'' surrounding the institution of
motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Raising children can bring a woman untold joy and happiness. But
it can also evoke in us a dark side we never knew we had.
</P>
<P>
   At times like those, Lerner likes to remember the words of
novelist Fay Weldon, who observed that ``the greatest advantage of
not having children must be that you can go on believing that you
are a nice person: Once you have children, you realize how wars
start.''
</P>
<P>
   That Lerner's book contains ample evidence of her own blundering
is part of its charm. Here is a therapist, a woman who has spent
her entire career writing about and counseling people in
dysfunctional families, feeling her way along and occasionally
foundering, just like the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   At first Lerner's editor questioned whether it was wise to
reveal too much about her own relationships, whether sharing openly
about her vulnerability and bad-mother days might undermine her
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my other books,'' she explained, ``I come across as a
highly evolved, clear-thinking mature person who would sail through
every phase of her child's development with perfect clarity and
calm, like a saint or a highly evolved Buddhist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lerner felt strongly that mothers need to hear other mothers
talking openly and honestly about the good, the bad and the
unspeakable. ``We need this even more than expert advice,'' she
said, ``though we need that too. When kids come along, we need all
the help we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   So early on in the book, we meet Lerner in the middle of the
night, in the seventh month of a complicated and potentially
disastrous first pregnancy, looking for some way to explain the wet
bedsheets, not wanting to believe that her water could have broken,
that her baby could be this early.
</P>
<P>
   She describes she and her husband, Steve, also a therapist,
``crouched like dogs on our bed, noses to the sheet, coming up for
air only long enough to fight with each other about whether we were
or were not smelling pee.''
</P>
<P>
   When they finally agreed that Lerner had indeed gone into labor,
they rushed to the hospital where their son Matthew was born,
premature but healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner said it was during this first and difficult pregnancy
that she learned the basic lessons of motherhood: ``That we are not
in control of what happens to our children, but that this fact
needn't stop us from feeling totally guilty and responsible; that
matters of life and death turn on a dime; and that most of what we
worry about doesn't happen, although bad things happen that we fail
to anticipate.''
</P>
<P>
   As her children grew, she also learned humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I had kids,'' she said, ``I was amazed at the improper
behavior of other mothers and I knew I would never do any of those
things. I would never yell at the kids, I would never fight with
Steve within earshot of my children, I would never feed them at
McDonald's and I wasn't going to be a worrier. My mother was a
worrier and I wasn't going to be that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I did all those things _ and more.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, she and her husband never fly together because she
fears the plane will crash and her grown boys will be left without
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' she writes, ``we mothers need to honor our
worries even when we can't justify them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, the issue Lerner wrestled with most was setting
clear rules for her children and imposing consequences when they
were broken. It seemed like such a simple thing _ before she became
a mother.
</P>
<P>
   But when her boys fought with each other in the car or refused
to pick up their dishes from the living-room, she was rendered
helpless.
</P>
<P>
   She describes hitting rock bottom during a protracted struggle
with her son Ben, when he was a teenager oblivious to the mess in
his midst.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if a fog descended on her brain, she said, and
dissolved her thinking center. Her inability to function well in
those situations was in stark contrast to the clarity she
experienced with adults when she was in conflict, and she remains
at a loss to explain the difference.
</P>
<P>
   A chapter in the book on worrying, titled ``Will Your Child
Become a Serial Killer,'' has an eerie ring in an age when armed
children burst into schools, killing other children.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner recognizes that bringing a child into the world is an
enormous leap of faith, but she cautions that there are ``no good
old days to return to, even if we could.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Each generation has its own particular crises and its own
particular strengths,'' she said. ``I would not have wanted to
raise a child when my mother did, when divorce was not an option no
matter how empty or conflictual a marriage, when there was so much
solitude and secrecy, when no one knew the terrible things going on
in other people's homes or their own for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   She describes in her book a couple she saw in therapy, beginning
when their only child was 6 and suddenly adverse to going to
school. The little girl had long been the focal point of conflicts
between her parents over how best to raise her, and those arguments
fed into a destructive cycle. The more the parents fought over her
care, the more troubled she became. The more problems she
exhibited, the more her parents fought.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is most important to know about this family is how
ordinary it is,'' Lerner writes. ``... In the life cycle of a
normal family, something will get terribly screwed up with at least
one of your kids. If this doesn't happen to you, well, you're just
some kind of weird exception to the rule, or very lucky, or in
denial, or your time hasn't come yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lerner sat down to write the last chapter of her book, the
one on the empty nest, her younger son was leaving home for
college.
</P>
<P>
   She missed him terribly, far more than she imagined she would.
She ached for the feel of him, for the smell of him. So she dug out
a dirty old T-shirt from the bottom of his closet and wore it every
morning while she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, her house in Topeka, Kan., still feels empty without
her boys. ``But the paradox is, as much as I miss them, I wouldn't
want them to move back,'' Lerner said. ``I'm ready for this new
stage of development.''

SHANIA TWAIN SHALL MEET HER LEGIONS OF FANS ON FIRST NATIONAL
TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been more than three years since Shania Twain launched her
career with the feisty singles ``Who's Bed Have Your Boots Been
Under?'' and ``Any Man of Mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Twain says she isn't even a teeny bit worried about the
start of her first national concert tour, a milestone that could
make any performer weak in the knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling great and I'm ready,'' Twain said by phone from
her home in Lake Placid, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what people may not understand is that I've been
performing in front of audiences for a long, long time, but on a
smaller scale. So I'm actually getting back into my comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Twain, a native of Ontario, Canada, began singing at about age
6. She made her nightclub debut at 8 when her father pulled her out
of bed one night to sing at a local club after the nightly liquor
curfew.
</P>
<P>
   Before she was 21, Twain opened a concert by Bernadette Peters
and the Toronto Symphony. In 1993, she recorded her first album,
which included the single ``God Ain't Gonna Getcha for That.''
</P>
<P>
   Twain's career has been on fire ever since she met her husband,
rock producer Robert John ``Mutt'' Lange, in 1993. Lange has worked
with Def Leppard, Michael Bolton, AC/DC, Foreigner and Bryan Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things I've been most successful with over the last four
years have been the television appearances and the studio stuff,
like my records,'' Twain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the irony of that is that those are the things I'm the
most awkward with and that I had no experience with at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The first leg of Twain's tour, which opened May 29 in Sudbury,
Ontario, includes a concert with fellow Canadian group Saturday
night at the Tacoma (Wash.) Dome. The tour continues through the
summer of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Twain said the biggest challenge in launching a first-time tour
was living up to her fans' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to ask myself, `Is the show spectacular enough and
exciting enough and entertaining enough for my fans?' And I'm
confident that it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked on it for several months now and I've been very
hands-on since day one with the lighting, staging, the musicians
and every little thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehearsals for the tour, which will feature a nine-piece band,
began last month in Lake Placid. Fans recently snapped up tickets
to a warmup show at the Lake Placid Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tickets sold out the first morning,'' Twain said, sounding
surprised. ``I was expecting to at least fill the floor, but we
were way beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the goals in recording her current album, ``Come On
Over,'' was to come up with additional songs suitable for her tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I aimed for the kind of stuff that fans enjoyed the most on
the last album, like `I'm Outta Here' and `Any Man of Mine,' ''
Twain said.
</P>
<P>
   The songs on ``Come Over Over'' are also a lot more personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a natural thing to do. These days, I feel more
comfortable and confident writing about my own personality and my
own perspective on things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come On Over'' includes two message songs _ ``If You Want to
Touch Her, Ask,'' a song about adolescent awkwardness and respect;
and ``Black Eyes, Blue Tears,'' about regaining one's self-esteem
after leaving an abusive relationship.
</P>
<P>
   `` `If You Want to Touch Her, Ask' really comes from my early
teen years, a time when the boundaries really hadn't been set
between boy and girl,'' Twain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a stage that probably most girls do. When
you're developing physically, you feel very awkward. And guys
either find those things funny or are really embarrassed if they're
caught looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the song based on that, but turned it into something
far more positive. It's a song about mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for her feisty, fist-pumping songs, Twain longs for the
hard-hitting messages of many older country songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think I'm bringing to country isn't something that's
new to country but something that's left country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to write songs with more direct lyrics, like
Johnny Paycheck's `Take This Job and Shove It.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Country music used to be much more controversial than it is
now. We've gone into this serious, politically correct stage that
artistically I find very, very restrictive.''
</P>
<P>
   Twain and Lange are one of modern country's most successful
husband-and-wife teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship kind of intertwines naturally,'' she said.
``When you're in love and have an intimate relationship you can be
open about your thoughts and that translates into creative things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid to share our stupid ideas with each other.
You have of allow yourself to be vulnerable to truly expose
something that could be brilliant. That happens with us a lot.''

BONE MARROW REGISTRY: IT'S A CANCER SURVIVOR'S WISH LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Customer service trainer Jack Chandler of AirTouch Cellular in
Bellevue, Wash., was 34 when he discovered, by accident, that he
had an 8-inch tumor wedged between his heart and lungs.
</P>
<P>
   He'd just finished a touch football game with friends and
thought he had broken a rib. When he went in for X-rays, he came
out with a grim diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was advanced and spreading
fast. Until that point, he didn't even know he was sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lymphoma is one of the least curable forms of cancer,''
Chandler said. ``My doctor didn't say, `You don't have much of a
chance,' but I could tell by the way he was going through the
motions he didn't think I'd last much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in November 1994. In May 1996, after chemotherapy and
radiation failed to keep him in remission, he discovered that a
bone marrow transplant was his only hope for survival.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. ``I wouldn't be alive if I had not had a bone marrow
transplant,'' Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chandler and his wife, Lisa, also an AirTouch employee, are
trying to make sure that more people get the life-saving
opportunity of a bone marrow transplant. Yesterday, they
spearheaded a bone marrow drive at the company's regional
headquarters in Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   They would have been pleased if 30 people had showed up.
Instead, the response was overwhelming and they had to extend the
drive. When everyone is finally registered, they expect to have
added more than 150 names to the registry.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pair hope to challenge other AirTouch offices around the
country to take part.
</P>
<P>
   There are already 3.2 million potential marrow donors in the
nation, including about 36,000 in Washington. But more donors are
needed, especially members of minorities, who are underrepresented
in the registry.
</P>
<P>
   The registry is critical because only about 30 percent of cancer
patients can find bone marrow matches within their own families.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was one of the lucky ones. Three of his siblings
matched, which is almost unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows that not everyone has that same chance. The odds of
two unrelated people finding a match on the registry are about 80
percent overall, but only 30 percent to 40 percent for
African-American patients, and less for some other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about 8 percent of registered donors are African
American, about 1 percent are Native American, and the balance are
Hispanic and Asian American.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow transplants are often the last hope for cancer
patients with lymphoma, breast cancer, leukemia and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate drives can be a huge help in building the registry.
Yet, while many companies sponsor corporate blood drives, bone
marrow drives are less common. The Puget Sound Blood Center and
Program, which maintains the registry in Western Washington, does
about 1,000 corporate blood drives a year, but only five or six
corporate bone marrow drives a year, spokesman Keith Warnack said.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow drives are less frequent in part because people have
the misconception that signing up for the registry involves a
painful bone marrow procedure, Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't. Registering only involves giving a small sample of
blood, no more of an ordeal than a normal blood donation.
</P>
<P>
   The uncomfortable part, actually donating the marrow, only
happens if a patient happens to match.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, given the chance to save someone's life, don't mind
the little bit of pain involved, Chandler said. He likened it to
the soreness you get if you fall on your tailbone.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate drives help educate people about the need for bone
marrow donors, Warnack said. They're also helpful for building the
registry, because the companies usually pay the $40 registration
fee for each non-minority donor who signs up. (The cost of
registering minority donors is covered by federal grants.)
</P>
<P>
   Warnack also encourages companies to consider paying an extra
$30 a person to have each donor's tissue typed completely. The $40
pays for an initial level of testing, called A-B matching, that
allows for a rough match of patients and donors. For $70, the
tissue will be typed to the D-R level, which enables a match to be
made much more quickly, Warnack said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of which way they go, Chandler hopes more companies
will do drives of their own.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have to take a sick employee to get people involved,
he said. ``I can't think of a more worthwhile drive than one that
so directly affects whether someone lives or dies.''

   &UR; EDITORS: In honor of Father's Day on June 21, The New York Times
Syndicate looks at the changing institution of fatherhood from many
perspectives. We examine the conflicts men face balancing work and
family, and the trend toward becoming fathers in middle age. We
offer two essays by dads anticipating Father's Day: one nostalgic
and one humorous. And for those dads who love to hit the links, Jim
McKay picks his ten top golfers.

</P>
<P>
   Much is written about the struggles of working women balancing
work and family. But what about the working dad? In the 1990s, more
and more fathers want to play a significant role in rearing their
children, but the workplace is not always so accommodating. Levine
and Pittinsky describe how a father's work affects his family and
vice versa, and offer suggestions on how to achieve a better
balance. (slugged:

   As many women have children later in life and divorced men
remarry and have second families, many men in theIR late 40s, 50s
and 60s are finding themselves the fathers of newborns. They may
get mistaken for grandfathers, but this new breed of fathers brings
a fresh new perspective to fatherhood, the authors say, often
valuing their children as much or even more than work. But older
fathers also face doubts about whether it's fair to raise a young
child at an advanced age. (slugged:

   This Father's Day, Herrera's children have asked him to take
them to see ``Godzilla.'' The request evokes memories of his own
childhood, when he and his dad would go to the movies on Father's
Day, a rare time for them to be together, just the two of them.
``The time a child spends alone with his or her father is special.
Too often it's taken for granted by both parent and child,''
Herrera says. (slugged:

   Lying in bed before dawn on Father's Day, Applegate dreams of
sneaking out for a quick round of golf. He alternates between
musings about life as a golf pro and counting the blessings in his
own life. Good sense prevails: ``There are those Sundays when
abandoning your family to play golf is maybe just a little sick.

   &UR; By MARTIN CARNOY AND DAVID CARNOY &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (From ``Fathers of a Certain Age'') &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It is Saturday morning, 6:30 a.m., and a faint light is
beginning to creep through the blinds of the master bedroom where
two figures are sleeping peacefully in their queen-sized bed.
Suddenly, they hear the creaking of a door hinge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the figures in the bed stirs, turning over onto his back.
This is Adam, who, somewhere in his confused semi-consciousness,
feels a weight on his body and then his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy,'' a tiny voice says next to his ear, ``it's time to get
up. It's light out.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam groans, his eyes still closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to sleep, honey,'' he manages to say. ``It's
nighttime.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, still without moving, not addressing anyone in particular:
``Can't you do something about this? I'm 54 years old and there's a
child sitting on my head at 6:30 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam says that on mornings like these, he feels as if he's
living in a lost episode of ``The Twilight Zone.'' He is a member
of a fast-growing group of men who are fathering in their late 40s,
50s and even 60s. At a time when they should be basking in the
midafternoon sun of lives well lived, these men are raising young
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mornings when I'll wake up _ I most likely, get
awakened,'' says Adam, ``and I'll say to myself, where the hell am
I? And who's this insane person in my body who's doing this? And
then I realize, it's me. I'm the insane person.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he's had his morning coffee, that attitude has begun
to improve. And by midafternoon _ the time he usually takes his son
to the park _ he feels quite good about himself and the decision
he's made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, but I don't see myself as any older than those
guys over there,'' he tells us, pointing to a couple of men in
their early 30s playing with their children nearby. ``Sure, at some
level I know I look like Alex's grandfather, and sometimes I catch
strange looks, but in my mind's eye, I'm no different than they are
_ just another father in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam is typical of these fathers ``of a certain age.'' They have
always been around, but now there seem to be a lot more of them.
They are the grayheads standing in line at the supermarket or the
folks you mistake for grandparents at the local nursery school.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid increase of middle-aged fathers and the growing _ and,
many would say, inappropriate _ interest in fathering relatively
late in a man's life are mainly the result of delayed childbearing
by many professional women and the rise in the divorce rate. And
technology has made it much more possible today for older women _
and their older husbands _ to have children even if the wife is not
significantly younger than the husband.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds like fun _ older men finding new meaning in life
and women attaining professional success first and then having
families, too.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that it is such a good thing. Those who
object see older parents as acting selfishly, against the interest
of the children they choose to parent. They do not find the
grayheads with preschoolers cute. For many Americans, middle-aged
parents are just one more symbol of the decay of traditional values
and the growing selfishness that puts misplaced self-satisfaction
ahead of the greater social good.
 &UR; THE GREAT MORAL DEBATE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter is an everyday miracle,'' a friend in his 50s
tells us, smiling. Steve has three grown children, all boys, from
his first marriage, and a girl, age 2, from his second.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take the incredible gift of a child for granted when
you are in late middle age,'' Steve goes on. ``The unfolding of
life has to be savored _ observed carefully, contemplated and
understood _ when your own mortality confronts you daily in the
unforgiving reality of the early morning mirror. My attachment to
my daughter also has an immediacy and unconditionality that seems
more like what mothers are supposed to feel. I have discovered real
parenting skills, the ones I was too busy to work on when I was
climbing the so-called ladder of economic and social success.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve and others who are fathering second families tend to talk
a lot about the difference in feelings and commitment they have
this second time around. Fathers in their late 40s, 50s and beyond
tend to value children as much as their work, and often more. They
seem to spend more time with their children than younger fathers.
Some have retired from the working world completely and take on
roles as stay-at-home parents while their younger wives go to
full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the intensity of later fatherhood, the new role is
not easy. The self-indulgence of late middle age bumps against the
energies of a new life demanding attention. Even if an older father
may not be as concerned with competing at work, and much more
concerned with discovering his emotions, he often wants to focus on
himself, his wife, his children from an earlier marriage or his
grandchildren _ all of which can be tough competition against the
needs of his still-young child.
</P>
<P>
   One older father, Larry, was talking to the wife of an old
friend when the conversation turned abruptly to older parents. The
woman was obviously disturbed by the notion that Larry and other
men her husband's age are fathering young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine Alan (her son) today, at 27,'' she said, quite
agitated, ``if he had been born to a father in his 50s. Suppose his
father had even lived that long, he would be 80. Could a man 80
years old provide the emotional support that a typical kid like
Alan still needs in his 20s? Could that same father at 70 have had
any meaningful connection with a teenager?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it,'' she said. ``More likely, Alan would now have to
be taking care of an old man with serious health problems. I don't
think kids in their 20s are ready to do that. They should not have
to do it. They should be free to think about themselves. God knows,
the ego trip ends soon enough, why make them take on the worry of
aging parents when they should be exploring life?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what it is to lose a parent when you are
young,'' she continued, getting angrier. ``I lost my mother when I
was 21, and I never got over it. It is devastating and unfair.
Sure, it happens even when you are born to young parents like I
was. But fathers who start in their 50s stand a good chance of
dying before their kids are 20. You may not like that idea, but it
is true. It leaves a tremendous void.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry says the conversation shook him to the core.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I irresponsible in having a child so late in life?'' he
worries. ``Do children who have older parents and lose them
prematurely suffer a harm that makes the whole enterprise pure
self-gratification? I realized that in the decision around this
child, neither my wife or I had given much thought to whether I
would be alive at 75 or what I would be like in my 60s as our then
teenager confronted puberty and high school. Our main concerns had
been around our own lifestyle and how it would have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he thought about it further, Larry realized that having a
father at age 50 or even 35 as a normal turn of events is a recent
phenomenon. His own father was 33 when Larry's grandfather died a
``normal'' death at 62, and this grandfather was 34 when his father
died in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if a man reaches 50, he will, on average, live past 80.
True, there is still a good chance that, if he is an older father,
his child will lose him in his or her 20s, at a time when many
children are still emotionally and financially dependent on their
fathers. But there is an even better chance that the father will be
there for the child's wedding and the grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Larry also contemplated the quality of the relationship with his
young child. Older parents know that they risk making their
children face a father's ``early'' death. Yet they also know that
they can give their child a higher material standard of living,
more father time, perhaps a higher quality of the father's time and
probably a more stable marital relationship during the years the
father is present.
</P>
<P>
   When we ask Larry about this conundrum, he is still not sure
what the right answer is. But he does feel that he has probably
spent a lot more time thinking about parenting than younger parents
do _ certainly more than when he had fathered his first child at
the age of 27.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Larry seems to have settled, at least in his own mind,
that he is doing the right thing.

   ``Before I leave work, I call my wife to ask what our 5-year-old
son, Will, has been up to,'' says Michael Johnson, a general
manager at a printing company in Portland, Maine. ``Then when I
come home, I can tap right into Will's world. I'll say, `I hear you
were running around with an eye patch playing pirate today.' It
lets him know I have been thinking of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnson, more fathers today are making a connection between
their work life and their family life. Nearly 70 percent of working
men say that family is just as important as their job, or more
important, according to a national Roper Organization survey. As a
result, many working dads are struggling to find the balance that
was once thought to be only a mother's problem.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 46 percent of fathers today say they don't spend enough
``quality time'' with their children. And when they're unable to do
this, 78 percent of men say they feel guilty, according to a survey
of nearly 350 parents conducted at Ohio's University of Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   So in these times, it's no longer enough to simply ask whether a
working mother hurts her kids by being away from them most of the
day. We now also need to address the brand-new question: What are
the consequences for families _ and businesses _ when fathers work?
</P>
<P>
   For years, it's been a fact of life that dads' jobs typically
take them away from their children for more than eight hours a day.
It's been through their work, through being good economic
providers, that fathers have established their very identities and
taken care of their families.
</P>
<P>
   So it never occurred to families or employers that business
should do anything _ aside from providing a paycheck _ to support
men as fathers. After all, why would it matter? Weren't work and
family separate worlds?
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems to be a resounding no. Over the past two
decades, a new wave of research on child and family development,
which had previously focused nearly exclusively on mothers, has
begun to document the vital role that fathers play in their
children's lives. This has led to a revolutionary understanding of
working dads: A man's dual roles as father and worker have an
enormous impact on each other.
 &UR; HOW WORK AFFECTS FAMILY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are the unseen stakeholders in the American workplace,''
says Stewart Friedman, director of the Wharton Life Interests
Project at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
``Fathers' work is an unseen and underappreciated influence on
children's development.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some surprising ways that a father's work has impact,
positive or negative, on his kids.
</P>
<P>
   + When fathers are satisfied with their jobs, their children
have fewer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman and Jeffrey Greenhaus, professor of management at
Drexel University in Philadelphia, found that children ages 4 to 17
whose fathers say they are satisfied with their work exhibit fewer
behavioral problems such as shyness, withdrawal and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a dad is able to sit at the dinner table and talk about
his work with a positive attitude, confidence and pride, that seems
to rub off on his kids,'' Friedman says.
</P>
<P>
   + Too many or too few work hours affect children's learning and
development.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 3-to-6-year-old children undertaken at Ohio State
University in Columbus, sociologists Toby Parcel and Elizabeth
Menaghan, the authors of ``Parents' Jobs and Children's Lives''
(Aldine De Gruyter, 1994), found that a father's unemployment may
be linked to increased behavior problems such as whining, hitting
and acting out. Conversely, working sustained overtime _ not just
putting in occasional long hours _ may also have a negative effect
on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, vocabulary will not be as developed,'' Parcel observes.
</P>
<P>
   When Dad is around, on the other hand, there are big benefits
for kids, numerous studies show. For example, at 6 months of age,
babies with actively involved fathers score higher on an
intellectual ability test, according to a study by F.A. Pederson,
author of the ``The Father-Infant Relationship'' (Praeger, 1980).
</P>
<P>
   And for girls, feeling competent in math is linked to a close
and warm relationship with their fathers, according to studies at
the University of Michigan School of Social Work in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   + How a boss treats a father can affect how a father treats his
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis-based art director Jeff Lovell, who has custody of
his three children, often has to come in late to work for family
reasons. Fortunately, he has a supportive boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be able to stay with the company,'' Lovell says,
``if they didn't trust that I'll always get the work done.''
</P>
<P>
   And that kind of autonomy on the job leads to higher self-esteem
for a dad, according to researcher Karen Grimm-Thomas of
Pennsylvania State University in University Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's likely that when parents see themselves succeed at work,
they feel more confident as parents,'' she says. ``And they are
clearer about what they expect from their children, too.''
 &UR; HOW FAMILY AFFECTS WORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do businesses value a man for being a good dad _ and show it in
their policies?
</P>
<P>
   Not as often as dads would like. Flextime is rarely an option.
Paternity leave is rarely paid. And since men typically continue to
earn more than women, it is usually not financially feasible for a
father to take an unpaid leave even if a company offers it.
</P>
<P>
   But good managers are at least beginning to recognize the
interdependence of work and family.
</P>
<P>
   At Corning Inc. in Corning, N.Y., manager Ed O'Brien lets his
employees define their own schedules. And he values the expertise
good parents bring with them to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empathy, listening skills, knowing how to teach others and how
learning takes place _ all of these child-rearing practices are
directly applicable to the workplace,'' O'Brien says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a father who just returned to his job as a purchasing
agent after taking paternity leave says that caring for his
4-month-old has given him a whole new way of listening to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look more closely for nonverbal signals now,'' he says,
``and I can use this skill when I'm talking with colleagues and
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   When a company is sensitive to a father's family
responsibilities, dads want to keep working there. Mike Dedek, a
software engineer and father of three who works at Lexis-Nexis in
Miamisburg, Ohio, says, ``My dedication to this company is
primarily due to their family friendliness.''
</P>
<P>
   When a company's policies and programs take family needs into
account, employees are 45 percent more likely to ``go the extra
mile'' for their employer, say researchers at Dupont in Wilmington,
Del.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do these kinds of programs increase worker dedication,
but, as consultant Richard Federico of William Mercer Inc. in New
York observes, ``When people are less stressed out, they tend to
produce better on the job.''
 &UR; ACHIEVING A BETTER BALANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How can you ease your own work-and-family juggling act,
especially when you may not have the most enlightened of bosses?
Here are some strategies.
</P>
<P>
   + Ask, don't assume.
</P>
<P>
   Think your bosses will never allow any adjustment in work
schedule, or that they'd interpret a family obligation as a lack of
commitment to the job? If so, you might actually cheat yourself of
what you need.
</P>
<P>
   One father was hesitant to ask his supervisor if he could stay
home with his son, who wasn't feeling well, so his wife took time
off from her own job. The next day his boss _ a working parent
herself _ happened to ask how things were going at home. When he
mentioned that his wife was at home with their sick child, the boss
said, ``Why don't you do your work at home if you need to?''
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story: If you don't ask for what you need, you
won't get it.
</P>
<P>
   + Frame your request in terms of work.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss doesn't have to hear every detail of a family problem.
He or she just needs to be convinced that, in an emergency, you
have a plan for getting your work done, such as doing it at home or
having a colleague cover for you.
</P>
<P>
   + Use your human resources department.
</P>
<P>
   HR professionals today often receive special training in helping
employees negotiate sticky work/family issues. So, again, ask for
help.
</P>
<P>
   + Turn down extra work with business savvy.
</P>
<P>
   As downsizing leads to bigger workloads, it's increasingly
important to know how to turn down work that might compromise your
family's needs.
</P>
<P>
   One way is to present your boss with options for reprioritizing
your work: ``I'll be able to take on this assignment if I give up
some other stuff on my plate. Can we review my assignments and see
what I might delay doing, or perhaps delegate to someone else?''
</P>
<P>
   + Find strength in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having work/family problems, it's likely that your
fellow employees are, too. Chris Colbern, who supervises payroll
services at Cigna, a Philadelphia-based insurance company, gathered
a group of co-workers together to look at how other companies had
implemented flextime. The result: a new Cigna scheduling system
that virtually all employees prefer.
</P>
<P>
   It may not yet be the law of the land, but a member of the
nation's highest court is recognizing dads' family needs. In 1994,
shortly after her appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was asked why she agreed to a flexible schedule
for law clerk David Post, who was attending Georgetown University
at night. His wife, an economist, had a demanding job, so Post
needed to care for their children during part of each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my dream of the way the world should be,'' Ginsburg
said. ``I was so pleased to see that there are indeed men who are
doing a parent's work, who do not regard that as strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like David, I hope, will be role models for other men
who may be fearful they won't succeed in their profession if they
spend time caring for their children or are concerned they will be
thought of as less than a man if family is of prime importance.''

 &HT;    
 By JOE APPLEGATE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It is 5 a.m. on Father's Day, and you have decisions to make. Do
you lie quietly and wait for your children to come tumbling in with
their annual offerings of gratitude and affection, their homemade
cards, fund-raiser tie clips and bad cologne?
 &HT;    Or do you sneak out for a quick nine holes before anyone's the
wiser?
 &HT;    You turn and in the dimness can just make out the sleeping face
of your wife. You ask yourself where in the world you would be
without her.
 &HT;    Myrtle Beach?
 &HT;    Naah! This is where you belong, you tell yourself angrily. You
dope! A wife and children, good health, a steady job _ be honest
with yourself, you sorry hacker, would you trade them for anything
on this planet? Would you?
 &HT;    You choke back a tear.
 &HT;    Yes! Tiger Woods' swing.
 &HT;    Again, wearily, you try to imagine playing golf for a living,
having a job where you don't have to answer a phone, phone in an
answer, estimate budget figures, figure budget estimates or budget
estimated figures while answering the phone.
 &HT;    You are not so naive as to think that professional golfers don't
hate their jobs sometimes. And yet, try as you might, you cannot
imagine Woods telling himself that if he can just finish the back
nine by 5 o'clock he might be able to wedge in a quick staff
meeting before dinner.
 &HT;    OK, dude, you tell yourself, that's enough for one morning, get
a grip. Back to reality _ and a good, sane reality it is. You've
got some blessings to count:
 &HT;    + A wife who accepts your form of folly and who gets her
exercise hauling heavy packages around shopping malls. You both
carry your own bags.
 &HT;    + Kids who can be induced to come and play golf with you _ even
if it is for a price. You control the bets, however, and every
penny you have to pay out is worth it. The expression on a kid's
little face when a 20-foot putt is worth 20 bucks is priceless.
 &HT;    + Your own good sense, when all is said and done, in knowing
when to go for the greens and when to lay back, as now, in bed.
 &HT;    There are those Sundays when a full round of golf is a natural,
healthy choice. Is there any better alternative to the stupor of
the Super Bowl than a bracing round of golf on a deserted course,
even a snowy one?
 &HT;    And then there are those Sundays when abandoning your family to
play golf is maybe just a little bit sick. Father's Day is one,
Mother's Day definitely another.
 &HT;    So today, of all days, it's best to be still and enjoy your
status as father. Maybe one day your kid, interviewed after winning
a tournament and a big check on Father's Day, will smile at the
camera, wave and shout, ``I love you, Dad!'' _ just the way Woods
did on Mother's Day, except, of course, that he said, ``I love you,
Mom!''
 &HT;    And just think how popping proud you'll be that Father's Day,
watching it all on your VCR after coming in from your
late-afternoon round.

 By TIM HERRERA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Thanks to past Father's Days, I can go a month without washing
underwear and my necktie collection rivals the discount racks at
any department store. As the father of four children, I own
countless mugs, T-shirts and finger-paint artwork that read
``WORLD'S GREATEST DAD!''
 &HT;    I treasure every handcrafted present my three boys and one
daughter have ever made, because they made them for me. However, my
hopes may be too high for 1998.
 &HT;    ``What do you want for Father's Day this year?'' my boys asked.
 &HT;    Despite the countless strips of colored cloth that seem to mate
in my closet, I could always use another necktie. Coffee-shop
coupons beat scraping pennies off my dresser for a morning cup.
 &HT;    But this year, I want something radical: I want peace on
Father's Day.
 &HT;    I'm not talking about world peace _ although that would be nice,
too. I want tranquility within the four walls of our two-story
house.
 &HT;    I answered, ``What if you guys quit fighting on Father's Day?''
 &HT;    You see, a day rarely goes by in our house without ``He hit
me!'' followed by ``He hit me first!'' Then comes the witty
``Did-not-did-too!'' exchange.
 &HT;    I'm asking for a one-day truce, one that even NATO diplomats
would have trouble arranging. The treaty doesn't have to be in
writing _ I'll accept a verbal agreement, with or without
handshakes.
 &HT;    But I want an entire day without hearing ``Dork!'' ``Dog
breath!'' or something worse echoing through our house as the kids
battle for the Nintendo, the VCR or the remote control _ my remote
control.
 &HT;    My request puzzled them. Either they didn't understand or they
knew the mission was impossible. I could tell they were hunting for
an escape clause in an agreement they were reluctant to make.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, no fighting's good, Dad,'' they said. ``But how 'bout if
we go to the movies like we did last year? Maybe we can go see
`Godzilla?'''
 &HT;    ``What the heck,'' I said. ``Who needs peace and tranquility,
anyway?''
 &HT;    It seems we are forming a Father's Day tradition. Last year, we
also commemorated the day by watching loud, frightening and scaly
creatures engaging in noisy rampages. No, we weren't watching ``The
Jerry Springer Show'' or anything on C-Span _ we went to see ``The
Lost World.''
 &HT;    It was a memorable day, but not because of the film. It was
memorable because the outing was their idea.
 &HT;    I ended up taking our two older boys _ ages 8 and 10 _ to the
``Jurassic Park'' sequel. I felt the younger kids were too little
to watch dinosaurs devour screaming humans, even at matinee prices.
 &HT;    While driving to the theater with the boys, I started thinking
about my father and the only time I could ever remember just the
two of us going to the movies.
 &HT;    It was a cool, spring Pennsylvania day. Dad and I carried light
jackets as we walked to the old Memorial Theater, strolling along
the steep hills, past the Veterans Memorial and my school, St.
Joseph's Elementary.
 &HT;    Dad was barely 5-foot-4, but I was still much smaller and
struggled to keep up with his quick stride.
 &HT;    Sometimes I get angry because I can't recall everything about
that day. However, I am grateful for one image still floating in my
mind: I remember looking over, seeing the light from the movie
screen flickering on Dad's face and thinking how cool it was that
he was just spending time with me.
 &HT;    All the way home from the theater, I replayed the film for my
father. Since Dad laughed, I was positive he liked the Batman movie
as much as I did. But I never really found out _ I never thought to
ask.
 &HT;    Dad died about five years ago, and every third Sunday in June I
think of our day at the movies.
 &HT;    As my sons and I walked out of the theater after ``The Lost
World,'' our eyes adjusting to the sunlight glaring off the parking
lot, my middle son turned and asked: ``Dad, did you like the
movie?''
 &HT;    ``I sure did, pal.''
 &HT;    He'll never know how glad I am that he asked.
 &HT;    When we're coming out of the theater this year, maybe I'll catch
them in a weak moment and ask them to pick up the smelly sweat
socks they've scattered from the corner of the kitchen to the edge
of the driveway.
 &HT;    While we're at it, let's have an armpit-noise ceasefire _
especially at the dinner table and at church.
 &HT;    But perhaps I should just appreciate the time with them. The
time a child spends alone with his or her father is special. Too
often it's taken for granted by both parent and child.
 &HT;    Maybe peace at home on Father's Day is a bit much to ask. Maybe
all we need is another nice monster movie and some time together to
create some moments worth reliving.

 &UR; By JIM MCKAY &QL; 
 &UR; (Excerpted from ``The Real McKay: My Wide World of Sports'') &QL; 
(Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For more than 40 years, I have walked the fairways of the world
behind the game's greatest artists, playing in the most famous
championships on the planet's most storied courses.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, golf has exploded, both as a spectator and a
participant sport. Why?
</P>
<P>
   To me, it has principally been the result of the sterling
careers of certain players, and not Arnold Palmer alone. I'll be
audacious enough now to list my top 10 players, whose achievements
I have described on ABC and CBS during the past 40 years.
 &UR; The McKay Ratings &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Jack Nicklaus
</P>
<P>
   Twenty majors in all. Will anyone ever equal that?
</P>
<P>
   Tack on a total of 70 wins on the PGA Tour, two Walker Cup
teams, six Ryder Cup teams (twice captain), two U.S. Senior Open
titles and a Senior PGA. He intimidated his peers like no one since
Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus was not, however, without his crushing defeats or his
personal insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   His toughest loss came at Pebble Beach in the 1982 U.S. Open. At
the age of 42, he had finished his final round of the championship
and was standing beside the scorer's tent waiting to be interviewed
as the first player ever to win five U.S. Opens, if Tom Watson
bogied either of the last two holes. And Watson was in trouble, his
ball sitting in long grass behind the green of the par three 17th.
</P>
<P>
   From our tower at 18, I looked down on Nicklaus. He was staring
at a monitor showing Watson lining up his shot. From the difficult
lie, it might well run far across the green, leaving him a likely
bogie and setting up victory for Jack.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson made ``the shot heard round the world,'' knocking the
ball into the hole for a birdie. In that instant, as he stood just
below me, Jack's expression was not his usual ironic half-smile of
defeat, but a look of total shock and deep disappointment, the face
of a stricken youngster, not of the most famous golfer in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   2. Arnold Palmer
</P>
<P>
   To understand Arnold Palmer and his endless appeal to Everyman,
it helps to sit with him as I did at the home (in Latrobe, Pa.) he
and his wife, Winnie, have lived in for more than 35 years and
understand that he IS Everyman.
</P>
<P>
   He still loves to sit by the pool, looking down toward the
course he grew up on, just at the bottom of the hill. That day some
four or five years ago, he smiled and told me how he used to lie
outside his family's house on the edge of the course and wait for
the woman to come by the sixth hole--the woman who always gave him
a nickel if he would hit her ball over the water hazard for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see myself now when I was really small,'' he said.
``Making sure my dad couldn't see me because I wasn't allowed on
the course.''
</P>
<P>
   I once asked Arnold Palmer how he has kept such a hold on his
fans. He looked at me, a faint smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim,'' he said, ``maybe it's because they understand who I am.
I think I am an honestly sensitive and sentimental person. Maybe
they sense that I care a great deal about what I do and that their
encouragement means a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Lee Trevino
</P>
<P>
   My most vivid memory of Trevino in his heyday is at the 1972
British Open on the Muirfield links in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been the pro-am preceding the Quad Cities Open as
far as his attitude was concerned. He kept up a running
conversation, or more properly a monologue, with the Scottish
gallery all the way around.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on one tee, he turned to the crowd and said, ``They
took me to an old castle for dinner last night. We had food like
they ate back in the old days, and we ate like they did--with our
fingers. Heck, back home in Texas I even have a cat I taught to eat
with a fork!''
</P>
<P>
   Then he laughed and knocked his tee shot in his usual
left-to-right arc into the middle of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   4. Tom Watson
</P>
<P>
   Of his remarkable five British Open victories, four of them were
won by a single shot, one in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   If Nicklaus was the greatest and Palmer the most charismatic of
championship golfers, certainly Tom Watson, as he plays on in his
late 40s, still convinced that he will win another major, is the
most tenacious.
</P>
<P>
   5. Gary Player
</P>
<P>
   In July of 1954, at the age of 18, Gary Player stepped off a
train at a small town in Scotland, carrying a cardboard suitcase
held together with a piece of rope. Since that day, he has become
the world's most traveled athlete, flying around the globe year
after year, winning the national championships of the United
States, Great Britain, Australia, Chile, and Brazil, among others.
</P>
<P>
   His dedication to fitness and proper diet borders on the
fanatical, and some of his beliefs approach the mystical. In the
earlier days, he would usually dress totally in black. ``Why?'' he
was asked. ``It must be terribly hot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replied, ``but it makes me feel strong.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Greg Norman
</P>
<P>
   I feel uncomfortable not placing Greg Norman in my top bracket.
Today, he is probably the best-known golfer in the world, having
won 55 tournaments internationally, as well as 16 on the American
tour.
</P>
<P>
   But...
</P>
<P>
   Every great player has performances he would rather forget, but
Greg's have come in the spotlight of major championships and have
come in such dramatic fashion that they dominate his image, despite
all his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   7. Seve Ballesteros
</P>
<P>
   His emergence was sudden, his impact enormous, his downfall
unforeseen and shocking.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? No one knows, although some theorists blame
imperfections in his swing, others the explosive nature of his
character. But it seems to be over for Seve at age 40, unless he
can pull some middle-aged miracles as he creeps toward 50 and the
Senior Tour. His impact on the game remains, however.
</P>
<P>
   It was his play that forced expansion of the Ryder Cup matches
from the U.S. versus Great Britain and Ireland to the U.S. versus
all of Europe. As a result, the matches,have become an increasingly
competitive and major event.
</P>
<P>
   8. Nick Faldo
</P>
<P>
   He has not yet joined the pantheon of the game, partly because
of his rather phlegmatic personality and, in the minds of some
people, because of his reliance on a golfing guru named David
Leadbetter, who completely rebuilt Nick's swing and follows him
around the course and to the practice tee as if Faldo were still a
student, not a champion.
</P>
<P>
   At times, I have found myself thinking, Can you imagine Ben
Hogan being followed every step of his career by a coach?
</P>
<P>
   9. Ray Floyd
</P>
<P>
   How's this for career longevity? He was only 18 when he turned
pro 35 years ago. Now, as he nears his mid-50s, he is still winning
on the Senior Tour and occasionally returning to the regular tour
to instruct his juniors by example on how to play the game with
skill and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   10. To round out my top 10, I'll have to resort to that old cop-
out, a tie. In this case, a three way tie, among Ben Crenshaw, Tom
Kite and Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Now what shall I do about Tiger Woods and Ernie Els?
</P>
<P>
   All three of the world's famous championships were won in '97 by
men in their 20s; Woods, 21, the Masters; Els, 27, the U.S. Open;
and Leonard, 25, the British Open. Might one of them be the new
Nicklaus or Palmer? Possibly.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as ranking any of them, I can only echo the comment
made long ago by Red Smith. After Willie Mays had turned in his
second great season in the majors, someone asked Red if he thought
Mays was as good as Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come back and ask me that in 20 years,'' he said, ``and I'll
tell you.''

 By DEBBI J. KARPOWICZ  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Cakes topple. Drunken relatives fight. Brides turn out to be
allergic to their flowers. Gowns and tuxes don't arrive in time.
 &HT;    These are some of the mishaps that can beset a wedding, no
matter how carefully it is planned. Even wedding coordinators admit
that some things are beyond their control.
 &HT;    For example, Phyllis Block, head of the wedding team at The
World Trade Center in Boston, once handled a wedding at which the
couple's dog walked down the aisle _ and relieved himself.
 &HT;    Toni deLisi, a consultant in Waldwick, N.J., once planned a
wedding at The Plaza Hotel in New York, only to have thieves steal
the flowers from the delivery truck parked on Fifth Avenue.
 &HT;    Then there are times when things go really awry: Guests have
fistfights and get arrested. An ex-girlfriend sets the limo on
fire.
 &HT;    If anyone has seen couples get hitched _ with about every hitch
possible _ it's the Rev. Dennis James Robinson, a justice of the
peace and Unitarian minister based in Hopkinton, Mass.
 &HT;    Robinson, who performed 327 weddings in 1997, once married a
couple in a Jacuzzi filled with orange Jell-O. It involved 72
packets of gelatin, 268 gallons of water and a canoe-paddle
stirrer.
 &HT;    At one wedding over which Robinson presided, the bride's
divorced parents were on bad terms. After the groom's father gave
an emotional toast to the newlyweds, the bride's embittered father
grabbed the microphone and launched into a tirade.
 &HT;    ``I just wanted to let you all know that my ex-wife is a no-good
 !!% !%!,'' he ranted. Everyone gasped, as he continued, ``I also
wanted you all to know that I contributed to this wedding.''
 &HT;    He was interrupted by his ex-wife, who shot back, ``No, you
didn't, you  !!%!'' The ex-wife then jumped up, grabbed her
ex-husband's throat and punched him in the stomach.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the ex-husband's new girlfriend clawed at the ex-wife
with her fingernails, while both reached for the microphone to use
as a weapon.
 &HT;    The fight eventually spilled out into the parking lot. When all
was said and done, 11 people were arrested.
 &HT;    Another time, Robinson officiated at a ceremony on a patio
overlooking a golf course. During the nuptials, he realized there
was a ruckus behind him, but he didn't dare turn around. When it
came time for the bride to say her vows, a breathy voice in back of
him yelled, ``I do.''
 &HT;    It was the groom's ex-girlfriend, decked out in a wedding gown,
determined to get revenge. Pandemonium broke out faster than you
can say ``Fatal Attraction.'' The groom then warned everyone to be
careful, as his former flame had recently broken into his house,
trashed it and slit his car tires.
 &HT;    When the chauffeur left the limousine for a moment, the angry ex
took lighter fluid, wrote ``I Love You'' on the hood of the car and
set it on fire.
 &HT;    ``I left before I heard what happened next,'' Robinson says.
 &HT;    Another memorable affair was an Irish wedding at which the
budget-conscious couple relied on a relative and a boom box instead
of hiring professional musicians. Unfortunately, Uncle Joe got
inebriated and played tunes that were inappropriate, to say the
least. The parents danced to ``Send in the Clowns,'' the newlyweds
waltzed to ``The Stripper'' and the groom and his mother danced to
``Do It to Me One More Time.''
 &HT;    Doug Giordano, director of food and beverage at New Jersey's
Woodcliff Lake Hilton, once had a bride who was assaulted by
strangers in the restroom.
 &HT;    This happened at another hotel, where the ballroom and the bar
shared a restroom. Apparently, three jealous _ and intoxicated _
female customers came upon the happy bride in the bathroom, held
her against the wall and burned holes into her gown with their
cigarettes.
 &HT;    At another wedding that Giordano handled, three rap stars, who
had just performed at The Meadowlands, returned to their hotel and,
out of boredom, crashed the wedding in the ballroom. They ran out
onto the dance floor and started to sing and dance, Giordano
recalls. When one of the bridesmaids confronted them, it evolved
into a fistfight ``with split lips, black eyes and five police
cars,'' he says.
 &HT;    At least there were no threats of bullets. Teddy Lenderman, a
wedding coordinator in Terre Haute, Ind., wore a bulletproof vest
for one of the weddings she worked on _ as did the priest, groom
and several members of the wedding party.
 &HT;    Apparently, the groom's irrational mother didn't like the bride,
and told him, ``If you marry her, I'm going to come in and blow you
all away.''
 &HT;    No one took Mom seriously _ until she showed up at a relative's
funeral, where she slapped the corpse and slammed the casket shut.
When the funeral director approached her, she kicked him and broke
his leg in three places.
 &HT;    On the day before the wedding, she called the rectory five times
and threatened the clergyman with bodily harm.
 &HT;    On the wedding day, the nervous groom called his mom and forbade
her to come.
 &HT;    ``She didn't show,'' Lenderman says. ``But in my 14 years of
business, at that point, I had never experienced anything so
nerve-wracking.''
 &HT;    The bride was the tremulous one at a wedding attended by Barbara
Sheehan, an executive at The Royal Hawaiian in Hawaii.
 &HT;    Sheehan recalls that the bride got halfway down the aisle, then
turned around to ask one of her bridesmaids a question:
 &HT;    ``You can learn to love someone, can't you?''

 &UR; By MARTHA A. WOODHAM &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; From ``The Bride Did What?!''
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Brides and grooms get so much advice _ most of it wrong _ that
they panic. It's like having a baby: As soon as people find out
you're expecting a wedding, they feel free to tell you what to do
and give dire warnings about being improper _ i.e., tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Your mother is sure she knows what's correct. Your beloved's
mother has her own ideas, and your neighbor down the street can't
wait to tell you horror stories about the tacky weddings she's
attended. You begin to feel queasy at the thought of ``Your Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, worry no more. Here are the Top Ten Marriage Myths _ and
the right answers, no matter what anyone says. Folks will swear
these myths are the eternal Etiquette Truth etched in stone and
handed down by some Etiquette God. Well, they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   1. The bride and groom must ask their siblings to be bridesmaids
and groomsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is customary to ask brothers and sisters to be
attendants, the bride and groom are free to ask whomever they wish
_ best friends, pals from the office, a buddy from a favorite bar.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: This could be deadly. Friends come and go, while
your families are there forever. You avoid a lot of hurt feelings
by asking brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Tacky brides wail, ``But I don't feel close to his sisters. I
want my friends instead.'' A wedding is a great place to get
acquainted. After the ``I do's,'' those strangers will be your
sisters, too.
</P>
<P>
   2. The bride must be escorted down the aisle and given away by
someone.
</P>
<P>
   Being given away is a tradition that evolved from the days when
men bought brides from their fathers or, even worse, captured them.
Today many young women feel this custom is archaic. Somehow it was
charming when a woman went from her father's home directly to her
new husband's, but that's not true of most couples today.
</P>
<P>
   With so many women going to college, supporting themselves and
marrying later, being ``given away'' seems terribly out-of-date.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want it, leave it out of the ceremony. And if you
choose, walk down the aisle by yourself. Not every bride has a
father, nor does every bride like her father. Some brides say going
solo made them feel like royalty.
</P>
<P>
   3. The bride's father must sit in the first pew with the bride's
mother, even if they hate the sight of each other.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, divorced mothers and fathers would overcome
their loathing so all could be sweetness and light on their child's
wedding day.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get real. Divorce is a 1990s fact of life. When divorced
parents get along, it's wonderful. Mom and Dad can sit together,
one big happy parental unit on the first pew.
</P>
<P>
   This changes if stepparents are in the picture. Mom _ and her
new husband _ should sit in the first pew. Dad _ and his new wife _
should sit in the next pew.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not get along, Dad and his new wife should sit even
farther back in the church _ far enough away to avoid bodily harm.
(All of this goes for the groom's parents, too.)
</P>
<P>
   4. The number of groomsmen must equal the number of bridesmaids.
</P>
<P>
   So who's counting? Unlike many other areas of modern life, there
is no rule that says a wedding party must have equality.
</P>
<P>
   An equal number of men and women makes a pretty picture at the
altar _ and makes life easier for the wedding consultant _ but this
is not mandatory. You can have all men, all women _ even all
children if you like.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be politically correct at your wedding.
</P>
<P>
   5. A bride cannot ask her mother to be the matron of honor.
</P>
<P>
   If a father can be a best man, there is no reason a mother can't
be matron of honor. It's a beautiful, loving gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback is if the wedding is a very large one. The
mother of the bride and the matron of honor each may have so many
duties that it could be a burden to ask your mom to undertake both
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But if a bride's mom is extremely organized and is her best
friend, she should ask her.
</P>
<P>
   6. A bride cannot ask her mother to escort her down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   If a father can escort his daughter, there is no reason a mother
can't. More and more brides are asking their moms to make the
stroll down the aisle instead of bench-warming the first pew. This
custom is borrowed from Jewish ceremonies, where both parents
escort the bride and groom.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lovely gesture, and most moms are thrilled to be asked.
</P>
<P>
   7. A flower girl must be under age 6.
</P>
<P>
   The littler they are, the cuter they are _ and the more they can
disrupt your ceremony! The same goes for ring bearers.
</P>
<P>
   Flower girls have refused to go down the aisle or toss their
petals. One little ring bearer grabbed the flower girl's basket,
dumped the petals in a pile and began jumping on it.
</P>
<P>
   And my mom loves to tell of when I was a flower girl: At a
crucial moment in the ceremony, I stage-whispered, ``Mommy, I have
to tee-tee.''
</P>
<P>
   The only criterion for the job of flower girl or ring bearer
should be how important a child is to you. If the little girl or
little boy is someone you want to include, by all means do it, no
matter how old _ or young _ the child is.
</P>
<P>
   8. Brides and grooms must pick attendants who are close to their
own age.
</P>
<P>
   No, the only requirement for being an attendant is a sincere
attachment to the bride or groom _ and the ability to pay for the
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   I know of brides in their 20s who had bridesmaids in their 60s,
and the weddings were full of love and rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   9. A pregnant woman cannot be a bridesmaid.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mystery to me why it is considered poor manners to have
a pregnant woman participate in a ceremony so full of fertility
symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, bridesmaids were young women who surrounded the
bride to confuse any evil spirits lurking about. Perhaps a
bridesmaid had to be fleet-footed, and it's hard to run when you
are pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   I see no problems with asking a friend who is with child, other
than logistical ones: She may have trouble fitting into her dress,
and she may feel uncomfortable standing for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   10. There can be only one maid of honor and one matron of honor.
</P>
<P>
   A bride may have two of either if she wishes. And she doesn't
have to limit herself to women.
</P>
<P>
   If the bride's best friend is a guy, she should ask him. But she
shouldn't call him, as one Atlanta bride did, her ``mister of
honor.''

<P>
   His parents: ``Your turkey is dry, you didn't take the family
name and you're five years older than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Your parents: ``He's not your religion, he's supporting an
ex-wife and child and you make more money than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   And if either of your parents nudges you about wanting
grandchildren one more time ...
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the line between amicability and all-out war can be
thin where in-laws are concerned. With practice, though, experts
say, you can learn to get along ... and the sooner the better.
</P>
<P>
   Intruding in-laws are a mainstay on the marital trouble list,
says Marlene Watson, a couples-and-family therapist in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents never stop being protective or wanting the best for
their child,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, she explains, one partner may feel that an in-law is
interfering and his or her spouse is not doing anything about it.
Then, to make matters worse, the spouse feels he or she is being
attacked by the partner and pressured by one or both sets of
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battle No. 1 is, `Where's your primary loyalty?''' says
Watson, who is also director of the couples-and-family therapy
graduate program at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia. ``Your primary allegiance needs to be with your
partner, but you can't exclude parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to riding out most in-law conflicts is to act as a
united couple, Watson says. Both partners need to set up boundaries
and communicate them to the in-laws. This could mean asking your
mother not to call before 9:30 a.m. on weekends or telling your
father-in-law that your financial affairs are a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important not to put down your spouse's parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes the partner defensive and rally to the side of the
parent,'' Watson says. Instead, explain to your mate what the
problem is and involve him or her in suggesting ways to resolve the
conflict.
 &UR; COUPLES AT RISK: WHO ISN'T? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few people sail into in-law relationships without some
apprehension and discomfort at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage is a transition for everyone,'' Watson says.
``You're bringing together two sets of rules, and each family feels
its rules should be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of these differences are arbitrary and not really
important, says Michael Ascher, a psychologist and professor of
psychiatry at Temple University School of Medicine. For instance,
he says, while a new bride may disapprove of her in-laws'
predinner-cocktail ritual, she can learn to accept that it isn't
tantamount to alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that younger people have more problems relating
to their in-laws than those over 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and in-laws play a more significant role with younger
people, for whom conflicts about independence and autonomy still
exist,'' Ascher notes.
</P>
<P>
   In-law tensions may erupt as soon as the couple announces the
engagement. Parents may feel abandoned and experience anxiety about
the impending separation. There may be discomfort about
acknowledging their child's sexuality. They may fear adverse
changes in the family structure. Or differences in the new
son-in-law or daughter-in-law may be perceived as a threat or
rejection of their own values.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Bilofsky, a Cherry Hill, N.J.-based psychotherapist and
co-author of ``Inlaws/Outlaws: How to Make Peace with His Family
and Yours'' (Villard Books, 1991), encourages newlyweds to reassure
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavy doses of `I love you, I will always love you and I will
always be your child' go a long way toward easing a parent's
troubled heart,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly if the bride is older than her husband, his mother
may feel that her daughter-in-law is trying to usurp her role. Or a
new wife may become anxious that the undesirable qualities she
observes in her new father-in-law will be transferred to his son.
And don't overlook potential sibling-in-law problems, Watson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siblings can have as major an impact on the couple as
parents,'' she says. `` They may call to ask for money, become very
protective or take a strong dislike to the in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you meet your in-laws, have your fiance brief you about
their likes, dislikes and sensitivities. The added knowledge will
reduce the risk of your offending them and enable you to ask
questions that engage their interest.
 &UR; POTENTIAL SORE SPOTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Wedding planning.
</P>
<P>
   If a couple pays for all the arrangements, they may have things
exactly as they wish, Watson says. If parents are financing the
affair, though, the couple should be prepared to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   + Juggling families.
</P>
<P>
   One newlywed says the biggest adjustment has been getting used
to the visitation demands of her husband's large, very close
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into this huge family who did everything together. My
family felt like I was always with my husband's family for
birthdays, Sunday dinners and holidays,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she says, she had to deal with ``the insanity of
having to be at both sets of parents' homes for every holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the couple announced they were alternating: They
would spend Thanksgiving and Christmas Day with her family, and
Christmas Eve and Easter with his folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fourth of July is up for grabs!'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Another time when both had sisters celebrating birthdays on the
same day, the couple simply agreed to split up so each could attend
his or her own family's party.
</P>
<P>
   + Negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   The experts agree that it is wise to deal with your own parents
about sensitive issues such as financial requests or choosing baby
names, especially early in the marriage. Not only do you know your
parents' quirks, but any resulting anger and annoyance is more
likely to be forgiven and forgotten with you than with your spouse,
Ascher says.
</P>
<P>
   Once you know your in-laws better, try to handle disagreements
yourself without putting your spouse in the middle. Find a tactful
way to ask that your mother-in-law call before dropping in. Or
state firmly that family-planning decisions are between you and
your husband.
</P>
<P>
   + Money.
</P>
<P>
   Asking parents for money can set the stage for disputes about
how the gift is used and how you're living your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't accept large gifts unless you're willing to accept the
negatives that may go with them,'' Ascher advises. ``If you accept
a house down payment, expect visits and interference. Decide if
it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   + Criticism.
</P>
<P>
   If one of your parents is making derogatory statements about
your spouse, your first priority is to your husband or wife. A
parent should be told that he or she doesn't have to love your
spouse, but must respect your choice.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tolerate your spouse criticizing your parents, and don't
let your in-laws play you against your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   + Cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your family ignores your spouse in conversations and
activities, continue to include him or her in important events and
discussions. Maintain a separate relationship with your parents,
too, such as having lunch sometimes, Watson recommends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may just have to give a parent time,'' she says. ``Stay in
there and have faith.''
</P>
<P>
   What if you plain don't like one of your in-laws?
</P>
<P>
   ``Your best bet is to be patient, cordial and mannerly,''
according to Bilofsky. ``You have a loved one in common. Do it for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, she adds, ``Remind yourself that your in-laws
must have done something right _ look at the child they raised.''

 By EVERETT DeMORIER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From ``Crib Notes for the First Year of Marriage''  
 &HT;    Whether you've been living together since junior high school or
spent your first night together on your honeymoon, the agenda for
the first year of marriage is pretty much the same. Just when you
thought you knew your spouse better than your spouse knew himself
or herself, you're really meeting each other for the first time.
 &HT;    Many young couples tend to see married life as an extension of
single life, with an additional person. But as soon as two people
step across the marriage threshold, with sweater-drying rack and
dartboard in hand, two sets of histories and expectations must
join.
 &HT;    Studies of marriage show there is no correlation between an easy
first year of marriage and living together prior to being married,
but living together does get a few of those
put-the-old-milk-carton-in-front-of-the-new-one-so-we-use-the-
old-one-first type of rules out of the way. Some of them, but not
all.
 &HT;    Below are some of the most common issues in the first year of
marriage, and some suggestions for how couples can deal with them.
 &HT;    + Feeling at home.
 &HT;    Having a housewarming or a dinner party is a great way to make a
new home your own, whether you have moved in with your spouse or
the two of you have moved into a new home together. Having friends
and family there to see you in your new surroundings can create a
sense of pride in your home, and a feeling of ease and comfort.
 &HT;    Sometimes it's the little things that help establish roots, such
as being the voice on the answering machine, planting a garden or
making friends with the neighbors.
 &HT;    + The slob factor.
 &HT;    If your spouse's housekeeping skills leave a bit to be desired,
if clothes and dishes pave a path from the couch to the
refrigerator, the pile method is a great alternative to bashing
your spouse with a tire iron.
 &HT;    The pile method simply involves picking a neutral location _ a
desk, a dresser, a closet, somewhere you can live with a mess _ and
placing all the wallets, car keys, dirty socks, magazines, dishes
and so forth in that place.
 &HT;    This works for the ``neatnik,'' because everything can be picked
up and deposited quickly, and it works for the slob because
everything is in one place. Note: This is a treatment, not a cure.
 &HT;    + The clash of expectations.
 &HT;    Sit down and discuss in detail how you expect your life as a
couple to be. Maybe your mental picture is unrealistic. You won't
know until it's out in the open. Be specific.
 &HT;    Do you expect coffee to be brought to you in the morning like
your father did for your mother? Do you expect your mate to be home
exactly at 5 o'clock? Do you expect to be able to have friends over
every night?
 &HT;    The majority of newlyweds' fights occur when one spouse is not
acting the way the other spouse expects. But no one, not even
Robert Duvall, can act without a script.
 &HT;    + The age-old toothpaste dilemma.
 &HT;    This type of conflict is quite normal and really simple to
resolve when you get right down to it. If your mate insists on
leaving the cap off the toothpaste, or worse, squeezing the tube in
the middle (gasp!), just buy two tubes of toothpaste.
 &HT;    To solve the problem of whether to roll the toilet paper over or
under _ believe it or not, this actually accounted for an entire
segment on Oprah _ try installing two rollers.
 &HT;    Of course, having separate bathrooms would solve not only both
these problems but also that perennial problem in the battle of the
sexes: Should the toilet seat be left up or down?
 &HT;    The best advice is just to get over it. Sure, you think the
world would be a lot better place if your mate would just ... But
would it really?
 &HT;    Personal habits take some getting used to. Any two people need
time to adjust to each other, a new lifestyle and new surroundings.
Relax. A routine will develop soon enough, and you will quickly
forget that you were ever uncomfortable.
 &HT;    + ``Don't talk to me before I have my coffee.''
 &HT;    There are morning people and there are night people. And then
there are peppy morning people. If you've married one of those
people who pop out of bed, draw open the shades and sing in the
shower ... first of all, my condolences. On the other hand, your
mate is probably a happy person, which may be why you fell in love
with him or her in the first place.
 &HT;    + ``Isn't the game over yet?''
 &HT;    Husbands watching sports all weekend is one of the most frequent
complaints heard from newlywed women. While women often complain
about their husband's sports-viewing habits, however, many women
actually like watching sports on television, particularly with
their mates. Where couples run into trouble is when watching sports
occupies the entire weekend.
 &HT;    One possible solution is planning specific games and sports to
watch, rather than just watching anything that's on.
 &HT;    Here are some other solutions:
 &HT;    Have a sports party. Invite friends or other couples over to
watch the game.
 &HT;    Participate in a sport together. Join a volleyball team or a
bowling league. Take up tennis or golf. Being involved in a sport
makes it more interesting to watch it on television.
 &HT;    Go to the sporting event together. Rather than lounge in the
easy chair all day Saturday, buy tickets to the local college
football game and make a day of it.
 &HT;    Go do something else on your weekend time together, and listen
to the game on the way.
 &HT;    + Sharing the covers.
 &HT;    There's not much people can do to change their behaviors when
they're fast asleep. Thus, newlyweds often complain about the
spouse's snoring, hogging the covers or kicking them in the middle
of the night.
 &HT;    There are some things both partners can do before falling
asleep, however, that can reduce the occurrence of cover stealing.
For instance, if the partner who steals the blankets dresses more
warmly for bed, he or she may not be as likely to feel cold during
the night. Likewise, if the partner who ends up without covers
during the night dresses more warmly, he or she will not mind as
much when the covers disappear.
 &HT;    Another solution would be to keep an emergency blanket next to
the bed so that whoever finds himself or herself without covers
during the night can use a substitute blanket.
 &HT;    For a more romantic option, try sleeping closer together. Body
heat is better than a blanket any day.

in a full-blown recession, the Finance Ministry said that the
economy contracted at a 5.3 percent annual rate in the year's first
quarter. Compared with the prior three months, the decline in gross
domestic product was 1.3 percent, faster than the contraction in
1997's final three months.It was the first time in six years that
Japan had recorded two consecutive quarterly declines. By Sheryl
WuDunn.

   SIXTIES-REVISITED (Undated) _ Historians are beginning to
rewrite the history of the 1960s, saying that the culture wars have
distorted our understanding of the period. By Patti Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   DEAD-MULES (Undated) _ They die by asphhyxiation, rabies,
drowning and falling off cliffs. They are hit by railroad trains,
worked to death, hanged, stabbed, shot and, in one Cormac McCarthy
novel, decapitated by an irate opera singer. Such is the fate of
the mules of the South as recounted in a minor classic of mock
scholarship entitled ``Equine Gothic: The Dead Mule as Generic
Signifier in Southern Literature in the Twentieth Century'' that
asked a simple question, ``What makes Southern literature
Southern?'' and came up with a simpler answer. You can tell it's
Southern if it has a dead mule in it. But, if the dead mule is the
signifier for Southern literature, what is the element that makes
French literature French or Irish literature Irish or film noir
noir? By Peter Applebome.

   BOSNIA-LIBRARIES (Undated) _ Over the last five years, efforts
on behalf of Bosnia's cultural institutions have steadily sharpened

Ingathering Project, an Internet-based effort to track down copies
of records, manuscripts and unique historical documents that were
destroyed in the war. By Len A. Costa.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS USE RARE TACTIC TO FORCE VOTES ON FLOOR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Democrats said Thursday that they plan to use
a rare parliamentary tactic to circumvent Republican leaders and
force floor votes on four bills, creating campaign issues for the
fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the earlier success of a discharge petition to
force the House to reconsider campaign finance legislation,
Democratic leaders announced they will use the same tactic to bring
up bills on education, tobacco, patient rights, as well campaign
finance, which currently appears to be stymied.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wholesale discharge,'' said House Democratic leader
Richard Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   The discharge petition allows a majority of House members to
force floor consideration of a measure without going through the
House Rules Committee, which sets limits on the debate and
amendments for each piece of legislation. Democrats hope to
persuade some moderate Republicans to join them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this spring, supporters of the major campaign finance
bill sponsored by Representatives Martin Meehan (D-Mass.) and
Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) had collected 205 signatures on a
discharge petition, close enough to the 218 required to persuade
GOP leaders to allow a floor debate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now is languishing on the House floor, subject to
lengthy debate and parliamentary maneuvers that will allow numerous
amendments and substitutes designed to kill the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, House leaders have been unable to agree on a bill
to regulate health maintenance organizations, and key GOP leaders
oppose any increase in the tobacco tax that is the heart of the
tobacco bill being debated in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most Republicans are against President Clinton's
proposals on education to fund an additional 100,000 teachers, plus
school renovation and construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moderate Republicans who are rightfully concerned about their
own reelection want something on health care, education, campaign
finance reform and tobacco,'' said Gephardt. ``They are getting
tired of the right-wing extreme agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could win back the House on those three issues,'' said
Meehan, referring to tobacco, campaign finance and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Democrats are in the minority, they are counting on
support from moderate Republicans to sign the discharge petitions
and help pass legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are seeing is the emergence of a bipartisan coalition
on a lot of issues,'' Gephardt said at his regular weekly news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   But House majority leader Richard Armey dismissed Gephardt's
plan, saying the House would approve the GOP bills on those topics
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those votes will be taken before he gets his discharge
petition,'' said Armey.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' strategy would put two Massachusetts lawmakers on
the spot _ Representatives J. Joseph Moakley of South Boston and
Richard Neal of Springfield. They oppose discharge petitions
because they say the procedure bypasses the normal process. Moakley
was chairman of the Rules Committee when Democrats controlled the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Neither lawmaker signed the discharge petition for the
Shays-Meehan bill, and they do not plan on changing their position,
their spokesmen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Amglott, a spokesman for Shays, said Shays is considering
circulating another discharge petition to move along his campaign
finance bill, but he would not necessarily support other discharge
petitions.

</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Motors yesterday agreed to pay a record $34 million
to 350 woman assembly line workers at its Illinois plant, ending a
bitter two-year lawsuit involving allegations that the employees
were targets of groping and sexual insults for years and that
company managers did nothing to prevent the harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the settlement, by far the largest in the
history of the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, will
shake the corporate landscape in ways previous cases have not,
labor specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's huge money, absolutely huge,'' said Paul Stantzler, an
employment lawyer for Boston's Burns &AMP; Levinson. ``Nobody can
possibly ignore this. The message for anybody who runs a business
is that you overlook problems like that at your peril because the
price will be very large.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, contained in a consent decreee which is still
subject to federal court approval, also requires the Japanese-owned
auto maker to provide mandatory sexual harassment training to
employees, revise its sexual harassment policy and investigate
allegations of harassment within three weeks. A three-person panel
will monitor the company's compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the 350 employees will receive payouts
ranging from several thousand dollars to as much as $300,000, the
limit allowed for damages under federal law for sexual harassment
cases filed by the EEOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it, the Mitsubishi situation is not
unique and no employer should assume that it can't happen in my
company,'' said EEOC chairman Paul M. Igasaki at a news conference
yesterday. ``Other employers should take heed. EEOC will
aggressively pursue problems like this.''
</P>
<P>
   In settling the case, Mitsubishi made no admission of
wrongdoing. At a news conference, Mitsubishi executive vice
president Larry Greene, surrounded by top company executives, said:
``We of course apologize to any employee who has been harassed or
retaliated against.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous record settlement for a sexual harassment case
brought by the EEOC was $9.85 million, paid by Astra USA &UR;  &LR; of
Westborough, the US subsidiary of the Swedish pharmaceutical maker.
In that case, Lars Bildman, the company's chief executive, and
other top managers were accused of fondling women employees and
pressuring them for sex.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the Mitsubishi settlement reflects the severity and
breadth of the allegations in the EEOC's complaint, according to
labor lawyers. The EEOC charged that at least since 1990 male
workers and managers at the company's manufacturing plant in
Normal, Ill. engaged in continual ``groping, grabbing and
touching'' of women assembly line workers. They also pressured some
of the women to have sex with them as a condition of employment,
the EEOC said. Some women who complained were fired, according to
the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The women contended that male workers routinely called them
``whores'' and ``bitches'' and more obscene terms. They also said
men displayed sexual graffiti and pictures, including pornographic
drawings of the women workers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said Mitsubishi failed to take ``corrective action'' in
response to the employees' complaints.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning the Mitsubishi plant's mostly American
management was adamant in its denial of the charges and said the
suit was an attention-getting move by politically motivated
bureaucrats _ a reference to the EEOC enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi took the offensive by organizing a demonstration
outside the EEOC's offices in Chicago. About 3,000 company workers
were paid a full day's wages to take part in the protest against
the EEOC's charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad move,'' said Nancy Shilepsky, an employment lawyer for
Dwyer &AMP; Collora who has authored several books on labor law and has
followed the case closely. ``I don't know what they were thinking,
but it was a very bad move.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit became a high-profile war of words between Mitsubishi
and the EEOC, where the stakes were indeed high. The commission
faced funding cuts undere the Reagan and Bush administrations and
had a string of failed cases and a tarnished public image.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, people were saying it had no teeth and that it just
wasn't effective,'' Shilepsky said. ``A few years ago, it revved up
to try to do high-profile cases. They went after some cases and
really overreached. They had to do something to right the
perception they are not an effective or relevent body.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi ultimately backed off its hard-line strategy, hiring
former US Labor Secretary Lynn Martin to study its workplace and
make recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the company said it was implementing a wide range
of programs designed to eliminate discrimination and harassment,
though it didn't acknowledge that the alleged illegal actions had
occurred. Last year, the company settled a separate sexual
harassment suit brought by 27 women for $9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The size and publicity of the Mitsubishi agreement will, like
all large settlements, have the unintended effect of encouraging a
host of new lawsuits across the country, some of them unfounded,
labor lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can expect a rash of claims that probably can't be
supported,'' said John Adkins, a partner at Bingham Dana &UR;  &LR; in
Boston. ``It's a predictable outcome of a settlement that large.
And usually when you see a rise of claims like that they never
quite fall again to the level where they started. It means as a
society we'll have more charges and more litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the greater good we have a very tricky balance to
strike. It's like treating cancer. You try to kill the cancer
without killing the patient. We all hate a litigious society, but
the alternative is not acceptable.''

   CAN'T HARDLY WAIT &QC; 
Directed and written by: Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan &QC; 
Starring: Ethan Embry, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Peter Facinelli,
Lauren Ambrose &QC; 
Running time: 98 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Playing at: Copley Place; suburbs
</P>
<P>
   Rating: PG-13
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a film doesn't have to be classically good, just good
enough.
</P>
<P>
   This is the case with ``Can't Hardly Wait,'' a breezy summer
teen flick that will never be mistaken for a Merchant-Ivory epic.
It should earn, deservedly, the love of its intended audience, the
millions of young people with surplus leisure time over summer
vacation: It respects that audience by avoiding the contrived
situations and lame dialogue that torpedo most teen movies.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, ``Can't Hardly Wait'' will solidify the position of
Jennifer Love Hewitt as the Ally Sheedy of her generation (the
``Breakfast Club,'' ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' pre-``High Art'' Sheedy).
Hewitt is a marginally interesting young actress from TV's ``Party
of Five'' and last year's slasher flick ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer'' who, depite acting that's as flat as her subdued Texas
twang, seems to cause testosterone spikes in young men.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps those lads were looking more at the external package,
which must have been what first drove Preston Meyers (Ethan Embry)
to swoon so heavily when Hewitt's Amanda Beckett sat next to him in
freshman English. Meyers is leaving town the day after high school
graduation and has finally worked up the courage to profess his
enduring love to prom queen Beckett, who ignored him in class and
went out with the school's uberstud, Mike Dexter (Peter Facinelli).
</P>
<P>
   It's typical byzantine high-school social intrigue, its
participants a collection of stereotypical cliques (jocks, geeks,
stoners, the cool kids), but writer/directors Harry Elfont and
Deborah Kaplan make the situation play out over a single day in the
lives of these teens. As in the ``Peanuts'' comic strip, parents
are intentionally reduced to off-screen ciphers who have little
direct contact with their children. ``Can't Hardly Wait'' opens
with a graduation ceremony where there's much hat tossing and
hugging but no adults.
</P>
<P>
   Once the scene is set _ a big party attended by most of the
school _ the film moves well, its stories woven in a series of
fast-moving anecdotal scenes that evoke the feel of the innovative
television show ``Parker Lewis Can't Lose.'' Pacing helps ease the
film over its scattered rough spots, and occasional laugh-out-loud
dialogue keeps the energy level high. The story takes several
unexpected twists, especially a wonderful cameo by Jenna Elfman
(``Dharma and Greg'') as a wayward angel, but opts for the typical
feel-good Hollywood ending. It's one of the few bad moves in an
otherwise fine film that, among today's teens, should resonate as
strongly as ``The Breakfast Club'' did for their older siblings.

TEXAS TOWN TRIES TO COPE WITH VICIOUS RACIAL CRIME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The horror began with an act of kindness.
</P>
<P>
   James Byrd Jr., a disabled musician with big dreams of putting
this dusty, East Texas town on the map with his songs, was walking
home from a family party Saturday night when a man with a familiar
face stopped on a dark highway to offer him a ride. It was the last
of Byrd's life.
</P>
<P>
   In the nightmare that followed, Byrd was brutally beaten,
chained by his ankles to the back of a pickup truck and torn to
pieces as his body was dragged along a country road in a vicious
hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   The killing ripped the scab off Jasper, a community like
thousands of others where racial tensions quietly simmer. The
tragedy emblazoned the small timber town on the national map,
cruelly fulfilling Byrd's dream.
</P>
<P>
   As Byrd's family prepared Thursday for his funeral, the slaying
of the 49-year-old grandfather revived images of bygone racial
violence and confronted national leaders and ordinary citizens with
a question none could answer: Why do people continue to commit such
horrible acts?
</P>
<P>
   Three white ex-convicts, who police say were members of a white
supremacist group, were charged Tuesday with murdering Byrd, who
was black.
</P>
<P>
   ``As small as James seemed in life, he is powerful in death,''
said Ethel Parks, a lifelong friend. ``Maybe it took this to force
us all to find a way to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper, a town of 8,000 about 120 miles northeast of Houston, is
big enough for a Wal-Mart but small enough that the Cotton Patch
Cafe still sells a plate of chicken-fried steak and fries for
$2.99.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents, black and white, said race relations generally
have been positive in recent years, although they said problems
remain.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Byrd's death stretches from a craggy, red-clay
road, where the attack began, along 2 miles of pocked asphalt to a
white clapboard church and cemetery, where the last of his remains
and effects were found. All 81 spots on the road where pieces of
Byrd were discovered are marked wth bright orange spray paint.
</P>
<P>
   The crime was so jarring that the county sheriff, Billy Rowles,
wept when he arrived at the Jasper home of Byrd's parents to
deliver the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are killed every day,'' said James Byrd Sr., a deacon
at the New Bethel Baptist Church, as he sat in his parlor eating a
lunch provided by neighbors. ``But the brutality of what they did
to James, that's what's really hard to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Police laid out a chilling account of the killing in a
probable-cause affidavit charging the three Jasper men _ Robert
Russell Brewer, 31, John William King, and Shawn Berry, both 23 _
with murder. Police based their account on a statement from Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a night of drinking, Berry said, the men were riding in his
1982 gray pickup down a main highway in Jasper sometime after
midnight when Berry, the driver, spotted Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who had served time for burglary, recognized Byrd from
his parole office. Byrd had been in prison for theft and forgery.
</P>
<P>
   But when Berry pulled over to offer Byrd a ride, King balked.
``You don't need to be picking up a (racial slur),'' King told
Berry, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   King's and Brewer's arms are covered with tattoos linking them
to the Aryan Nation, a white supremacist group that all three
suspects allegedly joined in prison.
</P>
<P>
   With Byrd seated in the bed of the truck, the four rode to a
nearby convenience store, where King began to drive. Berry said
King drove several miles east of Jasper to a dirt road near a
winding creek, then stopped. ``I'm fixin' to scare'' Byrd, King
allegedly said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said King and Brewer then beat and kicked Byrd and chained
him to the truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to start `The Turner Diaries' early,'' King was
quoted as saying as he drove off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Turner Diaries'' is a novel that depicts the slaughter of
blacks and is popular among antigovernment militia groups and white
supremacists.
</P>
<P>
   As the truck pulled Byrd along the winding, hilly asphalt road,
his belongings _ keys, dentures, wallet, tennis shoes, and clothing
_ fell in his wake, as did parts of his body. Hundreds of yards
separated the spots where police found Byrd's head, neck, right
arm, and torso the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   M.L. Traylor Jr., who describes himself and other residents of
the road as distant relatives of Byrd, was watching a Western movie
on television when the truck pulling Byrd roared by his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard something coming and looked out and saw the truck
going by,'' Tyler said, ``but I never saw James.''
</P>
<P>
   The police trail to the suspects began when a witness said he
saw Byrd in the pickup truck, which they traced to Berry. At the
scene of the beating, authorities also found tools inscribed with
Berry's name, beer cans, a compact disc by the group Kiss, and a
cigarette lighter inscribed with the name ``Possum'' and a symbol
for Aryan Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses later said Possum was King's nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they have found no motive for the slaying other
than racial hatred. The FBI has joined the investigation to pursue
possible hate-crimes charges that could carry the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Texas law makes capital punishment available only if prosecutors
can prove the murder was committed in association with another
felony, such as kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's preference, mine included, is for this to be a
capital murder case,'' said the district attorney, Guy James Gray.
``We have to have evidence to prove that in court, and that's what
we're working on right now,''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has offered condolences to Byrd's family, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson has flown in to call for peace and progress, and
aides to Vice President Al Gore were calling local officials to
arrange a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's family said Chicago Bulls basketball player Dennis Rodman
had offered to pay the funeral expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was fear among many residents of a nasty
aftermath. The imperial wizard of a Ku Klux Klan faction in Vidor,
55 miles away, said the Klan would remain active in Jasper, despite
assertions by law enforcment officials that no white supremacist
group operates in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing is, we don't who they are,'' said Gwen Carter,
a longtime friend of Byrd. ``They're not wearing white sheets
anymore. Some of them might be wearing three-piece suits. And none
of wants to see this happen to anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Many white residents joined the call for healing. Some hung
banners in storefront windows that read ``Pray for Jasper and the
Byrd Family,'' and ``Let's All Pray For Unity.''
</P>
<P>
   A teenage brother and sister, Chris and Melissa Bush, handed out
yellow ribbons and drove stakes into the ground with ribbons
fluttering from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show that all people of Jasper are not racists,''
Chris Bush said, his face glistening with sweat in the 90-degree
heat. ``We do care what happened to Mr. Byrd.''

A FILM EQUIVALENT OF BEACH-BLANKET READING, AIRY AND FLUFFY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS &QC; 
Directed by: Ivan Reitman &QC; 
Screenplay by: Michael Browning &QC; 
Starring: Harrison Ford, Anne Heche, David Schwimmer, Jacqueline
Obradors, Temuera Morrison, Allison Janney &QC; 
Running time: 101 minutes &QC; 
Rated: PG-13 (language, sensuality and brief violence) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' is film's equivalent of beach blanket
reading. Light, breezy, pleasant, no surprises, in one eye and out
the other, no aftertaste, perfectly serviceable escapism as it
throws Harrison Ford together with Anne Heche on a desert island.
It's no ``African Queen'' or even ``Romancing the Stone,'' but it
at least frees Ford from heavy lifting, like, say, carrying Air
Force One on his back. Here, he's a pilot whose roughed-up cargo
plane is forced down by a squall after Heche's high-powered New
York magazine editor (is there any other kind?) hires him to fly
her to Tahiti when an assignment suddenly looms. There's always
been comic potential in the mix of dread and grumpiness Ford wears
so naturally, and Heche gives him plenty to be grumpy about.
</P>
<P>
   The career-agenda-driven editor's pushy disdain is the very sort
of thing that made Ford's throttle jockey opt for the beachcombing
life. She gripes, he grumbles. Naturally, they're made for each
other, but just need a little time to discover it. In other words,
first they crash, then they fall. The flying scenes are the film's
funniest, the only times, in fact, that ``Six Days, Seven Nights''
really takes off and regenerates the comic fizz of the madcap
romantic comedies it otherwise meekly and predictably follows. You
can feel Heche's acting career leaping forward when her character
starts swallowing Zanax and spacing out in giggly fashion as the
storm intensifies. After the plane winds up on a beach with its
landing gear ruined, her zany life-raft scene confirms her comic
gifts. Ford's pilot sometimes plays wary and distanced. Heche's
peppery workaholic is always right there in his face, a funny,
sassy little atomic reactor.
</P>
<P>
   Just when they begin to get the hang of survivalism, the search
party they think is about to rescue them turns out to be a band of
murderous pirates. Thus, survival skills yield to fleeing skills
and romantic comedy yields to romantic adventure. Two less
resourceful actors would be in big trouble, given the script's
dropoff in wit and absence of surprise. Luckily, something else
takes over with Ford and Heche. At about the time you stop
believing in them as characters, you become intrigued, then
absorbed, by the way each persuades us they're taking us inside
their heads. They let us see the wheels turning as they find ways
to put fresh spin on material that grows more humdrum as the film
proceeds, divert us from the fact that sizzle is less than
abundant.
</P>
<P>
   Ford makes the film face up to the fact that he's nearly twice
Heche's age when he mumbles, after their mutual attraction becomes
too obvious not to acknowledge, that she deserves someone fresher.
But, of course, he then gets to make the case that he's got what it
takes, especially after he removes a snake that invades her shorts
when she's bathing in a river before they literally take the plunge
from a cliff into the sea to escape the pirates. The film's sex
scenes go to David Schwimmer, as the shallow fiance left back at
the resort by Heche's workaholic. Amusing despite the one-note
shallowness of his character, he says all the right things about
loving his fiancee, then gets drunk and beds the easygoing island
beauty (Jacqueline Obradors) with whom Ford's pilot had been
sleeping. ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' never seems freshly minted,
but Ford and Heche keep us watching it.

DRAPER ELEVATES RED WINGS IN OT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ There was a frown across Hockey Town for much of the
night. But chagrin almost magically turned to elation when the Red
Wings capped one of the most dramatic comebacks in recent Stanley
Cup history as Kris Draper nailed in a slapper 15:24 into overtime
for a 5-4 victory over the Washington Capitals Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Set up by Martin Lapointe in the slot, Draper belted in his
first goal of the postseason, a one-time slapper that handed the
reigning Cup champions a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven finals. Game
3 will be Saturday night at the MCI Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called anticipation,'' said a laughing Draper, asked what
he was doing in the slot, prepared to strike, when he's known as
one of Detroit's more reliable checking forwards. ``The truth was,
I kind of sneaked in there on a line change. We play a left wing
long (defensive scheme), but that by no means has to take away from
scoring chances. If I'd missed the shot, it just meant I would have
been the first guy digging back into the defensive zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings fell into what appeared a hopeless 3-1 hole in the
second period. Peter Bondra, Chris Simon, and former Bruin Adam
Oates beat Chris Osgood in a span of under 10 minutes, and it
seemed the Caps would go home with a split.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made too many soft plays in front of a very hungry team,''
said Caps coach Ron Wilson. ``We were stick-checking out there
instead of getting in their way.''
</P>
<P>
   In their four-game sweep of the Flyers in last year's finals,
the Wings trailed for a total of two minutes in the series. Here
they were against the Caps, down by two goals when the third period
began. Osgood was again looking shaky in the Detroit net. Slava
Kozlov was out with a charley horse. The Caps, without a doubt the
luckiest team in the playoffs this season, were threatening to make
a real series out of what most felt would be a fourth consecutive
sweep in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the Caps got out, 3-1,'' said Wings captain Steve
Yzerman. ``We really started to open up and take chances. The game
opened up for us because we got down. What caused it to open up was
the fact that we had to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wing return came amid a wild seesaw display of offense
by the two clubs. First, with 6:37 gone in the third, Yzerman cut
the gap to 3-2 when he knocked in a shorthanded goal _ the
league-leading sixth by the Wings this postseason. The Caps struck
right back, though, when ex-Bruin Joe Juneau drilled one in for the
4-2 lead only 28 seconds later, connecting on a steaming slapper
from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Safe again with a two-goal lead? Hardly. Only 63 seconds after
it was on the board, Lapointe cut the deficit back to one. Caps,
4-3, with 8:08 gone.
</P>
<P>
   What may have been the Capitals' last best chance to make a
series of this went wide right at 10:08 when Esa Tikkanen slipped
behind the defense and had 24 square feet of open net to shoot for
with Osgood still down from a save. But the crafty Tikkanen, no
more than 5 feet out in front of the net, inexplicably slid his
shot wide of the right post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the win right on Esa Tikkanen's stick, for God's
sake,'' said an exasperated Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time and math after that. With 4:14 left
in regulation, the Bay State's Doug Brown knocked in the equalizer,
unassisted, after taking possession on a turnover in the right
faceoff circle. The Wings were buzzing. The Caps were wheezing. The
Wings finished with a 20-7 shot lead for the period, and it only
got worse in the OT, when Detroit rolled up a 12-3 shot edge,
finishing the night with a 60-33 advantage. Emotionally, the Caps
were crushed, and their legs buckled in lockstep with their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Off the bench jumped Draper. In possession in the right circle,
Lapointe saw Draper racing in from the side and feathered his pass
into the slot. Olaf Kolzig didn't have a chance. In a flash, the
sellout crowd of 19,983 would be shaking down the memories of Howe,
Delvecchio, and Sawchuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoring goals is all about confidence,'' said Draper, stymied
for some six weeks. ``When you go without a goal, you doubt
yourself. But I felt if I kept shooting, it would go in. I just
didn't expect it would be the OT winner in the finals _ but I'll
take it.''

BENFICA RALLY OVERTAKES REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution lost. The crowd loved it.
</P>
<P>
   The 35,136 fans _ most of them wearing red and white to support
Benfica of the Portuguese first division _ whooped it up when their
team came from behind to stop the Revolution, 2-1, in Thursday
night's exhibition match at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't so much cheering against the Revolution as cheering
for Benfica. And they cheered for the show _ especially the two
late goals, both on free kicks, that decided the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we scored, there was a pretty good roar. When they
scored, it was even bigger,'' said Revolution goalkeeper Jeff
Causey.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a Revolution win. And after losing five straight Major
League Soccer games, they could have used one, even if it wouldn't
have counted in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Revolution gave Benfica, coming off a 3-1 victory
over the New York-New Jersey Metro-Stars Tuesday, all it could
handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that American mentality, always fighting,'' said Benfica
keeper Michel Preud'Homme, who started for Belgium in the 1994
World Cup. ``I like it. We are at the end of our season. We are
tired. For us, it's a friendly, but it was not a friendly at the
end of the game. It was serious out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It became decidedly more so when Carlos Rocha put back the
rebound of an Edwin Gorter shot that hit the post, breaking a
scoreless tie in the 53d minute. It was Rocha's first goal with the
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   And it riled up Benfica, which already had been getting its
share of shots on Causey, who had seven saves to Preud'Homme's two.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely did turn it on,'' said Causey. ``We knew they
were kind of tired. They had played a couple of nights before and
were traveling. They weren't going to be chasing our guys around.
But once we scored, it reminded them we were for real.''
</P>
<P>
   Benfica turned up the heat. Causey, making his first start since
the preseason, held his ground.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the ground to stop a header, denied a bid by Karel
Poborsky, and smothered a shot by Sergiy Kandaurov. Then he went up
high to get the ball with Joao Pinto charging in.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 76th minute, Benfica had a free kick from 40 yards
out. Midfielder Edwin Sanchez, who had entered the game in the 55th
minute, lined it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he's known for whacking a pretty good ball,'' said
Causey.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez got all of this one. It got by the wall of defenders and
beat Causey for the tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just hit one that eluded the wall and swerved as it came
toward me,'' Causey said. ``It was just a great hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez was not done yet. In the 87th minute, the Revolution
were called for another foul when Ulf Pringle went down just
outside the 18-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez set up again and fired again. The shot went off the
Revolution's Brian Dunseth and deflected into the corner of the net
to Causey's left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second one was pure luckiness,'' Causey said. ``Our guy
was standing there and it hit his foot and caught me moving the
wrong way. He may be known as a guy who can whack it, but if he's
known as a guy who can hit it into the middle and have it hit
someone and go in the near post, he's pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   While Benfica players packed up and signed autographs before
hitting the road for home, Revolution assistant coach Renato
Capobianco talked about having a light practice  &UR; today &LR;  with a home
game against Chicago coming up Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about being able to take positives out of this loss.
He liked the way his team did some things _ like getting the ball
out wide and finding space behind defenders _ that it had worked on
in recent days. And he liked the way Causey played, plus the
overall attacking, aggressive approach his team took.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went after them,'' he said. ``That's a positive sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Revolution will try to build on it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Pereja, a midfielder out of Colombia who was still
clearing up visa problems Wednesday, made his debut for the
Revolution and played the first 59 minutes ... Revolution head
coach Thomas Rongen is due back from his US World Cup team duties
for Sunday's afternoon game here. Rongen's plane is supposed to
land at 12:30 p.m. at Logan Airport. The game is at 3, and he flies
back to France at 6. He is expected to return for the Revolution's
game at New York-New Jersey June 24.

GOP CONGRESSIONAL VICTORIES MAY NOT LEAD TO SUCCESS AT THE POLLS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By stalling or diluting a succession of bills, from
stiff tobacco regulations to patients' rights to campaign finance
reform, Republicans on Capitol Hill have compiled an impressive
string of victories.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, analysts, and some GOP rank and file believe that
these warm-weather victories may spell doom for Republicans in the
autumn elections. Republicans, many say, are increasingly
projecting themselves as members of the party of inaction,
obstacles to popular proposals rather than agents of change.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP leadership has tried repeatedly to quash campaign
finance legislation in the House, even after conducting extensive
hearings last year into President Clinton's fund-raising practices.
Republicans have bogged down the tobacco legislation, and a final
vote remains elusive. And Republicans across Capitol Hill are
reticent about an overhaul of managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``One nightmare scenario is to go out there as a majority party
and take the sides of big tobacco against kids, health care
companies against patients, and with big-money interests against
reformers,'' said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar for the
American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   An influential Republican strategist said: ``The Democrats want
to position our guys as anti-minimum wage, pro-tobacco,
pro-insurance, and anti-campaign reform, and our side isn't doing a
lot to dispute this.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, facing a string of legislative defeats, have vowed
revenge in the fall. Initial strategy plans call for Democratic
congressional candidates to lump the issues together as they tag
Republican incumbents as part of a so-called ``do-nothing''
Congress wedded to large corporate interests like the tobacco and
health care industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have embarked on an agenda that is so narrow and so out
of sync with the rest of the country that they run a real risk of
not doing anything by the fall,'' said Laura Nichols, spokeswoman
for the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt. ``We intend to
make these issues part of the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold a slim 11-seat advantage in the House and a
55-45 majority in the Senate. History is against the Democrats.
Only once since the Civil War has the president's party gained
seats in a midterm election, in 1934, amid the Great Depression,
when Franklin D. Roosevelt was in office.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Republicans said they do not believe the public is
engaged in such issues as overhauling the campaign finance system
or regulating the tobacco industry _ not like education and crime,
the traditional areas of voter interest. Aides said Representative
John Linder of Georgia, head of the Republican National
Congressional Committee, held a series of forums over the Memorial
Day weekend and not one voter raised a point about campaign finance
or tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats have been trying to say we're evil on finance
reform since I can remember, and I can't find a single seat in the
last five cycles where anyone can say it made one percentage point
of difference in the outcome,'' said Ron Kaufman, a Republican
consultant and former political director in the Bush White House.
``I just don't see those being a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The RNCC communications director, Mary Crawford, &UR;  &LR; said, ``If you
ask members where those issues pop up, they will pretty unanimously
tell you they don't pop up at all.''
</P>
<P>
   On tobacco, Republicans in the House and Senate believe they
have effectively painted the issue as one of a tax increase, given
the $1.10 extra proposed for a pack of cigarettes. With that
perception firmly planted, they believe they are safe in opposing
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is whether it's a tax matter or a health
matter, and the Republicans are trying to drive home the tax
implications,'' said Dave Mason, a congressional analyst with the
Heritage Foundation, a right-leaning think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Even many Democratic candidates appear loath, at least at this
early stage, to focus on tobacco and campaign finance as key issues
in their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all talking about the Patient Bill of Rights and HMO
reform, education and more money for teachers and school
construction and maybe hitting a Republican for a voucher vote or
more student aid,'' said Amy Walter of the Cook Report, a political
newsletter in Washington. ``And they talk about Social Security,
and that's really it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans privately concede that they may be most vulnerable
on patients' rights, given the widespread disdain of health
maintenance organizations. Some members of the rank and file have
signaled to their leadership that Republicans must soften their
opposition and work through a compromise. In the meantime, senior
Republicans are accusing Democrats of wanting to return to
Clinton's 1994 concept of nationalized health care.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear is the impact of Clinton's ethical, legal, and
moral difficulties on the fall elections. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich has toned down his attacks on Clinton, and others appear
hesitant at lining up behind other chief Republican Clinton
antagonists like House majority leader Richard Armey of Texas and
Representative Dan Burton of Indiana, chairman of the House
Government Reform and Oversight Committee, especially at a time
when voters are indicating dwindling concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how that's going to play out,'' Crawford said of
Clinton's legal troubles. ``None of us do, because we don't know
what's there. From a political standpoint, we don't bank on it for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists believe that Gingrich, far more than the
individual issues, might be the GOP's most significant liability in
the autumn elections.

THOROUGHBRED RACING MOVES TO GAIN POPULARITY FOR THE SPORT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For five weeks every spring, thoroughbred racing dominates
television and press reports as the best 3-year-olds in the country
compete for the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   But the peaked, national interest is ephemeral. After the
Belmont Stakes in the first week of June, it largely evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   If thoroughbred racing is to capture a significant piece of the
national spotlight, many of its most devoted participants
increasingly say it must market itself to a much broader, younger
audience than the traditional handicapper, the stereotypical
railbird. And for the ``Sport of Kings'' to generate the excitement
of the pretelevision days when Citation and Whirlaway vied with
Williams and DiMaggio for space in the sports sections, many
believe it needs a storyline that the greater public can follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can develop some heroes in racing, if we get an
organization together that is going to push these heroes on a
national stage so that people have something in the sport they can
more readily identify with, then we would really be on to something
big from my point of view,'' said Don Little, of Centennial Farms,
a local owner and developer of racing syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   Such a national organization for thoroughbred racing may be at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   A product of two years of research the National Thoroughbred
Racing Association was officially established on April 1 to bring
to thoroughbred racing what NASCAR brought to stock car racing 50
years ago and what the NFL brought to professional football in the
1920s: structure and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally what we are doing is creating a national
structure and a brand for the sport, which it really has not had
before,'' said Tim Smith, the newly appointed commissioner and
chief economic officer of the NTRA.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughbred racing officials say the NTRA is the first national
organization in their sport that has united its diverse groups:
horse owners, track owners, trainers, jockeys, and breeders. Dues
have financed a $15 million advertising budget and a $500,000
public relations budget.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the NTRA launched the sport's first-ever national
advertising campaign. Like the NBA, with ``I love this game,'' and
the NHL, with ``Coolest game on earth,'' the NTRA has a slogan:
``Go baby go!'' The ads have appeared on television, largely
coordinated with the Triple Crown, and in USA Today, Sports
Illustrated, ESPN The Magazine, Rolling Stone, Swing, and Buzz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; cl10.5 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Having largely ignored the television boom in sports coverage
and battered by other betting outlets for the gambling public like
state lotteries and casinos, thoroughbred racing is in need of new
marketing tools. In appointing a top gun like Smith, many in the
sport hope it has finally established a ``league office,'' a united
voice for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly this has been tried before, but never with the
amount of support across the board that we have already received,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is a lawyer who worked in various posts in the Carter
administration, where he befriended Hamilton Jordan, who is now
chief executive of the Association of Tennis Professionals. Smith,
49, has worked with the organizing committee for the 1996 Summer
Olympic Games in Atlanta, the Professional Golfers' Association
Tour, and the ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk Downs is among 41 tracks nationwide _ including
Churchill Downs, Saratoga, Aqueduct and Santa Anita _ that have
signed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``What encourages us that this will be successful,'' said Bob
O'Malley, chief operating officer of Suffolk Downs, ``is that
industry groups that we have had before, for a long time, have been
more social clubs than bringing everyone together for business.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and O'Malley are working to make the major thoroughbred
racing attraction in Massachusetts, the MassCap, part of a
season-long racing schedule that generates significant interest and
significant national television exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fan is going to see something that looks a lot more like
NASCAR and the PGA tour,'' Smith said. ``It is going to be
something that is easier to follow, something that generates a
story line, with horses that fans can follow from race to race.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith says the NTRA hopes to have the new circuit up and running
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the new entity, things are looking up, a bit, at
Suffolk Downs, as attempts to turn the MassCap into a festival with
musical groups and boat cruises from Boston Harbor have drawn more
attention to the track. The average daily handle for this year's
spring dates, which ended June 6, was up 4 percent to $998,473, and
the average attendance increased by 2 percent to 4,455.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Malley says he is noticing somewhat of a younger crowd,
especially on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benefiting from an age of technology, younger people seem to
be caught up in the statistical analysis of racing,'' O'Malley
said. ``There was a time when people used to come to the track with
binoculars, and now they come in with laptops.''

NATIVES REFLECT ON WASHINGTON'S TOP RANKING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has often been said that the nation's capital is
a city of Southern efficiency and Northern charm. And that, it has
also been said, is putting it nicely.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia has long gotten poor grades for high
crime, low-quality schools, and a high cost of living. Yet Money
magazine rates Washington the No. 1 place to live in the Northeast.
Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scratched our heads a bit, too, when we first saw that
Washington came out as No. 1,'' Doug Dundas, a Money magazine
editor, said Thursday. ``But what pushed it over the top was the
vast number of museums and other cultural institutions that are in
the area.''
</P>
<P>
   That's still quite a rise, since Washington ranked at 162 out of
300 cities last year. But Dundas said the magazine's survey showed
that concern about crime had dropped, helping Washington skyrocket
to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who participated in our survey just weren't that
interested in crime this year as they have been in the past, so
crime had less weight this year,'' he said, adding that air quality
and clean water also had helped the district.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the magazine changed its format for rating the
cities, a switch that helped bump up Washington, Dundas said.
Rather than judge cities against one another, Money divided the
list into regions and population size for similar comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this new method is more useful,'' Dundas said. ``It
helps us compare like cities. Otherwise, we might get more big
cities on the top of the list and smaller cities at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise: Many Washingtonians said Thursday that they
agree with the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from the museums that always give you something to do,
you have the protection of the federal government here,'' said
Richard Q. Lewis, who lives in Capitol Heights and works in a
subway information booth. ``Also, this is a good area for
minorities. There is not as much racism, sexism or homophobia here.
Those things are not tolerated here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis added that the city's only major problem is ``the big gap
between the extremely poor and the extremely rich. But that's
something you deal with everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's high crime rate is not much different from those of
other cities, said Tawanna Jenkins, a domestic cleaner and a
Washington native from Capitol Hill. ``There's crime everywhere.
You can't get away from it in the big cities,'' she said. ``You
have to look at the whole picture, and DC is great. There's just so
much here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Monroe, a store clerk from Adams Morgan, agreed that the
city's highlights outweigh its problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something good and bad about every city, but overall
it is an interesting place to live.'' Monroe said.
</P>
<P>
   However, not everyone thought Washington is No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Nebinski, an insurance broker who lives across the Potomac
River in Great Falls, Va., and works in Washington, said he didn't
understand what the magazine sees in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think services in this city have a lot to be desired,
especially for the public school system,'' he said. ``As for
museums and cultural institutions, yes, that part is attractive,
but these museums were here long ago. The city hasn't really built
anything worthwhile as of late.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have a point. But then, the magazine survey wasn't
confined to just the District of Columbia, but also included nearby
``posh'' suburbs in Virginia and Maryland, certainly a boost for
the city, Dundas explained.
</P>
<P>
   Washington beat Boston, which Money says is No. 2.

MAINE'S INDEPENDENT GOVERNOR PROFITS FROM GOOD TIMES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH HARPSWELL, Maine _ The rising economic tide may not lift
all the boats, but it is swamping challengers who aim to dump
incumbents overboard.
</P>
<P>
   As the only independent among the nation's 50 governors, Angus
King was assured of challengers from two sides after his first
four-year term. But the remarkable surge of prosperity that has
lifted much of New England elevated King as well.
</P>
<P>
   And the laid-back, auburn-haired governor enjoys a level of
popularity that makes his defeat seem practically impossible. That
does not daunt Thomas Connolly, Scarborough lawyer, or James
Longley, a former 1st District congressman. Connolly won Tuesday's
Democratic primary by a 4-1 margin over Joseph Ricci. Longley,
whose father was a popular independent governor who left office 20
years ago, defeated Henry Joy and Leo Martin by taking two-thirds
of the GOP vote. But neither Connolly nor Longley got more than
about 30,000 votes statewide, which substantially dims their
prospects for November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bored Maine voters stay away in droves,'' admitted a Portland
Press Herald headline's assessment. If anger is the most powerful
motivating force in politics, it seems to be in short supply in
Maine. King's moderate, thrifty, probusiness approach seems to
mirror Maine's mood of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   He is liberal on social issues, conservative on fiscal affairs,
and worships, like almost all Maine politicians, at the feet of the
green god of environmentalism. What's not to like? seems to be the
attitude of most of the 1-million-plus Mainers.
</P>
<P>
   King's challengers set manfully to their task on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be one of the most heavily taxed states in the
US, even as our citizens continue to be among the lowest-earning,''
complained Longley. Running as a traditional conservative, Longley
bids to cut taxes by 20 percent and vows to drop the sales tax down
from 6 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly is a mainstream Democrat, appealing to the party's
traditional constituencies, and amplifies Longley's lament that
prosperity has not visited each Maine household equally. The Pine
Tree state lags 35 other states in per capita income. Six of
Maine's 16 counties ``are poorer than the poorest counties in the
poorest state in the country, Mississippi,'' Connolly claims.
</P>
<P>
   But Governor King seems to have spread his tent in the middle
ground of both parties, and his easygoing, mediagenic personality
helped smoothe out the inevitable rough spots he encountered during
his first four years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Maine likes its politicians polite, presentable, and respectful
of other points of view. From Ed Muskie to George Mitchell to Bill
Cohen, the voters have expressed a preference for pols who were
low-key, low-maintenance, and industrious. They don't like scandal,
harrumping, or highly charged rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   They know that winter comes after summer, that skies are cloudy
or stormy at least 43 percent of the time, on average, in this
latitude, and they know that trees fall, fish vanish, and the power
fails just when you wish it wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Creation and retention of jobs is a big deal in Maine, where the
traditional industries _ paper-making, shoes, fishing _ have
suffered losses. The newer industries _ in tourism, catalogue
sales, telephone call-centers, high tech _ have taken hold or
flourished under King's light-hand-on-the-tiller approach to
business regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Longley has needled King about the governor's reluctant backing
for a $60 million state tax abatement scheme approved to entice
Bath Iron Works to expand its shipbuilding facility. King argues
that he plays the role of a balance-wheel, trying to measure how
much tax money to give up against how many more jobs and tax-paying
salaries are involved in the trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of economics is hard to predict and harder still to
justify if the numbers get screwy, as in the type of swift, sharp
recessions that have periodically blitzed this rural,
high-energy-cost state at the end of the nation's industrial and
transportation pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   King won a narrow victory four years ago as the third candidate
in a field that was nearly evenly split. The topic then was how to
contain a big budget shortfall, and King's experience as a
businessman stood him in good stead with voters worried about
maintaining their family income in a lean time.
</P>
<P>
   Now the much more agreeable problem is what to do with a comfy
surplus in the state budget. Republicans prefer cutting taxes.
Democrats tend to want to expand services and spend tax money for
this group or that. King sits astride the debate in a position of
considerable leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Were he facing a large and unified majority in either branch of
the Legislature, as is the case of the Democrats' 4-1 margin over
Republican legislators in Massachusetts, King would have a much
tougher job. But Maine's Legislature is more evenly divided, and he
enjoys approval ratings only slightly below the astronomical.
</P>
<P>
   King says the idea of going to Washington as congressman or
senator holds no appeal for him, and so he limits his aspirations
to running the state, period.

SAMANTHA MORTON MAKES STUNNING DEBUT BY PURGING DEATH WITH SEX
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDER THE SKIN &QC; 
Directed and written by: Carine Adler &QC; 
Starring: Samantha Morton, Rita Tushingham, Claire Rushbrooke,
Stuart Townsend, Christine Tremarco, Matthew Delamere &QC; 
Running time: 85 minutes &QC; 
Unrated &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   British writer-director Carine Adler's ``Under the Skin''
emblazons the screen with the most startling and gripping film
debut by an actress since Emily Watson took our breath away with
her emotional nakedness in ``Breaking the Waves.'' Samantha
Morton's alternatingly keening and convulsive portrayal of a
daughter grieving for her mother in loose-cannon fashion is the
year's most powerful performance so far, overwhelming in its raw,
touching, invigorating immediacy. Yet while profound, the death of
a mother from a brain tumor isn't simple. It only complicates the
lifelong sibling rivalry between Morton's Iris and Claire
Rushbrook's Rose, her older sister.
</P>
<P>
   First the film breaks our heart with the muted stoicism of Rita
Tushingham as their suffering mother in her boxy little row house
in Liverpool. When she dies, Rose steals her mother's ring. Iris
steals her mother's ashes. It's their futile way of trying to keep
her around a little longer. Rose is at a crossroads, pregnant with
her first child, about to usher a new life into the world as she
ushers her mother out. Iris, a single woman, has no such
consolation or call to duty, and is under no obligation to hold
things together. And so she doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   When she reacts, it's with rage and heedlessness. She claps on
her mother's blond wig, envelops herself in her mother's coat, and
tries to drive out her grief with nonstop casual sex with an
intensity that borders on the grotesque. Between them, Adler and
Morton convince us that there's nothing histrionic and everything
primal about Iris's frenzied hurling of her body against the same
natural order that took her mother. She's so far inside her own
torment that she seems unaware of the details of her flailings,
even when one man abuses her horribly and she becomes the victim of
a mugging. Even then, the furies driving her aren't quite tamed.
</P>
<P>
   But dropping her dependable boyfriend, as she does when she
picks up a man at the movies and begins her headlong attempt to
purge grief with sex, isn't enough. She realizes this when her
feelings reach their peak in embittered exchanges with her sister.
As played by Rushbrook, who will be remembered from ``Secrets &AMP;
Lies,'' Rose finds something jarred loose in herself by the
spectacle of Iris's self-lacerating odyssey. It's clear that
neither will arrive at anything resembling consolation until and
unless they can do so with each other. Few _ if any _ films will
hit you with the raw emotional urgency Morton delivers in ``Under
the Skin.'' It's an extraordinary evocation of pain and catharsis.

   KURT AND COURTNEY
</P>
<P>
   A documetary by Nick Broomfield
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 95 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Rating: Unrated
</P>
<P>
   If Courtney Love had her druthers, no one would be reading this
review of ``Kurt and Courtney.''
</P>
<P>
   If the singer-actress had her way, there would be no review
because there never would have been a movie about her tumultuous
marriage to Kurt Cobain, lead singer and guitarist of the seminal
band Nirvana, or the insidious theories that have sprung up since
his death in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   So much of Nick Broomfield's documentary, ``Kurt and Courtney''
concerns Love's efforts to block the film's completion and
distribution _ she got it booted off the bill at this year's
Sundance Film Festival _ that it's a wonder he didn't call the
movie, ``Courtney and Me.'' The rest of the film, an arresting,
darkly comic horror show of junkies, irate ex-lovers, and freaks,
portrays Love as a bullying, manipulative fame-hungry shrew, a
malevolent grunge-girl Lady Macbeth who may have played a role in
her husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   On April 8, 1994, an electrician discovered the body of the
27-year-old Cobain in his Seattle home. Found next to his body was
drug paraphernalia, a rambling note, and the shotgun police believe
Cobain used to take his own life. Cobain's death was jarring and
tragic, but hardly seemed unexpected. Suicide was a recurring theme
in his songs _ ``Milk It'' from 1993's ``In Utero,'' featured the
line ``Look on the bright side is suicide'' _ and Cobain often
complained about the dual pressures of his sudden, worldwide
success, and a drug problem he couldn't seem to shake.
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner had the last candles flicked out at makeshift
memorials than conspiracy theorists came out of the woodwork with
Web sites and books devoted to uncovering nefarious plots
supposedly hatched by Love to do away with Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Cobain's death, Love was seen as the Yoko Ono of the
grunge generation, another attention-seeking viper sinking her
teeth into the rock god of the day. Love already fronted her own
band, Hole (which released an acclaimed album ``Live Through
This,'' days after Cobain's death), but marrying the Nirvana
frontman instantly made her more than just another guitar-slinging
musician waiting for her big break.
</P>
<P>
   For Broomfield, finding Love's enemies proves as easy as finding
a double mocha latte in Seattle. There's the ex-boyfriend, an
especially bitter failed musician, who says of Love, ``a kinder,
gentler Charlie Manson is still (expletive) Charlie Manson,''
referring to Love's slinky designer makeover. There's a former
nanny to the couple's daughter Frances, who claims Love constantly
nagged Cobain about the contents of his will in the weeks before
his death.
</P>
<P>
   Others maintain the Cobain-Love marriage was on the rocks, and
that Cobain intended to file for divorce, giving Love some motive
for having her husband murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield doesn't believe Love arranged Cobain's murder. He
doesn't need to _ there are enough others, including Tom Grant, a
private investigator originally hired to find Cobain after he
skipped out of a Los Angeles drug treatment facility days before
his death. Grant is now one of the leading murder conspiracy
theorists. There's El Duce, who looks like an extra from
``Deliverance,'' and was, before his death shortly after talking to
Broomfield, the leader of some sort of S&AMP;M thrash band, who says
Love offered him $50,000 to ``whack'' Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   But none are as terrifying or unsettling as Hank Harrison,
Love's father. A former Grateful Dead roadie who once used pit
bulls to discipline his daughter, Harrison has found a career in
writing books branding Love a murderer. He screams into the camera
exactly what he will do to Love if she tries any legal tricks to
stop him, and once you stop laughing, your mouth will be slack with
horror. In another life, Love and Harrison would be duking it out
on the ``Jerry Springer Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's gentler moments are ephemeral, such as an interview
with Cobain's aunt who gave her nephew his first guitar, and still
treasures recordings of his earliest musical efforts. That's almost
all that's heard of Cobain's music since Love wouldn't allow any
Nirvana music in the film. Never a woman to be trifled with, Love
pulls out every diva trick short of biblical plagues to keep
Broomfield from completing his film. Somehow, Broomfield, who seems
smarmyhimself, never elicits much sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield's sources are hardly the most reliable people, and
there are no conversations with those who spent a great deal of
time with Cobain, including his former Nirvana bandmates Dave
Grohl, now of Foo Fighters, and Krist Novoselic. He tries to hijack
an interview fromLove at an American Civil Liberties Union dinner,
but she's just not having it.
</P>
<P>
   Is Love ill-tempered and difficult? Without a doubt. But in all
likelihood, Kurt Cobain was a tremendously talented, but deeply
troubled man, who, under the strain of his career, perhaps a
failing marriage, and the influence of drugs, blew his head off one
April day. For all the dust it kicks up, ``Kurt and Courtney''
doesn't uncover any dark truths about Cobain's sad end. Mainly,
it's a nightmarish tour, guided by bottom-feeders, through the
sleazy underbelly of fame. It's as grisly as a multi-car pileup,
and just as luridly fascinating to watch.

A MAN TAUGHT TO KILL FOR A CAUSE LOSES HIS CONVICTION

   THE BREAK
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Robert Dornhelm
</P>
<P>
   Written by Ronan Bennett, based on an idea by Stephen Rea
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Stephen Rea, Alfred Molina, Rosana Pastor, and Brendan
Gleeson
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 96 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Rating: Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Rea has a face like an emotional weather map, on which
every crag, every angle, every furrow is etched with indelible
sorrow. The eyes brood and mourn; the gaze is funereal. And that's
a good thing in ``The Break,'' because the best parts of this
political thriller unfold on the actor's face, which subtly and
stoically communicates more about the conflicted soul of an IRA
terrorist than the thin plot and clipped dialogue of Ronan
Bennett's screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   The film starts with an intriguing notion: What happens when a
man who was raised to hate and taught to kill loses his conviction
for the cause? Can he make the psychological break after he has
made his literal escape from prison, in this case the notorious
H-Block in Northern Ireland's Maze Prison? Certainly, he can get a
fake passport and cross the Atlantic, but can he vanquish memory,
unlearn old habits, build a new life? He can break out, but can he
break free?
</P>
<P>
   Rea is best known for his intense performance as the inscrutable
gunman in ``The Crying Game,'' and ``The Break'' is based on his
original idea. It opens within the drab, concrete walls of the
prison, where Rea's character, Sean Dowd, joins a group of inmates
who overcome the prison guards. The escape from the high-security
jail is pulled off with unlikely ease, and the film overall has a
breezy naivete about the complex world of political terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Dowd flees to New York, where he is befriended by a family of
Guatemalan refugees harboring secrets of their own. Alfred Molina
plays a salt-of-the-earth dishwasher who saves Dowd's life, and
Rosana Pastor is his sultry sister Monica, who falls in love with
Dowd in about two seconds. They are plotting to assassinate a
vicious killer from their native land, and Dowd is faced with a
choice: Should he use his covert skill to help these earnest
amateurs or should he come clean for good?
</P>
<P>
   It's an intriguing dilemma that never achieves its promise,
though. Director Robert Dornhelm shoots two equally claustrophobic
worlds, from the drab, bleak shots of Ireland to dark, shabby
interiors of an utterly unromantic New York. There is no air, no
light in either environment, perhaps because the characters are
suffocated by the shadows of the past. The dialogue is clipped,
terse, economical to a fault, as if language threatens to reveal
too much. Apart from the assassination plot, the conflict here is
interior, played out in Dowd's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Rea is perfectly cast, and he is absolutely
fascinating to watch. In one scene, he lies alone in a bare
rent-by-the-night hotel room, drinking from a cheap bottle of
whiskey; he pulls the bottle to his lips, and you know instantly
this is a haunted soul, the ultimate outcast. When he connects with
Monica, he cringes at the mere suggestion of feeling. As outcasts
from another culture, Molina and Pastor are earthy types, but
they're more like outlines than full-bodied characters. Plus, their
``political'' situation is vague and absurd, like an un- &QC; 
schooled novelist's version of upheaval in an unfamiliar territory.
</P>
<P>
   There is very little political detail in this purportedly
political story, and the lack of research weakens its premise. The
machinations of age-old conflicts are far too complex to be brushed
off with sketchy plot devices, instant romances, and crimes that
are made too simple. When the inevitable happens, a law officer
brushes it off as ``some Irish thing,'' with the same inexplicable
nonchalance that permeates ``The Break.'' There is an opportunity
lost with this film, especially when the recent peace agreement in
Ireland leaves many wondering what happens when the cause ceases to
exist, on paper or in the mind. No doubt, that dilemma is fodder
for future films, but in ``The Break'' we get only a glimmer of
that conflict, seen in the shadows of Rea's changing face.

HACKER LEGEND OF 1988 BECOMES NEWEST INTERNET MILLIONAIRE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; An intriguing social note arises from this week's $49 million
takeover of Cambridge's Viaweb by Internet search engine giant
Yahoo! Inc. One of Viaweb's three co-founders _ and doubtless one
of Viaweb's newly minted paper millionaires _ is convicted computer
felon Robert Tappan Morris.
</P>
<P>
   You don't remember Robert Morris? The Justice Department does.
He was the 24-year-old programming genius who unleashed the famous
Internet ``worm'' of 1988, a virus launched from an MIT computer
that crippled an estimated 6,000 computers, includin sensitive
hardware owned by NASA and the Department of Defense. His defense
lawyers argued that an error caused the rogue program to go
berserk. Government prosecutors told the court that Morris had
stolen hundreds of computer passwords and tried to disguise the
program's origins so it could not be traced to him at Cornell
University, where he was then a graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Morris was convicted of computer fraud, fined $10,000,
and sentenced to three years' probation and 400 hours of community
service. Ironically, Morris is credited with putting the Internet
on the map. ``Not a lot of people on the street had heard that word
before the trial,'' says Viaweb cofounder Paul Graham. At the time
of Morris's prank, the outside world had virtually zero knowledge
or understanding of the communications system that linked
practically all of the country's major computing centers. Now we
know.
</P>
<P>
   Graham says that Morris, now finishing up his PhD in computer
science at Harvard, ``is the most upstanding guy I know.'' Morris
is hardly the only computer miscreant to have become a productive
member of society. Former MIT student David LaMacchia, whom the
government accused of computer piracy when he posted copyrighted
software programs on his electronic bulletin board, had the charges
against him dismissed in 1994 and now works for Oracle. Two other
members of the hacker elite, Kevin Poulsen and Randal Schwartz,
have sought the ultimate refuge of the congenital sociopath _
they've become columnists.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, widely hailed as a genius in the Perl programming
language, writes a column for a publication called Web
Techniques. &UR;  &LR; His Internet home page
(www.lightlink.com/spacenka/fors/) has all the details of his 1995
felony conviction under Oregon's computer crime law, and provides
an opportunity to contribute to his legal defense fund. Poulsen
became a fugitive from justice _ and a hacker legend _ after he
managed to gain access to records of sensitive FBI investigations
in the mid-1980s. While fleeing the feds, Poulsen, widely known by
his log-on ``Dark Dante,'' supported himself by successfully
rigging radio phone-in contests, winning a vacation to Hawaii and a
Porsche in the process. He was eventually caught and imprisoned for
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Poulsen's web site (www.catalog.com/kevin/) has an entry,
``Kevin Sells Out to Corporate America,'' which allows visitors to
access his weekly column at ZDTV.com, appropriately titled, ``Chaos
Theory.'' In his most recent outing, Poulsen warns readers that his
``normally unassailable objectivity should be suspect this week.''
That's because he's writing about another famous computer felon,
the still-imprisoned Kevin Mitnick.

   Classicists everywhere were shocked and appalled to see
Bloomingdale's hyping Master of the Universe cuff links for
Father's Day ... with an astonishing Latin error. The $50
chatchkas, advertised in The New York Times, display the phrase,
``Veni, Vedi, Vici.'' The Bloomies ad copy states that this is
Julius Caesar's famous line, ``I came, I saw, I conquered,'' which
is actually spelled, ``Veni, Vidi, Vici.''
</P>

   Bloomingdale's executive Anne Keating says the vendor, Swank, is
``very embarrassed'' by the spelling gaffe and that the store is
removing the cuff links from the sales floor. Corrected links will
be available next week. But what do the cuff links say? We called
in TGIF's Special Dead Languages Consultant, Caroline Caswell of
Latin Academy, to translate the bungled quote. ``Vedi' could be the
vocative for the Etruscan god of the underworld, Vedius,'' Ms.
Caswell explained. ``So the phrase could read, `I came, Vedius, I
conquered' ... but why? Somebody didn't do their homework.''

A COMEDY OF INSECURITY IN THE BIG CITY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MR. JEALOUSY &QC; 
Written and directed by: Noah Baumbach &QC; 
Starring: Eric Stoltz, Annabella Sciorra, Chris Eigeman, Carlos
Jacott, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Berian Kerwin, Peter Bogdanovich,
Bridget Fonda, John Lehr &QC; 
Running time: 105 minutes &QC; 
Rated: R (language) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Until it thins out and is beached on the increasingly
unrewarding self-absorption of its characters, Noah Baumbach's
``Mr. Jealousy'' provides ample evidence that his debut feature,
``Kicking and Screaming,'' was no fluke. He fills the screen with
bright Manhattan neurotics led by Eric Stoltz's romantically
blundering title-roleist and Annabella Sciorra's incandescent art
historian working as a tour guide in the Brooklyn Museum. For the
film's first half at least, he keeps us hooked as he traces their
rocky relationships, past and present. It's the past that makes
trouble for Stoltz's insecure would-be writer. His obsession with
the ex-lovers of Sciorra's less-messed-up love interest keeps
getting in his way.
</P>
<P>
   He knows it, knows he needs help, but when he goes after it,
it's because he wants to get inside the head of Sciorra's ex-lover,
whose presence in her history is all the more galling to Stoltz
because the guy happens to be a best-selling writer. To feed his
obsession with spying on her, he joins the ex-boyfriend's therapy
group, assuming the name and history of his buddy, Carlos Jacott's
Vince, who's filled with enough of his own qualms about marrying
his own girlfriend. Sciorra's insecure but emotionally tough and
honest Brooklyn girl is easier to take than Stoltz's hapless dope,
whose one-note narrowness provides a real test of the actor's
ability to divert us with soft charm.
</P>
<P>
   As the deceptions escalate, the comedy of insecurity quickly
hits a point of diminishing returns before deflating in a farcical
climax outside the therapist's office when everyone confronts
everyone else. One of the surprises that keeps the deflation at
bay, however, is the way Stoltz's drolly named Lester Grimm becomes
friends, against his better judgment, with the quarry he hates. But
his rival, astutely and alertly played by Whit Stillman regular
Chris Eigeman, convinces us he's smarter and more sensitive than
Lester cares to admit, but finally does. He's the film's most
unpredictable element, but the ensemble quality is high and
likable, even if Baumbach's inventiveness as a writer falters after
the film's sweet, savvy beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Names, by the way, are only one of the forms of homage Baumbach
works into ``Mr. Jealousy.'' Baumbach, son of critics and scholars
Jonathan Baumbach and Georgia Brown, cut his teeth on films, loves
them, and has worked into this film a number of salutes. These
range from such stylistic flourishes as wipes and irises, a snatch
of music from ``Jules and Jim,'' a voice-over by Baumbach, a
genuflection to his parents, a nicely gauged performance by Peter
Bogdanovich as the therapist, and a plot turn that hinges on
knowing whether ``The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'' was shot in
color or black and white. He has also appropriated and rendered
into contemporary New Yorkese the French New Wave's rueful sense of
the messy overlaps of love lives, which it in turn learned from the
great Jean Renoir, to whose benevolence and embrace of his
characters Baumbach is winningly attuned. May his next film arrive
soon.

OLYMPIA DUKAKIS ASSESSES TITLE ROLE IN ALL-WOMEN ``LEAR''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Olympia Dukakis has played plenty of mothers in her 40 years of
acting, from her Oscar-winning performance as the matriarch in
``Moonstruck'' to Amanda Wingfield in ``The Glass Menagerie.'' She
raised three children of her own and nursed her mother when she was
confined to a home for senior citizens. So motherhood is familiar
territory. But at 66, the actress never expected to be appearing as
parent to the likes of Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia, the trio of
sisters in Shakespeare's tragedy ``King Lear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' she says, ``I'm not someone who has been running
around all of my life saying I wanted to play this role.'' But
protests aside, she is, in fact, playing the aging monarch in ``The
Lear Project,'' a joint production of Shakespeare and Company and
the Orpheum Theatre-Foxborough. Dukakis isn't doing the role in
drag: Her Lear is every inch a queen, a mother and ruler who
decides to give up her kingdom in her declining years. Lear is one
of the most captivating roles in dramatic literature, and it
resonates for Dukakis in more ways than one. ``Aging is a big part
of it,'' she says. ``I had a mother who passed away a few years ago
at 93, and I was very present during her aging process. I saw her
struggle to find a place of peace. It's very interesting what
happens. There is an accumulation of a lifetime, the evaluation of
a life, the accounting one takes.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as her mother used to say, Dukakis is ``no spring
chicken,'' which makes this project ``a mountain to climb, complex
and profound, but terribly moving.'' This particular expedition
began a year ago, when Dukakis agreed to try the gender-bending
role at the suggestion of Shakespeare and Company's cofounder
Dennis Krausnick. Dukakis's daughter, Christina Zorich, is in
training with the company in Lenox, and she plays Cordelia to her
mother's Lear. The troupe is exploring the play through a female
point of view, probing a woman's struggle with power and dynasty as
well as her complex relationship with her daughters and with the
Fool (played by another woman, the estimable Tina Packer).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very dangerous: We're really courting fear and
humiliation here,'' Dukakis says, without a trace of fear in her
deep, throaty voice. This is a woman who has played contemporary
roles and classics on Broadway and in regional theaters nationwide
(she opens in the title role of Euripides's ``Hecuba'' at the
Williamstown Theatre Festival later this summer) and who has
garnered considerable credits on both the small and large screens.
You don't expect fear and humiliation from Dukakis. Intensity, yes.
Passion, yes. Fear? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Lear Project'' comes when Dukakis is taking stock of
her life. A child of Greek immigrants (and cousin of former
governor Michael Dukakis) who was raised in Lowell, she's at that
point in her career when she's long past ingenues but not quite
ready for doting grandmothers. The no-spring-chicken dilemma. Men
get to look forward to Lear, to Prospero, to Vanya. With women,
it's another story. ``In contemporary drama, most of the roles for
older women don't have complexity, don't have challenges,'' she
says. ``As a matter of fact, most commercial parts are trivialized
or ridiculed. Older women don't get a chance to see themselves up
there, and younger women don't get a chance to see what's
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, she finds it thrilling to work so closely with
her daughter, who has never performed Shakespeare before. ``It's
great to watch her, and everything is easier,'' she notes. The
real-life link enhances the relationship onstage: ``It's easier to
be offended by her, to be moved by her, to love her. The
mother-daughter relationship is very different from the
father-daughter relationship. At times, it can be more fierce and
more vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The role raises never-ending questions. ``What happens to a
woman in order to rule and to succeed in her world? What kind of
skills does she have to learn? What does that do to her as a
woman?'' Dukakis keeps the questions coming. ``What happens to a
woman in a world dominated by men?''
</P>
<P>
   By extension, what happens to ordinary women of a certain age in
contemporary society? Dukakis doesn't ask that one herself, but she
answers it. ``I'm interested in ways women are trying to figure out
how to function in a world that is seen through a male lens,'' she
says. ``Often, they're not needed or respected, but they're also
complicit in silencing themselves. It's too easy to say, `Oh, well,
we live in a patriarchal world. They did this, or they did that.'
But the truth is, we're very complicit in it. More and more, women
_ especially someone like me, who has raised two sons and a
daughter _ are saying, `How do I really want to live and be known?'
as opposed to how the world tells me I should be known or how I
should please others.''
</P>
<P>
   But for 40 years, she has worked in a business that is all about
... ``about pleasing!'' she says, finishing the thought. ``I don't
have the answers, but I'm beginning to find the questions. That's
pretty good. First we gotta get the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the questions are rooted in the mother she is and
the mothers she has played. ``The end of nurturing is not the end
of growing,'' she says. ``Your children leaving the house is not
the end of all things that will transform you and change you.'' A
pause. ``As my husband says, the dog barks and the caravan moves
on. It's not over. The caravan just keeps going.'' In this case, it
moves up that mountain to the world of Lear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lear Project'' is at the Orpheum Theatre-Foxborough June
16-21 and at Shakespeare and Company in Lenox June 23-28.

<P>
   &UR; FEATURE STORIES  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MACHO-MUSIC (Undated) _ One of the fundamental myths of rock was
that it was essentially a man's game, a macho sport that knocked a
generation of unctuous crooning mama's boys out of the batter's box
of popular culture and allowed ``real'' men to step to the
pop-music plate. Girls who sought membership in this boys' club had
better be butch. But even performers like Patti Smith and Joan
Jett, who affected male bravado, were never fully accepted into the
highest reaches of rock's pantheon. The reality behind that myth,
of course, is something quite different. By Stephen Holden.
</P>
<P>
   TALKING-ART-BOWIE (Undated) _ Talking art with David Bowie: A
musician's parallel passion. By Michael Kimmelman. (Editors: This
is the first in an occasional series of talks with people who, in
one way or another, have a special connection to art but aren't
(primarily) artists themselves: writers, musicians, scientists,
politicians, collectors.) By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECTURE-VINOLY (Undated) _ Even though Rafael Vinoly is the
most elegant architect now practicing in the United States, he
probably doesn't want to hear about it. The elegance of his work is
ascetic as well as esthetic. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-SHAKESPEARE (New York) _ There probably isn't a scholar or
critic in the world who would rate ``Henry VIII'' as one of
Shakespeare's great history plays. Yet as presented by the Royal
Shakespeare Company during its recent 18-day residency at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, ``Henry VIII'' is suddenly revealed to
be a vivid and compelling theatrical artifact. By Vincent Canby.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-FIRST-RUN (Undated) _ Altogether it has been a
high-profile month for First Run Features. Once again the small New
York film and video distributor is succeeding in acting a little
too big for its acquisition budget. By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   KEN-LOACH-MOVIES (London) _ Surprisingly, perhaps, given his
distaste for the prevailing social order, Ken Loach was never an
angry young man. Shy and soft-spoken, he was almost 30 by the time
he set off down the path that three decades later would earn him
recognition in Europe as the dean of leftist movie makers. By Alan
Riding. Moved.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-TWEENERS (Undated) _ Hollywood hasn't quite given up on
the tweens _the 9- to 12-year-olds _ but it is as perplexed about
how to entertain them as parents are about how to rear them.
``There's very little being made anymore for the tweeners,'' says
Terry Press, head of marketing for Dreamworks. ``We figure they are
either going to be dragged to `Quest for Camelot' with their
younger siblings or they reach 8 and want to see `Titanic' and
everything else. They've really become a niche market.'' By Michele
Willens.
</P>
<P>
   ALY-SHEEDY-MOVIES (Undated) _ To Americans, Aly Sheedy is still
the shining conscience of the Brat Pack of the 1980s, the sprightly
valentine at the center of classic films about the transition to
adulthood like ``The Breakfast Club'' and ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' the
touchstone for a million awkward adolescences. She is the farthest
thing imaginable from a middle-aged lesbian drug addict
photographer, which is what she plays in ``High Art.'' By Margy
Rochlin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DANCE-JACOBS-PILLOW (Undated) _ On June 23, when the nation's
oldest summer dance festival opens in tiny Becket, Mass., it will
have a new director, Ella Baff. Running Jacob's Pillow Dance
Festival is hard work, but Ms. Baff is full of ambitious visions.
By Jennifer Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COLTRANE-JAZZ (New York) _ It is a perfect indicator of jazz's
restricted place in American society that Ravi Coltrane _ who is
the son of John Coltrane _was nobody special as a boy growing up in
Woodland Hills, a suburb of Los Angeles, far away from the bohemian
world. By Ben Ratliff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-THORNBIRDS-CHAMBERLAIN (Undated) _ Richard Chamberlain talks
about the series that captivated a country in 1983 on the eve of
its revival. By Anita Gates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES-WODEHOUSE (Undated) _ In 1927, when James H. Heineman
was 10, he demonstrated a bibliographic bent: he began buying first
editions of the novels of his favorite author, the British writer
P.G. Wodehouse, whose works poked fun at bumbling English
aristocrats. Over the next 60 years, Heineman continued to buy the
works of Wodehouse, amassing a collection of some 6,300 items. Next
Sunday, Heineman's entire Wodehouse collection goes on view for the
first time at Sotheby's in New York, where it will be auctioned in
150 lots on June 26. By Rita Reif.
</P>
<P>
   FLAMENCO-DANCE (New York) _ It was not a dream. Late one night
last month, at Tunnel, a club in lower Manhattan, the deejay threw
a curve. For several hours a group of young men and women had been
gyrating to hip-hop, house and techno music when, out of the blue,
a passionate song sung by Alejandro Sanz filled the room. Without
missing a beat, the dancers' posture changed. They lifted their
chests, placed their hands on their waists and prepared for a fiery
flamenco. Then, fingers clicking, hips swiveling, feet pounding,
they had a go at it. They sizzled. And why not? Flamenco is hot. By
Valerie Gladstone.
</P>
<P>
   MANZE-MUSIC (Undated) _ If two new CDs by the English violinist
Andrew Manze are any indication, early music may finally be
shedding one of classical music's most venerable but useless
assumptions. To wit, the funny notion abroad among classical-music
reviewers that the best thing a performer can do is disappear. By
Richard Taruskin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL (`t' category) &LR;
</P>

   TRAVEL-PORTUGAL-CASTLES (Undated) _ Exploring the cobblestone
streets and medieval castles of Portugal's hilltop towns. By

   TRAVEL-PORTUGAL-EXPO (Lisbon) _ Lisbon looks to the future as
well as to its glorious maritime past with Expo '98. By Alan

won't fly and can't drive? Very slowly. By Betsy Wade.

Habitat for Humanity's Jimmy Carter Work Project. The project began
in 1984 when Carter worked at a Habitat site in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Each year the project visits a different city, and Carter and
his wife, Rosalynn, join volunteers to help build homes and raise
awareness of the need for low-cost housing. This year, volunteers
will build 100 homes in one week in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the largest Habitat project ever conducted in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without them, we couldn't do it. It physically couldn't be
done,'' said Rev. Michael Shirl, executive director of Houston
Habitat for Humanity. Shirl added that hiring subcontractors to do
the work would add $12,000 to $15,000 to each home's cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens (during construction) is friendships are built,
relationships are built, and everyone begins to learn about each
other. Before you know it, people are having a good time, and they
walk out of it with relationships that last a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kirkpatricks, family ties will be renewed when Gretchen
Kirkpatrick's mother, Carol Gregory, and aunt, Dixie Conner, take
time off work to help out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Gregory, director of Habitat affiliates in the
Atlanta area, who persuaded Gretchen to get involved in the
project. When she called and said she would be working on the
Houston project, Kirkpatrick decided to pitch in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been the kind of person who would give a dollar
... but I've never gone out and volunteered,'' Kirkpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her mom, who has spent 13 years with Habitat, told her
to anticipate 12-hour workdays in the Houston heat and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we won't suffer any sunburn,'' Kirkpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   The heat also concerns project planner Becky Neuhaus, who is in
charge of coordinating transportation, housing, hospitality and
food _ especially the more than 40,000 gallons of water volunteers
will drink during the week. Also lined up are air-conditioned
first-aid trailers at each site.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the goodie bags, we have tips to stay healthy during this
(heat),'' Neuhaus said.
</P>
<P>
   The project actually began about two years ago, when Milby Hart
and other volunteers canvassed inner-city areas looking for land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inner-city development requires an inordinate amount of
work,'' said Hart, a Houston attorney who has volunteered with
Habitat for 11 years. ``It requires patience, planning and
perseverance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart said he has cut back his hours at his practice during
recent months as the project week neared.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wouldn't trade it for the world,'' Hart said. ``You feel
good. You feel productive. You feel valuable. You feel like you're
making a bona fide effort to improve the quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkpatrick said she felt privileged to participate. ``When I
walk away, I can say, `I helped build that house, and this family
is going to have a comfortable place to live.' That, in and of
itself, is a privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuhaus echoed that thought. ``It's something you don't get to
do every day. It's getting out there in the fresh air and being
with your friends. It's a really great experience.''
</P>

   CIR-WEB-FILTERS-NYT (Undated) _ The American Family Association,
a conservative Christian group, has strongly supported filtering
products, software meant to cordon off X-rated and other nasty
corners of the Internet from users, especially children. So it was
with some surprise that AFA officials discovered that their group's
own Web pages were being lumped together with skinhead, white
supremacist and other ``intolerant'' sites blocked by a popular
filter called Cyber Patrol. By Pamela Mendels. Moved 6-10. WITH

<P>
   CUBA-JEWS-ART-HNS (Havana) _ Before the 1959 revolution, some
15,000 Jews lived in Cuba. Thousands fled when Castro took over,
and those who remained faced the near-extinction of their faith and
culture. But in recent years there has been a growing renewal of
Cuba's small, impoverished Jewish community. That renaissance
continues, thanks in large measure to tireless assistance from
American Jews. By Cecile S. Holmes. Moved 6-9. WITH PHOTO.

   CANTORS-CONCERT-REVIEW-NYT (New York) _ To commemorate the 50th

turbulent times of his pontificate and the architect of
rapprochement with the communist world. By Alessandra Stanley.
Moved 6-9.
</P>
<P>
   ISLAM-BOMB-REVIEW-NYT (Washington) _ For more than two decades,
the prospect that a Muslim country could possess nuclear weapons
has often been summed up in two words _ ``Islamic bomb'' _ a phrase
that captured the imagination of some and terrified others. But is
there such a thing as a bomb that exists for the sake of Islam and
for the destruction of Israel? Or do the phrase and the oratory
about it reveal other things instead _ a hunger and rivalry for
greatness by major Islamic countries, and the depth of Israel's
anxieties? By Elaine Sciolino. Moved 6-6.

   BAPTISTS-NYT (Salt Lake City) _ The Southern Baptist Convention,

effort to convert Jews is in full swing. James Sibley, hired by the

<P>
   BAPTISTS-C0NVERT-COX (Undated) _ The Southern Baptist blitz is
on in the home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Southern Baptists from across the nation, meeting for their
national convention in Salt Lake City, are taking part in an effort
to persuade Mormons to change their beliefs, to reach the
unchurched with the gospel of Jesus and maybe to win back some
Southern Baptists who converted to Mormonism. By Kim Sue Lia
Perkes. Moved 6-8.
</P>
<P>
   BAPTISTS-MORMONS-NYT (Salt Lake City) _ Call it a confrontation
between the confident and the convinced. For the past week,
Southern Baptists have been gathering here in the capital of the

   RELIGION-COLUMN-NYT (New York) _ Can competition's benefits for
sports, business and government be similarly realized in organized
religion? Yes, replies Rodney Stark, a professor of sociology and
comparative religion at the University of Washington, who recently
published the results of a study making that case. Among Stark's
findings was that the areas of the country that had recently

<P>
   FILOLI, Calif. _ Nestled in the hills and woods of Woodside, 25
miles south of San Francisco, is a hidden gem inviting visitors to
step into California's past.
</P>
<P>
   It's Filoli, an 80-year-old, 654-acre estate with mansion and
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, this property of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation in the United States, is not overrun with tourists.
It's definitely worth a side trip on your next visit to the San
Francisco area, especially if gorgeous gardens and historic homes
are your passion.
</P>
<P>
   It's brimming with beautiful spaces lush with gorgeous flowers,
roses, plants, bushes, herbs, vegetables, hedges, trees and lawns
throughout the 16-acre gardens and offers a peace and serenity
rarely found at a visitors' attraction. The gardens, designed by
two native Californians to complement the house, have been arranged
with both casual and formal features to take advantage of the
natural surroundings and vistas.
</P>
<P>
   The estate and gardens were built by William Bowers Bourn II, a
native San Franciscan who, during his three years at Cambridge
University, admired the style and architecture of the houses and
gardens of England.
</P>
<P>
   The modified Georgian residence was designed by Bourn's friend
and architect Willis Polk. Construction began in 1915, and William
and Agnes Bourn moved into the 43-room, 36,000-square-foot house in
1917. (Bourn was president and owner of Spring Valley Water Co. and
owner of the Empire Gold Mine at Grass Valley.) The residence
features carved interior moldings, marble fireplace facades, inlaid
parquet floors, French doors and a Spanish tile roof. Rooms on the
first floor have 17-foot ceilings, giving them a dramatic sense of
space and proportion.
</P>
<P>
   The name Filoli is derived from the first two letters of three
words (Fight, Love, Live) in a credo Bourn admired: FIght for a
just cause; LOve your fellow man; LIve a good life.
</P>
<P>
   Only main-floor rooms are open to the public _ including the
portico, foyer, reception room, transverse hall, kitchen, butler's
pantry, dining room, drawing room, library, stairway hall, study
and trophy room. They are furnished with 18th-century English
antiques.
</P>
<P>
   When you take your self-guided tour (maps are available as you
enter the house), don't miss the highlight _ the spectacular and
elegant 32-foot-wide, 70-foot-long ballroom. It's breathtaking,
with its oak parquet floor, French crystal chandeliers, massive
baroque marble fireplace and original ``watergreen'' paint walls
trimmed with gold leaf and decorated with murals painted in oil on
canvas. The scenes depict the Muckross House, the Abbey and
environs of the 11,000-acre estate Bourn bought for his daughter
and her husband in 1910 on the Lakes of Killarney in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   William P. and Lurline B. Roth bought Filoli _ including its
furnishings _ in 1937, a year after Agnes and William died. The
Roths lived there with their three children, during which time
Lurline, an avid horticulturist, preserved, renewed and enriched
the plantings and gardens without altering the original design.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Lurline generously deeded Filoli to the National Trust
for Historic Preservation and gave about $2 million to create an
endowment to perpetuate the property, noted Thomas Rogers, Filoli
Center curator of collections. Lurline moved out in 1975, promising
that the furniture would be returned upon her death. She died in
1986 at the age of 96, and some of the furniture was returned,
added Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   The house currently contains some original furniture along with
items on loan from the San Franciso Fine Arts Museums, according to
Rogers. However, the loan items are soon to be returned because of
a recent gift: During my visit at the end of May, Rogers and Filoli
volunteers were abuzz with excitement. Filoli had just inherited a
large collection of furnishings and porcelain from the late
Melville Martin, a Palos Verdes antique collector. The collection
will be incorporated into the house as quickly as possible, said
Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Allow a couple of hours for a leisurely stroll around the
grounds and house _ even more if you plan to eat (light lunches and
refreshments) in the Quail's Nest Cafe at the visitor and education
center near the parking area.
</P>
<P>
   After taking in the house, it's time to move into the gardens.
You'll want to spend plenty of time enjoying them; small surprises
await at every turn. On the glorious sunny Friday I visited, only
self-guided tours were feasible. However, if you visit on another
day of the week, docents guide visitors through the gardens,
highlighting the interesting plantings, designs and history.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens _ inspired by European influences _ are a succession
of separate areas containing ornamental patterns, lawns, a pool,
rose gardens and more. From different vantage points along the way,
you'll be afforded views of the garden, house, fields and hills.
This is a gardener's fantasy _ and paradise!
</P>
<P>
   Start at the sunken garden with its expansive view past hedges
and swimming pool to the hills beyond. As you enter, be sure to
look at the intricately carved gate from the San Francisco Bourn
house that separates this area from the Garden Shop.
</P>
<P>
   Then pass the Chartres and walled gardens (peruse them on your
return) and head for the rose garden, which was abloom with more
than 500 different varieties of roses in an array of fabulous
colors and names like Futura, Lilli Marlene, Europeana and Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   From there it's on to the Knot Garden, with its complicated and
interesting interwoven plantings, and the cutting garden, where
flowers are grown to use in arrangements in the house. Head to the
high place and look back at the house and expansive vistas.
</P>
<P>
   On the return walk beside yew allee (which was closed off during
my visit), you'll pass the orchard and daffodil field and once
again the rose garden before getting back to the walled garden,
entirely enclosed by a brick wall, with its quaint, beautiful
Garden House. Don't miss walking through this lovely marble-floored
single room with its wonderful floral arrangement made with garden
flowers. Italian Renaissance in style, it was designed by architect
Arthur Brown Jr., who also designed San Francisco City Hall and
Coit Tower. Brown also designed the garage (now the garden shop),
which is dominated by a clock tower.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the walled garden is a sundial inscribed,
``Time began in a garden.'' Walk over to the wedding place and
Dutch garden before heading out to the swimming pool and up some
stairs to view the tennis court nestled on a second tier in a
wooded area in what seemed like a couple of blocks from the house.
</P>
<P>
   Return to the area of the sunken garden and then walk by the
southwest and northwest terraces adjacent to the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Before exiting the gardens, stop by the garden shop for all
kinds of mementos and gifts with pretty floral designs.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling the manicured acres of gardens, the serenity and quiet
were overwhelming, as was the beauty of nature. Everywhere it was a
feast for the eyes and senses.
</P>
<P>
   According to curator Rogers, a full-time paid gardening staff of
15 is required for proper upkeep of the gardens. In addition, 100
volunteers also work in the garden. Filoli also has more than 1,000
active volunteers who assist with tours of the property,
hospitality and library tasks, staffing the garden shop and helping
out in the membership office. The extensive library specializes in
horticulture and garden design along with the decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   Discover Filoli on your next trip north. It's a little off the
beaten path, but worth the detour.

   CIR-WEB-FILTERS-NYT (Undated) _ The American Family Association,
a conservative Christian group, has strongly supported filtering
products, software meant to cordon off X-rated and other nasty
corners of the Internet from users, especially children. So it was
with some surprise that AFA officials discovered that their group's
own Web pages were being lumped together with skinhead, white
supremacist and other ``intolerant'' sites blocked by a popular
filter called Cyber Patrol. By Pamela Mendels. Moved 6-10. WITH

<P>
   CUBA-JEWS-ART-HNS (Havana) _ Before the 1959 revolution, some
15,000 Jews lived in Cuba. Thousands fled when Castro took over,
and those who remained faced the near-extinction of their faith and
culture. But in recent years there has been a growing renewal of
Cuba's small, impoverished Jewish community. That renaissance
continues, thanks in large measure to tireless assistance from
American Jews. By Cecile S. Holmes. Moved 6-9. WITH PHOTO.

   CANTORS-CONCERT-REVIEW-NYT (New York) _ To commemorate the 50th

turbulent times of his pontificate and the architect of
rapprochement with the communist world. By Alessandra Stanley.
Moved 6-9.
</P>
<P>
   ISLAM-BOMB-REVIEW-NYT (Washington) _ For more than two decades,
the prospect that a Muslim country could possess nuclear weapons
has often been summed up in two words _ ``Islamic bomb'' _ a phrase
that captured the imagination of some and terrified others. But is
there such a thing as a bomb that exists for the sake of Islam and
for the destruction of Israel? Or do the phrase and the oratory
about it reveal other things instead _ a hunger and rivalry for
greatness by major Islamic countries, and the depth of Israel's
anxieties? By Elaine Sciolino. Moved 6-6.

   BAPTISTS-NYT (Salt Lake City) _ The Southern Baptist Convention,
the nation's largest Protestant denomination and an increasingly

   BAPTISTS-C0NVERT-COX (Undated) _ The Southern Baptist blitz is
on in the home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Southern Baptists from across the nation, meeting for their
national convention in Salt Lake City, are taking part in an effort
to persuade Mormons to change their beliefs, to reach the

Southern Baptists who converted to Mormonism. By Kim Sue Lia
Perkes. Moved 6-8.

<P>
   BAPTISTS-MORMONS-NYT (Salt Lake City) _ Call it a confrontation

sports, business and government be similarly realized in organized
religion? Yes, replies Rodney Stark, a professor of sociology and
comparative religion at the University of Washington, who recently
published the results of a study making that case. Among Stark's

CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS GAIN INSPIRATION FROM SHAKERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``THE QUIET IN THE LAND: Everyday Life, Contemporary Art and the
Shakers''
</P>
<P>
   Organized by France Morin.
</P>
<P>
   At: Institute of Contemporary Art, through Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Shaker sect dwindles in numbers _ only seven members
remain in the last active community, in Sabbathday Lake, Maine _
Shaker influence in design and art increases. Most people, in fact,
know the Shakers only through those signature oval boxes and
rocking chairs that seem so in tune with contemporary minimalist
style. ``When I die,'' mused the late Sister R. Mildred Barker, ``I
fairly expect to be remembered as a piece of Shaker furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the strengths of the new show at the Institute of
Contemporary Art, ``The Quiet in the Land: Everyday Life,
Contemporary Art and the Shakers,'' is that it goes beyond the
furniture. The premise of the show is both simple and surprising.
Smitten by all things Shaker, New York-based independent curator
France Morin proposed a collaboration between the Sabbathday Lake
community and a group of contemporary artists. The Shakers
declined. Morin persisted and eventually prevailed. She invited 10
international artists to spend about a month at Sabbathday Lake in
the summer of 1996. Morin, the artists, and the Shakers lived,
worked, and worshiped together. The artists kept journals and drew
on them to make work they first exhibited at the Maine College of
Art in Portland last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Medvedow, the ICA's new director, saw the show in Portland
and went after it with as much determination as Morin had
displayed. One theme that attracted Medvedow was the stability of
the Shaker community vs. the mobility of modern life. Most of the
artists in the show, she notes, no longer live in the countries
where they were born. Some of the artists speak wistfully about the
Shakers' roots, but there was never any intention of Shakers
recruiting artists or vice versa. A respectful sharing was Morin's
idea.
</P>
<P>
   You might expect a certain superficiality in the show: A month
of living a vastly different life is mere toe in water. Morin knew
this and wisely chose artists who would avoid cliche and bring
their own experiences to the project rather than try to be
temporary Shakers. The success of this meeting of two groups who
are ostensibly as different as two groups could be is movingly
documented in a 45-minute video by Branka Bogdanov, the ICA's
senior video producer-curator, which should be your first stop at
the show. It reminds you that the Shakers broke down orthodoxy,
that they were _ and still are _ radicals, that equality of the
sexes was a tenet for them long before the feminist movement.
Artist Janine Antoni used this separate-but-equal status of Shaker
men and women as the basis for color photographs of the different
doors, staircases, and dining tables the men and women use, which
Antoni cropped and seamed to look like mirror images.
</P>
<P>
   When artist Domenico de Clario wanted to move a grand piano into
the Sabbathday Lake meetinghouse so he could play all through the
night of the summer solstice, the Shakers, after initial
hesitation, not only let him do it but sat through the performance
and later pronounced it powerfully beautiful. Bogdanov's video
shows how these unworldly people came to appreciate some of the
farthest shores of contemporary art because they came to it with
open minds and hearts. Sabbathday Lake Brother Wayne Smith
summarized it with Shaker economy: ``You do art, we do praying.''
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the improvised piano pieces de Clario made at
Sabbathday Lake wafts through the ICA. Contemplative and unhurried,
the music seems to slow the space down. Its phrases are short, some
questioning, some comforting. De Clario's work involves a ceding of
control: He made both the music and the monochromatic paintings in
the ICA show while ``blindfolded'' by a Shaker basket inverted over
his head. The results seem as connected to Zen, John Cage, and the
automatic writing of the Surrealists as to the Shaker faith.
</P>
<P>
   Antoni, too, got permission to use the meetinghouse, for the
kind of spinning dance that once was a part of the community's
rites. Holding a video camera, she spun until she fell to the
floor. The blurry, vertiginous result reads like an abstraction of
Doris Humphrey's 1930 dance ``The Shakers.''
</P>
<P>
   The fragmentation of de Clario's work is complemented by Sam
Samore's. He has outlined the ICA's zigzagging staircase with a
stream-of-consciousness text drawn in part from Shaker songs he
found in the Sabbathday Lake library. While the phrases are as
choppy as the staircase itself, they also pull the place together.
A line like ``making the anxiety sit still'' can stop you in your
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   This show somehow makes the ICA look even whiter than usual,
nowhere more so than in the mezzanine gallery where Adam Fuss's
silk and mylar ladders are affixed to the wall. They're silhouettes
without the contrasts, white on white, lit so they almost disappear
at the top. They start a couple of inches off the floor, which
gives them an otherworldly, gravity-free quality.
</P>
<P>
   Shakers seek the sublime in the everyday; so do many
contemporary artists. Jana Sterbak's search involved an ordinary
metal stool whose seat she replaced with a sponge cake. A
juxtaposition of two utilitarian objects, ``Cake Stool'' also
offers the show's only whiff of humor. Mona Hatoum took mundane
objects from a Shaker kitchen _ graters, colanders, strainers _ and
pressed them into ghostly white waxed paper. The regularity of the
resulting dots is contradicted by the intricate veining caused by
handling of the fragile surface. Hatoum's ``First Step'' is an
infant's crib that has left in its wake a powdered sugar stencil of
the diamond pattern of the crib's springs. It is literally
sweetness and innocence _ and makes you think of the Shakers'
celibacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese-born artist Kazumi Tanaka commemorates the silent
grace before Shaker meals in her installation ``Communion,'' a pair
of tables with shallow basins set in them. The basins are filled
with water on which the plainest of white dinner plates float. Food
would both sink and soil them: This is a meal of the mind. Between
the two tables stands a tall clock, ticking away the seconds, the
sound Tanaka remembers from the silent grace. The clock has no
face: It measures no time in particular. Tanaka's installation is
reminiscent of the 1996 show ``Kindred Spirits,'' a juxtaposition
of Shaker and Japanese arts. ``Kindred Spirits,'' which visited the
Art Complex Museum in Duxbury, demonstrated that the yearning for
the plain transcends geography.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Tillmans and Chen Zhen include images and artifacts
from non-Shaker cultures in their work. Tillmans's huge collage of
color photographs features skyscrapers, suburbs, train tracks, and
freeways, symbols of a frenetic contemporary life, along with
photographs of Sabbathday Lake, which looks removed from time. But
his most jarring inclusions are photos of Baroque churches whose
more-is-more aesthetic wars with Shaker modesty. Zhen made an altar
of Chinese wooden vessels, Asian counterparts to Shaker boxes,
along with a 10-sided Shaker chair, and wrapped both in an airy
framework of Chinese latticework windows. Zhen also made realist
portraits of all seven Shakers. On Bogdanov's video, Sister Frances
A. Carr reacts to hers, first with an ``I don't look like that!''
response, then by acknowledging that we don't see ourselves as
others do.
</P>
<P>
   Bogdanov's video also describes how artists and Shakers
collaborated on the restoration of an old fence, picket by picket.
Manual labor is, like love of the everyday, common to both. Manual
labor is much evident in Nari Ward's ``Threshold,'' which recycles
discards from Sabbathday Lake and a Baptist church in Harlem, where
Ward lives. Among the several elements in this muscular sculpture
are two Harlem preachers' pulpits, which face each other as Shaker
men and women face each other in the meetinghouse. The work is
surrounded by a burlap-wrapped fence from the porch of the
Sabbathday Lake Sisters' Shop. This fence, which was rotting, has
been replaced, and Ward smiles as he explains with what, because it
illustrates that Shakers are not trying to preserve some quaint
antique lifestyle. ``They wanted pressure-treated,'' Ward says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The first of the public events in conjunction with the ICA show
will be a lecture June 25 by Gerald C. Wertkin, director of the
Museum of American Folk Art in New York. He is to speak on the
history of the Shaker faith at 7:30 p.m. in the ICA theater. At 2
p.m. on June 26, Medvedow is scheduled to give a tour of the show.
And at 7:30 p.m. on July 16, Boston artist Michael Dowling is
slated to tell stories based on myth and spirituality, suitable for
all ages.

SOME JOBS REQUIRE A BIT MORE TASTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Carol Husfeld surveys the cart in front of her and
dips her spoon into a half-gallon tub of Peaches and Homemade
Vanilla ice cream. She nods her approval and then moves on to
sample a half-gallon of Homemade Vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Husfeld has what is perhaps the best job in the world _ she
spends her days tasting ice cream at Blue Bell Creameries in
Brenham, Texas. In the name of quality control, Husfeld is the
final check to assure that when a customer opens a carton of
chocolate ice cream, it's everything he is expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Folks such as Husfeld, who taste for a living, have golden
tongues. After years of experience, they know when the product
tastes good and when something is a bit off. Sometimes, Husfeld
said, production workers may have forgotten to add the peaches to
the Peaches and Homemade Vanilla or the nuts to the Buttered Pecan.
That careful attention to detail makes the difference between a
great product and a mediocre one.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes after the production line starts each day, Husfeld
tests the ice cream that rolls off the line. She samples everything
_ half-gallons, pints and novelties _ as well as all the raw
ingredients, such as fruit and nuts, and the syrups, such as
marshmallow and chocolate swirls for flavor, texture and color.
</P>
<P>
   Husfeld figures she eats about a half-gallon of ice cream each
day. Amazingly, after 10 years of professional eating, Husfeld is
thin. ``I used to weigh 50 pounds,'' she said modestly.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of the plant, the safety director, marketing
director, assistant production manager and the controller sit in
cubicles and at the signal _ it's very scientific _ the four men
put their spoons into bowls of Honey Cinnamon Graham Ice Cream.
</P>
<P>
   The research department developed the new flavor the previous
day and the four men, who sit on one of many tasting panels at the
plant, gave it a whirl at their monthly tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Safety director Howard Zuch complained that the cinnamon flavor
was too strong and the whole effect was too sweet. Zuch, an avid
ice cream eater whose favorite flavor is coffee, said he loves
serving on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Valera, research and development director, said the
testers are trained to look for key factors such as consistency _
but other than that, she wants tasters who just love ice cream and
are brutally honest.
</P>
<P>
   There is a dark side to tasting for a living, experts say. When
something is bad, you have to taste more of it, said Teresa
Byrne-Dodge, publisher and editor of My Table magazine, a
bi-monthly guide to dining out in Houston. Byrne-Dodge requires her
reviewers to visit a restaurant three times if the review is
negative. If the review is a good one, the reviewer only goes
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Tasting is a critical job in a company and it's common for the
chief executive to get in on the action _ especially if the food is
caviar and duckling.
</P>
<P>
   At Houston-based Continental Airlines, Chief Executive Officer
Gordon Bethune and President Greg Brenneman participate in the
tastings of the fine wines and the new dishes that are scheduled to
be served in business first on its international flights.
</P>
<P>
   For beer lovers, there probably isn't a sweeter sight than the
tasting room at the Anheuser-Busch Brewery in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the industrial plant is a richly paneled room with long
counters on three sides. Twice a day, the brewmaster and his
assistants gather to taste all the beer brewed that day along with
the waters that are used to rinse the bottles.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, about 75 glasses of beer were laid out
from end to end, and brewmaster Kirk Norris took a drink of every
third beer after swirling and sniffing it.
</P>
<P>
   Norris said he's looking for balance _ a full flavor that
shouldn't linger too long yet goes down easily. Swallowing is a key
part of the taste test, said Norris, who doesn't have the girth
most people would associate with a brewmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Tasters drink between one and two beers during a session. There
are about nine testers and they rotate so they don't have to taste
each day. It works out to about a six-pack a week, according to
Norris, who said he never tires of beer and often has one at home
with dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Norris and his assistants have gone through extensive training
to pick out imperfections that are typically caught early in the
brewing cycle. When a slight problem is spotted _ a bit too sweet
or harsh _ it's blended with another tank.
</P>
<P>
   If the job sounds good, don't get a college degree in beer
drinking. Study chemistry, food production and engineering because
you'll need to fix the problems when they come up, Norris said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 12 -- America's most influential female and
military leaders, including first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, paid
tribute this week to the late Sen. Margaret Chase Smith for her
legendary efforts in promoting women's positions in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton presented the first annual Margaret Chase Smith award
Thursday night to former Defense Secretary William Perry,
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Women's Armed Services
Integration Act.
</P>
<P>
   This act, which Smith wrote and was signed into law by President
Truman in 1948, established permanent professional status for women
in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have always been willing to do our part for our
country,'' Clinton said at a ceremony at the Women in Military
Service for America Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery. On
Friday, military leaders held panel discussions at the memorial
spotlighting women leaders in military, aerospace and medical
research.
</P>
<P>
   The Margaret Chase Smith Leadership Award was created by the
women's memorial foundation to honor leaders who follow in the
footsteps of the legendary Maine senator.
</P>
<P>
   Perry was recognized for his life-time dedication to promoting
meaningful roles for women in America's military, ``not because it
was the right thing to do,'' said Mrs. Clinton, ``but because it
was the smart thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The words `leadership' and `Margaret Chase Smith' naturally go
together. ... Senator Smith bolstered American national interests
and the active participation of women in all facets of American
life,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Both Collins and Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, were scheduled to
speak at the event but were detained with a vote in the Senate and
unable to attend.
</P>
<P>
   A second, ``surprise'' award was given to Major General Jeanne
M. Holm, who spent 33 years in the Armed Forces, rising from
private to two-star general.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Chase Smith was elected to the U.S. House of
Representatives in 1940 and the Senate in 1948, where she held a
seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, with oversight of the
military. She was the first woman in American history to be elected
to both Houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Smith was appointed a Lt. Colonel in the U.S. Air Force
Reserve where she served until 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 196,173 American women serving on active duty
in the armed forces, 8,400 of which are from Maine. Women make up
14 percent of the force.

KOHL DISCOVERS HE IS MORE GERMAN THAN EUROPEAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: News Analysis) 
 
By BERNARD D. KAPLAN 
c.1998 Hearst Newspapers 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has decided that being a
fervent supporter of European unity doesn't win many votes. So he
is pushing his credentials as a champion of his own country's
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl is trailing in the polls against Gerhard Schroeder, his
Social Democrat rival, in September's national elections. Opinion
surveys show that among his biggest handicaps is the perception
that he has given too much of his time to pushing European
integration and not enough to Germany's economic woes, including
record unemployment since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor's response has been to go on the attack against
the European Union's executive commission in Brussels, Belgium,
accusing it of highhandedness, and to denounce the idea of a
``centralized Europe'' in any form. He told his Christian
Democratic Union party congress last month that he would
``counterattack a new wave of bureaucracy by the European
institutions.``
</P>
<P>
   Kohl also began a campaign to slash Germany's contribution to
the European Union budget as ``excessive'' and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   At the next EU summit in July, he is expected to demand a large
cut in Germany's $11 billion contribution to the EU budget, the
largest of any of the 15 member nations. ``We want our money
back,'' Finance Minister Theo Waigel told a political meeting
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor's advisers reportedly regard the
budget-contribution issue as politically potent at a time when
average Germans are feeling the economic pinch more than they have
in years. A widespread popular view, as reflected in some German
newspapers, is that Germany is subsidizing other EU countries, even
those as wealthy as France and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl is suspected by some analysts of veering toward the more
nationalist stance of the Bavarian wing of his party, known as the
Christian Social Union, which has always been skeptical of moving
too fast toward European integration. Bavaria's vote is crucial if
he is to win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he and French President Jacques Chirac signed a joint
declaration calling for the safeguarding of national interests
within the EU.
</P>
<P>
   All this is strange talk coming from the man that his own
compatriots have dubbed ``Herr Europe.'' During the 16 years that
he has headed the Bonn government, he gained a reputation as
probably the most ardent champion of a united Europe. As recently
as two years ago, he declared that only the continent's integration
could ``solve the question of war or peace'' in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   His critics accuse Kohl of sheer cynicism in suddenly turning
into an opponent of developments he previously espoused because
German voters have shown clear signs of tiring of him and wanting a
new face at the head of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kohl is wrong to count on a show of anti-Europeanism to win
him re-election,'' according to analyst Lutz Kreeger, who writes
for Berlin's Morganpost newspaper. ``His supposed change of heart
comes far too late to get the votes of the real anti-Europeans and
strikes most other Germans as blatant opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kohl's real problem is that much of the country finds him worn
out and lacking in new ideas while it regards his aides as
incompetent,'' Kreeger said in a phone interview.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first time Hara Teicher ventured out to a
nightclub on Manhattan's Upper East Side, she met Jerry Steinberg.
No one wants to rush anything, but it appears to be love.
</P>
<P>
   That happy tale would not be so unusual, except for the ages of
the people involved. As romantic and social venues, nightclubs
these days are generally the province of 20-something hipsters
sporting tattoos and black miniskirts. But Ms. Teicher, a
therapist, is 43, while Dr. Steinberg, an internist from Israel, is
49.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-month-old club where they met, Decade, would never be
confused with Balthazar, Spy, Moomba or any of the other night
spots of the moment, where gatekeepers barely acknowledge a suit
with a comb-over or a skirt with, well, gray roots.
</P>
<P>
   With its elegant menu, wine cellar and late-'70s dance music
like ``Shame'' by Evelyn (Champagne) King and ``I Will Survive'' by
Gloria Gaynor pulsating from the sound system, Decade is geared to
baby boomers looking to meet the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``This relationship is a place I've been really looking to get
to for a long time,'' Ms. Teicher said. ``Before I heard about
Decade, I would never have gone to a club.''
</P>
<P>
   With growing ranks of people over 35 finding themselves single
in a social world not set up for them, a niche is arising for clubs
that cater to those with more years, more money and more
unapologetically discriminate taste.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that baby boomers _ the original inventors of the New
York singles scene back in the 1960s and '70s _ would seemingly
have outgrown meeting people at bars. Some, no doubt, have. But
plenty of others have been tempted back out again _ sometimes after
a divorce, sometimes after years of frustration with less
adventurous ways of meeting mates _ by nightclubs specially
designed to put them at ease.
</P>
<P>
   Decade is reminiscent of the Stork Club, where cocktails, dining
and dancing all came under one roof. Beneath a flattering amber
glow, patrons can enjoy a dinner of pan-seared salmon or braised
lamb shank in an upstairs dining room that overlooks the dance
floor. There is a private dining room in a 4,000-bottle wine
cellar, and a room with private humidors for regular customers, at
the top of the winding staircase.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've been in a 20-something singles bar, you know that's
no place for a grown-up,'' said Pepper Schwartz, a professor of
sociology at the University of Washington in Seattle. ``Quite
honestly, you wouldn't want to compete in visual attractiveness
with people in their 20s and 30s, who are arguably at the height of
good looks and good bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, besides Decade, on First Avenue, in the shadow
of the Queensboro Bridge, the over-35 crowd is hanging out at the
popular Rhythm Revue Dance Party at the Roseland Ballroom in
midtown, a giant monthly high school reunion of sorts that plays
'50s, '60s and '70s music for some 2,000 enthusiasts, who remember
the words from the first time around. The racially diverse,
sold-out crowd likes to get its groove on until the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, disk jockey Felix Hernandez _ spinning
songs like ``Mickey's Monkey'' by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles,
``Cold Sweat'' by James Brown, and ``Heatwave'' by Martha and the
Vandellas _ received raves from the crowd that was jolted back to
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   On the dance floor, crunchy granola met bargain basement chic as
the partygoers danced the night away, including those who were
emulating the look of Barry White and Chaka Khan. Some people even
dug out their '60s radical clothes, including a man in a dashiki,
who spent most of the evening cruising the periphery of the dance
floor, giving off vibes that were too powerful for the women.
</P>
<P>
   Those who prefer a more staid setting can nurse a glass of
champagne at a growing number of revolving singles parties at
private homes and upscale restaurants like Tavern on the Green and
Maxine's, said Marion Smith, a New York City party planner, who has
been in business for more than 20 years. In New York magazine, ads
for baby boomer dating parties have doubled to about 30 in the last
five years, Nancy Fedder, vice president of the magazine's
classifieds, said.
</P>
<P>
   Women are more likely to attend these kinds of soirees than men,
which makes sense: women over 38 are more likely to be single than
men in New York City. In 1996, the latest year for which figures
are available from the U.S. Census Bureau, almost 59 percent of the
single baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1961) in the city were
women, and just 41 percent men. That's partly because the mortality
rate of men in this age group is higher than for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows why women in this age group would be nervous about
their chances of getting married,'' said Andrew Beveridge, a
sociology professor at Queens College. ``And some of the men who
are left are likely to be gay, especially in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Brody considered this phenomenon when she conceived
Decade. ``I designed this place with women in mind. I know what
it's like to be a single, divorced mother,'' said Ms. Brody, who
has since remarried. ``I want women who come here to feel
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Through its music, Decade allows boomers to recapture the heady,
free-love days of the '60s and '70s that evolved into the ``disco
inferno'' nights of the '80s before the AIDS scare _ which
essentially erased the singles scene. Studio 54 died. Dinner became
the social thing to do in the '80s. Then after the stock market
crash in 1987, which marked the beginning of a recession, people
started to stay home and rent videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Studio 54,'' Ms. Brody said. ``I'm typical of that
era. I have created that environment for people to come with their
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   While a sexual undercurrent permeates the air, the over-35
patrons who frequent Decade are certainly more cautious about
dating than they were in their youth.
</P>
<P>
   Take Alan Stone, for example, a smartly dressed 51-year-old
businessman, who has been divorced for seven years and has two
grown children. He should know better than to try to meet Mrs.
Right at a bar, but he says Decade is different. It draws people
who are interested in long-term relationships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a Woodstock kid,'' he said. ``It was always bell-bottom
jeans and crazy shoes. I was down in the Village all spaced out.
But you grow up. You get more mature. You have your children. You
want a career. So, you tend to mellow out, not rush things.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Bell, 52, an investment banker and real estate
investor, who lives on the Upper East Side, is a regular at Decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decade has filled a void, created a niche for people 35 and
older on the Upper East Side,'' he said. ``By the time you reach
35, you are somewhat mature. Manners are somewhat expected. People
aren't necessarily shy about saying exactly what they're looking
for in a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Zarin, 51, a real estate investor and owner of Zarin
Fabrics in downtown Manhattan, who is separated, said supper clubs
like the Rainbow Room satisfy the refined tastes of some boomers,
but it plays big band, not disco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most clubs are like Life in the Village, which has a very
crowded dance floor,'' he said. ``They have VIP rooms for stars and
actresses, and you just sit back on a sofa and have drinks. At
Decade, you have food, plenty of people in my age bracket that now
have money to spend. This club is not dealing with kids who have no
money. You have the music of my generation in a nice atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Glynn, 43, a real estate broker from Staten Island, was at
Decade with three friends on a recent Saturday evening to celebrate
her sale of a $335,000 house on Todt Hill. She said the atmosphere
at Decade was female-friendly, meaning men who were looking for
dates were not sizing them up like morsels of meat.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glynn, who has been divorced for 12 years and has a
16-year-old daughter, said she planned to return to the club in the
hopes of meeting a mate. ``My friend met a man there six months
ago,'' she said. ``Now they're engaged. Why not come back? Where
else would I go?''

THIS WON'T BE YOUR STANDARD VIAGRA COLUMN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I take some pride in the fact that I seem to be the only
newspaper columnist between San Diego and Mattawamkeag, Maine, who
has not written what I would call my ``Viagra column.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't know, by the way, whether there IS a columnist in
Mattawamkeag, but I know columnist Margery Eliscu, who lives in
Poland, Maine, and I'm betting she's either been to or written
about Mattawamkeag. Besides, I didn't say ``in'' Mattawamkeag. I
said ``between'' San Diego and there. Sheesh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, I don't know whether Marge has written a Viagra column, but
I expect to see her this week in San Diego, and if you insist on
knowing, I'll ask her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was thinking about a Viagra column and Marge the other day
(they have no connection, so let it go) after I got my latest
newsletter from the National Society of Newspaper Columnists. I
read a line there from our group's treasurer, Roberta de Boer of
Toledo, who owes me money but promises to pay, so leave her alone,
too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roberta said no columnists should be allowed to attend our
upcoming 1998 convention ``until they first send their Viagra
column.'' Her assumption, of course, is that all columnists have
written a Viagra column. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The drug company Pfizer introduced its drug to combat male
impotency on tax-filing deadline day, April 15. (Speaking of that
inter-uh-mingling of events, what was up with that?) Since then
some story or comment about Viagra has been in most newspapers
almost every day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why? Well, the story has everything _ sex, money and happiness
(pronounced with an emphasis on the second syllable). You get a
story like that and columnists will flock to it like flies to the
Clinton administration. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But not me. It seems to me there are a few subjects on which I'm
not required to have an opinion. A good example: Not only have I
not done a Viagra column, but I have said nothing about Jerry
Seinfeld's final show, either. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, my reasons for avoiding both subjects were
similar. Neither is of any interest to me. I have never seen
Seinfeld's show and have neither personal nor professional interest
in male impotency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you end up writing about things you don't care about, readers
soon detect your emotional flatness and abandon you in favor of
something more exciting, like the obituaries or the list of grains
and soybeans prices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You have to be passionate about your topics. That's why, in the
past year or so, I have written about Alexander von Humboldt, the
National Assessment Governing Board, Wake Island, Fritz Zwicky,
cranberry-vodka punch, house-sized ice comets, C-SPAN, Helen Herron
Taft, the ``Vermont Weather Calendar,'' the Cornish-Windsor Covered
Bridge, WIN buttons and Antiphanes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because I think columnists have to care _ and care deeply _ I
have just this year tackled these hot-button subjects: Miguel de
Cervantes, Calvin Coolidge, the Manuscript Division of the Library
of Congress, Canadian wheat, Vesto Slipher, Aesop and National Car
Care Month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clearly these engaging topics, which actually matter to most of
our lives, are more worthy of my (and your) limited time and space
than Jerry Seinfeld and Viagra. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I do not, by the way, wish to imply anything about Seinfeld by
tossing him into the same sentence with Viagra. I don't know Jerry
Seinfeld. I already have told you I've never watched his
now-defunct show. And whether he takes Viagra is of even less
interest to me than the fact that Pfizer chose the name Viagra to
suggest virility and vigor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And even that's a fact about which I simply don't care. Which is
why I'm not going to write a Viagra column. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, unless I need one to get into the columnists' convention. &QL;
</P>
<P>

FATHER'S DAY GREW BECAUSE OF ONE SMART GUY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1997 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Father's Day approaches each year, I become grateful that my
children may remember me but a little annoyed that children
everywhere will feel a sense of oppressive, culturally contrived
obligation about all of this because of one Sonora Smart Dodd. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet how could anyone harbor ill feelings toward someone with
so sonorous a name as Sonora Smart Dodd? It seems to fill the air
with clear, lilting music. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sonora, it turns out, was sitting in church on Mother's Day of
1909 in Spokane, Wash., listening to a sermon in praise of
motherhood. (Isn't it reassuring to learn that even back then many
preachers apparently were courageous enough to risk praising
motherhood on Mother's Day?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sonora, that day, could not have known that later that same year
my own father would be born, but she did know that her father, one
Henry J. Smart, was a pretty good guy, having reared his daughter
by himself after Sonora's mother suffered an untimely demise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sonora's gratefulness led her to suggest that there should be a
day to honor fathers as well as mothers. (See? You probably thought
a man dreamed up Father's Day _ perhaps even a man in need of some
new ties.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sonora obviously knew how to get things done. Indeed, the very
next year the mayor of Spokane proclaimed June 19 Father's Day.
Before long the idea spread and in 1924 President Calvin Coolidge
declared his support of the concept. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (By the way, it recently occurred to me what Silent Cal Coolidge
looks like in most of his photos. Do you know what a screen saver
on a computer is? It's a program that makes your screen go
essentially blank when it's left unattended. The computer is on,
but, aside from some randomly blinking lights, it looks like no one
is home. Coolidge looked as if he had a screen saver running on his
face most of the time. Kind of like Al Gore today.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it took until 1972 for Congress _ usually quick to rush
into such easy pickings _ to pass a law recognizing the third
Sunday in June as a day to honor Dad. By then, as surely you know,
Richard Nixon was president. There were days when the shadowy Nixon
could have used a screen saver running on his foreboding face. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am, if you insist on knowing, both a father and a step-father.
(One difference between them is that to achieve the former office
one usually wears fewer clothes.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And as I've already indicated, I had a father, too. He lived 82
years, most of it in Illinois, without ever seeing the Chicago Cubs
win a World Series. In turn, I have lived 53 years without seeing
that happen. What a life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Dad was alive, I recall feeling a forced sense of duty
whenever Father's Day rolled around. I knew I would be expected to
come up with some sort of clever gift and card, and each year it
seemed as if the list of things he would either need or appreciate
got smaller and smaller. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure my children feel the same way now, though I do my best
to leave hints for them about the denomination of currency I would
find most useful. This helpfulness on my part, I figure, saves them
from wasting time searching for just the right screen saver or
something for me. Well, not for me but for my computer. My stare is
blank enough without adding new software. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When my children were younger, I was ambivalent about receiving
Father's Day gifts from them because I knew that most of the money
they spent could be traced back to my pocket. But I've recovered
from that. Besides, my collection doesn't yet include the Sonora
Smart Dodd Beanie Baby. &QL;

 By ELIZABETH HAYT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After putting the finishing touches on a recent
makeover of my bathroom, I stepped back and marveled at the
spanking white tiles, sparkling fixtures and plush, cream-colored
towels. Suddenly, the sight of a bar of pink Dove in my new
porcelain soap dish jarred me. The supermarket staple was
dreadfully out of place in my new sanctum of personal hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   I rushed to L'Occitane on Madison Avenue at 80th Street, a
luxury outpost of a venerable French soap maker, whose
manufacturing processes originate in Provence. Browsing among 15
soaps in 60 scents, I picked Linden Wood, a blond, oval-shaped bar
that looked like a smooth beach stone. Its subtle, woodsy fragrance
was seductive. It hardly mattered that it cost $7, more than twice
the price of a Dove twin-pack.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time I had splurged on luxury soap for myself,
but it would not be the last. At the cash register, announcing my
embarrassment at paying so much _ money that would literally go
down the drain _ Terris Krueger, the store manager, told me,
``You'll get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to use Dial,'' he said. ``But three years ago when I
worked at the bed and bath shop at Takashimaya, I got some samples
from the vendors. I was amazed how my skin felt and smelled. I'm a
soap snob now. I guarantee you'll become one, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned out to be right. Ever since, I have been a convert to
luxury soaps _ to linden tree extract and African shea butter, to
triple-milling and palm oil, all the persnickety hallmarks of
premium soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all sorts of evaluation processes as to what makes
soap appeal to a soap snob,'' said Robert Cantor, a clothing
importer who is a longtime devotee of designer suds. His obsession
dates from the 1970s, when he discovered Erno Lazlo soap, and
continues today with Floris, Pears and Issey Miyake, rotating the
bars each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask myself, Does the soap feel good in my hand?'' Cantor
said. ``Does it feel good rolling in a washcloth or on my skin?
Does my skin feel fresh afterward, or does the soap cling to my
skin? You also have to know the water in the area you live in,
because if it's soft, you need less soap. If it's hard, you need a
lot of soap to generate suds. You may feel you need a stronger soap
in the winter, and in the spring, you need something light and
floral.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiminy, so many subtleties for those who dedicate themselves to
soap connoisseurship. But Cantor is hardly alone. As the
proliferation of luxury bath boutiques indicates, soap snobbery is
on the rise. The L'Occitane chain, originally from Europe, landed
in Manhattan two years ago, has added two other New York locations
and plans to open shops this summer in New Jersey, Connecticut and
Washington, D.C. Portico Bed and Bath opened its first store in
SoHo in 1992, selling an egg-size soap for $2.50 and a ``toning''
soap for $21 _ and has since expanded to nine stores in the New
York region.
</P>
<P>
   Soap snobbery has even trickled down to the mass market. Since
1990, the Bath and Body Works chain, which is owned by Intimate
Brands, the same company that controls Victoria's Secret, has grown
to 900 stores, many in malls. Its fruit-scented liquid and bar
soaps, from $2.50 to $8.50, are booming, accounting for $210
million in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even Wal-Mart is in a lather over fancy soaps. Although it
sounds like an oxymoron, the discount chain has introduced a
``luxury'' bath line, the Regatta Clothing Company Bath and Body
Collection, which includes scented soaps enriched with natural
luffa extracts that sell for $1.50 each. (Luxury is clearly
relative _ $1.50 qualifies because Wal-Mart sells Ivory three-packs
for 97 cents.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Portico stores there are body washes, body balsams, body
shampoos, bath salts, bath oils and basic bath bars. There are also
exfoliating, energizing and stress-reducing soaps. Some are made
with tea, milk, honey or oatmeal, all ingredients for a healthy
breakfast. Other soaps are perfumed with garden flowers, ocean
waters or alpine forests. Once the soap foams, releasing its
fragrance, the cleanser acts like a magic carpet, transporting you
mentally to the natural wonder of your choice.
</P>
<P>
   Recreating natural wonders is often a soap maker's inspiration.
``I had a background in geology, and one day I was in the shower
and there were soap remains that looked like little pebbles,'' said
Tod Pink of Oneonta, N.Y., recalling the moment when he conceived
of Soaprocks. They are soaps that resemble the faceted shapes and
colors of quartz crystals, minerals and semiprecious stones.
Fellismo sells them for $13.50 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   These days, soaps that emphasize ``all natural'' ingredients _
meaning they are not based on traditional tallow, or animal fat _
often command premium prices, thanks to the craze for healthy
living and the corollary that non-animal products are somehow
better suited to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better soaps are 100 percent vegetable,'' Krueger, the
L'Occitane manager, maintained, adding that soaps based on olive or
palm oils are less dehydrating.
</P>
<P>
   L'Occitane also uses the Marseilles process of triple-milling, a
traditional technique whereby the soap is pressed three times to
eliminate any air. The company says this produces a harder bar than
more commercial varieties, one that lathers better, lasts longer
and is more moisturizing.
</P>
<P>
   Not all experts in saponification _ the science of soap making _
agree. ``A Marseilles bar is like any regular soap, but it has
higher moisture and glycerin and ingredients that improve the
feeling of the soap on the skin,'' said Armando San Juan, director
of technology at Colgate-Palmolive, the maker of Palmolive and
Irish Spring soaps. ``A lot of special ingredients are put in for
marketing purposes,'' he added. ``But it's really a regular
palm-coconut oil soap with glycerin, preservatives and little
goodies. The way it is described makes it seem special. And they're
able to sell it at a higher price.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, consumers seem to know no bounds in their taste for
luxuries, especially if the luxuries are low-key ones like fancy
soap. In March, when Bergdorf Goodman introduced sandalwood soaps
by Jo Malone of London at $40 for three bars, it nearly sold out in
two weeks. And Takashimaya regularly sells out a $35 Vellutina, or
velvet soap, from Florence.
</P>
<P>
   For the truly indulgent, those who cannot get enough of
specialty soaps, there is L'Occitane's Eco Museum of Soaps in Volx,
a village in Provence. There, cleanser zealots can witness the
miracle of soap making and ogle antique bars displayed like
reliquary objects. The pilgrimage, which approximately 80,000 have
made since 1992, takes a bubbling desire to be immersed in the
realm of rarefied suds.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 216.
WASHINGTON, June 12 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments this week.
A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the
member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not
vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: DRUG
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Tuesday, 52-46, to approve an amendment to the
tobacco settlement bill. The measure would set aside $3 billion per
year to boost the nation's drug interdiction efforts and encourage
the states' schools and businesses to crack down on drug users.
Supporters said the bill should do more than just go after
tobacco-related problems. Opponents said the amendment might help
drug fighting efforts but hurt efforts to stop teen smoking, the
``real gateway'' to drugs. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
(Vote no. 151)

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: BUDGET
</P>
<P>
   The House on Friday passed, 216-204, a 1999 budget plan that
would cut domestic spending and provide $101 billion in tax relief
over five years for married couples. Supporters said the bill would
provide needed tax relief. Opponents said that it violated last
year's balanced budget agreement and that it would cut funding for
education, the environment and health care. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill. (Vote no. 210)
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: RUSSIA
</P>
<P>
   The House voted Tuesday, 392-22 to implement legislation geared
toward forcing Russia to stop exporting missile technology to Iran.
The legislation will impose sanctions on Russian companies that
have a history of helping Iran develop missiles. Both the House and
Senate passed the bill and President Clinton is expected to veto
it. Supporters said the legislation challenges the Russians to stop
trading with rogue countries. Opponents said sanctions could
backfire by discouraging Russia's cooperation. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill. (Roll no. 211)
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: BANKRUPT
</P>
<P>
   The House voted Wednesday, 306-118, to reform the nation's
bankruptcy laws. The measure would make it harder for debtors to
escape payment of debts through declaring bankruptcy. Supporters
say that the bill will hold debtors accountable for paying as much
of their debt as possible. Opponents say that the bill puts too
many restrictions on bankruptcy filers. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill. (Roll no. 225)

GARDENING: A SUMMER VINE YIELDS A SWEET REWARD IN FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 14)  
 (bl)  
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I lived in an apartment with a balcony, friends used to
admire the vine I had growing there each summer in an old apple
crate. Its shiny leaves cascaded over the balcony's edge, and it
always looked fresh, healthy and a little bit tropical.
</P>
<P>
   What I liked best about that vine was that after the first frost
had blackened its foliage, I would dump it out of the crate and
harvest a nice crop of sweet potatoes from its roots.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet potato vines are pretty. They even make decorative
houseplants, which are easily grown by putting a whole sweet potato
into a vase half-filled with water, so that the top of the potato
is high and dry. It will sprout within a couple of days. Eventually
the potato will rot, at which point you discard the plant and start
a new one.
</P>
<P>
   But the vines are best in the garden, because that is where they
will produce an abundance of sweet potatoes, erroneously thought of
by some people as yams.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet potatoes are Ipomoea batatas, a relative of the morning
glory. Yams are in the genus Dioscorea and are an important food
source in the tropics but are seldom grown in the United States.
The confusion is compounded by the fact that canned sweet potatoes
are usually labeled ``yams.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two main types of sweet potatoes. The most commonly
available type has moist, orange flesh; the other has drier, mealy
flesh that is usually off-white or yellowish.
</P>
<P>
   Where I live, in south-central Pennsylvania, most local
gardeners prefer the dry, white sweet potato, which they call sweet
potato. The orange one they call yam. Both, however, are sweet
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet potatoes are generally thought of as a Southern vegetable.
About 60 percent of the commercial crop comes from North Carolina
and Louisiana. But they can be grown successfully in the North,
provided that the growing season is at least 120 days long.
</P>
<P>
   Most modern varieties mature in just 90 days, but sweet potatoes
do not grow well in the cool soil of early spring, even if frost
danger is past. Although my last average frost date is May 10, I
don't plant sweet potatoes until late May, sometimes as late as
mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are grown from slips, which are rooted sprouts from a
sweet potato. Slips are available by mail order or in garden
centers, or you can produce your own by burying a sweet potato in a
pot of soil and keeping it in a warm spot. Each potato will produce
from eight to 12 rooted sprouts in about three weeks. When they are
roughly 6 inches tall, detach them carefully from the surface of
the mother potato's skin, keeping as many roots attached as
possible. If you like, that mother potato can then produce another
crop of slips.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet potatoes won't appreciate your finest garden soil, so
don't waste it on them. Poor, dry, slightly acidic soil suits them
fine, and I never add fertilizer to the sweet potato bed. If grown
in fertile loam, the potatoes may develop skin lesions similar to
the scab disease that afflicts white potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Raised beds are good for sweet potatoes, because the mounded
soil will warm up faster in the spring and drain quickly after a
heavy rain. If possible, use black plastic mulch on the sweet
potato bed. Not only will this help warm the soil, but it will also
prevent the vines from sending down additional roots as they sprawl
across the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Letting the vines root along their length will greatly reduce
the harvest. If you don't use plastic, you will need to lift the
vines off the ground every week or so to keep them from rooting.
</P>
<P>
   Plant the slips from 12 to 18 inches apart, and if you're
growing a standard variety, allow at least three feet for the vines
to sprawl. (I like the red-skinned standard varieties Georgia Jet,
which produces large, round potatoes, and Beauregard, which
produces more elongated potatoes.) If space is at a premium, grow a
bush variety like Vineless Porto Rico or Vardaman, which send out
vines only 18 inches long, about half the length of a standard
vine.
</P>
<P>
   All these varieties are orange-fleshed. Finding slips of
white-fleshed sweet potatoes is difficult. The best course might be
to buy a white sweet potato at a specialty store or farmers' market
and to grow your own slips.
</P>
<P>
   If planted in plastic mulch, sweet potatoes require virtually no
further attention until harvest time. When the first frost has
nipped the foliage (or before, if you just can't wait to sample the
crop), cut off the vines and dig up the potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   This is best done cautiously, with a garden fork, starting a
foot or more away from the main stem. If you accidentally spear a
potato, put it on the dinner menu within a few days. It will not
keep for long.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet potatoes need to be cured for long storage. Brush off
loose soil, but don't wash the potatoes. Spread them out in a warm,
dry area for at least a couple of weeks. A curing temperature of 80
to 85 degrees is ideal, which for many gardeners is right next to
the furnace.
</P>
<P>
   Once cured, sweet potatoes will keep for months in a cool, dry
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Save two or three of the best potatoes to provide slips for next
year's garden. If your garden can't hold that many sweet potato
plants, there's always the option of lining up apple crates on the
balcony or patio. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ As hemlines flutter below the knee this spring, the
stock market may not be falling with them, despite Wall Street
lore, but another leading indicator associated with plunging
hemlines has taken effect: the return of hats.
</P>
<P>
   Hat departments of big stores and small boutiques are full of
customers, since nothing complements the silhouette of a flowing
calf-length skirt or dress like a charming chapeau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time skirts get longer, hats go crazy,'' said Judy
Collinson, the general merchandise manager for women's
ready-to-wear and accessories at Barneys New York. ``It really
works. Long skirts make for a really good hat season.''

   At Barneys, Andrew Wilke's $175 wide-brimmed ivory-colored sun
hats, reminiscent of English gardening hats, are perfect for
frizzy-hair days. The crowns are cool linen fabrics in pastel
shades, including blue and gray, reminiscent of men's oxford
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   For $325, Nafi di Luca's flights of fancy include an iridescent
organza-covered pink straw sun hat adorned with straw strips _ a
kind of upscale scarecrow look, more suited to the Connecticut
countryside than Iowa cornfields.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Treacy, one of the most original modern milliners, offers
fashionable hats that are not overtly fussy at Bergdorf Goodman.
His Mad Hatter style in fuchsia-colored straw has a brim covered
with wisps of straw woven into a scallop shell pattern. It is $359.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Bergdorf's are Lola's imaginative and whimsical
concoctions, including a pagoda-style hat in natural straw dotted
with black raffia daisies, for $265. ``It's inspired by '50s
chinoiserie with Bermuda souvenir decoration,'' said the designer,
who uses only her first name. ``That's a great beach look.''
</P>
<P>
   British milliner Patricia Underwood created the Isabella this
season, a picture hat with a wide, flexible brim that can be turned
up or down. It is $415 at Bergdorf's. Made of tightly woven straw
with a slight sheen, the hat comes in colors to match eye shadows
like violet, lilac and pistachio. The brim is broad enough to
protect against the sun and adds a romantic touch to a summer
frock.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hat must set off your silhouette,'' Ms. Underwood said,
giving tips on how to choose one. ``The whole thing has to work in
terms of proportion. It helps if you are wearing the outfit you
will be wearing with the hat, or you should have a vision of how it
will look in total. You put a lot of thought into the height of
your heel and cut of the shoe. The hat has to marry with that. The
color of the hat should be flattering to the eyes. The other thing
that is important is the neckline. If you show more neck, you can
wear more brim.''
</P>
<P>
   To look as if you've just stepped out of an Impressionist
painting, there are classic boaters trimmed in colored grosgrain
bands and bows ranging from $300 to $375 at Tracey Tooker,
Lexington Avenue and 82nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   And if the South Pacific is more your style than the Seine, the
Hat Shop, at 120 Thompson Street (Prince Street), has black or
natural hats by Sheenan Huxham inspired by the roofs of beach huts
in the tropics. Shaped like Dior's classic upside-down dish hat,
they are edged with raffia fringe and cost $220. All you need is a
pair of Capri pants to complete the castaway look.

EVERY LITERATURE HAS ITS SIGN, OR DEAD MULE, IN THE SOUTH'S CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They die from asphyxiation, rabies, drowning and falling off
cliffs. They are hit by trains, worked to death, hanged, stabbed,
shot and, in one Cormac McCarthy novel, decapitated by an irate
opera singer.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the fate of the mules of the South as recounted in a
minor classic of mock scholarship entitled ``Equine Gothic: The
Dead Mule as Generic Signifier in Southern Literature in the 20th
Century.''
</P>
<P>
   It asked a simple question, ``What makes Southern literature
Southern?'' and came up with a simpler answer. You can tell it's
Southern if it has a dead mule in it.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, written by Jerry Leath Mills, a retired Renaissance
scholar at the University of North Carolina, and published a year
ago in The Southern Literary Journal, is a parody of both academic
literature and obsessive scholarship. But beyond its own question
and answer, it presented an intriguing thought for reflection: If
the dead mule is the signifier for Southern literature, what is the
element that makes French literature French or Irish literature
Irish or film noir noir?
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who began collecting dead mule references when he was a
graduate student at Harvard in 1964, unearthed more than 200
examples of Equus caballus x asinus (defunctus), as he refers to
them, in Southern literature. His citations include William
Faulkner, Richard Wright, Erskine Caldwell, Truman Capote, Thomas
Wolfe and Zora Neale Hurston _ including Doris Betts' seminal ``The
Dead Mule'' _ to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   They are all arranged ``coroner-wise'' by cause of death, and
McCarthy, who killed off 59 specific mules in ``Blood Meridien''
alone, emerges as the king of Southern letters, mulewise at least,
even though he's best known for his novels about West Texas and the
border.
</P>
<P>
   The search for other signifiers in a completely unscientific
survey of professors and literary types wasn't quite so simple,
often descending to snippy lectures on what constitutes a genre (a
big topic in its own right) and the depravity of cultural
oversimplification. But since the generic signifier for academic
literature is inscrutable terms like ``generic signifier,'' maybe
that's not surprising. Still, more than a few worthwhile
contributions turned up.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Pinsker, an English professor and expert in Jewish
American literature at Franklin and Marshall College had a
similarly pithy signifier for modern Jewish novels _ ``Portnoy's
Complaint'' being the ultimate example _ with their persistent
concern about intermarriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signifier isn't a dead mule,'' he said. ``It's a live,
blond shiksa.'' (For those unfamiliar with the technical term
``shiksa,'' it describes a non-Jewish woman.)
</P>
<P>
   Jack O'Connell, a novelist who edits the alumni magazine and
teaches expository writing at the College of the Holy Cross in
Worcester, Mass., is a serial signifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It it's got a sweating amnesiac in a predatory city, it's film
noir,'' he said. ``If it's got adultery with a chamber maid in a
haze of Gitanes smoke, it's French lit, and if it's got mother
love, xenophobic ballads and cirrhosis, it's Irish lit.''
</P>
<P>
   Most signifiers _ even the dead mule _ are open to debate. But
some cases are pretty strong. Sam Coale, an English professor at
Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., and a Hawthorne scholar, said the
presence of a minister in heat was essential for a New England
novel. Lisa Hoagland, an English professor at the University of
Cincinnati, said you could not have popular feminist fiction in the
1970s without a divorce.

MYTHS OF THE SIXTIES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the wallet-size version of the sixties:
</P>
<P>
   Before, there were the fifties, a placid decade of consensus,
when Americans watched ``Father Knows Best,'' pursued the same
grassy suburban dreams and shared the same values.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was a volcanic rupture, a cultural big bang that
severed the era from the past. Student rebels, civil rights
marchers and antiwar protesters challenged the authority of the
family, the police, the military, the government and the
university. The New Left eventually fell apart, but set the stage
for a rights revolution that extended to women and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Neither liberals nor conservatives dispute the basic
before-and-after storyline. Both concur it blasted away the
existing order and led to undreamed-of personal license. What they
can't agree on is whether this represented a fulfillment of
American values or their betrayal, a disaster or a deliverance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, historians are beginning to veer clear of the
familiar good-sixties, bad-sixties debate as if it were a
bumper-to-bumper feud over a single parking spot. Instead, they are
challenging the traditional before-and-after narrative, arguing
that the sixties do not represent as cataclysmic a break as
portrayed or as exceptional a decade as the proliferation of
college courses on the period would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Pivotal developments like the civil rights movement, urban
decline and consumerism began years earlier, they say. Meanwhile,
other crucial developments _ the religious revival, for instance,
or the change in immigration patterns _ have unappreciated links to
the sixties. Scholars are finally exploring just how much things
changed and how much they stayed the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's my livelihood, I make an argument against
sixties exceptionalism,'' says Thomas Sugrue, who has taught a
course on the sixties for seven years at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``It was a moment when many of the conflicts burst
into the surface, but we misread other decades if we focus on the
sixties as this moment of rupture or apocalypse.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much did change in the sixties : Hair was longer, sex
was freer, protests were larger, soldiers were dying in Vietnam.
Yet both left- and right-wing partisans have a motive to exaggerate
the degree of radical change _ either to score ideological points
or to justify or atone for their pasts. Bickering over the culture
wars has in general helped drown out interpretations that emphasize
links with the previous decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has his or her own sixties, and it means a lot to
them,'' says Allen Matusow, author of ``The Unraveling of America:
A History of Liberalism in the Sixties.'' ``The reason the sixties
still evoke such vehement reactions is because we're still fighting
over what kind of a country and what kind of a culture we're going
to have. But do people have a full understanding of what
happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Sugrue has probably gone the furthest in trying to replace the
before-and-after narrative with the-same-only-more-so. ``I believe
that in my lifetime there will no longer be courses on the
sixties,'' he said. ``We'll teach the whole postwar period as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he points to the series of race riots that
convulsed cities across America in the sixties, arguing that the
ruinous decline of booming industrial cities was the product not of
sixties racial violence, white flight and backlash, as some have
argued, but rather of housing patterns, job discrimination and the
deindustrialization that occurred in the forties and fifties.
</P>
<P>
   The New Deal created a ``newfound sense of entitlement'' for all
Americans, while wartime military service lodged the expectation of
equal treatment in the minds of African-Americans, he writes in
``The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar
Detroit,'' (Princeton, 1998). Yet during the late forties and
fifties, discrimination kept blacks in the lowest paying jobs and
the worst neighborhoods. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of
entry-level manufacturing jobs disappeared in the Midwest and
Northeast. (In 1957, one in five black Americans was unemployed.)
Detroit may not have burned until 1967, but Sugrue points out that
a decade earlier, unemployed blacks warned of ``widespread riots''
if confronted with another depression.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Tischler, who edited the series ``Perspectives on the
Sixties,'' wouldn't go quite as far as Sugrue. Still, she notes,
``I try not to say that the sixties are so different from any other
time. There are many periods of dramatic political and social
change. Is it more important than the period 1935 to 1945? I'm not
sure I can make that case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tischler, who has taught courses on the sixties at both
Barnard College and Columbia University, starts her students off
with the notion that President John F. Kennedy continued the Cold
War policies of the Eisenhower administration. If the United States
was going to strut the superiority of capitalist democracies over
Communist regimes around the world, then it was going to have to
prove it at home. ``That's why civil rights could become an
important issue in terms of the Cold War,'' she said: it was used
as part of ``the arsenal'' against Communism, as was the war on
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would really focus on continuity, particularly in the period
up to about 1968,'' she says. ``There was tremendous faith in the
ability of people to change their own system.'' Peaceful protesters
were drawing on traditions of American thought as old as the
Revolution. They ``took Locke and Jefferson very seriously,'' she
said.

`GOOD QUESTION': YOU'RE ON THE AIR, SMARTY-PANTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are not many places where you can win a gift
set of Torah cards or a teeth cleaning just for knowing a few
things about Benjamin Franklin. ``Good Question,'' a new call-in
radio quiz program on historical figures, is just such a place.
</P>
<P>
   Created by WMCA (570 AM) and broadcast from 8 to 9 on Saturday
nights, the program is one of the few listener-call-in game shows
in New York City. On ``Good Question,'' the 37-year-old creator,
producer and writer Philip Suraci, under the name Cuthbert Powell,
announces biographical information about the figure of the week,
which sets up but usually has little to do with the questions that
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Was Benjamin Franklin's father a butcher, a baker or a
candlestick maker? Sura, a teacher from Brooklyn's Crown Heights,
wins a camera for her answer: candlestick maker.
</P>
<P>
   Some questions are a little off the subject, which opens the way
for specialists on other topics. What is the meaning of the name
Philip (of Macedon), father of Alexander the Great? ``Lover of
birds?'' ventures Yhoeved, a researcher from Manhattan. ``Word
up!'' says host Ritch Duncan, 25, a stand-up comic who has
performed his routine about having parents who pride themselves on
being liberals (``They're disappointed that I'm not gay,'' he says)
at Gotham, Rebar and the Monkey's Paw in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher hangs up happy, with a gift set of Torah cards
for her efforts. Other prizes, all from sponsors, include cameras,
film tickets, pizza, massages and those teeth cleanings.
</P>
<P>
   On another evening, Ruchel from the Kensington section of
Brooklyn is asked which car Leonardo da Vinci would buy if he were
in the market for an Italian model: Fiat, Volvo or Linda
Evangelista. She picks No. 3. Sorry, Ruchel. The answer is Fiat.
But Leo, a retired archivist from Manhattan, scores when he is
asked whether Walt Whitman served as a nurse during the Civil War.
(He did.) ``Torah cards!'' Leo shouts.
</P>
<P>
   Goldie, a 10-year-old from Crown Heights, is asked by Duncan if
she has read any poems by Whitman. ``No,'' she confesses. He
reassures her, ``I think you're going to do well.'' (But she
doesn't: Whitman was an editor for The Daily Eagle in Brooklyn, not
The Brooklyn Herald or The Alaminer Journal.)
</P>
<P>
   By turns educational and cheesy, ``Good Question'' is introduced
each week as ``the answer to all your problems'' as well as ``one
day America's most-listened-to talk show.''
</P>
<P>
   While audience figures for ``Good Question,'' which began in
mid-December, are not yet available, WMCA _ former home of the Good
Guys Top 40 team of the 1960s _ is heard by 21,100 people from 7
p.m. to midnight on Saturdays, according to Arbitron, the radio
ratings service.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers can also listen to WNYC (820 AM) to hear ``Whad' Ya
Know?,'' a quiz, comedy and interview show produced in Madison,
Wis., and broadcast on Saturday afternoons from 1 to 3 and replayed
at 2 a.m., and ``Says You!,'' a wordplay game show based in Boston
that is broadcast on Saturday nights from 7 to 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Question'' has recently been picked up by WAXY (790 AM),
a station in Miami that reaches the Caribbean. A Web site
(www.netreaction.com/goodquestion) has been set up with news on the
program: George Washington will be the topic next Saturday. The
show's phone number is (201) 460-WMCA; it is broadcast from
Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   WMCA is owned by Salem Communications of Camarillo, Calif., a
Christian broadcasting company; Talkline Communications Network,
based in New York, buys 10 hours of programming on Saturday nights
for Jewish-oriented shows. Suraci presented ``Good Question'' to
Talkline, which wanted a secular program to offer after Shabbat,
which is from sundown Friday to nightfall Saturday, when many
observant Jews do not drive or turn on electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian programs on WMCA include ``Focus on the Family
With James Dobson'' (weekdays at 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.) and ``The
Bible Answer Man'' (weekdays at 6 p.m.); the Jewish programs
include ``The Top 10 Jewish Music Countdown'' (Sundays at 4 a.m.)
and ``Talkline With Zev Brenner'' (Saturdays at 11:30 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   ``So read up,'' Duncan tells his listeners about the program on
Napoleon. ``It's always a short show when you talk about
Napoleon.'' Janet from Manhattan, who with her Midwestern accent is
among the few callers clearly not a native of New York City or
Eastern Europe, proves to be a comedian herself.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Napoleon owed his leadership capabilities to his
mother, his father or Morey Amsterdam, Janet goes for Mom. ``Do I
win the Beatles tickets?'' she asks breathlessly. ``They're playing
at Shea! I read about it in The World-Telegram.'' Janet settles for
a massage.

NOHO ARTS DISTRICT READY TO PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forty-eight hours from now, when the jugglers and
the jazz musicians have gone home, and the chorizo-on-a-stick
stands have packed up for another year, the NoHo Arts District will
get back to business.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, the theater business.
</P>
<P>
   During the annual weekend street fair known as the NoHo Theatre
&AMP; Arts Festival it's easy to forget that North Hollywood's NoHo
Arts District wasn't conceived primarily as a place to bargain-hunt
for greeting cards and boutique candles, or to witness sweaty
displays of Turkish belly dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after the district was born, live theater remains its
main mission, its raison d'etre.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, that mission will be reflected in more than 100
free performances at the festival by some 50 theater companies and
producing organizations from around metropolitan Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Averaging about 45 minutes apiece, the offerings will include
everything from a musical about one of the space shuttle Challenger
astronauts to a nine-women comedy set in a beauty salon, to
political satire, puppets, scenes from Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan's
``Patience'' and a piece called ``Cacti &AMP; I,'' presented by Theatre
Unlimited and described as involving ``comic cacti rustling and
voodoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides these events, held at 13 NoHo ``host'' theaters,
there'll also be free outdoor performances by doo-wop and folk
groups, clog-dancing and Celtic music, a food festival, an open-air
arts and crafts fair and a Kids Court.
</P>
<P>
   Hot dogs and pizza will be consumed, prepubescent faces will be
painted, ear cuffs and pottery will be purchased, and Baptist
choirs will make a joyful noise. Last year, police estimated total
attendance at around 35,000 over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But when the two-day frenzy ceases Sunday night, the theater
community will resume the greater, unending challenge of putting
together new seasons of plays, selling subscription tickets and
attracting new audiences. That's when the NoHo Festival really pays
for itself as a high-profile form of group advertising, organizers
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a numbers game, and when I talk to some of the other
theaters, they tell me they've gotten a lot of people as
subscribers or repeat customers based on their initial contact with
the festival,'' says Edmund Gaynes, festival co-chairman and
president of the 45-member Valley Theatre League, which is
presenting the event in concert with the Universal City-North
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage repeat business, the league again will be selling
summer theater discount passes between noon and 6 p.m. both days.
The passbook, which costs $40, consists of 10 passes that may be
used at any of 24 participating Valley theaters. Books will be on
sale at the Valley Theatre League tent near the intersection of
Lankershim and Magnolia boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of it (the festival) is for people who may
not be aware that there is a large, vital theater community, not
only in NoHo but throughout the Valley,'' says Gaynes, who also
runs the Two Roads Theatre in Studio City and has produced shows
off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theaters are the main reason for the festival. They are
the main draw, so many people who come clearly are interested in
theater, or they wouldn't show.''
</P>
<P>
   When local grass-roots arts activists and the city's Cultural
Affairs Department dreamed up the district, they envisioned a
free-spirited community of resourceful bohemians mixing with office
workers, small business owners and coffeehouse connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   NoHo was to be the city's largest publicly supported arts zone.
Later, the City Council got into the act by passing a zoning change
making it possible for artists to live and work in the same space
without having to wade through bureaucratic red tape.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a once-grim stretch of Lankershim Boulevard has
morphed into an unpretentious cultural hub, the eye of a
1.5-square-mile area containing some 20 theaters, mostly small,
Equity-waiver houses with fewer than 100 seats. It's also home to
art dealers, used-bookstore owners, the tattooed and the
fashionably sullen, commingling with white-collar employees of
Disney's Interactive division and the Academy of Television Arts
and Sciences, which anchor opposite corners of Lankershim and
Magnolia.
</P>
<P>
   This NoHo _ the workaday NoHo _ is more than a once-a-year
happening. It's a round-the-clock yet low-key hangout where you can
witness live performances five days a week, buy a nouveau-Gothic
painting at Dark's Art Parlour, stop in for joe at Eagles Coffee
Pub or the Eclectic Cafe and peruse an exhibition of fine-art
prints at the Lankershim Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it hasn't turned into Times Square or Manhattan's
illustrious Soho arts district, with which NoHo's boosters draw
frequent comparisons. But it's a neighborhood with a style all its
own. Enjoy your visit.

DEMOCRATS BANK ON CONSERVATIVES TO RETAKE HOUSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, June 14) 
 
By DAN FREEDMAN 
c.1998 Hearst Newspapers 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pat Casey, Ken Lucas and Loy Sneary, who are
running for Congress this year, are all conservatives on certain
issues, including abortion and gun control. And they are all
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   They and at least six others represent a key element of
Democratic Party strategy for taking the House of Representatives
back from the Republicans. They are the only hope the party has of
winning in many rural districts in states such as Alabama, Idaho,
Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Texas _ fertile ground for the
Republicans in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   On divisive social issues such as late-term abortions and
waiting periods for handgun purchases, they fall outside Democratic
Party orthodoxy and march in lockstep with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is
coordinating House races this November, actively recruited them.
Doing so, DCCC officials admit, was a calculated risk. But running
conservative Democrats in these increasingly Republican districts
might prove crucial in helping the party recoup the 11 seats it
needs to recapture the House after four years of GOP rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to impose any kind of liberal agenda on
anyone,'' said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, chairman of the DCCC.
``Our attitude is the candidate should fit the district.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats worry that by recruiting such conservatives,
the party is devaluing its bedrock beliefs and alienating many
moderates and liberals who comprise its base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take you any place and it erases your identity as a
party,'' said Bob Borosage, codirector of the liberal
Washington-based Campaign for America's Future. ``It should bother
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women's groups are particularly horrified. ``It's a concern
to us to see Democrats recruiting candidates who would take away a
woman's right to choose after we've made so much progress,'' said
Stephanie Cohen, spokeswoman for Emily's List, which raises money
for female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats involved in the nitty-gritty of restoring their
party's leadership in the House insist there is no other way to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gersh, a consultant who has advised the DCCC on candidate
recruitment, said, ``In certain districts it would be suicidal to
have a liberal run.``
</P>
<P>
   The main criterion for selecting candidates is a promise to vote
for a Democrat to be House speaker. ``Voting in a Democrat as
speaker means Democrats control committees, legislation, the entire
agenda,'' Gersh said. ``Anyone who doesn't understand the
difference between (House Speaker Newt) Gingrich and (House
Minority Leader Richard) Gephardt doesn't understand politics.``
</P>
<P>
   Gersh and other Democrats also say that while the nine
candidates are conservative on some issues, they support the
mainstream of the party on others and are rarely as conservative as
their Republican opponents.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans are amused by what they view as yet
another effort by Democrats to gain favor by aping GOP positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an acknowledgment by the Democratic leaders that their
ideas are the wrong ideas and the people who espouse them are not
electable,'' said Mary Crawford, spokeswoman for the National
Republican Congressional Committee, which coordinates GOP House
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Democrats are hardly a new phenomenon in Congress.
From at least the end of World War II to the early 1960s, Congress
was dominated by conservative Southern Democrats who favored
military spending and opposed civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the Blue Dog Coalition, with 24 House members,
represents the interests of the conservative Democratic
minority-within-a-minority. Coalition members have worked with the
DCCC to recruit conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Dogs focus on economic issues such as balancing the
budget and reducing the size of government. ``We're all over the
map on social issues,`` said Rep. Allen Boyd, a coalition member.
''We don't involve ourselves in them.``
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, this year's conservative Democrats are out front on
some social issues. Among those on the ballot are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ken Lucas, judge-executive in Boone County, Ky. Although
anti-abortion and pro-gun, he supports federal spending on Head
Start, school lunches and education loans. The Kentucky AFL-CIO
endorsed him. His opponent is state Sen. Gex ``Jay'' Williams, a
religious conservative supported by the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pat Casey, a lawyer and son of former Pennsylvania Gov. Bob
Casey, who was denied a chance to speak before the 1992 Democratic
National Convention because of his anti-abortion stance. Pat Casey
shares his father's views on abortion and opposes gun control. He
has the backing of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO in the Scranton-area
district. His GOP opponent is Don Sherwood, a car dealer who also
opposes abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   _ Loy Sneary, a cattle rancher, rice farmer and former judge in
Matagorda County southwest of Houston. Fitting the anti-abortion
and pro-gun profile of the district, Sneary is running against Rep.
Ron Paul, R-Texas, a colorful politician who opposes abortion, gun
control, foreign aid and federal aid to education. He is the
Democrats' top target in Texas this November.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joe Turnham, former chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party
who steered the party organization away from support of gun control
and abortion rights. But he has supported civil rights, an
important factor for black voters in the east central Alabama
district. His GOP opponent is Rep. Bob Riley, who won his first
term in 1996 with a bare 51 percent majority.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ronnie Shows, the regional transportation commissioner in
southern Mississippi, who opposes gun control, abortion and gay
rights. On the GOP side are two conservatives, tax lawyer Delbert
Hosemann and banker Phil Davis, who will compete June 23 for the
GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chris Gorman, former Kentucky state attorney general. He is
anti-abortion and pro-gun, as is the Republican he is challenging,
first-term incumbent Rep. Anne Northrup of Louisville. In 1996 she
campaigned for cuts in taxes, the size of government and the amount
of regulation of small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dave Phelps, a state representative and gospel singer running
for a vacant seat in southeast Illinois. Besides opposing abortion
rights and gun control, he favors school prayer, positions that his
Republican opponent, Brent Winters, a lawyer and farmer, agrees
with.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marjorie McKeithen, granddaughter of former Louisiana Gov.
John McKeithen. Running in Baton Rouge, she opposes abortion and
gun control and advocates a ``flatter'' tax system. But she
supports raising the minimum wage. Her GOP opponent, Rep. Richard
Baker, also anti-abortion and gun control, opposed raising the
minimum wage in 1996 but ultimately voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Richard Stallings, who left the House in 1992 after four terms
to make an unsuccessful Senate bid. Stallings is conservative on
abortion and gun control but moderate to liberal on many other
issues. The Republican nominee, Idaho state House Speaker Mike
Simpson, is pro-gun but has been attacked by anti-abortion
advocates as insufficiently committed to their cause.

8 NATIONS DEMAND END TO SERB ATTACKS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Reinforcing the NATO alliance's threat of military
action to stop the violence in Kosovo, the United States, Russia
and six other major industrial democracies meeting in London on
Friday demanded an immediate stop to Serb attacks on ethnic
Albanian civilians in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign ministers of the eight countries gave President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia until Tuesday to call off the offensive. He
is expected to see Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the country
most hesitant to consent to the use of force against the Serbs, in
Moscow that day.
</P>
<P>
   Russia joined Friday in urging Milosevic to use their meeting as
an occasion to announce compliance with other demands made by the
United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The other demands were that Milosevic allow international
monitors unimpeded and continuous access to Kosovo, let refugees
who fled Kosovo return to their homes with international aid and
resume talks with the Kosovo Albanian leadership under Ibrahim
Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 people have been killed in the fighting so far,
international officials believe, and between 60,000 and 85,000 have
been displaced during the Serb offensive in the province, which is
90 percent ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic will be making a grave mistake if he
imagines the international community will be as slow to respond in
Kosovo as it was in Bosnia,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said after the meeting Friday, which was originally called to
coordinate the international response to nuclear weapons tests last
month by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The group of eight countries issued a statement Friday warning
Milosevic that if international demands were not met, there would
be ``moves to further measures to halt the violence and protect the
civilian population, including those that may require the
authorization of a U.N. Security Council resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said, ``We're all
working together as much as we can on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministers also urged the International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia in The Hague to extend its writ to cover
crimes against humanity in Kosovo by Serb commanders and their
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   France, like Russia, has been insisting that before any NATO air
strikes or peacekeeping missions can be undertaken, a Security
Council resolution is needed to authorize the use of force in
Kosovo. The French said Friday's statement indicated that Russia
would deliver a strong message to Milosevic in Moscow next week.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Friday that
Moscow remained opposed to military action, but Hubert Vedrine, his
French counterpart, said, ``I think the Russian position is not yet
their last word.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States believes existing U.N. resolutions regarding
the former Yugoslavia provide sufficient authority for any military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine emphasized the importance of keeping Russia, a
traditional ally of Serbia, in the emerging international consensus
that the world may have to step in to stop the fighting from
spilling over into the rest of the Balkans if Milosevic does not
respond quickly. Russia did agree to the warning the group issued
Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meeting in Belgium on Thursday, NATO defense ministers
commissioned contingency plans for military intervention, including
possible air strikes against strategic military targets in Serbia,
and scheduled a large-scale demonstration of NATO air power across
the border from Kosovo in Albania and Macedonia that could take
place next week.
</P>
<P>
   The British Defense Ministry said Friday that the exercise could
involve some 40 aircraft from more than six NATO countries,
including Britain and the United States. Russia said it would not
participate.
</P>
<P>
   All except Russia and Japan have banned investment in Serbia and
frozen Serb assets held in their countries, and added an additional
sanction Friday by banning flights by Yugoslav airlines to their
territory. Japan, but not Russia, supported the ban and said it
would consider similar action.
</P>
<P>
   With Rugova, the ethnic Albanian leader, in London for talks
with some of the foreign ministers, the group also said that it
expected him to make clear that it rejected violence and acts of
terrorism, and said it was essential that ``Kosovo Albanian
extremists'' refrain from violent acts that the Serbs could use as
a pretext for continuing their offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright and the other ministers made clear that they
believed Milosevic, not Rugova, was at fault for the premature
suspension of negotiations that had been arranged last month by
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke, who got the United States and
the allies to hold off on economic sanctions so the talks could
begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The violence escalated to such a point that the talks had to
be suspended,'' Albright said, and the United States did not
believe Rugova had any choice but to break them off.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his reaction to the NATO decisions earlier this week,
Rugova said, ``I asked for more, but this is all right.'' &QL;

REPORT FROM E-3, THE GAME EXPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past decade, the electronic gaming industry has gone from
a few hundred-thousand Atari game consoles hooked to home
televisions to a $10-billion-a-year industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the expansion more evident than at the Electronic
Entertainment Exposition, a trade show also known as E3 that
features all the newest and latest game gear. This year, as last,
it was held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta the
last weekend in May. About 40,000 people attended during its
four-day run.
</P>
<P>
   (Although it is a game-player's dream, there were no kids _ they
were excluded from E3 this year. Sony PlayStation officials took
that opportunity to set up a ``PlayStation City'' exhibit near the
center so kids could see some of the offerings inside E3 as well as
preview new PlayStation games.)
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit filled more than 35 football fields of space. If the
show is any indication, it looks like the coming year will bring
more of the same in computer games, an increase of the CD-like
disks called DVD that holds more than CDs, and more talking toys
that are built around computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   My Interactive Pooh from Mattel is one of them. Pooh joins
Barney and Barbie on the talk circuit. He sings more than two dozen
songs and plays about a dozen games. By linking him to the
computer, Pooh can be programmed to say the child's name, and other
features can be customized.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel is also expanding on its Barbie line with Barbie's Photo
Designer Digital Color Camera. The digital camera stores only six
photos at a time, which can be connected to a computer so they can
be saved for future use. Once in the computer, the child can use
the photos in other projects or with Barbie programs to make
postcards.
</P>
<P>
   (For more information: www.mattelmedia.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers are positioning DVD to replace CD-ROMs. One of the
attractions is the ability of a DVD to hold more than CDs. Take,
for instance, the announcement made at E3 by Mindscape Inc. The
company said that this fall it will bring out The Complete National
Geographics: 109 Years of National Geographic Magazine on DVD.
Actually, the more-correct title would have ended ``on DVDs.'' The
190,000 pages of National Geographic will span four DVD disks. The
CD-ROM version of the program, currently available, covers 31
disks.
</P>
<P>
   Mindscape will also expand on the National Geographic magazine
theme this fall when it publishes National Geographic Maps, a
four-CD collection of every fold-out map published in National
Geographic. The company will also join the trip-planning arena in
the fall with the release of National Geographic Trip Planner
Deluxe for planning trips in the U.S. and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   (For more information: www.mindscape.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Well-known learning software titles for children and young
adults from Davidson &AMP; Associates won't be sold under the Davidson
name any more. The products, which include the JumpStart Learning
System, the Blaster Learning System and Fisher-Price titles, will
be sold under the Knowledge Adventure brand.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement came at E3, along with another from the
company on its new assessment technology feature being incorporated
into its JumpStart Learning System programs. Before using the
software, kids will take an assessment test so the program can
determine where the child needs the most help. Then the program
will begin at the most appropriate level for that child.
</P>
<P>
   The new test will be included in soon-to-be released revamped
titles, JumpStart Preschool and JumpStart 1st Grade. It will also
be in a new title, JumpStart Adventures 6th Grade. The produces are
expected to be available in late summer or early fall. The price
will be in the $30 range.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the company name change, the Web address
changes, too: www.knowledgeadventure.com

SINATRA STYLE STILL RESONATES IN FASHION WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; He had the voice and the Rat Pack fame, but more
than that, Frank Sinatra had style.
</P>
<P>
   You thought Kramer's bowling shirts were pure ``Kramer''?
According to Elena Hart of the Fashion Association in New York,
that ensemble, accented with pointy shoes and a cigar, were part of
Sinatra's signature wardrobe long before ``Seinfeld'' made TV
fashion history.
</P>
<P>
   And what about all those pinstripe suits he wore in ``Guys and
Dolls''? Hart says you can find similar looks today in the latest
Claiborne for Men collection, while Members Only still produces the
very same golf jacket Sinatra wore on the links.
</P>
<P>
   To see more of Sinatra's personal style, cruise over to Concours
on Rodeo at 10 a.m. June 21. The crooner's car _ a 1956 Thunderbird
_ will be among the 75 vintage and classic celebrity-owned
automobiles displayed on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The free Father's Day event is sponsored by Chrysler Corp.,
Beverly Hills Motoring and the Rodeo Drive Committee. The Concours
on Rodeo is part of the California Classic Weekend that begins
Friday with the Cars and Stars gala at Petersen Automotive Museum,
6060 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles. For more information, call (310)
858-6100.
</P>
<P>
   BEAUTY BIZ: Hard Candy, maker of that nifty nail polish with the
little ring, now has compacts for the galaxy girl on the go. The
silver cases are filled with creamy blusher and metallic
highlighter and tucked into a holographic compact pouch, priced at
$26 at Macy's and other department stores.
</P>
<P>
   To get that perfect fake tan without orange hands, the Beach
Self-Tanning Kit now includes a pair of Beach Mitz. The palm-shaped
mitts stick to the palms of your hands so you can apply the
quick-tanning cream everywhere, even the tops of your hands. Then
peel off and throw away.
</P>
<P>
   The kit is $22, and extra packages of Beach Mitz are $6. You can
find them at Nordstrom at Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park; or call
(800) 648-9729 to place an order.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE KIDS: The latest bandage for children is soooo cute,
your darlings will probably start faking injuries. Why, even Miz
Hot Tips covered her paper cut with the pink-eyed frog, which is
one of several tattoolike designs from 3M Nexcare Waterproof
Bandages. Other designs on the clear plastic strips are happy
faces, teddy bears, peace signs and tigers, priced at $3.49 a box
at Target and numerous drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   UNDER HER SPELL: Celeste Mills counts to three, snaps her
fingers, and you no longer need a ciggie. Magic? Nah, it's
hypnotherapy, now endorsed by the American Cancer Society as an
effective tool to stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, this Magic Castle magician has used hypnosis
to help cancer patients endure chemotherapy, and now she's working
her spell on smokers.
</P>
<P>
   A volunteer with the Valley branch of the American Cancer
Society, Mills will be conducting classes June 22 at the Holiday
Inn in Burbank; June 24 at the Holiday Inn in Woodland Hills; and
June 25 at the Holiday Inn in Palmdale. Show up at 7 p.m. with
$59.95, and she'll send you home smoke-free, with a reinforcement
tape plus a ``Kiss me, I quit'' badge. For more information, call
Mills at (818) 783-8209.
</P>
<P>
   SENIORS ON THE LOOSE: Do you sit home alone, wishing for an
adventure but too scared to go solo? Miz Hot Tips has the ticket _
a group tour of Asia with a bunch of over-60 folks for $1,299
(includes round-trip air fare, hotels, food and travel guides). To
hear more about it, attend the meeting 1:30 p.m. July 10 at Valley

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steven Dillon, a hairstylist at the high-end Brad
Johns salon on Fifth Avenue, who tends to the manes of Natasha
Richardson and young society swans like Carolina Herrera Jr., has
found himself at the center of a social whirl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe the number of things I get invited to every
week,'' Dillon said. He was Ms. Richardson's guest at the opening
night of ``Cabaret,'' in which she stars as Sally Bowles. He was
also asked to be a co-chairman of a benefit for Lou Gehrig's
disease and was invited to a Chuck Close retrospective at the
Museum of Modern Art _ never mind that, as he put it, ``I didn't
know anything about Chuck Close until the invitation arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Hershberger, a Los Angeles hairstylist who created Meg
Ryan's artfully mussed bob in ``City of Angels,'' attended the
Academy Awards in March with Ms. Ryan and Dennis Quaid and landed a
coveted invitation to Vanity Fair's post-Oscar party. More recently
she turned up in New York, invited by Madonna to attend a birthday
celebration for Ingrid Cesares, a nightclub owner, at the Kit Kat
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, it seems we're going out more than usual,'' Ms.
Hershberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it does. Hairstylists and makeup artists who cater to
celebrities and socialites are as likely to turn up at A-list
parties these days as their clients _ feted, befriended and fussed
over. The people who clip, snip and apply streaks of buttery blond
coloring _ once viewed as members of a service class _ are emerging
as new social lions in an era that is increasingly image-obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Fekkai, the leading celebrity hairdresser of the 1990s,
is routinely invited to mingle with the bon ton by such formidable,
nationally prominent hostesses as Betsy Bloomingdale in California
and Lynn Wyatt in Texas. ``He's a businessman and an artist, the
Christian Dior of his generation,'' said Mrs. Wyatt, who introduced
him to a gathering of her friends in Houston last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wyatt, bred in the old school of social proprieties, is not
unaware of the irony: the gates of the social elite swung open to
admit, first, fashion designers like Geoffrey Beene and, now,
hairstylists and other beauty professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten or 15 years ago, you might not have asked a dress designer
to your party,'' she said. ``And inviting your hairdresser, well,
that would have been unthinkable. But lots of things used to be
unthinkable. All I can say is, times have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fekkai, who operated the beauty salon at Bergdorf Goodman from
1989 to 1996, when he opened Beaute de Provence on East 57th
Street, recalls his admission to Los Angeles' gilded inner circle
with a mixture of awe and amusement. Invited by the producer Steve
Tisch to a dinner preceding a Rolling Stones concert last fall, he
found himself seated with Tom Freston, the chairman of MTV
Networks, and Sheryl Crow, the singer. ``If I told the friends that
I grew up with in the south of France where I had been and who I
had seen, they would say, `Wow, he's hallucinating,''' Fekkai said.
</P>
<P>
   Such spectacular evenings only top the list of perks enjoyed by
the grooming world's fabulous few: limousines furnished by generous
clients to speed them to appointments, tickets to movie premieres
and, not least, friendships cemented in the stylists' chair. Philip
Berkovitz, the Beverly Hills hair treatment specialist known
professionally as Philip B., often serves tea in his garden to his
friend and longtime client, Lynda Obst, the producer of films like
``Hope Floats.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Ms. Hershberger is in New York, she says she likes to
have dinner with pals like Richard Gere at Da Silvano, a favorite
downtown haunt of actors, artists and high-profile magazine
editors.
</P>
<P>
   Hair and makeup artists haven't always basked in such glamour.
In the more formal climate of the early 1960s, Kenneth Battelle,
who created Jacqueline Kennedy's bouffant hairstyle, felt compelled
to keep a low social profile.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as half a dozen years ago, Battelle fretted that his
friendship with Joan Rivers, who had recently moved to New York,
might hamper her ambitions. ``Joan is not going to make it in New
York in the social swing of things if she's out with her
hairdresser all the time,'' he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   At photo shoots just a decade ago, ``we used to be on the low
end of the totem pole, a notch above the caterer,'' recalled Kevyn
Aucoin, the makeup artist and best-selling author, who is at least
as famous as some of his clients. By contrast, ``socially, these
days it's wild,'' said Aucoin, who whiles away his leisure hours
with Cher and Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   Aucoin still can't get over his newfound social cachet. ``I feel
like I'm one of these people who has somehow snuck in to a secret
society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He needn't have been so modest. Aucoin's climb up the ladder
comes at a time when hair and makeup artists have never wielded
more influence as image makers, attaching their names to cosmetics
lines, drawing crowds at store appearances, and writing makeover
books that climb best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair and makeup artists are the newest style gurus,'' said
Jennifer Josephy, the editor of ``Making Faces,'' Aucoin's
coffee-table book (Little Brown, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   But if that is true, they owe much of their stardom to an
elevated definition of their craft. ``These people are in what used
to be known as a service industry,'' said Linda Wells, the editor
in chief of Allure, the beauty magazine, ``but now they are thought
of as creative types, as important as artists and trendsetters as
some of the better-known clients.''
</P>
<P>
   By promoting stylists as celebrities, Allure has played a
significant role in raising their profile, a development Ms. Wells
has come to rue. ``Lately,'' she joked, ``it's a lot harder to book
Kevyn for a sitting than to get Jewel to play at your bat
mitzvah.''

<P>
   Friday afternoon, temperatures at Charleston, S.C., soared to a
record-tying 95 degrees as a warm ridge of high pressure centered
over the eastern Gulf of Mexico extended its canopy of sizzling
heat northward.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, temperatures will soar to 100 degrees in parts of east
South Carolina and east Georgia as breezes from the west warm on
descent from the mountains and boost afternoon heat. Isolated
thunderstorms will provide spotty relief, given the lack of
high-altitude cooling needed to extensively destabilize the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Over eastern North Carolina and eastern Virginia, however, where
ample cooling aloft associated with an approaching disturbance is
juxtaposed over surface temperatures in the 90s, thunderstorms,
possibly severe, are more likely to erupt. Storms are possible as
far north as Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will douse parts of the northern Middle Atlantic and
southeast New England seaboards as steady onshore winds import
Atlantic moisture. Ocean winds, whose persistence will be
guaranteed by low pressure developing farther south along the
Middle Atlantic coast, will average 20 to 30 mph from eastern Long
Island to Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, powerful thunderstorms will erupt later Saturday
across the western Plains from northwest Texas to the Dakotas as an
expanse of cold air aloft moves over gathering warmth and moisture
at the surface. The greatest threat of severe weather will come
over Nebraska and Kansas, where a compact disturbance vigorously
lifts increasingly humid air. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WARM FRONT BLOCKADE
</P>
<P>
   In a struggle between a warm front and the Atlantic Ocean in
June, the ``Big Pond'' usually wins when the battle takes place in
eastern New England. A warm front is an opportunist, only staking
claim to battleground from which cool air has already retreated. In
spring and early summer, when ocean waters off New England are
still cool, a pattern that promotes steady onshore winds can keep
reinforcing cool air, thereby thwarting the advance of a warm
front. Saturday, a warm front attached to a low in Canada will
stall in the Northeast as cool ocean winds persist. Protracted
rains are likely. &QL;

 NEW YORK: bat mitzvah.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aware of their new clout, the savviest hair and makeup stylists
have positioned themselves as advisers on everything from the
texture of clients' lipstick to the color of their shoes.
``Hairstylists are really the designers of the '90s,'' said Dillon,
who added that his clients seek his advice on everything from where
to vacation to what to wear to a premiere. ``And if I tell them, `I
want you in this dress' or `those mules,' you can believe that
they'll do what I say.''
</P>
<P>
   Fekkai, who still finds time eight or 10 days each month to cut
clients' hair, recently placed his logo on a collection of canvas
handbags, sunglasses and candles. ``Today, the business is not just
hair,'' he said. ``It's about life style and creating a total
look.''
</P>
<P>
   But though a handful of hairstylists now compete with designers
as taste makers, few show signs of taking themselves as seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to have hairstylists at your party because they are
unintimidating and refreshingly accessible,'' said Jean
Godfrey-June, the beauty and fitness director of Elle magazine.
``Unlike designers, who are all so corporate now, these people
don't have to be so careful about what they say. They are plugged
in to a more fun kind of world, a surface world where fashion
begins.''
</P>
<P>
   The most socially savvy of the lot have parlayed their
popularity into sidelines as party hosts in their own right. Art
Luna, a high-octane hairstylist in West Hollywood, arranges
frequent dinners for 10 or 12, for favored clients like Anjelica
Huston and Sally Fields, who begin the evening with wine in his
garden, a miniature Eden replete with ferns, jasmine, bamboo and a
fountain brimming with seashells and quartz.
</P>
<P>
   The ebullient Luna views his newest hobby as a natural extension
of his work. ``I'm already a glorified host,'' he said. ``I see
myself as entertaining clients in their chairs all day.''
</P>
<P>
   At night, those very clients are inclined to make a fuss over
him. Ms. Wells, who recently attended one of Luna's palmy,
candlelighted dinners, found him surrounded by fawning members of
the Hollywood elite, including Kelly Lynch, Daryl Hannah, Jeanne
Tripplehorn and Gina Gershon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were crowding around him, but that was
understandable,'' Ms. Wells mused. ``In a city like L.A., where
your beauty is your currency, everyone wanted to get in with Art,
just to make sure that when the moment arrived, they'd be able to
get an appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's light years from the day when to be seen on the arm of your
hairdresser was to court social ruin. ``These days, one of the
smartest things you can do for your looks is to party with a
hairdresser,'' Ms. Wells said. ``And the best thing you can do for
your social life is to marry one.''

NEW ZEALAND GIANT SHOWS NEW INTEREST IN U.S. MARKET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL LONSFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With even some of the smallest New Zealand wineries entering the
U.S. market, it seemed strange last January when I visited the
largest Kiwi winery _ Montana _ only to be told it didn't export to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's changed.
</P>
<P>
   Montana, the 500-pound gorilla of New Zealand, makes several
separate tiers of estate-bottled wines under different vineyard
designations, and now it's launching its Brancott Vineyards wines
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Montana's Brancott Estate, at 570 acres, is the single largest
vineyard in New Zealand, located in the Marlborough region at the
north end of New Zealand's South Island. Indeed, Montana was the
pioneer in Marlborough, traditionally a sheep-farming region, when
it established the Brancott Estate in 1973. Other winery ventures
have followed suit, of course, the best known being Cloudy Bay,
just down the road from Brancott.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are a number of Brancott wines being made, this
first venture, marketed nationally by Seagram's, consists of five
white wines. Since wines show best (generally) when paired with
food, I tasted the Brancott wines at the chef's table in DeVille
Restaurant, where chef Tim Keating prepared a special lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Keating, not afraid to mix and match, changed the order of
serving the wines to go with his dishes _ and it worked.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Brancott wines is the 1996 Patutahi Vineyard
Gewrztraminer ($23.99) _ 4 stars _ a spicy white wine with a hint
of sweetness. I would've expected this wine to be served with
dessert, but instead Keating served it with the first course, which
was an ``Asian Cocktail of Crabmeat and Shrimp'' with what he
called ``piquant spices.'' Excellent match, the spiciness of the
seafood going hand-in-glove with the slight sweetness of the wine.
</P>
<P>
   (Note to Keating: Should you opt for a French wine next time
with that Asian dish, try the 1996 Marc Brdif Vouvray, an off-dry
Loire white that goes really well with spicy crawfish, among other
dishes ...
</P>
<P>
   Montana's too smart to send questionable wines into a new
market, so all the Brancott wines showed well. My favorite, because
of its pungent, grassy style, was the 1996 Brancott Sauvignon Blanc
($25.99) _ 4 1/2 stars _ which illustrated why the Marlborough
region is so fertile for sauvignon blanc. The 1997 Reserve
Sauvignon Blanc ($16.99) _ 4 stars _ with its crisp but somewhat
rounded citrusy taste was a good aperitif.
</P>
<P>
   Keating literally turned the tables on us. The gewrztraminer was
served first (not last), so naturally the sauvignon blanc was
served last (not first), with a selection of three mild cheeses.
And again, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Although all three chardonnays were barrel-fermented, they
remained a contrast, ranging from the 1997 Gisborne Reserve
Chardonnay ($16.99) _ 3 1/2 stars _ with its ripe, tropical-fruit
profile, to the 1996 Ormond Vineyard Chardonnay ($23.99) _ 4 stars
_ with more butter and toast. The 1996 Renwick Vineyard Chardonnay
($23.99) _ 4 1/2 stars _ tasted more like a white burgundy, with a
touch of ``terroir,'' or taste of the soil, married with the
butterscotch and vanilla nuances.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line on Brancott Vineyards from New Zealand: not
inexpensive, but well-made wines. Hopefully not too long from now,
more Montana wines will wind their way here, including some of the
less expensive ones. Those that I tasted in New Zealand were
bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Wine rating: 5 stars, outstanding; 4 stars, fine; 3 stars, good;
2 stars, fair, 1 star, poor. &QL;

`DIRTY WORK': A BRAIN-DEAD COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you thought the Asian economy was bad, try assessing the
state of film comedy on the basis of ``Dirty Work.'' Phrases like
terminally stupid and brain dead leap readily to mind.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour into this leaden, taste-deprived attempted comedy
about a couple of losers whose contribution to American capitalism
is a revenge-for-hire business, a surprise arrives in the form of a
funny joke about the circumstances surrounding a photograph in an
old man's locket. The joke is crude, but almost everything is in
this lifeless comedy. Still, it is a joke.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing roused by ``Dirty Work,'' directed by Bob
Saget, a host of ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' is the
suspicion that sleeping pills have been administered to most of the
cast, which includes Chevy Chase as a doctor in thrall to gamblers
and Don Rickles as a nasty theater manager.
</P>
<P>
   Others responsible for the low comic wattage of ``Dirty Work''
include Norm Macdonald, a ``Saturday Night Live'' alumnus who was a
co-writer of the script and shares with Artie Lange the onerous
burden of having to act in it.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald and Lange star as Mitch and Sam. Mitch is the
good-looking one. Sam is the fat clown. Friends since childhood,
they have reached their 30s without distinction. Mitch has lost 14
jobs in three months; Sam lives with his father, Pops (Jack
Warden), a belligerent, impotent old man who spends most of his
time shouting for whores.
</P>
<P>
   After a tiresomely long buildup, the plot finally lurches into
motion when Pops has a heart attack. Dr. Farthing (Chase) says that
he needs a heart transplant but is too old to qualify as a priority
case. But Dr. Farthing is a compulsive gambler whose creditors are
in the process of breaking his arms and shooting off his toes.
</P>
<P>
   So he suggests to Mitch and Sam that $50,000 might help matters,
which prompts them to resurrect one of their childhood successes:
creative revenge in the form of a business called Dirty Work, which
consists of projects like removing the beard from an abusive
bearded lady in a circus, planting dead fish in a lavish but loud
home and loosing skunks into the audience at a performance of ``Don
Giovanni.''
</P>
<P>
   For parched wanderers in the desert of comedy that is ``Dirty
Work,'' this scene makes memories of the Marx Brothers at work on
``Il Trovatore'' in ``A Night at the Opera'' seem like the happiest
of hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
   Far too often in ``Dirty Work,'' the supposedly funny business
happens offscreen, and the idea of putting popcorn in an automobile
engine is considered so hilarious that it gets a reprise.
</P>
<P>
   But Dirty Work brings about a romance for Mitch and a conflict
with Travis Cole (Christopher McDonald), the community's devious
and very wealthy real estate developer. So in the end, of course,
all ends well.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Don't bother to hang around for the outtakes. They're not
funny either.
</P>

FOR SHORT-TERM SAVINGS, MUTUAL FUNDS ARE TOO AGGRESSIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 26. My long-term goal is to retire very comfortably, and
my short-term goal is to purchase a home around age 30. I invest
$90 a week in my 401(k) account, and have a current balance of
$6,000 that is 60 percent invested in the George Putnam Fund of
Boston and 20 percent each in Putnam OTC and Emerging Growth and in
Fidelity Advisor Overseas. I also have $2,000 in a savings account,
and when it reaches $3,000 I plan to put it in Vanguard's Balanced
Index fund, adding $500 monthly. Am I on the right track to reach
my goals? How much will I have for my retirement years?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A.A., Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You are certainly on the right track and over the long term
you should do very well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you likely won't attain the retirement goal without
additional savings, and the purchase of your first house may be
closer to five years away than four.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how I calculate. If you continue saving for retirement by
putting away $4,680 a year, you would amass $2,060,438 over 39
years, presuming average 10 percent annual growth. Invested to
produce an income stream (at a portfolio average 7 percent), you
could expect an income of $144,230 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble comes when you adjust for inflation. At 4 percent
average annual inflation, that $144,230 wilts down to the buying
power of $31,243 in today's money. If inflation averaged only 3
percent, the current value would be $45,541 _ still probably not
enough for a very comfortable lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that you needn't fret. I suggest you calculate
the percentage of your current income that is going toward
retirement and then maintain that percentage during your working
years.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, every time you get a raise, you bump your contributions to
the retirement pool. The result is that if your raises tend to
match or beat the inflation rate, you will thus be countering the
effect of inflation, and will indeed be very comfortably fixed in
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   As for the house savings, I advise against moving to a mutual
fund, even an excellent one such as Vanguard Balanced Index. For
short-term savings, mutual funds are too aggressive; a market
downturn could take a serious bite out of your savings over the
short term.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you stick with money markets, CDs, US Treasury
securities, and the like for your home-purchase savings. If you
contribute $500 a month to this pool and achieve average annual
returns of 5 percent, over four years you would accumulate $28,883,
which is probably enough for a condo down payment; after five
years, you would have a more comfortable $36,464, which would widen
your purchase options _ and remember that the higher your down
payment is, the lower the interest rate you are likely to get on
the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   As for your 401(k) funds, it seems mostly solid, but I would
watch Putnam OTC and Emerging Growth fairly closely. After
excellent performance from 1992 to 1995, it fell to bottom-quartile
results the next two years. Its performance has improved this year,
but it is still running slightly behind the average for its mid-cap
growth peers.
</P>
<P>
   If there are attractive alternatives in the small-cap or mid-cap
arena on your 401(k) menu, and if your fund doesn't soon return to
superior performance, I'd consider a change.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 54, married, and looking for retirement advice. My
current retirement portfolio consists of a 401(k) plan that
contains $110,000 invested in Putnam Growth and Income and $107,000
in Putnam High Yield Advantage funds. Other assets include $124,000
in common stocks and $115,000 parked in a money market fund. I also
have a life insurance annuity that will pay out $80,000 in the year
2002. At retirement, besides Social Security payments estimated at
$1,400 a month, I will also have a small pension of $300 a month.
My goal is to have at least $60,000 annual income in retirement.
What do you recommend I do with the 401(k)? Other available funds
are Putnam's Voyager, OTC and Emerging Growth, and International.
Do we need more than the 401(k) savings to reach our goal?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; F.T., Duxbury
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You should be in fine shape with your savings at the current
level.
</P>
<P>
   With the $9,500 annual additions, the 401(k) should grow to
$669,881 over 11 years, presuming an average 8 percent annual
return. If we make the same assumption for your common stocks, that
segment of the portfolio would be worth $289,123 after 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   If you simply let that $115,000 rot in a money fund _ and the
truth is I would not be a whole lot more aggressive _ it would add
up to $196,689.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you were to invest the annuity payout that comes in
2002 in a good GNMA fund yielding 6.5 percent a year, you could
expect that to grow to $124,318 over the next seven years. That
takes us to a grand total of $1,280,011 _ a great deal more than
you will need to supply your expected needs.
</P>
<P>
   As for investments, I'm going to presume your current portfolio
reflects a pretty conservative guy _ after all, you have about 55
percent of your savings in fixed-income holdings. As I said, I'm
not very positive about stocks at this point, so I won't argue.
</P>
<P>
   But I would at least move the money market funds to Fidelity
Spartan GNMA or Vanguard GNMA. This should get you about a 1.5
percentage point better yield than a money market fund, and over 11
years the interest-rate bumps to which bond funds are prey should
balance themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the difference between a 5 percent yield on $115,000
and a 6.5 percent yield on the same investment works out to $33,313
_ enough to give you some comfort even if things don't work as I
presume.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you put this money (as well as annuity proceeds when
they arrive) in such a fund, by the time you retire the fixed
income side _ these funds plus the Putnam High Yield Advantage
account _ will have grown to a size sufficient to meet your
projected income needs.
</P>
<P>
   You could thus leave the balance of the portfolio in equities to
protect you against the likely effects of inflation after
retirement.
</P>
<P>

WHEAT FUTURES CLOSE HIGHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA SIZEMORE LONG  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City wheat futures and Chicago wheat, corn and soybean
futures prices closed higher Friday, following early losses that
came after government crop reports.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Value Line stock-index futures closed down only
slightly after sharp early losses.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks sold off sharply early after the Producer Price Index was
released and further pressure came from bonds, said Kansas City
trader Mark Grismore.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after bonds closed, the market came rip-roaring back,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Western Natural Gas futures closed up sharply on talk of warmer
weather linked to the La Nina phenomenon, which causes hotter
temperatures and less precipitation in summer.
</P>
<P>
   In grains, wheat futures were helped by short-covering after
recent declines. Prices also rose after the Agriculture Department
lowered its estimate for 1998 soft red winter wheat production. The
USDA did, however, increase its winter wheat estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Corn futures closed higher on concern about the potential for
hot and dry weather soon in growing regions. Meanwhile, the crop
estimate for 1998 corn remained unchanged from last month at 9.6
billion bushels.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean futures closed up as much as 9 cents a bushel on growing
concern about the potential for hot and dry weather this summer.
Prices also rose on signs of strong demand for soybean products
such as oil and meal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government's soybean projection was steady at a
record 2.8 billion bushels.

DANCE REVIEW: A 3-WAY ADVENTURE IN PARTNERING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Martins has had a long fascination with ballet
partnering. In his ``River of Light,'' presented by the New York
City Ballet in its world premiere Thursday night at the New York
State Theater, Martins continues his exploration of what partnering
can mean in ballet of the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Martins also continues his exploration of new music with ``River
of Light,'' which was choreographed in celebration of the 60th
birthday of Charles Wuorinen. Wuorinen conducted this first
performance of the ballet and will conduct the work through the
City Ballet season. Set to a commissioned score with the same
title, the new ballet is the fourth collaboration between Martins
and Wuorinen.
</P>
<P>
   Martins touched on the subject of partnering in ``Calcium Light
Night,'' his first choreography for the company that he now heads.
That ballet, created in 1977, was set to pieces by Charles Ives, a
composer who, like Wuorinen, is thought of as uncompromisingly
modern. The quirky astringency of ``Calcium Light Night'' came in
part from the distinctive stage personality of Heather Watts, who
danced the earliest performances with Daniel Duell.
</P>
<P>
   Even then Martins, himself an accomplished partner schooled in
the traditions of 19th-century classical ballet, was enlarging on
the experimentation of George Balanchine with partnering that
reflected changing music and society.
</P>
<P>
   For Martins, such experimentation could push the boundaries of
the traditional challenges inherent in two people dancing as one,
enhancing the sense of a ``play of forces which gives a sense of
drama,'' as he later wrote in his autobiography, in partnering that
nakedly revealed ``dynamic interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   There are glimpses of ``Calcium Light Night'' _ and of
Balanchine's ``Episodes'' and ``Ivesiana'' _ in ``River of Light.''
And no startlingly new points are being made in the Wuorinen
ballet. Martins seems to be settling into old ideas and imagery in
the new piece, allowing the dance to luxuriate in its jagged,
biting excesses.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography embodies the music's rising and waning tension.
And there are moments of unexpected texture and color comparable to
pools of tonal color in the music. A good deal of the physical
texture comes from the distinctive differences in the ways Martins'
three couples dance together at first. Each couple seems designated
to express a different facet of partnering in the three duets that
open the ballet, though the dancers soon change partners and blend
to some extent in this tightly knit work.
</P>
<P>
   It falls to Monique Meunier and Jock Soto, who are dressed in
black unitards and are the first couple out onstage, to represent
partnering in its most angular, urgent joining and pulling apart of
tightly wrapped bodies. Alexandra Ansanelli and Charles Askegard
are a more lyrical and innocent-seeming pair of partners, qualities
suggested, perhaps, not only by the comparative lyricism of their
dancing but also by their white unitards and the gentle impetuosity
of Ms. Ansanelli's long body.
</P>
<P>
   There is a suggestion of maturity in the relative languor and
the slight distance of Darci Kistler and Sebastien Marcovici in the
third duet. Dressed in red, they seem to represent a seasoned
variation on the romantic relationship inherent in all ballet
partnering.
</P>
<P>
   Each couple's dancers enter individually and proceed along a
rectangular path of white light that dissolves into a small, soft
pool. The effect enhances the choreographic shifts and the staging
of those opening duets.
</P>
<P>
   But lighting designer Mark Stanley undercuts Martins with the
hard, geometric patterns that follow, looking, distractingly, like
a Futurist design for a Broadway show. And the mixing and matching
of costume colors is eventually a little too neat.
</P>
<P>
   ``River of Light'' does not seem destined to become a signature
or even major Martins work with time. But Martins sends his six
dancers into some interesting adventures, delineated in a
performance of impressive clarity and commitment. And he ends on a
mystical note suggested by the ballet's title, as the women spin
slowly within their partners' arms first on the ground and then in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   The program also included a performance by Nichol Hlinka and
Damian Woetzel of Balanchine's ``Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux'' that was
breath-stopping in its musical and pyrotechnical daring.
Balanchine's ``Stars and Stripes,'' danced to Sousa marches
arranged by Hershy Kay, received a properly saucy performance from
a cast led by Jennie Somogyi, Aura Dixon, Tom Gold and Ms. Meunier
and Askegard. Darius Crenshaw stood out in the corps for the extra
snap and sparkle of his dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Martins and Wuorinen paid homage to Balanchine and Stravinsky
respectively in ``Reliquary,'' which completed the program. The
1996 ballet was performed ably enough by a cast headed by Samantha
Allen, Peter Boal, Wendy Whelan and Nila Martins, with the
demi-soloist roles taken by Ms. Dixon, Michele Gifford, Kathleen
Tracey, James Fayette, Peter Hansen and Arch Higgins. But Martins
failed to animate his quotations from Balanchine with any new life
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Wuorinen conducted his score for ``Reliquary.'' Maurice Kaplow
was the conductor for the Balanchine works. &QL;

LETTERS TO THE COLUMNIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's this? The mailbag is overflowing. No wonder, though. It's
been three months since this space was set aside for Valued
Contributors. So, let's rummage around in the pile and snare a few
of the most interesting missives.
</P>
<P>
   Well, well. Here's one concerning, of all things, Social
Security. Can you imagine anybody being interested in Social
Security?
</P>
<P>
   ``Regarding Social Security recipients receiving more back than
they invested. No one ever mentions the millions who died and never
received a cent back...Let's be fair. Whenever (you) mention SS
recipients getting more back, mention the millions who paid in and
received nothing.'' {Dear Mentioner:
</P>
<P>
   OK. How about those millions who paid into Social Security and
died before they could collect a penny in benefits? There! They've
been mentioned. While we're at it, how about those millions who
paid little or nothing into the system and nevertheless hit the
jackpot for a lifetime? Don't they also deserve a mention? Having
mentioned all this, what's the point? Social Security remains a
terribly flawed concept. It needs reforming to reflect the fact
that fewer and fewer workers are supporting more and more
beneficiaries. The past is irrelevant to the future.}
</P>
<P>
   Smoking is almost as hot a button these days as Social Security,
and the following view is one of the most frequently expressed:
</P>
<P>
   ``If people choose to smoke, that certainly is their right.
However, I don't think I should have to pay for their medical bills
when they're dying of lung cancer as a direct result of a (really
pretty stupid) decision they made with full information (it says
right on the package what the risks are).'' {Dear Stone-Heart:
</P>
<P>
   The great myth of the tobacco debate is that smokers' health
problems impose an economic cost on society. Several studies,
however, show just the opposite. Kip Viscusi, a Harvard Law School
professor, has done extensive research on this subject, for
instance. He found that smokers more than cover the external costs
of their habit. They die sooner and thus don't live long enough to
consume as much health care as the non-smoking elderly; moreover,
their tax burden as tobacco consumers is relatively higher than
non-users when they're alive.}
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of counterintuitive economic truisms, the trade
situation also confuses many readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think that trade (deficits) were a positive thing,''
says one, ``like money in the bank that would eventually be
returned to the USA to buy U.S. goods from us. Now I am beginning
to think this money is being used to turn us into some sort of
colony for foreign investors to exploit.'' {Dear Confused:
</P>
<P>
   If this is colonialism, then let's have more of it. Japan has a
humongous trade surplus and has been living an economic nightmare
for all of the 1990s. Some of the Asian ``tigers'' currently
experiencing the worst economic crises have been noteworthy for
their trade surpluses. The longer protectionists keep arguing that
trade deficits are the way to perdition, the better things keep
getting for a U.S. economy with growing trade deficits. Meanwhile,
the worse things keep getting for our trading partners with
substantial trade surpluses. Theory is one thing, but reality keeps
telling us something entirely different. Maybe the world has
changed and traditional economics hasn't caught up with these
changes.}
</P>
<P>
   Keep them cards and letters comin', hear?

JURY CONVICTS KANSAS CITY MAN WHO WHIPPED HIS SON TO DEATH WITH A
BELT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Jackson County Circuit Court jury on
Thursday convicted a Kansas City man who whipped his son to death
with a frayed belt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John J. Williams Jr., 30, could be sentenced later to up to life
in prison for felony second-degree murder and endangering a child. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His attorney will appeal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams' defense attorney argued that his client never intended
to kill 2-year-old Michael Scott when he disciplined the boy with a
braided, split belt. Prosecutors compared the beating to a flogging
with a cat-o'-nine-tails. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Prosecutor Claire McCaskill said the verdict
showed a public shift away from too much emphasis on parental
rights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't want to be convicted of murder for killing
their children they shouldn't beat them in the first place,'' she
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael attended the Operation Breakthrough day-care center. The
assistant director of the center, Sister Berta Sailer, testified at
the trial and applauded the verdict. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get the message across this will not be
tolerated,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jurors heard testimony that Williams beat Michael on May 29 last
year because the boy wet his pants. Minutes after the beating,
Michael stopped breathing, and Williams rushed him to a fire
station. Michael was dead, and the police investigated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams told police about the beating in a videotaped statement
played for the jury. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I stripped him from the waist down; I wanted him to feel it,''
Williams told police. As the boy screamed, Williams told him, ``If
you're going to make that noise at least drop a tear.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He called it ``a normal whipping'' _ about five blows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The beating caused a rare condition usually seen in industrial
accidents or car wrecks, a medical expert said. His flesh was
struck so hard that the fat turned to liquid and blocked his blood
vessels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The expert added that Michael would have died from internal
bleeding the beating caused in his thigh. The flesh was beaten off
Michael's thigh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jurors also heard testimony from Michael's 12-year-old half
brother. He testified that he heard the smack of blows mixed with
Michael's screams for about 15 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said Williams had been beating Michael about every two
weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During closing argument's Wednesday, Dan Miller, assistant
prosecutor, popped the belt taut as he held it before jurors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you beat a dog with this?'' he asked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miller showed jurors pictures of Michael's injuries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like tire tracks going over that little boy,'' he
said. ``No man would do that unless it was his purpose.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Horton Lance countered that his client did not
take into account that one blow with the belt struck in many
places. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could have foreseen that his fat would liquefy,'' Lance
said. ``This was a tragic, unintentional accidental death.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fact that his client disciplined Michael before with the
belt also showed it was an accident, Lance said. ``This day, for
whatever reason, he went too far _ it was reckless.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lance argued that his client was guilty of no more than
involuntary manslaughter.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The jury went out at 3:50 p.m. Wednesday. As in many child
deaths, its verdict hinged largely on whether the defendant
intended to seriously injure or kill. Those elements are needed for
conventional second-degree murder, which carries a sentence of 10
years to life in prison. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers often argue for involuntary manslaughter, saying
the accused did not intend to kill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Involuntary manslaughter carries a top sentence of seven years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a rare legal move, Miller also charged Williams with felony
murder. That allows a murder verdict whenever someone dies during a
serious crime. Miller argued that Michael's death was felony murder
during child endangerment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only one appeals court has upheld that approach in one case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The jury reached a verdict at 11:30 a.m. Thursday. It did not
believe Williams intended to seriously injure or kill, jurors said
afterward, so they rejected the charge of conventional
second-degree murder and convicted him of felony second-degree
murder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, Kansas and 26 other states have passed recent laws
that allow sentences of up to life whenever a child dies by abuse,
intentional or not. But the Missouri law went into effect in August
1997, three months after Michael died. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charges of endangering the welfare of a child are pending
against Michael's mother, Deborah Blake. She allegedly did nothing
to stop the beating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael's half brother is in the care of an aunt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sailer, the assistant day care director, said Michael was a
happy boy who loved the Barney show and often sang its song. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The message he got from that show was so different from what
he got at home,'' she said. &QL;

MOURNERS SAY GOODBYE TO FIRST OF BLAST VICTIMS TO BE BURIED

<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. _ While rescue crews struggled to find the final
worker still missing after Monday's massive grain-elevator
explosion, mourners gathered to say goodbye to the first of the
blast victims to be buried. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people filled the chapel of the Resthaven Mortuary in
Wichita on Thursday afternoon for the funeral of Jose Luis Duarte,
40. Duarte, a Cuban immigrant who had worked at the elevator for
more than three years, was found dead Monday, shortly after the
explosion at the DeBruce Grain elevator complex southwest of
Wichita. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Father Leopoldo Gonzales told the mourners that no one can
understand why God takes people when he does, and why he takes some
who've lived a relatively short time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conducting the service in Spanish, Gonzales said, ``We are in
God's hands.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mourners streamed behind the hearse that carried Duarte's body
to the cemetery. His four small children _ Andy, Manual, Jaime and
Javelin _ walked at the front of the procession. Jaime carried a
cross of flowers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The death toll in the blast stands at five, and Duarte was the
first to be buried. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Duarte was laid to rest, rescue crews continued the difficult
search through the grain- and rubble-filled tunnel seeking the last
missing victim. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon Thursday, a spokesman for the Sedgwick County
Fire Department said the rescue work appeared to be nearing an
end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is that we're getting close,'' said Ken Cox,
the department's division chief. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration
was investigating the DeBruce Grain elevator for possible
violations of federal law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Marple, OSHA's Kansas director, said he and three other
inspectors had been conducting interviews with survivors and
examining pieces of equipment blown from the structure by the
explosion that was believed to have been caused by an accumulation
of grain dust. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The elevator had not undergone an OSHA examination since 1983,
Marple said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got elevators in Kansas that have never been
inspected,'' he said, estimating that there could be as many as
1,500 of them in the state. ``They are like trees in the forest.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said the elevator, purchased by DeBruce in 1996, had not been
the subject of complaints against the current owners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marple emphasized that his inspectors were taking a back seat to
the rescue teams that continued to focus their efforts on a
1,200-foot tunnel, one of four that run beneath the half-mile-long
grain storage facility southwest of Wichita. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three bodies already have been removed from the tunnel. They
have not been identified, although Cox said the county coroner was
making good progress toward identification. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Workers cut a hole through the thick ceiling of the concrete
tunnel to provide new access for a huge grain vacuum that will
speed the recovery. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in a rescue mode,'' Deputy fire chief Curtis
Wilson reported. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By early evening, Cox said, three crews were at work in the
section of the tunnel where the man was believed to be trapped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The crews are very optimistic now that we're making such good
progress,'' Cox said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tunnel is clogged with grain, concrete chunks from the
storage bins above and twisted pieces of the conveyor belt system
that transported grain through the complex. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the rescuers who worked to remove a 4-by-7-foot section
of the 15-inch thick ceiling was Jeff Gottbreht, a member of a
specially trained urban search and rescue team organized by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's based in Lincoln, Neb., where Gottbreht is a city
firefighter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His three-member team spent six hours cutting through the slab
with a water-cooled saw. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By about noon, it was loose, and Gottbreht and other crew
members rotated out for a 12-hour rest as they had since they
arrived early Tuesday morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As he squeezed water from his heavy clothing, Gottbreht talked
about what they might find. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of morbid, but even if we don't find and rescue a
live body, you are giving some closure to a family,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rescue teams were being housed in a nearby school. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A large bus, chartered from a company called ``Good Life
Coaches,'' brought the crew members back to the school for their
rest period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping accommodations were arranged in the school's
multipurpose room. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They make me sleep on the stage,'' Gottbreht said. ``I
snore.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team also has dogs trained to detect human scent and they
have been working all week in the tunnel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One crew member sat on the school steps petting a mixed-breed
dog named Ditto. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the best in the country,'' the crew member said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five men still are hospitalized from blast injuries and their
conditions remained unchanged. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those hospitalized: Lanny Owen, critical condition; Scott
Mosteller, serious; Johnny Sutton, upgraded to serious from
critical; Daryl Williams, critical; and Carlos Amador, fair. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Authorities identified the men missing in the tunnel as Howard
Goin, Noel Najera, Victor M. Castaneda and Raymundo Diaz-Vela. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the dead, only the two victims found Monday _ Duarte and Jose
Prajedes Ortiz, 24 _ had been identified.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early on in the disaster, local hospitals had feared they would
face a shortage of blood. But donors crowded the American Red Cross
Wichita office this week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officials asked people to send cards to survivors, rescuers and
families who are mourning those who died. Cards can be sent to
``Families and victims of DeBruce Grain Elevator explosion, c//o
American Red Cross, 707 N. Main St., Wichita, Kan. 67203. &QL;

<P>
   Flight attendants of Trans World Airlines may stop working on
the carrier's Boeing 757s next month if the two sides fail to reach
an agreement on staffing and safety issues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The head of Machinists Local 1997, which represents TWA's 4,900
flight attendants, said talks to establish staffing guidelines
regarding the 190-seat jet so far had failed. The Boeing 757 was
introduced into TWA's fleet about 18 months ago, and management and
the union must incorporate any new aircraft into its current
bargaining agreement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As of July 1, you will no longer be obligated to fly the
757,'' said Sherry Cooper, president of Local 1997, in a recorded
phone message to members. ``Our primary concern is safety.
Additional issues include understaffing penalty pay and the type of
service to be performed on the 757.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said the union was continuing to hold talks with TWA on
the 757. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TWA has 15 of the 757s in its fleet of 185 aircraft. The company
said it thought an agreement would be reached with the flight
attendants before next month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, we don't anticipate a service disruption,''
said TWA spokesman Jim Brown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the talks about the 757 are separate from the main
negotiations occurring now between TWA and all of its unionized
work force on a new contract. The latest contract expired last
August but remains in effect during negotiations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TWA's discussions with the Machinists union and Air Line Pilots
Association have dragged along, frustrating many in the work force.
Last month, many TWA workers engaged in a work slowdown for two
hours at TWA's St. Louis hub, causing flight delays and
cancellations. &QL;

YOU'LL NEVER LOOK AT COWS THE SAME WAY AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If only we could have had this book on those long family trips
in the station wagon instead of that boring magnetic tack-toe
board!
</P>
<P>
   ``A Field Guide to Cows: How to Identify and Appreciate
America's 52 Breeds,'' by John Pukite, is modeled humorously on
birding guides. But instead of classifying herons, the book takes
on heifers _ offering comprehensive profiles on breeds, clothing
and equipment suggestions, viewing tips, glossary, charts, and
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Pukite, a biologist, wrote the book almost on a whim. ``I didn't
really have a strong opinion about cows before,'' he says, by phone
from Minnesota. ``I just mooed at them like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he was struck by the number and variety of cows he
encountered as he drove from Minnesota to Seattle on a trip.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The book has caught on so well _ with close to a whopping
50,000 &UR;  &LR; in print _ that Pukite laughs when he recalls he initially
thought he'd have to pay to have it self-published. &UR;  &LR; In fact, ``A
Field Guide to Cows'' is so hot that his publisher, Penguin (of
course), wants more &UR;  &LR; guides like it. And naturally, pigs, sheep,
and goats are next for this barnyard Roger Tory Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Packed with facts both serious and silly, the cow guide can keep
travelers busy long past that first whiff of manure.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine yourself driving along. ``What are those black-and-white
cows out there?'' someone asks.
</P>
<P>
   With your handy guide, you can be a bovine Einstein. You'll see
that the animal's wedge-shaped outline tells you it's a dairy cow
(beef cows are more rectangular). And the conformation of the spots
reveals that these cows are Holsteins _ the No. 1 dairy cow (most
numerous and produces the most milk) in America.
</P>
<P>
   What if you encounter something more exotic? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   That huge cow with the massive horns? Is it a Texas Longhorn?
No! Pukite tells us it is the Watusi from Africa, the cow that has
the biggest horns of any breed (often 8 feet long and 8 inches
around at the base).
</P>
<P>
   If you have to stop the car for a better look in identifying a
breed, Pukite has a few cautionary words, listed under ``Cow
Etiquette'': ``Cows have almost total 360-degree panoramic vision,
making them tough to sneak up on.'' Approach them slowly, without
sudden movements or loud noises. Also, try to keep your own mooing
in check. Mooing is a reflexive human reaction to cows, but since
it can signal distress or the ``feed me'' lament of a calf, you
shouldn't overdo it.
</P>
<P>
   How serious is Pukite about all this? The book is a
pungent &UR;  &LR; mixture of parody and information. And so is the author's
general view of cows. On a recent trip to Hawaii, Pukite realized
he may have a secondary profession as a leader not of birding, but
cowing, trips in paradise. No kidding. ``There are cows all around
the island!'' he exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   Pukite's enthusiasm for cows ensures that you will never look at
them in the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   He can make cows sound wholesome: The Jersey has a ``cute
appearance,'' ``a gentle nature,'' ``intelligence,'' and it makes a
great ``family cow.''
</P>
<P>
   He can make cows sound sexy: The Chianina, he says, is
``shapely.'' The breed Blonde d'Aquitaine, the full-figure girl of
bovines, is described as having ``curving horns'' and ``a long,
straight topline,'' and it is ``the largest and heaviest of the
French breeds.'' The British White has, quite bluntly, ``big
udders.'' And the Piedmont sports a ``big, beefy butt.''
</P>
<P>
   And he can be downright racy: American farmers, he writes, take
advantage of the Simmental's ``latent dairy traits in
crossbreeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Cows can be macho, according to Pukite: The breed Salers (for
this breed, the cows don't moo, they coo ``Hey there, Salers, new
in town?'') is described as ``a big, burly, cherry red cow.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pukite's world, cows can even be dignified: The Charolais is
``one of the oldest and most respected of the French breeds.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Limousin, ``the long, sleek cow'' from France, sounds as
if it should be called a ``stretch Limousin,'' since it is noted
for both power and speed. (The Limousin may very well be the cow
depicted in the famous Lascaux cave drawings.)
</P>
<P>
   Cows are everywhere _ there are 100 million of them in the
United States alone _ and it's a shame that so many of us pass them
by without appreciating their bovine beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Let John Pukite show you the whey.

MEDDLING IS TO BLAME IN ASIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent analysis of Asia's woe suggests that its economic
miracle and its subsequent crisis are opposite sides of the same
coin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arthur J. Alexander, president of the Japan Economic Institute,
points out that the countries with the biggest problems share
significant economic development philosophies. The most significant
of these is an emphasis on government intervention in banking and
credit activities designed to mobilize savings and channel them
into favored investment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alexander says such intervention on a modest scale doesn't
appear to hurt growth. If, however, the favored projects aren't
pursued strictly for profitability, the stage is set for future
troubles. When an investment's soundness is questionable, the usual
practice is for governments to protect investors from risk with
guarantees against loss. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This creates what economists call ``moral hazard,'' which is
what Alexander says has been ``the primary cause of today's crises
in East Asia.'' Moral hazard is basically an insurance term used to
explain how imprudent or dishonest behavior is encouraged when
people are protected from the adverse consequences of their
actions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive government involvement in capital formation and
allocation was obviously an early dynamic spur to economic growth
in such countries as Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia.
Over time, though, moral hazard led to questionable policies and
unsound investments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As is usually the case, government socialized the losses and
privatized the profits. If loans weren't repaid, government rescued
lenders and depositors. If the loans proved profitable, bank owners
pocketed the profits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to note that not all the Asia ``tigers'' have
come to grief. Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore remain stable,
Alexander points out, most likely because they are subject to
rigorous bank supervision and have capital markets providing access
to long-term financing through other means than bank loans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's analysis is useful in the debate over what many
perceive as inadequate savings by Americans. The Asian countries in
the most trouble all shared remarkably high savings rates. Much of
the savings was wasted, however, because ill-advised government
policies encouraged unsound investment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Asian debacle thus proves that savings in and of itself
can't ensure prosperity. What's needed is sound accompanying policy
directing savings toward their highest and best use when
transformed into the wealth-creating investments necessary for
prosperous growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the Japanese, for instance, are renowned for their thrift,
their rewards are the most humongous banking problem in history, an
anti-consumer economy, and political and economic systems in
tightening gridlock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the problem, beyond bad resource-allocation
policies, is the anti-consumer nature of economic policy. In trying
to build economies on exports, the workers making the prosperity
possible are denied the full fruit of their labor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Asia is to regain its dynamism, market-disciplined financial
systems must be complemented by consumption-oriented economies. The
U.S. miracle is the enduring real deal it is because it creates
ample rewards for the working-class folk who make it possible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Asia miracle is vaporizing because economic policy has been
geared to reward the ruling elite while shortchanging the masses. &QL;

DEAR `BRIDGET JONES' DIARY': GET REAL! 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 14) 
(jt) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bridget Jones makes me ill. She gives me a headache; she makes
my stomach hurt and my heart heavy.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't heard of ``Bridget Jones' Diary'' ... well, good
for you. The novel, a best seller in England, tells the story of a
single woman in her 30s who works in publishing with a degree of
passion that can best be described as dead-eyed apathy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones tells her tale in the form of a diary, noting at each
entry her weight, the number of aborted phone calls made to former
and potential lovers, cigarettes smoked, calories and snack foods
and alcoholic drinks consumed. She agonizes over why men mistreat
her, how they're self-absorbed and emotionally stunted, then spends
hours gazing wistfully at the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Perfectly normal behavior, if you're a 13-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   The book transformed its author, Helen Fielding, into a
celebrity in England, and almost every women's magazine in America,
from Vogue to Mirabella to Jane, praised it upon its publication
here by Viking. Many women are apparently laughing as they
recognize parts of themselves in Bridget's jumble of insecurities
(just as they smile knowingly along with Ally McBeal).
</P>
<P>
   Bridget's universe is populated by couples she calls Smug
Marrieds and single friends she calls Singletons. Ambivalent as
Bridget is about marriage _ those who achieve it immediately turn
into self-satisfied boors _ she leaves no doubt about the single
state: the unattached woman is a simpleton, a spinster, someone
worthy of a derogatory label. The plot is simple: she is on a quest
for a man who returns her phone calls, and she'd like to lose eight
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   After a member of the publicity brigade that is trumpeting the
book called and urged me to read it, I decided to see what the fuss
was about. It doesn't take a Freudian analyst to know that the
cover is a tip-off that something is terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of enthusiastically mascaraed eyes look up expectantly; a
mouth frosted in lipstick is poised into the open ``o'' that
appears in sexually suggestive advertising. (There's no nose. Who
needs a nose?) Most disturbing is the foundation upon which this
disembodied woman's face is presented: blank pages, the red and
blue lines of a child's notebook, unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And through it all,'' the jacket reads, ``Bridget will have
you helpless with laughter and shouting, `Bridget Jones is me!'''
</P>
<P>
   Nah. I started reading and couldn't stop, through all 271
stomach-churning pages. It was like stumbling across open-heart
surgery on the Learning Channel _ appalling, but hard to turn away
from.
</P>
<P>
   The thing reads like a novelization of the Calvin Klein perfume
commercial for Contradiction, in which the model Christy Turlington
talks about what a mess of conflicting emotions she is as she
stares stormily into the camera, then laughs a shade too
hysterically, then weeps a little, then smiles coyly, then averts
her gaze moodily.
</P>
<P>
   That's what ``Bridget Jones' Diary'' is about: the learned
helplessness thrust upon women by advertisers, popular
entertainment and, yes, women's magazines. Ms. Fielding constructs
her heroine out of every myth that has ever sprung from the ground
of Cosmopolitan and television sitcoms. To wit, that men are, in
the words of one character, ``stupid, smug, arrogant, manipulative
and self-indulgent''; that women are obsessed with boyfriends,
diets and body hair, and that every emotional reversal is cause for
a chocolate binge.
</P>
<P>
   It makes humor out of the premise that being neurotic is cute.
That women eat too much. That we succumb to the lure of too many
cocktails. That if we don't enjoy our jobs, we just stick around
and, heck, sleep with the boss (who never calls us back).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I was taking the whole thing way too seriously. I decided
to survey some female acquaintances, to see if I was, in fact, a
harridan with no sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   But I wasn't alone. Others, smart New Yorkers all, shared my
antipathy for Bridget. ``She's a self-contained, one-woman mental
institution,'' said Joanie McDonell, a writer. Candace Bushnell,
whose sometimes lonely but mostly confident female characters
inspired the new HBO series ``Sex and the City,'' said she thought
``Bridget Jones' Diary'' was fun to read, but 10 years out of date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the kind of thing that would have been written
here in the '80s,'' she said. ``Now, in Manhattan, if you're over
35 and you're not married, frankly it's not a big deal. People say
you're lucky and don't bother. But in England if you're 30 and
you're not married, it's totally weird. It says more about the
state of feminism in England.''
</P>
<P>
   Giulia Melucci, who handles book publicity for Scribner, was one
of the few I surveyed who argued that the novel was a realistic
look at single female life. ``Haven't you ever had a day where you
spent two hours looking for pantyhose and couldn't find any?'' she
asked. Sure, but a new pair of pantyhose costs $5 at the corner
drugstore. That shouldn't be the price of self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   I called an author who has written extensively on the status of
single women today, Marcelle Clements, who wrote ``The Improvised
Woman: Single Women Reinventing Single Life.'' She said the book
disturbed her on so many levels she couldn't begin to count. ``It's
the humor of the pathetic,'' she said. ``It's as if as women become
more successful and powerful, they need to be punished for defying
the old laws. They have to be with their nose in the Haagen-Dazs;
they have to be made to look ridiculous and pitiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Overheated, perhaps, but I see her point.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes, I know ``Bridget Jones'' is satire, a sassy spoof of
urban manners. But Bridget is such a sorry spectacle, wallowing in
her man-crazed helplessness, that her foolishness cannot be
excused.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend _ a Smug Married _ noted that although men suffer
from similar, and maybe even more toxic, neuroses and fears, ``men
always burnish their images.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their images are always much glossier and better than
reality,'' she said. ``Women don't do that. Society wants the woman
to be self-deprecating.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the book, Bridget is carried away by an
inscrutable character who has magically metamorphosed from the dull
boor he was for the first 250 pages into a dashing knight, sweeping
her out of her family's dysfunctional home on Christmas Day. The
pair have never even been on a date, but she gamely joins him in a
hotel suite where he makes love to her on _ someone call Barbara
Cartland! Her material is being ripped off! _ a four-poster bed.
She is surrounded by the trappings of long-sought material comfort,
secure in the arms of the faceless Prince Charming who has saved
her day.
</P>

HEED ORWELL'S WARNING ON THE DEGENERATION OF LANGUAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fascinating exhibit about Boston is in Cambridge at the
Compton Gallery of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Norman B. Leventhal of MIT's class of 1938 is displaying, until
July 31, ``Mapping Boston: Delineating the City and its Region.''
Leventhal, who has collected Boston maps for years, has displayed
these elegant parchments chronologically, from the 17th to the 20th
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Perusing a 19th-century map at the exhibit's opening was John R.
Silber, former president of Boston University, former gubernatorial
candidate, and full-time contrarian. With a mischievous gleam in
his eye, Silber muttered, ``My, my, these are wetlands. If we had
saved the wetlands, there would be no Back Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since ``nature'' became ``the environment,'' its dominant
language has elided from euphemism to propaganda to Holy Writ. In
the 19th century, city builders called it a noxious swamp, a
malarious marsh, or a fetid fens (adios, Fenway Park, if today's
bureaucrats had made the call). ``Wetlands'' conjures up Rousseau's
peaceable-kingdom purity, which is why it soberly infests state and
federal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   When language evolves into propaganda, George Orwell warned, the
result is totalitarianism. After he issued that warning in 1946,
Soviet Russia created ``The People's Republics'' of Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, and so on. Winston Churchill's skill at the English
language properly described this conquest as imposing ``an iron
curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   The replacement of ``swamp'' by ``wetlands'' is a more benign
evolution of language, just as ``jungle'' has been eclipsed by
``rainforest,'' although Edgar Rice Burroughs did not write a novel
about, nor did Johnny Weismuller portray in movies, ``Tarzan, Lord
of the Rainforest.''
</P>
<P>
   Orwell pointed out that most degradations of grammar and
language have political motives. Thus, in self-defense, people now
study words and consult language mavens, a concise Yiddishism in
itself. Jesse Sheidlower has been studying language at Random House
for years and has published ``Jesse's Word of the Day,'' an
alphabetized compilation of answers to inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   The American language, H.L. Mencken declared more than 60 years
ago, is constantly evolving, but many regionalisms resist
homogenizing. Sheidlower notes that ``moxie,'' for instance,
appeared in a 1930 Damon Runyon short story, and asserts that the
phrase derives from ``Moxie, the trademark name of a popular soft
drink marketed especially in New England. Moxie is thus a sort of
`Pepsi spirit' of the 1930s, if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   No, we won't, because ``if you will'' is a stalling-tactic
phrase, a tangle of overbearing linguistic kudzu. Sheidlower is
more useful in rolling out a ``juggernaut,'' determining the
ancestry of ``nerd'' (Dr. Seuss), and giving due deference to the
Dutch phrases, ``booze'' and ``kit and caboodle.'' He also
forthrightly admits defeat: ``The ultimate origin of `eighty-six'
is unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   He details the Greek and Latin origins of ``onomatopoeia,'' a
favorite linguistic tool of today's bureaucrats, who know that
``wetlands'' sounds better than ``swamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Leventhal's marvelous maps narrate the saga of how
civilization arrived in Boston and how the city subdued its
environment, which included weather, a nonsacred shoreline, and
fetid swamps. The manmade beauty of today's cities might not have
survived a multi-volume environmental impact report.
</P>
<P>
   Much of today's enviro-bureaucratic language caters to
air-conditioned troglodytes who have their pie and refuse to share
it. The first, not last, refuge of litigious scoundrels is often
``traffic and parking.'' But a city without ``traffic and parking''
problems is a dead city. Those who can't handle the byproducts of
density should move far away, perhaps to a quiet, peaceful spot
amid federally protected ``wetlands.''

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After hundreds of troops and police marched into a
Zapatista rebel village Wednesday and sparked a deadly gun battle,
Mexican human rights groups fear the government will provoke an
all-out war now against the Maya Indian dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's violence marked the first time Zapatistas and the
Mexican military have directly exchanged gunfire in more than four
years of uneasy truce and mounting tension in Chiapas, a state on
Mexico's southern border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are back where this all started in January 1994,'' said
Pablo Romo of Chiapas' Fray Bartolome de las Casas Human Rights
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the government is trying to pave the way for a
direct confrontation with the Zapatista Army,'' Romo said, calling
``peace the loser.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined a chorus of voices that are criticizing the government
for failing to promote peace talks in Chiapas and adopting an
aggressive military policy toward the Zapatistas, with whom the
government officially has a truce.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative and left-wing opposition parties also attacked the
government this week, calling for an investigation into how the
military's attempt to enter El Bosque, a village sympathetic to the
Zapatistas, flared into a deadly confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government had better be absolutely open,'' said Felipe
Calderon, president of the conservative National Action Party
(PAN). ``If its intention is to end the truce that has held since
1994, considering it to be useless and not viable, then it must say
so and bear the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The military's attempt to occupy El Bosque came less than a week
after Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz _ a key figure in Chiapas _
resigned in frustration from a mediation commission that helped
forge the truce between the government and the Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican troops and police were sent into El Bosque after a
reported ambush on Tuesday killed a sympathizer of Mexico's
dominant political party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party
(PRI). On Wednesday a column of 500 heavily armed troops and state
police were sent marching into the village in an attempt to occupy
it by force.
</P>
<P>
   The troops said they were fired on and then lobbed tear gas, and
began firing their weapons, killing eight Zapatista sympathizers
and sending other villagers fleeing into thickly forested hills.
Survivors of the confrontation said the military fired on the
village first.
</P>
<P>
   For several months now, the Mexican military has been marching
into Zapatista villages in an aggressive law-and-order campaign,
dismantling some of the more than 30 parallel or so-called
``autonomous'' governments that Zapatistas have set up in villages
scattered about the state.
</P>
<P>
   The policy began around the same time that the government began
expelling foreign human rights observers it charged were violating
Mexican immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Critics see the policy as a concerted effort to break the truce,
roust the Zapatistas and undermine rebel support among Indian
towns. Human rights groups, including the government's own National
Human Rights Commission, have urged that the military be withdrawn
from areas of conflict because they are hindering peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations now seem to be completely blocked on the national
level,'' said Jose del Val of the Inter-American Indigenous
Institute in Mexico City. He suggested that only international
pressure could help push the government and the Zapatistas back to
the table to talk peace.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's gun battle in Chiapas was significant enough to
prompt Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo to comment publicly on the
incident during a trip to Chiapas, where he met with presidents of
local municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks Friday, Zedillo lamented the violence in El Bosque,
but said ``the best protection against violence is to comply with
the law, respect each other, whether we agree with each other or
not, and practice tolerance as we pursue dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to resolve the conflict in Chiapas, Zedillo has
been pushing for the passage of reforms in Mexico's Congress that
are designed to expand Indian rights.
</P>
<P>
   An administration source said Zedillo is ``dedicated to
dialogue,'' but the government must enforce ``the rule of law'' and
use the military to stop arms trafficking in the region and
violence from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was not a strike against the Zapatista Army,''
the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas, who enjoy sympathy among many Mexicans, staged
their first attack on the government in January 1994, claiming that
native Maya Indians were suffering from crushing poverty, disease
and brutal treatment by a corrupt government.
</P>
<P>
   Although peace accords were eventually signed, talks between the
government and the rebels broke down and the accords were never
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Zapatistas have set up their own village
governments and pursued their cause mostly by seeking support from
sympathizers in the rest of Mexico and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The shoot-out between Zapatistas and the military in Chiapas
Wednesday occurred on the heels of another event this week that
shocked Mexicans _ a military assault last Sunday on the Popular
Revolutionary Army (EPR), a second rebel group that has attracted
sympathy among impoverished Mixteco Indians living in Mexico's
Guerrero state.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes in Chiapas and Guerrero this week are unrelated, but
have contributed to a climate of fear that more violent
confrontations between the military and underground rebel groups
are likely to occur in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The EPR, for its part, has issued a communique stating that for
each of the 12 sympathizers killed in Guerrero last Sunday it will
kill 10 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Chiapas, human rights observers and analysts
believe the government has opened a new chapter this week in its
relationship with the Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an `Internet war' anymore,'' political analyst Sergio
Sarmiento wrote in the Mexico City newspaper Reforma, referring to
the peaceful, almost playful way Zapatista rebels and sympathizers
have used the Internet to boost international support for their
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Sarmiento castigated the government and rebel leadership for
failing to negotiate an end to the crisis in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this conflict, as in all, the victims are not the
protagonists,'' he said. ``Neither Subcommander Marcos (spokesman
for the Zapatistas) nor high government officials lose anything
because peace has not been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who offer their lives are the soldiers and the
guerrillas,'' he said, ``and those who pay are the peasants, with
their deteriorating standard of living and the economic and
physical insecurity that today rules Chiapas.''

 &HT;    No space to garden? Can't stand the work? Want to dress up your
porch or patio? Hey,...contain yourself
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If your idea of gardening is planting a couple of nice-looking
pots on the porch, give yourself a gold star. You've become a true
gardener.
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's a real science to designing and
assembling an attractive and effective container garden. Don't let
anyone tell you it's just potluck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like baking a cake,'' said Alison Dembo, assistant
retail manager for Habersham Gardens. Leave out a key ingredient or
forget a crucial step, and you risk a real flop.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never experimented with pots, consider what more and
more garden addicts are discovering: Containers allow you to create
a low-maintenance garden in a small space, to move the color of a
garden close to the house or into the shade, and to experiment with
a wide variety of plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're especially nice for people who live in the city,''
Dembo said.
</P>
<P>
   The planting options, including shrubs and even small trees, are
endless. ``Basically, any plant can be grown in a container if
you're willing to water, fertilize and acclimate the pot to a
location,'' Dembo said.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're willing to pay the price, you can create an
established garden from the get-go by packing it with mature
plants. ``The goal is to do something that looks pretty from the
beginning and will grow into something beautiful over the course of
the summer,'' said Sylvia Attkisson, an Atlanta garden designer.
</P>
<P>
   Before stirring up a pot, here are the main ingredients you'll
need:
</P>
<P>
   -- Proper container material. ``There are so many whimsical
things out now, you can use almost anything for a container,''
Dembo said, from rustic troughs to old boots.
</P>
<P>
   Terra cotta, by far, is the most popular material. Because it's
porous, it can absorb water, maintaining moisture longer, and
assume the mossy look so popular today. For year-round containers,
avoid Mexican terra cotta, Dembo said, because it's prone to
cracking during freezes. French or Italian terra cotta, concrete,
fiberglass and plastic are wiser choices.
</P>
<P>
   -- Location, location, location. The amount of sun or shade in
the place where you plan to put the pot will determine your plant
choices.
</P>
<P>
   -- A variety of plants _ verticals, trailers and fillers. Also
aim for a mix of heights; leaf sizes, shapes and textures; and
complementary colors in blooms and foliage.
</P>
<P>
   For height, consider cannas; ornamental grasses; shrubs,
including roses; and small trees, such as cherry laurels and
Japanese magnolias. Edge the pot with trailing plants such as
verbena, petunias, lantana, plectranthus, ivy, variegated vinca or
trailing zinnia (Zinnia angustifolia). Then fill in with
medium-size plants _ penta, plumbago, caladiums, coleus, impatiens,
ferns, hostas, small roses, hydrangeas.
</P>
<P>
   -- Decoration. Accent the pot as you would a garden. Add an
ornament, such as metal sculpture, an obelisk or even a trellis for
growing clematis, roses or Carolina jessamine.
</P>
<P>
   You were planning to decorate that cake, weren't you?

 &HT;    COLUMN: Grand gardenia perfumes gardens and memories
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gardenia. I love the sound of the word. Some lyricist did too,
as I recall, writing of a ``blue gardenia.'' Never have I seen any
but white ones. White, like the color of snow, like the color of
whiteouts and killer glaciers. Deathly, ghostly white. But
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   And sad, somehow. Why sad, I don't know for sure. I do think
that Billie Holiday is one reason. She, with her gardenia behind
her ear, she of the sadly beautiful songs _ ``... ain't nobody's
business if I do ... strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
... lover man, where can you beeeeee ...'' _ she of the tragic
life, she has to be one of the reasons the gardenia for some evokes
tragedy, she of the wasted death.
</P>
<P>
   Death, yes, that sweetness associated with funeral flowers. That
makes some dislike _ fear? _ gardenia. These are those who have sat
too many times without air conditioning in country churches,
fanning themselves during hot afternoon funerals, listening to the
haunting songs _ ``... swing low, sweet chariot ...'' _ staring at
the casket up front seemingly afloat in sweet lilies and tuberoses
and ... gardenias.
</P>
<P>
   I have sat in too many of those churches, but I am not in that
number. I still love the flower. Always have. Always will.
</P>
<P>
   And now that the gardenia is in its high bloom season, I am in
high cotton, enjoying its fragrance as it transports me back, back
in time to sweet, hot Southern nights when the flower perfumed the
air of Meridian, Miss., and infused my youth with its richness.
Enjoying its fragrance takes me forward, too, forward to the time
when my small gardenia bushes, scattered around my gardens in
Atlanta and McCaysville, Georgia, will reach the enviable heights
that I see in so many older spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Even with my smallish bushes, I coax enough blooms to keep one
in the house throughout the season. My best producer is one I
brought inside for the winter, one that now blooms more than all
the rest combined. Together, my several gardenias may have a
half-dozen blossoms at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   But how many do you need? Just one of these lovelies lights a
home _ even after it begins to brown and dry. If I have just two
blooms, one comes inside.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Wallace, friend and neighbor, understands. Sitting in her
garden the other day, her gardenia showing off with more than a
dozen perfect blossoms, we talked about our love for this sweet
thing.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the gardenia is a metaphor for the garden that Kay
is lovingly building. A frequent traveler, she lingers at her
gardenia on each return. And while away, she telephones her sister,
Alexis Barrett, to ask about its condition. ``She gives me the blow
by blow. She'll say, `You've got lots of buds.'''
</P>
<P>
   That sustains Kay until she returns to see and smell and touch
and cut.
</P>
<P>
   Her gardenia love began in childhood back in her native
Tuscaloosa, Ala., where she recalls smelling the blossoms in the
gardens of older women.
</P>
<P>
   She loves gardenia more now than yesteryear, associating them
with Billie, of course, ``and with anticipation,'' noting the
pregnant elegance of the about-to-open bud, white, tinged with
green, noting too that it recalls ``a past that we won't ever have
again.''
</P>
<P>
   What else, I ask, does this flower mean? What does it evoke?
</P>
<P>
   ``That you can write about?'' she said, meaningfully.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't nobody's business ...

 &HT;    `Truman' director Weir gives insight into comedy-drama
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 14: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Atlanta, Australian director Peter Weir
shared a few thoughts on his hit film, the comedy-drama ``The
Truman Show,'' starring Jim Carrey as a man who realizes his entire
life has been a TV show and everyone he knows is an actor.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Among the many interesting ideas in this movie is the notion
of one man's life as public commodity. That certainly reverberates
with our culture of celebrity and gossip, and the way people are
forced to live in fishbowls.
</P>
<P>
   A:It's extraordinary, the way it's accelerated in the last five
years. Last year, during the cutting period, the horror of
(Princess) Diana's death caused you to realize that even if you
hadn't bought all those magazines, you couldn't get away from it.
Just going to the local store, you'd see her on the magazine cover
with whatever her latest episode was _ as if it were a soap opera
with a spectacular end episode: the death of a princess.
</P>
<P>
   So it was interesting to me to have the audience cut into ``The
Truman Show,'' to see their reactions, and then their shock toward
the end. It was only then that they began to think, this man might
die. There was a reality here that had not been acknowledged, which
was the whole lie of his existence and his dreadful exploitation.
You were reminded, that was Diana. We're the very people who had
bought all the magazines and newspapers, who were very angry with
the paparazzi. But they were working for us. There were so many
ironies there.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You're right, Diana was like a long-running character in our
lives since we first heard of her.
</P>
<P>
   A:Even the Gulf War I think had that quality because of the
curious nature of the images we were seeing from gun cameras and so
forth. It was like a strange game. The idea that people were being
killed was pretty remote. It was a world event. We were all
watching, and (Gulf War commander Norman) Schwarzkopf became the
star of that. It was like a successful war series. Then came the
O.J. trial.
</P>
<P>
   Q:So considering how media-ized we are, ``The Truman Show''
isn't such a big jump.
</P>
<P>
   A:That's also why the town was photographed the way it was, and
the clothing very carefully thought about. It's all stylized, the
best of '30s and '40s clothing. So (Christof, the producer, played
by Ed Harris in the film) is also trying to teach the world a
better way to be, which is part of his vanity.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What about this story resonated with you?
</P>
<P>
   A:It seemed to be a totally fresh story, with old elements
combined in a very new way. You can't really come up with new
emotions. ... Someone said to me the other day, ``It's a really
strange film.'' And I said, ``No, it isn't.'' The emotional strands
are very traditional: love, the search for truth, the search for
freedom. But the context is bizarre. It's the times we're living
with. That's its newness as a film. It's one of the first films to
deal extensively with the rapid change in information technology
essentially, and the disturbance to our concept of the difference
between what is real and unreal.
</P>
<P>
   Q:It must have been a headache to the Paramount marketing
department.
</P>
<P>
   A:Yes, it's almost impossible. ... To just roll it out among all
the summer films (without extensive word-of-mouth screenings) would
have made it an unfortunate question mark: ``What is that? Is it a
comedy? I hear it isn't.'' It would have gotten lost in a confusion
that would seem to be coming off the film itself.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Did you have any concern about restraining or modulating
Carrey's performance?
</P>
<P>
   A:Yes, but I didn't want to inhibit him. He was looking for
change. He felt that ``Liar Liar'' would be one step, and ``The
Truman Show'' would be the next one in terms of his constituency,
demonstrating a broader range than the farcical comedies.
</P>
<P>
   I'd had some experience with Robin Williams (in ``Dead Poets
Society''). But I don't want to get the reputation of being the man
who removes the comedy from comic actors. (``Truman'' screenwriter)
Andrew Niccol said, ``You'll become a sort of directorial
chiropractor for comics _ he sort of straightens them out and sends
them on. One price for tragedy, another price for a drama.'' But,
as with Robin, I didn't want to deny Jim's talent for humor.
Sometimes Jim would say, ``I think I could try this in a bigger
way.'' And I'd say, ``Great, it's only film.'' Every other time, it
was useful, but just as often it was too much. But the worst thing
in the world for an actor is to pretend that there are some rules
that the director knows and you have to confine yourself to it,
instead of saying, ``Who knows? We have the blueprint of the
script, we can always go back and shoot the scene as it's written.
But what if we try something else?'''
</P>
<P>
   Q:(The film was shot in Seaside, the planned development resort
city in the Florida panhandle) What time of year did you shoot?
</P>
<P>
   A:Just the turn of the year, winter, which is why we could get
the town.
</P>
<P>
   Q:It's a strange town. It does look like a nutty film set.
</P>
<P>
   A:Robert Davis, its developer, compares it to Bath, (England).
He says a resort town really benefits from a degree of
theatricality. You leave your more mundane world behind, including
your problems.

 &HT;    Veteran band takes care of details
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pleasures of 4HIM's ``Obvious'' are indeed obvious. There
are rich vocal harmonies and hook-laden songs, but they shouldn't
be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Much of contemporary Christian music has been taken over by a
youth movement, post-adolescent musicians who favor hyper-driven
tunes that yield more energy than actual musical skill.
</P>
<P>
   That's why ``Obvious'' is so refreshing. This veteran Christian
band takes care of the small details: well-written songs and smooth
harmonizing that makes a listener want to hum along. The approach
has netted the Daphne, Ala.-based group 21 No. 1 songs on Christian
radio, six Dove Awards and a Grammy Award nomination.
</P>
<P>
   4HIM is known for its blend of voices. The group combines the
vocal stylings of '70s supergroups such as Ambrosia and Chicago.
Those influences are obvious on songs such as the uptempo ``Voice
In The Wilderness'' and the bouncy ``Can't Get Past the Evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The album's music is a perfect complement to 4HIM's harmonizing.
The group has abandoned the ``wall of sound'' approach used on its
previous album for a more sparse, organic sound on ``Obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   The new style works. From the shimmering acoustic guitar opening
of ``Let the Lion Run Free'' to the muscular drumming throughout,
the sound of ``Obvious'' is sparkling, full of clever hooks and
tasteful musical touches.
</P>
<P>
   Another strong suit for ``Obvious'' is its variety. Most of the
songs are straight-ahead pop/rock, but on ``Who's at the Wheel,''
4HIM employs an urban R&AMP;B approach that works surprisingly well.

 &HT;    To become a priest: Four Roman Catholic men take holy orders in
a solemn ceremony
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--Below an immense white stone image of the crucified
Christ, four men lay prostrate on the cool hard floor of the
Cathedral of Christ the King last Saturday to dedicate their lives
to the Roman Catholic priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   Their prostration symbolized their unworthiness for office and
their dependence upon God.
</P>
<P>
   Each had been called by name:
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Barona.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael A. Castano-Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Victor A. Galier.
</P>
<P>
   Richard K. Tibbetts.
</P>
<P>
   All had been proclaimed worthy of the office by the Rev. David
Talley, the archdiocese's director of vocations.
</P>
<P>
   For Atlanta Archbishop John F. Donoghue, the ordination brought
back memories of his own on June 4, 1955. ``The ceremony in many
ways is the same as the ceremony I had,'' said Donoghue. ``I think
of my ordination every time I place hands on these young men.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Catholic ordination rite symbolizes the continuity
of the church. The hands of each new priest were anointed with oil
to signify the authority to handle the sacred vessels and
substances of the sacraments. And, each priest in attendance laid
hands on the heads of the ordination candidates, continuing the
unbroken chain of the priesthood going back hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-July, 11 new priests will have joined the ranks of the
Archdiocese of Atlanta, and 54 more men slated for service in the
archdiocese are in seminary. The number is significant at a time
when many dioceses suffer from a shortage of clergy.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Saturday's ordination reflected trends nationwide
in the priesthood _ increasing numbers of Hispanic priests and a
growing number of second-career priests. Of the four, only Galier
is under 30. Tibbetts, 55, has worked as a special education
teacher in high school, and Barona, 52, was vice president of an
import fashion company and worked in the finance department of
Grady Memorial Hospital. Castano, 34, who is from Colombia, worked
with Colombian Boy Scouts and the Red Cross, served a year in the
army and led missions to rural parts of Colombia.

 &HT;    Nashville's NASCAR Cafe sets blood to racin'
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 14: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nashville
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to go to Talladega or Daytona to wallow in the
sights and sounds of NASCAR racing. The mother of all venues is
sitting here on Lower Broadway, in the heart of the country music
district. And like a beer-drenched Hank Williams Jr. show, it's
loud, it's garish, and pure heaven for fans of the
Southern-born-and-bred motor sport.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's new NASCAR Cafe (the second of several planned
across the country) is the latest entry in the world of theme
restaurants. Like Planet Hollywood or the Hard Rock, it's a
combination restaurant-museum-arcade dedicated to one subject _ in
this case, NASCAR racing. Found in an old warehouse just a stone's
throw from Ryman Auditorium, historic home of the Grand Ole Opry,
this place is as subtle as the roar of a fuel-injected engine. From
the garish neon facade to the orange pimento cheese spilling out of
the Thunder Road Burger ($7.99), the spot is the same exercise in
excess that makes stock car racing so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Out front, Jeff Gordon's orange and blue Monte Carlo, dressed up
in DuPont decals, sits on the sidewalk beckoning tourists to pull
out their wallets and come inside. If that wasn't enough, a
loudspeaker spits out announcements like a carnival barker:
``Remember _ life's a race. The best times win.''
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, the race begins. Literally. The three-story
restaurant is designed like a track, with huge open lobby
surrounded by tiered balconies of dining tables, arcade racing
games and glass cases enclosing NASCAR memorabilia. In the center
of it all, a huge bar serves as the main pit stop, built on bright
blue, green and yellow oil drums. The whole thing is illuminated by
lights made out of racing helmets, suspended from the ceiling on
black cables that look like the bell cords at gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of this monument to motor sports sits Darrell
Waltrip's Budweiser Chevrolet. At the top of each hour, one of the
wait staff (dressed in a black and white official's uniform with a
microphone headset), climbs on a platform overlooking the scene and
waves a flag, unleashing a rumble not unlike seeing a movie in
Sensurround. TV monitors overhead light up with video of an actual
NASCAR race, with a thunderous noise that nearly shakes the salt
off your fries. Then the big moment: Waltrip's car starts rising on
a hydraulic lift, soaring higher and higher above the bar like a
carnival ride. Whew.
</P>
<P>
   In between races, there's plenty of food straight out of the
grandstand. Specialties include the Pit Pig Sandwich (pulled pork
barbecue for $7.99), Superclash Catfish (with fries and coleslaw
for $8.99), and Collision Chicken ($9.99). You can top off your
meal with dessert, such as Chocolate Fudge Tire cake, or one of a
dozen ``high octane'' drink concoctions, such as the Spark Plug
(Crown Royal and Pepsi) or the Kahluadega 500 (Kahlua and
cappuccino). When the race isn't on, you can dine to nonstop
country music videos, including Lee Greenwood's flag-saluting ``God
Bless the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   For the hard-core NASCAR enthusiast, there's plenty to gawk at.
One wall is dedicated to the first family of NASCAR, Mr. and Mrs.
Bill France Sr. You can check out racing outfits worn by Michael
Waltrip, Davey Allison, Rusty Waller and Bill Elliott. The Winston
Cup trophy is on display. You can have your picture made sitting in
Gordon's car. If that's not enough, $5 will get you a ride in the
Virtual Reality Race Simulator, a big metal box that tosses fans
around like they were strapped to the hood of a souped up Monte
Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the NASCAR Cafe is designed to appeal to the racing
crowd. If you're not into motor sports, you might find yourself a
bit lost as to what the ruckus is all about. And if you don't like
boisterous crowds or burgers, you might want to avoid it
altogether. But if you're into NASCAR, this can be one wild ride.

   UTAH-JAZZ _ CHICAGO _ The Utah Jazz are trying to remain upbeat
despite being one game from elimination. But even the Jazz must
believe overcoming something nobody has in the Finals, a 3-1
deficit, and doing it against the greatest dynasty in sports in the
past 30 years, the Chicago Bulls, is almost impossible. (D'Angelo,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   STODA-COLUMN _ Rodman has folded, spindled and mutilated the
Chicago Bulls' trust. He has twisted it, ripped it and mangled it.
He has mocked the Bulls from front office to head coach to
teammates. He is a narcissist and a clown. He is dangerous. But he
has not consumed the Bulls. In fact, Rodman has elevated them.

celebrity? ``Nothing,'' says Maynard. (George, Palm Beach Post)

   CHINA-PEASANTS _ GUO YUAN, China _ Gazing down over green rice
shoots that forever have been the Chinese peasant's sweaty handhold
on life, Zhan Hanjuin couldn't dismiss the broad grin that had
played across his face all afternoon. It was hard for him still to
believe he was standing atop his own new, two-story house with a
fish pond on the roof, a Volkswagen Santana in the garage, and a
six-foot-high air conditioner in the parlor. Just 25 years ago,
Zhan and his new bride shared a house with his parents, two
brothers and their families. They worked on a collective farm and
didn't have electricity, much less electronics like the television
and stereo ornamenting Zhan's year-old house. Zhan, 48, is a
top-of-the-line ``peasant.'' But millions of Chinese families have
pulled themselves out of exhausting poverty since land reform began
handing them control of China's rice paddies and grain fields in
the early 1980s. (Kunstel, Cox News Service).

   With PEASANTS-MAO _ SHAOSHAN, China _ The adobe house where Mao
Tse-tung grew up is a shrine not just to the father of communist
China, but to the spirit of the peasants who inspired and helped
him fight a revolution. Tan Ruiren's parents were among them, early
members of the Shaoshan peasants' movement that Mao was said to
have started in a small loft of that house in 1925 to help
burdened, dirt-poor peasants shape a new life. She still proudly
shows the photograph of herself and fellow workers meeting with
Chairman Mao when he returned to visit in 1959, after the
revolution had put the communists in power. Then, she was a young
mother and the cook of the collective farm where Mao ate. Now, Tan
runs her own hectic restaurant across the pond from Mao's house,
where she also sells Mao trinkets and gladly distributes every day
hundreds of copies of that 1959 photo that has brought her
celebrity. (Kunstel, Cox News Service).

   RUSSIA-BRIDES _ KRASNOYARSK, Russia _ In the world of lonely
hearts, Tatyana Denoshova's lament rings loud and often: ``It's
difficult to meet a real man here. Good men are already married and
if they are not already married, they are no good.'' In her case,
though, the desperation resonates with urgency. A 25-year-old
hospital nurse in this depressed Siberia city, Denoshova earns only
$40 a month and hasn't been paid since March. She says the men she
meets are similarly strapped, or sodden with vodka, or both. She
and thousands of other Russian women have turned to mail-order,
video and Internet-based matchmaking services seeking husbands _
preferably American or European men who will love them and take
them far away from the dead-end of today's Russia. (Holmes) MOVED

SOUTH KOREAN STOCKS TUMBLE A RECORD 8.1 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Investors stampeded out of the Korean stock market
Friday, sending it back down to the 11-year lows hit late last
month on worries about the pace of economic changes and potential
labor unrest.
</P>
<P>
   This time, fears that the Japanese yen's free fall would put
pressure on China to devalue its currency, the yuan, unnerved both
foreign and local owners of Korean stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The key market index fell 8.1 percent, to 302.09, the largest
plunge on record. The closing figure was the lowest since January
1987. Many investors pulled their money out of the market on rumors
that Tiger Management LLC, a New York investment fund headed by the
well-known manager Julian Robertson, had sold large quantities of
South Korean shares.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Robertson has built up his fund's holdings in
companies like SK Telecom, South Korea's largest mobile-phone
company, and he has led a group of foreign investors pushing for
greater shareholder rights in the country. Those efforts had
bolstered the confidence of local investors.
</P>
<P>
   But those investors apparently ignored Robertson's other recent
statements that the problems of several Asian countries are not yet
close to being resolved. In fact, Tiger Management has been selling
some, but not all, of its South Korean holdings recently, including
Friday, according to an executive in the financial industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Fraser Seitel, a spokesman for Tiger
Management, declined to comment on the firm's trading activities or
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding force driving down the market was the yen's
inability to regain its footing against the dollar after remarks
Thursday by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that were
interpreted by currency traders to mean Japan would get no help in
defending the yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major concern is no longer restructuring but currency,''
said Yoon Doo-young, chief strategist at Daewoo Securities in
Seoul. ``The yen has been depreciating far more rapidly than the
market anticipated recently, and that gives China more reason to
consider devaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   A weaker yen and a weaker yuan make Japanese and Chinese exports
cheaper and increase competition over the long run for the exports
of other Asian countries like South Korea, particularly since the
Korean currency, the won, has remained relatively stable.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Marvin, head of research at Jardine Fleming in
Seoul, said there was little reason for the won to fall. He pointed
to $35 billion held in reserve at the Bank of Korea, evidence of
the country's comeback from severe financial pressures and
indebtedness late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin also said concerns over the effects of the falling yen
were premature because it took considerable time for currency
fluctuations to have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Marvin said, while South Korea and Japan sell many of
the same products, they often cater to different segments of the
same market. Korean computer-chip manufacturers, for instance,
largely make basic chips, while their Japanese counterparts have
branched into specialized memory chips and the like.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Additionally, according to Japan's Ministry of Trade and
Industry, only 35 percent of Japan's exports are denominated in
yen, and most of those products go to Asia. The rest are largely
denominated in dollars, German marks and British pounds and, thus,
their prices are not adjusted unless the yen moves substantially
and over a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
   By some measures, however, the yen's weakness means some South
Korean industries are verging on losing their edge against Japanese
competitors, if they have not already done so.
</P>
<P>
   Korean steel companies lose their currency competitiveness
against Japanese steelmakers when the yen weakens to 9.5 won, and
South Korean electronics makers lose their currency edge when the
yen weakens to 10.5 won. The yen fell as low as 9 won Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having a very hard time,'' Yoon of Daewoo Securities
said. &QL;

 &HT;    Breaking up the Bulls? Not so fast
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The last dance?
</P>
<P>
   No chance.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen and Phil Jackson
when they start talking about the Chicago Bulls breaking up after
The NBA Finals. That trio has been all over the road when
addressing this subject.
</P>
<P>
   Every word has been calculated to set up two men to take the
fall if something does happen and they don't return _ Owner Jerry
Reinsdorf and Vice President Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, Pippen and Co. will end this surprisingly easy series
tonight against the Jazz for one reason: to see The Jerrys squirm
when they are presented with their sixth NBA championship trophy in
the '90s. That's why Jordan, when asked Thursday if this is the
final run, said: ``A lot of things can happen, and management has
to choose a direction in terms of where they want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Now who's wearing the Bull's-eye?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Pippen will be back next year. The biggest question
marks are Jackson and Dennis Rodman. Jackson started the whole
``Bulls Are Breaking Up'' phenomenon by saying this would be his
last contract. Then it was Pippen, who said he would never play for
the Bulls again, before he came back from his injury and played for
the Bulls again.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Jordan, who twisted the entire soap opera and said
if The Jerrys don't want Jackson back (something neither of them
said), then he'd never play for another coach.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Rodman who said ... nothing that's made any sense.
</P>
<P>
   The only one who can be believed is Jackson. At this time next
season, he'll be sitting cross-legged on a rock in North Dakota
meditating.
</P>
<P>
   But don't buy Pippen's latest threat. ``I don't have any
intention of coming back here next season, even though I stated a
couple of days ago that I would look to come back, but I think that
this is the last run for this club.''
</P>
<P>
   How's the vise feel now, Jerrys?
</P>
<P>
   Here's what will happen:
</P>
<P>
   Pippen will explore his options and find he can receive about
$15million a year for three years from the Suns or the Rockets. He
will sit on the best offer and talk to Jordan, who said about
Pippen on Thursday, ``The harmony between the two of us is
incomparable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will ride off to his ranch and the Bulls will appease
Jordan by allowing him to hand pick Jackson's successor. Forget
Iowa State coach and Krause buddy Tim Floyd. That would assure a
breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan will tell the Bulls he'll stay if somebody like current
assistant Jimmy Rodgers is given the job and he's offered another
$30 to $40million.
</P>
<P>
   Management goes back to Pippen and makes a one-year offer for
$20 to $25million. Pippen may or may not sign. Being the
front-runner for the Finals MVP, Pippen now holds the hammer. He's
looking for his big payday, despite being 32. He probably asks for
three years in the $60million range.
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan and Pippen back, the next decision is what to do
with Rodman. At times, the Bulls appear fed up with his act, but
then he comes back and dominates the fourth quarter of the most
important game of the season Wednesday and puts the Bulls on the
brink of another championship. He turns the second- best player of
the decade _ Karl Malone _ into a whimpering, whining crybaby who
is looking for every excuse not to take the ball to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Does Rodman's incredible resiliency on the floor make up for his
bizarre behavior? Perhaps. But the Bulls have another option to
fill the subordinate role of power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, a free agent, comes and plays for his golfing/gambling
buddy Jordan, takes whatever the rules allow, which will be
$1million at the most or about $327,000 and finally gets his ring,
something Barkley cherishes more than a late-night bar rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago would be the perfect fit for Barkley. The Rockets are
looking to dump their older players (they started with the Kevin
Willis trade) and Barkley could fill Rodman's role as the
rebellious rebounder. And Jordan would find another reason for
motivation: To win a ring for Barkley. After all, Jordan has been
saying all week his pet project this year was to win one for Scott
Burrell. Scott Burrell?
</P>
<P>
   And why would the Two Jerrys commit another $100 million to win
another title?
</P>
<P>
   How about a stay of execution?

   Pitcher Watkins heading to West Point after state tournament
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Wangrin
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DRIPPING SPRINGS, Texas _ In two weeks Zach Watkins will ship
out, bound for the banks of the Hudson River and ``Beast
Barracks,'' basic training for the plebes of the U.S. Military
Academy at West Point's bicentennial class of 2002. For the next
four years he'll play baseball and work his way through an
education worth an estimated $280,000 and toward the goal of
leaving as the type of strong-willed, hard-working success-driven
man he has seen West Point produce.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Watkins, a trim 49-year-old entrepreneur, was Class of '71.
He played guard on Army's football team _ former Texas Coach John
Mackovic was one of his freshman coaches _ and became an Airborne
Ranger and served his commitment in Germany and Italy. Then he
successfully started, and ultimately sold, a string of business so
now he can comfortably afford to do what he did Wednesday. That is
to sit in the visitors dugout at the Dripping Springs High School
baseball field and watch his son and teammates work out in
preparation for tonight's Class 3A state tournament game against
Iowa Park at Nelson Field.
</P>
<P>
   Zach, one of four members of the school's 156-member senior
class to earn an appointment to a military academy, plans to be an
airborne ranger, serve his commitment and start a business, just as
his father did. He'd love to fly. His vision isn't good enough to
be a military aviator, but he will major in aeronautical
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Already he does have a pretty fair knowledge of the physics of
flight, particularly one involving a horseshoe-stitched ball.
Velocity. Control. Movement. He has it all, as his 15-3 record
(nine straight wins), 1.30 earned run average and 1.6
strikeouts-per-innings-pitched ratio will attest, and he'll have
the ball in his hand to start tonight's semifinal game for the 24-6
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits spots. If I call for a breaking ball in the dirt, he
puts it there,'' junior catcher Mark Bomar said.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins has emerged as the ace for the senior-dominate Tigers,
whose six losses have been to playoff teams, including
Halletsville, which they could meet in the final if the Brahmas get
by Atlanta in the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom Hancock, effusive in his praise of assistants Rick
Eickenloff and Mark Schroeder and trainer ``Doc'' Ohnheiser in
keeping the Tigers consistent and injury free, has done something
he's never done in 29 years as a coach, including 12 at Austin High
and 14 at Travis _ keep the same lineup since the third game of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Hancock took over a Dripping Springs program that
was a 12-time district champion and had reached the state
tournament in 1984 (runner-up) and '96 (semifinal loser). Going on
what people had told him, he figured Watkins would be his No. 2
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron Beauford was No. 1 last year, but when you take him out of
center field it really hurts us defensively,'' Hancock said. ``And
the more I was around (Watkins), the more I saw his easygoing
attitude you need in a pitcher and the attitude that he always
wants the ball in his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins has been amply backed by the Tigers, who have averaged
7.5 runs per game in the playoffs. This season all nine batters in
the starting lineup hit at least .321, led by Rhett Eickenloff's
.483, and eight of them have an on- base percentage of .510 or
better. Defense has been a question, though. The Tigers average 2.1
errors per game.
</P>
<P>
   Not that a bad pitch or timely error will unhinge Watkins, whose
unflappability is as big an asset as a fastball that's reputed to
have been clocked in the high 80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably my biggest attribute,'' the 6-foot-2-inch,
195-pounder said. ``If things don't go my way 100 percent, I can
just shrug it off. I used to want to strike everyone out, do
everything in a game. But I've grown up a bit. At each higher
level, more and more you're not able to do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual to see him smile when he makes a bad pitch,''
Paul Watkins said. ``He'll smile _ and he'll know what to do next
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Father knows his son well, the seeds of which can be traced back
to one Friday night when Zach was about 5, when Paul Watkins came
home from a business trip at 10 p.m., suitcase in hand, and
encountered his son in the kitchen. ``He asked me, `Have you been
gone, Dad?' I'd been gone a week and he hadn't noticed. So I
decided I needed to spend more time at home,'' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   They began to do more things together. Father and son took
frequent trips back to West Point or wherever the Cadets were
playing on the road, and Zach got to go into the locker room and
meet the players and coaches. At the end of his sophomore year, he
told his father _ whom along with his mother, Judy, he considers
his best friends _ that he wanted to go to West Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a surprise to me he decided to go there,'' said
Paul, wearing an Army hat and an Army football T-shirt. ``I tried
to be careful not to push the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't press the issue,'' said Zach, who shares the same
cropped red hair and freckles as his father. (His teammates call
him `Sausage' because his freckled cheeks look like, well,
sausage.) ``I'd grown up hearing about it all my life, the prestige
of it and the success West Point men have all their life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a part of that.''

 &HT;    Five days, five jobs
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ After working five jobs in five days to
see how the other half earn their daily bread, I thought of the old
joke about the eager college grad's first day on the job when his
boss shoves a broom into his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I just spent four years in college,'' the young man
protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, that's right,'' apologizes the boss. ``Here, I'll
show you how.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to be shown everything. Even the one job I had some
experience at had changed. But even if I wasn't worth the powder to
blow me out the door, my brief stints at other jobs might help you
decide whether to try a different hamster wheel:
</P>
<P>
   Winn Dixie Bag Boy
</P>
<P>
   As a former Publix bag boy, I felt ready to hit the floor
running. Just to be on the safe side, George Okell, sales manager
of the Winn Dixie in Palm Beach Gardens, suggested I watch a
12-minute instructional tape. I did. And I learned that as a
``service associate,'' my job was to provide friendly service, bag
groceries and offer to take them to the car.
</P>
<P>
   Could anything be easier?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Bagging groceries in large paper bags would be much easier.
The big brown bags are certainly more convenient for the customer
than plastic bags, which have the thickness of butterfly wings. But
plastic bags are cheaper ($20 for 2,000) than paper bags ($20 for
500) and that's the way it is unless the customer requests paper
bags.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the 50-lb paper bags of yore. A good bag boy _ and I was
good _ could size up a customer's package-carrying capacity at a
glance and pack accordingly. If the customer were robust, I would
whip two layers of cans into a double bag, toss in cereal, Kleenex,
macaroni, tomatoes, bread and _ thwock _ toss in a stalk of celery
for the perfect bag.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a service clerk has no choice but to tediously fill
plastic bag after plastic bag, a most unsatisfying task because
these bags have no side support. If you try to consolidate, you
risk bag breakage. Gone are the days when you could develop a
rhythm, slapping cans and baby food jars from counter to hand to
bag in a fluid blur of motion.
</P>
<P>
   The customers, bless them, are reconciled to annoying plastic
bag overload. What's more, when you smile and make eye contact and
offer to carry their groceries, they seem momentarily taken aback _
and then charmed by the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of my Saturday afternoon shift was a Royal Palm
Beach customer with a small pickup truck who had strung an elastic
cord across the bed, just aft the cab. ``Watch this,'' she smiled,
unhooking the cord and then stringing a dozen bags by their loops
across the truck. ``That was my daughter Jennifer's idea.''
</P>
<P>
   My Humble Recommendation (MHR): A good job for a youngster to
showcase a helpful attitude and move up. Only retirees with strong
lower backs need apply. For more satisfying stashing, encourage
customers to choose paper over plastic. _ _ VETERINARY ASSISTANT
</P>
<P>
   I might have been a little more helpful at Dr. Joan McMindes'
Native Palm Animal Hospital in Jupiter if I had stood around with
my thumb in my ear and simply watched.
</P>
<P>
   But no, I had to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day is different,'' said veterinary assistant Monique
Pierpont, doing 17 things at once. When a patient comes in, its
record is pulled up on computer, the animal is weighed, petted,
talked to and treated as if it is the center of the universe, which
is usually the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``China,'' a 15-year-old female boxer, came in with a pinkish
growth bulging through the pad on her left hind paw. Blood was
drawn and it was Pierpont who detected the signs of a malignancy. A
swollen lymph node on the leg all but cinched it. Cancer. The
growth would be removed by laser surgery that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Assistants know just how to grasp a foreleg to facilitate
drawing a blood sample. They make stains, analyze blood, look at a
mysterious skin rashes on the tummy of a tabby and say, ``hmmmm,''
as sagely as any physician.
</P>
<P>
   Pierpont began preparation of a rambunctious 5-month old German
shepherd for spaying. Together we hoisted the animal onto a table
and in a trice the pup was anesthetized and flat on its back, its
paws restrained by soft straps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' said Pierpont, handing me electric shears. ``Shave her
belly and prep the incision site.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, tummy fur falls away like lamb's wool under the
shears. I used several pads of soap and alcohol to swab the
incision site. And then I watched McMindes perform the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start feeling faint, you don't have to stay,'' said the
vet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that you mention it, I could use some fresh air,'' I said,
hurrying for the door.
</P>
<P>
   MHR: As a veterinary assistant, I'd make a good cage cleaner. _
_ SCHOOL CAFETERIA FOOD SERVER
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't considered this line of work, it may be because
you thought only surly middle-aged women with the forearms of a
Swedish masseuse were eligible.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the servers still sweat. That's because they work between a
steam table and a pizza oven. But they're cheerful.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? The kids are cute as Beanie Babies and they knew
what they wanted for lunch when they got up this morning: Pizza. I
exaggerate, but not by much.
</P>
<P>
   The day I served at Wynnebrook Elementary in West Palm Beach,
students had a choice (can you believe it?): Turkey and dressing
with cornbread and peas, pizza, a sub, a hot dog or a hamburger. It
was like dealing blackjack. One out of seven kids wanted the
regular meal, three opted for pizza, two chose hot dogs, one chose
hamburger, and subs were wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day starts early _ 6:30 a.m.,'' explains Theresa Graham,
cafeteria manager. ``It helps to know food preparation, smile, and
be willing to pitch in and help your co-workers.''
</P>
<P>
   And the No. 1 job requirement? ``To understand that we are here
to make the kids happy.''
</P>
<P>
   MHR: If you're an early riser who can stand the heat in the
kitchen, this would be one of those jobs that makes the day fly. A
head that looks good in a hair net is entirely optional. _ _
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH FOOD SALES
</P>
<P>
   Between them, Maureen Miller and Judy Williams have 28 years
behind the counter at Mother Nature's Pantry in Palm Beach. What
they don't know about what's good for what ails you would probably
fit into a sassafras tea bag.
</P>
<P>
   So when I took my place behind the counter it was to listen and
learn. (What I know _ ``Dairy products cause mucous'' _ not
everybody wants to hear.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't even on computer,'' Miller says. ``Our inventory
control is our customer who says, `I just got your last bottle of
whatever.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the latest trend?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carbs are out. Fats are out. The Adkins Diet is in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you pushing?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miracle Water, it's the greatest for athletes,'' Miller said.
``Replaces your electrolytes with no calories, no sugar or
sodium.'' Just bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   And Judy? ``Liquid chlorophyl,'' she said. ``It's a great blood
cleanser.''
</P>
<P>
   A customer brought a bag of millet to the counter. Why? Who eats
millet? ``It tastes like rice,'' the customer explained, ``but I
have a staph infection, and millet helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Flax oil, so they say, is good for the brain and reducing
cholesterol. Rice milk _ a product called Rice Dream _ replaces
milk but takes getting used to. There are probably 100 varieties of
teas, some merely for sipping, others said to be sovereign for
every ailment from eczema to gout.
</P>
<P>
   A supplement called Ginkgo Biloba is taken for short-term memory
problems, and capsules of something called chondroitin sulfate
seems to help some cases of arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like to see our laxative section?'' Miller asked,
directing me to shelves of remedies. ``We call it Corner a-Go-Go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't take me there,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   MHR: Not for the bashful. Be prepared to hear complete medical
histories and get constant feedback on what works and what doesn't
work. _ _ Palm Beach County Library Reference Clerk
</P>
<P>
   Ah _ my career after my career! If after retirement my wife
needs to keep me out of the house, I can think of no happier
employment than fielding reference desk questions at the library. I
tried it for two hours. I liked it, even if I had to hand off the
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take about 2,000 calls a month,'' said reference manager
Jane Craig at the Summit library. ``We get questions ranging from
side effects of medicines to grammar to finding a company that
certifies nuclear power plants.''
</P>
<P>
   One of my first callers wanted books on wolfhounds. With clerk
Janalee Garwood doing the computer search, we quickly found one
book on hand, and where others in the country could be located.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor can help when a child calls and asks an overly
general question:
</P>
<P>
   Child: ``Do you have information on elephants?''
</P>
<P>
   Librarian (with twinkle in voice): ``Certainly. Would you want
to know how to grow an elephant or cook one?''
</P>
<P>
   MHR: If you can't be a newspaper columnist, be a reference
librarian.

 &HT;    Property values rising at private dorms near UT
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Private dorms near the University of Texas are among
the hottest properties in Austin, with some more than doubling in
value since last year, according to 1998 property appraisals.
</P>
<P>
   This could be bad news for students because higher appraisals
usually translate into higher taxes, and managers could raise rents
to compensate.
</P>
<P>
   The appraised value of Dobie Center, a high-rise dorm at 2021
Guadalupe St., more than doubled from $14.9 million last year to
$33 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   University Towers on 24th Street jumped from $13.6 million to
$23.1 million. The Castilian, at 2323 San Antonio St., increased 80
percent in value to $17.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the increase-- , according to Travis Central
Appraisal District officials who calculate property values for tax
purposes, is that several dorms have sold recently, drawing much
more than their value on the tax rolls. The Castilian, for example,
sold for about $17 million last year, while its appraised value was
$9.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the fact that the dorms have been notoriously full
in the past year, and property appraisers said it was more than
enough reason to take a second look at high-rise dorms near campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a resurgence in the dormitory market,'' said
appraiser Mary Kieke. ``Apartments have gotten so expensive,
students have come back to dorms. Many dorms have been full in the
past year, and operating incomes have been up.''
</P>
<P>
   The private dorms near UT haven't seen a significant increase in
value since the 1980s, before the recession and the bottoming-out
of the real estate market, Kieke said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorm managers and owners, shocked by the sharp rise in
appraisals, all say they will protest them. ``I just don't
understand how they came up with their figures,'' said Ugene Olson,
manager of the University Towers, which saw a 70 percent increase
in value over last year. ``I've been here since 1991, and there's
no way our income has doubled, yet they say we've increased more
than double in value.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, many students have signed leases for the fall and most
dorms have waiting lists. Rental rates at private dorms vary by the
kind of room and meal plan requested. The average starting rate for
next fall at large private dorms is about $6,500 per academic year.
</P>
<P>
   Students could face higher rents next year, if managers and
owners must pay more in taxes, which will happen if the tax rate
stays the same or increases for 1998. Olson said students have
already signed contracts locking in prices for next fall, but by
fall 1999, his rates could jump to make up the additional taxes. If
the tax rates stay the same, University Towers would be liable for
an additional $904 a day in taxes based on its new appraisal, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At Dobie, starting rents for next fall have been set tentatively
at $6,200, but managers say they could raise them before classes
start. At the Castilian, managers say it's too early to tell
whether or not the dorm would have to raise its rent.
</P>
<P>
   Dabo Horsfall, a junior who is living at the Castilian this
summer, said students shouldn't be burdened with higher rents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a college town, so I see why everything is high,'' he
said. ``But students are already paying enough. Many have to work
to pay their rent and go to school. They can't afford to pay
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Appraisal district officials say that dorm values have
fluctuated wildly over the years, depending on the boom and bust
cycle of real estate and the flow of students through UT.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the Dobie Center appraised anywhere from $6 million
to $26 million just over a few years,'' Kieke said. ``I think it's
safe to say the market is very cyclical.''

 &HT;    Don't look to Jazz for sign of champion
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Utah Jazz are trying to remain upbeat despite
being one game from elimination.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Jazz must believe overcoming something nobody has
in the Finals, a 3-1 deficit, and doing it against the greatest
dynasty in sports in the past 30 years, the Chicago Bulls, is
almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought all season to be where we wanted to be and now we
get here and tend to slack off a little bit,'' center Greg Foster
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the sign of a true championship team.''.
</P>
<P>
   The sign of a true champion is burying an opponent when the time
is right, which is what the Bulls intend to do in Game 5 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see belief in their eyes, and we've got to take that
belief away from them,'' Michael Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to ... don't just stab them, but turn it once you
stick it in them.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest wound came during Game 3, the Bulls' record-breaking
42-point win.
</P>
<P>
   But trailing 2-1, Utah had one chance to recover in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Bulls all but put the champagne on ice with an 86-82
victory Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz are making excuses, saying they had chances to win
Games 2 and 4 and they could be the ones ahead 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   But those are excuses teams make when they see hope fading.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Utah had chances to win both games, but it was Jordan and
Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman who made the plays. Not John
Stockton and Karl Malone and Jeff Hornacek.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, specifically, has failed to live up to his personal
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Before the series, Malone said the outcome would depend on how
well the Jazz's big men performed. He was right.
</P>
<P>
   They have been awful.
</P>
<P>
   Malone refuses to give Rodman credit, but the fact is Rodman has
shut down Malone during the most crucial stages.
</P>
<P>
   Malone has a combined two points in the fourth quarters of Games
2 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is we can't be making our summer plans, this is
not over yet,'' Malone said. ``And then, second of all, you don't
want to make history.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Drawing the line: The Jazz, who led the league in free throws
made with 24.9 per game in the regular season, are averaging 13
during the Finals. Malone made 7.7 during the year and has 16 in
four Finals games.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who clearly has evaded taking the ball to the basket
when being guarded by Rodman, evaded the question Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about it, really,'' he said. When asked
specifically if it was a matter of him not driving, he said:
``Let's just say it's a matter of not going to the basket and leave
it like that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ No center lane: Adam Keefe started at center for the Jazz on
Wednesday, marking the third starter in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Foster started Games 1 and 2 and Greg Ostertag started Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our centers were really slow in reacting with what's happening
offensively and that's one of our main problems,'' Jazz coach Jerry
Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   Keefe was the most effective. Entering Game 4, Ostertag and
Foster had 12 fouls and six field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Keefe had six points and seven rebounds in 20 minutes in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   _ Out of reach: OK, die-hard Bulls fans: How badly to you want
to see what could be Jordan's last game for Chicago's NBA
champions?
</P>
<P>
   Enough to take out a second mortgage?
</P>
<P>
   Enough to cancel your vacation?
</P>
<P>
   Enough to dip into the kids' college funds?
</P>
<P>
   A check with Chicago-area ticketbrokers found that what are
usually the cheap seats _ $40 each in the regular season _ are now
selling for $700. Moving down to the $90 seats will cost from
$1,200 to $1,600. Tickets for courtside seats _ with face values
ranging from $120 to $425 _ are going for $4,000 on average, but as
much as a whopping $9,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Easy to spot: Hairstyles and off-the-court interests aren't
the only things that set apart Jordan and Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Jud Buechler said you can look outside the team bus and
immediately tell which fans have turned out to see Jordan and which
are Rodman fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis is the Elvis of the Underground. He brings some
creatures out from the night. That's his fan club,'' Buechler said,
laughing. ``Michael just has the regular All-American kids. You
never really see a good, clean-cut kid wearing a 91 jersey. And if
you do, you kind of shake your head on it.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, actress-director Penny Marshall was
sporting a Rodman jersey for Game 4 Wednesday at the United Center.

   THE SALES ROLL ON
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hey dude, skateboarding's back. The National Sporting
Goods Association says skateboarding eclipsed mountain biking and
golf last year to become this country's fastest growing activity
for which you need sports equipment. Hurt in recent years by
in-line skating, skateboarding recovered strongly, with 6.3 million
skaters lurching through streets and parks last year, a 35.8
percent increase over the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, why? Scott Kelliher, the director of marketing
for the New York-based Blades, Board and Skate shops, said that the
style and fashion associated with skateboarding has enhanced its
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tons of small companies producing everything from
clothing, sneakers and watches to the boards themselves, which are
amazing,'' he said. He also attributed the resurgence to wider
exposure of the pastime (it doesn't sound right to call it a sport)
on television in ESPN's X-Games and in MTV Sports. ``Skateboarding
is beginning to show up everywhere, even in the Gap ads,'' Kelliher
added.

   Flowery Greeters
</P>
<P>
   When Steven Spielberg and Donna Karan arrive at their East
Hampton, N.Y., retreats, after a long week in the film and fashion
trenches, they want to relax in rooms made welcoming by fresh-cut
flowers. But they're not in the mood to stop first at the village
florist, then mess with vases and unwieldy delphiniums.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Paul Goerz, who precedes them home on Friday afternoons
and fills rooms with delicate and romantic floral arrangements.
(Spielberg likes all white; Ms. Karan prefers colorful, theatrical
displays.)
</P>
<P>
   Goerz's business, A New Leaf, (516) 329-2646, charges $150 a
room. He's one of the new florists making house calls in the
Hamptons, where the notion of flowers used to be limited to
telegraphed carnations or zinnias from a farm stand.
</P>
<P>
   Mecox Gardens, (516) 287-5015, in Southampton, the most
elaborate service, charges about $1,500 a week to dress up a home
with fancy blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Potted Gardens, (516) 537-6235, which operates out of an
old-fashioned, ivy-covered shed in Bridgehampton, is known for its
countrified arrangements like roses with a few stalks of celery.
For about $250, weekly Potted Gardens customers get five vases of
flowers delivered _ plus coffee and the newspaper.

   Bridal Statistics
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for the June onslaught of dyed-to-match shoes, a
paperback of frank statistics on how people meet, marry and survive
the first year of nuptial bliss is arriving in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a survey of 3,876 Americans who have been married an
average of 9.6 months, ``Just Married'' (Andrews McMeel Publishing,
$8.95) by Barry Sinrod and Marlo Grey offers amusing and sometimes
surprising data.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the belief that holding out on the sexual front
guarantees a mate, 17 percent of the respondents chose to
consummate their marriage on the first date. The spouses who say
``I love you'' least often to their partners are over 40 and
married for the first time. Those who say it the most are on their
third marriage, or more.
</P>
<P>
   In those rare unions in which the wife commands the television
remote control (15 percent), she has been previously married and
has an income of her own of at least $75,000. Of the men surveyed,
86 percent said they fell in love with their wives at first sight;
only 41 percent of the women said the same. Finally, if you believe
it's just as easy to marry a rich spouse as a poor one, keep in
mind that those who earn more than $75,000 took an average of two
years to make a commitment after the first meeting. That's bad news
for the 1 percent who said they married for a single reason: money.

   Richard Karnatz is an artist who may not have made it into the
Whitney Museum of American Art, but at least his barbecue aprons
are in the Whitney Museum's Store. Printed with 1950s images of

$40 each at the Whitney, Madison Avenue at 74th Street.

   ``I started the business by making a new apron for myself to
wear in my print shop,'' said Karnatz, a fine-arts printer who owns
Bent Fish Editions in Manhattan. ``All my clients wanted them, so I
started giving them out as promotional gifts _ even to potential
clients like Chuck Close.'' Karnatz's own silk-screened artworks
are on show at Bendix Diner (First Avenue at 10th Street).

   Anyone who thinks he'll be huge someday might want to collect
the apron series.

<P>
   TOKYO _ The world's second-largest economy sank at a stunning
annual rate of 5.3 percent in the first quarter of this year,
according to official figures released Friday that painted an even
bleaker picture than many economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
   While Japan's economy has been troubled for many months, the
latest official numbers confirmed that economic output has declined
for two consecutive quarters _ the definition generally accepted by
economists for a recession. In addition, they showed that for the
first time since the oil shock of 1974, the economy actually
declined for a full year _ falling by 0.7 percent for the fiscal
year ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Such dismal numbers contributed to a further fall in the yen,
sent shock waves throughout Asia and heightened fears that the
economic crisis could spread from Asia to the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials took care to release Friday's news after the
stock market had closed for the day. Earlier, driven largely by the
declining yen, South Korea's stock market fell by 8 percent Friday,
while the Nikkei 225 benchmark index dipped below 15,000 in the
morning, before closing at 15,022.33, up 8.29 points.
</P>
<P>
   The weaker yen makes Japanese products cheaper and more
competitive, further damaging the economies of its East Asian
neighbors, triggering a relentless spiral of currency devaluations,
and destabilizing financial markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the United States thus far has been mixed, with
consumers benefiting from cheaper imports and lower interest rates
made possible, in part, by the slowdown in Asia. But U.S. corporate
profits have declined recently, in part because of the contraction
in Asian markets. There is fear as well that continued financial
decline in Japan and East Asia could trigger a panic that would
spread to the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials again warned Friday that the yen is falling
too far and too fast. It now takes about 144 yen to buy one dollar,
meaning that the yen has fallen 80 percent since its peak in 1995.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will cause a minus effect on the Japanese
economy, `` Koji Omi, head of the Economic Planning Agency, said of
the weak yen Friday, according to Kyodo News Service. But it poses
problems, he added, ``for the whole of the world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Mobile, Ala., on Friday, U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin characterized the economic data as ``worse than
expected.'' He reiterated his view that Japan needs to embrace
fundamental reforms of its financial structure and to vigorously
stimulate its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Economies are slumping throughout Asia as well as in Russia and
Eastern Europe, he said, adding that ``the center of the problem is
in Japan, and it's a very serious problem for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Li Zhaoxing, China's ambassador to the United States, called
upon the Group of Seven industrialized nations and Japan to take
action to bolster the yen. ``They know their situation, they know
they have means available,'' Li said. ``If there's a will, there's
a way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists believe that Japan's economy may recover in the
short term, in part because of a huge fiscal stimulus package that
will begin to be felt in the next few weeks. But others warn that
Japan is itself teetering on the edge of a much greater tumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things could fall apart very quickly here and Japan could go
like other countries in Asia _ completely fall apart, or it could
linger on,'' said Brian Rose, an economist at LTCB Warburg
Securities Ltd., a joint venture between Long-Term Credit Bank and
SBC Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Rose cautioned that Japan is now in the throes of an
unpredictable transition to more of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Eastern Europe, if you introduce shock therapy and go
from a non-market to a market, the short term disruption is
enormous,'' Rose said. He added, however, that once the transition
is made, Japan could be poised for strong growth again.
</P>
<P>
   Shimpei Nukaya, vice minister of the Economic Planning Agency,
which released the economic numbers, said that the negative impact
on Japan's economy from the Asian economic crisis was bigger than
the government had expected and that the figures ``underline the
gloomy situation of the national's real economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sluggish for several years, Japan's economy fell into a
recessionary spiral on the impetus of a tax increase last year,
imposed at a moment when the economy instead required a stimulus,
in the view of many economists, who believe that no adequate fiscal
stimulus has yet been applied.
</P>
<P>
   Sales are down at many medium-sized businesses, and Mom-and-Pop
shops are particularly feeling the pinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no customers, even at this hour,'' said Yasuhiko Sato,
a 30-year-old vendor selling tuna fish during lunchtime. ``I see
shops closing down in this area. My bonus is very low. It's
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Teikoku Databank, a private credit research agency, said Friday
that the number of corporate failures in May rose 37.5 percent from
a year ago to 1,791. It was the highest total for the month of May
since 1984.

 TOKYO: since 1984.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Hachiro Hattori, a 75-year-old vendor of wrapping materials,
the solution is to put his pension income into his ailing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I can survive if we buy only food,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement offered new data only for the
January-to-March period, but since Japan's fiscal year ends March
30 the new figures meant that over the course of the last fiscal
year the nation's gross domestic product fell 0.7 percent. That was
the first absolute decline in output since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Exports for the first quarter also declined by 3.8 percent, the
first drop in a dozen years, as troubled Asian economies
drastically cut back on their imports from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable figures to assess economic performance
since then but there is scant evidence of improvement. Still, with
Parliamentary elections next month, the government is trying
desperately to cheer people up.
</P>
<P>
   The elections will choose representatives to the parliament's
upper house, which is less important than the lower house. Still
the election is an important gauge of public sentiment, and Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto wants to do well so as to boost his own
standing and his ability to hold on to his office.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Hashimoto won an expected victory when the Lower House
of Parliament rejected a no-confidence motion against his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Officials point out that the government's massive $111 billion
stimulus package seems about to be approved by the Parliament,
clearing the way for a rush of public funds into the economy. The
ruling Liberal Democratic Party is counting heavily on the public
money to pick up growth.
</P>
<P>
   But industrial production was down six percent in April from the
year before, corporate profits have tumbled 25 percent from the
previous year, prices are falling ominously, and some economists
warn that Japan may be sinking into a deflationary spiral.
Economists fear a vicious cycle in which falling prices and profits
would lead to rising unemployment, which would curb consumption and
bring down prices further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a deflation, that's pretty clear.'' said Robert Alan
Feldman, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. But he added
that the stimulus package would stop the spiral, though not
deflation.
</P>
<P>
   Capital spending for the first quarter fell 5.1 percent, the
steepest decline since 1965. The government also released figures
Friday showing that Japanese manufacturers plan to reduce spending
by 4.4 percent on plant and equipment in the current fiscal year,
which began on April 1. The decline was the first one in four
years, according to the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly hard to see a way out at this point,'' said
Peter Morgan, an economist at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. Morgan
said that Japan needs far-reaching restructuring and added, ``We
are talking about a fundamental transformation of the economic
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese government officials have annoyed some analysts by
seeming to downplay the seriousness of the situation. In the past,
they frequently argued that the economy was simply ''stagnant'' or
at a ``standstill,'' refusing to acknowledge that it was actually
contracting. Indeed, many foreign-based economists have contended
that Japan entered a recession many months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Economic Planning Agency here are expected to
meet later this month to formally discuss when the recession began.

appraisals usually translate into higher taxes, and managers could
raise rents to compensate. (Tanamachi, Austin American-Statesman)

past 30 years, the Chicago Bulls, is almost impossible. (D'Angelo,

   From his vantage point as the chief investment officer of
Deutsche Bank, Hanspeter Ackermann sees expanding opportunities for
investors in a unifying Europe. As portfolio manager of the bank's
closed-end New Germany fund, a $665 million growth fund invested
primarily in midsize German companies, Ackermann is deploying money
to pursue some of those opportunities. And as a Swiss citizen, he
sees firsthand the significance of being inside or outside the euro
club. _ By SHARON R. KING
</P>
<P>
   Q. How will investing in Europe change as a result of the
creation of the single European currency?
</P>
<P>
   A. The top-down style of selecting stocks, where you analyze
country, industry and then go down to the stock level, probably
becomes irrelevant. The opposite of that is a bottom-up manager,
which basically is our style. We really don't look at macro themes,
but much more company-specific data.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the country fund itself at some point will
probably have to be wider. I can imagine that some funds might
consider changing to a more European-based fund.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How should American investors be thinking about the part of
their portfolio that they will invest in a changing Europe?
</P>
<P>
   A. Before, you had different countries, like Germany and France,
individually fighting for market share. They all looked
insignificant relative to a large country like the United States.
Now this is changing. You have a major competitor _ let's just call
it Europe. It has a much more powerful industrial base. It will not
be inhibited by any cross-border taxation or inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   What we're going to see here is a major structural change, much
higher efficiency. I think that there will probably be more money
allocated to Europe than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about countries that remain outside the monetary union?
</P>
<P>
   A. For a country like Britain, it's probably less of an issue to
be in or out, because it's a much larger economy with much less
dependence on Europe. The U.K. has had more cross-border alliances
with the United States than with Europe, so it will be easier for
the U.K. to stand outside and to remain outside.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Switzerland, I see difficulties for that country
to stay out and to compete with the border restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how much the financial sector will be affected, but
you could see some impact mainly from the currency translation on
other manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the Swiss franc is relatively strong, and that's
obviously damaging the export industry. But currency fluctuations
may make it difficult for corporations to plan ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For the smaller European countries, sooner or later they're
going to be forced into the same situation, where there will be an
overwhelming economic case for joining the European Monetary Union.
So, my guess will be they're all going to join over time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will companies in countries outside of the monetary union
have growth problems? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. Distribution will be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   I'm from Switzerland. When I walk through customs in Europe,
they treat me like any other passport holder. But if you are part
of the union, they basically just wave you through.
</P>
<P>
   The same effect will probably occur on any distribution or
licensing agreement. You would rather give the members of the union
preferential treatment. So obviously there's an advantage to be
part of the union.
</P>
<P>
   Q. From an investment standpoint, will countries outside of the
monetary union be riskier?
</P>
<P>
   A. They should be. You're dealing with higher currency risk;
then you have the economic risk of not gaining access to the same
markets. There's even a risk of size, which means a liquidity risk.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you pick stocks for the bank's funds?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are five criteria. The most important is earnings
momentum, to which we allocate roughly one-third of the investment
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Another third would be management. We look at the track record
and the commitment to enhance the company's value. The final third
is split between the financial strength of the company and its
overall value versus the industry, the stock's history and the
market itself.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are some stocks you own that fit your criteria?
</P>
<P>
   A. One of our biggest holdings is Adidas. We have 8.6 percent of
the fund in that company. They have acquired Salomon, the ski
producer. When we look at other companies like Nike, or Puma in
Europe, most of them have lost market share to Adidas-Salomon. And
this is one of the few true growth stories in Germany, in our
belief.
</P>
<P>
   This company has excellent management. We see roughly 20 to 25
percent earnings growth consistently into the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   What's not included in that figure yet is the effects of the
Salomon acquisition. Salomon has had its strength mainly in France,
and Adidas has had its strength mostly in Germany. But now there
should be a massive benefit from synergies.
</P>
<P>
   We also like Continental AG. We have about 4.3 percent of the
fund in that. Continental has had compound earnings growth of about
25 percent for three years, and I think it has been overlooked by
the market.
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting is that they're really a leader in
technology. There's huge free cash flow, and 1998 should be a
turnaround year for the company as margins increase.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe there are two other major tire companies, Pirelli and
Michelin. In our view, there's no room for three major companies in
Europe, so at some point you're going to see a merger or alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In Wella AG, the beauty products company, we've seen a
management turnaround. In the past, Wella's management has not been
very open, and they came to a point in 1995 where the management
disappointed and earnings fell by about 50 percent. That obviously
shocked the market.
</P>
<P>
   The perception was: We cannot trust that firm anymore. But the
company did make changes within the management to come back and
regain the confidence. I think we were one of the first to
recognize that they are pursuing a much more shareholder-friendly
attitude.

     RENO URGES LOWERING HURDLES TO FEDERAL
PROSECUTION OF HATE CRIMES
 &HT;     By SAMAR ABULHASSAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday urged the
federal government to respond when ``hate speaks out'' by
eliminating ``hurdles'' that prevent the prosecution of hate crimes
to the fullest degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen in Jasper, Texas, an example that hate and
bigotry in its worst and most tragic form is still with us,'' Reno
told the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee's national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   In what has been labeled a hate crime, James Byrd Jr. was
dragged, dismembered, and decapitated by three white men near
Jasper last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us can relax when that happens,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno blamed current federal law for preventing ``the most
heinous crimes'' from being prosecuted. The federal civil rights
statute deals with hate crimes only if they involve the use of
force based on a person's race, color, religion or national origin
and if they interfere with certain federally protected activities,
such as attending a school that receives federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Reno said, the federal government can prosecute a
racially motivated crime ``if it occurs in the parking lot of a
public school but not if it occurs across the street in the private
yard of a family home.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno endorsed legislation sponsored by Sens. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass. and Arlen Specter, R-Pa. that would punish any attack that
caused injury and was based on race, ethnicity or religion,
regardless of whether federally protected activities were involved.
The bill would also add sexual orientation, gender and disability
to the list of motivations that define hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The Hate Crime Act of 1998 was also endorsed Friday by Kweisi
Mfume, president of the National Association for Advancement of
Colored People, who said that ``Congress should waste no time in
passing this much-needed legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate is still a destructive force in America and requires the
strongest sanctions and penalties that the law can provide,'' Mfume
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she is forming a task force that would bring nearly
federal 100 attorneys nationwide to work with state enforcement
agencies to address the issue of hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI, 8,759 hate crimes were reported to federal
agencies in 1996, with 5,396 of the incidents based on race.
</P>
<P>
   Reno speech also addressed the topics of diversity and Arab
American concerns of being ``targeted'' by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer period dominated by the subject of
alleged ``targeting'' of Arabs and Muslims by the Justice
Department, Reno said she would review concerns involving an
Immigration and Naturalization Service practice of deporting
immigrants it deems has political affiliations based on secret
evidence. Reno is facing a lawsuit pending before the Supreme Court
on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are losing their lives while they're
incarcerated,'' said Sarah Alfadl, a Pennsylvania attorney who said
that her client _ detained in Florida on the basis of secret
evidence _ suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and ``may
die in custody.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who said she recognized that the Justice Department
relationship with Arabs and Muslims may have been ``troubled'' in
the past, said her office was ``committed to a new and better
understanding'' of the Arab American community.

   CHINESE-THEATER (New York) _ New York City's last
Chinese-language theater, the Music Palace, will soon take its
final bow, its faded three-story structure to be demolished and
replaced by a gleaming office building. The growing popularity of
videotapes is partly to blame, along with Chinese cable TV programs
and other options for staying in touch with the homeland. But the
theater's passing is also a small milestone in the story of the
Chinese in America, a shift toward the mainstream that recalls the

who once had thriving theaters, too. By David Chen.

   CLINTON-OCEANS (Monterey, Calif.) _ Clinton, navigating a narrow

Friday a 10-year extension on the current moratorium on oil
drilling off virtually all American coastlines. Clinton also placed
several existing marine sanctuaries permanently off-limits to oil
exploration. The moratorium does not, however, affect the extensive

`X' MARKS THE PLOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Strange. Alarming. Like nothing they could have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, the guys responsible for TV's hit supernatural drama ``The
X-Files'' sure wandered into an unknown universe when they decided
to make a movie based on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Set somewhere between the recently completed fifth season and
the new episodes that start airing in the fall, ``The X-Files''
movie is a $70 million, two-hour version of the misadventures of
Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, the FBI agents charged with
investigating all things paranormal and paranoiac.
</P>
<P>
   Starring series regulars David Duchovny as the
I-want-to-believer and Gillian Anderson as the
objectivity-challenged skeptic, the movie was co-written and
produced by series creator Chris Carter and directed by Rob Bowman,
who has helmed 25 ``X'' TV episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick was not to make it too different from the show, but
to also make a movie that was accessible to people who didn't watch
the show every week,'' explains Carter, a tanned, sun-blond
41-year-old who looks like he worked 13 years for Surfing magazine.
``We had to avoid alienating the hard-core fan, not bore him by
reillustrating the world in which Mulder and Scully exist. I hope
we've been successful at that; it was the trickiest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true ... writer-producer. According to Bowman, who
made his feature directing debut with the forgotten teen picture
``Airborne,'' making the comparatively cinematic TV show fit for
movie theaters required wholesale rethinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to take the essence of what we had done on TV and
just put it on the big screen,'' Bowman explains. ``But there are
requirements for those two media that just innately mean that you
do different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the size of the image matters; you cannot shoot two
hours of close-ups and expect to get away with it. The pacing of
the editing can be slower _ cuts have more impact, since it's not
just the little box that changes, but the whole wall that jumps.
Your locations become much more important because they're huge now.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for characterizations, we just took what we built and tried
to make 'em look like movie stars, make them fill the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   For Duchovny, who's enjoyed a steady if not quite stellar film
career (``Beethoven,'' ``Kalifornia,'' ``Playing God'') alongside
TV superstardom, adjusting Mulder was a matter of fine calibrations
_ and some good liquor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really approach the movie as being different from the
show,'' Duchovny says. ``You know, it is the same character, and I
wanted to do justice to that. It wasn't like it was my Vegas
routine, like, `OK, here's the big stage, so I'm gonna show you
some real interesting tricks.' In fact, I wanted it, if anything,
less on a bigger screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a good percentage of the 20 million to 30 million
people who tune in the Fox network series on Sunday nights can be
counted on to show up for the movie, the unfamiliar still have to
be oriented as to what was going on with the complex mythology
that's built up over the course of 117 episodes. They also need to
be clued in on Mulder's obsession with extraterrestrials and the
powerful conspiracy that seems to be hiding their existence.
</P>
<P>
   But do true X-philes want to hear all that again? Probably not,
unless it's funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to do this fun scene in a bar where I've had too much to
drink and am pouring out my troubles to the bartender,'' Duchovny
says. ``That way, I got to introduce the character to people who
didn't know him _ without insulting those who did. It's good that
the character was drunk, and I put a burp in there at the end; I
don't know if they used it.''
</P>
<P>
   We're not going to tell. And even if we did, it might not be the
same when you see the movie. Carter and company have a way of
disinforming both casual viewers and ardent investigators. To keep
the revelations of ``The X-Files'' movie secret, script pages were
printed on noncopyable red paper, a key scene was not written and
filmed until this spring (most of the movie was shot during the
series' summer hiatus last year), and dummy scenes that were never
meant to be filmed were disseminated over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real paranoid about plot leaks,'' Carter admits. ``I
provided lots of opportunities for misinformation; if you put
enough bogus information out there, it starts to work for you and
against itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Isn't this what the government/international
creeps/interplanetary weirdos do in most episodes of ``X-Files,''
and the kind of deviousness our heroes Mulder and Scully are
forever crusading against?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there are some things that should be kept secret,'' says
Carter, refusing to acknowledge the irony. ``I'm not devious.
You've just got to be clever.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we think we can tell you about the movie: It starts
in 35,000 B.C. Texas, when it was very cold there. It climaxes in
modern-day Antarctica, which looks a lot like Texas did 37,000
years ago. A building gets bombed, Scully gets abducted and
experimented with for the umpteenth time, the Black Oil is sort of
explained, a semi-recurring character seems to actually die, and
the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) has something to do
with everything.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Mulder and Scully finally ... Well, like most things
``X-Files,'' what Mulder and Scully do remains inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   There was more, at one time, for devoted followers to chew on.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, there was mention of Mulder's sister, Samantha,
in the movie,'' Carter reveals. (As a child, Mulder saw her
abducted by what appeared to be aliens, and his need to know what
became of her drives both the character and the series' mythology.)
``But we decided to take that information out. We felt that that
was less important to the movie than the series, and it tripped you
up if you didn't quite understand all its implications. It was one
morsel of information too many to digest in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another thing I learned about making movies,'' Carter
continues. ``You try to take out any inessential ingredients as you
go through and put it together. As a viewer, you don't want
anything that is not perfectly integral to the whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Some big questions are still out there. Like, will enough
nonfans come to theaters to make a series of ``X-Files'' movies
viable?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people just don't watch television, and a lot of those
people do go to the movies on Friday or Saturday night,'' Carter
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to tell,'' a more skeptical Duchovny admits.
``I don't think you need to know the characters or the history of
the show to enjoy this. I would say it's a big, smart, thrilling
movie that's fun to watch _ if you like smart, thrilling movies,
which apparently some people do hate.''
</P>
<P>
   If the film does enough business to justify sequels, then wither
the series? Duchovny, Anderson and Carter are each signed up for at
least two more seasons, but the actors, at least, would prefer to
reopen ``The X-Files'' on a less strenuous,
feature-every-couple-of-years timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked playing Scully, and making the show has
always been fun,'' Anderson confirms. But the Emmy-winning actress
would also like to be able to spend more time with her young
daughter and take more advantage of the many movie offers that are
coming her way. ``From the writing to the cinematography to the
co-stars, just as a whole, the show works so tightly and so well.
But I like the scenario of being involved in a movie franchise that
gets us together every few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny has been more vocal about his problems with series TV's
demands. He's complained about the punishing schedule and
threatened to leave the show last season unless its production
location was moved from more cost-effective Vancouver to L.A. so he
could be closer to his wife, actress Tea Leoni.
</P>
<P>
   The ``X-Files'' movie was shot here, and the show relocates to
Southern California beginning with the sixth season. But that won't
solve the basic problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really the show, or Mulder,'' Duchovny says. ``It's
just the bare fact of doing the same part. It's been five years. If
you were in a series called `Hamlet' for five years, it would be
the same thing. I would be tired of getting my mother to admit that
she had slept with my uncle, just as I'm tired of shaking the
Cigarette-Smoking Man and telling him to admit he slept with my
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, maybe it is `Hamlet'!'' the actor cracks. ``Maybe I'm
happy to be on the show! The show will go on. The movies will go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter seems the most optimistic about the show and the film
franchise's future _ which, by some logic, you can afford to be
when you're the world's most successful marketer of paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some apprehension about the move to Los Angeles, but
I'm happy about it because it provides me with interesting problems
to solve and creates opportunities to shoot things I couldn't have
in Vancouver,'' Carter says. ``And, coming on the tail of the
movie, it's going to be a fresh start for the series. I will always
be interested in television, because there are things you can do
there that you can't do in feature films, stories that don't take a
big-screen approach. But it is a matter of stamina. It's such
grueling, grinding, hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a point when you go into features because you
just don't have the energy for TV anymore,'' Carter reckons. ``And
I have been working in a vacuum of sorts, just doing television
shows. I get the Nielsen ratings, I know how many people appreciate
the show. But there's nothing like walking into a theater and
seeing the instant reaction of people.''

ON THE SCULLY SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``She's definitely buttoned-down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Emmy Award-winning ``X-Files'' star Gillian Anderson
describes the role that's made her rich, famous, a heroine of young
women and the dreamgirl of cyberactive young men everywhere like
she was objectively observing some odd clinical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, of course, comes off pretty no-nonsense herself. If it
weren't a part of her personality, she couldn't pull off that
special panache _ brainy, skeptical, stone-facedly self-controlled
_ that makes FBI agent Dana Scully one of television's most
fascinating and groundbreaking characters.
</P>
<P>
   But you can also detect contradictions and banked fires in the
29-year-old actress. Given the right stimulus, a wild side could
emerge, something Scully might deem as alien as a sewer-dwelling
human tapeworm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my outlets for any residual rebelliousness that crops
up in my daily life,'' Anderson says, tantalizingly declining to
give examples. ``But the course of events in one's life and the
degree of responsibilities one takes on sort of dictate how one can
or cannot be. Motherhood, becoming a scrutinized celebrity, having
to show up every day for the show ... I do miss the chance to just
go off and do something wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Now add to the list of Anderson's burgeoning responsibilities
that of movie star. But even that has more riding on it than your
average TV actor's initial forays into the costlier, higher-stakes
realm of feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and David Duchovny headline a $70 million film version
of their show, also called ``The X-Files,'' that opens Friday. Even
though there are many factors that will govern its commercial fate,
the industry will be judging how well the actors who play the
world's favorite unexplained phenomena-investigating,
conspiracy-chasing,
pathologically-reluctant-to-admit-they-adore-each-other couple come
off on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who reportedly was paid a tidy $4 million for her
first major film role, is typically cool about the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge was to come up with a script that appealed to
both the pre-existing television audience and the people who have
never seen the series before,'' she says, looking Scully stylish in
a white business blouse and modestly slit skirt. ``I think Chris
(Carter, the show's creator and movie's producer) and Frank
(Spotnitz, the veteran ``X'' scribe who co-wrote the film with
Carter) have absolutely stepped up to the plate in terms of that.
But I don't see there being any risk for me in doing the film at
all. I'm very happy with what I've seen _ and excited by it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Scully and Duchovny's Fox Mulder have been
reassigned to an anti-terrorist unit following the destruction of
the X-Files in last season's closing episode of the show. But that
doesn't stop them from getting involved in another alarming
operation rife with alien colonizers and their apparent allies, the
international Syndicate of rich, powerful, ruthless and mysterious
men.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging from a bombed-out building in Dallas to a bizarre
experimental facility beneath the Antarctic snowpack to FBI hearing
rooms in Washington where, as usual, Mulder and Scully have a lot
of explaining to do, the movie indeed delivers its share of summer
entertainment excitement. But the scene that may excite X-Philes
most involves a close encounter between Scully and Mulder in his
apartment building's hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleasantly struck by the love story within the
film,'' Anderson says. ``To me, it seemed stronger than it is in
the series. There was an apparent intimacy between the two of us
that I thought really added an extra element _ and which is
something you don't see very often in an action adventure film.''
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully put. But don't think Anderson is about to let
romantic notions run away with Scully's better judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A love affair would ruin the show!'' she insists. ``When would
we talk about it? When would we kiss? Flying around a corner and
just before we shoot an alien, we're going to smooch? I don't think
so. We come closer, then we pull apart in the series constantly.
We're in this dance together, and that's how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Anderson has been known to date several of the
series' guest actors. She was briefly married to one of the show's
assistant art directors, Clyde Klotz. The union produced daughter
Piper Maru, whom Anderson says ``teaches me a lot, mostly about
unconditional love and patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional success and the accompanying fame has put an
unexpected damper on her social life, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tricky, it's a big issue,'' she reveals. ``I've
experienced that a lot of men are threatened by a woman who makes
more money than they do over the long haul. So that's something
that needs to be discussed and considered when you're thinking of
being in a relationship with somebody. But then, when you go out on
a date with someone and you're not quite sure if it's going to work
out or not, the press on it forces the situation one way or
another.'' &QL; 
Then there's that other relationship the media can't seem to get
enough of: the supposedly frosty one between Anderson and Duchovny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shifts constantly, on a daily basis,'' Anderson
says, by way of not going on record as liking her co-star. ``There
have been some absurd things written about our relationship, and
there have been some very accurate things written about our
relationship. I don't think anybody can really understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Carter gives it the old college try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relationships are always difficult, I don't care who they
are,'' says the man who supposedly knows all the secrets of the
``X-Files'' universe. ``Any relationship that is 5 years old has
had its stresses and strains. But the fact that we're all still
together, and they're friends and they work together on a daily
basis I think suggests that it's a very healthy relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has been as vital to ``The X-Files'' health as the show
has been to her career. Born in Chicago and raised in London,
Puerto Rico and Michigan, she studied acting at the Windy City's
famed Goodman Theater School.
</P>
<P>
   She was also a complete punk at the time _ black clothes, Mohawk
hairdo, a piercing here and there _ and that decidedly
un-Scully-like presentation attitude traveled with her to L.A.
Though praised now for the exponential improvement in her fashion
taste over the last couple of years, initially Anderson was hardly
a casting director's dream.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter saw something in the grungy looking yet
self-possessed redhead at that first audition half a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a seriousness to her bearing that I knew was
Scully,'' he says. ``I knew she was someone who could deliver the
science believably. And she was, for me, not the kind of tootsie
that television likes to cast in male-female relationships. She had
it all.''
</P>
<P>
   And now she's itching for a little more. Anderson has made
several other movies _ ``The Mighty,'' ``Chicago Cab'' _ that are
awaiting release and is currently filming the relationship drama
``Dancing About Architecture'' opposite such formidable co-stars as
Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Mighty,'' which is based on the popular kids' novel
``Freak the Mighty,'' her character is an alcoholic biker type. One
of those rebel outlets she mentioned?
</P>
<P>
   At least Gillian Anderson has some. Which brings us back to the
subject of Scully and whether the poor gal ever has any fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Scully happy?'' she ponders. ``I think she could be, and
she wants to be. She could probably allow herself to be happy, but
it would be very difficult for her to switch attention from her
work to her personal life _ and away from Mulder, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think she's generally happy. Just because she doesn't
smile doesn't mean she's not happy.''
</P>

SOMETIMES 3 MANAGERS ARE BETTER THAN 1  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 14)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (af) 
 By CAROLE GOULD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hot industry trend _ some would say fad _ is the
concentrated fund: an offering that holds 30 or so stocks instead
of the typical 100 or more. Another is the so-called all-star fund,
in which several high-profile managers each run a slice of a
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the two and _ bingo _ you start another trend, funds in
which two or more star managers run a concentrated portfolio. Sun
America Asset Management and Prudential Securities just unveiled
two such funds.
</P>
<P>
   Sun America's Style Select Series Focus Portfolio combines the
top 10 stock picks of three high-powered fund managers: Elizabeth
Bramwell of Bramwell Capital Management, Thomas Marsico of Marsico
Capital Management and Spiros Segalas of Jennison Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential's 20/20 Focus fund drafts Segalas to pick his
favorite 20 growth stocks and combines those picks with 20 value
stocks selected by Thomas R. Jackson, who manages the Prudential
Equity fund.
</P>
<P>
   Such combination funds would appear to address two pressing
shortages in today's markets: a dwindling supply of smart
investment ideas and a dearth of management talent.
</P>
<P>
   Fund companies are putting the same handful of people on an
ever-growing number of dance cards. Sun America Style Select Focus,
for example, brings the number of offerings that Marsico has a hand
in running to five. Segalas has his fingers in Masters Select
Equity, an all-star fund, and runs Harbor Capital Appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Will such managers be overworked? In the case of Segalas, Tim
Biggs, a spokesman for Prudential Securities, said: ``Absolutely
not. His firm is built on running multiple portfolios, first for
institutions and then for individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts champion the trend, too _ with a caveat.
``I think they're a great idea because there are a lot of very
talented portfolio managers being forced to invest only in their
best ideas,'' said Susan Dziubinski, who edits the newsletter
Morningstar Fund Investor. ``The downside is that most of these
funds are very concentrated, which can produce outsized gains but
also very large losses.''
</P>
<P>
   But J. Steven Neamtz, executive vice president of Sun America
Asset Management, said the multimanager approach reduced the risk
of concentrated portfolios. ``Usually, you'd get one mind-set in 30
picks. Here, you get three points of view, which provide a certain
amount of diversification in a focused fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bramwell's eponymous fund, Bramwell Growth, returned an
annual average of 25.6 percent, compared with 24.4 percent for its
large-growth peers, from its August 1994 inception through June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Segalas' Harbor Capital Appreciation rose 20.7 percent a year,
on average, from its December 1987 inception through June 5, versus
16.5 percent for its large-growth peers.
</P>
<P>
   Marsico ran Janus 20 from its March 1988 inception through July
1997, when he left Janus Capital to start his own firm. In that
time, the fund returned 22.5 percent, annualized, versus 16.2
percent for its large-growth group, Morningstar said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jackson started at Prudential Equity in April 1990, it
returned 16.8 percent a year, on average, through June 5, compared
with 15.4 percent for the average large-cap value fund.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will pay for this stock-picking expertise. Sun
America's fund carries a maximum initial sales charge of 5.75
percent. Prudential's fund charges a like load of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Here's a different kind of price tag for a no-load mutual fund.
To buy the new Waterhouse Investors Dow 30 fund, investors are
required to open a brokerage account at Waterhouse Securities, a
discount brokerage firm based in Manhattan, although the account
can be as little as the fund's $1,000 minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``People generally do more than one type of investment,'' said
Frank Petrilli, chief executive of the brokerage's parent,
Waterhouse Investor Services, in explaining the firm's strategy.
``Eventually, they will buy or sell stocks or options and have a
relationship with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund, which became available to investors last month, now
has $14.5 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Why open a brokerage account to buy shares of a no-load fund?
One reason is that there aren't too many Dow funds out there. The
only pure Dow index fund tracked by Morningstar is ASM Index 30,
whose performance has lagged significantly behind the index since
its March 1991 inception. &QL;

HOT NEW ISSUE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL: MOTHERHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Maine, Mass., N.Y., Calif., La., Wash., Ohio)  (mk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JONESBORO, Ark. _ Even in the friendly crowd at an afternoon
coffee, where three generations of women were gathered around a
silver punch bowl, talking politics in between bites of ham roll,
the Senate candidate Blanche Lambert Lincoln heard the usual
question: ``Do you see hubby and the babies at all?''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate smiled and explained, again, how her husband is
really supportive and her 2-year-old twins, Bennett and Reece, are
doing fine. In 1996, just after learning she was having twins, Mrs.
Lincoln announced she would leave the House of Representatives to
be at home full time. Now that she wants to go back to Washington
with a promotion, her mothering has become an issue in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who think she should stay home,'' especially
because she once said that was the plan, said Stephanie Cohen, of
Emily's List, a Democratic group that promotes and finances female
candidates. But as more mothers of young children run for office,
they are finding that the issue cuts both ways with voters, many
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln campaign has done no polling on the motherhood
factor, but the candidate and her staff say they sense a concern
among many voters over how she will juggle her roles. A moderate
Democrat who talks about fraud and waste in government, Mrs.
Lincoln is constantly asked to explain herself as a mother, and
even to provide the details of her child-care arrangements, in a
way that male candidates with young families are not.
</P>
<P>
   But voters seem satisfied once they hear the specifics of her
plans, which involves moving her family en masse to Washington,
where her physician-husband will relocate his practice, she said.
And the fact that she has children seems to be helping her more
than it is hurting, according to political handicappers.
</P>
<P>
   She easily beat Winston Bryant, the Arkansas attorney general,
winning 63 percent of the vote in a Tuesday runoff, and is widely
expected to win in the fall over the Republican candidate, Fay
Boozman. At the same recent party where she was asked when she sees
her family, another woman gave Mrs. Lincoln a hug and said: ``From
one mother to another, I'm so glad you're running. That's why I
want you there.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the criticism of Mrs. Lincoln's candidacy seems to
come from older women, younger women tend to identify with Mrs.
Lincoln _ and love the idea that she could spend a couple of years
at home and then go back to work as a U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   She has made her children a focal point of the campaign. She
carries her brag book of snapshots with her at all times. A
television commercial shows her in various maternal poses,
overseeing mealtime, balancing one child on her hip, bouncing one
on her knee, and then, perhaps in need of rest, laying her head on
the shoulder of her husband, Steve Lincoln, a fertility doctor.
(``Daughter, wife, mother, congresswoman,'' the voice-over says.
``Living our rock-solid Arkansas values.'') On a recent day spent
campaigning, Mrs. Lincoln received dozens of neighborly queries
about her children, and few other questions.
</P>
<P>
   Her hostess at the coffee, Martha Wall, an elegant 79-year-old
whom Mrs. Lincoln described in a whisper as `a quintessential steel
magnolia,'' said that she, for one, did not question Mrs. Lincoln's
ambitions. ``I never liked housekeeping that much myself,'' Mrs.
Wall said with a small smile.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, women have entered politics relatively late in
life, as did former Rep. Millicent Fenwick of New Jersey and former
Sen. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine. Only in about the last five
years have significant numbers of women like Mrs. Lincoln, who is
37, begun running for office while still of childbearing age, said
Elizabeth Sherman, director of the Center for Women in Politics and
Public Policy at the McCormack Institute at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   While the hot-button topic of a mother's place in the workplace
is being played out in every profession, politics is the only one
in which the general public gets to vote on the outcome. And though
no race can be seen as a direct referendum on the issue, recent
elections do suggest that mothers on the stump often stir intense
interest and debate, yet motherhood in itself appears to be no
barrier to a political career, even when the candidate's children
are small. ``So many women with young kids are working,'' Ms.
Sherman said, ``that voters can relate.''
</P>
<P>
   When the late Sonny Bono's mother said her 7- and 10-year-old
grandchildren ``would essentially become orphans open to abuse by
strangers'' if her daughter-in-law, Mary Bono, was elected to fill
his congressional seat, the uproar that followed ultimately created
a backlash that worked in Mary Bono's favor. She won an April
special election with 64 percent of the vote over the Democrat,
Ralph Waite, the actor who once played the patriarch on TV's ``The
Waltons.''
</P>
<P>
   After former Rep. Susan Molinari, a New York Republican turned
television commentator, gave birth in 1996, she was accused of
using her daughter, Susan Ruby, as a family-friendly prop, and
criticized for keeping her up late to hear mother speak at the
Republican convention. (And what was that clear liquid Grandpa was
feeding her when the cameras cut to him?) But the premise of the
criticism is that voters respond favorably to seeing an elected
official with her baby. And Ms. Molinari's seat, even in a
conservative district, was presumably hers for life until she gave
it up for television.
</P>
<P>
   There are 15 mothers with children who are school-age or younger
in Congress, compared with just one as recently as six years ago.
In 1974, Yvonne Braithwaite Burke of California became the first
member of Congress to give birth while in office. But in the last
few years, there has been something of a congressional baby
boomlet, beginning in 1995, with Enid Greene, a Utah Republican who
was only the second congresswoman to give birth. Molinari and Mrs.
Lincoln had children in 1996, and last year, Sen. Mary Landrieu,
D-La., adopted a baby.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Patricia Schroeder, the Colorado Democrat, said that
when she was elected to the House in 1972, when her children were
ages 2 and 6, ``Even Bella Abzug called me when I won and said, `I
don't know how you're going to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., was elected
after campaigning as ``a mom in tennis shoes.'' She ignored
advisers who warned her to soft-pedal the fact that she had
children, arguing that she was running because of her 12- and
15-year-old children, not in spite of them. Female candidates now
routinely play up their domestic experience.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a Democrat running for Congress in Ohio,
says she talks about her eighth-grade son every chance she gets.
``It seems to be a plus that here's a working mother,'' Mrs. Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day spent campaigning, Mrs. Lincoln prompted those
few who did not ask about her boys: ``Have y'all seen my babies?''
</P>
<P>
   At the Randolph County Courthouse, Mrs. Lincoln received the
star treatment from the mostly female employees, who obviously
liked her _ and seemed to appreciate the Hollywood-style storyline
of her life: A farmer's daughter, Mrs. Lincoln worked at
secretarial jobs and later became a Washington lobbyist before
beating Rep. Bill Alexander, for whom she had worked as a
receptionist, in her first race at age 31. (She recalls that when
she told her old boss she was running, he laughed and said, ``Why
not run for the Senate?'')
</P>
<P>
   The female clerks repeatedly told her they were ``so proud'' of
her, and she more than returned the favor, thanking them for
keeping the machinery of local government cranking.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Mrs. Lincoln said, she is a traditional woman, a
wife who ``always just expected to take my husband's name.'' But
she says she felt isolated at home, and quit Congress two years ago
mostly because she worried about campaigning in the heat of an
Arkansas summer during a high-risk pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   None of her opponents has been critical of her comeback, though
she suggests that a fellow Democrat, Scott Ferguson, a West Memphis
radiologist, had raised the issue obliquely by saying that, of all
his titles, ``Dad'' means the most. (Ferguson said he would not
dare. ``My wife is a dentist and we've got a family,'' he said,
adding that he had, however, heard such complaints from voters.)
</P>
<P>
   Her Republican opponent, Dr. Boozman, a 51-year-old eye surgeon
and state senator, best known as the lead sponsor of last year's
state legislation banning the procedure known as partial birth
abortion, does not plan to make her motherhood an issue. Boozman is
a religious conservative who attends the same church as his friend,
Sen. Tim Hutchinson, in their hometown of Rogers, and is generally
considered a long shot in the race.
</P>
<P>
   John Brummett, a columnist for The Arkansas Democrat Gazette,
said, ``You hear people say, `What kind of baloney is this, running
as a family candidate two years after you said you had to leave
Congress because you were having twins?' But generally, having two
gorgeous babies in your TV advertisements works to your benefit.''
Brummett has criticized Mrs. Lincoln for other reasons, saying she
is not on a par with the retiring Democratic senator, Dale Bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just got to believe that John doesn't like women,'' Mrs.
Lincoln said of Brummett.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate herself is not completely uncritical of other
women's decisions on balancing parenting and politics. When asked
about Jane Swift, the pregnant candidate for lieutenant governor in
Massachusetts, Mrs. Lincoln was quiet for a moment, then asked
whether hers was a planned pregnancy. And she assailed Ms.
Molinari's decision to take her baby to a political convention: ``I
don't like to put them in situations that frighten them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Lincoln said she figures the debate about whether women
can simultaneously focus on potty-training and NATO expansion will
go on for some time. ``It's going to be hard for a while,'' she
said, ``until more women begin to support each other in the
different ways we do things.''

HOFFA CONTINUES TO BUILD COALITION IN QUEST TO LEAD THE TEAMSTERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC BRAZIL 
c.1998 San Francisco Examiner 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ With his adversaries in disarray, James P.
Hoffa looks vastly more relaxed and confident these days than
during his first fractious run for the Teamsters Union presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of attacking Ron Carey, who edged him in a tainted 1996
election that has since been voided, Hoffa is talking unity as he
stumps the country in an effort to win the office his father, James
R. Hoffa, held for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This union can never be great again as long as it's totally
divided,'' Hoffa said Thursday between bites of a bran muffin at a
diner in Berkeley. ``People everywhere want to end the infighting
so that we can rededicate ourselves to delivering for our
members.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 campaign for the presidency of the 1.4 million-member
Teamsters was memorably nasty. Carey defeated Hoffa by 4 percentage
points, but his victory was overturned by federal oversight
officials, who said Carey participated in a plan to divert union
funds to his campaign treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, a lawyer, has been campaigning nonstop for the Teamsters
presidency for the better part of four years. ``I've shaken more
hands than my father ever did,'' he said. Hoffa claims to have won
over the leaders of more than a dozen Teamsters locals who
supported Carey for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have switched is Mike McLaughlin, secretary
treasurer of Local 856 in San Francisco. ``Hoffa wants to end the
divisions that have really hurt us,'' McLaughlin said. ``He will
recognize the fact that we've made reforms here, and he's given us
his assurance that he supports us. We've just got to end the
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa continues to hammer the Carey administration for draining
the treasury of the nation's biggest private-sector union. Carey's
reformers ``give reform a bad name ... They were deficit spending
for five years, and that's why we're in a financial shambles, on
the verge of bankruptcy, at rock bottom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots will be mailed to Teamsters members Sept. 14 and voting
will begin Oct. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa is seen as the front-runner against Tom Leedham, who is
head of a Teamsters local in Portland, Ore.

   MARKETS
</P>
<P>
   Charging Into Reverse
</P>
<P>
   No one else has had the power to move markets in recent years
the way Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has. With the
merest hint that the central bank might need to take aim at
inflation, the markets ducked for cover.
</P>
<P>
   But last week he signaled to investors that he saw no immediate
need to strike against inflation by raising interest rates, telling
the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that ``the current
economic performance, with its combination of strong growth and low
inflation, is as impressive as any I have witnessed in my near
half-century of daily observation of the American economy.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened on Wall Street? The stock market ducked for
cover. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 8,834.94,
down 202.77 points. But the bond market surged, sending government
bond yields to their lowest levels in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   THE ECONOMY
</P>
<P>
   Retail Sales Climb &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index rose 0.2
percent in May, reflecting higher prices for energy and
prescription drugs. That followed an identical increase in April.
... With an assist from the strongest new-car sales in 15 months,
retail sales rose a stronger-than-expected 0.9 percent last month,
to a seasonally adjusted $224.62 billion, the Commerce Department
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The gain, the seventh in a row, exceeded private economists'
forecasts of a rise of 0.7 percent. ... If a bill passed by the
House becomes law, retailers may even be paid for all those sales.
The bankruptcy laws would be tightened, making it far more
difficult to buy now and escape paying later.
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO
</P>
<P>
   A Bill (and Its Largess) Advance
</P>
<P>
   If a middle-income husband and wife both smoke, their outlook is
win some, lose some, financially at least. Employing a certain
inside-the-Beltway logic, the Senate voted to use part of the money
that would be raised from higher cigarette prices to give an
income-tax break to married couples with annual incomes below
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was billed as fighting the income tax code's
marriage penalty; the vote gave additional strength to anti-smoking
legislation that has been before the Senate for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also voted to use some of the cigarette money on
drug-abuse programs. ... In a setback to the tobacco industry, a
Florida jury found Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco liable for a smoker's
death and ordered the company to pay $1 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   AUTOS
</P>
<P>
   At GM, Strikes and Layoffs
</P>
<P>
   Angry over what they called unmet demands for job security,
hundreds of striking workers chanted ``U.A.W.!'' and toted red
placards at the gate of a General Motors spark-plug factory in
Flint, Mich., joining striking workers from a metal-stamping
factory.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly bitter fight could lead GM, the world's largest
auto maker, to close most of its North American assembly plants
within days. GM has already closed seven assembly plants and
temporarily laid off 18,600 workers for lack of parts, and it could
temporarily lay off up to 200,000 more workers. ... Honda and Ford
endured a multimillion-dollar embarrassment, agreeing to pay
millions of dollars in federal fines for selling cars that were
designed to pass emissions tests but were certain to run
substantially dirtier on the road.
</P>
<P>
   THE FDA
</P>
<P>
   Taking Aim at Supplements
</P>
<P>
   In a case to be heard Monday in federal court in Salt Lake City,
the Food and Drug Administration is waging a pivotal battle against
the fast-growing dietary supplement industry, which is not subject
to the same rigorous requirements for scientific testing as the
drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is Chinese red yeast sold in this country by Pharmanex
under the name Cholestin to lower cholesterol. The FDA calls the
product, which is sold in both health food outlets and the giant
Wal-Mart chain, an illegal, unapproved drug because it contains an
ingredient, lovastatin, that is the key component of the
cholesterol-lowering drug Mevacor, made by Merck.
</P>
<P>
   COMPANIES
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sues Intel
</P>
<P>
   The FTC filed antitrust charges against the chip maker, accusing
it of threatening and injuring three computer makers, including
Compaq, the leading maker of personal computers, to coerce them to
turn over rights to patented technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Intel disagreed. ... Boeing said it would cut production of its
wide-body 747 aircraft next year because of slow growth in Asia.
And the company said that starting this year it would eliminate
more jobs than the 12,000 previously announced. ... Nabisco
announced a $524 million reorganization plan that will include
factory closings and the layoffs of more than 3,000 of its 53,000
employees. ... Controversy swirled around a $42 million golden
parachute that William Catacosinos received as New York state
partly took over Long Island Lighting Co., the troubled utility he
led. He is now chief executive of Marketspan, the successor
company.
</P>
<P>
   BANKS
</P>
<P>
   Deal After Deal
</P>
<P>
   Norwest and Wells Fargo agreed to a $34 billion merger, the
latest in a string of blockbuster unions that have created a cadre
of giants and a few dozen also-rans in the once-sleepy banking
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The banks' merger frenzy has been driven by stalled revenue
growth and heightened competition from mutual funds, brokerage
firms and credit card companies. ... Credit Suisse First Boston
bought Brazil's leading investment bank, Garantia SA, for $675
million, making the Swiss-American group the largest underwriter
and stock trader in that hotly competitive emerging market.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA
</P>
<P>
   A Warning From the IMF
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has told the Russian government that it needs to slash
its budget deficit and overhaul its antiquated tax system if it is
to qualify for billions of dollars in extra loans, senior Russian
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fund officials also want Russia to strengthen its banking system
and have suggested that the operations of Gazprom, the huge natural
gas monopoly, be split up. In one move aimed at improving its tax
picture, the Russian government arrested the head of the state
committee for statistics, Yuri Yurkov, and his top deputies and
accused them of manipulating data to help Russian companies avoid
taxes. Adding to the unrest, miners from the Vorkuta region, who
have not been paid in four months, protested in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ASIA
</P>
<P>
   A Pervasive Gloom
</P>
<P>
   Asia's financial crisis appears to be turning into the most
serious region-wide recession since the end of World War II,
leaving investors throughout Asia as deflated as these two Tokyo
currency traders.
</P>
<P>
   Japan announced its first year of economic contraction since
1974, confirming that it is in a severe recession. Gross domestic
product for the fiscal year ended March 31 shrank by 0.7 percent;
for the January-March quarter the shrinkage was 1.3 percent,
following a 0.4 percent drop in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia have all confirmed that their
economies shrank in the first quarter and are likely to keep
contracting, and South Korea and Thailand are also in retreat. The
culprit in the latest slide is the Japanese yen, which has fallen
to an eight-year low against the American dollar, ending the week
at 144.72, with predictions it could drop further. Stock markets
throughout Asia have plunged along with the yen, with Bangkok's
market at its lowest level in 10 years. &QL;

SILVER CHARM RETURNS TO ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One week after the Triple Crown series ended in a classic finish
in the Belmont Stakes, older horses will follow the 3-year-olds
into the spotlight Saturday: Silver Charm returns to action at
Churchill Downs in the $750,000 Stephen Foster Handicap, and Ordway
and Behrens are among a full field of 13 in the $300,000 Brooklyn
Handicap at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, who won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness last
year, returns at age 4 with a three-race winning streak that he
capped in March with the $4 million Dubai World Cup. In the Stephen
Foster, he will face six rivals, including his stablemate Semoran
and Awesome Again, who won the Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga last
August.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, who has finished first or second in all 13 of his
starts, has been made the 3-5 favorite even though he is giving
away 12 to 18 pounds for the mile and an eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have him cranked up full steam,'' said his
trainer, Bob Baffert, speaking from his barn at Churchill Downs in
Louisville, Ky. ``But win, lose or draw, he's going to get a good
race out of it. I don't expect him to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   At Belmont Park, two comeback campaigns and a purse of $300,000
will be riding on the outcome of the Brooklyn Handicap, the middle
race in New York's Handicap Triple for older horses. The series
opened on May 25 with the Metropolitan Mile, which was won by Wild
Rush, who was not nominated for the Brooklyn. The third and final
event is the Suburban Handicap on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback horses are Ordway and Behrens, a pair of
4-year-olds whose careers have taken detours. Ordway looked like a
Kentucky Derby contender last year, running second in the Gotham
and fourth in the Wood Memorial. But he came down with an infection
and missed most of the summer. Last month, he raced for the first
time in six months and won an allowance race on Belmont Park's
opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go out looking for Skip Away or Silver Charm
because Ordway isn't up to that,'' said his trainer, David Donk.
``But this could be another good step on his road back.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens is not looking for Skip Away or Silver Charm, either; in
his last four starts, he has been outrun by one champion or the
other. After winning the Pegasus last September, he ran seventh to
Skip Away in the Breeders' Cup Classic, seventh to Skip Away in the
Donn, third to Skip Away in the Gulfstream Park Handicap and fifth
to Silver Charm in the Dubai World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But Behrens and Ordway should get plenty of action from Frisk Me
Now, the favorite, and Acceptable, Sir Bear and Subordination. &QL;

ONCE A HIPPIE HAVEN, HAIGHT STREET STRUGGLES WITH GUTTER PUNKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional trim) 
 
By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU 
c.1998 San Francisco Examiner 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ All is not lovey-dovey on Haight Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Summer of Love is now the summer of discontent. The rebels
and the followers, the drifters and the grifters, the potheads and
the Deadheads, the dreamers and the losers are still hanging out on
the street, just as they did decades ago, when Haight-Ashbury was a
symbol of '60s counter-culture, a mecca for disconnected youth and
gawking tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, it was long-haired hippies with love beads against
their tie-dyed shirts and flowers in their hair. These days, it's
mostly gutter punks with studded jackets and studded tongues. But
more than the faces and outfits have changed. So have attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   To many merchants and residents, the famous Haight-Ashbury scene
is getting old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had it,`` said Uti Kaupp, 50, owner of Piedmont
Boutique, a costume shop for dancers and performers, who has lived
and worked on Haight Street since 1981. ``People can't walk down
the streets anymore ... The neighborhood people are crying for
help.''
</P>
<P>
   This week came the last straw. Four young blacks and a baby were
attacked by a group of about a dozen young white men, the police
said. At least one white man reportedly yelled racial epithets. He
has been arrested and charged with a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a hate crime in the Haight, where the ideals of
love, peace and brotherhood put the neighborhood on the map, has
freaked out many of the grown-ups with jobs and homes. To them, the
incident further proves that Haight Street is falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Signs in many storefronts Thursday pronounced, ``The Haight Says
No to Hate.'' The Anti-Defamation League has called for a community
forum on hate in the Haight to be held next week.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, with the closing of nearby Golden Gate Park to
homeless encampments, the situation seems to have gotten worse,
with many of the young people who used to live in the park spilling
onto Haight Street.
</P>
<P>
   They sprawl on curbs and corners. They block doors and window
displays. Many, with greasy hair and dirty fingernails, look like
they haven't showered in days, if that. Some admit that they
urinate and defecate on the street. A number of the street dwellers
have dogs, many of them pit bulls.
</P>
<P>
   To the baby boomers who have been snapping up the neighborhood's
Victorian- and Edwardian-style homes at $600,000 per flat and $1
million-plus per house, the scene is a bad trip. Many said they do
not shop on Haight Street, just to avoid the hassle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten dirtier, it's gotten scummier,'' said Duane
Helmer, 40, who moved to the neighborhood two years ago and does
not take his 10-year-old son to Haight Street anymore. ``There's
more people with an attitude of `This is my sidewalk. Get out of my
face.'''
</P>
<P>
   Merchants say business is hurting because fewer residents shop
at their businesses. Last year, the street's only bank, pharmacy
and copy center closed.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Khuri, 34, owner of the Blue Front Cafe off Masonic Street,
said sales at his restaurant are off 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody from the neighborhood hangs out on Haight Street
anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist trade also seems down, Khuri said. ``People want to
come to see the hippies,'' he said, ``not the bums.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The seeming prevalence of drugs is a big turn-off. Walk down any
block along Haight Street and the chant of ``Need any buds?''
follows.
</P>
<P>
   One Deadhead named Michael, 24, said he makes $200 a day selling
pot on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Heroin and speed also ARE big sellers. Twice a month, Khuri
said, he must call a plumbing service because needles are clogging
the sink and toilet of his restaurant's bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roto-Rooter, I'm telling you,'' Khuri said, ``is doing good
business on Haight Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents and merchants are divided about what to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Haight Ashbury Neighborhood Coalition believes there should
be more counseling for children to get them off the street. On the
opposite end of the spectrum, RAD, formerly Residents Against
Druggies, wants a police crackdown to keep vagrants from loitering
and selling drugs. The group has patrols that walk the neighborhood
to intimidate drug dealers. The patrols carry radios to communicate
with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many residents and merchants complain about the
street scene, many stores capitalize on the memory of the
psychedelic '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Head shops, vintage clothing stores and tie-dyed shirt places
abound. Gift shops sell everything from mushroom-shaped rainbow
candles to troll dolls wearing necklaces with peace signs. Roberts
Hardware has lava lamps in the window.
</P>
<P>
   The people who call the street home said the mystique of the
Haight Street of yesteryear, mirrored in these shop windows, is
part of the attraction for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the past that draws them here,'' said Jason Metz, 22, who
grew up in the Haight and spent some time on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to experience the vibes here,'' said Hunt, who left
Chicago two months ago. ``I heard it was good people, where nobody
was judged, where everybody gets along.''
</P>

`BLOO REVIEW': A MERRY RETURN TO MUSIC HALL
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By PETER MARKS     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ That husky warble, those hairy legs! He absolutely is
Lady Bracknell.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Bette Bourne, the gentle heart and soul of Bloolips, the
illustrious British drag troupe, rides the Oscar Wilde popularity
wave in ``Bloo Review,'' the company's charmingly ditzy new show at
Theater for the New City. Rigidly upright in a chair, as imperious
an actress as one of those grandes dames of yore, Bette performs a
scene from ``The Importance of Being Earnest'' with an almost
terrifying technical dexterity.
</P>
<P>
   Bette is, in fact, Edith Evans on a male hormone regimen. ``Do
you smoke? I'm glad to hear it,'' Bette says, the consonants
enunciated so crisply each sounds as if it could snap. ``A man
should have an occupation of some kind.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bloo Review,'' the scene from ``Earnest'' counts as
highbrow theater. In inimitable Bloolips fashion, the show is a
merry return to the music hall, albeit a daintier music hall than
the one in which Archie Rice gallivanted in ``The Entertainer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you normally work in shifts?'' Bette purrs to the evening's
co-star, Precious Pearl (the actor Paul Shaw).
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I usually find them more comfortable,'' hisses Pearl.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a return to material Bloolips has performed before.
(Thus the evening's subtitle, ``A Bloolips Retrospectacle.'') The
comedy, intermingled with musical numbers evoking Noel Coward's
London of the 1940s and '50s, is all in an extremely loopy vein.
That Bette and Precious Pearl begin and end the show as chickens
and eggs (hatchlings for the opening; sunny side up for the finale)
should give some sense of the silliness quotient.
</P>
<P>
   You can see in the harmless lampoons by Bloolips, which over the
years has developed a loyal following in New York, the inspiration
for Howard Crabtree's drag productions. Irony is kept to a blessed
minimum. Some of the best gags fly on the flimsiest premises, as,
for instance, when Bette, with the help of his dressers, suits up
as Marie Antoinette to the strains of the 1812 Overture.
</P>
<P>
   A spoof of ``Brief Encounter'' in which a problem in a nasal
passage leads to romance, is a high point, as is the rendition of a
signature Bloolips song, ``Why Must the Frock Go On?,'' which
features Bette in a batwing-sleeved dress fringed with tea
strainers.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few lulls in the evening; occasional jokes and skits
targeting Prime Minister Tony Blair don't have much oomph. Still,
few troupes make playing dress-up such an agreeable cabaret.
</P>

EVEN INTIMIDATOR GLAD TO RIDE ALONG IN ESPN'S COMMERCIALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt is not known as the Man in Black for nothing.
There are those who say the nickname is perfect for a man of his
disposition.
</P>
<P>
   But when ESPN called last year and asked him to appear in a TV
commercial with a dog, NASCAR's most prominent driver jumped at the
chance. The next thing you know, Earnhardt's heading into Turn 1
with a pooch in the back seat sticking its pointy head out the
window to catch some 180-mph breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt playing straight man to a mutt?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of Winston Cup drivers are proud to be the middle man in
the joke, it seems, so long as it's part of ESPN's ``ride-along''
advertising campaign that promotes their circuit. Now in its second
year, the spots feature racers with ballplayers, racers with
cabbies, even racers with iguanas. All ride along in the back seat
and trade oddball dialogue with the drivers who do their best not
to crack up _ as they try not to crack up.
</P>
<P>
   There's Jeff Gordon, another driver not exactly known for his
whimsical side, being told by a New York City taxi driver that
trolling the mean streets of the Bronx, at night, is a lot scarier
way to make a living than tempting the wall at Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   There's Kyle Petty getting the full back-seat driver treatment
from his old man, who, in this case, happens to be stock-car legend
Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   And there's Mark Martin, in perhaps the funniest spot, trying to
negotiate the corners as New York Jets receiver Keyshawn Johnson
attempts to snag a wayward football pass.
</P>
<P>
   Also performing: Dale Jarrett, Ricky Craven, Terry Labonte and
Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed doing it,'' Jarrett said recently. ``Some of these
kinds of things aren't much fun to do, but ESPN made these fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good time last year doing mine, and this year they
talked my dad into doing one with me,'' Kyle Petty said. ``I like
mine, but I like Mark Martin's best.''
</P>
<P>
   In his solo spot, Petty is practicing some stand-up comic
material while a cheesy drummer sits in the back seat. ``I used to
be a grease monkey,'' Petty deadpans, ``but let me tell you ... it
was the pits.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, the drummer bangs a rim shot. Bah-dum, bum!
</P>
<P>
   As much fun as the participating drivers had making the
commercials (Earnhardt wanted back in for a second spot this
season, but couldn't work it into his schedule), they see a greater
purpose. That's promoting NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the commercials have helped NASCAR quite a bit,''
Jarrett said. ``They help people recognize drivers' faces a little
bit more because they can see us without our helmets on or wearing
an open-faced helmet. It's a big plus for the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace couldn't do an ESPN spot in 1997, the first year
of the campaign, because of other commitments. But when he saw the
commercial work of his fellow competitors, ``he went out of his way
to clear his schedule this year to make sure he could do it,''
Wallace spokesman Tom Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   In one commercial, Wallace engages in a round of barb-tossing
with Baltimore Orioles pitcher Mike Mussina.
</P>
<P>
   Said Wallace: ``It's a neat deal that really helps promote the
sport. It puts us in the mainstream. This is a chance to be an
ambassador for the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude has gone a long way in making stock-car racing the
favorite of motorsports fans.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, which broadcasts NASCAR races as well as weekly feature
programs on motorsports, says the spots have been well-received.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really believe NASCAR is one of the sports, if not the only
sport, where there is a really strong connection between the
(athlete) and the fan. There's an accessibility there we wanted to
capitalize on,'' said Alex Kaminsky, director of advertising and
program marketing for ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Kaminsky said he believes that race fans and novices alike can
relate to the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have thrown a baseball,'' he said. ``We've caught a
down-and-out or made a basket. But how many of us have gotten in a
$250,000 car and driven at 180 miles per hour?''
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Cup drivers chosen for the ESPN commercials didn't
get the chance to pick their ride-along partners, but some racers
had definite ideas of who they would want with them, if given the
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd pick Terry Bradshaw,'' Jarrett said. ``I liked him when he
was playing, and with his competitive nature, I think he'd enjoy
going around as fast as we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty had different ideas, though, perhaps because he has always
had King Richard as a back-seat driver, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably Marcel Marceau,'' Petty said. ``He'd keep his mouth
shut and wouldn't say anything.''

PAKISTAN REJECTS INDIA'S CALL FOR TALKS, BUT CRISIS APPEARS TO
SUBSIDE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ An Indian proposal for talks with Pakistan
later this month on ways of lessening tensions in the Indian
subcontinent was quickly rejected by Pakistan Friday, but the
exchange appeared to have moved both governments closer to direct
negotiations over the crisis set off by the nuclear tests that both
conducted last month.
</P>
<P>
   While New Delhi and Islamabad were testing each other out over
possible talks, a new sense of urgency developed as a result of
decisions made Friday in London at a meeting of foreign ministers
of the United States and seven other industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers of the eight nations announced that they
would act together to postpone loans for everything but ``basic
human needs'' by major international financial institutions,
including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank. ``We agree to support postponement of
consideration of other loans by the international financial
institutions,'' the foreign ministers said in a statement. They did
not say how long a postponement they had in mind, however. The
length of any delay has been the subject of disagreement by the
Europeans on one hand and the United States, Japan and Canada on
the other. United States law sets no limits on postponement.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan had both hoped the United States would be
isolated in its bid to cut off loans to the two nations by the
international institutions, a step President Clinton included in
the package of sanctions he imposed on India after its first series
of nuclear tests on May 11, and in the identical sanctions on
Pakistan he announced after Islamabad's initial test series on May
28.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the United States has the power to delay, but not to
halt, billions of dollars of loans that are crucial to development
in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's decision in London, Indian and Pakistani analysts
noted that the eight countries represented at the meeting have more
than 50 per cent of the voting power at the IMF and the World Bank,
enough to block loans and inflict major damage on the economies of
both countries. But there are few people in either country who
believe that economic pressure, however severe, is likely to
achieve the ultimate objective stated by the nations that met in
London: forcing India and Pakistan to sign existing nuclear
limitation treaties and to abandon plans to develop arsenals of
nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, the prime ministers of the two countries,
Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India and Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, have
both said that they favored negotiations on nuclear weapons and
other issues. But when India made a formal proposal Friday that
senior officials open a dialogue on June 22 in New Delhi, India's
capital, Pakistan promptly rejected the proposal, calling it ``the
traditional gimmickry of Indian diplomacy.'' Instead, Pakistan
suggested the talks begin in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, on June
20.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection reflected differences between the two governments
over the agenda for the negotiations, in particular over the
procedures for discussing the highly-charged issue of Kashmir. But
western diplomats and officials in both capitals said the
significance of the day's exchanges lay less in that maneuvering
than in the fact that both governments had signaled that they
wanted talks to begin soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all that's happened, you'd have to expect that they'd
play cat-and-mouse,'' a western envoy in New Delhi said. ``But it's
clear that both sides recognize the need to start talking about
nuclear weapons, and to do it soon, for their own sake and to show
the world they understand the seriousness of the issues involved.''
</P>
<P>
   A clearer indication of how far New Delhi and Islamabad are
prepared to go in restraining a nuclear arms race is likely to
emerge when they begin talks. Although Friday's efforts to schedule
talks proved abortive, there were signs that Vajpayee and Sharif
were already looking beyond talks at the level of officials to a
possible summit meeting in early July, when government leaders of
seven South Asian nations are to gather for an annual summit
meeting in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital.
</P>
<P>
   Dates for the regional meeting have been up in the air since the
nuclear tests, with doubts whether the Indian and Pakistani leaders
would attend, and if they did, whether they would meet. But western
diplomats said they were told by the Indian foreign ministry Friday
that the Colombo meeting was likely to take place between July 9
and 12, and that Vajpayee and Sharif were likely to meet during
that period.
</P>
<P>
   The talks that the two governments jockeyed over in public
Friday would be held at the level of their foreign secretaries, the
top diplomats in their respective foreign ministries. Talks at this
level were resumed last year after a gap of several years, but
lapsed in September when the two sides were unable to agree on a
formula for discussing Kashmir, the disputed territory that has
been at the core of enmities between them since the partition of
the sub-continent in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In its proposal for talks Friday, India suggested that the talks
resume in New Delhi on the basis of proposals put forward by India,
and rejected by Pakistan, in January. Although the Indian proposals
provided for discussions on Kashmir, as demanded by Pakistan, India
wanted these to be subsumed in broader talks on peace and security
in the subcontinent, and not in a separate working group as favored
by Pakistan. It was this difference that Pakistan cited Friday in
rejecting the Indian proposal for resuming the talks.
</P>
<P>
   When the two nations do meet, their discussions on nuclear
weapons are likely to focus on several proposals including a formal
agreement not to conduct any further tests, a step both governments
have said they are ready to take; a non-aggression pact, a proposal
put forward by Pakistan that India has said it will consider; and a
commitment by both nations not to be the the first to use nuclear
weapons, an idea favored by India but not by Pakistan, which has
said that it regards a nuclear arsenal as a counterweight to
India's large advantage in conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   But Pakistan has said that it will not abandon plans to develop
a nuclear arsenal, as demanded by the United States and the other
nations that met Friday in London, unless India abandons its
arsenal; and India has said that the only circumstance under which
it will forgo the development of nuclear arms is if the established
nuclear powers, Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States, agree to eliminate their own arsenals, something all five
have rejected.

   CLINTON-OCEANS (Monterey, Calif.) _ Clinton, navigating a narrow
course between environmentalists and oil companies, announced on
Friday a 10-year extension on the current moratorium on oil
drilling off virtually all American coastlines. Clinton also placed
several existing marine sanctuaries permanently off-limits to oil
exploration. The moratorium does not, however, affect the extensive
drilling activity off the Texas and Louisiana Coast, nor does it
protect any new areas not already covered by the drilling ban first
imposed by President Bush in 1990. By John M. Broder.

COMMENTARY: TRASH THE IMF! 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Precede should be italicized) 
(bl) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently several prominent former officials and economists have
called for abolishing the International Monetary Fund. Congress is
also holding back its next deposit to the fund, $18 billion,
because a Republican congressman, Chris Smith, won't allow the U.S.
contribution to be made unless the Clinton administration drops
support for any worldwide family-planning program that includes
abortions. Since all these smart people seem to think the world
doesn't need the IMF, I say junk the place. Here's what the world
would look like a year later.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 13, 1999 _ On the first anniversary of the
closing of the IMF, the Russian ruble hit a new low today of 50,000
to the dollar. Russia's president, the former army general
Alexander Lebed, who ousted Boris Yeltsin in a coup after the
Russian economy collapsed six months ago, announced a new export
program for getting Russia's economy back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``From today forward,'' said President Lebed, ``any Russian
company capable of exporting any device, technology, weapons system
or natural resource _ including highly enriched uranium _ is
encouraged to do so to anyone who can pay hard currency. The U.S.
Congress says it will sanction us for selling nuclear technology to
Iran or India. Hah! What more can they do? Since they closed the
IMF, 35 percent of Russia is unemployed. The Russian army has not
been paid in six months. How's that for a moral hazard!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the former U.S. allies Korea and Thailand, with their
economies in a tailspin from the lack of IMF support, decided to go
to the only other potential lender of last resort _ the U.S.
Congress. Korea's president, Kim Dae-jung, told Congress: ``We have
been loyal U.S. allies for 40 years. I am the first liberal
democrat elected President of Korea. All my years as a political
exile, America was my model. You're not going to abandon me now?
With 30,000 U.S. troops in my country and North Korea up there with
a bomb in the basement?''
</P>
<P>
   The Koreans have enlisted two former U.S. Treasury secretaries,
George Shultz and William Simon, along with the former Citibank
chief Walter Wriston, to lobby Congress for an emergency $10
billion aid package for Seoul. Unlike IMF bailouts _ where the
burden is shared by many countries _ this Korean bailout will have
to be a direct loan from the United States to Korea, with America
bearing all the risks and costs alone.
</P>
<P>
   That loan was jeopardized yesterday, though, when the U.S.
Embassy in Seoul was ransacked, along with the Coke and Pepsi
bottling plants, by an angry Korean mob. The mob was outraged by
the conditions that the U.S. Congress wanted to impose on Korea in
exchange for U.S. help: an end to all birth control in Korea and
the right for any U.S. company to buy 100 percent of any Korean
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad we don't have the IMF around to impose these
conditions, so everyone could blame it instead of us,'' mused House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, in a rare moment of candor.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Asia, human rights activists were appalled as
Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia all declared martial law so their
governments could close down newspapers and stop rioting against
businesses owned by ethnic Chinese, who tend to dominate Southeast
Asia's economies. China warned that if the anti-Chinese rioting was
not halted, China's navy would ``not stand idle.``
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad denounced
the IMF's closure as yet another conspiracy to weaken Southeast
Asia, mounted by ``the global Merchants of Venice _ and you know
who I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   America's trade deficit hit an all-time high of $400 billion, as
cheap exports from all over Asia's battered economies flooded the
United States. The Dow fell again today, to 6,660, as the dollar
hit 300 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS Poll showed two
nativist-protectionists, Patrick Buchanan and Ross Perot, running
neck and neck in the year 2000 presidential race, after Al Gore and
George W. Bush both dropped out because of lack of support.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the United States called for an emergency meeting of
the world's leading industrial nations to try to establish some
sort of international monetary fund to deal with the crisis.
America offered to hold the meeting in a quiet estate in New
Hampshire called Bretton Woods, but the other world powers, showing
contempt for weak U.S. leadership, insisted on Shanghai. &QL;

COMMENTARY: CLASS OF '98 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last term of high school, as I remember it from the first
time around, is one steady flooring of the accelerator pedal.
Grades don't count, exams don't count, the college that's accepted
you can't change its mind.
</P>
<P>
   In my particular senior year, ``Sgt. Pepper'' had just hit town,
the drinking age was 18 and everyone had a driver's license. By
both shaking and stirring these ingredients, my friends and I were
able to float for weeks, it seemed, from one backyard party to
another until finally we stayed still just long enough to slip into
our rented tuxedos, pick up our corsages and find our way to our
dates and the prom.
</P>
<P>
   After that we drove all night to the beach, though how we then
crept back to our Washington graduation from Ocean City, tired and
sunburned but no wiser, I don't precisely recall. Lucy was always
in the sky with diamonds that endless June, and she was blinding.
</P>
<P>
   The second time around, high school graduation has a different
effect. As I have watched my first son float through his spring
term of senior year, I don't begrudge him his dawning recognition
that school is out even before it officially is; he's earned the
right to coast. And I would have hated myself in the morning if I
had hypocritically applied a curfew to his late spring nights. But
graduation, which could not come fast enough when I was 18, arrives
far too quickly now that he's 18. Instead of accelerating, a father
wants to slam on the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Friends talk about the horror of turning 50, an indignity that
apparently requires you to crawl into a dark psychic cave for
several months and then emerge reading Gail Sheehy books, but I
can't imagine how it could be worse than a first child's
leave-taking. After those years of secretly fantasizing that it
might be a breather to have at least one child out of the house,
especially an adolescent male child, I want to bar the door.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the end of the so-called ``college-application
process'' _ a misnomer for ``college-application torture'' _ that I
realized why it had filled me with such anxiety. My fear wasn't
that my son would fail to get into whatever school he wanted (not
that he was going to choose what school he wanted until the last
possible minute anyway, thank you very much), but that he WOULD get
into that school. The moment the admissions letters went out was
the moment he was truly out the door _ not to an indeterminate
friend's house from which he'd certainly return (however tardily),
but to the humbling realm of adulthood that will be his permanent
new home.
</P>
<P>
   Unselfishly as well as selfishly, I wanted him to cling to
senior year forever. He was safe and happy there, and I, as I now
realize, was safe and happy there too.
</P>
<P>
   My friends John and Nan have tried to cheer me up. Their
daughter, a year older than my son, is at the same college he'll be
going to in the fall. It's not that far, they keep reminding me,
and we can all drive up together on a weekend and take our kids out
to dinner. Having only boys, I can't speak about daughters, but I
remember what I was like in college; dinner with my parents if they
happened to drop into town was not much higher on my list of
priorities than folding laundry. I had my own life now.
</P>
<P>
   These June mornings I wake up to the radio, on which my favorite
talk-show monologuist, a few years older than I am, talks about the
joys of incipient second fatherhood: he has a new baby due any
minute. I fantasize: Could I start at the beginning again and
simply fill the empty place in my nest? Then I get out of bed, and
flash back to the hospital where my son was born, to the nights of
formula, the days of strollers. I face reality: I'm just not one of
those people who can turn back the clock.
</P>
<P>
   So I anticipate instead the world that's going to open wide for
my son in the fall, and imagine it excitedly through his eyes. I
take the pictures of him in his rented prom tux _ far slicker than
his Dad's _ to the drug store to be developed. I dote on my younger
boy, still with all of high school ahead of him and too much the
forgotten soldier of his brother's graduation week. I remind myself
as well that it's still only June, and that there's a whole summer
to come before my son decamps to college.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if I've learned anything at all in those many years
between my high school graduation and his, it's that the summer
goes by so fast. &QL;

 By DOUGLAS MARTIN     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Earlier this week, a well-dressed couple stood on the
edge of the newly restored Great Lawn in Central Park, the lush
bluegrass tickling their ankles. They had rolled aside the
four-foot-high fence to enter.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Hernandez brought her golf cart to a halt, smiled broadly,
and announced: ``Excuse me, the lawn is closed right now. It opens
at 11.''
</P>
<P>
   What? The man fumed that this was ludicrous. The woman said the
golf cart, the fence and the grass fetish made one of the world's
greatest urban parks seem hopelessly suburban.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hernandez, 45, who has calloused hands and a lot of silver
bracelets, nodded cheerfully and began her spiel. ``You have to
understand this is a brand new landscape,'' she said, explaining
how the city had just spent more than $18 million on the
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see,'' said the woman, slightly mollified. ``You have to
baby-sit.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. The Central Park Conservancy, the private group now
responsible for day-to-day management of the park, is determined to
protect the investment in the Great Lawn _ everything from 250
computer-controlled, pop-up sprinklers to more than 2,000 new trees
and shrubs to the centerpiece, 1 million square feet of amazingly
weedless grass _ composed of five different strains of bluegrass.
So it has created a new position with a broad mandate and a
grandiose title: Keeper of the Great Lawn. Ms. Hernandez is the
keeper, and make no mistake, she takes the job very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting the new Great Lawn is particularly important to the
conservancy as a way to demonstrate that it is up to the new
responsibilities it took on in February under a contract with the
city. ``The spotlight is on us to perform _ big-time,'' said Karen
Putnam, the conservancy's president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hernandez's responsibilities include everything that goes on
in the 55-acre Great Lawn area, including the 14-acre Great Oval
that is home to some of the most heavily used ballfields in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of five full-time employees, three summer seasonal
workers and a dozen volunteers, she monitors soil and grass stems,
prunes trees, shovels fertilizer, decides which entrances to open,
oversees restroom repairs, coordinates cultural events like park
appearances by the Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic,
rolls up hundreds of feet of hoses _ and performs at least a
hundred other chores, most daily.
</P>
<P>
   But her most urgent mission is working to educate people on how
to behave in their new emerald paradise: no dogs, no impromptu
ballgames, no bikes, no Rollerblading, no frisbee-throwing by more
than two people. It is thus Ms. Hernandez's job to sell the notion
that the way to enhance and preserve a renewed play space is to
curb the more destructive of people's fun-loving instincts.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy's philosophy is that by providing a familiar
worker in the same space _ 49 gardeners have been assigned to the
park's 49 specific areas _ it can give maintenance and good
behavior a recognizable human face. ``Otherwise it's like an
invisible hand is taking care of the public space,'' Ms. Putnam
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Putnam lauds Ms. Hernandez's ``spectacular integrity'' and
``mythic passion for the park,'' but pays her just $36,000 a year
for what are usually 50-hour weeks. Ms. Hernandez is not in it for
the money. She calls herself ``a Central Park baby,'' having grown
up on the Upper West Side, where she still lives. She studied to
become a chiropractor but went on to work in a variety of jobs from
real-estate management to art restoration to fashion buying.
</P>
<P>
   But gardening became her love. She named her now 21-year-old
daughter Fern, likes to pull weeds in her friends' yards, takes
horticultural courses and volunteers with gardeners at the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
</P>
<P>
   One day seven years ago when she was walking her two dogs
(leashed, of course) in Central Park, she became fascinated
watching a pruner. She applied and was hired as a summer worker.
This led to a job as the gardener for Cedar Hill, a section on the
east side of the park that has long been known as Dog Hill because
of all the unleashed canines.
</P>
<P>
   Partly by bringing her own dogs on a leash, but mostly through
patient explanations of landscape improvements at the hill, she
succeeded in both reclaiming the hill for humans and keeping the
dog people reasonably happy. She also came up with the idea of
displaying red flags when the grass was too soggy for walking _ a
system she has taken to the Great Lawn. And she smiled, sometimes
cajoled, but always smiled again.
</P>
<P>
   One result was an anonymous donation of $5,000 for a bench in
her name at Cedar Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maria's work goes beyond a mere job,'' Parks Commissioner
Henry Stern said. ``It's a calling.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the keeper cannot be tough. Her governing
philosophy: rule with a pot of honey and an iron fist. ``Sometimes
I feel like judge, attorney and hangman, all in one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kasoundra Kasoundra, a volunteer who works in the Great Lawn
three days a week, having followed Ms. Hernandez from Cedar Hill,
said, ``She gets cantankerous when she sees somebody doing
something he shouldn't be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hernandez's joy is helping someone understand the need
to behave differently. She recalls a woman who was walking next to
Turtle Pond when red flags were up. Her dog was paddling in the
water, also a no-no. They talked. ``I went through the whole nine
yards,'' Ms. Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, the woman told the keeper that she had seen
someone doing the same thing. ``I gave her your whole story,'' she
eagerly told Ms. Hernandez. ``I feel so proud of myself.'' &QL;

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 14) 
(af) 
 By NOELLE KNOX    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ugly, the down and out, the beaten up _ these are the stocks
that David N. Dreman, the value investor, loves.
</P>
<P>
   And as you might expect in a rampaging bull market, Dreman's
flagship fund, Kemper-Dreman High Return Equity, has seemed a bit,
well, downtrodden itself lately.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 12 months, the fund has returned 24.1 percent,
compared with 24.6 percent for the average large-value fund,
according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, and
31.9 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Is Dreman, 62, disheartened? Not at all. He is the grand master
of a simple yet psychologically challenging investment strategy:
consummate contrarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Consider tobacco stocks, which fell some 20 percent when the
Clinton administration started negotiating an industry liability
settlement last spring. That is when Dreman started buying Philip
Morris and RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   He has also waded into oil, buying shares of Amoco and Texaco
despite a selloff caused by the current oil glut and tapering
growth in demand. His bet is that the new oil coming from Iraq and
the warmer temperatures created by El Nino are temporary setbacks
for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking a major play, and as always, the value manager
is early,'' Dreman said.
</P>
<P>
   If history is any guide, he may well be right. For the three
years ended June 5, the fund returned an average of 31.9 percent a
year, compared with 24.5 percent for the average large-value fund
and 30.8 percent for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   For the 10-year period, the return was 19.6 percent, compared
with 14.5 percent for peer funds and 18.5 percent for the index.
</P>
<P>
   With a record like that, what's a couple of bad quarters?
</P>
<P>
   Dreman is the chairman and chief investment officer of Dreman
Value Management in Red Bank, N.J.. In addition to the High Return
fund, his firm manages the Kemper-Dreman Financial Services fund,
which opened in March and has $184 million in assets. He also
manages about $2 billion in private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview aboard his yacht, Contrarian, moored near
New York's World Financial Center, Dreman recalled how he was born
to doubt. He was raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the son of a
commodities trader who at 87 is still the patriarch of the Winnipeg
Commodities Exchange. Dreman remembers that his father ``talked a
lot about the research not being right.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreman now makes a lot of money betting against the experts. He
starts with companies with an average capitalization of $15
billion, thus insuring better reporting standards and trading
liquidity. Then he looks at four key measures.
</P>
<P>
   First, he wants a low price-to-earnings ratio _ at least 30
percent lower than the market average, which is currently about 26.
He also compares the ratios with those of other companies in the
same industry to make sure he is not overpaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to have stocks that are really badly sold out,''
Dreman said. The average p/e ratio in his portfolio is 18.7.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he looks for a price-to-book ratio that, again, is at
least 30 percent lower than the market's, which he currently pegs
at 6.1.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Dreman compares the company's stock price with its cash
flow, typically defined as after-tax earnings, adding back
depreciation and other noncash charges. This should also be 30
percent lower than the market's ratio of about 20, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he looks for something that has become an afterthought
for most investors _ high dividends. Before he buys, he wants a a
stock to have a yield at least 50 basis points, or hundredths of a
percentage point, higher than the market's 1.42 percent. And he
looks for a history of rising payouts. Over all, Dreman's fund has
a yield of about 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One of his longest-held stocks is Fannie Mae, the federal
underwriter of home mortgages that has been a standard-bearer of
this bull market. Dreman says that it still fits his model, though
``it's kind of the higher end of our range.''
</P>
<P>
   He started building his position in Fannie Mae in October 1990,
toward the end of the savings and loan crisis, at about $6 a share.
The stock, which closed on Friday at $61.4375, now has a
price-to-earnings ratio of 20.6 and a price-to-book ratio of 4.9.
(Price-to-cash-flow ratios are less meaningful for financial
companies because their capital costs are different from those of
most companies.) The stock yields 1.56 percent, more than 10 basis
points above the market.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent contrarian call is Philip Morris, which the fund
started buying last June at an average price of $40 a share. The
stock closed on Friday at $37.3125, but Dreman likes the company's
price-to-earnings ratio of 15.1, its price-to-book ratio of 5.9,
its price-to-cash-flow ratio of 10.8 and its yield of 4.29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He does not set price targets, but predicts that if the market
keeps rising over the next 12 months, Philip Morris will outperform
it by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   His other big contrarian play is oil. His largest holding in the
sector, Amoco, traded as low as $35 when he started buying it in
August 1995. The shares closed on Friday at $41.6875. Amoco has a
price-to-earnings ratio of 16.6, a price-to-book ratio of 2.5, a
price-to-cash-flow ratio of 8.8 and a yield of 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He also declined to set a price target for Amoco but said that
he expected all of the stocks in his portfolio to increase 50
percent to 100 percent over three years.
</P>
<P>
   The fund holds just 52 stocks. And surprisingly for a
contrarian, Dreman has about 30 percent of the portfolio exposed to
the price of the S&AMP;P 500 through futures contracts.
</P>
<P>
   He holds onto these futures until a stock he is considering
sinks to his target levels. (His current list includes technology
stocks and oil service companies, like the Noble Drilling Corp. and
Tidewater Inc.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather get an S&AMP;P return, and then, at the right time,
buy the stock I want rather than get into that stock early or buy a
second or a third choice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Dreman has a fairly strict ``sell'' discipline _ any stock
that does not perform within three and a half years is out _ the
fund's turnover is a remarkably low 10 percent. He cautions,
however, that buying stocks purely on valuations can lead investors
astray. He spends a lot of time poring over a company's quarterly
reports and balance sheets and talking with management before he
buys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure the companies we buy are going to be
survivors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While many other investors fear the prospect of a market
selloff, Dreman looks forward to one. He searches for breaks to go
against the market grain and take advantage of investor fears.
``We've always been opportunistic,'' he said, ``and that would give
us a chance to take advantage of these corrections.''

MANHATTAN HOTEL RATES AND DEMAND GO SKY HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also sent with `t' and `f' codes) 
(bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Looking for a hotel room in Manhattan? You have
plenty of options.
</P>
<P>
   You could book weeks in advance and pay $300 or so a night for a
room at a modern midtown high-rise like the Crowne Plaza. If you're
willing to pay a bit more _ say, $500 a night on average _ you
could probably get something with less of a hassle at the Four
Seasons or the Pierre. Or you could do what a growing number of
visitors are forced to do: stay in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel market in Manhattan, the most expensive in the nation
and fresh off a record year in 1997, continued to tighten in thia
year's first quarter, compared with the first three months of last
year, with the average cost of a night's stay creeping closer to
$200.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the highest first-quarter average daily rate in
Manhattan's history,'' said Dexter Wood, a hotel consultant with
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand.
</P>
<P>
   The market has become so expensive that in the last 18 months,
five hotels _ the Lowell, the St. Regis and the Carlyle, as well as
the Pierre and the Four Seasons _ began charging an average rate of
$500, with some suites running into four figures. No other city in
the nation has even a single hotel with an average rate so high,
industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   And even as prices rise, it is still difficult to find a room in
New York unless it is booked far in advance. That fact has forced
some visitors to stay in New Jersey or not come to the city at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot find a decent hotel room anywhere on Manhattan, it
seems, for less than a fortune,'' said Alan Bennett of Sydney,
Australia, who was planning to come to the city in August. ``We
have searched database after database and rung hotel chains'
reservations centers, all to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has got to the stage where we are about to scrap our plans
to go to New York and instead split our four or five days there
between an extra day or two in Washington and Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who do find a room are often in for a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred bucks!'' said Susan Jeans of Bayport, Minn., who
booked her room at the Crowne Plaza in mid-Manhattan two weeks in
advance. ``We were expecting like $200.''
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a room in Manhattan rose to $189.70 for the
first quarter of the year, according to preliminary figures from
the Coopers &AMP; Lybrand Lodging Research Network. That is a 13.9
percent leap over the $166.58 average room price for the first
quarter of 1997 and a smaller jump over the $187.91 rate for all of
1997. By the end of the year, Coopers &AMP; Lybrand expects average
room rates to rise an additional 10 to 12 percent, surpassing $200,
a figure reached briefly for the first time last fall and
Christmas, the busiest months of the year for many New York hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy rates are nearing records, too. For the first three
months of the year, which are among the slowest for the industry in
New York, hotels were 80.5 percent filled, according to Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand. That's an increase of 5.4 percent over the first quarter
of 1997, and only slightly down from 82 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1997, which was the highest since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand is unprecedented here,'' said Steven Pipes, general
manager of Le Parker Meridien, a hotel in mid-Manhattan. ``People
wanting a room in the fall, if they don't starting making
reservations now, in the early summertime, they will be missing
out.''
</P>
<P>
   John A. Fox, a senior vice president with PKF Consulting, a
hotel and real estate consulting company in Manhattan, said that
business was good for many reasons: the strong local and national
economies; a continuing shortage of rooms; the city's improved
image, and a cheap dollar in many parts of the world, which makes
it affordable for foreign tourists to come to the city and
expensive for Americans to travel abroad. ``The market has been on
a steady upward climb since 1992,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's decision in 1994 to cut its hotel tax to 15 percent
from 21 percent, along with the state's elimination of its 5
percent hotel tax, may have had some impact as well. ``When taxes
are cut, demand usually rises,'' said Adam Brachet, a spokesman for
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand. ``It's not the whole potato, but it's part of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Zawadzk from Bayport, Minn., was hoping to stay at the
Millennium in mid-Manhattan this month, where a conference he was
attending was being held. He could not get a room, though. Instead,
he, like Ms. Jeans, a colleague, stayed at the Crowne Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do lot more planning next time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn Hanson, chairman of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's hotel and casino
division, said, ``It's a hotelier's dream, rates rising at three to
four times inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased business has led not only to the planned
construction in Manhattan of more than 31 hotels, with more than
11,593 rooms, but also to a slight increase in hotel jobs.
According to the state's Labor Department, hotel employment in New
York City rose by 700 jobs, to 36,200, in April from a year
earlier.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is the fastest growth spurt I've ever experienced in the
hotel industry,'' said Kevin Murphy, regional manager for New
Boston Select Staffing, which provides hotels with personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are filling job requests including housekeeping-cooks-wait
staff, and it's not just body-pushing anymore. Hotel skills are in
great demand. The hotel business is searching for skilled labor,
similar to the information technology industry. With the right
experience, you can write your own ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson also said that hotels were curtailing discounts and
weekend packages because the markets were so strong. ``Everything
is priced premium,'' he said. ``And we are also finding that guests
are spending more money in the hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's hotel space squeeze has sent many corporate travel
managers scrambling. J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. now often books people into
the relatively spartan Club Quarters hotel in downtown Manhattan,
which lacks amenities like in-room faxes and room service.
</P>
<P>
   And with the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau projecting
32.5 million out-of-towners coming to the city this year, including
5.9 million from abroad, many business travelers and tourists may
find that accommodations in New Jersey are their only affordable or
available alternative. But even there, the overflow from Manhattan
is making it difficult to find a room.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Eismeier, the treasurer of Colgate University, could
not get a room two weeks ago. ``We tried a dozen or more hotels,
plus a AAA travel agent, plus the Williams Club,'' she said.
``Friends checked the Cornell Club and the Yale Club _ no soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, the agent suggested the Marriott at Newark Airport. ``It
was just fine. It made me want to see if any of our real estate
investment managers were investing in hotel development in New York
City. Seems like the city needs that.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitors bureau advises people trying to find a room to call
the Peak Season Hotel Hot Line at (800) 846-7666, which makes
reservations for more than 80 hotels in various price ranges and
can give availability information. A person really stuck, the
bureau says, should try contacting hotels after 6 p.m. to check on
canceled reservations the hotels have canceled that have not been
guaranteed with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the new hotels going up, it is probable, according
to Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, that only 4,000 to 5,000 of the approximately
12,000 rooms that are planned will be built; there are now about
54,600 rooms in Manhattan and 6,000 in the rest of the city.

   When it looked for the right recipe for its house brand of
salsa, Shaw's Supermarkets Inc. relied on customer focus groups and
blind taste tests. After much trial and error, Shaw's came up with
a mild sauce that passed muster.
</P>
<P>
   Red-hot salsa may be prized in Texas, but in the land of the
bean and the cod, consumers prefer bland dips for their snack
foods. And the peanut butter had better be just right, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't spread thick on white bread, New Englanders
don't want it,'' says Shaw's spokesman Bernie Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   Picky regional food tastes may partly explain why there isn't a
national supermarket chain. In this land of plenty, tastes can vary
widely, even from neighborhood to neighborhood. As a result, the
food industry has tended to be regionally fragmented, with
supermarket chains succeeding by becoming experts in the food
preferences of local consumers. Get too big, and grocers can lose
sight of what customers want.
</P>
<P>
   All that may be changing. In an industry in which profit margins
are razor thin, market forces are pushing chains to bulk up and get
more efficient. Within a few years, national grocers could emerge,
and that could have major implications for everyone, from consumers
to mom-and-pop stores. Such changes could also rearrange a local
landscape where the three biggest players are Quincy-based Stop &AMP;
Shop Supermarket Co., East Bridgewater-based Shaw's, and
Cambridge-based Star Markets Co.
</P>
<P>
   One force for change may be Wal-Mart Stores Inc. In the last
decade, Wal-Mart has charged its way into the grocery aisle. In
1997, Wal-Mart sold about $20 billion worth of food, about $6
billion behind America's largest grocer, Ohio-based Kroger Co. With
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart becoming a big food presence in the South
and Midwest, many supermarket chains want the buying clout and
efficiencies that acquisitions can bring.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, supermarkets are waging war on a second front.
Consumers now spend about half of every food dollar on takeout and
restaurant meals. A good acquisition can also help supermarkets as
they compete with these rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, the $436 billion US grocery industry has
been consolidating rapidly, with more than 100 mergers or
acquisitions, says the Food Institute, an industry group. The
latest big deal: an agreement by Stop &AMP; Shop's Dutch parent, Royal
Ahold NV, to buy Giant Foods Inc., a 176-store chain based near
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   If this consolidation pace continues, America could soon look a
lot like Europe, where a few big chains rule, says Stop &AMP; Shop
chief executive William J. Grize.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a relatively short time, there will be five or six
retailers dominating our industry,'' Grize predicts. ``You're going
to see things that will make your head spin.''
</P>
<P>
   With population growth stagnant in Europe, big European players
like Ahold see US chains as good investments, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Putting together a national grocery chain may not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   For other retailers, national expansion can be a relatively
straightforward exercise, though not always easy to execute.
</P>
<P>
   A Home Depot can take its formula for a big hardware store and
replicate it from Maine to Oregon. A Staples can open big office
supply stores from coast to coast and thrive. But a cookie-cutter,
one-size-fits-all strategy may not work as well for a business that
lives and dies on knowing the salsa tastes of its local customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sell the same legal pad in Los Angeles that you can in
New York,'' says Staples Inc. founder Thomas G. Stemberg, who once
worked at Star Market. ``But regional food tastes vary widely.
People even have different names for things. In Boston, it's tonic.
In New Jersey, it's soda. In Chicago, it's pop.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to food, consumers are reluctant to buy from
strangers, which may explain why chains think an acquisition is a
better, and often cheaper, way to move into an unfamiliar market
than simply building new stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a warm and fuzzy feeling about their grocer,''
says Steve Griffin, president of the Griffin Report of Food
Marketing, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing makes a food lover more warm and fuzzy than a grocer
who meticulously studies their eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   That's something A&AMP;P may have lost sight of. Thirty years ago,
the Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co. had 4,600 supermarkets and was
about the closest thing America had to a national chain. Now that
total is about 900. A lack of decentralization, an indifference to
customers' tastes, and an unwillingess to use new technologies were
among the reasons cited for A&AMP;P's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ahold and others are using a different strategy. Seeking
to combine the best of both worlds, Ahold lets its chains keep
their identities, names, and management teams while getting more
buying clout and added efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   By creating a network of cooperating chains rather than one big
chain with one name and store format, Ahold hopes to enjoy the
advantages of size without losing sight of local food preferences.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giant acquisition is completed, Ahold will operate US
supermarkets under seven nameplates, including Stop &AMP; Shop, Bi-Lo,
and Tops.
</P>
<P>
   Its East Coast food empire will stretch from Gloucester to the
Florida-Georgia border. And with Stop &AMP; Shop likely to contribute
more than $5.5 billion to the total, Ahold expects its US sales
could account for nearly $20 billion of its roughly $30 billion in
annual worldwide revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Ahold to make more acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we need to be $100 billion in worldwide sales in a few
years,'' says Stop &AMP; Shop's Grize of Ahold's plans.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Ahold's home turf, the food business is different.
Stores stock fewer items and rely less on brand names.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, you won't find nine kinds of yogurt in a
supermarket,'' says Shaw's Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   And in Europe, you won't find the pervasive American-style
television advertising that stimulates brand loyalty for everything
from Cheerios to Coca-Cola, he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   In this vacuum of brand loyalty, European food stores load their
shelves with house brand items. By cutting out brokers and
middlemen, these house brands can mean lower prices for customers _
and higher profit margins for grocers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rogan, house brands account for about half of a
European grocer's sales; in the United States, that number may be
only 20 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, British food operator J Sainsbury plc brought some
of its house-brand grocery strategy to the United States when it
bought Shaw's.Yet in 1998, some observers still wonder if this
house-brand strategy can work on a grand scale in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's top job has been vacant for a few months; operating
profits have dipped. And earlier this year, Shaw's scaled back on
Connecticut expansion plans, says Griffin, the industry newsletter
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's worked as well as they had hoped,'' Griffin
says of the chain's house-brand strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan counters that the numbers show otherwise. In 1997, he
says, house brands at Shaw's accounted for about 40 percent of the
chain's $2.8 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the envy of the industry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As a smaller chain with just over $1 billion in annual sales,
Star Market may face some different challenges.
</P>
<P>
   With so much consolidation in the US grocery industry, the best
way for a small independent chain to survive may be to carve out
its own special niche, says Kurt Funderburg, a supermarket analyst
with Ferris, Baker, Watts in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the strategy of Star Market, a 53-store chain.
Star's hope is that it can become a publicly owned company someday,
says Star chief executive Henry Nasella.
</P>
<P>
   By Nasella's lights, creating a niche means designing each store
to fit an individual neighborhood &UR; , &LR;  with the same care a tailor
uses to fashion a custom-made suit.
</P>
<P>
   Star's newest store, which just opened between Kendall and
Central squares in Cambridge, is a case in point, Nasella says.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Stop &AMP; Shop once had a store nearby, but neighborhood
residents and the company couldn't reach an agreement when Stop &AMP;
Shop wanted to convert and expand the location into its highly
efficient and profitable superstore format.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than continue to operate at a small, antiquated store
that no longer meshed with its superstore formula, Stop &AMP; Shop left
the neighborhood, and Star moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the higher costs of operating in urban areas not
ideally suited to supermarket logistics, Star's new store is
located on two levels of a hotel, something Nasella says has never
been done before.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, Star is competing as much with restaurants as with
other supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter believes a good meal comes from a menu, not a
recipe,'' Nasella says.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter might approve of the new Star, which is full of
meals-to-go and ethnic cuisines carefully matched to the
demographic breakdown of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to ride the popularity of high-profit natural foods, the
store features a Wild Harvest section. Star has also opened four
free-standing stores under the Wild Harvest name.
</P>
<P>
   Like most new supermarkets, the Star in Cambridge aims to
provide one-stop &UR;  &LR; shopping for its customers. Many new stores, in
fact, include a bank branch, a dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a
flower section.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, one-stop &UR;  &LR; shopping has evolved to an even higher
level. In so-called ``hyper-stores,'' customers can buy everything
from duck pate to snow tires.
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart debuted its own
variation, called a Supercenter. In stores as large as 220,000
square feet, grocery aisles have been added to a traditional
Wal-Mart discount store.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Wal-Mart's 469 Supercenters are in the South and
Midwest, says spokesman Keith Morris. In searching for new store
sites, Wal-Mart looks for places where real estate is readily
available and the local population is growing.
</P>
<P>
   That would rule out most of New England for the moment, but
Wal-Mart has just announced plans to open a 40,000-square-foot
``convenience store'' that will sell groceries in its hometown of
Bentonville, Ark. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart rivals such as Kmart and
Target are also experimenting with groceries.
</P>
<P>
   These food forays may not be instantly felt in New England, but
they're fueling supermarket consolidation elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Threatened by the discount stores, small independent chains are
selling out to larger supermarket rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The planned Giant sale to Ahold may prompt more acquisitions.
Shaw's parent, Sainsbury, owned a stake in Giant. Will it still
make sense for Sainsbury to keep Shaw's as its only US chain?
</P>
<P>
   Safeway Inc. faces a similar dilemma. Far from its California
base, it operates stores on Giant's Washington-Baltimore turf.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway may either have to make an East Coast acquisition or
sell the East Coast stores it has now, analyst Funderburg says.
</P>
<P>
   With all this jockeying, is a national supermarket chain
possible? Some observers thinks so. Thanks to scanning devices and
shopper loyalty cards, grocers know more about their customers'
food preferences than ever before. With such technology, it may be
possible for a grocery giant to please salsa lovers in places as
diverse as Texas and Massachusetts.

PROGRESS SEEN IN GM TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Strikes at two General Motors parts factories forced
the automaker to close some of its most profitable assembly plants
Friday, increasing the number of temporarily laid-off workers to
50,900. But tensions started to ease in the dispute, as negotiators
began making slow progress.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the talks said that the tenor had changed
following a pledge by GM officials late Thursday to return
parts-making equipment to a Flint, Mich., plant. The equipment was
removed over Memorial Day weekend from one of two auto parts
factories in Flint, Mich., that have since gone on strike.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders at the United Automobile Workers union, who had been
treating the confrontation in Flint as an emotional showdown over
what they described as strike-breaking tactics by the automaker,
began settling down Friday to discuss with the automaker how many
jobs would be preserved at the two factories. Talks recessed at the
factories late Friday afternoon, but negotiators agreed to return
on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the negotiations continued, GM was closing five more
assembly plants, bringing the total to 13 of GM's 29 assembly
plants in North America. The factories closed Friday included two
in Fort Wayne, Ind., and Pontiac, Mich., that make full-size pickup
trucks and another factory in Janesville, Wis., that produces
full-size sport utility vehicles. Full-size light trucks account
for a tiny share of GM's worldwide sales but close to half of its
profits, according to Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these factories going down, it starts to cost GM real
money,'' said Stephen Girsky, an auto analyst with Morgan Stanley,
who predicted that the strike would be settled by the middle of
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of the equipment-removal issue now makes the
strike very similar to eight others that GM has faced over the last
three years. In most of these factory-level strikes, the union has
tried to insist that GM replace every worker who retires. GM has
tried to eliminate jobs gradually through attrition while
installing more automated equipment or buying more auto parts from
outside companies.
</P>
<P>
   In each strike, negotiators have ended up splitting the
difference, with the UAW slowing but not stopping GM's steady push
to cut costs and become more competitive by producing ever more
cars and components with ever fewer workers.
</P>
<P>
   But in some cases, negotiators have taken a long time to split
the difference. A 17-day strike in 1996 at two brake factories in
Dayton, Ohio, forced GM to close briefly all but two of its 29
North American assembly plants, while temporarily laying off
178,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   GM has tried in each strike to allocate as many parts as
possible to the production of the most profitable light trucks,
while shutting unprofitable car factories first, and has done so
again this week.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 strike, GM agreed to a compromise several days
after it finally ran out of brakes and shut down its Janesville
factory, its sole source then of full-size sport utility vehicles,
which earn profits of $10,000 apiece. But GM has since converted a
factory in Arlington Heights, Texas, to production of the same
models, and that factory remained open Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The current labor dispute is complicated because it involves two
different strikes. The first strike, which began on June 5, shut
down a factory that stamps sheets of steel into hoods, fenders and
other parts for full-size pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.
The second strike, which began on Thursday evening, closed down
GM's main source of spark plugs and various dashboard instruments,
like speedometers.
</P>
<P>
   At the stamping factory, GM contends that some workers have been
trying to collect a full day's pay for half a day of work, while
the UAW wants GM to promise that it will replace 200 workers as
they retire. At the second factory, the UAW is trying to slow a
long decline in employment that has already shrunk the factory's
work force from 13,000 a decade ago to about 5,800 now.
</P>
<P>
   GM has been building new assembly plants and parts factories
overseas to reduce costs, even as it allows its American work force
to shrink gradually. But GM's overall international strategy is not
part of the talks at either factory, which involve specific
provisions of factory-level labor contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at several other GM factories have asked the UAW's
permission to strike but have not received it and are unlikely to
do so soon. The UAW has to pay $150 a week in strike benefits to
workers who walk out. But workers temporarily laid off by GM are
usually eligible for unemployment compensation from state
governments _ which could later demand the money back from GM
through higher unemployment insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   GM tried with little success during the Dayton strike to block
the unemployment benefits on the grounds that the temporarily
laid-off workers were members of the same union that was on strike
elsewhere. The automaker has not decided whether to try to block
benefits this time, said Gerald Holmes, a GM spokesman. &QL;

MCCAIN-JOKE (Phoenix) - Sen. John McCain formally apologized to
President Clinton Friday for a crude joke he made earlier in the
week involving the first lady, her daughter and Attorney General
Janet Reno. ``He feels terrible that he said it,'' McCain press
aide Nancy Ives said. The joke was so bad that Ives declined to
repeat it. ``I don't feel comfortable telling you the joke,'' she
said. ``He feels awful and he regrets that he said it . . . I just
can't repeat it.'' But The Republic has learned it goes something
like this: Do you know why Chelsea is so ugly? Because Janet Reno
is her father. It's the latest in a string of eyebrow-raising
gaffes by the man who many consider a likely White House 2000
candidate. Remember Seizure World? By MICHAEL MURPHY. Story will

MEXHOTELS (HERMOSILLO, Sonora) _ The Mexicans call them hoteles de

by Mexican men and their numerous lovers on the side. And, while
the prevailing thought in Mexico is that machismo is a way of life

LOTTERY (Phoenix) - Ruth Wennerlund, like many regular
Lotteryplayers, uses familiar numbers when she purchases tickets.
Her son was born on Sept. 7, so she always bought Pick 3 tickets
with the same three numbers: 9-0-7. But after a month of playing
the popular new game, she noticed something odd. The number 9 never
was selected during the nightly computer drawings for the game.
``It was really strange,'' said Wennerlund, a Chandler resident.
``So on Tuesday I decided to call the Lottery and ask why 9 had
never been picked.'' Wennerlund said she was told that Lottery
officials had carefully examined the game and that there were no
problems. So she was understandably surprised Friday morning when
she read in ``The Arizona Republic'' that the game had been
suspended because a computer glitch had left nines out of the
drawings. ``I was just so mad,'' said Wennerlund. By HAL MATTERN.

FEWER, BIGGER SUPERMARKET CHAINS MAY BE WHAT FUTURE OFFERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it looked for the right recipe for its house brand of
salsa, Shaw's Supermarkets Inc. relied on customer focus groups and
blind taste tests. After much trial and error, Shaw's came up with
a mild sauce that passed muster.
</P>
<P>
   Red-hot salsa may be prized in Texas, but in the land of the
bean and the cod, consumers prefer bland dips for their snack
foods. And the peanut butter had better be just right, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't spread thick on white bread, New Englanders
don't want it,'' says Shaw's spokesman Bernie Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   Picky regional food tastes may partly explain why there isn't a
national supermarket chain. In this land of plenty, tastes can vary
widely, even from neighborhood to neighborhood. As a result, the
food industry has tended to be regionally fragmented, with
supermarket chains succeeding by becoming experts in the food
preferences of local consumers. Get too big, and grocers can lose
sight of what customers want.
</P>
<P>
   All that may be changing. In an industry in which profit margins
are razor thin, market forces are pushing chains to bulk up and get
more efficient. Within a few years, national grocers could emerge,
and that could have major implications for everyone, from consumers
to mom-and-pop stores. Such changes could also rearrange a local
landscape where the three biggest players are Quincy-based Stop &AMP;
Shop Supermarket Co., East Bridgewater-based Shaw's, and
Cambridge-based Star Markets Co.
</P>
<P>
   One force for change may be Wal-Mart Stores Inc. In the last
decade, Wal-Mart has charged its way into the grocery aisle. In
1997, Wal-Mart sold about $20 billion worth of food, about $6
billion behind America's largest grocer, Ohio-based Kroger Co. With
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart becoming a big food presence in the South
and Midwest, many supermarket chains want the buying clout and
efficiencies that acquisitions can bring.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, supermarkets are waging war on a second front.
Consumers now spend about half of every food dollar on takeout and
restaurant meals. A good acquisition can also help supermarkets as
they compete with these rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, the $436 billion US grocery industry has
been consolidating rapidly, with more than 100 mergers or
acquisitions, says the Food Institute, an industry group. The
latest big deal: an agreement by Stop &AMP; Shop's Dutch parent, Royal
Ahold NV, to buy Giant Foods Inc., a 176-store chain based near
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   If this consolidation pace continues, America could soon look a
lot like Europe, where a few big chains rule, says Stop &AMP; Shop
chief executive William J. Grize.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a relatively short time, there will be five or six
retailers dominating our industry,'' Grize predicts. ``You're going
to see things that will make your head spin.''
</P>
<P>
   With population growth stagnant in Europe, big European players
like Ahold see US chains as good investments, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Putting together a national grocery chain may not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   For other retailers, national expansion can be a relatively
straightforward exercise, though not always easy to execute.
</P>
<P>
   A Home Depot can take its formula for a big hardware store and
replicate it from Maine to Oregon. A Staples can open big office
supply stores from coast to coast and thrive. But a cookie-cutter,
one-size-fits-all strategy may not work as well for a business that
lives and dies on knowing the salsa tastes of its local customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sell the same legal pad in Los Angeles that you can in
New York,'' says Staples Inc. founder Thomas G. Stemberg, who once
worked at Star Market. ``But regional food tastes vary widely.
People even have different names for things. In Boston, it's tonic.
In New Jersey, it's soda. In Chicago, it's pop.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to food, consumers are reluctant to buy from
strangers, which may explain why chains think an acquisition is a
better, and often cheaper, way to move into an unfamiliar market
than simply building new stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a warm and fuzzy feeling about their grocer,''
says Steve Griffin, president of the Griffin Report of Food
Marketing, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing makes a food lover more warm and fuzzy than a grocer
who meticulously studies their eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   That's something A&AMP;P may have lost sight of. Thirty years ago,
the Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co. had 4,600 supermarkets and was
about the closest thing America had to a national chain. Now that
total is about 900. A lack of decentralization, an indifference to
customers' tastes, and an unwillingess to use new technologies were
among the reasons cited for A&AMP;P's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ahold and others are using a different strategy. Seeking
to combine the best of both worlds, Ahold lets its chains keep
their identities, names, and management teams while getting more
buying clout and added efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   By creating a network of cooperating chains rather than one big
chain with one name and store format, Ahold hopes to enjoy the
advantages of size without losing sight of local food preferences.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giant acquisition is completed, Ahold will operate US
supermarkets under seven nameplates, including Stop &AMP; Shop, Bi-Lo,
and Tops.
</P>
<P>
   Its East Coast food empire will stretch from Gloucester to the
Florida-Georgia border. And with Stop &AMP; Shop likely to contribute
more than $5.5 billion to the total, Ahold expects its US sales
could account for nearly $20 billion of its roughly $30 billion in
annual worldwide revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Ahold to make more acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we need to be $100 billion in worldwide sales in a few
years,'' says Stop &AMP; Shop's Grize of Ahold's plans.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Ahold's home turf, the food business is different.
Stores stock fewer items and rely less on brand names.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, you won't find nine kinds of yogurt in a
supermarket,'' says Shaw's Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   And in Europe, you won't find the pervasive American-style
television advertising that stimulates brand loyalty for everything
from Cheerios to Coca-Cola, he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   In this vacuum of brand loyalty, European food stores load their
shelves with house brand items. By cutting out brokers and
middlemen, these house brands can mean lower prices for customers _
and higher profit margins for grocers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rogan, house brands account for about half of a
European grocer's sales; in the United States, that number may be
only 20 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, British food operator J Sainsbury plc brought some
of its house-brand grocery strategy to the United States when it
bought Shaw's.Yet in 1998, some observers still wonder if this
house-brand strategy can work on a grand scale in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's top job has been vacant for a few months; operating
profits have dipped. And earlier this year, Shaw's scaled back on
Connecticut expansion plans, says Griffin, the industry newsletter
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's worked as well as they had hoped,'' Griffin
says of the chain's house-brand strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan counters that the numbers show otherwise. In 1997, he
says, house brands at Shaw's accounted for about 40 percent of the
chain's $2.8 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the envy of the industry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As a smaller chain with just over $1 billion in annual sales,
Star Market may face some different challenges.
</P>
<P>
   With so much consolidation in the US grocery industry, the best
way for a small independent chain to survive may be to carve out
its own special niche, says Kurt Funderburg, a supermarket analyst
with Ferris, Baker, Watts in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the strategy of Star Market, a 53-store chain.
Star's hope is that it can become a publicly owned company someday,
says Star chief executive Henry Nasella.
</P>
<P>
   By Nasella's lights, creating a niche means designing each store
to fit an individual neighborhood &UR; , &LR;  with the same care a tailor
uses to fashion a custom-made suit.
</P>
<P>
   Star's newest store, which just opened between Kendall and
Central squares in Cambridge, is a case in point, Nasella says.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Stop &AMP; Shop once had a store nearby, but neighborhood
residents and the company couldn't reach an agreement when Stop &AMP;
Shop wanted to convert and expand the location into its highly
efficient and profitable superstore format.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than continue to operate at a small, antiquated store
that no longer meshed with its superstore formula, Stop &AMP; Shop left
the neighborhood, and Star moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the higher costs of operating in urban areas not
ideally suited to supermarket logistics, Star's new store is
located on two levels of a hotel, something Nasella says has never
been done before.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, Star is competing as much with restaurants as with
other supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter believes a good meal comes from a menu, not a
recipe,'' Nasella says.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter might approve of the new Star, which is full of
meals-to-go and ethnic cuisines carefully matched to the
demographic breakdown of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to ride the popularity of high-profit natural foods, the
store features a Wild Harvest section. Star has also opened four
free-standing stores under the Wild Harvest name.
</P>
<P>
   Like most new supermarkets, the Star in Cambridge aims to
provide one-stop &UR;  &LR; shopping for its customers. Many new stores, in
fact, include a bank branch, a dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a
flower section.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, one-stop &UR;  &LR; shopping has evolved to an even higher
level. In so-called ``hyper-stores,'' customers can buy everything
from duck pate to snow tires.
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart debuted its own
variation, called a Supercenter. In stores as large as 220,000
square feet, grocery aisles have been added to a traditional
Wal-Mart discount store.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Wal-Mart's 469 Supercenters are in the South and
Midwest, says spokesman Keith Morris. In searching for new store
sites, Wal-Mart looks for places where real estate is readily
available and the local population is growing.
</P>
<P>
   That would rule out most of New England for the moment, but
Wal-Mart has just announced plans to open a 40,000-square-foot
``convenience store'' that will sell groceries in its hometown of
Bentonville, Ark. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart rivals such as Kmart and
Target are also experimenting with groceries.
</P>
<P>
   These food forays may not be instantly felt in New England, but
they're fueling supermarket consolidation elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Threatened by the discount stores, small independent chains are
selling out to larger supermarket rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The planned Giant sale to Ahold may prompt more acquisitions.
Shaw's parent, Sainsbury, owned a stake in Giant. Will it still
make sense for Sainsbury to keep Shaw's as its only US chain?
</P>
<P>
   Safeway Inc. faces a similar dilemma. Far from its California
base, it operates stores on Giant's Washington-Baltimore turf.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway may either have to make an East Coast acquisition or
sell the East Coast stores it has now, analyst Funderburg says.
</P>
<P>
   With all this jockeying, is a national supermarket chain
possible? Some observers thinks so. Thanks to scanning devices and
shopper loyalty cards, grocers know more about their customers'
food preferences than ever before. With such technology, it may be
possible for a grocery giant to please salsa lovers in places as
diverse as Texas and Massachusetts.

TEXAN TAKES ON POLICE OVER HIS GRANDMOTHER'S REMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACQUE CROUSE   c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ She took care of him, helped him sort out his
problems and loved hi m like no one else ever has.
</P>
<P>
   So when June Hewitt died at age 63 and was cremated in 1995, her
grandson, Michael Horne, took some of her ashes, put them in a
plastic, zip-up bag and carried them with him at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Horne, 21, kept her ashes and memory close, never dreaming that
the police in San Antonio would some day arrest him on drug charges
because of the bag of remains he carried with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carried them because I missed her, and she's the one person
in my life I ever cared about,'' he said Thursday in his lawyer's
office. ``When she passed away, I was alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Horne and his lawyer, Luis Vera, have filed a lawsuit against
the city and plan to amend it to add the county and the
manufacturer of a field-test kit that police officers use to detect
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint in the Army, Horne moved to San Antonio and worked
for about six mo nths as a security guard. After working a 12-hour
shift on July 30, 1997, he head ed home at 2:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Too tired to drive, he pulled his Chevy Blazer into a parking
lot for a nap.
</P>
<P>
   Then he saw a police car stop and an officer with a spotlight
approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it here in San Antonio until then,'' he said. ``But
what happened next made my whole point of view on Texas go
downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers searched his vehicle and found his large, tri-fold
wallet. In it was the baggie, folded neatly around Hewitt's driving
license. The officer used a field-test kit and found the contents
of the bag tested positive for methamphetamine. Horne was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was telling everyone it was his grandmother's remains, and
when he told the magistrate, the magistrate's reaction was to ask
the police if they wanted him to set the bond even higher,'' Vera
said.
</P>
<P>
   Horne couldn't post the $7,500 bond. He spent the next 30 days
in the Bexar County Jail, the first half wearing a mask and in
isolation because another test false ly showed he had tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   All the while Horne kept asking to see a lawyer, to talk to the
judge, to get som eone to listen to the truth. He got no help, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even find out when my court date would be,'' he
said. ``I found out when the jail guards woke me up two hours
before and said to get up, I was going to court.''
</P>
<P>
   Two laboratory tests showed the bag contained human remains.
Prosecutors eventually dropped all charges against the man and a
judge ordered him released on Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Horne walked out of jail and straight to Vera's office, where he
had been
</P>
<P>
   referred by another inmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had lost my truck _ they repo'd it while I was in jail,'' he
said. ``The secu rity service firm didn't want me back because of
the drug charge. And I was kicked out of my apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Vera had to get a court order to get the grandmother's remains
back _ it took unt il January. He has been unable to get Hewitt's
driving license and Horne's wallet returned.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what remains of his grandmother's confiscated ashes are
in his lawyer's office. But Horne has a tiny amount he still
carries with him in a plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   His grandmother would have been upset at his being jailed in the
first place, but Horne believes she would be happy about the course
he has taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because she knows in the end I'll be OK,'' Horne said.
``In a way, I feel like she's still taking care of me, watching
over me.''

ASIAN CRISIS CONTINUES TO RATTLE STOCKS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market continued to cascade Friday, falling
sharply for the fourth consecutive session on renewed concerns
about Asia's economic woes, before a rally late in the day pushed
prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   Heightened fears about another round of economic and financial
turmoil in Asia has roiled stock markets around the world this
week, but Friday investors finished off a bad spell by buying back
into the market in the last hour of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which had fallen as much as
128 points early in the day, ended up 23.17 points higher, closing
at 8,834.94. For the week, though, the Dow lost 202.77 points, or
2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, a broader measure, rose
4.26, to 1,098.84. But the Nasdaq composite index, which is packed
with technology issues, fell for the third session, down 4.70, to
1,745.05.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices, meanwhile, dipped a day after a sharp rise pushed
long-term interest rates to their lowest level in about 30 years.
Friday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury, which moves in
the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.66 percent from
5.65 percent a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Although the economy appears remarkably sound, with hefty growth
and low inflation, Wall Street analysts said the recent global
selloff was once again raising the specter of troubles ahead. Even
while Friday's market eked out a gain, the trend has been
unnervingly bearish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market's going through this classic Asia crisis meltdown
drill,'' said Stephen Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter. ``There's a fear that Japan and Asia are out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-April, stock prices have been choppy and largely
depressed, unable to gain much ground after a sharp run-up early in
the year. Slowing growth in profits and a widespread belief that
share prices have grown too expensive are said to be contributing
to the weakness. But as Roach said, now, much like last October,
there are reverberations from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that economies throughout Asia and the Pacific
region are floundering, creating fears that the economic crisis
could eventually disrupt the U.S. economy, which Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress on Wednesday was as
``impressive'' as any economy he had seen in his nearly 50 years of
close observation.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Asia is particularly acute in Japan, which has
been sputtering for much of the decade. Friday, more bad news came
when the government said the Japanese economy contracted at a 5.3
percent annualized rate in the first quarter, confirming reports
that the economy has fallen into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   That downturn has drastically weakened the Japanese yen against
the dollar, and economists fear a sliding yen might cause other
Asian currencies to plunge, creating a ripple effect that could
reduce demand for American products in Asia and cut into corporate
earnings, which are already weakening.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Energy and technology stocks have been particularly hard hit in
recent months. Oil stocks have fallen sharply with oil prices, and
technology issues have slid because of falling earnings estimates
partly because of Asia's impact on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in early trading Friday, the Nasdaq fell a full 10
percent below its all-time high of 1,917.61, a drop that
constituted a benchmark ``correction'' in Wall Street parlance. But
analysts said heavy computerized buying programs in the last hour
of trading lifted blue-chip issues and even some technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks, which have
long trailed the bigger issues, also fell Friday, dropping 10
percent below its all-time high and leaving the index virtually
flat on the year.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Dudack, the chief investment officer at UBS Securities,
said that the continuing crisis in Asia simply exacerbates fears
about slowing profit growth in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wages are growing so much faster than pricing,'' she said.
``The big risk is that profits are plateauing. What Asia means is
that top-line growth will be hurt; we won't be able to sell them
anything, and they'll compete with our products on price.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roach said fears that the yen's weakness would force China
to devalue _ setting off a broader competitive round of
devaluations _ was overblown. China and Japan do not compete
directly in the export market, he said, and the Chinese economy
remains strong and will probably be able to withstand the yen's
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are reacting as if Japan is unexpectedly
imploding,'' he said. ``Japan has long abdicated its role as a
leader of Asia and an engine of global growth. And even if the
Asian crisis continues, I think the global economy will be OK.'' &QL;

SHADOWY BANK IN BASEL DESERVES CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CREDIT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the institutions of international finance, none is more
shadowy than the Bank for International Settlements, which conducts
its business from a bland glass office tower in Basel, overlooking
the spot along the Rhine where Switzerland gives way to the border
of France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund gets beat up regularly for its
role in the Asian financial crisis. The Federal Reserve Board gets
credit for keeping the American economy strong.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a certain amount of credit and blame for each must be
assigned to the BIS, which ordinarily escapes notice altogether.
The central bankers' central bank held its 68th annual meeting last
week, and issued an annual report that offers the best available
synopsis of the view from the quarterdeck of the world financial
system. (It can be found on the Web at http://www.bis.org)
</P>
<P>
   Its verdict on the conduct of institutional investors last year:
that pension fund managers sensed the developing problems in Asia
and lightened up appropriately starting in 1996, while the big
commercial banks continued to plunge in with loans. Whether the
banks' heedlessness arose from a wish to please their high-rolling
customers, or was influenced by the expectation that a bailout
would be forthcoming, would require further investigation, said the
BIS.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing seemed clear: The hedge funds, with their
aggressive investment strategies and exceedingly private ways, were
not the villains of the piece. No very extensive short positions
against Asian currencies _ bets that the currencies would fall _ in
the summer of 1997 and thereafter could be demonstrated
statistically among the hedge funds as a group, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The BIS wasn't created to be the global cockpit and lender of
last resort that it has become. Chartered in 1930 under the terms
of the agreements that ended World War I, it was supposed to go out
of business in 1990, after sixty years of overseeing German
reparation payments to the nations of Triple Entente.
</P>
<P>
   As with so much else, fate took a hand. For the BIS, that meant
a gradual evolution under the terms of the post-World War II
Bretton Woods agreements into the manager of the global currency
system. Today it holds around 7 percent of the world's currency
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Though it seldom makes a loan, its readiness to lend freely to
governments in crisis makes it the last line of defense against
panic. An often crackerjack analytic capability equips it to serve
as an early-warning system against financial excess.
</P>
<P>
   (The BIS has been criticized for being slow to sound the alarm
in Asia, but last year's report did warn firmly about heavy
investment in Asian projects with ``questionable profitability
prospects.'')
</P>
<P>
   It also oversees the ultimate soundness of the international
banking system, negotiating in 1988, for example, the accord that
eventually guided banks around the world to new standards for
capital adequecy.
</P>
<P>
   In a world in which new instruments and financial institutions
appear and grow at lightning speed, the BIS fulfills a crucial
mission. It serves as the absolute top of the heap, the pinnacle to
which responsibility-takers of a certain sort can aspire. Central
bank governors gather once a month in its serene dining rooms to
rub elbows and talk shop. Committees of blue-chip staffers labor
nightly in its conference rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers are creating financial institutions of breathtaking
reach. Bankers are richer and more powerful than ever. Even so, BIS
regulators still cultivate the immunity to temptation that is the
essence of successful banking supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Its personnel fly first class, retire to generous pensions
(instead of working the revolving door with the private sector),
and in general convey the aura of worldly perpendicularity that is
necessary in order to persuade the best bankers to confide
one-anothers' secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the perpendicularity of the central bankers in the
glass tower is too great. The recent decision to convene a working
group of high-ranking central bankers and treasury officials from
22 nations to deal with the Asian crisis has been construed as a
rebuke to the central bankers' efforts to take the lead in
prescribing to the politicians. And the steady expansion of the
bank's membership has not ameliorated the impression that the BIS
hasn't yet become truly multinational.
</P>
<P>
   But the quiet old city on the Rhine is likely to continue to be
the rendezvous of choice for the world's most powerful civil
servants, as governments pursue their efforts to keep control of
the world`s increasingly complex financial system. The
international association of insurance regulators recently
relocated to Basel; efforts are underway to persuade the securities
commissioners to join them (they are currently headquartered in
Montreal.)
</P>
<P>
   But all the sunshine in the world, in the form of more timely
disclosure, won't eliminate the problem of the business cycle. As
the BIS pointed out in this year's annual report, transparency is
not enough. ``What is also needed is the vision to imagine crises,
and the will to act pre-emptively.''
</P>
<P>
   So even after the European Bank replaces the various national
central banks over the next few years and so reconfigures its
geometry decisively, the Bank for International Settlements is
likely to be preferred location for quietly hashing out the thorny
problems of central banking.

ILLEGAL WORKERS SUFFER UNDER NEW REGIME IN MOSCOW

 By CELESTINE BOHLEN     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After working five weeks as an illegal laborer on a
Moscow construction site, Ivan, a Ukrainian crane operator, was
heading home to Kiev last October with his hard-earned wages
carefully hidden where the Moscow police could not find them.
</P>
<P>
   But he had left $85 worth of Russian rubles, set aside for the
journey, in his pocket _ easy pickings for the policemen who
stopped him at the railroad station and hauled him off for some
rough questioning, saying he would be charged as drunk and
disorderly.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan _ who would not give his last name _ insists that he was
neither drunk nor disorderly. But knowing the power of the
authorities against illegal workers like himself, he agreed to sign
a paper saying he had had one beer. With that, he was thrown back
out on the street, with the $85 left behind as a ``gift'' to
Moscow's notoriously corrupt police.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing we can do, we have no rights whatsoever,''
said Ivan, 55, who is now back in Moscow on another illegal job,
living a tenuous existence in a dilapidated wooden camper with a
half-dozen other illegal workers from Ukraine, all here in
desperate search of work.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, there are as many as a million foreign
workers in and around Moscow _ many from Ukraine, Moldova and other
parts of the former Soviet Union _ who come here offering their
labor at virtually any price. Some are paid as little as $100 a
month, some three times as much. Some get paid virtually nothing _
once the cost of housing and food have been deducted.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the old days of the Soviet Union, Moscow is a magnet
for the rest of country, and beyond. In those days, people came to
shop for goods that were hard to find anywhere else. Now they come
to work and to soak up some of the riches that have poured into the
Russian capital, home to about 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after the collapse of Soviet Communism, the official
unemployment rate in this city is a remarkable 0.7 percent. The
unofficial rate is probably higher, labor experts say, but then so
is the number of black-market jobs, many in sidewalk kiosks or
wholesale markets, but also in the private-sector service economy.
But the greatest number of illegal migrants work in Moscow's
bustling building trades, constructing the myriad new office and
apartment complexes that dot the city's skyline, catering to the
new middle class' craze for ``evroremonts,'' the word coined to
describe apartments remodeled to West European standards.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the bleakness of outlying regions, where salaries
can be less than $100 a month, Moscow has the air of a fairy-tale
metropolis, an Emerald City rising in the midst of a depressed
post-industrial landscape. Its exuberant, often vulgar prosperity
is symbolized by its high-rises decked with fanciful towers and
domes, its sparkling shop windows and many furniture and appliance
stores catering to the brisk evroremont market.
</P>
<P>
   That contrast is most vivid at the city's train stations, where
local employers come to meet particular trains _ particularly from
Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova _ scanning the platforms for young men
with tell-tale rough hands and carrying cloth bags filled with work
clothes and even provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the foreign workers in Moscow come from the former
Soviet Union. According to the city's Migration Service, which has
legally registered fewer than 50,000 workers, the largest group in
this category is Turks, employed by large Turkish construction
companies in large projects including refurbishing the home of the
Russian Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But as Alexander Vavrov, chief of the service's international
relations bureau, concedes, the vast majority of foreign workers in
Moscow are illegal, and thus uncounted. With only 10 inspectors, he
said, the city is only just beginning to track down violators. The
first companies sanctioned for hiring unregistered workers,
however, were not the big construction companies, many of them
closely linked to city hall, but McDonald's and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The migrants, for the most part, are taking jobs at wages
Muscovites would refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like in Switzerland,'' said a young Belarussian who
sleeps at night in the apartments where he works days sanding and
painting. ``It's work local people don't want to do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But what may be slave wages in boom town Moscow can be a
princely sum back where the illegal workers come from. Ivan, for
instance, brings home money to help support his daughter, who is a
teacher, and his son, a doctor, whose salaries in Ukraine average
$60 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen a whole village come from Moldova, with women and
children,'' said a young man who has worked as a recruiter for a
Moscow construction company and spoke on condition that he not be
identified. ``It is the opportunity that brings them here, because
they have none at home. They come knowing there is a risk in how
they will be treated, but they come anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They end up in a situation of virtual slaves,'' said
Konstantin Krylov, secretary of the Federation of Independent Trade
Unions. ``There is no one who can defend them. The employer can pay
what he wants, make them work as much they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all migrants make it all the way into Moscow, where the
police routinely check people's documents, searching the streets
for ``foreigners'' _ who can include Russians without Moscow
residence permits.
</P>
<P>
   Russian courts have found Moscow's permit system, a holdover
from Soviet times, to be unconstitutional. But that has not stopped
the city's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, from enforcing it anyway, deploying
police on missions that often amount to nothing more than
officially sanctioned shake-downs, with ``fines'' averaging about
$8.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do not want to risk an encounter with police,
there is also work to be had on the city's outskirts, among
Muscovites' dachas, or country houses. Arriving in bands of three
or four, the workers knock on doors, offering to repair porches or
roofs or plant trees in return for room and board and, if they are
lucky, maybe $200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work in the summer, and then go home in the winter, like
bears going into hibernation,'' said Nikolai, who together with
three friends had found a job in a village of dachas southeast of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, he said, is to stay at home in Mordvinia, a
region in central Russia, and live off his wife's earnings from the
local light-bulb factory, which in recent months have amounted to
bags of flour and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, these construction workers are like illegal
immigrants the world over, whether Chinese women working in sweat
shops in New York City or Mexican farm workers in California. But
the difference is that, for 70 years of Soviet rule, Russia was a
country that elevated workers' rights to the level of a state
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for many workers in the private sector, legal and illegal,
it is a country where all power has shifted back to the employers,
many of whom are more ruthless than those in pre-Bolshevik Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are getting paid under the table, you are getting
ripped off,'' said Irene Stevenson, field representative in Russia
for the American Center for International Labor Solidarity. ``The
employers are avoiding an entire range of taxes, which in turn
leaves an entire range of people unprotected. In the case of
migrant workers, it is a complete violation of rights, because they
have nowhere to appeal.'' &QL;

WOMEN CONTROLLERS SUE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMELYN CRUZ LAT   c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO Five female air traffic controllers have filed a
class-action law suit against the U.S. Department of
Transportation, alleging job discrimination a nd sexual harassment
so severe that it distracted them from
</P>
<P>
   their duties and thre atened the safety of airline passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco federal court earlier this
month and served on the government Thursday, claims that the women
were subjected to years of lewd jokes, demeaning comments, physical
and verbal intimidation and retaliation for complaints. The women
also allege discrimination in job assignments, pay and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harassment ranged from men yelling at women in their face
and upsetting them to exposing their private parts to offensive
jokes,'' said Brad Yamauchi, the l awyer for the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shenanigans and insults were done to distract women from
their jobs, to force them to fail. ... Imagine the incredible
strain on these women
</P>
<P>
   responsible for the safety of passengers and crews, the pressure
put on them to slip up. The reality is there is a very small margin
of error. If you lose concentration, if you' re distracted, that's
going to impact safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names as defendants Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater and the Transportation Department, which is the parent
agency of the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Williams, chief counsel with the Department of
Transportation in Washington, did not return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks ``a complete overhaul of the male-dominated
`good ol' boy' culture that dictates every aspect of the air
traffic control work environment.'' According to the lawsuit, one
woman from Sacramento, Calif., alleged that a male supervisor
unzipped her sweater and exposed her bra to a male co-worker. The
supe rvisor was fired but later reinstated while the female
employee was transferred and demoted.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman claimed in the suit that a male supervisor in
Santa Barbara, Calif. , had a habit of creeping up on women air
traffic controllers, exposing to them and exclaiming, ``Look what
you've done!''
</P>
<P>
   Some women claimed they were denied necessary training given to
their male counterparts, assigned menial tasks and were subjected
to verbal and physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the more than 1,400 female
air traffic controllers, about 10 percent of the 14,000 controllers
in hundreds of towers across the country.

FOR AMERICANS AN INDIRECT ROUTE TO THE PARTY  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 14)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ A case can be made that one way for Americans to invest
in Europe is to buy stock in American companies that do big chunks
of business here.
</P>
<P>
   The argument goes like this: As European nations go about
marrying their national currencies, the wedding will be catered in
large measure from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how, consider the following:
</P>
<P>
   European economies and stock markets are booming. Monetary union
and the year-2000 computer problem are forcing European companies
to bolster technology investments, which have lagged woefully
behind those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So, with markets still reeling in Asia and with earnings growth
slowing in the United States, American multinationals may well be
relying more than ever on Europe to maintain profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusion is that United States companies are uniquely
positioned to benefit from these trends,'' said Joe Rooney, chief
equity strategist at Lehman Brothers Securities in London.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because Europe remains the bedrock of American
business overseas, even if Asia has grabbed most of the headlines
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Carlson, an economist at Merrill Lynch in New York,
said direct investment abroad by American companies has been so
vigorous in recent years that the value of the goods and services
they produce and sell outside the United States is now three times
the total value of all American exports. And fully 60 percent of
that external activity is in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some global mutual funds are picking the American stocks
in their portfolios partly on the basis of their exposure to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Fortis Global Growth, with $173 million in assets, owns American
multinationals simply because they rank among the ``best-managed
growth-oriented companies anywhere in the world,'' said Jim Byrd,
the Fortis executive vice president who manages the fund. Yet, he
added, in his stock-picking, ``Asia is a disaster, and Latin
America is tied to Asia, so Europe wins by default.''
</P>
<P>
   Several American companies in his portfolio have recently
expanded in Europe: Tellabs Inc., a manufacturer of phone equipment
that plans to acquire the Ciena Corp.; Cisco Systems, a Tellabs
competitor; the Enron Corp., the energy company, and Service Corp.
International, the funeral-home chain.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say that there is no reason to be indirect about
investing in Europe. Buying American stocks to enjoy Europe's boom,
they note, can deny a portfolio the benefits that come with
diversifying into a variety of markets.
</P>
<P>
   And buying into Europe through the shares of American
multinationals can be expensive; companies like General Electric,
Coca-Cola or Gillette, all with strong European businesses, also
trade at high price-to-earnings multiples, said Doug Wilde, an
equity strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see real opportunities in Europe by specifically tapping
into European shares,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some American companies will reap direct benefits from
forces at work in Europe. For example, said Mark Howdle, European
equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in London, Europe's
retailers and makers of brand-name products are likely to suffer as
the euro lets Europeans scour the continent for the cheapest goods.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, he said, benefits will accrue to American pioneers in
electronic commerce, like Amazon.com, which recently acquired
Internet booksellers in Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, said Jeffrey Weingarten, global strategist at Goldman
Sachs in London, Europe's big investment in technology will pay off
for American companies like IBM, Intel and Microsoft.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Will investors buy on stock market dips?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question market watchers ask nervously whenever
equities start to look a little wan. And the averages have looked
wan for something over a month now. The Dow Jones industrial
average closed Friday at 8,834.94, down 2.2 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, dip-buying, the strategy that has served
investors so well since the October 1987 crash, continues apace.
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence that small investors are jumping into falling
markets comes courtesy of AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual
fund inflows. For the week ending Wednesday, more than half the
$4.9 billion that investors put into equity mutual funds went into
large-capitalization stock funds and index funds, according to AMG.
</P>
<P>
   But a surprising 26 percent of the money _ $1.3 billion _ was
earmarked for small-cap, aggressive growth and technology funds,
areas that have been decidedly weak.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had been sellers of small-cap and technology funds
during the last two weeks of May. But with the NASDAQ composite _ a
proxy for aggressive-growth and small-cap shares _ down around 9
percent from its April high, they came back with a vengeance.
Technology issues, measured by the Standard &AMP; Poor's High
Technology Composite, were down 10 percent when the buyers roared
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speculator is alive and well, despite market conditions,''
said Robert Adler, president of AMG. ``If this market stalls, it's
not because of an abatement in positive investor sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, investors seem to be increasingly impervious to what can
only be called serious internal bleeding in individual stocks.
While market averages like the S&AMP;P 500-stock and the NASDAQ
composite indexes are both up 24 percent in the last 12 months, the
performance of those weighted indexes is exaggerated by the gains
of big stocks. Declines in many individual stocks are getting
scary.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the findings of a study by John Manley Jr., an equity
strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. As of June 2, the average
NASDAQ stock had fallen 30 percent from its 52-week high. Some 60
percent of all NASDAQ stocks are down 20 percent or more. And 84
percent are off more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in larger stocks have been luckier; the average
decline for an S&AMP;P 500 stock is 15 percent. But more than 10
percent of the stocks in the index are down 30 percent or more;
more than half have fallen at least 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through, internally, one of the most grueling
market periods,'' Manley said. ``Only once in the last eight years
has the damage been notably greater for the NASDAQ. Even among the
bigger stocks, the average decline has been fairly substantial by
recent standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet investors seem to take these body blows with aplomb. Does
this mean they have a new, increased tolerance for market pain?
That the market could fall 30 percent and investors would simply
shrug? In the not-so-distant past, a 15 percent drop in a stock was
something to be concerned about.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that one of the wealth effects of this great bull
market is that the poverty effect of a bear move no longer
registers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a gambler who's won so much, now he's playing
with the house's money,'' said Ted Aronson, a money manager in
Philadelphia. ``Wouldn't you be more willing to take a risk and
play again if you'd just won 10 games of blackjack in a row?'' &QL;

NEW MEXICO BANS DRIVE-IN LIQUOR SALES, BUT THE FIGHT ISN'T OVER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For Release Sunday, June 14) 
(Eds.: a tilde goes over n in Munoz) 
 
By KIM COBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying liquor in New Mexico for decades has been as easy as
rolling through McDonald's, but the state's 234 drive-in liquor
windows will be illegal by early August.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the ban, recently enacted by the state's
Legislature, believe that closing the windows will reduce New
Mexico's historically high rate of alcohol-related traffic deaths,
partly by slowing sales to minors and drivers who already are
intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the new law will only put people out of business,
although owners of the drive-ins, commonly called ``drive-ups'' in
New Mexico, will be allowed to convert their businesses to walk-in
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard from at least six different business owners who say
there's no way (they can stay in business),'' said Lisa Ulibari,
president of the state association of bar and liquor store owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is because a lot of these drive-up windows are in
small communities who have an Albertsons or a Walgreens (which are
allowed to sell liquor in New Mexico) with easy access. So what
happens is the drive-up window is really their only advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the smaller operators live day-to-day and don't have the
money for remodeling, Ulibari said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the affected businesses are mulling a lawsuit
challenging the constitutionality of closing the drive-ins without
compensation, Ulibari said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Nathan, special counsel to the state attorney general, said
he expects a lawsuit to be filed a day or two before the law goes
into effect Aug. 2, on the theory that there's money to be made
while a legal challenge delays the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls have shown that a majority of New Mexico
voters have supported closing the drive-ins for some time, Nathan
said, but the liquor industry opponents are vocal and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hot issue in New Mexico,'' Nathan said. ``Those of us
in favor of reform are labeled prohibitionists.''
</P>
<P>
   For years New Mexico was No. 1 in the nation for alcohol-related
traffic fatalities per capita. The state's Traffic Safety Bureau
notes that the state's rates ``steadily declined'' for 15 years,
but the trend was reversed in 1996 when New Mexico returned to the
top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Johnson has changed his position on the drive-ins
since being elected in 1995. He took office saying drinking and
driving was a matter of personal responsibility and didn't believe
closing the windows would affect DWI rates.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson later said he would sign a local option election bill
that would have allowed voters to decide the issue in individual
communities. But by this year, he indicated he would consider
signing a statewide ban.
</P>
<P>
   The New Mexico Legislature sent Johnson three bills at the end
of its special session in May: a local option bill, a statewide ban
on window sales, and a third approach also banning the windows but
granting liquor store owners the sole right to liquor sales after 9
p.m., supposedly to help recoup the anticipated business losses to
groceries and drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   Often the debate over banning drive-in windows turned a
spotlight on McKinley County, where window sales have been banned
by special legislation since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this name, `Drunk City,' for 30 years,'' said Ed Munoz,
the former mayor of Gallup, the McKinley county seat.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz said his years as a tow truck operator had shown him some
pretty gruesome alcohol-related traffic accidents, but the deaths
of a young mother, her 3-month-old baby and another family member
at the hands of a drunken driver in 1989 galvanized the community
to organize against the alcohol problem.
</P>
<P>
   A protest march while the Legislature was in session drew 4,000
people who walked nearly 200 miles to Santa Fe in the dead of
winter, Munoz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature agreed to pass a law allowing McKinley County to
outlaw the drive-in windows as a local option. The community also
built a large detoxification center, and levied an excise tax on
the sale of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Donna Goodrich with the McKinley County Sheriff's office
said the county's DWI rate has not changed significantly since the
windows were closed, but alcohol-related fatalities have dropped.
``Whether they are connected, I don't know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the year before the march on Santa Fe, 17 percent of
McKinley County's auto accidents were alcohol-related, compared to
a 9.5 percent statewide rate. In 1996, McKinley County's rate was
still 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1988, 33 people died in alcohol-related accidents in
McKinley County, and by 1996 that number had dropped slightly to 31
deaths (despite an increase in licensed drivers). In 1997,
preliminary state figures show only 17 people died in
alcohol-related traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Atkinson, director of the state's DWI Resource Center, is
encouraged by McKinley County's apparent progress, though she
concedes the results cannot be attributed to closing the drive-ins
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Special counsel Nathan said he recognizes that statistics can be
misleading, but several studies revealed multiple problems
associated with drive-in windows _ from the ease with which minors
obtained alcohol with fake IDs at dimly lit windows to the
difficulties vendors had in determining the sobriety of the
drivers.

SOME ELECTION-YEAR ISSUES FACING THE MASSACHUSETTS HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlton Heston, go get your gun. Because the Massachusetts
House of Representatives is finally getting off the dime on
limiting the availability of assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Heston, the National Rifle Association's Moses-with-an-M-1,
is the public face of the gun lobby, but the backbone of the NRA is
the obdurate refusal of many gun owners to acknowledge that any law
to curb the use of guns by criminals, the deranged, or the
temporarily discombobulated is ipso facto a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Having worn for many months what he acknowledges is ''the
bullseye on my back'' for being the Bad Guy who croaked the assault
weapon ban in his first big test as speaker of the House, Rep. Tom
Finneran (D-Dorchester) jumps into the shark tank Thursday for a
modified, pared-down package of limits on high-powered,
rapid-firing guns.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Ways and Means panel will usher out the 90-page
bill crafted in compromise by Rep. Paul Casey (D-Winchester), House
chair of the Public Safety Committee. Advocates of an outright ban
on the controversial assault weapons, like Sen. Cheryl Jacques
(D-Needham), say the bill is flawed because it still allows
existing assault weapons to be exchanged under slightly stricter
laws requiring a special new license from the owner's local police.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, vows Finneran, the House will begin voting.
In the past, rural and suburban legislators have tended to vote
with gun owners, and city reps to be for tighter restrictions.
Finneran has reached an understanding with Rep. John Slattery
(D-Peabody), an outright-ban advocate, who, the speaker says,
acknowledges the outright-ban forces are shy between six and ten
votes on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Since Slattery's vote was criticial to defeating the capital
punishment bill pushed unsuccessfully by Acting Gov. Cellucci, the
Peabody rep has become a high-profile liberal, and his making
common cause with Finneran and Casey probably enhances chances of
passage Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Finneran argued the bill he's pushing is
aimed at ''weapons of high-capacity -- ten rounds or more to an
ammunition clip -- that can level a restaurant, a schoolyard, or a
train car.'' Notorious shootouts in all those sorts of gathering
places in recent years have fueled a national campaign to cut down
on high-powered, rapid firing pieces that can slay dozens in a
matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''A gun vote has never been easy,'' said Finneran, harder for
some rural reps than a vote to raise taxes, which is the usual
high-water mark for degree of difficulty in this era. A number of
other restrictions aimed at prodding owners to separate ammunition
from the firearm, and new penalties for overly casual storage in
households with children, plus refusal to provide licenses to
owners with outstanding warrants, will be debated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran was excoriated by gun-control advocates in the initial
go-round, because he named to a conference committee on the assault
weapon ban passed in the Senate a legislator, now departed, who
effectively sabotaged the effort. John Rosenthal of Stop Handgun
Violence claimed Finneran caved in to the gun lobby as a payoff to
the 32 (out of 33) Republicans who, in an astonishing manuever,
voted to make him speaker over the front-running Democrat at the
time, Richard Voke.
</P>
<P>
   Having worn the Black Hat as the guy who did in the assault
weapon ban, Finneran makes another foray into the field, this time
expressing cautious hope he can deliver a slim majority of
Democrats for the slimmed-down ban. Finneran points to Slattery's
own head count: ''He can say with more credibility than I that the
Senate version (outright ban) does not have the votes (in the
House).''
</P>
<P>
   If the sort of bill Finneran backs survives the Senate and the
House-Senate horsetrading of a conference committee and reaches the
desk of Gov. Cellucci, predicts Casey, ''He (the governor) will
sign this,'' because it's an election year, and Cellucci presumably
does not want to appear to be in Charlton Heston's satchel.
</P>
<P>
   After a relatively quiet election-year run-up, Finneran's House
seems poised to dispose of a number of issues. Finneran is being
asked by the Roman Catholic Church to facilitate the marshaling of
$4 million in state funds to close a deal to create a 140-unit
family housing project in the South End at the Cathedral of the
Holy Cross under the Archdiocese's Planning Office of Monsignor
Michael Groden.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already approved a $3 million item that would
enable homeless parents who now are denied access to state-run
shelters if they hold a job earning $6.18 an hour to keep working
for as much as $8.50 an hour and still be eligible for staying in a
shelter. Finneran says he's inclined to go for that.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker is resolutely on the sidelines in the Democratic
gubernatorial primary, and will stay there. And he is definitely
sitting on his hands when it comes to crafting legislation to
benefit the New England Patriots and their unending schemes to get
state money for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As a 155-pound center and linebacker in high school, Finneran
has a taste for the game. But Patriots owner, Bob Kraft, he howls,
``wants the taxpayers to buy the land -- and give it back to him!
Hello?'' The huge TV contract the NFL signed makes state aid all
the less likely, Finneran affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Of much more interest to him, he said, is a looming debate on a
major restructuring of the mandatory sentencing framework which
many lawyers and judges claim has created disparities in sentencing
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   With 10,000 prisoners in state cells, and 12,000 more in county
facilities, the burden of confining inmates at the rate of up to
$35,000 per prisoner per year is escalating out of control, he
said. Finneran's legal adviser, Bill Kennedy, has brokered a series
of meetings with judges, district attorneys, public defenders and
others to come up with a compromise set of reforms that will give
judges more leeway, in certain cases, to adjust levels of
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 1.6 million Americans currently behind bars in
this country, and another 400,000 or so paid to guard, feed, doctor
and transport them, the 2 million-man American prison Army is too
costly a solution to America's criminality problems. If Finneran
can manage a sensible start at restraining the lock-'em-up
mentality, that legacy will endure long after his machinations on
the assault weapon ban.
</P>
<P>
   One irony of the departure of Bill Weld from the governor's
office, said Finneran, is that Weld came into power boasting of his
hostility to the convicted. But he turned around some in six years
to the point where ``Weld was prepared to do it (approve sentencing
restructuring). His mind had shifted.'' Where Cellucci's mind will
shift in an election year on the controversial issues of criminal
sentencing is another matter.

CLINTON EXTENDS COASTAL OIL-DRILLING BAN BY 10 YEARS

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEREY, Calif. _ President Clinton, navigating a middle course
between environmentalists and oil companies, announced Friday a
ten-year extension of the current moratorium on oil drilling off
virtually all American ocean coastlines.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also placed several existing marine sanctuaries
permanently off-limits to oil exploration. The areas include the
Channel Islands and Monterey Bay sanctuaries in California, the
Florida Keys, Gray's Reef in Georgia and the Olympic Coast
sanctuary off Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium does not, however, affect areas off the Texas and
Louisiana coasts, where extensive drilling has been going on for
years, nor does it protect any new areas not already covered by the
drilling ban first imposed by President Bush in 1990, including the
coastlines of the Southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, calling the oceans ``the world's last great frontier,''
also signed an executive order Friday to expand programs to
preserve and restore coral reefs in U.S. waters. He proposed new
spending of $6 million to restore 18 damaged reefs in Florida, the
Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking against a sparkling backdrop of Monterey Bay, the
nation's largest marine sanctuary, the president said that offshore
oil activity threatens fish populations and fragile coastal
ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been relatively few drilling-related oil
spills in American waters, Clinton said, ``Even under the best of
circumstances, is it really worth the risk?''
</P>
<P>
   With worldwide oil supplies plentiful and domestic gasoline
prices at near-historic lows, extending the moratorium carries
little political risk for the president.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry, always interested in finding new petroleum
sources, reacted harshly to the president's announcement, saying
that banning further offshore exploration worsens the nation's
dependence on imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   The ban, issued under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act,
covers virtually all of the coasts of the North Atlantic,
California, Washington, Oregon, southwest Florida, New England, the
Mid-Atlantic and the North Aleutian Basin of Alaska, according to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Drilling in these waters is currently banned through 2002; the
president's action would extend that period to 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists would have preferred a permanent ban on all
drilling, but gave Clinton credit for using his executive authority
to halt the activity for an additional 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's commitment is impressive and heartening,''
Mark Massara, director of the Sierra Club's coastal programs, said
in an interview Friday, ``but it doesn't go far enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Clinton used an executive order to extend the ban,
Friday's action could be rescinded by a future president or revoked
in a national oil emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need legislation from Congress to ensure permanent
protection,'' Massara said.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Steiner of the Earth Island Institute was less generous in
his assessment, calling Clinton's action ``a drop in the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's giving us what we already had - a moratorium on
drilling,'' Steiner added. ``It's a politically popular thing to do
but it doesn't really take us anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's largest trade
group, reacted more bitterly. ``The moratoria's extension is
unfortunate because it ignores the near-perfect performance of the
American petroleum industry in operating offshore in a safe and
environmentally sensitive manner,'' said Chris Kelley, a spokesman
for the Institute.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This regrettable decision which is not in the long-term
interests of American consumers is particularly bad policy at a
time of record U.S. energy imports,''he continued, reading a
prepared statement. ``Ultimately, the extension means a smaller
future supply of domestically produced oil and natural gas and a
lost opportunity to create American jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Katie McGinty, chairman of the White House Council on Economic
Quality, said that criticism from environmentalists and the
industry was a sign that the president had found a workable
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has charted the most prudent course here,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used his appearance here, at the first National Oceans
Conference, to announce a number of other proposals, including an
$800 million fund to repair and expand the nation's seaports and a
ban on the sale or import of Atlantic swordfish weighing less than
33 pounds to help sustain swordfish stocks.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced the administration's intention to build two
new deep-sea observatories and to develop two high-technology
undersea probes to explore exotic sea life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We propose to provide new submersibles and other advanced
tools for mapping and exploring the world's last great frontier,''
Clinton said as a sailboat drifted across the bay behind him. ``I'd
kind of like to go down there myself someday.''

SPORTS COLUMN: IN GERMANY, PLAYING SOCCER IS ALL BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Claudio Reyna always thought you played soccer. His
father had been a professional in Argentina and he is a
professional in the United States, and soccer is, at its core, a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went to play in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The first time he practiced with his German club, he was
dribbling the ball blithely when his new chums came blasting in
with sliding tackles associated with the grittiest league games.
</P>
<P>
   This, Reyna thought to himself, is not normal. Well, maybe it
was an initiation rite. They'll get over it.
</P>
<P>
   The next day they held practice on an ash field, not a blade of
grass to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured, `They won't do it here,''' Reyna recalled. ``They
did.'' And he had the bruises to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   This was part of the education of Claudio Reyna and all the
other Yanks who have gone to Germany to make a living with the
hardest footballers on the face of the earth. There is no samba in
Germany, no soccer-mom appeal, no fooling around.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will receive another blunt reminder Monday when
they encounter the hard old boys in their first game of this World
Cup. Germany is the most relentless squad in the universe. Always.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1982 World Cup semifinals, it overcame a 3-1 French lead
_ in overtime, that is. In this rapidly homogenous world of global
television and European unity and Jordanized marketing, the Germans
still come at you like nobody else, opening whistle to closing
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germans are very machine-like,'' said Joe-Max Moore, who
played two years at Saarbrucken and Nurenberg. ``They won't stop.
They are mentally stronger than most countries.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the endearing parts of world soccer is that many national
and ethnic stereotypes not only come true but are actually
celebrated. Brazilians are proud of playing like Brazilians, open
and creative, and Germans are proud of never quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're born with it,'' Moore said. ``They work over there,
not just on the soccer field. They work six days a week over there,
that's all I know. The soccer players work six days a week, two
hours a day. They work every minute of it. That's not normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Being merely soccer players, Moore and Reyna do not have to
worry about being politically correct. They describe what they see
and feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Americans and Germans are very similar,'' Moore said.
``The difference is that Germany has thousands of players to choose
from and we don't. They have guys in the second and third division
who could play for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Paul Caligiuri blazed the trail in Germany in the
mid-'80s, the Germans have been quite receptive to hiring
Americans. Fortunately, there is a double standard of mentality.
The Germans do not expect the Americans to act like them, off the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chad and I went over there, we went to practice in
floppies and shorts and baseball caps,'' recalled Reyna, who now
plays for VfL Wolfsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The German guys were dressed better. They just looked at us.
They like to be informal, too. That's why they love going to
California on vacation. But when they come to work, they work. They
stress being on time. I mean, we weren't late, but we'd get there
right on time and they'd all be looking at us. They're never late
for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dooley admits there is a difference. The son of an
American soldier, he grew up as a German until he qualified for
American citizenship in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came over here, I don't want to say they weren't
organized, but they had more freedom,'' Dooley said of his move to
the States. ``The Germans like more control. If the coach says you
have to stay somewhere, the players do not say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   College educated, ready for an adventure, Dooley has learned
English and is one of the most urbane of the American players, as
well as the new captain. As an adult, he is the equivalent of Doc
Rivers, David Cone, Adam Graves, Buck Williams, athletes who can
talk about life.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Dooley suggested that climate may affect the
personality of the German team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play from the fall to the spring, and if you stand
around, you get cramped up,'' Dooley said. ``You have to train
differently. You have to keep moving for two hours. It takes longer
to get loose, to do your work.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyna expressed the hope that warm weather might hamper the
Germans, as it did in the sun-baked World Cup of 1994 when the
South Koreans nearly caught them in a first-round game in Dallas
and the Bulgarians ran them off in a quarterfinal in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the temperature is warm, they won't like that,'' Reyna
said. ``Eighty degrees is hot for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Yanks, the weather has been downright
fresh, which means they can expect hard times for 90 minutes, as
usual. It could be worse. They could be meeting the Germans on a
field of ashes. &QL;

IN SOME MERGERS, BUYER AND SELLER EMPLOY SAME ADVISER
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the cozy world of corporate finance, bankers and
lawyers are finding themselves straddling both sides of merger
negotiations these days in what some critics say is a risky move
for companies and their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every large Wall Street firm has found itself
representing the interests of both buyers and sellers at one time
or another. It is not illegal, but industry observers question
whether corporate boards should allow the practice to occur at all.
(Bankers typically help negotiate a fair price. Lawyers ensure the
terms of the contract are upheld.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a director, and I would never let someone be on both sides
of the table,'' said Samuel Hayes, a professor of finance at the
Harvard Business School. ``I find that so contrary to my perception
about the way things should work.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Wachtell Lipton Rosen &AMP; Katz provided legal
advice for both Banc One Corp. and First Chicago NBD Corp. in their
$30 billion merger; Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.advised both Italy's Credito
Italiano and Unicredito in their $10 billion combination; and just
this week, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. advised both Norwest Corp.and Wells
Fargo &AMP; Co.on their $34 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and lawyers who specialize in merger negotiations say
dual representation is rare _ more common in the late 1980s than
today _ and only done if a deal is friendly. Wachtell was not
called until after Banc One and First Chicago negotiated most of
the details themselves, including price, bank executives have said.
And in the case of the Italian deal, a Merrill Lynch banker came up
with the idea and pitched it to both companies, so no other bankers
were needed except to give the fairness opinion _ a third-party
assessment of whether an offer appears fair to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Wells Fargo and Norwest, Goldman dispatched two
separate teams, one for each company, and Credit Suisse First
Boston, a unit of CS Holdings, was hired by Wells Fargo to give a
fairness opinion, for some added assurance. Reatha Clark King, a
member of the Norwest board, said the decision to allow Goldman to
represent dual interests was among many issues presented to the
board, including use of the same auditor. ``I felt comfortable it
was an appropriate arrangement,'' she said. A Goldman
representative would not comment on pending transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission said
working for both sides does not pose a conflict if all
relationships are disclosed to investors. Still, said Joseph
Auerbach, a Boston-based merger lawyer, ``It may be legal, but it's
very bad business.''
</P>
<P>
   It is especially troublesome if a third bidder shows up or if a
dispute erupts over the contract. Wells Fargo shareholders, for
instance, have already filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the merger
with Norwest, saying Wells Fargo spurned other potential bidders
and did not shop for the best price, according to news reports.
(Shareholder suits disputing the price of a proposed merger are
common.) U.S. Bancorp, which had its own banker, had expressed
interest early on in buying Wells Fargo, said people close to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rogers, manager of T. Rowe Price's Equity Income fund,
which as of December owned 225,000 shares of Wells Fargo, said
directors should be mindful of the appearance of a conflict,
whether there is one or not. ``Just because it starts out friendly,
doesn't mean it ends up that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And even more companies could become the subject of lawsuits if
investors believe the current wave of merger negotiations have been
mishandled in any way. ``I can't conceive of any person serving my
interests, and the man I'm doing business with,'' said Auerbach.
``There are shareholder lawyers out there who are just looking for
these kinds of cases.'' &QL;

 DON'T PAINT VINYL IF YOU CAN HELP IT
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Q. The painter who is painting my house said that he could paint
all the vinyl windows, which are the new style with a border of
just 1 to 1 1/2 inches wide. The trim is gray-green, and the
painter said painting the vinyl that color would help tie in the
window frames with the trim. Should vinyl windows be painted?
</P>
<P>
   T.D., Jamaica Plain
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No, no, a thousand times no! In fact, the instructions that
come with vinyl windows, or vinyl-clad windows, warn against
painting vinyl. It is not that vinyl cannot be painted, but it does
not need to be. Vinyl or PVC can be painted, but it would be iffy
at best; it must be sanded heavily, then painted with two coats of
a latex house paint. You run the risk of peeling, and if the
gray-green peels, the contrast with the white vinyl under the paint
will make a bigger mess than you have now.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new windows have a very narrow casing, as you said
(1 to 1 1/2 inches), and are a terrible design for a traditonal
house, looking like lidless eyes starting out at you. They might be
OK in a contemporary house, and are no maintenance at all, but they
don't work in a traditional design.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman put one in his house and, instead of letting it be,
put an extra bit of casing around it to match windows already in
place. That ihe case, it's a good idea to get rid of the paint, but
only if some of the brick is being sloughed off. This won't happen
with concrete or concrete blocks, so keep the paint, especially
since it is not peeling; it might be cement-based paint, which is
the best thing you can put on concrete or concrete block because it
penetrates concrete, fills pores, and makes the material water
resistant.
</P>
<P>
   If eventually it starts to peel, then the best thing you can do
is to wire-brush it to get as much off as possible, then let the
rest peel over the next few years and continue to wire brush. With
all the paint off, do not repaint. Concrete and concrete blocks are
straight-forward, honest materials that do not need gussing up.
</P>
<P>
   A good case of painting concrete when it doesn't need it is
Weymouth North High School (now Weymouth High), a series of
ultra-contemporary buildings with a lot of exposed concrete. The
buildings are interesting, even handsome, but someone had the
concrete painted. It peeled, creating an ugly sight and requiring a
continuous repainting chore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a leak in a water pipe in a wall. It is sporadic, but
the pipe is, I believe, fairly small. The plumber said he would
have to open the wall to get to the pipe in order to fix it. Is
there any other way?
</P>
<P>
   WYNN GERHARD, Plymouth
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Not really, because you have to determine what kind of a pipe
it is: water supply (small pipe) and, usually, a steady leak, or a
drain pipe (two or three inches in diamater) and a sporadic leak
because water is in the pipe only when a sink, shower, tub, or
toilet is drained.
</P>
<P>
   If you know where the pipe is, a small part of the wall can be
removed to allow inspection and to locate the leak. Then enough
wall is removed to get to the leak and fix it.
</P>
<P>
   While this is a pain, it is not so difficult to patch a wall. If
the hole or holes are relatively small, you can close them up by
building up layers of joint compound until the hole is closed.
Smooth off, sand smooth, and repaint.
</P>
<P>
   If the hole is large, make it bigger, enough to expose two
studs, being careful to expose half the stud. Cut a plasterboard
patch to insert, nail, or screw it to those exposed studs, and fill
the joints with compound, paper tape, and more compound for an
invisible patch.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am trying to make a ``grave frame'' a frame to hold a
picture for lying on a grave. For the base, I mixed concrete and
poured it in a form. When it cured it, it came out full of holes.
Then I tried using a plug-type concrete (hydraulic) with the same
results. How can I get nice, smooth concrete without holes?
</P>
<P>
   JUDITH MAYER, Halifax
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Make the mix thinner in consistency by adding a bit of water
to it, but not too much because too thin a mix will weaken the
concrete. And, after you pour the thinner concrete in the form (and
it should pour a little, not requiring plopping in vast gobs of
it), puddle the mixture; that is, stick a trowel in the mix several
times, vigorously; this will shake down the concrete so it fills
the form completely, filling any voids that caused previous holes.
And, make sure the stones in the mix are as small as practical.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The wheels of my fertilize spreader no longer move. How can I
get them to go again?
</P>
<P>
   ELIZABETH BERNDT, Woburn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Synthetic fertilizer contains chemicals such as nitrates and
potash, all corroding the metal, freezing up the wheels. Spray WD40
or other dry lubricant on the wheels where they meet the axle. If
that doesn't help, take the wheels off and clean the axle and the
wheel holes with emory cloth. If the corrosion is thick, scrape it
off first, then sand, then lubricate before putting the wheels back
on. If this fails, you will need a new spreader.

`NOT ABOUT NIGHTINGALES' MAKES AN IMPRESSIVE DEBUT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVERETT EVANS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ ``Not About Nightingales'' burns up the stage at the
Aerial Theater, where the rediscovered early Tennessee Williams
prison drama is making its U.S. debut.
</P>
<P>
   That holds true in the most incendiary moments, particularly the
pivotal sequence in which prisoners on a hunger strike are roasted
alive in a hellhole nicknamed ``Klondike.'' Director Trevor Nunn's
riveting production conveys the scene's visceral horror in
unflinching detail, while Richard Hoover's fantastically effective
setting heightens the impact, its gridwork floor allowing searing
light and geysers of steam to burst from below. Who could argue
with one con's description of this torture chamber as ``a little
suburb of hell?''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Nightingales'' blazes with theatricality throughout.
Despite some uneven passages and the overfamiliarity of certain
prison drama archetypes, this long-lost effort by the 27-year-old
Williams is fired with the indignation and raw talent of a young
artist finding his passion and beginning to find his distinctive
voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am at last becoming sincerely aroused in my social
consciousness,'' Williams wrote in his journal at roughly the time
of ``Nightingales''' inception. Little wonder that newspaper
reports of real-life atrocities at a Pennsylvania prison inspired
Williams to write this wild yet powerful rant. It resonates chiefly
on the plight of the incarcerated, but also echoes other
Depression-era concerns, from the dearth of jobs on the outside to
the rise of fascism in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Williams centered his play on the titanic struggle between
hardened prisoner Butch O'Fallon, who leads the hunger strike
seeking decent food, and the monstrous warden Boss Whalen, who
resolves to whip his charges into line with increasingly harsh
punishments, culminating in their trip to Klondike. Butch reflects
Boss Whalen's own thinking in his line, ``a con ain't a human
being.'' Both thuggish power mongers are repeatedly compared to
Mussolini and Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing center stage are two other protagonists, more rounded,
human figures who give the audience an entry into this nightmarish
realm.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Crane arrives at the prison in the opening scene, desperate
to win a job as the warden's stenographer. At the start, she
naively parrots the prison's publicity (``It's supposed to be a
model institution'') to the pitiable mother of a prisoner who has
been driven to a mental breakdown. She gradually awakens to the
terrible truth about Boss Whalen and his operation. Yet she
resolves to ``keep her mouth shut,'' at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Eva falls in love with Canary Jim, a model trusty who is just a
month away from possible parole after 10 years of biting his tongue
and kowtowing to Boss Whalen (for which the other prisoners despise
him). Like Eva, he is caught in the bind between principle and
self-preservation as the prison revolt gathers steam.
</P>
<P>
   Jim is the most frequent outlet for the author's voice _ whether
in his desire to incorporate new words and ideas he has discovered
in his writings for the prison newspaper, or in his musing on the
human condition. When Jim describes ``the wall around every person,
the cage you carry with you, wherever you go,'' one hears early
indications of the Williams who would win fame for works from ``The
Glass Menagerie'' to ``Night of the Iguana.''
</P>
<P>
   One recognizes Williams' sure dramatic instincts at other
points. In one scene, he shrewdly juxtaposes Boss Whalen's most
innocent and most monstrous moments _ baby-talking with his little
girl over the phone, then moments later, recalling how his beatings
broke Jim's spirit and scarred him for life. Elsewhere, in Butch's
dream of seeing his dance-hall girlfriend again, or Eva's final,
breathless plea that she and Jim get a chance at a life together,
flashes of brilliance leap from the surrounding purple.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, however, ``Nightingales'' has less in common
with the mature Williams than with the agitprop Depression-era
dramas of Clifford Odets and 1930s prison flicks. The rising cry of
``Don't eat it'' that launches the hunger strike recalls the
rabble-rousing ``Strike!'' that climaxes Odets' ``Waiting for
Lefty.'' Jim's speech about how the dictionary is ``no good anymore
because we need a new one with a new set of definitions'' echoes
the inevitable moment in Odets plays when an idealist calls for a
new social order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nightingales'' also is informed by such movies as ``The Big
House'' and ``The Last Mile.'' Williams sketches the requisite
prison types: black, Jewish, Hispanic, newly arrived well-to-do kid
who is overly optimistic about his lawyer springing him soon (he is
doomed, of course). The traditional prison-flick touches also are
present: the riot with inmates clanging tin dishes against the
bars, the searchlights seeking out figures hiding in the prison
yard.
</P>
<P>
   Williams jotted onto the news clippings that inspired the play:
``And they say my play is melodramatic!'' Point taken. Even life
sometimes is melodramatic. But somewhere amid this play's melodrama
is a real indictment of an inhumane system and genuine sympathy for
the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's setting underscores the prison movie connection by
depicting a monochromatic world of black, white and gray. The
Aerial Theater has been reconfigured to re-create the Royal
National Theater's Cottesloe Theater in London, where
``Nightingales'' premiered earlier this year. It impresses from the
moment one enters. At one end stands a two-tier block of prison
cells. At the other is the warden's office, backed by a towering
wall of file drawers, the prisoners' lives reduced to statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Within this space, Nunn creates a taut drama, whipping Williams'
sometimes unwieldy saga into shape as decisively as Boss Whalen
controls his cons. His secure grasp of visual and dramatic style,
and deft editing, has made this potentially problematic play into a
coherent whole. The air of anxious anticipation, punctuated by
outbursts of violence, is sustained throughout. Nunn makes
evocative use of the tantalizing hints of the outside world, like
the voices and music from an excursion boat that passes the island
prison.
</P>
<P>
   A strong cast gives its all to this rugged enterprise. Corin
Redgrave's reptilian Boss Whalen is a piece of work, a monstrous
monument to insensitivity. Yet he has just the right touch of
robust bravado to make it believable that Whalen could fool
visitors with his slap-on-the-back posturing.
</P>
<P>
   James Black acts Butch O'Fallon with a rough-hewn vitality and
determination. Brash and cocky, he is plainly in the
Cagney/Robinson tough guy tradition. You believe this guy would
brave the horrors of Klondike in an effort to best Boss Whalen.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Parker Lee makes a Depression heroine of Eva _ desperate,
plucky, increasingly committed to standing up to injustice. Her
portrayal is warm, sympathetic and totally persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   As Canary Jim, Finbar Lynch strikes the right balance between
earthly need and idealistic impulse to make this multifaceted
figure come to life. He makes palpable the character's torment at
being considered a traitor by his fellow cons.
</P>
<P>
   There is vivid work throughout the company. Jude Akuwudike
brings battered dignity to The Queen, the gay inmate lamenting a
lifetime of persecution. Mark Dexter's Swifty deftly illustrates
the newcomer's horrible destruction. Sandra Dickinson contributes
two sharply etched characterizations, as the careworn mother, and
later as Butch's remembered kewpie doll girlfriend, with a
distinctive Shirley Booth voice. Dion Graham is warm and affable as
the well-liked Ollie (doomed, of course). And Tom Hodgkins and
Noble Shropshire register neatly as contrasting chaplains, a
crusader that Whalen fires and the malleable dupe he uses.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Nightingales'' will seem obvious to contemporary
sensibilities _ as in the Jewish prisoner's speech about being born
to persecution. Yet in this potent production, most of it is
undeniably effective.
</P>
<P>
   Williams must have had fire on the brain early in his career.
His first Broadway bound-play, ``Battle of Angels'' (which would
close in Boston in 1941), involved a climactic fire onstage and was
at one point called ``Figures in Flame.'' In ``Not About
Nightingales,'' despite imperfections, the fire of something urgent
to say never dies out.
</P>
<P>
   The play runs through July 3.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Forget about daredevils. Forget about
thrill-seekers who skydive or bungee jump or tame lions for
jollies. And forget about people who don't actually live with their
kids, day by day, sweating out each perilous second of those
childhood years.
</P>
<P>
   Every custodial parent knows that if you really want a real
scare, just kiss your kid goodbye and send that kid out the door. I
raised two. Believe me, those parental terrors gnaw at your gut.
It's the dirty little secret about parenthood that you never find
out about until it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I listened the other day with such sympathy to
Theresa Carrasquillo's story.
</P>
<P>
   She works for the State of New York. She has three kids _ one
11, another 8 and a 5-year-old. Her kids go to the Albany School
for the Humanities. They ride a bus operated by Albany Yellow
Communications, a troubled company that holds the district's bus
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Albany Yellow has had all kinds of problems _ drivers who drink
and drive, kids left on buses. A neighboring district just went to
a judge and got permission to break its contract with the company.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, she put her kids on the school bus the other day
and went to work with that familiar sinking feeling in her middle.
Her kids are supposed to call her when they get home from school.
That day Theresa Carrasquillo received no call. Panic set in.

OPPOSITION RALLY IN NIGERIA IS ANSWERED WITH TEAR GAS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ In the first showdown between Nigeria's
new military leadership and promoters of democracy, hundreds of
protesters braved a powerful deployment of police and soldiers in
Lagos on Friday to mount a demonstration at a downtown market.
</P>
<P>
   After a morning of wary quiet in which schools remained closed
and few people ventured outside, chanting protesters suddenly
turned out in the afternoon near the Yaba market, and witnesses
said the security forces responded with tear gas and shots in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd dispersed, but gathered again, local journalists said,
and the organizer of the demonstration, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, began
to speak. His speech was interrupted by tear gas and he was
arrested, along with Dupe Abiola, wife of Moshood K.O. Abiola, the
presumed winner of Nigeria's last multiparty elections. The
elections, held five years ago Friday, were annulled by the
Nigerian army, and Abiola has been in jail almost ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was planned weeks ago to commemorate that
election. But the rally took on dramatically increased importance
after the sudden death of the country's dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha,
on Monday, reportedly of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha's death has emboldened the opponents of military rule,
many of whom demand that the military make way for Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha's successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has sent mixed
messages about his intentions since being sworn in as president
early Tuesday. A career military man who has never held political
office, he immediately pledged to hand over power to an elected
government by Oct. 1, a promise already made by Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   But the new leader also disappointed those who were hoping for a
departure in the country's policies, when he said he would follow
his predecessor's ``socio-economic program'' in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior Nigerian military officers and former political
advisers say Abubakar has no interest in holding power for himself
and has little regard for the political program of Abacha. They
contend that he is desperately trying to buy time to shore up his
base in the Byzantine military structure and work out a transition
on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar, who has made no public appearances since his short
speech to the nation on Tuesday, was reported Friday to be meeting
with other senior officers and with members of the national
electoral commission in order to revive plans for elections before
October.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the five approved parties have reportedly been
summoned to Abuja, the capital, for meetings with the general this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the army, as well as retired officers and
civilian leaders, began urging Abubakar to scrap his predecessor's
transition plans, either by holding fresh elections, free of
military control, or by bringing Abiola into a transitional
government of ``national unity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody killed Abacha, so nobody should have to carry his
water,'' said Omo Omoruyi, a senior civilian adviser to past
Nigerian leaders. ``Abubakar is going to have to decide if he is
willing to go to the grave known as the man who tried to solve this
country's problems, or as the man who simply tried to fill the seat
until he was carried to his grave.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of Abubakar's first measures was to declare a seven-day
mourning period, perhaps to give himself some breathing space. But
there has been no respite, either from the promoters of democracy,
who see their moment in Abacha's death, or from lobbies within the
military. Some army factions are committed to keeping power; others
would like to see the army return to its barracks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition there are regional rifts in the military:
Northerners have dominated the military regimes and southerners
resent what they say has been their exclusion from executive office
or positions of command.
</P>
<P>
   The rifts are mirrored in civilian politics. While most of the
southern-based opposition groups profess some allegiance to Abiola,
leaders of the Ibo, who fought for secession during the bloody
civil war in the late 1960s, seem to have foreclosed any hope of
common cause.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Abiola should head a government now, Chukwumeka Ojukwu,
a leading Ibo politician and leader of the self-declared Biafran
republic during the civil war, told the BBC: ``Absolutely not.
Adversity is not a qualification for the presidency. There have
been so many wrongs since 1960 that Nigerians must turn the page
and look forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Nigerians express the fear that, as in the past, elements
in the military will exploit the regional and ethnic rifts among
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is whether the civilian politicians have
learned the lessons of the hard years of dictatorship,'' said
Richard Joseph, an expert in Nigerian affairs at Emory University
in Atlanta, who says a united front is critical. ``If not, they'll
just re-open the door for the military.'' &QL;

VIRTUAL REALITY BECOMES A REALITY AT COMPUTER MUSEUM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M.R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somebody, meaning several people working in concert, finally
figured out how to do something interesting with a computer besides
blow up monsters and surf the Web. Not surprisingly, the team
includes the Computer Museum in Boston and the MIT Media Lab. They
hired a local start-up company, Nearlife Inc., whose dozen very
smart techies have been pulling all-nighters at the keyboard for
the last six months to create the Virtual FishTank. This aquarium
made of pixels opens tomorrow on Museum Wharf, and it's a piece of
work. That trite word ``interactive'' suddenly has meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Strimpel, just-departing executive director of the
Computer Museum, for whom the FishTank is the culmination of a
10-year dream, calls it a ``real exhibit of virtual reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is becoming a computer age when people are doing things
remotely _ in time and in space _ and I think a museum should do
the opposite,'' he said. ``This exhibit brings a large group of
people into a big, shared space. Here's this giant wall of a
virtual aquarium and visitors can change the behavior of the fish
in the tank; they can make up their own fish that have their own
behaviors and put them in the tank and see what happens. This isn't
just playing a computer game. People have a maternal-paternal
interest in the fish they build.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several computer stations, all touch-controlled, in
the virtual aquarium room. Visitors to the museum (300 Congress
St.; 617-423-6758) can change the behavior of the four schools of
fish that roam the tank, while at four other stations visitors
create one-of-a-kind fish and drop them into the water. The whole
aquarium can hold up to 20 of the programmed, visitor-made fish at
the same time, a number that will be rarely achieved given that one
of the resident fish schools is severely sharky and the rather
innocent-looking fish in the bottom-feeder school can suddenly
develop an appetite for hapless fish.
</P>
<P>
   What truly astonishes a visitor is the amount of
three-dimensionality on the screens (basically created from a new
Sun Microsystems program, Java 3D). An exaggerated vanishing-point
perspective comes into play as sharks gobble little fishes: Moving
sideways, the sharks look greedy; racing straight toward the
screen, their open mouths gape like very bad dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The visitor-built fish ``allow you to put something of yourself
into the fish tank,'' Strimpel explained. ``It will give you some
sense of what programmers enjoy about their work. You give the fish
some orders _ some commands, so to speak _ and stand back and see
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchel Resnick, an MIT professor and head of the charmingly
named Learning and Common Sense section at the MIT Media Lab,
collaborated on the concept of the Virtual FishTank, although the
complicated graphics and programming required the work from
Nearlife. He remarked that his group, and a start-up enterprise,
Toys of the Future, were trying to move computer use from passive
interaction and simple game-playing. ``I call it cotton-candy
computing power,'' Resnick said. ``A lot of fancy equipment and
what do you get, intellectual spun sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get `learning by experience' into the computer
world, and not by learning how to do technical programming, but
just getting games and toys out there where you get to change the
rules,'' he added. ``I think the FishTank is an example.'' Resnick
said Toys of the Future would introduce, through the Lego company,
a programmable block that could become the motor drive for Lego
constructions. ``It's interesting that the entertainment and toy
industry are driving the computer business; that's where the fancy
graphics and really indestructible computer components are coming
from.'' The Media Lab has six learning stations at one end of the
aquarium exhibit, where some of the principles of the giant fish
tank can be worked out in a less complex environment.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsley Galyean, founding president of Nearlife, spent this
week, like the last six months, on the case in the virtual
aquarium. He's still happy in his work. Nearlife's specialty is
software that makes critters move, well, as if they nearly were
alive, and Galyean occasionally does speak of the characters on the
aquarium projection screens as if they really were, and had minds
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   When they were tuning up the particular screen where
visitor-made fish are introduced to the tank, they added a shark,
which would occasionally eat one of the new arrivals. Galyean
pointed to the virtual pipe through which the virtual fish
virtually swim into the virtual aquarium and said, ``The shark,
after a while, figured out that it didn't have to swim all over the
tank, it could just swim up to the pipe and snap them up the minute
they came out.'' Naturally, this shark has been, as they say of
human fanatics, ``de-programmed.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be an interesting exhibit even for grandparents who
have no interest at all, or who won't admit to any interest, in
building their own fish or programming their own school of
predators and prey. With a dozen large screens, with at least 40 or
50 fish doing something interesting, with bright colors, sharp
graphics, and the sound of waves, water, and snapping teeth, it's a
show for couch potatoes and wannabe programmers alike.

GOLDMAN, SACHS PARTNERS HUDDLE TO STUDY PUBLIC OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The partners of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. met at a
suburban New York conference center Friday to consider a proposal
to turn the firm, Wall Street's last major private partnership,
into a public company.
</P>
<P>
   The 190 partners are debating strategy, including the
possibility of a public sale of shares. Half a dozen times in
recent years they have considered the same question and elected to
stay private. Some partners have indicated that they do not favor a
public offering at this time.
</P>
<P>
   But some Goldman bankers have said that the stock market's high
level and Goldman's own rich profits _ it is expected to earn more
than $2 billion in this year's first half compared with $3 billion
for all of last year _ make this the best time in recent history to
sell shares.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Goldman faces intense competitive pressures from many
of its rivals, which are already public firms.
</P>
<P>
   The partners have often held their annual retreat at the Doral
Arrowwood resort in Rye Brook, N.Y.. This year, however, the firm
selected a more secluded site, the Palisades Executive Conference
Center, in Palisades, N.Y. A receptionist at the conference center
confirmed that several Goldman partners were there, but said that
she had instructions to block all telephone calls to the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   A Goldman spokesman said the firm would probably announce on
Sunday whether or not the partners backed the plan to go public. &QL;

CRIME WAVE THREATENS COLONY'S HANDOVER TO CHINA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACAO _ Not long ago, this Portuguese enclave on the south China
coast was considered a sleepy tourist destination, as famous for
its cobblestone alleys and European-style churches as its neon-lit
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Macao is better known as a modern-day Casablanca, a mecca
for organized crime, loan-sharking, prostitution, and money
laundering, and the picturesque backdrop for gangland killings.
</P>
<P>
   With just 18 months before Macao returns to Chinese rule, a
high-profile crime wave is threatening a smooth handover. Led by
gangs that skim profits from the legal gambling industry, the
violence could undermine good relations between China and Portugal,
the economic and social future of this 450-year-old port town and
the image of a happily reunified China.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Macao's hit men targeted rival gangsters and spared
law-abiding citizens. But the recent executions in broad daylight
of three security officials _ a top gambling inspector, a marine
policeman, and the driver for the secretary for security _ have
frightened away tourists and investors and rocked the tight-knit
community. And for the first time in otherwise harmonious
negotiations over the transfer of power, recriminations have flown
between Beijing and Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing views Macao's return on Dec. 20, 1999, as the next step
in the reunification of China after the handover last year of Hong
Kong, its richer neighbor 38 miles to the east. The example of
Macao running its own affairs, Beijing believes, might persuade
Taiwan to rejoin China with promises of self-rule. But if
disintegrating order in Macao forces Beijing to renounce its
hands-off vow, both Macao's autonomy and Taiwanese unification
sentiment will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong residents feared that Chinese rule would erode their
civil rights. Ironically, the crime wave in Macao has made many
residents eager for a speedier return to China or for Chinese
intervention before the handover. They consider Beijing to be tough
on crime and Lisbon overly concerned with the rights of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management of this territory is laid-back, and it
shouldn't be. People do (crime) because they know they are not
going to get caught,'' said Edmund Ho, a prominent banker and vice
president of Macao's legislative assembly, who is the front-runner
to become Macao's first Chinese leader after the handover.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, he said, ``The whole framework for the handover
was `no change,' because Hong Kong was considered so successful.
Unfortunately, we don't have a `successful Macao experience.' The
transition is an opportunity to make change and make things right.
... After 1999, Macao will be better.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the famous debates in Hong Kong over the preservation of
democracy, Ho said Macao people ``are more concerned about economic
issues and security.''
</P>
<P>
   Leong Heng-kao, a pro-Beijing legislator, has called on China to
send troops to Macao after the handover, and many average citizens
agree. ``The Chinese government is strict and they have the death
penalty. I want China to come now,'' said Lao Kin-chang, a
43-year-old security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese officials defend Macao's record by pointing out that
crime here is still low relative to major cities, and residents
should be thankful that human rights are not compromised. Macao
will retain its criminal code after the handover. The death penalty
will remain outlawed, although it exists in China. Similarly,
gambling will remain legal here, though banned in China.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Colonel Manuel Geraldes, adviser to the Secretary for
Security, notes that even with 29 homicides last year, a 40 percent
rise over 1996, the murder rate in this territory of 450,000 people
ranks significantly lower than those of Washington or Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a false image of Macao,'' Geraldes complained. ``We
have problems in Portugal too, and we feel safer here than in
Lisbon.'' Overall crime here fell 2.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   But many residents say the perception of Macao as a lawless city
of sin stems from the willingness of ``triad'' gangsters to carry
out their vendettas in public.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 11 murders and some 100 firebombings this year,
including attacks on police property. On March 24, a top gambling
inspector was assassinated on the city's busiest avenue at
lunchtime, a block from the main casino where police cars were
stationed. Two days later, a police officer was shot to death in
morning rush hour traffic with his wife and daughter in the car
with him.
</P>
<P>
   In a display of disdain for authorities, the man believed to be
the boss of Macao's biggest triad gave media interviews a few
months ago to promote ``Casino,'' a movie he financed that
glorifies his life as a gangster. He even managed to shoot key
scenes in Macao, despite the government's rejection of his
application for a filming permit.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, Wan Kuok-koi, or ``Broken Tooth Koi,'' was
arrested at the LisboaCQ Hotel, home to the city's most famous
casino, 12 hours after the Judicial Police Director narrowly
escaped death when a bomb destroyed his car. Wan remains in
custody, thanks to anti-triad laws that took effect last year.
</P>
<P>
   More than 135 people have been arrested under the new laws,
including three charged this week. The new code allows video and
audiotapes as evidence and punishes triad membership with up to 10
years in prison. Since the law went into effect, police say they
have arrested twice as many suspects as during the same period a
year ago. And since the bombing of the police director's car, the
campaign has intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Many Macao residents accustomed to the leniency of the
Portuguese _ or the corruption and intimidation of authorities _
are stunned by these statistics. They are used to sagas like the
trial last year of Wan for triad membership. A judge found him
innocent and then retired unexpectedly the next day to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police have been corrupted since the early days of
gambling here,'' alleged one well-connected native who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``If they want to put someone in jail, they
should start with the top echelons of government and go on down.''
</P>
<P>
   Geraldes admits the police force is ``not pure,'' noting that 34
officers were dismissed last year. But the majority, he said, are
simply outnumbered in the battle against crime. Wan's triad, 14K,
has 10,000 local members _ compared with 4,300 police officials.
Police say the problem is compounded by additional criminals from
China.
</P>
<P>
   Some frustrated Chinese officials have criticized Portugal
publically for trying to pass the crime problem on to them. But
this week, Chinese police arrested several hundred suspected drug
traffickers and prostitutes in Zhuhai, the Chinese city that
borders Macao. Portugal has dispatched intelligence agents here and
promised to send extra crimefighters from Lisbon within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet crime has already taken its toll on Macao's economy, which
is heavily dependent on gambling and tourism. More than a quarter
of the territory's gross domestic product comes from gaming, and
the government earns half its revenue from gambling taxes, which
fell in April to a three-year low, according to the Macao Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist arrivals, which consist mostly of casino visitors, fell
14 percent from 1996, and one hotel executive said her business was
down 30 percent. On a recent afternoon, Chinese and Russian
prostitutes and loansharks trolling for customers outnumbered
tourists in the LisboaCQ Hotel lobby.
</P>
<P>
   While neighboring Hong Kong is an international financial
center, Macao has few big enterprises apart from casinos, and city
officials worry that Macao's failure to diversify will eventually
render it a seedy backwater.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities here say the crime wave stems from Asia's economic
downturn, which has thrown triads into battle for diminishing
gambling-related profits. The more painful truth is that Macao's
recession and turf battles predated the downturn. Efforts to lure
investors with a new airport and modern offices have been
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   But the self-rule promised by Beijing after the handover will
force the residents here to find solutions for the crime wave and
the depressed economy behind it, according to Domingo Fezaz Vital,
diplomatic adviser to the Governor of Macao.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macao people are learning from Hong Kong next door the price
of autonomy and what it means. They are conducting their business,
and we'll have to do the same,'' said Vital. ``Dad and Mom will not
come. They will help as best they can, but Macao will have to solve
its own problems.''

<P>
   EL CHARCO, Mexico _ The stucco walls of the two-room schoolhouse
are gouged with hundreds of bullet holes and stained with patterns
of dried blood: a handprint that slides downward, a broad wash that
spills into a thick puddle on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   These are what remains of a three-hour shootout on Sunday
morning at the hilltop school between army troops and armed
fighters whom the authorities have identified as members of a
clandestine rebel group, the Popular Revolutionary Army. At least
11 civilians were killed, five were wounded and 27 people, who were
inside the school but survived the army barrage, were detained. The
army reported no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials and Mixtec Indian inhabitants of this
drought-scorched hamlet have accused the army of using excessive
force to subdue about a dozen guerrillas who holed up in the
schoolhouse along with dozens of farming families from the area
they had invited to a daylong meeting to discuss local problems.
</P>
<P>
   The incident has reawakened the bitterness that still lingers in
the state of Guerrero, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast, over the
killings of 17 peasant farmers by state police on a rural road in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a different type of violence. It revealed that the
insurgency of the Popular Revolutionary Army, known by its initials
in Spanish as the EPR, has continued to percolate in the mountains
of Guerrero even though the group has refrained from conspicuous
attacks and faded from newspaper headlines.
</P>
<P>
   The group made its first spectacular military appearance on Aug.
28, 1996, when it mounted small-scale but coordinated attacks in at
least six Mexican states. But since then it has engaged only in
minor skirmishes with police and army troops in isolated rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Zapatista Indian rebels in the southern state of
Chiapas, the EPR, which is descended from some of the most radical
leftist groups of the 1980s, has never had support from mainstream
Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   But in Guerrero, whose rugged mountains have been home to
generations of rural guerrillas, it has continued to operate. The
guerrillas have often been welcomed in hamlets like El Charco,
where the Indians live on the low end of subsistence and expect
that the government will treat them at best with neglect and at
worst with racist violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, four days after the combat in El Charco, open
fighting also broke out, for the first time in more than three
years, between army and police troops and Zapatista guerrillas in
Chiapas. The long fire fight in the Indian community of Chavajeval
began after the government forces moved in to break up an
alternative village government set up by the Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   According to accounts from villagers and the testimony of
several prisoners to the federal police, the people here did not
think it unusual when about a dozen masked and armed rebels marched
through the hamlet on Saturday morning and convened an all-day
meeting in the school, attended mainly by Indians from other
outlying hamlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The EPR comes here a lot,'' said a 28-year-old Mixtec woman
whose adobe hut stands just above the schoolyard. Still frightened
by the bloodshed, she did not wish to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always treat us very well, and they teach the young men
how to fight in case there is a war,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the guerrillas committed a surprising error for a group
known for its attention to security. Apparently overconfident of
their safety in a valley they had visited many times, they let the
farmers who attended the daytime meeting spend the night on the
cement floor of the main schoolrooms while they slept in an annex
behind. They did not set up a security perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the army troops were on a routine anti-drug patrol, as
generals have asserted, or received a tip from a pro-government
villager, as some other residents believe, by the early hours of
Sunday hundreds of them had surrounded the school. The troops
caught the guerrillas while most of them were asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Ministry officials said the troops had repeatedly called
on the armed fighters to surrender. But the Mixtec woman said she
had heard the troops shouting, ``We're going to kill you all!''
Officials of the surrounding county said other villagers had told
them that the civilians inside called out that they were ``peaceful
people'' and had no weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how the shooting began, but it was thick and
dragged on until after sunrise. Federal investigators who
questioned the prisoners said on Wednesday that one of them, a
woman who admitted to being an EPR military commander, testified
under oath that other guerrillas had tried to ``break the military
circle'' by charging the army troops.
</P>
<P>
   The army fed suspicion by closing the hamlet to journalists and
human rights observers for 24 hours. The federal civilian police
said they had found 14 AK-47 combat rifles in the schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrilla fighters responded by painting walls and hold fleeting
demonstrations in at least eight Guerrero towns over the last two
days. &QL;

IOWA EVENT POINTS TO WIDE-OPEN RACE FOR GOP NOMINATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ It was billed as the first major meeting of
Republican presidential prospects, and the ``First in the Nation
Gala'' had all the trimmings: a dozen candidates, 2,500 Iowa's GOP
activists, a C-Span television broadcast, and a national press
contingent.
</P>
<P>
   But last night's gathering was most notable for what was
missing. There was no self-proclaimed moderate, no elder statesman,
no front-runner _ and no obvious signal about who will become the
GOP nominee in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The message from Iowa, which traditionally holds the first major
presidential caucus, is that the Republican Party is about to
embark on one of the most wide open races for the presidential
nomination in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no one ahead right now,'' said Iowa
Republican Party chairman Steve Grubbs. ``It is completely up in
the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The most visible prospects here were two men who lost out in
1996, Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes, as well as Senator John
Ashcroft of Missouri and Representative John Kasich of Ohio. But
several possible key players such as Texas Governor George W. Bush
and former Vice President Dan Quayle didn't show up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the state's Republican convention provided insights that
will be studied by those who are considering entering the contest.
The pre-campaign is focused on a two-pronged strategy, with most of
the prospects vowing to cut taxes and seeking to woo religious
conservatives, especially those affiliated with groups such as the
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key to winning elections on the Republican side is
to energize both of the currents in the Republican river,''
Ashcroft said. ``There is both the economic current and the social
current.''
</P>
<P>
   While Iowa is a relatively moderate state, voting for Clinton in
the last two elections, the Republican caucuses are well known for
being dominated by religious conservatives. According to 1996 exit
polls, 40 percent of those who participated in the GOP caucuses
considered themselves religious conservatives. The conventional
wisdom is that any candidate who can gain the support of about
15,000 such activists has a good shot at winning the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Grubbs said, that leaves plenty of room for a more
moderate, establishment-oriented candidate to show up and stake a
claim on the remaining 60 percent of the caucus-goers. But so far,
no one has emerged to claim that ground, perhaps because of the
abysmal showing of 1996's moderate candidates, Senator Richard
Lugar of Indiana and Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. Grubbs
said he invited New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman, one of
the party's leading moderates, but she declined to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the prospects came here hoping to sign up activists for
possible campaigns, while some came simply to float their names.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Marc Racicot of Montana, who prompted no quarrel when
he introduced himself as nationally unknown, fell into the latter
category. With his slightly bemused manner and telegenic looks, the
49-year-old governor evoked comparisons with the way a little-known
Arkansas governor ran for president. Racicot, the only candidate
who sat through a news conference of his colleagues, prompted
laughter when he said, ``This is a very unusual culture I have been
introduced to.'' He declined to attack anyone, saying, ``I don't
have no particular ax to grind.'' Asked to cite a major issue, he
said he favored the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act
and a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the talk here centered on three men who didn't show up:
Bush, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and House Speaker Newt
Gingrich of Georgia. Bush and McCain have said they won't get
involved in presidential politics until they win reelection this
November, while Gingrich has expressed interest in the race but
declined to participate in early cattle shows.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Alexander may have the best organization in Iowa, with
plenty of money to spread around from his political action
committee, which is chaired by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad.
Alexander, thanks partly to the residual effect of his 1996 race,
also has the support of Iowa's House speaker and numerous other
high-profile politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander is portraying himself as a different candidate
than the one who placed third here in 1996. In the last campaign,
Alexander was known mostly for his red plaid shirt and his call for
cutting Congress' pay.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday Alexander switched tactics by proposing a new tax
code, including a doubled deduction for charitable contributions
and an increase in the child exemption to 8,000 from $2,650 for
preschool children.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you will see from me is less red-and-black shirt and more
talk about character,'' Alexander said in an interview. ``Not just
Mr. Clinton's character, but the character of the country. There
will be less talk about `cut their pay and send them home,' and
more talk about taking responsibility for children.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, a millionaire publisher who was widely perceived as
trying to buy his way to victory in Iowa in 1996, this time is
combining an aggressive media campaign with old-fashioned tactics
such as visiting as many Kiwanis clubs as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Forbes's strategy is trying to remold himself as a
social conservative instead of simply being known for his flat-tax
plan. Forbes recently took the unusual step of endorsing two
Christian Coalition leaders who ran for the state legislature
against incumbent Republicans in a primary earlier this month. Both
candidates lost, but his endorsements were, as he hoped, popular
among religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing a moral crisis in this country,'' Forbes said.
``I've endorsed a number of kindred souls.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes faces a lot of competition for the religious
conservative vote. Alan Keyes, the radio talk-show host who ran for
president in 1996, lashed out at Forbes as a ``phony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes's professed interest in the moral agenda is totally
false,'' Keyes said at a candidate news conference, noting that
Forbes has supported Republicans such as New Jersey's Whitman, who
favors abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, the House Budget Committee chairman whose hopes rely
partly on his image as a hip conservative who balances budgets and
listens to the Grateful Dead, got a taste of the kind of questions
that await him as a presidential candidate. Asked how he would deal
with a widely discussed computer bug that could devastate many
computers on Jan. 1, 2000, Kasich said, ``First, I need to learn
how to get on the Web myself,'' referring to the Internet's World
Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, the former vice president, citing a scheduling conflict,
sent his wife Marilyn to the gala. The other prospects who attended
included: Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Representative Bob
Barr of Georgia, former Reagan White House aide and talk-show host
Oliver North, and former Reagan aide and Family Research Council
head Gary Bauer.

A SCHOOL BUS RIDE TO AVOID 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Forget about daredevils. Forget about
thrill-seekers who skydive or bungee jump or tame lions for
jollies. And forget about people who don't actually live with their
kids, day by day, sweating out each perilous second of those
childhood years.
</P>
<P>
   Every custodial parent knows that if you really want a real
scare, just kiss your kid goodbye and send that kid out the door. I
raised two. Believe me, those parental terrors gnaw at your gut.
It's the dirty little secret about parenthood that you never find
out about until it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I listened the other day with such sympathy to
Theresa Carrasquillo's story.
</P>
<P>
   She works for the State of New York. She has three kids _ one
11, another 8 and a 5-year-old. Her kids go to the Albany School
for the Humanities. They ride a bus operated by Albany Yellow
Communications, a troubled company that holds the district's bus
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Albany Yellow has had all kinds of problems _ drivers who drink
and drive, kids left on buses. A neighboring district just went to
a judge and got permission to break its contract with the company.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, she put her kids on the school bus the other day
and went to work with that familiar sinking feeling in her middle.
Her kids are supposed to call her when they get home from school.
That day Theresa Carrasquillo received no call. Panic set in.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she called Albany Yellow Communications. Where are my
kids, she wanted to know?
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, `We've been trying to call you.' Well, I'd been
at my desk for like an hour and a half, waiting for my kids to
call, which I usually do. Then they told me, `Well, all your kids
are at St. Peter's Hospital. One is complaining of her ankle
hurting, and the other two seem OK.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I get over there, and a police officer told me what
happened. He said the bus driver got distracted. She got on the
wrong side of the road, and she hit a truck. And that's how my
daughter got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter has my work number. When I got to the hospital, it
was right there on her paperwork ... So whoever was at the scene of
the accident, they had my number. They could have called
immediately. No one called.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How's her ankle?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's broken. It's fractured in the growth plate, and she
dislocated her fibia.''
</P>
<P>
   So this was no minor accident, and Theresa Carrasquillo is badly
bent out of shape that she had to find out on her own that her kid
had been seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   What does the bus company have to say about this? They say they
called Theresa Carrasquillo at work and were told she wasn't there.
And then she called them.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said that they hold off contacting parents
until paramedics have an assessment of an injured child's
condition. The district said Theresa Carrasquillo's phone was busy,
and nobody thought to ask an operator to break in.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Carrasquillo says, by the way, that when she's on her
work phone any incoming call rolls over to a secretary's line. And,
she says, she was there, all right.
</P>
<P>
   So believe whomever you please. But the incident points up
broader problems.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, most student records are kept in the schools, not
in the Albany district's central offices. If a kid gets hurt on a
bus after school closes, getting a parent's phone number can be a
chore.
</P>
<P>
   The district hopes to have a central computer operation going by
the end of next year. But this is stone-age stuff for a district
that spends 99 million bucks a year and serves 10,000 kids.
</P>
<P>
   It'll now have three fewer children to transport, however. For
the rest of this school year, Theresa Carrasquillo has decided,
she'll find some other way to get her kids to and from school.
</P>
<P>
   She figures that'll be easier on her stomach.

THOUSANDS OF U.S. OPEN TICKETS STOLEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More than 6,000 tickets to the U.S. Open were
reported stolen from an office at the Olympic Club's golf course,
where next week's tournament will be held, the San Francisco police
said. The tickets are worth as much as $360,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime between 7 p.m. Tuesday and 8 a.m. Wednesday, at least
one burglar entered an unlocked window in the second story
clubhouse of the Olympic Club, taking two boxes of tickets, police
Lt. Dirk Beijen said. The burglar apparently got easy access to the
window from a low roof nearby, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   No other items were reported missing. The police said they had
no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have a lot to go on,'' Beijen said. ``What we
do have we're not talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities fear the stolen passes will flood the scalper
market and cause confusion next week if unwitting fans buy bad
tickets and are refused admission.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Golf Association said Thursday everyone who
has paid for a ticket or is entitled to a pass from sponsors will
receive a legitimate pass.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said the stolen tickets included a mix of day passes
and weekly packages for the event, including many set aside for
corporate sponsors, players and other VIPs.
</P>
<P>
   The event, one of golf's most prestigious tournaments, sold out
in less than 10 hours almost a year ago. Tickets were $30 for a day
for each of the three practice rounds and $60 for each of the four
tournament days. A weeklong pass sold for $225, but in the past
week scalpers have been offering them for as high as $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The spectator gallery is expected to include about 25,000 paying
fans each day of the tournament. In addition, there also will be
more than 5,000 other people there, including volunteers,
employees, players and guests of sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   A USGA spokesman said security officials would not admit anyone
bearing a ticket with the serial numbers of stolen passes. Police
said all the missing tickets had either a two-inch ``W'' or ``O''
on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be taking more precautions than normal,'' said Mike
Butz, USGA deputy executive director. ``Anybody who tries to access
the golf course (with a stolen pass) during the open will not be
admitted.''
</P>
<P>
   The field for this year's event includes 156 of golf's best
players competing for a purse of $3 million with the winner getting
$535,000.

NEW TRIAL GRANTED IN DAY-CARE SEX-ABUSE CASE  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.C., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Handing a major victory to the defense in one
of the country's longest-running day-care sexual abuse cases, a
Massachusetts judge ruled Friday that the children in the case had
been so manipulated in interviews by the prosecutors that their
testimony was ``forever tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that ``Justice was not done,'' Judge Isaac Borenstein
of Superior Court granted a new trial to Cheryl Amirault LeFave,
one of three family members convicted in the highly publicized
Fells Acres Daycare Center case. He also dismissed all charges
against Ms. LeFave's mother, Violet Amirault, posthumously. She
died of cancer in September at age 74.
</P>
<P>
   But the aspect of Borenstein's ruling that may have the broadest
implications for other cases around the country, prosecutors said,
was his assertion that in Ms. LeFave's new trial, the children
whose evidence made the prosecution's case should not be allowed to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's concerning because not only did he determine that the
interviews in the case were improper, he determined that the
children could not testify,'' said Lynn Rooney, chief of the Family
Protection Unit in the Middlesex County district attorney's office.
``He's in effect found her not guilty, because without the
children, we don't have a case that we can prosecute.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution will appeal the ruling to the Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court, she said, and if the appeal fails, will
consult with the families involved about whether they could endure
another trial, more than a decade after the first.
</P>
<P>
   Fells Acres is one of the last cases pending among the wave of
major day-care sexual-abuse trials in the 1980s _ including
California's McMartin preschool case, the Little Rascals Day Care
Center in Edenton, N.C., and the Wee Care Day Nursery in Maplewood,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the convictions in those cases have been overturned
as questions have mounted over whether interviewers had prodded
suggestible children into fabricating stories of abuse. But groups
that work on behalf of defendants said Friday's ruling may help the
hundreds of people falsely accused of child sexual abuse in
day-care or custody cases who remain in jail.
</P>
<P>
   James Sultan, Ms. LeFave's lawyer, said that when the Amirault
case was tried in the mid-1980s, ``It was really the dark ages of
child sex-abuse investigations, and people didn't know how to
question children properly. And at the time, the prevailing wisdom
was that you really had to push and prod, and `Don't take no for an
answer' was the mantra of the investigator at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he argued successfully before the court, more than a
decade of research has shown that children are so suggestible that
they tend to give questioners the answers questioners want, and
then to believe what they have said. The 1993 exoneration of
Margaret Kelly Michaels in the Wee Care case also hinged on flawed
interviewing, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein had viewed videotapes of the children's
interrogations, and read aloud excerpts of transcripts in his
ruling Friday to show how the questioners pushed children into
answers. Afterward, he said, ``On and on and on, refusing to take
no for an answer, and it's only one example of the overwhelming
evidence in this case of how investigators, however
well-intentioned, just would not take no, and overwhelmed these
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan said the ruling held particular promise for the third
defendant in the Amirault case, Ms. LeFave's brother Gerald
Amirault, who is in prison serving a sentence of 30 to 40 years and
was convicted on the same evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Amirault, who was an aide and driver at the Malden, Mass., day
care center that Violet Amirault had run for more than 20 years,
was accused of taking the center's children, who were between 3 and
5 years old, into a ``magic'' or ``secret'' room to molest them.
Children gave accounts of being tied naked to a tree, being
attacked by a clown, being raped with objects and being forced to
watch the Amiraults kill birds.
</P>
<P>
   Though the news was good for Cheryl LeFave Friday, she cried in
court ``because her Mom wasn't there to hear this vindication,''
Sultan said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ms. LeFave told reporters that the judge, ``validated
everything that my family has been fighting for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any abuse in Fells Acres,'' she said. ``And my
God, my mother, God rest her soul, her business was taken from her.
My mother created a community in Malden that was impeccable. And
I'm here to raise her name.''

BLACKS CALL FOR DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS SLAYING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A call for retribution echoed Friday through
this town where a native son fell victim to an atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vengeance is mine, said the Lord,'' said the father of James
Byrd Jr., who died early last Sunday when he was beaten, chained by
his ankles to the back of a truck, and dragged two miles along a
rutted asphalt road in what police called a racially-motivated hate
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want is justice,'' James Byrd Sr. said, ``and fair
justice is the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   In his call for capital punishment, Byrd voiced the sentiment of
much of the black community in this east Texas town 90 miles from
the prison that houses the state's oft-used execution chamber. But
the Baptist deacon's view also reflects growing support among
blacks nationwide for the death penalty, a trend that collides with
the views of leading civil rights groups and leaders, including the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is scheduled to speak today at Byrd's
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   After opposing capital punishment for decades, a majority of
blacks _ 57 percent _ support the penalty, according to a poll last
year by the National Opinion Center at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged by senseless slayings and searching for stronger
sanctions, increasing numbers of blacks have put their faith in
legal executions despite statistics that show it has long been a
penalty enforced disproportionately against blacks, even as it is
rarely used _ particularly in Texas _ to punish those who murder
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, two top officers in the Texas chapter of the National
Association for Colored People, an organization resolutely opposed
to capital punishment, have called for the death penalty for Byrd's
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Three Jasper parolees identified by police as white supremacists
are charged with the slaying: Robert Russell Brewer, 31, John
William King, 23, and Shawn Berry, 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP is on record against the death penalty for a number
of good reasons,'' said Lee Alcorn, president of the group's Dallas
branch as he stood outside the jail where the three suspects are
being held without bail. ``But this case is just so gruesome that
if they get the death penalty, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, the NAACP's national president, issued a statement
that did not directly address the issue, though his tone was harsh.
``These cowards,'' Mfume said, ``should never walk the streets
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's murder has changed the beliefs of many in Jasper, where
he was known as an affable amateur musician who had been down on
his luck in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, 49, who had served prison time for theft and forgery, was
walking home from a family party late Saturday night when the three
suspects, including one who recognized Byrd from the parole office,
offered him a ride.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, the three drove Byrd to a remote dirt road,
where they beat and kicked him before they chained him to the
pickup truck and dragged him along the road, tearing his body to
pieces. Byrd's head, neck, right arm and torso were scattered along
the route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many will say it, but this incident has caused a lot of
people in the community to look differently at the death penalty,''
said Gloria Mays, editor and publisher of the East Texas
Communicator, the region's black newspaper. ``A lot more people are
for it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mays said the incident, the cruelest act she has encountered
since she was a child and saw her father's horse abused, hardened
her support for capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should die for what they did because no human being
should be treated that way,'' Mays said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas prosecutors, rarely hesitant about seeking the death
penalty, said they must be able to prove the three men
intentionally kidnapped Byrd before killing him, to satisfy state
standards for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Since capital punishment was reinstated in 1982, Texas has led
the nation in executions, with more than 150.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper District Attorney Guy James Gray made it clear he wants
to seeks the death penalty in Byrd's case. And as backup, an FBI
task force is investigating the incident as a federal hate crime,
which also can be punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   When Byrd is buried tomorrow, few mourners are likely to share
Jackson's opposition to the death penalty, which he reiterated in a
visit to Jasper earlier this week. Several other members of Byrd's
family said they favor the death penalty, as did the Rev. Kenneth
Lyons, pastor of the New Bethel Baptist Church, where the funeral
will be held.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons said Jackson ``has to speak for political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't,'' Lyons said. ``I have to speak for the truth,
and that's God's word: He who shall take a life shall also have to
give up his life.''
</P>
<P>
   From the parish house to the paved road where Byrd suffered his
fatal indignity, revulsion at the crime was so prevalent it was
hard to find black residents of Jasper who opposed the death
penalty in this case.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few foes was M.L. Traylor Jr., a distant relative of
Byrd who lives on the road where he died. ``I'm sorry, but I don't
believe in the death penalty,'' Traylor said. ``I don't think
anyone should take anyone else's life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the birth of Euroland less than seven months away, it's
high time for a deep rethinking of how American investors approach
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Euroland is popular shorthand for the one-currency, 11-country
monetary union and financial market area that will come into being
on Jan. 1. It brings with it many promising opportunities for
companies and investors alike.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it threatens to make some familiar investing
strategies obsolete, and it raises the question of whether betting
on just this single-currency market is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have shown a surging interest recently in Europe, with
record flows of cash into European stock mutual funds. But the
American financial services industry does not appear to be in a
rush to change what it is now offering its investors and seems to
be ignoring products like a Euroland index fund or a broad choice
of actively managed Euroland mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some argue that focusing on just the 10 active Euroland
stock markets (Luxembourg has none) would mean missing good returns
elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Euroland concept, from a narrow perspective of creating
funds, is a flawed one,'' said Nicholas Bratt, the head of the
global equity group at Scudder Kemper Investments. ``We would
simply buy the best company we could find in Europe regardless of
is specific domicile.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors face more questions than just geography. The role that
indexes and index funds will play in the new region's markets is
far from certain. And perhaps most important is the developing
shift to a new investing style that selects stocks by sector rather
than by country. Here is how these themes may play out in the new
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Before Euroland, European equity strategists began by picking a
country, based on the forecast for interest rates, growth, earnings
and inflation. Then they chose stocks in countries with the best
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   That system, analysts argue, will not be as effective now,
because the new European Central Bank will try to keep interest
rates and economic performance more in line for all Euroland
countries.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean there will not be differences within
Euroland, but it does mean that the era of making millions by
exploiting them is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it will be what sectors are most promising and what are
the best stocks in that sector,'' said William P. Sterling, global
strategist at BEA Associates, an investment management firm.
</P>
<P>
   This new style spells trouble for popular closed-end
single-country funds which, unless they adapt, will struggle to
produce attractive returns, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It slams the lid down on single-country funds,'' said Michael
T. Porter, a country fund analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange-listed American depository receipts, another familiar
way for Americans to invest in Europe, should remain attractive.
Because they are priced in dollars, trade on American exchanges and
conform to American accounting rules, they are easy for Americans
to follow. (Unlisted ADRs trade over the counter and need not meet
American standards.)
</P>
<P>
   As always, an ADR's dollar value depends on movements in both
the price of the underlying European stock and the value of the
currency. Monetary union will eliminate the currency fluctuations
among member nations, but their shared currency, the euro, will
still rise and fall relative to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Only a minority of top European companies trade as ADRs,
however, and for some investors, the exposure they offer may not be
broad enough.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Bank of New York compiles an index of 107
exchange-listed ADRs for Euroland, but many of the top 10 stocks in
market capitalization for each country are missing. The bank is
designing a product that would allow American investors to buy the
ADR index, but there are no details yet.
</P>
<P>
   American investors love index funds, which simply buy all the
stocks in a widely followed index like the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
No Euroland analogue yet exists, and creating one will not be easy.
One obstacle will be distinguishing for Americans between Europe
and Euroland.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones Indexes, along with the French, German and Swiss stock
markets, has started a family of indexes for Europe and for
Euroland collectively called Stoxx.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Capital International introduced a 335-stock
index for Euroland on April 30. Standard &AMP; Poor's, The Financial
Times of London and Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. have a 351-stock Eurobloc
index, and The Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange have a
100-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   But these companies have been more successful in selling their
indexes to fund managers and institutional investors as benchmarks
for performance than in bringing index trading to American
investors. None has a retail product ready to see daylight, though
Dow Jones is promising one.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Crosby, director of global marketing at Morgan Stanley,
said, ``Marketing Europe from a U.S. perspective is not a big
revenue opportunity now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even the Vanguard Group, the index fund leader, has plans
for a Euroland fund. ``We take a long-term view of things,'' said
Brian S. Mattes, Vanguard's spokesman. ``It must be a durable
investment need, and it must go on for years.'' The company doesn't
think Euroland passes the test.
</P>
<P>
   Index investing by country can be done through the World Equity
Benchmark Shares, or Webs, traded on the American Stock Exchange;
they are based on Morgan Stanley country indexes. But no
pan-European or Euroland Webs are planned.
</P>
<P>
   While there is hardly a rush to offer Euroland plays directly to
American investors, plenty of analysts in the United States and
Europe are trying to anticipate Euroland's effects and to spot ways
to profit.

European equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in London.
</P>
<P>
   Euroland will also provoke major shifts in existing portfolios,
analysts argue. Money managers in specific European countries who
view Euroland as a single market will de-emphasize domestic stocks
and buy across borders. This shift, which seems to have begun, will
move prices of many issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Scott, the European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in
London, noted in a recent report that the weighting for German
stocks in a Euroland index would be around 27 percent, but by his
estimate, German institutions and money managers now have 70
percent of their assets in German equities.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this evidence, there is plenty of scope for German
institutions to diversify their portfolios,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts argue that smaller-company stocks will be hurt
most, as they are sold by money managers to make room for bigger
stocks from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Murali Ramaswami, global head of equities derivative research at
Lehman Brothers, said that while European stocks in general were
becoming more sensitive to industry factors than to country
factors, some companies and sectors would continue to be
country-sensitive. He found commercial banks in France, Germany,
Italy and Spain to be in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, he said, the most industry-sensitive stocks varied
from country to country: property and casualty insurance in France;
mining, metals and minerals in Germany, and automobiles and
utilities in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in cross-border mergers within Euroland will also
buoy some stocks, analysts predict, as consolidation picks up speed
in oil, construction and _ especially in Italy _ in financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers taking advantage of monetary union to travel and to
buy second homes may help some Euroland companies. On the other
hand, the simplification of cross-border comparison shopping may
hurt profits of airlines, retailers and brand-name goods makers
accustomed to tailoring their prices from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts point out that these factors do not add up to a
night-and-day difference between investment opportunities inside
and outside Euroland. American mutual fund managers seem to prefer
Europe to Euroland as a playing field in both stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree that the unified Euroland government bond market
will be larger and more liquid than the present array of national
markets. But many say it is not an attractive bet right now, while
potentially more enticing markets for corporate bonds and junk
bonds will take time to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Askew, executive vice president of Rowe Price-Fleming
International in London, said fixed-income investors would do best
in a broader European or international bond fund that can take
advantage of European opportunities outside Euroland.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are betting on Greece, which hopes to join the
union in the second round a few years from now. The required sharp
cuts in Greek interest rates would mean big capital gains for
bondholders, in the kind of ``convergence play'' that paid off
handsomely as Italy and others prepared for Euroland's birth.
</P>
<P>
   N. Graham Allen, the managing director for global fixed-income
at Wells Capital Management in Los Angeles, likes Britain, the
biggest European player not in Euroland, for the same reason; he
thinks Britain will decide to join before too long.
</P>
<P>
   Equity analysts also say it is difficult to ignore Britain. A
Euroland stock fund, Bratt of Scudder Kemper said, ``omits the
largest stock market in Europe, and that seems undesirable to me.''
He said his company's closed-end New Europe fund also includes
emerging markets like Poland and Hungary that he would be loath to
exclude by investing solely in Euroland.
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets are performing well across Europe, so for American
investors, the question of Euroland versus all of Europe may seem
academic. The important choice is whether to invest in Europe, by
any definition, or not. &QL;

GLENN EAGERLY AWAITS ASCENT FROM POLITICS

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John Glenn, the merriest commuter on Capitol
Hill, was talking of the spaceship he will soon be riding and the
joy of weightlessness _ which for him is rivaled by the delight of
never again having to engage in political fund raising, the bane of
his earthly existence these past 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather wrestle a gorilla than ask anybody for another 50
cents,'' the senator growled rather happily amid busy days of
commuting between space travel training in Houston and the
astronaut's requisite renunciation of the earthly baggage called
politics.
</P>
<P>
   When he rockets up in October for a nine-day ride at the age of
77, Glenn, who 36 years ago became the first American to orbit the
earth, will once more be a space pioneer, running a myriad of
geriatric medical experiments on himself as the oldest space
traveler ever.
</P>
<P>
   But as a retrofitted astronaut, once more wholesomely
nonpartisan, the Democrat from Ohio will also be ending his Senate
career in a bang and a rush that he tacitly acknowledges with a
sparkle-eyed smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not done here by a long shot,'' insisted the senator in
his Capitol office, tracking the debate on the tobacco bill, not
wanting to get ahead of himself as he flies his own plane to the
Houston space center on every available Capitol recess and long
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There, for the past five months, he has been practicing his role
in the mid-deck crew of the spaceship Discovery and bonding with
the other six members of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ''They call me John; I straightened that out when I first went
down,'' he said. ``I told them that at the other end of the line I
may be a senator, but down there I'm John, a working crew member.
They liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   As liftoff nears, Glenn tries to minimize the unscientific fun
of returning to space for a far longer ride than his historic
five-hour, three-orbit trip on Feb. 20, 1962, which galvanized the
nation's pride in the depths of the Cold War space race with the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   His nature is to regale Capitol acquaintances with the sheer
detail of his next mission, speaking of the voluminous engineering
tasks he obviously loves. He celebrates the pleasure of following a
firm schedule, as opposed to the free fall of Senate politics. As
he talks, the lack of pretension that marked his initial celebrity
remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the greatest bunch of guys you ever saw in your
life,'' Glenn said of his crewmates, his heartland twang ready to
resound once more from space.
</P>
<P>
   He openly worries that once he is beyond the pull of Senate and
launch pad, he may foul up some experiments as he labors with 21
different electronic leads attached to his scalp and chest _ a
weightless geezer injected with protein-tracking isotopes, running
the spacecraft centrifuge, juggling assorted deckhand tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I worry about is lousing things up and not
doing a good job up there,'' said the senator, whose duties,
already time-lined to the minute in his nine-day travel plan,
include gathering data on muscle, blood and bone chemistry and on
sleeplessness and other conditions of the aging process. He became
curious about these problems two years ago when he realized how
many of them are also experienced temporarily by young astronauts
in space.
</P>
<P>
   As fervidly as House Republicans used to carry the Contract With
America in their pockets, Glenn carries a terse checklist of 10
problems that he found in his own research to be common to the
basic medicine of space and geriatrics. He used this array of
problems, ranging from nutrition to equilibrium, in lobbying space
officials to rocket him back up to begin fresh research in behalf
of earthbound humanity, noting that the over-65 population will
triple in the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the luxury of going for a free ride, John Glenn
or anybody else,'' the senator insisted. ``I'm into this thing on a
science basis.''
</P>
<P>
   In his eighth decade of life, the senator has been power-walking
two miles a day for years and found no problem in passing the
physical for astronauts, who in the past have been ruled out by
around age 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a letter that says I have been through the most
rigorous physical of any astronaut that's ever been selected,'' he
proudly noted. ``The target heart rate for everybody is 220 minus
your age and, no problem, I did that,'' he added, smiling boyishly,
as if that target can only get mathematically easier the older he
gets.
</P>
<P>
   He talks soberly of how his staff will attend to constituent
needs once he goes aloft, his political career winding down without
him. But ask him about space flight and his hands, the confident
hands of a pilot, rise and shape the dynamics and his eyes gleam as
he offers detailed narrative on such emergency contingencies as
``the RTLS'' _ return to launch site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solids have come off,'' he said of the initial shedding of
rockets, plunging forth imaginatively from his Senate perch. ``And
you're up over the Atlantic accelerating rapidly toward Africa,
8,000 miles an hour, say. And something happens. And you have only
a three-and-a-half-minute chance to get back down.''
</P>
<P>
   Listeners can only grip the arms of their Capitol chairs as the
senator describes an ingenious reversal of the ship, her heated
plunge back toward Florida waters, the blowing of an escape hatch,
and the crew member called John bailing out with his mates at the
age of 77. ``We were practicing for this in the training pool the
other day,'' he noted, grinning. ``You hit the water just like a
fighter pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   Summoned back to earth by the Senate roll-call buzzer, John
Glenn talked of his political career as an adventure of a different
order, one where gravity can dictate the slogger's pace and
navigation is not often by the stars. ``I had a chance to do some
things I think were good,'' he said gently, noting such victories
as the enactment of his 1994 nuclear nonproliferation sanction law,
which is currently being directed at India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of it I'll miss,'' he said of politics. ``But I
never got my wildest enjoyment out of campaigning anyway, and
particularly fund raising. That's the most miserable part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   His hands idle atop his desk, the senator made it seem as if the
saddest part of leaving is his discovery that the right stuff in
politics has become great amounts of money. ``This is the most
stinking mess in government, the favored treatment from campaign
finance,'' he said, preparing to leave this place far behind,
although not without a certain smile at parting.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see an election coming up and not be raising money,'' he
exulted, as if already looking down from above. ``That's a joy.'' &QL;

GIULIANI'S $15.1 MILLION `EMERGENCY CONTROL CENTER' 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Map is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers

 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani proclaims he has
restored safety and civility to New York City streets, he has
quietly been bracing for all manner of human treachery and
cataclysms, building a $15.1 million emergency control center for
his administration _ bullet-proofed, hardened to withstand bombs
and hurricanes, and equipped with food and beds for at least 30
members of his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious project, which will sprawl over 46,000 feet in one
of the smaller buildings of the World Trade Center complex, will be
large enough to accommodate at least 50 different city, state and
federal agencies, and will allow them to coordinate responses to a
myriad of disasters, from the smallest sewer explosion to the
largest nerve gas attack.
</P>
<P>
   Among its amenities will be back-up generators in case of power
failures, a storage tank with enough water to last at least a week,
and whiz-bang technology that will include a secure ``red'' phone
for the mayor and video-conferencing, so he can see and talk to the
president of the United States, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the facility is a safety haven, ``not a bunker,''
Jerome Hauer, head of the city's Office of Emergency Management,
noted that New York City's emergency response system had become a
model for other cities and said that the planned center was a
natural next step in keeping that lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something the city has needed for a long time, a
state-of-the-art center with a sophisticated communications system,
that is survivable so the city can continue to function,'' he said.
``If there is a citywide blackout, a hurricane, a blizzard, this is
the facility that will allow us to keep working, to make sure that
people are not in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the news of the center's construction troubled many in city
government, especially City Council members, who were not notified
of the project. Some noted that the existing command center on the
eighth floor of police headquarters has functioned admirably during
a variety of storms, blackouts and terrorist attacks. Councilwoman
Kathryn Freed, whose district will house the new center, also
questioned whether the investment was fiscally prudent at a time
when the mayor has threatened to cut funding for senior citizens
centers, city hospitals and services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when the mayor is screaming and yelling about pork
in city government and trying to cut city services that keep
libraries and day care centers open, it seems bizarre to me that
the city would be putting nearly $16 million into a rented space
that the city doesn't even own,'' Ms. Freed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a $16 million improvement to another guy's building?''
she said. ``I sure hope this is a 99-year lease.''

U.S. ENDORSES TREATY ON CHILD LABOR ABUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Labor Secretary Alexis Herman gave the Clinton
administration's support this week to a proposed treaty to outlaw
the most exploitative forms of child labor.
</P>
<P>
   Herman said she hoped that a mechanism to be included in the
treaty calling for follow-up reporting of abuses would encourage
countries to abide by their pledges to end economic exploitation of
children.
</P>
<P>
   The new initiative, at the International Labor Organization,
comes 25 years after the body first tried to curb such abuses. But
nearly two-thirds of the ILO's 174 member nations, particularly
developing countries, chose not to sign it. The United States
itself did not sign.
</P>
<P>
   That convention barred children under 15 from working, except in
the poorest countries where the age was set at 13. And no child
under 18 could work in heavy industry.
</P>
<P>
   The new convention takes a more limited approach, focusing on
such extreme forms of child labor as working in mines and
prostitution. The proposal could be ready for nations to sign next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys indicate that about 250 million children between the
ages of 5 and 14 work worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Herman announced that the administration planned to ask Congress
for $30 million _ a large increase over the current $3 million
contribution _ for the ILO's project to help countries cope with
child-labor abuses. More than 20 countries have applied for help in
eliminating dangerous child labor. &QL;

CLINTON IMPOSES 10-YEAR BAN ON OFFSHORE DRILLING OF OCEANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEREY, Calif. _ Calling offshore oil drilling an
environmental risk, President Clinton signed a directive Friday
banning exploration off the East and West Coasts through 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced an extension on the current moratorium to a
standing ovation at the National Oceans Conference. Joined by Vice
President Al Gore and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, the
president outlined a series of steps to protect the beaches and
marine life.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, it is clear we must save these shores from oil
drilling. Here in California, you know all too well how oil spills
from offshore drilling can spoil our coasts, causing not just the
death of marine life, but the destruction of fragile ecosystems.
Even under the best of circumstances, is it really worth the
risk?,'' Clinton asked 300 scientists and experts.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also proposed a new user fee on shippers to
provide $800 million over five years to repair the nation's ports;
banned the catching or import of Atlantic swordfish weighing less
than 33 pounds; proposed $6 million through 2002 to restore 18
damaged coral reefs and proposed $12 million through 2002 to expand
and develop deep-sea observatories. He also called on the Senate to
ratify the Law of the Seas Convention that provides a legal
framework for activities in international waters.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year ban on offshore drilling applies to the entire West
Coast, most of New England and the Mid-Atlantic, southwest Florida
and the North Aleutian Basin in southern Alaska. The administration
placed a five-year moratorium on drilling on the outer continental
shelf in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Drilling would still be allowed in the Gulf of Mexico off the
coasts of Louisiana and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The president's directive also permanently bans drilling leases
within 12 existing marine sanctuaries off California, Florida,
Georgia and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``By standing firm against offshore oil drilling here in
California and around the nation, these people have helped to
protect the most beautiful shores anywhere in the world and we can
continue to do that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry, however, said the administration's ban would
only harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, the Washington-based trade
group that represents the major oil companies, called the decision
``unfortunate because it ignores the near-perfect performance of
the American petroleum industry in operating offshore in a safe and
environmentally sensitive manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. government statistics show that natural seeps from the
ocean floor introduce 100 times more crude oil into U.S. marine
waters than do the petroleum industry's offshore activities,'' API
said.
</P>
<P>
   But in California the issue of banning offshore drilling is
supported by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Pete Wilson even wrote a letter to Clinton
calling on the president to make the ban permanent. Clinton aides
said the governor, who was invited to the oceans conference but did
not attend, was grandstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Katie McGinty, Clinton`s top adviser on the environment, said
the president backed a 10-year extension because it was ``the most
prudent course here.'' She said the administration has maintained
``a very effective dialogue'' with the oil industry and the
administration has ``equaled or surpassed'' previous
administrations in the number of oil and gas leases granted.
</P>
<P>
   McGinty said the western Gulf of Mexico was not included in the
drilling ban because it is not as ecologically sensitive as the
other areas.
</P>
<P>
   While environmentalists cheered Clinton's action, they
criticized the president for failing to take further steps to stop
ocean pollution immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixed message,'' said Clifton Curtis, the ocean adviser
for the World Wildlife Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton convened the two-day National Oceans Conference, which
was opened by Gore on Thursday, as part of an international effort
to focus world attention on the problems faced by the Earth's last
frontier. The conference was hosted by the U.S. Navy and the
Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Earle, a scientist who holds the title of
explorer-in-residence at National Geographic, noted experts know
more about the moon's surface than the ocean's geography.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have neglected the oceans and it has cost us dearly,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the ocean waters are at their warmest in centuries,
thanks to greenhouse gas emissions that warm the water temperatures
and create the El Nino phenomenon that causes weather extremes
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He ran through a series of problems including pollution from the
land running into the seas, overfishing which has devastated
two-thirds of fish habitats, and conditions that could destroy 30
percent of the world's coral reefs within 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also charged his Cabinet with developing a long-range
oceans strategy with in a year and called on Congress to create an
oceans commission to help forge the new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to do this right, we're going to have to do it
together. We have to make this an American issue that transcends
party and other philosophical differences,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's address here began a three-day visit to the West
Coast. Clinton was to be the main speaker at fund raising events
for California Sen. Barbara Boxer in San Francisco and for Oregon
Rep. Darlene Hooley in Portland.

U.S. AND ALLIES RELUCTANT TO USE FORCE AGAINST SERBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO-DIPLO.) 
(ja) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and its allies remain reluctant
to use force against the Yugoslav army, despite NATO's decision
Thursday to put on a display of air power in countries bordering
the Serbian province of Kosovo, officials of the United States and
other NATO member-nations said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Western policy, as it is being formulated on the run, hinges
on the credible threat of force in order to prompt a negotiated
solution between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the
ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, who make up 90 percent of the Serb
province.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Clinton administration and NATO officials do not
expect quick Russian approval for a Security Council resolution
authorizing any use of force. The Serbs are traditional allies of
Moscow, and Kosovo is, after all, an internationally recognized
part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But these officials say they are counting on President Boris
Yeltsin to help convince Milosevic, when they meet on Tuesday, to
halt the violence against ethnic Albanians and to start negotiating
seriously with their representatives.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic ends up embarrassing the Russians by rebuffing
Moscow's requests, senior American and NATO-country officials say,
Moscow may be more willing to support a decision to authorize NATO
to use force in or over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by Britain, the allies have done much this week to make
the threat of force a credible one. NATO has agreed to displays of
air power in countries like Albania and Macedonia, and to
accelerated planning for a possible use of force in Kosovo, against
a backdrop of tough talk Friday when Western foreign ministers met
in London.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are hopeful that the threat of force will be
sufficient to deter Milosevic from continuing his military
operations in Kosovo, where about 250 people have been killed,
about 10,000 have become refugees and 60,000 or more have been
displaced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic argues that he is using his forces to put down an
insurrection by the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for
independence _ much as Moscow tried to put down insurrectionists in
Chechnya without NATO's interference.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials emphasize that force, no matter who wields it,
will not bring a solution to the Kosovo problem. Only negotiations
can do that, they say. And there is a growing consensus that
Washington and NATO must press both the Serbs and ethnic Albanians
to negotiate _ and to negotiate for an end neither side currently
accepts.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Albanian leader Washington favors, Ibrahim Rugova,
who favors negotiations for independence, is rapidly losing popular
support to the Kosovo Liberation Army, Western intelligence
officials say, and few ethnic Albanians favor talks with the Serbs.
That suggests that if negotiations with Milosevic are to work, a
representative of the KLA must be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem right now is that you're negotiating with someone,
Rugova, who can't deliver the people who have to be delivered to to
make a settlement stick,'' a senior Western official said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the official conceded, little is known about
the leadership and structure of the KLA. ``We need to do a lot more
work to figure out who and how'' the KLA is represented in any
negotiations, he said, given that Milosevic may be unwilling to
meet directly with a KLA representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a political process going to which both sides
are genuinely committed, and right now we don't have that,'' the
official said. Nor is the West acting with a firm agreement on what
the outcome should be.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and its allies favor enhanced autonomy for Kosovo
within a federal Yugoslavia. But the ethnic Albanians, regardless
of whether they favor the approach chosen by Rugova or the KLA,
want independence and say a return to the status quo is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who took away Kosovo's autonomous status within
Serbia in 1989, shows little sign of willingness to grant Kosovo
much more than a return to the way things were.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials acknowledge that any settlement must contain
protections for Kosovo's Serbs and for the Serbian monasteries,
cultural centers and historical sites that are central to the
Serbs' self-image and ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials compare Kosovo to Northern Ireland, in the sense
that an armed group is fighting for independence and that peace
requires that it accept more realistic goals short of that
aspiration. But Kosovo and the KLA seem to lack a figure like Gerry
Adams, the head of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, who can articulate a set of compromises to the men
with the guns.
</P>
<P>
   With divisions about how deep to get involved in Kosovo,
Washington has been willing to be driven by the British and Germans
toward a more confrontational policy toward Milosevic, including
the imposition of economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, American officials say they and NATO have been deeply
involved with Kosovo policy in the first three months of this
crisis, a marked contrast to Bosnia, where Washington kept its
distance for nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official said, ``at least we have the start of a
policy.'' Serious negotiations can begin with stabilizing security
in Kosovo and ending the violence, he added. ``Then we can talk
about political and constitutional arrangements. But there's going
to be no quick fix in Kosovo.''

GOP SENATORS DELAY HISPANIC JUDGE'S ELEVATION TO APPEALS COURT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Judge Sonia Sotomayor seemed like a trouble-free
choice when President Clinton first nominated her to an appeals
court post a year ago. Hers was an appealing story: a child from
the Bronx housing projects who went on to graduate summa cum laude
from Princeton and become editor of the Yale Law Journal and then a
federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she had been a trial judge since 1992 when she was
named to the bench by George Bush, the last Republican president.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican senators have been blocking Judge Sotomayor's
elevation to the appeals court for a highly unusual reason; to make
her less likely to be picked by Clinton for the Supreme Court,
senior Republican congressional aides said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The delay of a confirmation vote on Judge Sotomayor to the 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New York, is an example of
the intense and often byzantine politics that take place unseen in
many judicial nominations. Several elements of the Sotomayor case
are odd, White House officials and Democrats in Congress say, but
the chief one is the fact that there is no current vacancy on the
Supreme Court, and no firm indication that there will be one soon.
Nor is there any evidence of a campaign to put Judge Sotomayor
under consideration for a seat if there were a vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Sotomayor's nomination was approved overwhelmingly by the
Senate Judiciary Committee in March, making her one of the judicial
nominees who have cleared the committee and waited the longest for
a final vote on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Republican staff aides in the Senate said that Trent Lott
of Mississippi, the Senate majority leader, has agreed to hold up a
vote on Judge Sotomayor's nomination as part of an elaborate and
complex political calculus; if she were easily confirmed to the
appeals court, they said, that would put her in a position to be
named by President Clinton to the Supreme Court. And Senate
Republicans think that they would then have a difficult time
opposing a Hispanic woman who had just been confirmed by the full
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we think that putting her on the appeals court puts
her in the batter's box to be nominated to the Supreme Court,''
said one senior Republican staff aide who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``If Clinton nominated her it would put several of our
senators in a real difficult position.'' Lott declined through a
spokeswoman to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said some senators believed that Judge Sotomayor's
record on the bench could fit the profile of an ``activist judge'',
a description that has been used by conservatives to question a
jurist's ability to construe the law strictly. It is a description
that Judge Sotomayor's supporters, including some conservative New
York lawyers, hotly dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont who is the senior Democrat on the
Judiciary Committee was blunt in his criticism of the Republicans
who are blocking a confirmation vote: ``Their reasons are stupid at
best and cowardly at worst,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are saying is that they have a brilliant judge who
also happens to be a woman and Hispanic and they haven't the guts
to stand up and argue publicly against her on the floor,'' Leahy
said. ``They just want to hide in their cloakrooms and do her in
quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   The models for putting a candidate on an appeals court to
enhance his or her stature as a Supreme Court nominee are Judge
Robert Bork and Judge Clarence Thomas both of whom were placed on
the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in part to
be poised to be nominated to the Supreme Court. Bork was denied
confirmation to the Supreme Court in 1987 and Thomas was confirmed
in 1991, both after bruising political battles.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation for the Republicans' strategy is based on two
highly speculative aspects: that President Clinton is eager to name
the first Hispanic to the Supreme Court and that he will have such
an opportunity as one of the current justices, perhaps John Paul
Stevens, will retire at the end of the current Supreme Court term
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings about the possibility of Judge Sotomayor filling
Stevens' seat was raised by the Wall Street Journal editorial pages
this month, both in an editorial and in an op-ed column by Paul
Gigot who often reflects conservative thinking in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Although justices often announce their retirements at the end of
a term Justice Stevens has not given a clue he will do so. He has,
in fact, hired law clerks for next year's term. The Journal's
commentary criticized Judge Sotomayor's record, particularly a 1997
case in which she ruled that a New York business coalition, the
Grand Central Partnership, trying to give work experience to the
homeless had violated federal law by not paying the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Walpin, a former federal prosecutor who is widely known
in New York legal circles as a staunch conservative, disagreed
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had read the case they would see that she said she
personally approved of the homeless program but that as a judge she
was required to apply the law as it exists,'' he said. ``She wrote
that the law does not permit an exception in this case. That's
exactly what conservatives want: a non-activist judge who does not
apply her own views but is bound by the law.''
</P>
<P>
   It also remains unclear who first believed that Judge Sotomayor
was a hidden Clinton candidate for the Supreme Court. Hispanic bar
groups have pressed the Clinton administration to name the first
Hispanic justice but White House officials said they are not
committed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic National Bar Association has submitted a list of
six candidates to the White House as possible Supreme Court
nominees. But Martin Castro, a Chicago lawyer and official of the
group, said Judge Sotomayor's name is not on the list.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of her confirmation hearing, Sept. 30. 1997, Rush
Limbaugh, the conservative radio talk-show host, warned the Senate
that Judge Sotomayor was an ultraliberal who was on a ``rocket
ship'' to the Supreme Court. That day, Judge Sotomayor was
questioned closely by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the only Republicans to vote against her were Sen.
John Kyl of Arizona and Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri. The
committee's other conservative members voted in her favor. Both Kyl
and Ashcroft declined comment on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The delay on Judge Sotomayor comes as Ralph Winter, the chief
judge of the 2d Circuit, has complained of terrible delays because
of unfilled vacancies. In his annual report, Winter, a conservative
Republican, lamented that he had to declare judicial emergencies on
several occasions to allow retired judges and trial judges to sit
on appeals panels to deal with the court's largest backlog in
history.

 CUP-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN P. LOPEZ  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MARSEILLE, France _ One team was just happy to be here. The other
was at home and on stage in the biggest soccer event to pass its
way in nearly 60 years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guess which team dominated?
</P>
<P>
   The French, who considered it an outrage that it had been more
than a decade since it last competed in the World Cup finals but an
honor to be hosting the 1998 tournament, thrilled the wild home
masses Friday night with an all-around thrashing of overmatched
South Africa. The score was 3-0, and it wasn't that close.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of game of which French dreams were made.
</P>
<P>
   No contest. A thrashing. French toast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could have put another one into the net in the first
half, so we would be comfortable all night,'' France coach Aime
Jacquet said. ``But I was happy with the way we kept the ball on
their end. We stayed in control.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a captivating display of ball possession by the French,
who controlled nearly 60 minutes of the clock and threw in just
enough thrilling plays to keep the chilly, wind-blown Marseille
crowd roaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there is pressure playing at home, but this is what we
have been waiting for for years,'' said Jacquet, who saw the French
team miss World Cup qualification in 1990 and 1994. ``We wanted to
be in this game, and I think we took advantage of the
opportunities. We played a great game. But it was one game, and
there is a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the winning goal came on a terrific header by
striker Christophe Dugarry, who definitely took advantage of an
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Normally a starter for France, Dugarry was relegated to the
bench for the opener. He came on in the 27th minute after starting
forward Stephane Guivarc'h hurt his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after taking the field, Dugarry fired a
rocket that barely missed. Moments later, he would trigger one of
the more productive nights of his career with the sharp goal midway
through the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Dugarry took four shots and was involved in the
second goal, laying off a ball for Youri Djorkaeff, who hit a
falling, slow roller at South Africa goalkeeper Hans Vonk from
inside the penalty area. Vonk appeared to have the shot covered,
but a sliding attempt to clear the ball by defender Pierre Issa
caused it to bounce over Vonk and land softly in the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it would be a fabulous challenge playing in front of
our nation, but it was an unforgettable night,'' Djorkaeff said.
``We have a lot of bullets in the gun, and we have not unloaded
them all. We're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``Bafana Bafana'' _ the Boys, as the South
Africans are called _ could only keep trying to get their feet
under them in South Africa's first World Cup appearance. During
apartheid, the South Africans never were invited.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, they hardly got the ball out of their end, firing
a mere six shots, none of which could have been considered a
realistic scoring opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much excitement in the air, a wonderful
atmosphere for us, I'm sure it was difficult for South Africa,''
said Thierry Henry, who scored France's final goal on a chip-in
during injury time. ``It was a victory, and we could not ask for
more than victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we will keep playing like this and the crowd will
keep cheering. We have to applaud the French people as much as they
applauded us.''

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The space shuttle completed its final
mission to the Russian space station Friday, bringing Mir's seventh
and last American tenant home from his stay of 4 and a half months
in Earth orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank you all for bringing me home and giving me a
great ride,'' the long-duration astronaut, Andrew Thomas, said
minutes after a bumpy but safe landing aboard the shuttle
Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown, at the Kennedy Space Center here at 2 p.m.,
capped a 10-day, 3.8-million-mile flight that included four days in
which Discovery was docked at Mir to deliver supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a 46-year-old mechanical engineer enduring his first
sensations of gravity in 141 days, needed help getting out of the
shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to that first meal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lasagna and Oreo cookie ice cream awaited him at Kennedy's
astronaut crew quarters, where he was taken for detailed medical
tests. But doctors said he might be too woozy to stomach the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' homecoming brought to a close a series of 10 shuttle
encounters with Mir: one fly-around to perfect rendezvous
techniques and nine subsequent dockings, which together made up the
first phase of NASA's cooperative effort with Russia and 15 other
countries to build a $40 billion space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the end, it's just the beginning of a new phase,''
said NASA administrator Daniel Goldin in a runway ceremony Friday.
That new phase begins in November, when the first piece of the
space station is to be lofted into orbit by a Russian rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke from numerous Central Florida wildfires wafted in the
shuttle's path during its computer-guided descent, but the haze
posed no visibility problems for the flight commander, Charles
Precourt, an Air Force colonel, who was at Discovery's controls for
the final approach.
</P>
<P>
   The winged ship announced its presence with a double sonic boom
and swooped out of a cloud-dotted sky to touch down and bounce once
on the three-mile-long Shuttle Landing Facility. Moderate
crosswinds picked the 100-ton spacecraft up briefly and set it back
down with no harm done.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas made the trip home with feet up and head down in a
reclining chair to alleviate his risk of fainting as body fluids,
which had floated in his head and chest in space, were inclined to
rush into his lower torso and legs under the influence of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said he would fight nausea for several days and face
months of aches and pains as his weakened bones and muscles grew
used to being on Earth again.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour after Discovery touched down, Thomas was taken
into a rolling emergency room of sorts that pulled up to the
shuttle's hatch. After a quick checkup, he was transported to the
astronaut crew quarters for a brief reunion with friends, a hot
shower and several hours of detailed medical exams.
</P>
<P>
   He was to spend the night at Kennedy with a doctor at his
bedside, then go home to Houston with his crewmates on Saturday.
Tom Marshburn, a NASA flight surgeon at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston, said Thomas would spend up to six hours a day with doctors
and physical therapists in the early stages of a formal six-week
rehabilitation period. &QL;

VOLKSWAGEN FACES SUIT OVER JEWISH SLAVE LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ A week after it bought Rolls-Royce, and just as
it adds Lamborghini sports cars to its automotive stable,
Volkswagen is facing a lawsuit seeking payment of wages to Jewish
slave laborers forced to work for the company during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus von Muenchhausen, a lecturer at Bremen University, said
Friday that he was suing Volkswagen on behalf of 30 Hungarian-born
Jews, all living in Israel, who were chosen for slave labor _
rather than the gas chamber _ at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The legal action was a blunt reminder of Volkswagen's roots not
only as Hitler's favored car company _ the idea of a Volkswagen,
or, ``people's car,'' was a prewar pet project _ but also as a key
player in the Nazi armaments industry, building war materiel
ranging from jeeps to rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs worked at Volkswagen plants in Lower Saxony
between 1944 and 1945, and, based on what a German worker would
have earned at the time, von Muenchhausen said they were owed
around $28,000 each. Two years ago, Volkswagen published a history
of its wartime operations in which it acknowledged using slave
labor. But the company has refused to pay out individual claims for
wages, saying it is impossible to quantify the appropriate amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen officials dealing with the issue did not return a
reporter's calls Friday to verify reports that the company was
prepared to make some kind of payments to the European countries
from which many slave laborers came.

<P>
   LAUCA ENE, Bolivia _ Like congressmen all over the world, Evo
Morales hugs babies and makes fist-thumping speeches. But that's
where the similarities end. For starters, this congressman chews
coca leaves in public.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Morales returned to his district recently, he was
not at all embarrassed to be photographed caressing the coca bushes
that grow on his property. During his election campaign last year,
he ran on the slogan ``Vote for coca!'' He won 70 percent of the
vote in a field of 10, which is perhaps not particularly surprising
since his district, the tropical region of Chapare, produces 85
percent of the refined cocaine produced in Bolivia every year.
</P>
<P>
   At age 38, Morales is the spokesman for six of the seven coca
grower unions in Bolivia, and he is the single most powerful
politician standing in the way of efforts by the United Nations and
the U.S. and Bolivian governments to fight the Bolivian cocaine
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Hugo Banzer Suarez announced in January his
intention to eradicate the coca industry in Chapare by the year
2002, Morales has been leading road blockades and accusing the
president and his family of being international traffickers
themselves _ charges that he has failed to substantiate but that
have won him screaming newspaper headlines and considerable
national television exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see who wins in 2002,'' Morales said, while discussing
future protest strategy with the deputy mayor of the town of Villa
Catorce over an ample helping of stewed chicken and rice. ``If in
2002 there is no coca in Chapare, Banzer wins. If our people are
still growing coca, I win.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocky is a good word to describe the Bolivian legislator. He
applauded and laughed when his colleagues made speeches against him
in the halls of Congress recently, and he exchanged hearty
greetings with policemen who man road blocks in his district. When
he plays soccer, he likes to wear the number 10, the number worn by
Diego Armando Maradona, the great Argentine star. Still single, he
was quoted in a 1995 Bolivian newspaper interview that one day he
wanted to be married in a church made of coca leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an egotist, but when he enters the room he demands
attention,'' said Oscar Torrico Alvarado, a center-left congressman
from neighboring Cochabamba.
</P>
<P>
   Morales is controversial, to say the least, although a Dutch
human rights group nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1995
for protecting the rights of peasants who say they are doing
nothing more than growing a crop that has been grown in the Andean
region for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   After Morales openly called on coca growers to defend their
lands against army and police units, the government blamed him
personally for the killing of three police officers and the
wounding of 15 others in a string of ambushes staged since April.
He has also been blamed for a rash of threats members of his
organization have made to coca growers who have signed agreements
with the government to stop growing their illegal crops, a charge
that he only partly disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any threats have been spontaneous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government party is trying to strip him of the legal
immunity from prosecution that he is granted automatically by being
a federal legislator. But a majority in the Chamber of Deputies
opposed the move to sanction him in large part because it would set
a precedent that could someday backfire on a sizable number of
congressmen with questionable ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bolivian law enforcement agencies are trying to find
out if he has any ties with international drug traffickers, but
U.S. and Bolivian officials concede that they have come up nothing
solid so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very capable union leader and he knows how to inspire
and prepare young people,'' said Brig. Gen. Walter Cespedes
Ramallo, the top Bolivian army commander in Chapare. ``But he has
to know that to support coca cultivation in Chapare he is defending
the interests of the narcotraffickers.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with Morales through his district is an object lesson
on how coca permeates the politics and economics of the area that
votes for him so resoundingly. Touring his district in sandals and
blue jeans, he got out of his van to talk to a woman drying coca
leaves on her front yard in the town of Villa Catorce as she
complained about the increasing number of peasant associations in
the region who were abandoning the crop for fear of government
reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our problems,'' he said, nodding his head glumly.
But then, shaking off his own concerns that the unity of the coca
growers may be cracking under government pressure, he added,
``These are not really unions _ they have no members.''
</P>
<P>
   The main event of the day was a coca growers union meeting in
this sweltering town of wooden shacks set on stilts. As he arrived,
the growers were listening to radio reports of an ambush of a
government eradication team that left one policeman dead and three
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we lose any people?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting a young woman flanked by her children began
crying uncontrollably about the loss of income her family would
suffer if the government campaign was effective.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting behind a pile of coca leaves, Morales responded, ``It's
time to stop crying and start organizing!''
</P>
<P>
   Then he went into a blistering attack on the government. ``They
speak of sedition and treat us like guerrillas,'' he said. ``Banzer
is using Chapare to distract the rest of the country from all the
other problems the nation faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the attempts by his opponents in Congress to strip
him of his immunity, he steamed, ``Congress is the first mafia of
the state. All they know how to do is lie and steal.''
</P>
<P>
   The 300 union members cheered, and many took copious notes to
take back to their locals.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the people of Chapare, Morales originally came from
the highlands to find a more prosperous life. He came from a poor
subsistence farm family, worked in bakery and took up the trumpet
as an adolescent, and even became a professional for awhile. His
band specialized in playing the tinku and diabladas, traditional
Indian fight and protest music.
</P>
<P>
   He never finished high school, and then entered the army. His
life-defining epiphany, he said, came in 1978, when he took part in
a military action against a march by coca growers protesting a
military coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When ordered to shoot, I shot over the heads of the
protesters,'' he recalled. ``I saw that the biggest defenders of
democracy were the cocaleros.'' &QL;

NEW TRIAL ORDERED IN FELLS ACRE CHILD ABUSE CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY   AND JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ A Superior Court judge voided the child
sexual abuse conviction of Cheryl Amirault LeFave yesterday, saying
her alleged victims were manipulated by ``overzealous''
investigators who succumbed to a ``climate of panic, if not
hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   The scathing, 140-page decision, by Middlesex Superior Court
Judge Isaac Borenstein, also barred the alleged victims, now in
their teens, from testifying in any future retrial of LeFave _
effectively gutting the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein wrote that the alleged victims' accounts in the
14-year-old case were tainted by suggestive interviewing
techniques. The judge said the children were coerced by
interviewers who ``would not take `no' for an answer ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there is no independent evidence to corroborate these
allegations of abuse, their testimony is unreliable; its admission
at trial was a violation of the most fundamental rules of evidence
and due process.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Lynn Rooney immediately appealed the
ruling. She called Borenstein's opinion ``outrageous'' and deemed
it a ``final insult to the children and their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney said Borenstein usurped the authority of the trial judge,
the jury and the appellate court, and decided on his own that the
children were not telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is simply not appropriate,'' she said. ``He disbelieved
the parents.''
</P>
<P>
   When Borenstein announced his ruling, LeFave broke into a broad
smile and was congratulated by her lawyers. She was embraced by
supporters in the gallery as she left the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave said she was ``gratified'' by the decision, but ``very
fearful'' the Supreme Judicial Court could rule against her. LeFave
has lost several other appeals since she was convicted in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   She also was mindful of her brother, Gerald Amirault. Convicted
of similar charges, he is serving 30 to 40 years in prison, but
could benefit from Borenstein's ruling. The same child witnesses
who Borenstein said were tainted also testified against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over yet,'' LeFave said. &UR;  &LR; ``My brother is still
languishing in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the mothers of two children who testified against
Gerald Amirault were incensed. Both women asked that their names be
withheld to protect the identities of their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you think the kids feel? They are being called liars,''
said one woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened,'' said the other. ``The victims are the ones who
have to live with this for the rest of their lives, knowing that
these people are going to be left off free because the law didn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense of Judge Borenstein is that he is a smart judge,''
said Laurence Hardoon, who prosecuted all three defendants in three
trials. ``But it seems to me he has crossed the line between being
a judge and being an advocate in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Borenstein had ordered a new trial for LeFave on
different grounds, involving ineffective assistance of counsel. A
ruling on that issue is pending before the SJC.
</P>
<P>
   Both issues probably will be argued before the SJC in the fall,
but yesterday's ruling is considered much more significant.
Prosecutors said they will not be able to retry the case without
the child witnesses.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The Fells Acres case has raised questions about whether
testimony by preschool children is reliable. Convictions in many of
those cases have been overturned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, LeFave and her mother, the late Violet Amirault, were
granted a new trial because their rights to confront their accusers
may have been violated. Though they were released, the new trial
has never been held, and Violet Amirault, 74, died of cancer in
September.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Yesterday, at the request of defense lawyer James Sultan,
Borenstein formally dismissed the charges against Violet Amirault.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing four months ago, defense lawyers argued that LeFave
deserves a retrial because of new evidence: recent psychological
studies which indicate that preschool children can make up and
believe stories suggested to them through questioning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Maggie Bruck, a psychologist from McGill University in
Montreal, testified that there were no spontaneous disclosures by
children in the case. The allegations, she said, came only after
repeated, suggestive questioning from parents and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein agreed. In the case against Cheryl LeFave, he wrote,
physicial evidence of abuse was at best inconclusive, and almost
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of one child, the minimal amount of such
evidence only surfaced months after the children were improperly
questioned, the judge said. He also noted that the child's symptoms
were evident before she enrolled at Fells Acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``These alleged symptoms were only discussed after the families
were overwhelmed by the panic, hysteria, and media attention,''
Borenstein wrote. From the outset, he wrote, investigators were out
to get the Amiraults, and ignored the children's ``incredible''
claims of talking robots, the torture of animals in public, and
children being tied naked to a tree in front of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein noted that the child witnesses at first withstood the
interrogations and denied any abuse. ``Eventually,'' he said,
``they were broken down.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that Susan Kelley, a pediatric nurse who
interviewed all four child witnesses against LeFave, and police
also turned a deaf ear to other teachers and students who supported
the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein said the case has resulted in two tragedies: that
LeFave was wrongly convicted and ``no one will ever know for
certain if these children were sexually abused.''
</P>
<P>
   In a May ruling, Borenstein granted LeFave a new trial on the
grounds that her former lawyers were negligent. He said the lawyers
failed to object to the seating arrangement for the child witnesses
at the trial. The children were seated at an angle so they did not
face the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Before ruling on that motion, the SJC asked Borenstein to hear
the defense claim that the children's testimony was tainted.
</P>
<P>
   But the mothers of two of the victims stand by their children's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Both women said they believed the Amiraults were winning a
public relations battle, one that depicts the trials as ``witch
hunts'' and ignores the medical evidence, the children's sexually
provocative behavior and the common sense of jurors who convicted
LeFave, her mother, and brother more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you picture telling your child to say sexually explicit
things?'' said one woman. ``All these parents told their children
to say these things? At that age, they don't know anything about
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it didn't happen, but it did.''

COMMENTARY: BOYS INTO MEN AS DEATH HITS CLASS OF 1998 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Above the bronze entrance doors of a gracefully
curved Art Deco building on the Grand Concourse are the words
``Cardinal Hayes Memorial High School for Boys.'' They are a
reminder that although the students graduate as Hayesmen, a group
as proud and persistent as the Marines, they enter as children.
</P>
<P>
   Since the school opened in 1941 as the flagship of the Catholic
Archdiocese of New York, that transformation has happened through
all the usual rites of passage understood best by teen-age boys.
Football rallies each November at which heart-pounding,
raspy-voiced vengeance was vowed on its archrival, Mount Saint
Michael Academy. Penance by the hour in ``jug,'' where students
stood through detention. Countless teams and clubs, like the school
paper The Challenger (where this byline first appeared).
</P>
<P>
   Like the priests used to say, to enter this place is to join a
family that includes Martin Scorsese, Regis Philbin and enough
priests and police officers to bless and protect a small city. At
Hayes, kids began to feel they finally belonged to something larger
than the few blocks in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The adolescent rituals of past years were nothing compared to
the way the class of 1998 came of age. In the final weeks before
graduation, Hector Camilo and Aaron Jason Fenton, two funny and
popular seniors, died weeks apart. Hector died in March when his
car struck a tree on the West Side Highway. Aaron was killed six
weeks later, shot in the head while trying to settle an argument in
his neighborhood. Their classmates, fearful of the future,
ultimately became men through mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who didn't even like each other were giving each other
love, showing each other love,'' said Joseph Dickenson, a senior
who was close to Aaron. ``That shows how people grew. You had
respect to show your concern. Hector and Jason. You can't believe
it. I still can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   People who study these things for a living churn out reports
that show how schools like Hayes provide a community and common
purpose for young people whose homes and neighborhoods have
neither. Monsignor John Graham, the school's principal, said the
best way the students were able to weather the successive deaths
was by making real the lessons taught in religion classes, lessons
of forgiveness and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking anymore about how to play an instrument,'' he
said. ``Here's the instrument, play it. Here's this terrible
experience, we've got to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Aaron's murder, the school provided crisis counseling and
called off classes. Most students came in anyway. They didn't want
to be alone, because you think odd thoughts in the solitude of your
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like school meant nothing anymore,'' said Joseph Rosa,
who was driving behind Hector's car the night of the accident. ``It
was pointless. The goal was always to finish off together. As one.
It was supposed to be our best year.''
</P>
<P>
   What it became was their best moment, coming together in a way
that made them the talk of other schools. They set out yearbooks
for the two boys in the marble-walled lobby, where friends wrote
messages to them and their families. They filled up two boxes with
everything from mortarboards and senior caps to pictures from
outings and private notes. It all allowed them to bond like
brothers, to laugh and cry without shame. Rather than give up in
the face of random death, they rededicated themselves to each other
and their school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I do is in honor of them,'' said Luis Mangual.
``Anything of meaning to me is for them.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a gentleness you feel in the hallways, a tenderness
that dispels any idea of tough teachers and boastful boys. It was
felt last weekend, when the class of 1998 marched into St.
Patrick's Cathedral for graduation. Hector and Aaron had their
names called out with the rest of their class, and their parents
walked up the aisle to receive their diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a shiver go up my spine when I heard their names,''
said Leonardo Blackman, who was close to both boys. ``I felt like
they were inside of me. It felt good. It felt sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo came to Hayes from a public school, where he hit the
basketball courts more often than the books. Like most of his
classmates, he now plans to go to college. He's scared, but not
about the academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always tried to help each other,'' he said. ``That's my
fear about going to college. I'll miss these guys. They're my
brothers.''

 Advanced Tissue Falls After FDA Rejection   By Carl T. Hall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Advanced Tissue Sciences Inc. lost nearly half its stock value
yesterday after the FDA rejected the company's application to
market artificial skin.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Diego-based company's stock closed at $3.94, down $3.13
for a 44 percent decline. The plunge was triggered when Advanced
Tissue revealed that the Food and Drug Administration would not
approve ``Dermagraft,'' a bioengineered skin-replacement product,
without a new clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   That could take at least a year and perhaps as long as two
years. Arthur Benvenuto, chairman and chief executive, said the
company and its collaborator, Smith &AMP; Nephew, are discussing with
the FDA issues concerning the scope of the new trial.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA rejection runs counter to the recommendations of its own
expert advisory panel, which in January voted 7 to 2 in favor of
Advanced Tissue's application to sell Dermagraft for treating
diabetic foot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked away from the panel meeting thinking we were moving
along on the right path toward approval,'' Benvenuto said.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection left a clear field for another manufacturer,
Organogenesis Inc., whose skin-replacement product, Apligraf, won
FDA approval last month for patching hard-to-treat leg ulcers and
is being studied for diabetic complications. Its shares gained
$2.13 yesterday, or 9.2 percent, to close at $25.13.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions of the FDA have softened dramatically in recent
months after Congress forced the agency to streamline the
new-product review process.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's developments showed that the agency still can pack a
wallop even if evidence backing up a new product seems marginal.
Nor was anyone surprised by Advanced Tissue's setback.
</P>
<P>
   The company issued warnings in March that the FDA was raising
concerns about the Dermagraft application. Outright rejection
wasn't forewarned, but some analysts have been leery of the stock
for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been negative on it,'' noted Alan Jacobs at Avalon
Research Group in Boca Raton, Fla., adding that the stock ``could
go lower than this'' if the upcoming clinical trial stretches out
much more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Benvenuto said he has a ``solid financing strategy,'' including
a $50 million line of credit and money due from Smith &AMP; Nephew, to
see past the crisis and prove that the product meets FDA standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, we are going forward,'' he said.

BELIEFS: CHRISTIANS DEBATE PAUL'S TEXT ON WIFELY SUBMISSION
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By PETER STEINFELS    
 By c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Criticism was quick in coming after the Southern Baptist
Convention, at its annual meeting in Salt Lake City this week,
added to the denomination's basic statement of beliefs a
declaration that ``a wife is to submit herself graciously to the
servant leadership of her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Lois Powell of the liberal United Church of Christ, for
example, called the declaration ``a reaction and an affront to the
social movement for women's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist leaders would surely reply that the statement
also exhorts husbands to love their wives ``as Christ loved the
church'' and ``to provide for, to protect and to lead'' their
families. The declaration also states that ``husband and wife are
of equal worth before God.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the denomination's leaders maintain, the notion of
differing roles in marriage and the family is firmly rooted in the
Bible. Admonitions that wives ``submit'' or, in recent
translations, ``be subject'' to their husbands are found in several
passages of the New Testament, most eloquently in the fifth chapter
of the Letter to the Ephesians, which develops the analogy between
Christ as head of the church and the husband as ``head of the
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, most Christians embraced those passages in much
the same way as the Southern Baptists now do. But that is hardly
the case today. Ms. Powell, executive director of the United Church
of Christ's Coordinating Center for Women in Church and Society,
said ``very few'' of her church's members, who number more than 1
million, ``would utilize those passages as the guide for modern
relationships.'' She described the passage in Ephesians as ``a
statement of the early church, not of Jesus,'' and one that had
been written and then later interpreted ``in situations of sexism
and patriarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   If that view, from one of the nation's most consistently liberal
denominations, could have been expected, perhaps more striking were
the reactions of two professors at Fuller Theological Seminary in
Pasadena, Calif., an evangelical institution that emphasizes the
authority of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   David Scholer, a professor of New Testament at Fuller, called
the Southern Baptist declaration one more instance of ``selective
literalism.'' Most Christians claiming to be literal readers of the
Bible, he said, are in fact swayed by their tradition when it comes
to choosing what is significant. Southern Baptists do not take
literally Jesus' command that His followers wash one another's
feet, he noted, although some other Baptists do.
</P>
<P>
   Scholer also said the crucial passage in Ephesians was
introduced by the general instruction that Christians ``be subject
to one another,'' thus making mutual submission more fundamental
than any differentiating of responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Gundry-Volf, who also teaches New Testament at Fuller,
explained that New Testament passages like the one in Ephesians
were Christian adaptations of the ``household codes'' that
Greco-Roman moralists had developed to instruct the heads of
families in running their affairs. She suggested that these adapted
codes _ which also addressed the relations between parents and
children, slaves and masters, people and government _ could be seen
as a retreat from an earlier, more egalitarian ethos among Jesus'
followers. Paul had earlier declared that ``there is no longer male
and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus'' (Galatians
3:28), and had also referred to female leaders in the early church.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant view, Ms. Gundry-Volf said, is that this retreat
was a response to suspicions that Christians were upsetting a
social order based on patriarchal authority. But the Christian
household codes were not simply an accommodation to the patriarchal
system, she added; they rejected many of its abuses, filtering the
society's understanding of the relations between superiors and
inferiors through the Christian ethic of love. Many scholars call
the result a kind of ``love patriarchalism,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And where these Christian household codes were meant ``to ensure
that Christians could live out their faith in ways that did not
raise suspicions that they would disrupt the social order,'' the
Southern Baptist position does the opposite, she said: ``It is seen
to be antiquarian and disruptive of Western egalitarian values.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, an even more emphatic challenge to the kind of
interpretation favored by the Southern Baptists came 10 years ago
from Pope John Paul II. In ``Mulieris Dignitatem'' (``On the
Dignity of Women''), a papal letter generally viewed as
conservative, the pope argued that absolutely nothing in Ephesians
about wives' being subject to husbands could be understood apart
from the demand, introducing the whole passage, for ``mutual
subjection out of reverence for Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   The special subjection of wives, the pope said, is the ``old''
reality that the biblical author recognized as ``profoundly rooted
in the customs and religious tradition of the time.'' By contrast,
the call to mutual subjection is the ``something new,'' an
``innovation of the Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   Implicitly recognizing that the same New Testament passage
called on slaves to obey their masters, the pope compared the
struggle to recognize mutual subjection of the spouses _ ``and not
just that of the wife to the husband'' _ to the historical struggle
against slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist leaders are not apt to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a scholar to be able to interpret what is
clearly laid out in God's blueprint for the family,'' Mary Mohler,
who helped draft the declaration, told the Southern Baptists' press
service this week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what all these Christians, from the Southern Baptists
to the pope, might agree upon is that in contemporary society,
nobody wants to be subject to anyone, mutually or not. But that is
another story.

THE TRUTH DOES MATTER _ AND SO DO THE CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMATA 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only people for whom nothing changes with the latest ruling
in the Fells Acres sexual abuse case are the children.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant is vindicated; the prosecutor is aggrieved. But
what of the children at the heart of this case, children who put
their trust in adults, first in the schoolroom and then in the
courtroom, only to be cruelly betrayed in one or both places?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond describing their testimony of rape and sexual assault as
``forever tainted'' by the leading questions of ``overzealous''
investigators, Judge Isaac Borenstein does not have much to say
about those children in a 140-page decision that overturns the
11-year-old conviction of the late Violet Amirault and grants a new
trial to her daughter, Cheryl LeFave.
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers now, these boys and girls have been since preschool
the phantoms of the Fells Acres case, their anonymous pain merely
theoretical alongside the tear-stained tableaux of an elderly woman
and her two adult children insisting on their innocence.
(Amirault's son, Gerald, remains in prison, convicted of similar
charges during a separate trial in 1986.)
</P>
<P>
   The zeal of ``biased'' prosecutors produced ``dual tragedies''
in the Fells Acres case, according to the judge: The rights of the
defendants and the opportunity to uncover the truth about the
children's allegations were both irreparably compromised. But,
curiously, Judge Borenstein addresses only one of those
``tragedies'' in a decision that focuses on the legitimate need to
protect the liberty of the falsely accused but ignores the equally
compelling need to insure the safety of the truly abused.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that it is ``not the responsibility of this court to
decide the ultimate question of Cheryl Amirault LeFave's guilt or
innocence,'' Judge Borenstein makes it clear that he thinks
Amirault and LeFave, respectively the owner and a teacher at the
Fells Acres day care center in Malden, were victims of public
``panic, if not hysteria'' about child abuse in the mid-80s.
</P>
<P>
   But his is not the universal view. The Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court reviewed this case three times and concluded that
there was independent evidence to support the children's claims.
Justice Charles Fried, writing for the majority in March 1997,
found the children's testimony bolstered by ``the evidence of
physical injury, and the parents' testimony regarding the bizarre,
disturbed, and inappropriately sexualized behavior of their
children and the extent to which these factors corroborated each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent research on the suggestibility of children constitutes
``new evidence,'' according to Judge Borenstein, supporting the
defense contention that the children were made to believe that
horrors happened to them that never actually occurred. Because of
the ``grave errors'' made in the pre-trial questioning of the
children, ``their testimony has been forever rendered unreliable.
Although honest, the overwhelming evidence shows that there is a
grave risk the child witnesses were mistaken, through no fault of
their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave these children? Sexually abused by
ill-intentioned caregivers? Manipulated by well-intentioned crime
fighters? The judge says it does not matter: The children's
perceptions were so distorted by suggestive interviewing techniques
that their testimony would be inadmissible in a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth does matter, if not in court, then surely in the
lives of these children. It matters not just for them, but for all
children who find themselves at the center of such a storm. There
is little likelihood the Fells Acres case will ever be retried _
even if Judge Borenstein's decision is overturned, why would these
families subject themselves to another trial? _ but it is just as
unlikely that we have seen the last case of child sexual abuse in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Judge Borenstein's ruling might serve as public
notice that the criminal justice system is the wrong venue for the
resolution of child abuse cases. There are just too many
adult-sized hurdles for a pint-sized person to clear. If the courts
find children, with their malleable memories and their suggestible
minds, such unreliable witnesses, how can they ever be found to be
real victims? &UR;  &LR; The sexual abuse of children happens in secret,
after all; there are rarely adult witnesses. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Judge Borenstein spends 140 &UR;  &LR; pages addressing the rights of the
accused and not a line considering the plight of children. They
can't trust their parents not to twist their words. They can't
trust their therapists not to mold their memories. They can't trust
prosecutors not to reshape events according to their own biases.
</P>
<P>
   Who then should children trust?

FAMILY SEEKS JUSTICE, PLANS PRIVATE FUNERAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ In the midst of worldwide media attention, the
family of James Byrd Jr. prepared for a private funeral and burial
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a 49-year-old father of three and grandfather, was slain
almost a week ago when he was chained to the bumper of a pickup
truck and dragged for almost three miles along a back country road
east of his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   His funeral will be at the Greater New Bethel Baptist Church a
block from the home where he grew up, a church where he spent much
of his time as a child and where his father and namesake is still a
deacon.
</P>
<P>
   Although more famous preachers, like the Rev. Jesse Jackson, are
expected to be in attendance and may participate, the eulogy will
be presented by the Rev. Kenneth Lyons, pastor of the little
church, Byrd's family said.
</P>
<P>
   Clara Taylor, a Houston schoolteacher who is one of Byrd's six
sisters, asked news reporters to let the family have some time to
themselves. She said her family has no hate for the three white men
being held in the Jasper County jail charged with her brother's
brutal death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use the world hate here,'' she said, motioning toward
the front door of her parents' modest home. ``We just want justice
done.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her brother, a one-time vacuum cleaner salesman, who
was known for his gift of gab and fine singing voice, would be
amused by all the attention his death has attracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say, `All this for James Byrd? Well, well,''' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   As she stood on the front porch a string of neighbors, white and
black, came through the door bringing food, in the tradition of
small towns. Across Jasper flags stood at half-staff. Many street
corners, doors on businesses, trees and coat lapels featured yellow
ribbons distributed as a symbol of the town's support.
</P>
<P>
   The crime has touched other places as well. President Clinton
telephoned Byrd's mother Thursday to express his condolences,
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the family is grateful for all of the support, but
worries that some would use her brother's murder as a reason to
hate. ``We hope it doesn't cause any kind of violence and
division,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her brother's death can help some people realize that
ignorance and hate is a great evil, she said. ``We need to get at
the cause,'' she said. ``We're dealing with the symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   An eighth-grade science teacher at Burbank Middle School in
Houston, Taylor said only education can help curb racism. ``These
boys did not get that way overnight,'' she said of the three
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read about atrocities in other places and never here,''
she said. ``People say, `Something needs to be done,' and that's
how it always ends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper, about 130 miles northeast of Houston, is planning a
communitywide prayer service at the courthouse square Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's funeral, Taylor said, ``will be a time for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon and evening more than 200 people paid their
respects by visiting the funeral home where Byrd's body lay in a
dark gray casket. While Byrd's family was grieving, some who came
to Jasper seemed to be less interested in peace than in their
version of justice for a horrible crime.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting the Koran's dictate that murderers should be put to
death in the same manner in which they kill, Houston Black Muslim
minister Quanell X said the three defendants ``should be tied to
the very same bumper Brother Byrd was tied to and dragged down
Interstate 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by black-uniformed bodyguards, he said his entourage
brought a cache of weapons to be distributed to the black residents
of Jasper. The weapons would be used, he said, to defend blacks
against any threat posed by Ku Klux Klan or other white hate
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give them the same hell they give us,'' said the
former Nation of Islam youth minister.
</P>
<P>
   Several other groups are expected to appear Saturday in Jasper,
including a delegation from Dallas representing the New Black
Panthers, as well as spokesmen for the Nation of Islam.

FELLS ACRES IS THE LATEST OF PUBLICIZED ABUSE CASES TO BE
OVERTURNED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The names symbolized an era: Virginia McMartin, Kelly Michaels,
Little Rascals, Fells Acres, Amirault.
</P>
<P>
   Each belonged to a daycare center or its operators, and over the
course of two decades each became shorthand for cases of sexual
abuse of young children _ and the trials which unfolded amid a
highly charged, national campaign against sexual abuse that many
said was long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   But in time, each sensational case crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Convictions, built on the sometimes outlandish testimony of
small children, collapsed, one by one, in appeals courts. Of the
dozens of daycare center operators jailed for child molestation in
the 1980s, only a handful _ including Gerald Amirault, a defendant
in the Fells Acres case _ remain behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   For supporters of defendants' rights, the ruling by Judge Isaac
Borenstein in favor of Cheryl Amirault LeFave, Gerald's sister,
marked a clear victory in the war against so-called ``abuse
movement zealots,'' whose efforts created unprecedented national
concern for child molestation and led to an increase of reported
incidents in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And according to one of LeFave's supporters, Borenstein's
decision pounded ``another nail in the coffin, and a big one.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``There is never going to be another one of these massive
abuse cases again,'' said writer Dorothy Rabinowitz, a longtime
opponent of the national wave of child sexual abuse cases.
</P>
<P>
   To victims' rights supporters, the decision represented another
symbolic blow against the movement to punish offenders. Yet they
acknowlege the process of prosecuting child molesters has changed
since its inception, as the public has become ``highly skeptical''
of children's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Over the years, we have become much more cautious about
allegations. The protocol has changed,'' said Kathleen Faller, a
professor of social work at the University of Michigan. ``But a lot
of it is merely a response to the legal system, and is not
necessarily good for kids. It's an uphill battle now.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest and by far most notorious battle began in
California with a mother's phone call to police in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The woman reported her son had been abused while in the care
of the Virginia McMartin Preschool, a daycare center in the wealthy
community of Manhattan Beach. The claim led to a massive
investigation involving more than 200 current and former families
and children who attended the school, and, ultimately, a case that
cost $15 million to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   McMartin, her son and five others were ultimately indicted for
abusing several dozen children in their care. &UR;  &LR; The charges ranged
from horrifying to bizarre; more than 20 children told police about
not only incidents of rape and sodomy, but also rituals of animal
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Before it ended seven years later, the McMartin defendants were
dragged through two lengthy trials. Two of them _ Peggy Ann Buckey,
the founder's daughter, and Raymond Buckey, the founder's grandson
_ each spent time in jail before a jury deadlocked in 1990 and the
case was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, another landmark case fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Kelly Michaels, convicted in 1988 of abusing 19 children in
the New Jersey daycare center where she worked, walked out of jail
after serving five years of her sentence. An appeals court found
the case against her so outrageous it overturned the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; And just last year, prosecutors in North Carolina abandoned
their pursuit of the operators of the Little Rascals day care
center, where 29 children had alleged incidents of sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In what was reportedly the longest and most expensive case in
the state, owner Robert F. Kelly Jr. and Kathryn Dawn Wilson, the
cook, were both convicted and spent time behind bars. Their
convictions were ultimately overturned, but in the aftermath one
local columnist compared the ordeal to the 1692 Salem witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in the witch trials, good and decent citizens were falsely
accused of the most horrendous crimes and some were convicted based
solely on the evidence of children,'' columnist Perry Young wrote
in the Chapel Hill, N.C. Herald. ``If an adult talked of space
ships or shooting babies, it would rightly be discounted or
impeached.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Effectively echoing that sentiment, Judge Borenstein Friday
forbade the testimony of children who testified in the original
Amirault trial, labeling their comments ``forever tainted'' by
investigators' leading, repetitive questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Amirault case broke in September 1984, when Gerald Amirault
was arrested after a five-year-old told his mother he was molested
at the school. Within weeks, the school was closed as other
children came forward with similar allegations.
</P>
<P>
   By January 1985, LeFave, her mother and brother were indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Amirault was convicted in 1986 and sentenced to 30 to 40
years; his mother and sister were found guilty the following year,
and sent away for 8 to 20 years. The case their lawyers had begun
the first in a series of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But Borenstein's decision placed the Amirault case into the
realm of similar prosecutions that ultimately disintegrated. And it
heartened opponents who for years had perceived Massachusetts as
out of step with the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' said defense attorney Harvey Silverglate,
``somebody had to start saying the emperor had no no clothes.''

AGENCY CUTS BUDGET TO PUT SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission decided Friday to reduce
by more than 40 percent the budget of a plan to connect schools and
libraries to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Under bipartisan pressure from members of Congress who
maintained that the program would increase long-distance telephone
rates, the commission agreed to trim the program. All three of the
Democrats on the commission voted in favor of the plan, while the
two Republicans opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, $1.275 billion will be raised for the
program this year, down from an original maximum of $2.25 billion.
Long-distance carriers are required to provide most of the money.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 schools and libraries have applied for about $2.02
billion from the program. Under the plan approved Friday, fewer
than two-thirds of those requests will be granted, which will skew
the distribution of money toward the poorest school systems.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has already raised $625 million for the program.
Under the plan approved Friday, it will raise another $650 million
between July 1 and the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne E. Bradley, a lobbyist in Washington for the American
Library Association, said, ``Clearly we're disappointed that it
will put a lot of schoolkids and libraries on hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally a relatively obscure offshoot of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, the schools and libraries program
became the subject of a hard-fought political debate last week when
four powerful members of Congress urged the commission to cut off
its funding altogether.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp., the two biggest
long-distance carriers, have said in recent months that they
intended to pass the cost of their contributions to the program on
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   That set off a blast of protest on Capitol Hill, aimed at the
FCC and in particular at the commission's chairman, William
Kennard. Kennard had already angered many members of Congress by
pushing for free air time for political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard Friday acknowledged the need for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to fund at the full $2.25 billion rate,'' he said,
``there would probably be some upward pressure on long-distance
rates. My goal has been to have both lower rates and more money for
universal service.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the commission and Congress have been testy
for years. The two institutions have been battling over the proper
implementation of the Telecommunications Act, which was meant to
deregulate many elements of the communications market.

<P>
   The fight over the schools and libraries program has become
perhaps the commission's most important battle. The program enjoys
the favor of Vice President Al Gore, who has taken particular
interest in the Internet and other forms of advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC blew it,'' said Thomas Bliley, R-Va., who serves as
chairman of the House Commerce Committee, which oversees the
commission. ``Thanks to that agency and Vice President Gore, the
American people, including less-fortunate Americans, are stuck with
higher phone rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the program contend that the FCC illegally exceeded
its authority when it established a quasi-independent corporation
to disburse money to libraries and schools. On Friday the
commission agreed to merge the schools and libraries corporation
into the organization that administers subsidies to limit phone
rates in rural areas. &QL;

HOUSTON FIRM UNDER THE GUN TO FIX ARMY TRUCKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A design flaw in trucks built by Houston-based
Stewart &AMP; Stevenson Services for the U.S. Army causes vehicles to
tip or roll over when driven at higher speeds, military and company
officials confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While company officials hope to unveil a solution to the problem
as early as Monday, the Army has ordered drivers operating more
than 6,000 Stewart &AMP; Stevenson trucks to slow down to 30 mph.
</P>
<P>
   And the Pentagon has decided not to award Stewart &AMP; Stevenson a
new $1.4 billion contract to build additional trucks until the flaw
is corrected.
</P>
<P>
   The Army sounded the alarm about the 2.5-ton trucks in March,
after the vehicles were involved in three separate highway
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators blame the mishaps on severe engine vibration,
which became most pronounced when empty vehicles were driven at
speeds above 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   That vibration caused the trucks' drive shafts to break lose.
And in two of the accidents, those flailing drive shafts struck the
trucks' air brake lines, which set off the vehicles' emergency
braking systems.
</P>
<P>
   Caught unaware, the drivers lost control of their vehicles. One
truck rolled over on its top, while another fell over on its side.
</P>
<P>
   In a third incident, the drive shaft missed the brake line, and
the operator was able to bring the vehicle safely to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers in these mishaps suffered only minor injuries. But
when Army officials identified potential problems in at least 170
vehicles, the Army set a lower speed limit, not only for the
company's 2.5-ton trucks but for a 5-ton class as well.
</P>
<P>
   LaRoy Hammer, Stewart &AMP; Stevenson's senior vice president, said
the vibration problem was not identified, despite more than a
million miles worth of testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't replicate this incident,'' Hammer said. ``Were we
stupid, or was it a situation where we should have known? I guess
we could beat each other to death over that.''
</P>
<P>
   To fix the flaw, Stewart &AMP; Stevenson _ working in conjunction
with engine-maker Caterpillar, General Motors' Allison Transmission
division and drivetrain maker Meritor _ has designed a new bracket
that company officials expect will eliminate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer said he expects the company to finish testing the bracket
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This coming Monday, we will have sufficient data for me to
publicly announce the fix is in place,'' Hammer predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials plan to install the brackets on both the
2.5-ton and 5-ton vehicles. Both Stewart &AMP; Stevenson and its
contractors plan to share the cost of the repair work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost is not that significant,'' Hammer said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Army has experienced 13 accidents with the Stewart
&AMP; Stevenson trucks, but only three have been attributed to the
mechanical trouble. The others have all been blamed on driver
error.
</P>
<P>
   Better known as a maker and distributor of diesel and gas
turbine engines, Stewart &AMP; Stevenson has agreed to build nearly
11,000 trucks for the Army under a multiyear, $1.4 billion
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The company has only delivered about 6,000 of those trucks so
far, to be used both on the road as well as on unpaved terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The Stewart &AMP; Stevenson contract is just one phase of the Army's
30-year, $15.9 billion effort to replace its aging truck fleet with
more than 85,000 new vehicles, an Army spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart &AMP; Stevenson already has negotiated a contract with the
Army to build another 8,500 trucks, ranging in price from $100,000
to $260,000 apiece, Hammer said. Like the initial contract, that
work order could be worth $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the military is holding off on that contract until the
vibration issue is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes back to basic consumerism,'' a Defense Department
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the military is of critical import for Stewart &AMP;
Stevenson. The company's Tactical Vehicle Systems unit accounted
for about 36 percent of the company's sales last year. And the U.S.
government is the unit's primary customer.
</P>
<P>
   As the company noted in a recent filing with the U.S. Securities
&AMP; Exchange Commission: ``The loss of this customer would have a
material adverse effect on the company's consolidated future
financial condition and results of operation.''
</P>
<P>
   George Gaspar, an analyst with Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in
Milwaukee, doesn't believe the Army will turn to some other
competitor to build the next batch of trucks. Gaspar figures the
military would have to delay the program by another two to three
years to certify another supplier to provide the new trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be able to solve this problem,'' Baird said. ``I
don't think this is insurmountable.''

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 14) 
(af) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ What makes a perfect country club? It should be ``a
haven of refuge'' dedicated to ``the genuine care and comfort of
our members,'' said Robert Dedman Sr., founder and chairman of Club
Corp. International, a leading operator of country clubs and other
such genteel gathering spots.
</P>
<P>
   It should be a civilized place, he said, one that can be proudly
shown to your friends, where the staff addresses you by name _ ``at
least four times during each visit'' _ and always remembers your
favorite cocktail. And while it should be a place where your
opinions are sought and respected, ``a club is not meant to be a
debating society and a place of disputation.''
</P>
<P>
   A surprising number of the company's clubs, though, have become
just that. In the last two years, at least seven of Clubcorp's 70
country clubs have produced lawsuits filed by either members,
homeowners or, in one case, a club's co-owner.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints _ roundly rejected by the company _ go to the
heart of what many members look for when they pay thousands of
dollars a year to join a club: privilege and prestige.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the clubs found in the novels of Auchincloss and
O'Hara. Of the 10,000 or so country clubs in America, about half
are that sort _ nonprofit ``equity clubs'' owned and operated by
members. Most of the rest are run for profit, usually by a
management company like Clubcorp, which might lease the club
property or own it outright or in partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the lawsuits contend that in Clubcorp's case, members
lose out. The company, which makes reciprocal privileges among its
clubs a big selling point, lets too many outsiders use the clubs in
popular resort areas, some unhappy members contend.
</P>
<P>
   These include members of the Indian Wells Country Club in
California, familiar to armchair golfers as a regular site of the
Bob Hope Chrysler Classic tournament, who are seeking arbitration
of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Others accuse Clubcorp of breaking its promises to maintain high
standards and of draining away club resources. A few cases have
involved accusations of remarkably rough-handed tactics by the
company, steps that seemed intended to silence critics _ even when
those critics were club members.
</P>
<P>
   Terry A. Taylor, senior vice president and general counsel for
Clubcorp, acknowledged that the number of lawsuits against the
company is higher than it has been for several years but emphasized
that it is still ``negligible for a company our size.'' Moreover,
he said, the company has already prevailed in some disputes and
expects to do so in all of them.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the company's clubby Dallas offices, Robert
H. Dedman Jr., who succeeded his father as chief executive last
year, grew angry at questions about the flurry of litigation.
``This is a very, very minor issue,'' he said. ``Occasionally we
may not make everybody happy. But we have built an excellent
business'' by pleasing members.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is Clubcorp's reputation for treating members with
kid gloves that makes all the disputes so surprising. ``That is the
most litigation against a management company that I've heard of,''
said James Singerling, a 35-year veteran of the golf industry who
is executive director of the Club Managers Association of America,
in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Besides country clubs, Clubcorp owns six golf resorts, including
the Homestead in Hot Springs, Va., and the Pinehurst Resort in
North Carolina, where the 1999 United States Open will take place.
It also owns or operates 70 city dining clubs, including the
Metropolitan Club in Chicago, and 24 city athletic clubs, like the
San Francisco Tennis Club.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it says, its clubs had almost 230,000 members as of
January, making it a giant in a fragmented field. Its principal
rival is the American Golf Corp. of Santa Monica, Calif., perhaps
best known for its management of top-notch public courses.
</P>
<P>
   Here in its hometown, there is considerable speculation that
Clubcorp, which is now family-controlled, will soon sell shares to
the public, and Dedman Sr., who is 73, does not deny it. ``The
closer I get to all my stock going to public institutions _ which
is where it will go _ the closer we will come'' to some change in
the company's status, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Clubcorp is the best proof of the money to be made by
marketing what the company calls the ``private club experience,''
the disputes show that careful attention to the fine print and a
clear understanding of how clubs are governed are as important to
potential members as a strong tee shot and a grasp of golfing
etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   The Dedmans reject the suggestion that Clubcorp ignores the
wishes of members _ even though, unlike those who belong to
member-owned clubs, they have only those rights Clubcorp gives
them, aside from contract-law protections enforceable in court.
Members of for-profit clubs, the Dedmans point out, have no
obligation to finance club deficits. And since they are typically
leading citizens, they have no trouble being heard, Dedman Jr.
added.
</P>
<P>
   Clubcorp's surveys show that 87 percent of members think their
clubs ``met or exceeded'' expectations; the rest, he noted, can
always leave.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting enough members to replace those who do resign has
been a challenge, at least in recent years. Mirroring industry
trends, Clubcorp added just 25 net new members in 1993, when club
dues lost their status as a tax deduction, and membership shrank
slightly in each of the next three years, according to company
financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, though, membership at clubs it has owned more than 18
months grew by 3,171, or about 1.6 percent. (Though private,
Clubcorp files financial statements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission because it has so many employee shareholders.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, steadily adding clubs in the 90s, Clubcorp has grown into
a major force in golfing, with assets at the end of last year of
just over $1 billion. In 1997, it reported revenues of $840
million, up 34 percent over five years, and profits of $121.9
million, up 119 percent in that period. And it is poised to grow
larger, with a $300 million credit line that it intends to use for
additional acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The company bears the strong stamp of Dedman Sr., described by
one industry executive as ``the Henry Ford of the club management
business.'' His energy is legendary: in just four years after high
school, according to a company biography, he earned degrees in
engineering, economics and law, served two years in the Navy and
worked full time for two years during law school. From humble
Arkansas roots, he rose to become personal counsel to the oil
billionaire H.L. Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid '50s, noticing how the new Thunderbird Country Club
improved property values in the area of Palm Springs, Calif., he
envisioned a company that would develop and manage clubs for
profit. In 1957, he opened Brookhaven Country Club in Dallas, with
three 18-hole courses, and it became the seed of Clubcorp. Today,
he is regularly included in Golf Digest's listings of the most
powerful figures in golf and is in the top third of Forbes' list of
the 400 richest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   At the company, Dedman and his son, who became chief financial
officer in 1987 after a three-year stint at Salomon Brothers, are
known as ``Robert'' and ``Bob'' _ the son preferred that to ``Bob''
and ``Bobby.'' Outside, both are known as tough businessmen _ the
younger Dedman's personality is ``stronger than bull meat,'' said
Byron Barlow, a member of Clubcorp's Las Colinas Country Club in
Irving, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Barlow, among a half-dozen members whose names were supplied
by Clubcorp, had nothing but praise for its performance at his
club. ``They have the strength of management, the continuity of
management and the economies of scale to make the deal work, and
member satisfaction is very high,'' he said, though he added that
Las Colinas voted to decline reciprocal privileges rather than open
its doors to members of other Clubcorp properties.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the list were similarly delighted. ``Clubcorp made a
lot of commitments up-front, some of them oral, and I can't think
of a single one they have not lived up to,'' said Bob Millan, at
Glen Oaks Country Club in West Des Moines, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   If all members were as happy as these, Clubcorp's lawyers would
not have been so busy lately.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who are not happy are the clients of M. David Bland,
a lawyer who represents homeowners in the Village of Raintree, a
1,600-home planned community just outside Charlotte, N.C., who have
sued Clubcorp over its operation of the Raintree Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every single time they told us something, it turned out
not to be correct,'' Bland said. Clubcorp took over the lease to
operate Raintree in November 1985. The club, its golf course and
the community's other open spaces are owned by the homeowners
associations.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1992, the homeowners sued Clubcorp's local affiliate,
filing a complaint that accused the company of defaulting on the
terms of its lease by exceeding a pre-existing membership limit and
by allowing the club to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit dragged on, and in July 1996, Elizabeth Smith,
president of a Raintree homeowner group, saw construction equipment
rolling onto a knoll on the edge of a fairway.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, it turned out, to build a concrete bunker the size
of a two-car garage, on top of which would be a 150-foot
cellular-phone tower. Furious, Ms. Smith got her camera and called
her lawyer, Bland.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, when there was no response to his letter
warning that homeowners considered the tower a violation of
Clubcorp's lease, the homeowners terminated the agreement,
according to court records. Clubcorp resisted, and Bland obtained a
court order last June evicting the company.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the company's general counsel, said there was nothing
illegal or improper about the tower, which he said is simply ``a
flagpole, and somewhat attractive at that.''
</P>
<P>
   The court has appointed a receiver to run the club while
Clubcorp appeals, but Bland pointed out that an appellate victory
would simply give Clubcorp the right to defend itself in the
original 1992 lawsuit _ which, he said, had been rendered moot by
the eviction order.
</P>
<P>
   The long battle has left its scars on the club's atmosphere, Ms.
Smith said. ``My friends tell me that it is just not as much of a
warm and friendly place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Raintree was not alone in complaining that Clubcorp exceeded
membership limits. Discontent over golfers with reciprocal
privileges using members' supposedly private fairways is cited in
almost all the recent disputes. But it is an especially sore point
at Indian Wells.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Clubcorp joined with a nonprofit corporation formed by
club members to buy the mountain-ringed property at auction. The
members' corporation contributed half the purchase price of about
$15 million and kept title to the land; Clubcorp acquired the
clubhouse and other physical property, along with the right to
operate the golf oasis as a private club.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1997, the number of visiting golfers led to an angry
exchange of letters between Clubcorp's local manager and the
chairman of the member-owned corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a considerable amount of unrest at Indian Wells,''
wrote Richard Roemer, chairman of the members' company.
``Management has opened the golf course to outside play and
tournaments during the May-through-October period to such an extent
that the club is, in effect, a public facility.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager, Doug Howe, had argued in an earlier letter that the
revenue generated by visiting players was essential, because the
club had not attracted enough new members. The dissident members
countered that it would be easier to sell new memberships if that
was the only way golfers could enjoy the club _ and if Clubcorp had
operated Indian Wells as a first-class club.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Sardella, an outspoken member of the nonprofit
corporation's board, as well as the club's advisory board,
complained that Clubcorp ``just didn't do what they said they would
_ this is not a private club, as they promised it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Roemer's December letter, which requested arbitration, gave
Clubcorp formal notice that in the members' view it had failed to
comply with its lease.
</P>
<P>
   Dedman Sr. visited Indian Wells a few weeks ago, meeting with
both the advisory board, which reports to Clubcorp management, and
directors of the nonprofit corporation. The dispute, still
unresolved, resulted from ``miscommunication'' between those
groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clubcorp reports that on average, only about 1 percent of the
rounds played at its clubs are by golfers exercising reciprocal
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Clubcorp seems to have resolved a similar dispute at the
handsome Canyon Gate Country Club, situated within a gated
community in Las Vegas _ but not before being sued by a half-dozen
members over the number of visiting golfers. Records subpoenaed
from the club showed that ``often more than 20 percent of the tee
times were going to unaccompanied nonmembers,'' said Douglas A.
Mitchell, the lawyer who represented Canyon Gate members.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, Clubcorp's general counsel, said the plaintiffs
represented a small group of malcontents. The suit was settled,
Mitchell said, when Clubcorp and the members negotiated limits on
outside play. So far, he said, his clients seem happy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some disputes Clubcorp has faced in recent years focused on
allegations that it had drained away assets and maintained
haphazard ledgers to obscure misuse of revenues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one such case, Clubcorp was sued in 1996 by two members of
the Errol Estates Country Club in Apopka, Fla., after it announced
plans to convert the club into a semipublic course. The case was
settled when Clubcorp sold the facility to members in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute was long in developing, said one member of the
club's advisory board, Grant Shrum. For years, Shrum said,
excessive use and poor maintenance had caused the golf course to
deteriorate seriously. ``They just used up the assets of this
club,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor denied that, saying Clubcorp had simply decided Errol
Estates could not survive economically as a private club and was
happy to sell it to members. The lawsuit, he said, was simply an
attempt to push down Clubcorp's asking price.
</P>
<P>
   The members are now rebuilding the club and attracting new
golfers, Shrum said. But he added that the club found itself with a
financial overhang from Clubcorp's accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
   Errol Estates, he said, must raise nearly $2 million in the
coming decades to meet its obligation to refund deposits that
Clubcorp had collected from new members. Though the company had
promised refunds after 30 years, it did not set aside money for
that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, according to Clubcorp's financial disclosures, it
treated such deposits at its clubs as tax-free, long-term loans,
which exceeded $380 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   James Hinckley, president of Clubcorp's country clubs and
resorts division, said the deposits were treated as income by each
club, which used them to finance capital improvements or other
expenses. Deposits will be refunded out of cash flow, Taylor added,
and remain a liability of each club.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the nastiest dispute over Clubcorp's financial
record-keeping pits it against Tohato Inc., a Japanese snack-food
company and a partner in the Pinewild Country Club development
adjacent to the Pinehurst resort in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Tohato sued Clubcorp, accusing it of fraudulently
enriching itself at Tohato's expense. When two Tohato executives in
Pinehurst publicly accused Clubcorp of ``racketeering'' and other
crimes _ and encouraged law-enforcement agencies to investigate _
Clubcorp sued for libel. This month, it won a preliminary
injunction silencing the executives.
</P>
<P>
   While law-enforcement agents have questioned participants in
some Clubcorp disputes, their agencies will not comment. Clubcorp
says the inquiries were prompted solely by false statements from
Tohato. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite these messy disputes, Clubcorp executives emphasize that
a vast majority of members are happy, and that may well be true.
But the bylaws at many of its clubs and its aggressive legal
tactics make it risky for club members to be anything but happy _
at least publicly.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pinehurst Country Club, a private club for local
residents on the grounds of the Pinehurst Resort, members had
obtained a consent decree from a prior owner that gave them
significant protections, including limits on dues increases and
excessive play by resort guests.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1990, six years after Clubcorp bought the resort, it
precipitated a legal battle when it sought to reinterpret the
consent decree. After members prevailed at trial on many points,
the company won a reversal on appeal in 1996; the case is awaiting
reconsideration by the lower court.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995, in the midst of the dispute, one club member,
Edmund E. Dietrich, wrote a letter to the local newspaper, citing
employee complaints that tips were not being fully disbursed to
them. According to court documents, Clubcorp's lawyers demanded a
retraction.

<P>
   Dietrich, 72, agreed to apologize if Clubcorp would show him
records refuting the employee complaints. He returned from a
holiday trip in December 1995 to find that Clubcorp had sued him
for libel and slander.
</P>
<P>
   Clubcorp withdrew the suit in October 1996, just before Dietrich
was to inspect the financial records. But Dietrich incurred more
than $5,000 in legal fees and many anxious moments, he said later.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said Clubcorp sued because its Pinehurst employees asked
the company ``to take a stand, because what he said was not true.''
Local managers simply felt Dietrich ``went too far, and they
decided that enough was enough,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing Clubcorp has also produced anxious moments for some
members of the Porter Valley Country Club in Northridge, Calif. A
group of members there have sued Clubcorp, accusing it of exceeding
the club's membership cap and then lying to the advisory board
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the lawsuit was based on allegations from a
disgruntled former employee and was without merit. ``I fear
truthfully that some of those members joined that action without
realizing what they were getting into,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clubcorp is making things clear. As it is entitled to do
under club bylaws, it has added a pro-rated amount of its
substantial legal expenses to the plaintiffs' monthly statements of
club charges. Not surprisingly, several plaintiffs have withdrawn
from the suit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Was all this ``disputation'' avoidable? One has to consider the
source of the complaints, Dedman Sr. said. ``I've never been aware
of any of these disputes being started by highly successful people
who run highly successful businesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I am not aware of any lawsuits we've lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dedman attributes his company's success to gracious
accommodation, not legal aggression. ``Our No. 1 rule has always
been that the members are always right,'' he said with a grin.
``Our No. 2 rule is, anytime a member may appear to be wrong,
remember rule No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   And his company's culture drills that lesson into the hearts and
minds of its local club managers through an extensive program of
management training, top executives said. As Dedman Jr. put it,
``We're actually in the relationship business.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having tamed squeegee men and cabbies, murderers and
muggers, he has quietly been bracing for all manner of human
treachery and cataclysms, building a $15.1 million emergency
control center for his administration _ bullet-proofed, hardened to
withstand bombs and hurricanes, and equipped with food and beds for
at least 30 members of his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious project, which will sprawl over 46,000 feet in one
of the smaller buildings of the World Trade Center complex, will be
large enough to accommodate at least 50 different city, state and
federal agencies, and will allow them to coordinate responses to a
myriad of disasters, from the smallest sewer explosion to the
largest nerve gas attack.
</P>
<P>
   Among its amenities will be back-up generators in case of power
failures, a storage tank with enough water to last at least a week,
and whiz-bang technology that will include a secure ``red'' phone
for the mayor and video-conferencing, so he can see and talk to the
president of the United States, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the facility is ``not a bunker'' meant as a safety
haven for the mayor, Jerome Hauer, head of the city's Office of
Emergency Management, noted that New York City's emergency response
system had become a model for other cities and said that the
planned center was a natural next step in keeping that lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something the city has needed for a long time, a
state-of-the-art center with a sophisticated communications system,
that is survivable so the city can continue to function,'' he said.
``If there is a citywide blackout, a hurricane, a blizzard, this is
the facility that will allow us to keep working, to make sure that
people are not in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the news of the center's construction troubled many in city
government, especially City Council members, who were not notified
of the project. Some noted that the existing command center on the
eighth floor of police headquarters has functioned admirably during
a variety of storms, blackouts and terrorist attacks. Councilwoman
Kathryn Freed, whose district will house the new center, also
questioned whether the investment was fiscally prudent at a time
when the mayor has threatened to cut funding for senior citizens
centers, city hospitals and services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when the mayor is screaming and yelling about pork
in city government and trying to cut city services that keep
libraries and day care centers open, it seems bizarre to me that
the city would be putting nearly $16 million into a rented space
that the city doesn't even own,'' Ms. Freed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a $16 million improvement to another guy's building?''
she said. ``I sure hope this is a 99-year lease.''

   WASHINGTON _ NATO's coming show of strength in Albania and
Macedonia is clearly meant to represent its resolve to stop the
Yugoslav crackdown on separatists in Kosovo. Then there is the
military exercise's code name, announced Friday: ``Operation
Determined Falcon.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a name for the military exercise, which could begin
as early as Sunday, NATO's military commanders passed over the
usual workaday choices like ``Operation Deliberate Force,'' the
name for the air strikes in Bosnia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they invoked the falcon, a symbol that is at the heart
of Serbian history and lore and will almost certainly be recognized
by the Serbs who dominate the Yugoslav state but are a minority in
the predominantly ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1389 the Serbian leader Prince Lazar is said to have dreamed
of a falcon on the eve of the Battle of Kosovo, the epic engagement
in which Turkish forces defeated the Serbs. In the dream, the
legend goes, the falcon offered Prince Lazar the choice between an
earthly kingdom and a celestial one.
</P>
<P>
   Lazar dies in the battle, having chosen the celestial kingdom,
but the defeat of the Serbs near Pristina, the modern capital of
Kosovo, has been a rallying cry for Serbian nationalists and a
historic root of Serbian animosity toward Kosovo's ethnic Albanians
and Bosnia's Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for NATO's military commanders, Col. Konrad Freytag,
said he did not know exactly how the planners had settled on the
name, but he said it was not, in itself, meant to convey any
significant political or symbolic meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Code names, he said, are chosen by military planners for clarity
and ease of communication, although he conceded that they sometimes
come to have symbolic significance.
</P>
<P>
   NATO will complete the details of the exercise Saturday. It is
expected to include 20 to 30 combat aircraft from eight NATO
nations, including the United States. The aircraft, based at
Aviano, Italy, will conduct mock bombing raids in Albania and
Macedonia, close to Kosovo's border. &QL;

FAMILY SEEKS JUSTICE, PLANS PRIVATE FUNERAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to list names of suspects in story) 
 
By RICHARD STEWART 
Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ In the midst of worldwide media attention, the
family of James Byrd Jr. prepared for a private funeral and burial
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a 49-year-old father of three and grandfather, was slain
almost a week ago when he was chained to the bumper of a pickup
truck and dragged for almost three miles along a back country road
east of his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   His funeral will be at the Greater New Bethel Baptist Church a
block from the home where he grew up, a church where he spent much
of his time as a child and where his father and namesake is still a
deacon.
</P>
<P>
   Although more famous preachers, like the Rev. Jesse Jackson, are
expected to be in attendance and may participate, the eulogy will
be presented by the Rev. Kenneth Lyons, pastor of the little
church, Byrd's family said.
</P>
<P>
   Clara Taylor, a Houston schoolteacher who is one of Byrd's six
sisters, asked news reporters to let the family have some time to
themselves. She said her family has no hate for the three white men
being held in the Jasper County jail charged with her brother's
brutal death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use the world hate here,'' she said, motioning toward
the front door of her parents' modest home. ``We just want justice
done.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her brother, a one-time vacuum cleaner salesman, who
was known for his gift of gab and fine singing voice, would be
amused by all the attention his death has attracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say, `All this for James Byrd? Well, well,''' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are John William ``Bill'' King, 23, of Jasper,
Shawn Berry, 23, of Jasper and Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 31 of
Sulphur Springs. Charged with murder, all three have previously
served prison sentences for burglary and other non-violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   As she stood on the front porch a string of neighbors, white and
black, came through the door bringing food, in the tradition of
small towns. Across Jasper flags stood at half-staff. Many street
corners, doors on businesses, trees and coat lapels featured yellow
ribbons distributed as a symbol of the town's support.
</P>
<P>
   The crime has touched other places as well. President Clinton
telephoned Byrd's mother Thursday to express his condolences,
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the family is grateful for all of the support, but
worries that some would use her brother's murder as a reason to
hate. ``We hope it doesn't cause any kind of violence and
division,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her brother's death can help some people realize that
ignorance and hate is a great evil, she said. ``We need to get at
the cause,'' she said. ``We're dealing with the symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   An eighth-grade science teacher at Burbank Middle School in
Houston, Taylor said only education can help curb racism. ``These
boys did not get that way overnight,'' she said of the three
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read about atrocities in other places and never here,''
she said. ``People say, `Something needs to be done,' and that's
how it always ends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper, about 130 miles northeast of Houston, is planning a
communitywide prayer service at the courthouse square Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's funeral, Taylor said, ``will be a time for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon and evening more than 200 people paid their
respects by visiting the funeral home where Byrd's body lay in a
dark gray casket. While Byrd's family was grieving, some who came
to Jasper seemed to be less interested in peace than in their
version of justice for a horrible crime.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting the Koran's dictate that murderers should be put to
death in the same manner in which they kill, Houston Black Muslim
minister Quanell X said the three defendants ``should be tied to
the very same bumper Brother Byrd was tied to and dragged down
Interstate 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by black-uniformed bodyguards, he said his entourage
brought a cache of weapons to be distributed to the black residents
of Jasper. The weapons would be used, he said, to defend blacks
against any threat posed by Ku Klux Klan or other white hate
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give them the same hell they give us,'' said the
former Nation of Islam youth minister.
</P>
<P>
   Several other groups are expected to appear Saturday in Jasper,
including a delegation from Dallas representing the New Black
Panthers, as well as spokesmen for the Nation of Islam.

ADVOCATES OF SCHOOL VOUCHERS HEARTENED BY RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wis., Conn., N.J.)   (bl)  
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Emboldened by a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision this
week permitting the use of taxpayer money to pay religious school
tuition, advocates for the use of school vouchers in the New York
area say they believe they now have fresh ammunition to press their
cause.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents said they were encouraged by the Wisconsin
justices' ruling that a Milwaukee voucher program giving tuition
money to parents, rather than directly to parochial schools, did
not violate the First Amendment's separation of church and state.
That, the justices said, is because the program's primary purpose
was not to advance religion.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal scholars believe the issue will become a test case
before the U.S. Supreme Court, and if the Wisconsin decision is
ultimately upheld, the advocates say, then the restrictions of
individual state constitutions would govern the use of vouchers. In
the aftermath of the ruling, they have begun assessing the hurdles
in their own state constitutions and the political prospects,
however difficult, within their legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, the organizers of a privately financed voucher
program said that the Wisconsin decision had provided them with
grist to lobby for taxpayer-supported vouchers as a solution to the
grave problems in the Hartford public schools; this in a state in
which the Republican governor, John Rowland, and one U.S. senator,
Joseph Lieberman, a Democrat, have expressed at least some support
for experimenting with vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the founders of a program that has awarded
privately financed vouchers to 2,200 public-school children during
the last two years said the Wisconsin decision could lead to an
intermediate step on the road to public vouchers: the awarding of
tax credits for parents who send their children to parochial and
other private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler, a Republican who has been a
leading voucher advocate in New Jersey, said that he was hastily
planning a lobbying blitz in support of already proposed
legislation, heretofore given little chance of enactment, that
would permit pilot voucher programs in every county.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have had a Supreme Court rule in Wisconsin that there is
no church-state problem with vouchers,'' said Schundler. ``That
suggests you will also see other state supreme courts rule in a
similar vein.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not necessarily true, even some advocates say. New
York, for instance, is one of 37 states that amended their state
constitutions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to restrict
the spending of public money on parochial schools, according to the
Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a public-interest law firm that
defends voucher programs. Most of those states acted after James G.
Blaine, a Republican presidential hopeful, failed in his bid in
1876 to attach such an amendment, widely described by scholars as
virulently anti-Catholic, to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the state constitution stipulates that no ``public
money,'' used ``directly or indirectly,'' may aid ``any school or
institution of learning wholly or in part under the control or
direction of any religious denomination or in which any
denominational tenet or doctrine is taught.''
</P>
<P>
   While New Jersey and Connecticut, like Wisconsin, have no such
provisions in their constitutions, the laws in each are ambiguous
enough to give advocates on both sides cause for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the Legislature is not permitted, under the
constitution, to ``borrow, appropriate or use'' the ``fund for the
support of free public schools'' for ``any other purpose.'' But the
state constitution stops short of an outright ban on using taxpayer
money to aid religious schools. The Connecticut constitution
declares that ``no law shall ever be made'' authorizing that the
``school fund'' be ``diverted to any other use than the
encouragement and support of public schools.'' But as in New
Jersey, it does not bar spending other public money on religious
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the courts in those states were to give their
blessing to the concept of spending taxpayer money on religious
schools, the political opposition would be strong.
</P>
<P>
   New York state, for example, has perhaps the most powerful
teachers union in the country _ indeed, it has been the
legislators' most generous campaign patron _ and its leaders have
been adamant in their opposition to vouchers, which they say would
threaten to siphon children, and the money spent on them, away from
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the lifeblood of public schools,'' said Randi
Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, the
New York City teachers' union. ``Either you believe in public
education or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the union's opposition, and the strong wording of the
constitution, proponents of vouchers within New York state hold out
little hope for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Flanigan, a Wall Street executive who helped organize the
privately financed voucher program in New York City last year, said
he believed that tax credits for parents who pay parochial or
private school tuition might pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who is the chairman of
the State Assembly's Education Committee, said the Assembly would
resist. ``If you were to allow tax credits,'' Sanders said, ``it
would merely be a circumvention around using tax dollars and state
aid as it exists now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, Lewis Andrews, the chairman and executive
director of the Children's Educational Opportunity Foundation of
America, has established private voucher programs for 125 public
school students in Bridgeport and 200 in Hartford. He said he would
lobby for a publicly financed voucher program for Hartford, whose
troubled school system is under the control of a state panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wisconsin decision gets people to realize it's maybe not a
religious issue, but an education issue,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Democratic-controlled state House of
Representatives deadlocked, 71-71, on a bill that would have
permitted publicly financed vouchers, sending it to defeat.
Subsequent measures did not pass out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think it is not a good place to put taxpayer
dollars into private and religious schools when there is no public
accountability for how those funds are spent,'' said Cameron
Staples, a Democrat who is the co-chairman of the state Assembly's
joint House-Senate Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman, a Republican, is a
supporter of publicly financed vouchers, but the Legislature
blocked a pilot voucher program in 1994. Now, the Legislature is
considering several similar bills, and Schundler said he was
confident that the Wisconsin justices' reasoning would change some
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question has always been,'' Schundler said, ``when do we
want to get our grass-roots supporters cranking to put pressure on
the Legislature? I think it's time to start cranking.''

WORLD CUP HOST TEAM IMPRESSIVE IN 3-0 WIN OVER SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>

   MARSEILLE, France _ Though the French were the driving force
behind the creation of soccer's World Cup, they never have managed
to reach the final of the event that Jules Rimet and Henri Delaunay
essentially launched in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   That streak may not end this summer, but anyone who watched the
French convincingly defeat South Africa, 3-0, Friday night in their
first World Cup match in 12 years knows that this team is a
legitimate threat to change its nation's luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope the French public understands, because it has been
fooled lately by the press,'' said French coach Aime Jacquet.
``This is a very good, very poised, very unselfish team. The door
is wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   The player most capable of holding it open throughout this
tournament is Jacquet's playmaker, Zinedine Zidane, a 25-year-old
midfielder who was born in Marseille and grew up in a public
housing development in one of its hardscrabble neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Algerian immigrants, Zidane has long been a symbol to
France's many residents of North African descent, but since leaving
Bordeaux to join Juventus of Turin in the Italian first division in
the summer of 1996, he has broadened his appeal and horizons
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   With Zidane at the controls, Juventus has won the last two
Italian league titles and reached two consecutive finals of the
Champion's League: Europe's most prestigious competition for clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A genius,'' Jacquet said recently of Zidane. ``Since going to
Italy, he's had to be at his best every weekend and has taken on a
new dimension. He is the one who can lift our level. With him, we
can win the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen, but with Zidane's remarkable
ball-control skills and unnerving knack for finding gaps with his
passes, the French were certainly able to win their opening match
in Group C despite a vicious and unseasonable Mistral wind that
played nasty tricks on the ball and made June in Marseille feel
more like March in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   People in the crowd of 60,000 in Marseille, which included
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, were chanting Zidane's
nickname ``Zizou'' before the game and in the early going, but
despite producing plenty several chances, it wasn't until the 34th
minute that Zizou produced a goal.
</P>
<P>
   It came off a corner kick, which he struck cleanly in the
direction of his close friend Christophe Dugarry, whose header
brushed the inside of the far goalpost and careened into the South
African net. Dugarry immediately embarked on a joyful, wide-eyed
sprint. It was a form of release for a young striker who was widely
considered a poor choice for the French national team after
struggling the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He did not start Friday night, but after Stephane Guivarch
strained ligaments in his left knee in the 26th minute, Dugarry
came off the bench. Three minutes later, he squandered the first
golden opportunity Zidane gave him, but he capitalized on the
second. He and Zidane own a bar called ``Nulle Part Ailleurs''
(Nowhere Else) in Bordeaux, and now they will have a good story to
tell their clients. ``I'm so happy for him,'' Zidane said later.
``He needed that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   France would get two more in the second half. In the 77th
minute, Dugarry passed to teammate Youri Djorkaeff who shot on goal
from 15 yards out. Goalkeeper Hans Vonk dove to his right and
appeared to be in good position to stop it, but before the ball
reached him, South African defender Pierre Issa lashed out with his
left foot and redirected the ball into his own goal. Issa, who
plays for Marseille's club team, was suddenly a very popular man
for the wrong reason.
</P>
<P>
   French striker Thierry Henry added a final goal in extra time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A perfect evening,'' said Henry, who like every member of the
French and South African teams was playing in his first World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   France last appeared in 1986 in Mexico, when Michel Platini was
its star and it finished third. Platini has since made the leap
from playmaker to deal-maker; he is co-president of France's World
Cup organizing committee and is expected to be the right-foot man
of Joseph Blatter, who on Monday was elected president of the
sport's international governing body FIFA. But France's national
team would struggle more than Platini.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to qualify in 1990, France was considered certain
to take part in 1994 in the United States. With two qualifying
matches remaining, both at home, it needed only to defeat
relatively weak Israel or draw with Bulgaria. But the French
proceeded to surrender a 2-1 lead against Israel in the final 10
minutes and lose. Against Bulgaria, the score was tied at 1 when,
with only seconds remaining, Bulgaria's Emil Kostadinov scored off
a counterattack. The next morning, the French newspaper
``Liberation'' ran the memorable headline: ''France Qualifies! For
1998!''
</P>
<P>
   As the home team, France was indeed guaranteed a spot, but its
new and enormously gifted generation of players, most of whom play
for clubs outside of the country, is certainly deserving. France's
fullbacks and midfielders are among the world's best. The problem
before this World Cup was up front, where France lacked a proven
striker. That missing element and Jacquet's inherently conservative
approach helped foster pessimism in recent months. But three goals
in 90 minutes should be enough to convert most skeptics into
believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me, they're the favorites,'' said South African
coach Philippe Troussier, who might be even more objective if he
weren't French. &QL;

U.S. KNEW CHINA MILITARY USED CIVILIAN SATELLITES, REPORTS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the past two years, China's military has relied
on American-made satellites sold for civilian purposes to transmit
messages to its far-flung army garrisons, according to highly
classified intelligence reports.
</P>
<P>
   The reports are the most powerful evidence to date that the
American government knew that China's army was taking advantage of
the Bush and Clinton administrations' decisions to encourage sales
of technology to Asian companies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has barred American companies from selling
military equipment to the Chinese military since the 1989 killings
in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence reports, which were described by administration
officials, were recounted last year in a document compiled by
Pentagon intelligence officials and sent to hundreds of senior
policy-makers at the White House, State Department and other
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressional committees are examining whether the
administration's policy toward technology exports damaged national
security by strengthening China. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said last week that
he plans to investigate use of American-made satellites by China's
military. The House recently voted to ban future satellite exports
to China and the Senate is scheduled to take up similar legislation
soon.
</P>
<P>
   China turned to the American-made satellites, which are owned by
Hong Kong companies with ties to the Chinese government, when its
own communications network collapsed and replacements built with
help from the German conglomerate Daimler-Benz were not working.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said it was impossible to prevent
China's army from using American-made satellites sold abroad, and
that their long-term aim was to prevent China's military from
obtaining the technology needed to make the equipment on its own.
In addition, they said, the arrangement had a side benefit: It gave
American intelligence agencies a better chance of intercepting
China's military communications.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said that if the United States
had barred American manufacturers from selling satellites in Asia,
the Chinese would have eventually gained access to satellites
produced in Europe or other countries that have fewer limits on
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument that we can block use of civilian satellite
technology by the Chinese military is simply unrealistic, given the
widespread availability of other satellite options around the
world,'' James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of the intelligence findings _ and the
administration's explanation of the information _ injects a new
element into the broadening congressional investigation of the
administration's policy on technology sales involving China.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has publicly justified its satellite
sales to Chinese-linked companies on grounds that they were being
used solely for civilian purposes. This argument was the
underpinning of Clinton's decision in March 1996 to shift
responsibility for satellite sales from the State Department to the
Commerce Department, which is charged with encouraging exports.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the intelligence reports were part
of a document called the Military Intelligence Digest, which was
distributed a few months before President Clinton approved the
latest sale of a commercial satellite to a civilian Chinese
government ministry in February. The document said China's army was
making extensive use of the American-made satellites to transmit
its coded messages, according to administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   The digest incorporates reports about military developments
around the world, and it is difficult to assess who read any item
and how closely, given the numerous intelligence memorandums
policy-makers receive.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the administration say that the export of American
satellites to companies with ties to the Chinese military has
enhanced China's military prowess, shoring up a crucial weakness in
the army's operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is weighing whether to allow another
Asian company with ties to the Chinese military to buy a similar
communications satellite.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that China's military has long made some
use of commercial satellites, including those launched by the
consortium known as Intelsat, of which the United States and China
are members. But officials said the army's use of American-made
satellites sharply increased in the past two years, just as
American aerospace manufacturers were placing greater emphasis on
their satellite sales to Asia and just as the Clinton
administration was easing export rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have made no secret of the improvements wrought by
increased access to the satellites.
</P>
<P>
   In an article last September, the daily newspaper published by
China's army said that officers once had ``cried themselves
hoarse'' or run to distant post offices to send urgent messages
over the military's antiquated communication system. ``Those
phenomena are now history,'' the article said, noting that
satellite communications had been used for such high-profile
operations as last year's handover of Hong Kong, the former British
colony.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Clinton approved the sale of a commercial
satellite made by Loral Space and Communications to a Chinese
government ministry. The memorandum to Clinton outlining pros and
cons of the deal made no mention of the recent intelligence about
the Chinese military's growing reliance on similar American
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   It did tell Clinton the administration could deflect possible
criticism of the sale by pointing out that it ``will not contribute
to Chinese military capabilities.'' A White House national security
official, who declined to be identified, said this was meant to
refer to the technology needed to launch the satellite, not the use
of the satellite.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Congressional committees are closely scrutinizing that sale,
which was approved by Clinton in the face of objections from
Justice Department prosecutors, who were investigating the company
for possible violations of export law. Loral's chairman, Bernard
Schwartz, was the largest individual donor to the Democratic Party
last year, and has given over $1 million in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the president defended his decision as ``pretty
routine.''
</P>
<P>
   All modern armies transmit their messages through satellites.
</P>
<P>
   China launched its first generation of communication satellites,
the DFH-2 series, in the 1980s. The last of those satellites
stopped working a few years ago. A second generation satellite, the
DFH-3, was launched in 1994, but failed to achieve proper orbit and
was not usable.
</P>
<P>
   China's military turned to American-made commercial satellites,
which had been sold in the early 1990s to Hong Kong companies with
ties to the Chinese government and military. Some of these exports
were approved by Bush, others by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   According to American officials, the main Hong Kong company used
by the Chinese military for its communication is APT, a public
company based in Hong Kong. Its shareholders include a unit of
Costind, the scientific and research arm of the Chinese army.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite was built by Hughes Space and Communications, part
of General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics subsidiary, and the
license for the sale was approved by the Clinton administration in
1995. Most of the technicians involved in operating the satellite
came from Chinese government agencies, including Costind.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Costind unit leased two receivers aboard the
satellite, called Apstar 1A, according to the prospectus APT issued
in late 1996 when it sold stock on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The prospectus said Costind was using the satellite to broadcast
news and entertainment programs to Macau. But administration
officials said that the Chinese military was using it for other
purposes, and was relaying coded communications to command and
control its forces.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Lo, APT's secretary, said in a telephone interview from
Hong Kong that his company was a ``commercial entity'' that leases
satellite time to ``broadcasters and telecommunications networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this could include the Chinese army, Lo replied that
the army ``has business enterprises.'' He declined to answer
whether this did include coded, military communications, saying the
question was ``too prejudiced.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald O'Neal, a spokesman for Hughes, said his company could
not control the use of its satellites and that it relied on the
American government to vet customers for any ties to the Chinese
army.
</P>
<P>
   The successful launching of Apstar 1A on a Chinese rocket in
July 1996 eased fears among Chinese officials about the country's
rocket program, according to reports in the press.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, China again tried to solve its satellite
difficulties with its own equipment. On May 12, 1997, a Chinese
rocket launched another DFH-3 telecommunications satellite into
orbit. It was built by China Aerospace Corp. and Daimler-Benz and
contained some American parts. But according to Roland Klein, a
Daimler-Benz spokesman, the satellite never worked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials insist it is impractical for
the government to require companies buying U.S. communications
satellites to certify that they will be used solely for civilian
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But some exporters already do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Chinese rocket put a Lockheed-Martin Corp.
satellite into orbit for a Chinese telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a certificate of end use from the Chinese government
saying the satellite would be used for commercial purposes only,''
said Jim Fetig, a spokesman for Lockheed-Martin.

   As more people can afford to join country clubs, ``you'll find
that this becomes a much more scrutinized industry,'' said James
Singerling, executive director of the Club Managers Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   And careful scrutiny is a member's best protection, said L.
Louis Mrachek, a lawyer with Gunster, Yoakley, Valdes-Fauli &AMP;
Stewart of Miami, which specializes in country club litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective members should study membership documents and the
club's bylaws and articles of incorporation, or ask someone they
trust to do so, Mrachek said. Only then, he said, can they fully
understand their rights. And once they become members, they should
monitor any bylaw amendments and act quickly if the change is
unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond bylaws, state contract law may require that bylaw changes
be ``reasonable'' and not alter the ``basic concept or scheme'' of
the club, Mrachek explained. But the only way to challenge such
changes may be to go to court, which can be risky if club bylaws
hold dissident members responsible for the club's legal fees,
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Member-owned clubs are not immune from dissent, said Terry A.
Taylor, Clubcorp's general counsel. ``In fact,'' Taylor said,
``given the factions that usually arise in member-owned clubs, I
would suspect that if the member is so inclined, he or she could
have more influence on operations at one of our clubs.'' &QL;

 &HT;    A blip in the Dow's dip
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Falling stock prices lured investors back into the
market on Friday, triggering a rally that wiped out what had been a
127-point loss for the Dow Jones industrial average. Still, the
buying isn't expected to continue, given the fundamental market
worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying on the dips has been a good strategy for individual
investors,'' Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist for Edward
Jones, said of the rally. ``We saw some bargain hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's turnaround gave the benchmark Dow its first gain in
four sessions but left it with a loss of almost 203 points for the
week.
</P>
<P>
   The late-session buying also boosted the secondary and broader
markets, which have declined even more than the blue chips since
the end of the first quarter. The Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000
indexes of technology and smaller stocks closed above their lows,
but with small loses for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Energy and energy-service sectors led the turnaround as oil
stocks rebounded from sharp selling earlier in the week. Technology
and blue chip stocks that have been under pressure also gained.
</P>
<P>
   Investors easily digested the government's report that producer,
or wholesale, prices rose only 0.2 percent in May, although it was
the second straight monthly gain.
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome was official news that Japan's economy _ second
only to the United States' _ has fallen into the second recession
in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is the key to an Asian recovery,'' said Skrainka. ``If
it deteriorates, the Asian region will remain under pressure. The
problems are serious and will not go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Skrainka contends that Asia's problems will not have a major
impact on the U.S. economy, since total U.S. trade represents only
about 12 percent of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts worry that Japan's reluctance to reform its
economy threatens to spread Asia's problems to other world markets,
and that would affect the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will find out Thursday how much worse the Asian impact
has become, when the United States releases its April trade
figures.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the trade deficit rose to a six-year high of $13
billion. A Bloomberg News survey of analysts looks for the April
deficit to increase to $13.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Deepening concern about Asia comes just ahead of the next round
of corporate profit reports. Companies that may have second-quarter
problems are expected to issue advance warnings over the next few
weeks, prior to the release of final reports in July.
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter corporate profits declined 2.2 percent
year-over-year, according to the Commerce Department. That followed
the 2.3 percent decline in fourth-quarter 1997 profits, for the
first instance of back-to-back profit declines since the 1990-92
recession.

 &HT;    Contain Yourself
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- If your idea of gardening is planting a couple of
nice-looking pots on the porch, give yourself a gold star. You've
become a true gardener.
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's a real science to designing and
assembling an attractive and effective container garden. Don't let
anyone tell you it's just potluck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like baking a cake,'' said Alison Dembo, assistant
retail manager for Habersham Gardens. Leave out a key ingredient or
forget a crucial step, and you risk a real flop.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never experimented with pots, consider what more and
more garden addicts are discovering: Containers allow you to create
a low-maintenance garden in a small space, to move the color of a
garden close to the house or into the shade, and to experiment with
a wide variety of plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're especially nice for people who live in the city,''
Dembo said.
</P>
<P>
   The planting options, including shrubs and even small trees, are
endless. ``Basically, any plant can be grown in a container if
you're willing to water, fertilize and acclimate the pot to a
location,'' Dembo said.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're willing to pay the price, you can create an
established garden from the get-go by packing it with mature
plants. ``The goal is to do something that looks pretty from the
beginning and will grow into something beautiful over the course of
the summer,'' said Sylvia Attkisson, an Atlanta garden designer.
</P>
<P>
   Before stirring up a pot, here are the main ingredients you'll
need:
</P>
<P>
   Proper container material. ``There are so many whimsical things
out now, you can use almost anything for a container,'' Dembo said,
from rustic troughs to old boots.
</P>
<P>
   Terra cotta, by far, is the most popular material. Because it's
porous, it can absorb water, maintaining moisture longer, and
assume the mossy look so popular today. For year-round containers,
avoid Mexican terra cotta, Dembo said, because it's prone to
cracking during freezes. French or Italian terra cotta, concrete,
fiberglass and plastic are wiser choices.
</P>
<P>
   Location, location, location. The amount of sun or shade in the
place where you plan to put the pot will determine your plant
choices.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of plants _ verticals, trailers and fillers. Also aim
for a mix of heights; leaf sizes, shapes and textures; and
complementary colors in blooms and foliage.
</P>
<P>
   For height, consider cannas; ornamental grasses; shrubs,
including roses; and small trees, such as cherry laurels and
Japanese magnolias. Edge the pot with trailing plants such as
verbena, petunias, lantana, plectranthus, ivy, variegated vinca or
trailing zinnia (Zinnia angustifolia). Then fill in with
medium-size plants _ penta, plumbago, caladiums, coleus, impatiens,
ferns, hostas, small roses, hydrangeas.
</P>
<P>
   Decoration. Accent the pot as you would a garden. Add an
ornament, such as metal sculpture, an obelisk or even a trellis for
growing clematis, roses or Carolina jessamine.
</P>
<P>
   You were planning to decorate that cake, weren't you?

 &HT;    Grand gardenia perfumes gardens and memories
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Gardenia. I love the sound of the word. Some lyricist
did too, as I recall, writing of a ``blue gardenia.'' Never have I
seen any but white ones. White, like the color of snow, like the
color of whiteouts and killer glaciers. Deathly, ghostly white. But
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   And sad, somehow. Why sad, I don't know for sure. I do think
that Billie Holiday is one reason. She, with her gardenia behind
her ear, she of the sadly beautiful songs _ ``... ain't nobody's
business if I do ... strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
... lover man, where can you beeeeee ...'' _ she of the tragic
life, she has to be one of the reasons the gardenia for some evokes
tragedy, she of the wasted death.
</P>
<P>
   Death, yes, that sweetness associated with funeral flowers. That
makes some dislike _ fear? _ gardenia. These are those who have sat
too many times without air conditioning in country churches,
fanning themselves during hot afternoon funerals, listening to the
haunting songs _ ``... swing low, sweet chariot ...'' _ staring at
the casket up front seemingly afloat in sweet lilies and tuberoses
and ... gardenias.
</P>
<P>
   I have sat in too many of those churches, but I am not in that
number. I still love the flower. Always have. Always will.
</P>
<P>
   And now that the gardenia is in its high bloom season, I am in
high cotton, enjoying its fragrance as it transports me back, back
in time to sweet, hot Southern nights when the flower perfumed the
air of Meridian, Miss., and infused my youth with its richness.
Enjoying its fragrance takes me forward, too, forward to the time
when my small gardenia bushes, scattered around my gardens in
Atlanta and McCaysville, will reach the enviable heights that I see
in so many older spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Even with my smallish bushes, I coax enough blooms to keep one
in the house throughout the season. My best producer is one I
brought inside for the winter, one that now blooms more than all
the rest combined. Together, my several gardenias may have a
half-dozen blossoms at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   But how many do you need? Just one of these lovelies lights a
home _ even after it begins to brown and dry. If I have just two
blooms, one comes inside.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Wallace, friend and neighbor, understands. Sitting in her
garden the other day, her gardenia showing off with more than a
dozen perfect blossoms, we talked about our love for this sweet
thing.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the gardenia is a metaphor for the garden that Kay
is lovingly building. A frequent traveler, she lingers at her
gardenia on each return. And while away, she telephones her sister,
Alexis Barrett, to ask about its condition. ``She gives me the blow
by blow. She'll say, `You've got lots of buds.'''
</P>
<P>
   That sustains Kay until she returns to see and smell and touch
and cut.
</P>
<P>
   Her gardenia love began in childhood back in her native
Tuscaloosa, Ala., where she recalls smelling the blossoms in the
gardens of older women.
</P>
<P>
   She loves gardenia more now than yesteryear, associating them
with Billie, of course, ``and with anticipation,'' noting the
pregnant elegance of the about-to-open bud, white, tinged with
green, noting too that it recalls ``a past that we won't ever have
again.''
</P>
<P>
   What else, I ask, does this flower mean? What does it evoke?
</P>
<P>
   ``That you can write about?'' she said, meaningfully.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't nobody's business ...

 &HT;    Earnhardt, McReynolds: no chemistry
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ ``We could have let the truck driver set it up
at Richmond and not made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words, Larry McReynolds put into perspective what
went wrong with his tenure as crew chief for driver Dale Earnhardt.
It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   When the Winston Cup garage opened Friday morning at Michigan
Speedway, McReynolds was guiding operations for Mike Skinner and
Kevin Hamlin was heading Earnhardt's efforts, a crew chief switch
made earlier in the week by owner Richard Childress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looks for that elusive chemistry,'' McReynolds said.
``We didn't have it. After the (Daytona) 500, for both teams, it's
been like an avalanche we haven't been able to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds admits that one of his problems may have been forcing
too much information on Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so intense that during qualifying I would go stand down in
the first corner and radio Dale that `we're off (in speed) because
we're not on gas here.' The feeling I got was I'm not sure he
wanted to know what I was telling him.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. deal
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr. was assured job security for the next five
years Friday when he agreed to a long-term deal with Dale Earnhardt
Incorporated, with options for five additional years. The younger
Earnhardt plans to continue in NASCAR's Busch series for the
remainder of the '98 season and as well as the entire '99 campaign.
``It feels good to finally have a formal contract signed with Dale
Jr.,'' said Earnhardt Sr. ``But our blood contract has been good
for 23 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerhardt on pole:
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Gerhardt won the pole Friday for today's ARCA 200 with a
single lap time of 180.768 miles per hour. Second fastest was Gary
Laton at 178.191. One of Gerhardt's sponsors is the Knight Ridder
newspaper chain.

 &HT;    Weather change puts Ward Burton on pole
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ It was payback time for Ward Burton Friday as
he won the pole for Sunday's Miller Lite 400 at Michigan Speedway
with a speed of 181.561 miles per hour, his second pole of the year
and fourth of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Burton was the 20th car out, catching a sudden cloud cover that
cooled the track and enhanced his time of 39.656 seconds. Earlier
this year, in qualifying for the Coca-Cola 600, he seemed a lock to
win the pole, but a sudden burst of sun broke through the clouds,
denying him that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win some, lose some,'' said Burton, who became the 13th
different pole-winner in the 13 NASCAR Winston Cup races at
Michigan since June 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, in his Ford Taurus, joins Burton on the front row,
running 181.210 mph in 39.733 seconds. Rusty Wallace, 181.082, was
third, and Jeff Gordon fourth at 180.918 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Pontiacs are good, and the guys are doing a good job of
adjusting them for me,'' Burton said. ``But the biggest difference
is what's under the hood. We were really good in the 600 and didn't
get to show it at the end. We were probably a 15th-place car there
(instead, winding up 34th). It's time we get it turned back
around.''
</P>
<P>
   It was pretty much another Ford show, with nine qualifying in
the top 15. The Chevy teams placed five, and Burton's was the lone
Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that's over,'' Gordon said. ``We were so off all day.
We weren't hiding anything. We were just flat-out struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   In somewhat of a turnaround, Dale Earnhardt, who was next to
last in the final practice session, came back to take the 25th
spot, his first in the top 25 since Talladega nearly two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I made it the first day (of qualifying),'' Earnhardt
said. ``We've fought this for race after race. I know 25th isn't
first, but it's a hell of an improvement from 43rd. Getting in the
first day makes a big difference. Now, we can come out here
Saturday and concentrate on getting our car ready to go race.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen others are in danger. John Andretti wrecked his car in
practice; Todd Bodine, Kyle Petty, Dave Marcis, Morgan Shepherd and
Chad Little are looking at provisionals.

 &HT;    Busy offseason lies ahead for Jordan
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -- Whether his basketball career ends with the
conclusion of the NBA Finals or the coming months bring a
well-deserved vacation, Michael Jordan has plenty of offseason
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's love for golf is well-known, and an offhand remark in a
magazine garnered him an exemption to play in this year's Illinois
Open, Aug. 6-8 in nearby Aurora. Jordan has not responded to the
Illinois Professional Golf Association yet.
</P>
<P>
   IPGA executive director Mike Miller said: ``Our contact with
Michael was the result of a Golf Digest article in which he said
after he retired he had an interest in competitive golf. He
mentioned the Illinois Open. Based on that, we sent a letter to him
offering an exemption. I'm anticipating a yes or no after the NBA
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also learned that Jordan and wife Juanita have leased a
palatial home in Vancouver for the month of July. The luxury home
rents for $25,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   West Vancouver Mayor Pat Boname said the family could expect the
people there to be ``not only friendly, but less intrusive'' than
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would respect his privacy,'' she said. ``We would just be
grateful that he is here and say, `Have a good time and we'll see
you around.'''
</P>
<P>
   Riding the wave
</P>
<P>
   Many players have ridden on Jordan's and Scottie Pippen's
coattails to NBA championship rings. Many of them were present
during this year's NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey King, an underachieving big man, was one of them. King is
thankful for the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty percent of me wishes I could have gone to a team where
I could have played 40 minutes a game and scored a lot of points,
but taken my lumps,'' said King, who played in Turkey this year.
``It's a tradeoff. With the Bulls, I was just a piece of a puzzle.
Eighty percent of me, though, wouldn't trade those three
championships for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl denies report
</P>
<P>
   Former Seattle coach George Karl denied a report in the Chicago
Tribune this week that he was on the Bulls' list of candidates to
replace Phil Jackson, who is not expected to be re-signed after the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Karl said he has not been contacted by Bulls general manager
Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't talk to any team that already has a coach,'' Karl
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Karl said he probably would not coach at all next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a betting man, I'd bet that I sit out.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing with Rodman
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz's Jeff Hornacek said he'd take the wild Dennis Rodman
as a teammate anytime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys sometimes, when they go to set a pick, they put their
hands inside of them and stand up straight and don't really set a
good pick,'' Hornacek said. ``But Dennis does, and it opens things
up. You need guys like that to make a team go. I'd take him in a
heartbeat.''

 &HT;    Veteran band takes care of details (4HIM, ``Obvious'')
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The pleasures of 4HIM's ``Obvious'' are indeed
obvious. There are rich vocal harmonies and hook-laden songs, but
they shouldn't be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Much of contemporary Christian music has been taken over by a
youth movement, post-adolescent musicians who favor hyper-driven
tunes that yield more energy than actual musical skill.
</P>
<P>
   That's why ``Obvious'' is so refreshing. This veteran Christian
band takes care of the small details: well-written songs and smooth
harmonizing that makes a listener want to hum along. The approach
has netted the Daphne, Ala.-based group 21 No. 1 songs on Christian
radio, six Dove Awards and a Grammy Award nomination.
</P>
<P>
   4HIM is known for its blend of voices. The group combines the
vocal stylings of '70s supergroups such as Ambrosia and Chicago.
Those influences are obvious on songs such as the uptempo ``Voice
In The Wilderness'' and the bouncy ``Can't Get Past the Evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The album's music is a perfect complement to 4HIM's harmonizing.
The group has abandoned the ``wall of sound'' approach used on its
previous album for a more sparse, organic sound on ``Obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   The new style works. From the shimmering acoustic guitar opening
of ``Let the Lion Run Free'' to the muscular drumming throughout,
the sound of ``Obvious'' is sparkling, full of clever hooks and
tasteful musical touches.
</P>
<P>
   Another strong suit for ``Obvious'' is its variety. Most of the
songs are straight-ahead pop/rock, but on ``Who's at the Wheel,''
4HIM employs an urban R&AMP;B approach that works surprisingly well.

 &HT;    Thrashers' GM search winds down
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- As the Stanley Cup finals wind down, so does the
Atlanta Thrashers' search for a general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL expansion team might select its general manager as early
as next week, and the job is expected to be filled by one of four
candidates: NHL director of operations Brian Burke, Detroit
assistant general manager Don Waddell, hockey agent Mike Gillis or
Dallas assistant general manager Les Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Gillis, 39, was interviewed by Thrashers president Harvey
Schiller recently and is considered one of the hot candidates in
NHL circles. He also is a candidate for the GM vacancy in
Vancouver, which contacted him during the all-star break.
</P>
<P>
   Gillis, who is based in Kingston, Ontario, declined to comment
on his candidacy or whether he is seeking any job.
</P>
<P>
   A former player with Boston and Colorado, Gillis is the only one
of the GM prospects with no management experience. But teams hiring
agents for the front office has become a league trend. The best
example is Pierre Lacroix, who made the transition from a player
representative to a management role with the Quebec Nordiques
before the franchise was moved to Colorado. Gillis, who attended
law school in Ontario, has about 20 NHL clients, including Canucks
star forward Pavel Bure.
</P>
<P>
   Burke also is a possibility in Vancouver. He is the only
Thrasher candidate with general manager experience.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller and Thrashers vice president Dave Maggard, who have
acknowledged publicly only that Burke is a candidate, plan to
attend Games 3 and 4 of the Cup finals in Washington.

 &HT;    Rains, wildflowers _ and butterflies
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The recent rains have revived wildflowers, which in
turn have perked up butterflies. ``We've definitely got more
butterflies since the last big rain a week or so ago,'' says
naturalist Jerry Payne, who lives in Musella near Macon. Native
verbenas, buttonbush, butterfly weed and other wildflower favorites
of butterflies are sporting their blooms now. ``All the butterflies
that are supposed to be here this time of year are here,'' says
Payne. ``We're seeing lots of tiger swallowtails (Georgia's state
butterfly), buckeyes, pearl crescents, American painted ladies, red
spotted purples, red admirals and a few monarchs; and we're
beginning to get the skippers common for this time of year, such as
cloudy wings and whirlabouts.''
</P>
<P>
   FIELD NOTES: The color white dominates the blooms at the
Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area right now, says
naturalist Jerry Hightower. Sporting white flowers are Southern
magnolias, silky dogwoods, Virginia willows, yucca, New Jersey tea
and elder-
</P>
<P>
   berry. However, yellow-flowered loosestrife, purple-flowered
curly milkweed and the brilliant orange-flowered butterfly weed are
adding dashes of color to the park.
</P>
<P>
   Many turtle species also are moving about, Hightower says.
During the past week, he has saved several box turtles and some
snapping turtles, painted turtles and musk turtles from being run
over by cars on streets in or near the park. Remember, if you
rescue a road-crossing turtle, always place it to the side to which
it was headed. If you place it on the side from which it crawled,
it will simply try to cross the road again. Also, be extremely
careful around snapping turtles. They can stretch their necks
longer than you think, and they can bite with bone-crunching power.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southern Nantahala Wilderness Area in mountainous Towns
and Rabun counties along the Georgia-North Carolina border,
naturalist Glenn Barnett says the blooms of purplish-flowered
spiderwort, fire pink and fawn's breath (aptly named because of its
soft, delicate, off-white flowers) are impressive now. Sheep
laurel, a miniature mountain laurel that also has clusters of
pinkish, cup-shaped flowers, is blooming in sunny, rocky, open
areas on ridgetops. Also at high elevations, Carolina rhododendron
is in flower. ``And there are larger-than-usual colonies this year
of my favorite wild edible, the Indian cucumber root,'' which has a
cucumberlike taste, says Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also seeing lots of insect galls on trees and other
plants.'' The galls, which resemble cancerlike growths, are caused
by tiny wasps or other insects, whose larvae live in the galls and
later bore their way out and feed on the plants.
</P>
<P>
   BEAR NOTES: Want to know more about Georgia's black bears? Then
go to Brasstown Bald _ at 4,784 feet Georgia's highest peak _ on
June 20, 11 a.m.-4 p.m. The Chattahoochee/
</P>
<P>
   Oconee Heritage Association, a nonprofit group that works with
the Forest Service to help visitors enjoy Georgia's national
forests, is holding its first Black Bear Day. Experts will be there
to provide information and answer questions about the bears. For
more information: 706-896-3471.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE SKY: The moon will be at last-quarter phase on Wednesday
evening, rising out of the east about midnight, says Fernbank
Science Center astronomer David Dundee. Jupiter rises out of the
east four hours before sunrise; it can be seen near the moon
Wednesday evening. Saturn comes up in the east three hours before
sunrise and appears near the moon on Friday morning. Venus also is
in the east, rising just before sunrise.

 &HT;    King family to meet with Clinton on MLK slaying
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Coretta Scott King and three of her children will
meet with President Clinton next week, as the slain civil rights
leader's family presses for a federal investigation into King's
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Citing new evidence in the 30-year-old case, Mrs. King called
for the investigation in April and requested the meeting with
Clinton. The White House confirmed Tuesday's meeting and said
Clinton is glad to talk with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the president will give serious consideration to
our request for a federal panel to examine all the evidence
surrounding the death of my husband,'' Mrs. King said in a
statement Friday. ``The majority of Americans want to know the
truth behind the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. I firmly
believe that this can best be done through the appointment of a
federal commission composed of individuals of unassailable
character and integrity. I feel this is the only way we can achieve
a sense of closure, not only for my family, but for the entire
nation and move forward to fulfill Martin's dream of a nation
united in justice and brotherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The national panel that King's widow envisions would be
patterned after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South
Africa, which is holding hearings on racial atrocities during the
apartheid era and offers immunity to participants who give honest
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Mrs. King will be Martin Luther King III, Dexter
Scott King and the Rev. Bernice King.
</P>
<P>
   James Earl Ray, who died in April at age 70, pleaded guilty in
1969 to the April 4, 1968, assassination but recanted within days.

   Caps lean on big guy &QL; 
to pull them through
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig fills net so that Red Wings won't
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ To say that Olaf Kolzig has come up big in goal for
the Washington Capitals during the Stanley Cup playoffs might be
redundant.
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig
</P>
<P>
   But even though Kolzig stands 6-3 and weighs 235 pounds _ a
behemoth compared to the average NHL goaltender _ he's going to
have to come up even bigger if the Caps intend to make a series of
the Stanley Cup finals against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig has been the linchpin throughout the Capitals' first-ever
run to the finals. Despite making 55 saves in a 5-4 overtime loss
to Detroit on Thursday night, Kolzig allowed four goals in the
final 28 minutes, 47 seconds of the third period and overtime.

   The Red Wings bounced back from 3-1 and 4-2 deficits in the
third period and won in overtime to take a commanding 2-0 lead in
the best-of-seven series. Detroit appears poised for its second
straight Stanley Cup sweep as the series resumes tonight at MCI
Center. The biggest question Friday for the Caps was whether the
disheartening loss will bother them in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no choice but to come back,'' said Kolzig, who had not
allowed more than four goals in any of the Caps' previous 18
playoff games before Thursday. ``We could sit here and sulk, and it
would be a quicker series than what we had planned it to be. But we
have to learn from what we did and get back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of offense. We've got to respect their
ability but not respect them. I think we gave them a little too
much respect. We had our foot on the head of the snake. We let it
up, and it bit us.''
</P>
<P>
   In no way was Kolzig solely to blame for the Caps' collapse in
Game 2. On most nights, 55 saves should get the job done. The
Washington defense corps, which wearied as the game grew longer,
left Kolzig on his own time after time in the third period and
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was making some great saves,'' Capitals coach Ron Wilson
said. ``I think our defense looked like it was tired. Olie was
fine. You couldn't fault him for any of them (goals by Detroit).''
</P>
<P>
   As was the case Thursday, it's obvious the Caps would not have
come this far into the playoffs without Kolzig. He has been the
best goal-tender the last two months, a surprising development
considering Kolzig started the season as the backup to Bill
Ranford.
</P>
<P>
   But Ranford suffered a groin injury in the first game of the
season, and Kolzig's vast potential finally kicked in. In 64
regular-season games, Kolzig was 33-18-10 with a 2.20 goals-against
average. Before this year, the 28-year-old Kolzig had been a career
minor-leaguer and backup whose legendary temper had held him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first couple years of my career, I wasn't tough
mentally, and I had to work on that,'' Kolzig said. ``I used to
break sticks or threaten guys if they shot too high or threaten
them if they came near me in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was given the opportunity before, I fell flat on my
face. When I got it this year, I wanted to make sure I took
advantage of it. I had been labeled a career backup goaltender, and
I didn't know if I'd get many more chances to become a No. 1 guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig's background might begin to explain why he is a
self-described late bloomer. He was born in Johannesburg, South
Africa, to German parents and never was able to put down roots
throughout his childhood. His father worked for an international
hotel chain and was transferred throughout the world as Olaf was
growing up. Ask Kolzig where he has lived, and his answer is:
``Where haven't I lived? That would probably be easier.''
</P>
<P>
   His father was transferred to Canada when Kolzig was in grammar
school, and that's when Olaf started playing hockey. After a
successful junior hockey career in Western Canada, Kolzig was the
Caps' No. 1 pick in the 1989 draft.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until nearly 10 years later that Kolzig was able
to put everything together. Taming his emotions was the key, since
his goaltending ability has always been rated above average. His
bulk makes it hard for shooters to find an open target up high, but
Kolzig also can handle low shots as well as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olie has a ton of talent,'' Wilson said. ``He's very athletic.
He's huge, and he's got the style that I really like in a goalie.
He's a classic butterfly goaltender. He makes himself big in the
net.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig does not try to downplay his size. He seems to relish the
``Godzilla'' nickname that was hung on him when he played in the
minors and would lose his temper and thrash around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty aggressive,'' Kolzig said. ``I'm pretty big and
would play with a lot of fire. So they gave me the nickname
Godzilla, and it just stuck. With my equipment on and with the way
I play, I fill the net pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that intimidates shooters to maybe not shoot, instead to
look for the perfect pass. If that happens, I've already won the
psychological battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest battle facing Kolzig and the Caps tonight is to post
the franchise's first Stanley Cup finals victory and take some of
the gathering momentum away from the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Since the best-of-seven format was introduced in 1939, only
three teams have won the Stanley Cup after trailing 2-0. The last
time it happened was 1971, when Montreal beat Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll bounce back at home,'' Wilson said. ``If it takes four
tries to win a game here in Detroit, we'll get one. We lost two
games, both of them by one goal, one of them in overtime. I don't
feel like we're out of this.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ From the shade of his porch across the street,
Grover Thomas could watch the steady stream of people, black and
white, bearing casseroles and baked chicken and other peace
offerings Friday to the family of James Byrd Jr., who was killed
last week in one of the South's most grotesque racial murders in
many years.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere in his 81-year-old imagination, Thomas _ known as
Pete in the quietly disheveled, mostly black neighborhood of East
Jasper _ still held out hope that Byrd would somehow walk up to his
porch, as he did every morning, with a friendly word and a few
sausages or a cardboard box of dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he didn't come over Sunday, I knew that he was gone, not
coming back,'' Thomas, a retired sawmill hand, said as a rooster
strutted about the dirt lawn and an old dog scratched. ``He had cut
my lawn the day before, and he was supposed to take me to church.
He had his problems, but he never forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   James Byrd never seemed to have made full use of a broad
intelligence and a renowned musical ability, relatives and
neighbors said Thursday. But those who knew him described something
solid within him, a reliability that drove him to take care of
Thomas, an elderly neighbor he had known since boyhood, and a deep
affection for three children of his failed marriage.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his personal problems _ alcoholism, petty thievery,
an inability to hold a job _ he was well-liked and had apparently
never been involved in any kind of racial incident.
</P>
<P>
   Family members, gathered from across Texas for the funeral
Saturday, said they cannot fathom the kind of random racial hatred
that authorities say led three white men to drag him by his ankles
from a pickup truck early Sunday morning, tearing his body to
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told the children that this was just an isolated act of
people who were sick and twisted,'' said Clara Taylor, one of
Byrd's sisters, standing on the front lawn of the brown wooden
house where they both grew up and where Byrd's mother and father
still live. ``To do this, you have to believe that someone is just
not worth living to begin with. It had nothing to do with him. It
could have been anyone walking down the street. If they were black,
that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's high school class of 1967 was the last segregated class
in this southeast Texas town of 8,000, but even before full
integration began, neither Byrd nor most other residents had any
significant run-ins with white residents, neighbors and relatives
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd often sold vacuum cleaners to make money, said another
sister, Mary Verrett, and had success with both white and black
customers. He would often be seen walking the streets of town,
accepting rides from friends or acquaintances, and never with any
consequences, until this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of racial problems we had here were the kinds of
things where you wouldn't get the promotion or the right jobs,''
said Mrs. Verrett. ``In all the time I grew up, there was never any
outright bigotry, and none of us were afraid to walk the street. In
fact, you could say we were pretty happy.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Byrd, who was 49, was the third of eight children of Stella
Byrd, a Sunday school teacher, and James Byrd Sr., a dry cleaner.
The family's life revolved around the Greater New Bethel Baptist
Church, a few blocks away from their home, where Mrs. Byrd taught
and her husband was a deacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the church doors opened on Sunday, we were there,'' said
Mrs. Taylor, 50, who teaches eighth-grade science in the Houston
public schools. ``There was school in the morning, then services,
then Baptist Training Unit, then church again at night. You knew
what you'd be doing on Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Byrd was known in church more for the passion of his
piano playing and singing than his faith. He could pick out any
tune on the keyboard before he was 10, and was particularly adept
at belting out spirituals and hymns, especially ``Walk With Me,
Lord,'' and more recently the pop hit ``I Believe I Can Fly.'' He
was the lead trumpeter in the band at Rowe Elementary School, and
also did a more-than-passable imitation of Al Green.
</P>
<P>
   But despite an excellent academic record at Jasper High School,
he decided not to follow his two sisters into college, even though
he was encouraged to do so by his parents. His friends and
relatives speak vaguely and sadly of an aimless, drifting element
to his life, an unwillingness to commit himself to a career or a
passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so very intelligent, and as his family we always
regretted that he never used his intellectual potential to the
highest capacity,'' said Mrs. Verrett, 47, a medical
transcriptionist who lives in Houston. ``He wasn't the type of
person who liked a 9-to-5 job. He would get in a rut, and then his
personal difficulties would begin.''
</P>
<P>
   The drinking started in high school, friends say, and was
exacerbated by medical problems such as arthritis. (He had also
injured his foot in a bicycle accident in his youth, leading to his
neighborhood nickname of ``Toe.'') At some point, said the Rev.
Kenneth O. Lyons, pastor of Greater New Bethel and a boyhood
friend, Byrd lost his religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to remind him that he was brought up in a Christian
home, and that one day something like this could happen, and he
would need an eternal life,'' Lyons said Friday, after a condolence
call on the family. ``But James, he would challenge me. He would
say, if he came, he would have to be right, completely right, and
he would have to be sincere. I would say, no one's perfect, James.
And he would just look at me with that old look of his.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was married a few years out of high school and stayed with
his wife, on and off, for about 23 years, fathering three children:
Renee Mullins, 27, who until recently served in the Army; Ross, 20,
an Army private stationed at Fort. Benning, Ga., who is scheduled
to serve in South Korea in a few months; and Jamie, 16, who lives
with her mother in Lufkin, Texas, about 50 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage broke up in 1993, three years after Byrd was
convicted of theft and sentenced to seven years in prison. He was
paroled a few years later but sent back to prison for a violation,
returning to Jasper in 1996. At that point, things seemed to begin
to improve. Byrd entered Alcoholics Anonymous and began coming back
to the church, Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Using his disability money, Byrd got his own one-bedroom
apartment in a housing project in Jasper, and his sisters came over
to help decorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me not to sit on the roll-away bed, because his son
was coming to see him and would be sleeping there,'' said Mrs.
Verrett, who had recently bought him a dinette set she was planning
to give him. ``He was so proud of his children and wanted to
protect them. He always told his daughters it was a jungle out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But he never seemed to view his hometown that way. Many people
in Jasper who didn't know Byrd _ hundreds of whom were wearing
yellow ribbons on their shirts Thursday _ remembered seeing him
meander through town, never putting together enough disability
money to buy a used car, perfectly happy to walk if a friend didn't
pass by offering a ride.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows why he got in that pickup truck on Sunday while
walking home from a friend's house, although police have put
forward the theory that he knew one of the three men accused of the
crime because they had the same parole officer.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hours earlier, Byrd had stopped by to cut Thomas'
lawn and see two of his children at a bridal shower for a niece at
his parents' house. It was the last time he was seen by anyone who
loved him, the last time the neighborhood was intact. &QL;

JASPER ATTORNEYS PORTRAY MURDER SUSPECTS AS SHOCKED, REMORSEFUL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
and T.J. MILLING 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ One of the suspects denies he had any role in
last weekend's slaying of a black man and a second suspect is
remorseful and ``not a member of any racial hate group,'' attorneys
for two of the three white men accused in the racially charged
crime said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He denies any involvement,'' Jasper attorney Randy Walker said
of John William ``Bill'' King, 23, of Jasper. King denies even
being in the pickup that investigators said was used to drag James
Byrd Jr., 49, for almost three miles up and down a back country
road east of Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks it's horrible,'' Walker said his client said of the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was one of three local attorneys appointed by a judge
Friday to represent King and his co-defendants Shawn Berry, 23, of
Jasper and Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 31 of Sulphur Springs.
Charged with murder, all three have previously served prison
sentences for burglary and other non-violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal authorities consider the slaying of Byrd Jr.,
49, a racial ``hate crime.'' Byrd was beaten and chained by the
ankles to a pickup and dragged over a blacktopped road, ripping his
right arm and his head from his mangled body.
</P>
<P>
   State prison officials say that King and Brewer were monitored
for possible affiliation with extremist white groups while serving
sentences in the Beto I unit at Tennessee Colony in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's lawyer, meanwhile, portrayed his client as a remorseful
young man in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was Berry who
was first arrested in the Byrd slaying because Berry's pickup was
used.
</P>
<P>
   He has given a detailed statement to investigators, saying it
was King, a former high school classmate and prison buddy, who
drove the pickup pulling Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client is not a member of any racial hate group,'' said
attorney Steve Hollis. ``He doesn't have any sort of hatred for
black people ... The Shawn Berry you think you know as a racist, as
a member of the Aryan Brotherhood or the Klan doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's shaken up. He's sad. He's remorseful. He's confused. Take
your pick. He's all of those things,'' Hollis said. ``Whatever
happened out there that night, he's been able to reflect on ...
He's had time to reflect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Morian Jr., appointed to represent Russell Brewer Jr.,
refused to discuss details of the case.
</P>
<P>
   He described Brewer as quiet, shy and ``very shocked'' when he
learned of the worldwide media attention Byrd's slaying has
received. Like the other two defendants, Brewer was being kept
alone in an isolation cell Friday, Morian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very scared man in the Jasper County jail and he's
aware of all the media attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The three Jasper attorneys expect to be replaced if their
clients' charges of murder are upgraded to capital murder, which
could mean the death penalty upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Although at least two of them have handled previous capital
cases, they are not currently certified to handle those cases now.
Certification requires additional courses.
</P>
<P>
   Hollis said he met briefly with the district attorney Thursday
but did not discuss a plea bargain for Berry, the only suspect
cooperating with authorities. He said he wants the case to stay in
state district court, but ``my gut on it is it'll go federal.''
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal officials are trying to determine whether the
case can be handled as one of federal civil rights violations in
connection with a hate crime, so that the federal death penalty
could be sought.
</P>
<P>
   Berry has had no contact with his co-defendants in jail,
according to Hollis. He said King was Berry's ``old friend from the
pen'' and that Brewer was ``just a bum who showed up on the
porch.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim was an acquaintance of Berry's from around town and
the suspect had talked to him before, Hollis said. He said Berry
sincerely meant to help Byrd when he stopped to give him a ride
early Sunday, but he was intimidated by Brewer and King.
</P>
<P>
   Hollis, 34, is a graduate of the Texas Tech University law
school and has practiced law since November 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other lawyers, Hollis is a Jasper native. He has been
defense counsel in one capital murder case, although prosecutors
sought life in prison rather than the death penalty. Hollis said
his client was convicted and sentenced to a lengthy term in state
prison.
</P>
<P>
   He also was lead counsel in a non-capital murder case, which
ended in conviction for his client.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, King's attorney, is a former assistant county attorney
in Montgomery and Travis counties who has practiced general law in
Jasper since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, he has defended two accused capital murderers.
One case ended in a plea bargain; the other in a conviction and
death sentence. The second case was retried on appeal and ended in
a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is a graduate of the University of Texas law school and
also holds a degree in business administration from Louisiana State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's attorney, Morian, 30, has practiced law in Jasper with
the firm of Seale, Stover, Coffield &AMP; Bisbey since obtaining his
law license in November 1991. He is a graduate of the University of
Tulsa law school.

GIULIANI'S $15.1 MILLION `EMERGENCY CONTROL CENTER' 
</HEADLINE>

 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having tamed squeegee men and cabbies, murderers and
muggers, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is now bracing for a whole other
order of urban treachery and cataclysm by building a $15.1 million
emergency control center for his administration _ bullet-proofed,
hardened to withstand bombs and hurricanes, and equipped with food
and beds for at least 30 members of his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious project, which will sprawl over 46,000 feet in one
of the smaller buildings of the World Trade Center complex, will be
large enough to accommodate at least 50 different city, state and
federal agencies, and will allow them to coordinate responses to a
myriad of disasters, from the smallest sewer explosion to the
largest nerve gas attack.
</P>
<P>
   Among its amenities will be back-up generators in case of power
failures, a storage tank with enough water to last at least a week,
and whiz-bang technology that will include a secure ``red'' phone
for the mayor and video-conferencing, so he can see and talk to the
president of the United States, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the facility is ``not a bunker'' meant as a safety
haven for the mayor, Jerome Hauer, head of the city's Office of
Emergency Management, noted that New York City's emergency response
system had become a model for other cities and said that the
planned center was a natural next step in keeping that lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something the city has needed for a long time, a
state-of-the-art center with a sophisticated communications system,
that is survivable so the city can continue to function,'' he said.
``If there is a citywide blackout, a hurricane, a blizzard, this is
the facility that will allow us to keep working, to make sure that
people are not in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the news of the center's construction troubled many in city
government, especially City Council members, who were not notified
of the project. Some noted that the existing command center on the
eighth floor of police headquarters has functioned admirably during
a variety of storms, blackouts and terrorist attacks. Councilwoman
Kathryn Freed, whose district will house the new center, also
questioned whether the investment was fiscally prudent at a time
when the mayor has threatened to cut funding for senior citizens
centers, city hospitals and services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when the mayor is screaming and yelling about pork
in city government and trying to cut city services that keep
libraries and day care centers open, it seems bizarre to me that
the city would be putting nearly $16 million into a rented space
that the city doesn't even own,'' Ms. Freed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a $16 million improvement to another guy's building?''
she said. ``I sure hope this is a 99-year lease.''

READYING THE SLINGSHOT FOR A MODERN GOLIATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)  (bl) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Boies is the former Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore superstar
tral lawyer in the cheap suits and stretch limousines who has
defended some of the biggest legal game of the last 30 years: IBM
in its 13-year fight with the government, CBS in the libel suit
brought by Gen. William Westmoreland, and the nation's failed
savings-and-loans against Michael Milken.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is the government's chief lawyer in the snazziest
antitrust lawsuit of the 1990s: United States vs. Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Tough case? ``Not really,'' he said. ``To be honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies (pronounced BOYZ) has been called an eccentric genius, a
prima donna, wry and amusing _ but never modest. He said in an
interview on Wednesday that the Microsoft case would be over by
October (the trial is set to start Sept. 8 in Washington), and that
he was pleased with the judge's decision Tuesday to limit each side
to six to 12 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the government's best evidence against Microsoft
was Microsoft's own documents, used in the government's complaint.
``We didn't sort of hold back the best,'' Boies said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft responded to Boies' maneuverings with its own.
``That's useful information for us,'' William Neukom, Microsoft's
senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, said about the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said Thursday that the
Justice Department was deliberately withholding the documents it
was using against Microsoft to ``hamstring'' the defense. And so
forth.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the case is this: The government says Microsoft
used its monopoly in its Windows software to illegally crush
competitors in another market _ Internet browsers _ in favor of
Microsoft's own browser, called Internet Explorer. Microsoft
counters that Internet Explorer is an ``integrated product'' with
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Things were sunnier three days ago, when Boies talked in the
study of his very large red-brick house on 10 acres in Armonk,
N.Y., north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   There was a pool, a tennis court, a few dogs, the noises of
children (Boies has six from three wives). It might have been a
pleasant scene from the life of a country squire, were this country
squire not distracted by five phone lines and clients like actor
Garry Shandling, who is suing his manager in what is Boies' most
time-consuming case right now.
</P>
<P>
   Boies, 57, had the body language of a harried man who was just
passing through his home en route from Washington to the office in
Armonk. But he sat still for an hour, in black sneakers and a $160
suit from Macy's, and dismissed the idea that as a onetime IBM
lawyer against the government he can now bring tricks to the
government side.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be sure you don't fight the last war,'' Boies
said. Naturally, he said that he was on the right side both times,
and that ``IBM did not engage in the kind of practices'' that
Microsoft did.
</P>
<P>
   His main lesson from IBM?
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed,'' he said. It took the IBM case five years to get to
trial; eight years after that the Justice Department dropped the
case because it was technologically irrelevant. In May, Boies
pushed for the early Microsoft trial date.
</P>
<P>
   He grew most engaged when he talked about the Sherman Act, the
1890 law passed to control the robber barons, being used against
Microsoft. ``You're applying antitrust principles to software,''
Boies said. ``It's interesting, and it's important. But it's not
that difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees a re-emergence of antitrust enforcement in the 1990s,
after a trough during the Reagan administration, and says antitrust
laws ``are what make free markets possible.''
</P>
<P>
   It is probably impolite to point out that Boies has grown rich
from the antitrust laws _ he was making about $2 million a year
when he left Cravath in 1997 _ especially since he is charging the
Justice Department a bargain-rate $250 an hour for his services.
</P>
<P>
   Boies' usual fee is $600 an hour. He expects his total bill to
the Justice Department will be $100,000, although if it were a
corporate client, he said, ``I would have added at least a zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies was hired by Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in
charge of the department's antitrust division. Klein said Thursday
that his division had not handled major antitrust cases for several
years, and he needed a lawyer with long-term experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no substitute for that many years of orchestrating
litigation,'' he said. ``It's a high art form.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies was asked what inspired his career choice. ``Perry
Mason,'' he said. ``Seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies grew up in Orange County, Calif. His father was a high
school history teacher; Boies thought for a time about getting a
doctorate in American history. Instead he married his girlfriend
right after high school, and worked on a construction crew and as a
bookkeeper before graduating from Northwestern University and then
Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Cravath in 1966, made partner in 1972 and left last
year to represent clients like George Steinbrenner, whose interests
collided with some of the companies the firm represents. (Law firms
may not represent competing clients.)
</P>
<P>
   He now has his own firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller, with 23 lawyers and
clients that include CBS and the French government. He has been
married to his third wife, Mary, since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He has a famous fly-paper memory, and loves to gamble in Las
Vegas. &QL;

HAMMOND INNES, 84, PROLIFIC ADVENTURE AND SUSPENSE NOVELIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hammond Innes, the author of ``The Wreck of the Mary Deare'' and
more than 30 other novels of adventure and suspense, died on June
10 in Kersey, England. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   A former artillery major and a yachtsman, Innes traveled the
world in search of stories. Beginning in the late 1930s, he wrote
books about whaling in Antarctica, the oil boom in Canada, the
Berlin airlift and, in the case of ``Mary Deare'' and other novels,
peril on the high seas.
</P>
<P>
   As Anthony Boucher said about ``The Strode Adventurer'' in The
New York Times Book Review: ``Here is one of the sheerly enjoyable
reading experiences of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Orville Prescott, a daily book critic for The New York Times,
was a particular fan of Innes' work, regularly reviewing his novels
with a full bouquet of encomiums. As he said in his review of
``Mary Deare'' in 1956: ``Original in its plot and extraordinarily
clever in its constant succession of mysterious twists and
surprising revelations, it is an utterly engrossing tale.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what critics would have said, Innes' readers were
addicts when it came to his books, which were cinematic in sweep
and sold 40 million copies. Some of his books were made into films,
including ``The Wreck of the Mary Deare'' and ``Campbell's
Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for ``Mary Deere'' was Innes' brush with
disaster when his ship was almost wrecked near the English Channel.
For years, he would spend six months traveling and doing research,
then six months writing. He also wrote a half-dozen works of
nonfiction, including ``Sea and Islands,'' about his voyages on his
ocean racer, the Mary Deare.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Hammond Innes was born in Horsham, England. He began his
career as a journalist and published his first novel, ``The
Doppelganger,'' in 1934, followed by two more books before he
joined the Royal Artillery in 1940. ``Attack Alarm'' was serialized
in The Saturday Evening Post and became his first success. After
World War II, his career moved swiftly as he wrote nearly one
adventure novel a year.
</P>
<P>
   Among his books are ``Fire in the Snow,'' ``Gale Warning'' and
``The Doomed Oasis.'' Beginning with ``The Big Footprints'' in
1977, his books dealt with ecological issues. He kept writing into
the 1990s, with ``Isvik,'' ``Target Antarctica'' and ``Delta
Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.
</P>
<P>
   Innes, who stressed the authenticity of his work, was apparently
a man without literary pretensions. As he said with pride: ``I'm a
storyteller more than anything else.''

ASTRONAUT IMPOSTOR INCOMPETENT, ATTORNEY SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Alabama) 
 
By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Texas man accused of falsely claiming to be an
astronaut, war hero and secret agent is not competent to stand
trial, his attorney said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   During a court hearing, public defender Marjorine Meyers said a
local psychiatrist has determined that Jerry Allen Whittredge of
Galveston is mentally incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers told U.S. Magistrate Judge Calvin Botley that Whittredge
is incapable of assisting in his defense against charges that he
impersonated a federal officer and lied to federal agents _ or even
hiring his own attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Whittredge identified his attorney as William J.
Clinton _ a lawyer whose practice is unknown in the Southern
District of Texas, but who shares the same name as the president of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Whittredge is accused of using false credentials to gain access
to Mission Control at Marshall Space Center in Alabama. He
allegedly told authorities that he was scheduled to fly on a
shuttle mission and was interested in payload operations.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Whittredge toured the space center Nov. 21-22,
1997, and had access to Mission Control. Whittredge also sat at the
console of NASA Mission Control (NASA's most secure area) at
Marshall Space Flight Center during a shuttle mission, court
documents indicate.
</P>
<P>
   On March 16, 1998, Whittredge allegedly gained access to
technical data on a space shuttle thrust propulsion system that is
not available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   And in May, Whittredge allegedly lied his way into a meeting
with senior pilots and the executive officer of the Kingsville
Naval Air Station in Texas. He was ultimately given training on a
T-45 Aircraft Flight Simulator, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Besides claiming to be an astronaut, prosecutors said Whittredge
has claimed to be a Medal of Honor recipient and a CIA official,
according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   But Whittredge was never an astronaut, never received the Medal
of Honor and never worked for the CIA, said prosecutor Mike
Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz has asked Botley to hold Whittredge in the Harris County
Jail until he can be sent to the federal medical center for the
U.S. Bureau of Prisons in Fort Worth for evaluation by government
psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   Because such a move would result in extended incarceration for
Whittredge, Botley ordered a probable cause and detention hearing
for Wednesday morning.

MANHATTAN HOTEL RATES AND DEMAND GO SKY HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also sent with `a' and `f' codes) 
(bl) 
 By NICK RAVO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Looking for a hotel room in Manhattan? You have
plenty of options.
</P>
<P>
   You could book weeks in advance and pay $300 or so a night for a
room at a modern midtown high-rise like the Crowne Plaza. If you're
willing to pay a bit more _ say, $500 a night on average _ you
could probably get something with less of a hassle at the Four
Seasons or the Pierre. Or you could do what a growing number of
visitors are forced to do: stay in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel market in Manhattan, the most expensive in the nation
and fresh off a record year in 1997, continued to tighten in thia
year's first quarter, compared with the first three months of last
year, with the average cost of a night's stay creeping closer to
$200.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the highest first-quarter average daily rate in
Manhattan's history,'' said Dexter Wood, a hotel consultant with
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand.
</P>
<P>
   The market has become so expensive that in the last 18 months,
five hotels _ the Lowell, the St. Regis and the Carlyle, as well as
the Pierre and the Four Seasons _ began charging an average rate of
$500, with some suites running into four figures. No other city in
the nation has even a single hotel with an average rate so high,
industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   And even as prices rise, it is still difficult to find a room in
New York unless it is booked far in advance. That fact has forced
some visitors to stay in New Jersey or not come to the city at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot find a decent hotel room anywhere on Manhattan, it
seems, for less than a fortune,'' said Alan Bennett of Sydney,
Australia, who was planning to come to the city in August. ``We
have searched database after database and rung hotel chains'
reservations centers, all to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has got to the stage where we are about to scrap our plans
to go to New York and instead split our four or five days there
between an extra day or two in Washington and Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who do find a room are often in for a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred bucks!'' said Susan Jeans of Bayport, Minn., who
booked her room at the Crowne Plaza in mid-Manhattan two weeks in
advance. ``We were expecting like $200.''
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a room in Manhattan rose to $189.70 for the
first quarter of the year, according to preliminary figures from
the Coopers &AMP; Lybrand Lodging Research Network. That is a 13.9
percent leap over the $166.58 average room price for the first
quarter of 1997 and a smaller jump over the $187.91 rate for all of
1997. By the end of the year, Coopers &AMP; Lybrand expects average
room rates to rise an additional 10 to 12 percent, surpassing $200,
a figure reached briefly for the first time last fall and
Christmas, the busiest months of the year for many New York hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy rates are nearing records, too. For the first three
months of the year, which are among the slowest for the industry in
New York, hotels were 80.5 percent filled, according to Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand. That's an increase of 5.4 percent over the first quarter
of 1997, and only slightly down from 82 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1997, which was the highest since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand is unprecedented here,'' said Steven Pipes, general
manager of Le Parker Meridien, a hotel in mid-Manhattan. ``People
wanting a room in the fall, if they don't starting making
reservations now, in the early summertime, they will be missing
out.''
</P>
<P>
   John A. Fox, a senior vice president with PKF Consulting, a
hotel and real estate consulting company in Manhattan, said that
business was good for many reasons: the strong local and national
economies; a continuing shortage of rooms; the city's improved
image, and a cheap dollar in many parts of the world, which makes
it affordable for foreign tourists to come to the city and
expensive for Americans to travel abroad. ``The market has been on
a steady upward climb since 1992,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's decision in 1994 to cut its hotel tax to 15 percent
from 21 percent, along with the state's elimination of its 5
percent hotel tax, may have had some impact as well. ``When taxes
are cut, demand usually rises,'' said Adam Brachet, a spokesman for
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand. ``It's not the whole potato, but it's part of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Zawadzk from Bayport, Minn., was hoping to stay at the
Millennium in mid-Manhattan this month, where a conference he was
attending was being held. He could not get a room, though. Instead,
he, like Ms. Jeans, a colleague, stayed at the Crowne Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do lot more planning next time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn Hanson, chairman of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's hotel and casino
division, said, ``It's a hotelier's dream, rates rising at three to
four times inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased business has led not only to the planned
construction in Manhattan of more than 31 hotels, with more than
11,593 rooms, but also to a slight increase in hotel jobs.
According to the state's Labor Department, hotel employment in New
York City rose by 700 jobs, to 36,200, in April from a year
earlier.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is the fastest growth spurt I've ever experienced in the
hotel industry,'' said Kevin Murphy, regional manager for New
Boston Select Staffing, which provides hotels with personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are filling job requests including housekeeping-cooks-wait
staff, and it's not just body-pushing anymore. Hotel skills are in
great demand. The hotel business is searching for skilled labor,
similar to the information technology industry. With the right
experience, you can write your own ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson also said that hotels were curtailing discounts and
weekend packages because the markets were so strong. ``Everything
is priced premium,'' he said. ``And we are also finding that guests
are spending more money in the hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's hotel space squeeze has sent many corporate travel
managers scrambling. J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. now often books people into
the relatively spartan Club Quarters hotel in downtown Manhattan,
which lacks amenities like in-room faxes and room service.
</P>
<P>
   And with the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau projecting
32.5 million out-of-towners coming to the city this year, including
5.9 million from abroad, many business travelers and tourists may
find that accommodations in New Jersey are their only affordable or
available alternative. But even there, the overflow from Manhattan
is making it difficult to find a room.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Eismeier, the treasurer of Colgate University, could
not get a room two weeks ago. ``We tried a dozen or more hotels,
plus a AAA travel agent, plus the Williams Club,'' she said.
``Friends checked the Cornell Club and the Yale Club _ no soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, the agent suggested the Marriott at Newark Airport. ``It
was just fine. It made me want to see if any of our real estate
investment managers were investing in hotel development in New York
City. Seems like the city needs that.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitors bureau advises people trying to find a room to call
the Peak Season Hotel Hot Line at (800) 846-7666, which makes
reservations for more than 80 hotels in various price ranges and
can give availability information. A person really stuck, the
bureau says, should try contacting hotels after 6 p.m. to check on
canceled reservations the hotels have canceled that have not been
guaranteed with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the new hotels going up, it is probable, according
to Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, that only 4,000 to 5,000 of the approximately
12,000 rooms that are planned will be built; there are now about
54,600 rooms in Manhattan and 6,000 in the rest of the city.

 Got Soup?   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Ever notice those little milk cartons sitting next to the spinach
fettuccine in the cold-food section of the supermarket?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever wonder why milk cartons were sitting next to the spinach
fettuccine in the cold-food section of the supermarket?
</P>
<P>
   If so, you can understand the challenge faced by Glencoe Foods
Inc., a company with British roots that plans a major U.S. roll-out
of fresh-prepared soups sold in pint-sized, white cartons.
</P>
<P>
   With flavors like wild mushroom, carrot-coriander and Thai green
curry, the soups, sold under the New Covent Garden label, probably
will never match mass-appeal brands such as Campbell's.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have the potential for widespread acceptance among
people who tend to buy premium food, said food industry
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Because New Covent Garden soups are prepared with techniques
similar to those used by home cooks, their flavors and textures
stand out from the dried ramen packs and mushy, highly processed
canned products that dominate supermarket shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The cartons are microwaveable, an appealing feature in this
convenience-crazed society. And at $2.99 to $3.69 per pint, they
make an affordable light meal or appetizer for one or two people.
</P>
<P>
   If the company can replicate the 7 percent market share of its
United Kingdom affiliate, New Covent Garden Soups Co. Ltd., it
would ring up $260 million a year in the United States, where
consumers spend $3.7 billion annually on packaged soups.
</P>
<P>
   But the cartons' close resemblance to the stuff Americans pour
over their Cheerios every morning is just one hurdle Glencoe must
overcome to make a dent in the world's largest consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   Most people are creatures of habit, and Americans are not used
to buying soup in cardboard cartons. Nor are they accustomed to
looking in the refrigerator section for soup, so simply finding the
product and recognizing it will be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   New Covent Garden, an unknown name among U.S. consumers, is
fighting such mega-brands as Campbell's and Progresso _ not to
mention pasta, carry-out sandwiches and other foods people look for
in light meals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the soup's fat and sodium contents, which don't
phase Brits, are unacceptably high for many health-conscious U.S.
eaters. And some of the popular British flavors, such as fresh
haddock, and Brussels sprouts with chestnuts, are not likely to sit
well with Americans. (In fact, the company isn't even considering
bringing those flavors here).
</P>
<P>
   Glencoe, a licensee of its United Kingdom affiliate, has spent
three years testing and honing its products in this country and
outfitting a $5 million processing plant in Modesto.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 1995, the company has been flying the soup in from the
United Kingdom to about 45 Bay Area supermarkets for consumer
testing. It is planning a roll-out in August to the rest of
Northern California as well as Portland, Seattle, Denver and Salt
Lake City, and hopes to sign up some major supermarket chains as
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Glencoe, which is funded by two private investors and
a venture capital firm, intends to sell soup throughout the United
States. Alastair Dorward, president of the company, said about $8
million has been invested to date.
</P>
<P>
   The soups that will roll out of Modesto in August will have a
very different look than those now being imported from the United
Kingdom, which were designed to stand in tasteful contrast to the
``gaudy and photographic'' packaging of United Kingdom products,
said Dorward.
</P>
<P>
   The new cartons, designed by the San Francisco firm Deutsch
Design, have a colorful, Mediterranean look. Fresh-looking
vegetables are artfully painted, and the word ``soup'' is written
in eye-catching large script.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the packaging to scream `soup,''' said Steve
Goldman, general manager of Deutsch Design.
</P>
<P>
   Glencoe is also reformulating its recipes for the American
palette. This summer it will introduce two New World flavors, spicy
corn chowder and black bean-green chile. And the U.S.-made soups
will have lower salt and fat contents than their British
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Glencoe can't afford to advertise, so it relies on in-store
sampling and word of mouth to raise awareness for its products,
said Dorward.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its modest marketing efforts, sales have been growing 50
percent annually in local test stores, which include Whole Foods,
Cala Foods, Mollie Stone's and Andronico's, he said. Seven New
Covent Garden soup flavors rank among the top 15 packaged soups in
stores where they are sold, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The soups may get some lift from a new popularity of fresh soup
in the United States, a trend that so far has manifested itself
more in new soup-oriented restaurants than in supermarket products,
said Marcia Schurer, president of Culinary Connections, a food
consulting firm in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Schurer believes there is enough pent-up demand for quality
soups to virtually ensure Glenco's success in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have always had a taste for fresh, home-made tasting
soup and the problem has always been the supply,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mattson, a processed-food consultant and developer, also
expects New Covent Garden soups to do well here.
</P>
<P>
   The soup tastes good because it is cooked at relatively low
temperatures _ about 160 degrees Fahrenheit, or about the same as
soup made in a home kitchen or restaurant, said Mattson, chairman
of Mattson &AMP; Co. in Foster City.
</P>
<P>
   After cooking, the New Covent Garden soups are quickly cooled,
packaged and sealed in a sterile environment so they last on
supermarket shelves for two to three weeks, said Mattson.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's soup, by contrast, is cooked under pressure, in the
can, at about 245 degrees Fahrenheit, said Mattson. With heating
and cooling times, ``it might be above boiling for half an hour,
which is why if you close your eyes and eat a carrot, you might
think you're eating a potato,'' he said. ``It's mush.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Soup Co., based in Camden, N.J., did not respond to
requests for comment.

MANHATTAN HOTEL RATES AND DEMAND GO SKY HIGH

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Looking for a hotel room in Manhattan? You have
plenty of options.
</P>
<P>
   You could book weeks in advance and pay $300 or so a night for a
room at a modern midtown high-rise like the Crowne Plaza. If you're
willing to pay a bit more _ say, $500 a night on average _ you
could probably get something with less of a hassle at the Four
Seasons or the Pierre. Or you could do what a growing number of
visitors are forced to do: stay in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel market in Manhattan, the most expensive in the nation
and fresh off a record year in 1997, continued to tighten in thia
year's first quarter, compared with the first three months of last
year, with the average cost of a night's stay creeping closer to
$200.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the highest first-quarter average daily rate in
Manhattan's history,'' said Dexter Wood, a hotel consultant with
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand.
</P>
<P>
   The market has become so expensive that in the last 18 months,
five hotels _ the Lowell, the St. Regis and the Carlyle, as well as
the Pierre and the Four Seasons _ began charging an average rate of
$500, with some suites running into four figures. No other city in
the nation has even a single hotel with an average rate so high,
industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   And even as prices rise, it is still difficult to find a room in
New York unless it is booked far in advance. That fact has forced
some visitors to stay in New Jersey or not come to the city at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot find a decent hotel room anywhere on Manhattan, it
seems, for less than a fortune,'' said Alan Bennett of Sydney,
Australia, who was planning to come to the city in August. ``We
have searched database after database and rung hotel chains'
reservations centers, all to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has got to the stage where we are about to scrap our plans
to go to New York and instead split our four or five days there
between an extra day or two in Washington and Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who do find a room are often in for a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred bucks!'' said Susan Jeans of Bayport, Minn., who
booked her room at the Crowne Plaza in mid-Manhattan two weeks in
advance. ``We were expecting like $200.''
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a room in Manhattan rose to $189.70 for the
first quarter of the year, according to preliminary figures from
the Coopers &AMP; Lybrand Lodging Research Network. That is a 13.9
percent leap over the $166.58 average room price for the first
quarter of 1997 and a smaller jump over the $187.91 rate for all of
1997. By the end of the year, Coopers &AMP; Lybrand expects average
room rates to rise an additional 10 to 12 percent, surpassing $200,
a figure reached briefly for the first time last fall and
Christmas, the busiest months of the year for many New York hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy rates are nearing records, too. For the first three
months of the year, which are among the slowest for the industry in
New York, hotels were 80.5 percent filled, according to Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand. That's an increase of 5.4 percent over the first quarter
of 1997, and only slightly down from 82 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1997, which was the highest since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand is unprecedented here,'' said Steven Pipes, general
manager of Le Parker Meridien, a hotel in mid-Manhattan. ``People
wanting a room in the fall, if they don't starting making
reservations now, in the early summertime, they will be missing
out.''
</P>
<P>
   John A. Fox, a senior vice president with PKF Consulting, a
hotel and real estate consulting company in Manhattan, said that
business was good for many reasons: the strong local and national
economies; a continuing shortage of rooms; the city's improved
image, and a cheap dollar in many parts of the world, which makes
it affordable for foreign tourists to come to the city and
expensive for Americans to travel abroad. ``The market has been on
a steady upward climb since 1992,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's decision in 1994 to cut its hotel tax to 15 percent
from 21 percent, along with the state's elimination of its 5
percent hotel tax, may have had some impact as well. ``When taxes
are cut, demand usually rises,'' said Adam Brachet, a spokesman for
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand. ``It's not the whole potato, but it's part of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Zawadzk from Bayport, Minn., was hoping to stay at the
Millennium in mid-Manhattan this month, where a conference he was
attending was being held. He could not get a room, though. Instead,
he, like Ms. Jeans, a colleague, stayed at the Crowne Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do lot more planning next time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn Hanson, chairman of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's hotel and casino
division, said, ``It's a hotelier's dream, rates rising at three to
four times inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased business has led not only to the planned
construction in Manhattan of more than 31 hotels, with more than
11,593 rooms, but also to a slight increase in hotel jobs.
According to the state's Labor Department, hotel employment in New
York City rose by 700 jobs, to 36,200, in April from a year
earlier.
</P>

   ``This is the fastest growth spurt I've ever experienced in the

Boston Select Staffing, which provides hotels with personnel.

5.9 million from abroad, many business travelers and tourists may
find that accommodations in New Jersey are their only affordable or

was just fine. It made me want to see if any of our real estate
investment managers were investing in hotel development in New York
City. Seems like the city needs that.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitors bureau advises people trying to find a room to call
the Peak Season Hotel Hot Line at (800) 846-7666, which makes
reservations for more than 80 hotels in various price ranges and
can give availability information. A person really stuck, the
bureau says, should try contacting hotels after 6 p.m. to check on
canceled reservations the hotels have canceled that have not been
guaranteed with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the new hotels going up, it is probable, according
to Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, that only 4,000 to 5,000 of the approximately
12,000 rooms that are planned will be built; there are now about
54,600 rooms in Manhattan and 6,000 in the rest of the city.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Black Leaders Ask For Clamp On Hiring Foreigners  
   
 By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
A coalition of black leaders asked the U.S. Department of Labor
yesterday to consider prohibiting Silicon Valley companies that
fail to hire enough blacks and Latinos from bringing in temporary
foreign workers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The novel idea was part of a package of suggestions presented by
the newly formed Coalition for Fair Employment in the Silicon
Valley during a meeting with Department of Labor officials. The
coalition met with the San Jose regional office that is responsible
for enforcing affirmative action among government contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The &UR;  &LR; meeting was sparked by a Chronicle investigation last month
that showed blacks and Latinos are significantly underrepresented
in Silicon Valley's leading firms, as compared with the Bay Area
workforce overall.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also found that many of the top technology
firms had been cited by the Department of Labor for failing to
actively recruit blacks and Latinos _ but most were not fined or
penalized in any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared to us (from The Chronicle articles) that the Labor
Department wasn't aggressively dealing with the issue,'' said Henry
Hutchins, president of the Bay Area Black MBAs and a member of the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Department officials worked to dispel that notion during a
three-hour meeting with the coalition yesterday but made no
promises about future actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exploratory meeting, and we listened very
carefully,'' said Woody Gilliland, deputy regional director of the
Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliland said his office does not have the authority to choose
which companies receive work permits for overseas workers, but that
he would refer the coalition to an appropriate contact in the
federal government. His office does not have the power to fine
contractors unless they owe back pay to an employee who was
unfairly denied a job.
</P>
<P>
   Denying work vias to Silicon Valley companies would be a strong
blow because many firms rely on foreign workers to fill skilled
positions that they claim cannot be filled with U.S. workers. Even
with foreign workers, industry leaders estimate that there are
hundreds of thousands of unfilled technology jobs nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But the black leaders in this group said they told the
Department of Labor about many instances when qualified black
candidates had been overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is, if you are not hiring blacks and Latinos locally,
then how can you go outside the country to hire workers?'' said
Hutchins of the Black MBAs.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition member George Whaley, a San Jose State University
professor, said he plans to crunch some numbers showing the
availability of qualified blacks and Latinos for high-tech jobs.
The coalition hopes to provide these numbers to the Department of
Labor to use as ammunition for turning down work permits requested
by companies that have lagged in minority hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to point out that there are (minority) people out
there who can do these jobs,'' said San Francisco resident John
Templeton, the leader of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition was formed by the Bay Area Black MBAs, Bay Area
Black Data Processing Associates and the Peninsula Area Black
Personnel Administrators.

EDITORIAL: ENDGAME IN ALBANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, June 13:
</P>
<P>
   The pre-election stupor that has afflicted New York's state
Legislature in recent months now means that Albany has only a few
days left to wrestle with some of the most crucial issues on this
year's agenda. Here is an abbreviated list of important matters
that need immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC SCHOOL AID: Gov. George Pataki's recent budget vetoes
spell real trouble for New York City's public schools. He
eliminated $202 million to repair deterioriating schoolrooms. He
also cut funds that would help the city compete for 30,000 new
teachers over the next four years _ just when the state is
tightening standards, launching a pre-kindergarten program and
ordering cuts in class size. The extra money for teachers is
apparently being held hostage to Pataki's charter school proposal,
a program that would benefit only a small percentage of the state's
students. The Legislature should ignore the governor's agenda and
restore these cuts.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Pataki could muster a timely show of support for
the efforts by New York City Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew to end
tenure for school principals. Tenure provides job protection for
mediocrities who cannot currently be held accountable for the
failure of their students.
</P>
<P>
   THE HUDSON RIVER PARK: After months of sparring, Pataki and New
Y(CT)ork City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are now in agreement on most
of the troublesome issues surrounding the creation of a riverside
park on Manhattan's West Side. Both have pledged $100 million
toward the project, which would replace the rotting piers and
industrial detritus between 59th Street and the Battery with an
inviting mix of open space and modest commercial development. The
dream will move even closer to reality if the Legislature approves
a bill governing the design, management and financing of the park.
The bill's provisions dealing with open space protection and the
amount of allowable development may require tightening. But this
can be done in less than a day if Pataki and Sheldon Silver, the
Democratic leader of the state Assembly, apply themselves to the
task. Future generations of New Yorkers will be greatly in their
debt if they do so.
</P>
<P>
   COURT REFORM: Chief Judge Judith Kaye's user-friendly plan to
streamline New York's convoluted court system deserves legislative
agreement this session. Unfortunately, Silver has proposed a
narrower alternative that would leave much of the system intact and
would link court restructuring to permanent funding for legal
services _ a non-starter in the Republican Senate. The underfunding
of legal services is a pressing concern, but it should not be used
as political cover to stop court reform.
</P>
<P>
   THE INSURANCE BOONDOGGLE: Some mutual insurance companies _
companies owned by their policyholders but in reality run by
self-perpetuating boards of directors _ have persuaded Pataki to
back a bill that serves management alone. In simplest terms, the
bill would allow companies to sell stock without compensating the
policyholders. It would also shield the companies from takeover
threats, making it hard for shareholders to change management. The
Assembly should stop this self-serving legislation in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   There are other unresolved issues. This could be the year, for
example, when Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno finally allows
the Senate to vote on a long-overdue change in the state's civil
rights laws that would bar discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. Should common sense prevail, the Assembly's strong
measure aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of children by
requiring safe storage of weapons may carry the day against an
insulting Senate version that can only please the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   As a final gesture, Albany could astonish its critics by
revamping a campaign financing system that imposes no limits on
``soft-money'' donations to party slush funds and tolerates
obscenely high donations to individual candidates. That, of course,
may be asking too much. But there is enough time left for the
Legislature to redeem what has been an oddly disoriented and
passive year. &QL;

 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ After a bout of winter blues that has
dragged on for much of the last decade, European business has
finally come back to life.
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence is in the Continent's stock markets. From
Spain to Germany, market indexes have outpaced those in the United
States, with some climbing a third or more in just the last six
months.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom in Europe is more than a bull market. Europe is
going through at least four historic financial transformations _
each of which is likely to alter the investment landscape for years
to come, all of them likely to benefit investors:
</P>
<P>
   CURRENCY UNION _ On Jan. 1, some 11 nations led by France and
Germany will adopt the euro as a common currency, creating a
unified economic entity almost as big as the United States. The
euro looms behind every other major trend in Europe, accelerating
the broad movement toward greater competition and free-market
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMIC CONVERGENCE _ For the first time this century, interest
rates and inflation are now almost as low in Spain and Italy as
they are in Germany. Thanks largely to the stringent economic
requirements for joining the ``euro club,'' governments across the
Continent sharply reduced budget deficits and yoked themselves to
austere monetary policies. Now the reward is at hand, in the form
of faster growth and stable prices.
</P>
<P>
   CORPORATE OVERHAUL _ Under growing competitive pressure
worldwide, European conglomerates are embracing Wall Street's
priorities: profits and the concept of ``shareholder value.''
Companies that once were opaque to many investors are now listing
their shares in New York and opening up their books. They are also
slashing costs, selling off businesses that do not perform and
merging like mad to shore up the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The revamping has cost millions of European workers their jobs,
and companies are still not as profitable, on average, as their
American counterparts. But the renewed strength is measurable.
</P>
<P>
   A STAMPEDE TOWARD STOCKS _ Perhaps the most profound change is
the surge in equity investing by individual Europeans. As recently
as two years ago, Europeans avoided stocks in favor of cautious
securities like government bonds. Now they are flooding the stock
markets with tens of billions of dollars, and most analysts expect
the torrent to become even bigger in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the deluge has been driven by two big changes. One
is lower interest rates, which have eroded returns on bonds. The
second is the growing weakness in government-run pension programs,
which are amassing mountains of commitments without the means to
honor them. The result is a rush to mutual funds and a political
trend toward promoting American-style private pension funds, which
in turn become huge buyers of equities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are looking at a set of circumstances that occur only a
few times a century,'' said Phil De Cristo, head of operations in
Continental Europe for Fidelity Investments. ``We look at Europe as
being our prime engine of growth over the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that means that Europe is a safe bet. For one thing,
prices have climbed so far, so fast, that some markets may already
be dangerously overvalued. For another, though most experts are
increasingly confident that the new European Central Bank will
establish stability and credibility for the euro, there is still
ample room for problems. And even if the euro proceeds according to
plan, it will create losers as well as winners.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, European economic prospects are better than they have
been in years. Total economic growth should reach 3 percent this
year, possibly outpacing growth in the United States. Already,
annual growth rates for Portugal, Spain and Finland are rising by
about 4 percent, while Ireland is up by more than 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you combine the prospects for economic growth, low budget
deficits, low or negligible inflation and low interest rates, you
have an economic proposition that is almost embarrassingly rich,''
said George Hodgson, head of equity research at the Dutch bank
ABN-Amro. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though the debut of the euro next year will have little direct
impact on Europe's growth and prosperity, the preparations have had
a huge effect on governments, companies and investors.
</P>
<P>
   European political leaders reached the point of no return May 3,
when they formally decided to introduce the euro Jan. 1 as the
currency of 11 countries: Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and
Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Denmark and Sweden decided to stay out of the monetary
union, though they met the qualifications to join. Greece was the
only member of the European Union that could not meet the
standards, and it hopes to join in several years.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has already transformed economic policy across the
Continent, as governments slashed budget deficits and generous
social programs. In the process, inflation was nearly eliminated in
historically turbulent countries like Spain, Italy and Portugal.
Interest rates in these so-called ``Club Med'' countries have
plunged by half in just two years.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, stock markets in Madrid, Lisbon and Milan have
soared faster than almost any others in Europe in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the euro also promises to alter profoundly
Europe's capital markets. Though the actual bills and coins will
not begin to circulate until 2002, stocks and bonds will be traded
in euros Jan. 1. In effect, that creates a huge new European market
for stocks and bonds that could eventually rival Wall Street in
global importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the European Union, what we are talking about is
redefining the idea of a home market,'' said De Cristo of Fidelity.
``You are creating a massive new entity, which is Europe or
Euroland.''
</P>
<P>
   For corporations trying to raise capital, that is both good and
bad news. On the one hand, it makes it easier to tap a much bigger
pool of potential investors. But it also exposes them to bruising
new international comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   According to Salomon Smith Barney, for example, the average
return on equity for Italian companies was about 9.9 percent last
year. By contrast, German companies earned about 12 percent and
Finnish companies earned nearly 21 percent. (In the United States,
return on equity averaged about 20 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Competition is also heating up in the real world, the market for
goods and services. Even though the European Union already permits
almost entirely free trade between member nations, the babble of
different currencies continues to cloak price differences between
identical products in different markets. In Germany, a cottage
industry of automobile ``re-importers'' buys up Mercedeses and
Volkswagens in neighboring countries and then re-sells them to
Germans at prices lower than those of German car dealers.
</P>
<P>
   In the new Europe, the camouflage disappears and price pressures
are expected to increase. ``The single currency will put pressure
on manufacturers,'' acknowledged Manfred Gentz, the chief financial
officer of Daimler-Benz. ``But the benefits far outweigh the
disadvantages, and that kind of competition is healthy anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   It had better be, because the scramble for position in the
pan-European market has contributed to an accelerated pace of
mergers and acquisitions. Daimler-Benz's stunning deal to take over
Chrysler Corp., the third-largest American automaker, was merely
the most visible of many huge deals, others of which have involved
European banks, retailers, chemical companies and steel producers.
In dollars, the value of European mergers jumped to $484 billion in
1997, from about $170 billion in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole philosophy behind the single market was to enable
European companies to enjoy the same economies of scale that
companies in the United States and Japan were perceived to enjoy,''
said Mark Howdle, head of European equity strategy at Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   When they are not merging, Europe's industrial conglomerates
have become increasingly preoccupied with improving their
performance. One example: Royal Philips Electronics, the Dutch
manufacturer of consumer electronics, saw profits nearly evaporate
two years ago as a result of several flopped products and a
disastrous alliance with Grundig AG, the troubled German
manufacturer. After severing ties to Grundig and cutting 6,000
jobs, Philips has bounced back with high profits and a soaring
stock price.
</P>
<P>
   While individual stories do not add up to a trend, there are
broader signs of improvement. Excluding Britain, Europe has seen
corporate return on equity climb to more than 14 percent in 1998,
from about 11 percent in 1996, according to Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   But that remains well behind performance in the United States,
and pessimists interpret the numbers to mean that Continental
Europe remains shy about serious revamping.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists, though, see the data as evidence that European
companies still have much opportunity for rapid increases in
profitability. ``The party is only beginning,'' said Hodgson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the Stock Market Game, but we take it very
seriously,'' said Peter Nemec, host and producer of ``3 Sat
Boerse'', Germany's most popular television show for investors. A
lot of other people take it seriously, too.
</P>
<P>
   Every Friday night over a six-month period, three investment
advisers compete on Nemec's show, offering their best stock picks.
Each adviser is given an imaginary pot of 100,000 German marks, and
the one whose pot is biggest at the end of six months wins the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, few people were interested. But today, as many
as a million viewers tune in. And when contestants tout their
newest favorites, traders say, those stocks routinely surge on
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has finally discovered stocks,'' exulted Nemec, who
could barely scrape together 100,000 viewers when he started in
1988. ``When I go to shopping on Saturdays, the shopkeepers
recognize me and start asking me what stocks they should buy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to overstate the change in mind-set among
investors in Germany, and, indeed, across most of Continental
Europe. European investors who till recently favored the safety of
bonds are a key force behind the bull market. Last year, they
poured more than $70 billion into stock-oriented mutual funds, up
from just $10 billion in 1996. In Italy, where interest rates have
plunged by more than half in the last year, $7 billion flowed into
stock funds in April alone. Spanish investors have been on a
similar rampage.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, private households have more than doubled their
stock holdings in the last three years, to about $300 billion. When
Deutsche Bank started a new mutual fund for small European stocks
last April, investors contributed more than $300 million in the
first few days.
</P>
<P>
   Such lemming-like behavior often is observed in overripe
markets. And Europe's mobilization of money does not necessarily
mean that its markets will continue to soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liquidity can be a dangerous animal,'' Hodgson said. After
all, in an electronic marketplace where trillions of dollars move
around the world every day, mutual fund and pension managers
routinely redirect their money when conditions change.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also note that stock valuations are at historic highs
in both Europe and the United States. Spain's red-hot stock market
has retreated about 10 percent in the last month, apparently
because investors became convinced that stock prices had lost touch
with reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``European valuations look very rich,'' said David Bowers, an
equity strategist for Merrill Lynch in London. ``There isn't much
room for disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are echoes in Europe's boom that make many investors
take heart. The flood of money, they say, is reminiscent of what
happened in the United States during the early 1980s, when
inflation finally subsided and the bull market began to take off.
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, European investors have proved
dissatisfied with diminishing bond returns and low interest rates
on savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have gotten along on gilt-edged bonds suddenly
realize that they have to get their returns up,'' said Jonathan
Freeman, an investment banker at Beeson Gregory, a London-based
stock brokerage firm. ``It is a new game for a lot of people, but I
think you are going to see it for a long time.''

SHUTTLE RETURN MARKS END FOR MIR MISSIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Hang out the vacancy sign.
</P>
<P>
   An unprecedented 812 days of continuous U.S. presence in space
drew to a close Friday as the shuttle Discovery returned to Earth
carrying marathon astronaut Andy Thomas, the final American
assigned to live and work aboard Russia's Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's return after a 10-day round trip to Mir wrapped up a
three-year series of docking missions to the Russian orbital
outpost. The operation enabled seven Americans to make extended
stays on the Russian station to help prepare for the challenge of
assembling a new international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery touched down at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida
at 1 p.m. CDT, with commander Charles Precourt and pilot Dominic
Gorie at the controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greetings,'' chirped Thomas, 46, minutes after Discovery
rolled to a stop. ``I want to thank you all for bringing me home
and giving me a great ride,'' he radioed colleagues in mission
control in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was smiling, giving a thumbs-up,'' said astronaut Franklin
Chang-Diaz, who was strapped in next to Thomas during the descent.
``He was in real good spirits.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Thomas, who logged 141 days aloft, received a thorough medical
exam immediately after landing. Like his U.S. predecessors on Mir,
he will embark on an intensive 45-day rehabilitation program
designed to rebuild the skeletal and muscle strength lost during
his long exposure to weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before his return to Earth, Thomas told NASA he wanted a
meal of lasagna and Oreo Cookie ice cream when he landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really looking forward to that first meal,'' he joked
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, Precourt, Gorie, Chang-Diaz and crewmates Janet Kavand,
Wendy Lawrence and Valery Ryumin are scheduled to return to Houston
on Saturday night. NASA planned a brief public welcoming ceremony
at Ellington Field.
</P>
<P>
   With Discovery's landing, the Russians regained the distinction
of being Earth's sole permanent occupants of space. Cosmonauts
Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin will remain aboard Mir until
August.
</P>
<P>
   America's 812-day run began March 22, 1996, with the shuttle
Atlantis bringing Shannon Lucid to Mir. Her 188 days in space, the
current U.S. record, initiated the relay that was continued by
astronauts John Blaha, Jerry Linenger, Mike Foale, David Wolf and
finally Thomas. Mir's first U.S. visitor, astronaut Norman Thagard,
logged 115 days in the spring and summer of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   As NASA's Mir collaboration began three years ago, it appeared
that the end of that program would overlap the initial staffing of
the new station. At the time, construction of the new station was
to have begun in late 1997, with a three-man crew led by astronaut
Bill Shepherd slated to arrive in May of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But chronic funding problems in Russia have delayed the new
station's first habitable component, the Russian-furnished service
module. Plans to start construction have been postponed until
November.
</P>
<P>
   With the service module now essentially constructed and its
mission to Mir drawn to a successful close on Friday, NASA was
eager to look on the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   Agency administrator Dan Goldin, one of the principle architects
of the U.S.-Russian collaboration, greeted Thomas in Florida with
flowers. Normally a stern figure, Goldin embraced Frank Culbertson,
the astronaut who successfully steered the program through a series
of crises last year as Mir was rocked by fire, a near-disastrous
collision and failing life support systems.
</P>
<P>
   In response, support in Congress eroded. The White House offered
little public support.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started out, we didn't know each other,'' said Goldin.
``Now, we know the Russians, and we know with certainty we're going
to open up the universe to benefit life on this planet. This is not
the end, it's just the start of a new phase.''

 By BARBARA BELEJACK 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ It was a very good year, especially for the Grupo
Elektra employees, their spouses and business partners who gathered
at the MGM Hotel in Las Vegas for the annual company convention.
 &HT;    Between lectures on neuro-linguistics and trips to the slot
machines, they gawked at TV Azteca actress Lucia Mendez, listened
to TV Aztec talk show host Paty Chapoy, and Armando Manzanero, the
singer composer of the theme song to a TV Azteca telenovela. And
above all, they listened to the star of the show, the man with the
trademark wire-rim glasses, perfectly trimmed, graying beard, and
headset mike.
 &HT;    Flanked by Las Vegas chorus girls and an oversized yellow smiley
button (the Elektra logo), and acting every bit the motivational
guru, Ricardo Salinas Pliego told them what they already knew: 1997
was a very good year; things were going to get even better. At
Grupo Elektra si se puede!
 &HT;    At 42, the president and CEO of Grupo Elektra (Mexico's largest
retail chain), and TV Azteca, has been described as an upstart
maverick, a brilliant visionary, just plain arrogant and more than
a bit cynical.
 &HT;    What else can you say about a billionaire who figured out how to
sell things to people with minimal purchasing power? Who described
a US$29 million loan as ``irrelevant''? Who is currently enmeshed
in a nasty business divorce, a closely watched legal battle with
U.S. TV giant NBC? You could say he is a man who knows how to turn
a company around and make money. Threeyeas ago, who would have
believed that TV Azteca would take over one-third of the television
market in Mexico, asks Leonardo Simpser, an analyst with Deutsche
Morgan Grenfell in Mexico City. With his combination of retail
stores, distribution network, credit and technology, Salinas could
introduce almost any new business and make it his. He could be the
next Carlos Slim, says Simpser; he could be ``The Big Kahuna.''
 &HT;    Even his staunchest critics grudgingly admit that Salinas has
managed to dramatically turn around both Elektra and TV Azteca, the
former state-run television network he bought five years ago. Now
he's turned his sights toward the rest of Latin America, as well as
to the lucrative Spanish-language market in the United States.
 &HT;    Salinas did not grant an interview for this article despite
several requests.
 &HT;    ``When we talk about our group of companies, we talk about
outgrowing Mexico,'' he told a group of analysts, fund managers and
potential investors last February at the Four Seasons in New York's
World Trade Center. ``That's not because we think we've gotten too
big for Mexico, but because our group's sales and cash flow have
tripled the growth of the Mexican economy.'' As performances, go,
Salinas's New York presentation, was only a slightly more subdued
version of his message in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    Hoopla and hype aside, these are the facts: Last year, total net
revenue of Elektra, TV Azteca, and a paging service called Biper
reached $1.3 billion. Net income totalled more than $220 million.
TV Azteca had the number one-ranked nightly news program in Mexico
and the number one telenovela (soap opera).
 &HT;    The network beat Mexican media giant Televisa at its own game
with Mirada de Mujer, featuring a 50-year-old woman who turns the
tables on her unfaithful husband and finds happiness with a much
younger man.
 &HT;    With just two channels compared with Televisa's four, TV Azteca
managed to capture 35 percent of the television audienceand nearly
as much of the advertising market. By the end of the year the
network was producing 85 percent of its prime time programming, up
from 36 percent in December 1995. Azteca officials insist that
they'll reach 100 percent in-house prime time production this year
and produce 10 novelas. Meanwhile, Salinas has opened stores in
Chile, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and the Dominican Republic.
 &HT;    As he travels south, Salinas pushes the total package-Elektra,
TV Azteca and Biper. So far, he has managed to buy two small
networks in Chile and El Salvador and a UHF channel in Guatemala, a
relatively modest expense compared with the production costs of
those 10 telenovelas.
 &HT;    In 1997, TV Azteca entered the world financial markets, raising
US$425 million in bonds and $605 million in its August IPO, the
largest public offering of a Mexican company since the December
1994 peso devaluation. Along with his international expansion,
Salinas has announced plans to create a holding company that would
combine TV Azteca with Elektra and its subsidiaries, the clothing
chain Hecali, Biper and credit and money-wire services. At the
outset, Salinas will hold about 40 percent of the shares, but
analysts predict he will soon buy out his relatives, just as he
bought out his Azteca partners, Alberto and Moises Saba Raffoul,
last year.
 &HT;    In addition, Salinas bid almost $300 million in a government
auction of radio-frequency licenses. He's betting that a ``fixed
wireless,'' low-cost phone service will be a sure winner in a
country with a teledensity of less than 10 percent. Finally, in
contrast to rival Televisa, pay network Multivision and their
global partners, Salinas is making a high-stakes bet on digital
television rather than DTH.
 &HT;    Just five years ago, when Salinas bought TV Azteca, ``people saw
him as a refrigerator or microwave salesman,'' says CFO Adrian
Steckel, who left an investment banking career at Dillon Reed to
join Azteca in 1994. Finance writers and analysts weren't paying
attention to a family of regiomontanos (men from business city
Monterrey in Northern Mexico) they considered second- or
third-tier, compared with the better known powers behind Mexican
companies such as Alfa, Visa and Vitro. (Salinas was born in Mexico
City in October 1955, but is usually referred to as a
regiomontano.)
 &HT;    What they weren't following was the criss-cross of Monterrey
business and family relationships, which can be as complicated as
those in a Russian novel-or Mexican telenovela.
 &HT;    His family got its start in business when Benjamin Salinas
teamed up with his brother-in-law Joel Rocha in 1907 to found what
would eventually become the department store chain of Salinas y
Rocha. In the 1950s, Benjamin's only son, Hugo, founded a company
called Elektra that manufactured televisions and radios. When the
Rochas ousted him from the department stores, he retaliated by
turning Elektra into a rival retail business. In 1981, Hugo's
grandson joined Elektra after graduating from the Monterrey Tec and
Tulane, and brief stints at Arthur Anderson and Grupo Visa. Ricardo
Salinas Pliego arrived just in time for the debt crisis that
devastated Elektra. He responded with the same formula he would
apply at TV Azteca: Cut costs and revamp technology. He also
changed the company's customer and merchandise base. Instead of
trying to be an all-purpose department store catering to the middle
class, it began to focus on low-income customers, people with
negligible purchasing power, who were able to buy basic household
appliances and furniture on extended - and hefty -credit plans.
 &HT;    In 1991, Salinas was named president and CEO of Elektra, which
went public two years later.
 &HT;    ``[Ricardo] is a more polished version of my brother, Hugo,''
says Ricardo's great-aunt Irma Salinas Rocha, a keen observer of
the social and business scene in Monterrey.
 &HT;    ``Hugo was a big risk taker,'' Salinas says of her only brother.
 &HT;    ``And so is Ricardo; he's building an empire ... I wouldn't want
to have to compete with him.''
 &HT;    Although he was considered a lightweight during the 1993
privatization process, his original partner was not. Francisco
Aguirre Gomez came from a family that owned and operated a
profitable group of radio stations. They also had experience with
the Azcarraga family and Televisa. After nearly 20 years of
petitioning, they were finally granted a television broadcast
concession in 1968, only to have President Luis Echeverria
orchestrate its nationalization several years later. With the 1993
sale, Francisco Aguirre had a chance at vindication, by bidding on
a media package that included the same television station his
family had lost. But just weeks before the bid was to be awarded,
he parted ways with Salinas Pliego for reasons that were never
explained except for cryptic references to ``differences in
temperament.'' At the last minute, Salinas replaced Francisco
Aguirre with two brothers, Alberto and Moises Saba Raffoul, whose
fortune derived from investments in the textile and petrochemical
industries.
 &HT;    When the bids were opened, their $640 million bid was 30 percent
higher than the next-highest bid. The man whose family had started
off manufacturing and later selling television sets was on his way
to becoming a media mogul.
 &HT;    Salinas told the newsmagazine Proceso that if Mexican viewers
were looking for an alternative to the pro-government stance of
Televisa, they would have to wait a little bit longer.
 &HT;    ``I didn't buy these channels to criticize the government,'' he
said. ``Besides, Mexico is not ready for democracy * Television is
mainly for entertainment and for women who stay at home.'' But
Salinas had big ideas and talked about negotiations with Brazil's
TV Globo, NBC, and with Silvio Berlusconi of Italy. He invested in
technology and extended the penetration of his two channels, 7 and
13, throughout Mexico. He hired a youthful, folksy anchor, Javier
Alatorre, for the nightly news program Hechos-another generation
and another style, compared with Jacobo Zabludovsky, the longtime
anchor of Televisa's 24 Horas. He hired the head of the
Encyclopedia Britannica, Sergio Sarmiento, also known for his
conservative economic commentary in print and radio journalism, to
direct Azteca's news division, and hired away other young
``talent'' in finance and accounting. (Steckel is 31) Azteca had
little to offer in the way of original programming, but managed to
attract attention by importing shows like The Simpsons and The
Wonder Years, considered unique at the time in Mexico. In 1994,
Azteca signed a highly publicized deal with NBC, described
glowingly by executives in Rockefeller Center as the network's
first post-NAFTA deal, ``a growth, growth, growth story.'' NBC
bought an option to purchase 10 percent of TV Azteca, and also
promised to provide technical advice. That summer, Mexican soccer
fans had an alternative to Televisa coverage of the World Cup, and
an estimated 40 percent of them tuned in to TV Azteca.
 &HT;    Elektra weathered the 1995 economic crisis with a boost from its
Western Union money transfer service that turned dollars earned by
Mexican workers in the United States into pesos for their relatives
at home-at a hefty exchange rate differential. TV Azteca continued
to experience a modest growth in the ratings, until it hit on a
seemingly unbeatable combination: sex and violence-with an emphasis
on the violence-and political corruption.
 &HT;    And Salinas made a shrewd alliance with Argos Productions, a
company founded by a team of journalists, including Epigmenio
Ibarra, who reported the Central American wars, produced the first
lengthy televised interview with Subcomandante Marcos in January
1994, and whose independent production company was all over Chiapas
that summer directing videos of the Zapatistas.
 &HT;    Their first project, Nada Personal, changed the telenovela
formula. Instead of the traditional
poor-girl-falls-in-love-with-rich-man-and-lives-happily-ever-after,
story, Nada Personal started off with an unusual twist: Rich girl
meets handsome TV reporter when her father, the Attorney General,
and sister are murdered in a high-level narcopolitical conspiracy.
The fact that life is full of paradoxes and contradictions, lights
and shadows, may have been nothing new in Brazil and Colombia,
where novela writers have been borrowing from the seamier side of
reality for years, but in Mexico it was news. Nada Personal was an
instant hit, particularly since the writers and producers seemed to
be scrambling to include each morning's headlines in the evening's
show. Mexico's political life had turned into one giant telenovela,
in which the characters from one story kept getting mixed up in
another.
 &HT;    Fact and fiction really started to tumble together in July of
1996 , when The Miami Herald published a story linking Ricardo
Salinas to Raul (no relation) Salinas. Salinas Pliego first denied
that he had accepted money from the jailed brother of former
president, then later admitted that he had accepted a $29 million
loan, channeled through Panama and the Cayman Islands, that was
used to help pay for TV Azteca.
 &HT;    Salinas later explained the loan as ``irrelevant,'' and one that
he could hardly have questioned: ``If Raul Salinas] appeared and
said, 'I have this money and I want you to invest it for me, well,
very few people were going to say no to him,'' he told Proceso in
an interview.
 &HT;    Both networks engaged in a war of mutual allegations; TV Azteca
disclosed that Zabludovsky's son Abraham, a Televisa anchor, had
engaged in business dealings with Raul Salinas. Eventually, the
mutual accusations came to an end. But Ricardo Salinas remained on
the offensive. He has the unique distinction of having filed more
libel suits than anyone else in Mexico. According to the annual
report of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, he
``used lawsuits to squelch reporting linking him to a
money-laundering scheme.'' While a congressional investigation into
the privatization of TV Azteca was still pending, Salinas took out
newspaper advertisements announcing that the privatization of TV
Azteca was the most successful in Mexican history.
 &HT;    At a business forum sponsored by the Mexico City newspaper El
Economista, he gave a particularly upbeat performance, telling the
audience that the economic crisis was a matter of ``attitude.'' It
was up to each and every Mexican to look into his soul and
determine what he had done to cause the crisis. Elektra and TV
Azteca had succeeded because, unlike others, he didn't waste his
time brooding that ``Everything went down the tubes because of
Carlos Salinas.'' Less than a month later, congress concluded that
Salinas had won the 1993 bid because he made the best offer, and
the case was closed.
 &HT;    ``I'm not really sure that [Ricardo Salinas] could be
button-holed as the guy who had the most to gain from Raul
Salinas,'' says Robert Hulme, an analyst with Interacciones Casa de
Bolsa in New York. ``Raul ran with a bunch of Mexican businessmen.
I don't think investors perceive political intrigue as something
that comes to mind when they talk about Azteca ... it's not
something that investors are focusing on.'' ``It's a fact that
nobody talks about,'' explains another analyst, who asked not to be
named. ``The bottom line is he is a very good businessman, he is
defending shareholders' interest. That's really all you care
about.''
 &HT;    While analysts disagree about where Ricardo Salinas, TV Azteca
and Elektra are going next, they tend to agree about one thing.
Part of his success last year was due to the turmoil and change at
Televisa.
 &HT;    In April 1997, Televisa magnate Emilio Azcarraga Milmo died of
cancer, less than two months after stepping down and leaving the
world's largest Spanish-language media conglomerate in the hands of
his son, Emilio Azcarraga Jean, then 29. Azcarraga Jean was
considered a privileged ``junior'' and the company was plagued with
financial problems and personal squabbles that led to the defection
of two veteran executives who joined TV Azteca. Among them:
Guillermo Canedo White, Televisa's widely respected former CFO. But
Azcarraga Jean began to follow through with an ambitious
cost-cutting program and analysts and investors began to take
notice.
 &HT;    Despite the success of Mirada de Mujer, the telenovela that
broke even more taboos and presented a new image of contemporary
Mexican women, Televisa produced far more telenovelas than TV
Azteca. After veteran news anchor Jacobo Zabladovsky stepped down
in January and was replaced with Guillermo Ortega, Televisa's
nightly news program drew mixed reviews. But soon it was beating
Hechos in the ratings, and TV Azteca was forced to change the
timing of the news program, moving it up a half hour.
 &HT;    TV Azteca has a considerable dollar debt, drawing skepticism
from analysts such as Brian Barish with Cambiar Investments in
Denver. Barish isn't convinced by the the ``synergy'' message that
Salinas is pushing throughout the hemisphere.
 &HT;    ``It's been a higher-risk, higher-reward proposition,'' he says
of Azteca stock. ``They've gone a decent job operationally, but so
far, the market hasn't rewarded it one way or the other.'' And
while Salinas may say that he's outgrown Mexico, his companies very
much depend on what happens in the Mexican economy and market. If
concerns over a shrinking peso, falling oil prices and a
less-spectacular growth rate than originally predicted continue,
Azteca may feel the crunch. Unlike last year, broadcast networks
can't count on lavish spending for a federal electoral campaign or
a campaign to promote Afores, the privatized pension system that
debuted in 1997.
 &HT;    Then there's also the matter of the messy ``divorce'' with NBC
that is still clouding the picture.
 &HT;    NBCdid not return several phone calls asking for a comment for
this article, but according to Mexican media reports, NBC claims
that TV Azteca failed to disclose its intentions to go public and
therefore it was deprived of adequate knowledge of whether to
exercise its 10 percent option on time.
 &HT;    TV Azteca says that NBC never came through with the technical
and programming advice it had promised. NBC ``wasn't paying
attention,'' Steckel insists. ``They didn't read the contract ...
they ought to know how much the company is worth better than
anyone.'' Steckel says the Mexican network had no plans to carry
out an IPO when it did, but was forced to do so once the Sabas
decided to exercise their options and cash out their shares.
 &HT;    Currently before international arbitration, the case may
eventually depend on something as esoteric as the colors of the TV
Azteca-and NBC-logos.''That's not the NBC peacock,'' Steckel says
of his company's logo. ``That's an eagle, a soaring Mexican
eagle.'' TV Azteca hasn't set aside reserves for a potential
adverse ruling, claiming that the worst-case scenario may cost the
company $12 million and 2 percent of equity.
 &HT;    Now 77 and concerned primarily with the charitable foundation
named after her father, Irma Salinas observes the disputes about
peacocks and eagles, southern campaigns and northern divisions from
the distance in Monterrey. There were three things her brother Hugo
said he wanted to accomplish before he died, she says. And his
grandson has already accomplished two of them. And the third? Irma
Salinas can't remember. Or maybe she's just not saying.

next Carlos Slim, says Simpser; he could be ``The Big Kahuna.''
 &HT;    Even his staunchest critics grudgingly admit that Salinas has
managed to dramatically turn around both Elektra and TV Azteca, the
former state-run television network he bought five years ago. Now
he's turned his sights toward the rest of Latin America, as well as
to the lucrative Spanish-language market in the United States.
 &HT;    Salinas did not grant an interview for this article despite
several requests.
 &HT;    ``When we talk about our group of companies, we talk about
outgrowing Mexico,'' he told a group of analysts, fund managers and
potential investors last February at the Four Seasons in New York's
World Trade Center. ``That's not because we think we've gotten too
big for Mexico, but because our group's sales and cash flow have
tripled the growth of the Mexican economy.'' As performances, go,
Salinas's New York presentation, was only a slightly more subdued
version of his message in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    Hoopla and hype aside, these are the facts: Last year, total net
revenue of Elektra, TV Azteca, and a paging service called Biper
reached $1.3 billion. Net income totalled more than $220 million.
TV Azteca had the number one-ranked nightly news program in Mexico
and the number one telenovela (soap opera).
 &HT;    The network beat Mexican media giant Televisa at its own game
with Mirada de Mujer, featuring a 50-year-old woman who turns the
tables on her unfaithful husband and finds happiness with a much
younger man.
 &HT;    With just two channels compared with Televisa's four, TV Azteca
managed to capture 35 percent of the television audienceand nearly
as much of the advertising market. By the end of the year the
network was producing 85 percent of its prime time programming, up
from 36 percent in December 1995. Azteca officials insist that
they'll reach 100 percent in-house prime time production this year
and produce 10 novelas. Meanwhile, Salinas has opened stores in
Chile, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and the Dominican Republic.
 &HT;    As he travels south, Salinas pushes the total package-Elektra,
TV Azteca and Biper. So far, he has managed to buy two small
networks in Chile and El Salvador and a UHF channel in Guatemala, a
relatively modest expense compared with the production costs of
those 10 telenovelas.
 &HT;    In 1997, TV Azteca entered the world financial markets, raising
US$425 million in bonds and $605 million in its August IPO, the
largest public offering of a Mexican company since the December
1994 peso devaluation. Along with his international expansion,
Salinas has announced plans to create a holding company that would
combine TV Azteca with Elektra and its subsidiaries, the clothing
chain Hecali, Biper and credit and money-wire services. At the
outset, Salinas will hold about 40 percent of the shares, but
analysts predict he will soon buy out his relatives, just as he
bought out his Azteca partners, Alberto and Moises Saba Raffoul,
last year.
 &HT;    In addition, Salinas bid almost $300 million in a government
auction of radio-frequency licenses. He's betting that a ``fixed
wireless,'' low-cost phone service will be a sure winner in a
country with a teledensity of less than 10 percent. Finally, in
contrast to rival Televisa, pay network Multivision and their
global partners, Salinas is making a high-stakes bet on digital
television rather than DTH.
 &HT;    Just five years ago, when Salinas bought TV Azteca, ``people saw
him as a refrigerator or microwave salesman,'' says CFO Adrian
Steckel, who left an investment banking career at Dillon Reed to
join Azteca in 1994. Finance writers and analysts weren't paying
attention to a family of regiomontanos (men from business city
Monterrey in Northern Mexico) they considered second- or
third-tier, compared with the better known powers behind Mexican
companies such as Alfa, Visa and Vitro. (Salinas was born in Mexico
City in October 1955, but is usually referred to as a
regiomontano.)
 &HT;    What they weren't following was the criss-cross of Monterrey
business and family relationships, which can be as complicated as
those in a Russian novel-or Mexican telenovela.
 &HT;    His family got its start in business when Benjamin Salinas
teamed up with his brother-in-law Joel Rocha in 1907 to found what
would eventually become the department store chain of Salinas y
Rocha. In the 1950s, Benjamin's only son, Hugo, founded a company
called Elektra that manufactured televisions and radios. When the
Rochas ousted him from the department stores, he retaliated by
turning Elektra into a rival retail business. In 1981, Hugo's
grandson joined Elektra after graduating from the Monterrey Tec and
Tulane, and brief stints at Arthur Anderson and Grupo Visa. Ricardo
Salinas Pliego arrived just in time for the debt crisis that
devastated Elektra. He responded with the same formula he would
apply at TV Azteca: Cut costs and revamp technology. He also
changed the company's customer and merchandise base. Instead of
trying to be an all-purpose department store catering to the middle
class, it began to focus on low-income customers, people with
negligible purchasing power, who were able to buy basic household
appliances and furniture on extended - and hefty -credit plans.
 &HT;    In 1991, Salinas was named president and CEO of Elektra, which
went public two years later.
 &HT;    ``[Ricardo] is a more polished version of my brother, Hugo,''
says Ricardo's great-aunt Irma Salinas Rocha, a keen observer of
the social and business scene in Monterrey.
 &HT;    ``Hugo was a big risk taker,'' Salinas says of her only brother.
 &HT;    ``And so is Ricardo; he's building an empire ... I wouldn't want
to have to compete with him.''
 &HT;    Although he was considered a lightweight during the 1993
privatization process, his original partner was not. Francisco
Aguirre Gomez came from a family that owned and operated a
profitable group of radio stations. They also had experience with
the Azcarraga family and Televisa. After nearly 20 years of
petitioning, they were finally granted a television broadcast
concession in 1968, only to have President Luis Echeverria
orchestrate its nationalization several years later. With the 1993
sale, Francisco Aguirre had a chance at vindication, by bidding on
a media package that included the same television station his
family had lost. But just weeks before the bid was to be awarded,
he parted ways with Salinas Pliego for reasons that were never
explained except for cryptic references to ``differences in
temperament.'' At the last minute, Salinas replaced Francisco
Aguirre with two brothers, Alberto and Moises Saba Raffoul, whose
fortune derived from investments in the textile and petrochemical
industries.
 &HT;    When the bids were opened, their $640 million bid was 30 percent
higher than the next-highest bid. The man whose family had started
off manufacturing and later selling television sets was on his way
to becoming a media mogul.
 &HT;    Salinas told the newsmagazine Proceso that if Mexican viewers
were looking for an alternative to the pro-government stance of
Televisa, they would have to wait a little bit longer.
 &HT;    ``I didn't buy these channels to criticize the government,'' he
said. ``Besides, Mexico is not ready for democracy * Television is
mainly for entertainment and for women who stay at home.'' But
Salinas had big ideas and talked about negotiations with Brazil's
TV Globo, NBC, and with Silvio Berlusconi of Italy. He invested in
technology and extended the penetration of his two channels, 7 and
13, throughout Mexico. He hired a youthful, folksy anchor, Javier
Alatorre, for the nightly news program Hechos-another generation
and another style, compared with Jacobo Zabludovsky, the longtime
anchor of Televisa's 24 Horas. He hired the head of the
Encyclopedia Britannica, Sergio Sarmiento, also known for his
conservative economic commentary in print and radio journalism, to
direct Azteca's news division, and hired away other young
``talent'' in finance and accounting. (Steckel is 31) Azteca had
little to offer in the way of original programming, but managed to
attract attention by importing shows like The Simpsons and The
Wonder Years, considered unique at the time in Mexico. In 1994,
Azteca signed a highly publicized deal with NBC, described
glowingly by executives in Rockefeller Center as the network's
first post-NAFTA deal, ``a growth, growth, growth story.'' NBC
bought an option to purchase 10 percent of TV Azteca, and also
promised to provide technical advice. That summer, Mexican soccer
fans had an alternative to Televisa coverage of the World Cup, and
an estimated 40 percent of them tuned in to TV Azteca.
 &HT;    Elektra weathered the 1995 economic crisis with a boost from its
Western Union money transfer service that turned dollars earned by
Mexican workers in the United States into pesos for their relatives
at home-at a hefty exchange rate differential. TV Azteca continued
to experience a modest growth in the ratings, until it hit on a
seemingly unbeatable combination: sex and violence-with an emphasis
on the violence-and political corruption.
 &HT;    And Salinas made a shrewd alliance with Argos Productions, a
company founded by a team of journalists, including Epigmenio
Ibarra, who reported the Central American wars, produced the first
lengthy televised interview with Subcomandante Marcos in January
1994, and whose independent production company was all over Chiapas
that summer directing videos of the Zapatistas.
 &HT;    Their first project, Nada Personal, changed the telenovela
formula. Instead of the traditional
poor-girl-falls-in-love-with-rich-man-and-lives-happily-ever-after,
story, Nada Personal started off with an unusual twist: Rich girl
meets handsome TV reporter when her father, the Attorney General,
and sister are murdered in a high-level narcopolitical conspiracy.
The fact that life is full of paradoxes and contradictions, lights
and shadows, may have been nothing new in Brazil and Colombia,
where novela writers have been borrowing from the seamier side of
reality for years, but in Mexico it was news. Nada Personal was an
instant hit, particularly since the writers and producers seemed to
be scrambling to include each morning's headlines in the evening's
show. Mexico's political life had turned into one giant telenovela,
in which the characters from one story kept getting mixed up in
another.
 &HT;    Fact and fiction really started to tumble together in July of
1996 , when The Miami Herald published a story linking Ricardo
Salinas to Raul (no relation) Salinas. Salinas Pliego first denied
that he had accepted money from the jailed brother of former
president, then later admitted that he had accepted a $29 million
loan, channeled through Panama and the Cayman Islands, that was
used to help pay for TV Azteca.
 &HT;    Salinas later explained the loan as ``irrelevant,'' and one that
he could hardly have questioned: ``If Raul Salinas] appeared and
said, 'I have this money and I want you to invest it for me, well,
very few people were going to say no to him,'' he told Proceso in
an interview.
 &HT;    Both networks engaged in a war of mutual allegations; TV Azteca
disclosed that Zabludovsky's son Abraham, a Televisa anchor, had
engaged in business dealings with Raul Salinas. Eventually, the
mutual accusations came to an end. But Ricardo Salinas remained on
the offensive. He has the unique distinction of having filed more
libel suits than anyone else in Mexico. According to the annual
report of the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, he
``used lawsuits to squelch reporting linking him to a
money-laundering scheme.'' While a congressional investigation into
the privatization of TV Azteca was still pending, Salinas took out
newspaper advertisements announcing that the privatization of TV
Azteca was the most successful in Mexican history.
 &HT;    At a business forum sponsored by the Mexico City newspaper El
Economista, he gave a particularly upbeat performance, telling the
audience that the economic crisis was a matter of ``attitude.'' It
was up to each and every Mexican to look into his soul and
determine what he had done to cause the crisis. Elektra and TV
Azteca had succeeded because, unlike others, he didn't waste his
time brooding that ``Everything went down the tubes because of
Carlos Salinas.'' Less than a month later, congress concluded that
Salinas had won the 1993 bid because he made the best offer, and
the case was closed.
 &HT;    ``I'm not really sure that [Ricardo Salinas] could be
button-holed as the guy who had the most to gain from Raul
Salinas,'' says Robert Hulme, an analyst with Interacciones Casa de
Bolsa in New York. ``Raul ran with a bunch of Mexican businessmen.
I don't think investors perceive political intrigue as something
that comes to mind when they talk about Azteca ... it's not
something that investors are focusing on.'' ``It's a fact that
nobody talks about,'' explains another analyst, who asked not to be
named. ``The bottom line is he is a very good businessman, he is
defending shareholders' interest. That's really all you care
about.''
 &HT;    While analysts disagree about where Ricardo Salinas, TV Azteca
and Elektra are going next, they tend to agree about one thing.
Part of his success last year was due to the turmoil and change at
Televisa.
 &HT;    In April 1997, Televisa magnate Emilio Azcarraga Milmo died of
cancer, less than two months after stepping down and leaving the
world's largest Spanish-language media conglomerate in the hands of
his son, Emilio Azcarraga Jean, then 29. Azcarraga Jean was
considered a privileged ``junior'' and the company was plagued with
financial problems and personal squabbles that led to the defection
of two veteran executives who joined TV Azteca. Among them:
Guillermo Canedo White, Televisa's widely respected former CFO. But
Azcarraga Jean began to follow through with an ambitious
cost-cutting program and analysts and investors began to take
notice.
 &HT;    Despite the success of Mirada de Mujer, the telenovela that
broke even more taboos and presented a new image of contemporary
Mexican women, Televisa produced far more telenovelas than TV
Azteca. After veteran news anchor Jacobo Zabladovsky stepped down
in January and was replaced with Guillermo Ortega, Televisa's
nightly news program drew mixed reviews. But soon it was beating
Hechos in the ratings, and TV Azteca was forced to change the
timing of the news program, moving it up a half hour.
 &HT;    TV Azteca has a considerable dollar debt, drawing skepticism
from analysts such as Brian Barish with Cambiar Investments in
Denver. Barish isn't convinced by the the ``synergy'' message that
Salinas is pushing throughout the hemisphere.
 &HT;    ``It's been a higher-risk, higher-reward proposition,'' he says
of Azteca stock. ``They've gone a decent job operationally, but so
far, the market hasn't rewarded it one way or the other.'' And
while Salinas may say that he's outgrown Mexico, his companies very
much depend on what happens in the Mexican economy and market. If
concerns over a shrinking peso, falling oil prices and a
less-spectacular growth rate than originally predicted continue,
Azteca may feel the crunch. Unlike last year, broadcast networks
can't count on lavish spending for a federal electoral campaign or
a campaign to promote Afores, the privatized pension system that
debuted in 1997.
 &HT;    Then there's also the matter of the messy ``divorce'' with NBC
that is still clouding the picture.
 &HT;    NBCdid not return several phone calls asking for a comment for
this article, but according to Mexican media reports, NBC claims
that TV Azteca failed to disclose its intentions to go public and
therefore it was deprived of adequate knowledge of whether to
exercise its 10 percent option on time.
 &HT;    TV Azteca says that NBC never came through with the technical
and programming advice it had promised. NBC ``wasn't paying
attention,'' Steckel insists. ``They didn't read the contract ...
they ought to know how much the company is worth better than
anyone.'' Steckel says the Mexican network had no plans to carry
out an IPO when it did, but was forced to do so once the Sabas
decided to exercise their options and cash out their shares.
 &HT;    Currently before international arbitration, the case may
eventually depend on something as esoteric as the colors of the TV
Azteca-and NBC-logos.''That's not the NBC peacock,'' Steckel says
of his company's logo. ``That's an eagle, a soaring Mexican
eagle.'' TV Azteca hasn't set aside reserves for a potential
adverse ruling, claiming that the worst-case scenario may cost the
company $12 million and 2 percent of equity.
 &HT;    Now 77 and concerned primarily with the charitable foundation
named after her father, Irma Salinas observes the disputes about
peacocks and eagles, southern campaigns and northern divisions from
the distance in Monterrey. There were three things her brother Hugo
said he wanted to accomplish before he died, she says. And his
grandson has already accomplished two of them. And the third? Irma
Salinas can't remember. Or maybe she's just not saying.

 Por BARBARA BELEJACK 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO D.F. _ Fue un ano muy bueno, especialmente para los
empleados del Grupo Elektra, sus conyuges y los asociados
comerciales que se reunieron en el hotel MGM, en Las Vegas, en la
convencion anual de la empresa.
 &HT;    Entre las conferencias sobre neurolinguistica y los saltos a las
maquinas de juego, contemplaron boquiabiertos a la actriz de TV
Azteca Lucia Mendez, escucharon a Paty Chapoy, presentadora de un
programa de invitados de TV Azteca, y a Armando Manzanero, cantante
y compositor del tema musical de una telenovela de TV Azteca. Y
sobre todo, escucharon a la estrella del espectaculo, el hombre con
gafas de marca, elegantemente vestido, con barba gris y microfono
con auricular. Rodeado por coristas de Las Vegas y junto a un
gigantesco boton amarillo (el logo de Elektra), y convertido en un
autentico maestro de la motivacion, Ricardo Salinas Pliego les dijo
lo que ya sabian: 1997 fue un ano muy bueno y las cosas iban a
mejorar aun mas. AEn el Grupo Elektra si se puede!
 &HT;    A los 42 anos, el presidente y jefe operativo del Grupo Elektra
(la mayor cadena minorista de Mexico) y de TV Azteca, ha sido
descrito como un visionario brillante, arrogante y un poco cinico.
Que mas se puede decir de un multimillonario que descubrio como
vender cosas a la gente con un poder adquisitivo minimo, que dijo
que un prestamo de US$29 millones era ``irrelevante''? Que
actualmente esta complicado en un dificil divorcio comercial, una
batalla juridica estrechamente vigilada con el gigante
norteamericano de la television NBC?
 &HT;    Puede decirse que es un hombre que sabe como reorganizar una
compania y sacar ganancias. Hace tres anos, quien hubiera creido
que TV Azteca llegaria a controlar la tercera parte del mercado de
la television de Mexico?, se pregunta Leonardo Simpser, analista de
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell en la capital mexicana. Con su combinacion
de establecimientos minoristas, red de distribucion, credito y
tecnologia, Salinas podria absorber practicamente cualquier
negocio. Podria ser el proximo Carlos Slim, dice Simpser.
 &HT;    Hasta sus criticos mas implacables admiten a reganadientes que
Salinas ha logrado un cambio espectacular en Elektra y TV Azteca,
la cadena de television que le compro al Estado mexicano hace cinco
anos.
 &HT;    Ahora Salinas ha puesto los ojos en el resto de America Latina,
asi como en el lucrativo mercado en espanol de Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    No fue posible entrevistar a Salinas para este articulo, a pesar
de varias solicitudes al respecto.
 &HT;    ``Cuando hablamos de nuestro grupo de empresas, hablamos de
crecer mas que Mexico,'' expreso a un grupo de analistas, gerentes
de fondos e inversionistas potenciales en febrero, en el Four
Seasons del World Trade Center de Nueva York. ``Eso no es porque
pensamos que hemos llegado a ser demasiado grandes para Mexico,
sino porque las ventas y el flujo de efectivo de nuestro grupo han
superado en el triple el crecimiento de la economia mexicana.'' En
cuanto a interpretaciones, la presentacion de Salinas en Nueva York
solo fue una version mas discreta de su mensaje en Las Vegas.
 &HT;    Espectaculos aparte, estos son los hechos: el ano pasado, los
ingresos de Elektra, TV Azteca y un servicio de localizacion
electronica llamado Biper llegaron a US$1.300 millones. Las
ganancias sumaron mas de US$200 millones. TV Azteca tuvo el
noticiero nocturno numero uno de Mexico, y tambien la telenovela en
primer lugar en los indices de sintonia.
 &HT;    La cadena batio al gigante Televisa en su propio terreno con
Mirada de Mujer, donde una mujer de 50 anos deja a su esposo infiel
y encuentra la felicidad con un hombre mucho mas joven. Con solo
dos canales, frente a los cuatro de Televisa, TV Azteca logro
captar el 35 por ciento de la teleaudiencia y casi la misma
proporcion del mercado de la publicidad. Para fin de ano la cadena
producia el 85 por ciento de su programacion de la hora de mas
audiencia, 36 por ciento mas que en diciembre de 1995. Los
ejecutivos de Azteca afirman que este ano produciran el 100 por
ciento de sus programas de hora punta y 10 novelas. Entretanto,
Salinas ha abierto establecimientos en Chile, Guatemala, El
Salvador, Honduras y la Republica Dominicana. En su avance hacia el
sur, Salinas promociona el paquete completo: Elektra, TV Azteca y
Biper. Hasta ahora ha conseguido comprar dos cadenas pequenas en
Chile y El Salvador y un canal UHF en Guatemala, gasto
relativamente modesto en comparacion con los costos de produccion
de esas 10 telenovelas.
 &HT;    En 1997, TV Azteca entro en el mundo de los mercados financieros
y recaudo US$425 millones en deuda empresarial y US$605 millones en
su salida a bolsa en agosto, la mayor venta de acciones de una
compania mexicana desde la devaluacion del peso en diciembre de
1994. Junto con su expansion internacional, Salinas ha anunciado
planes de crear una compania holding que combinaria a TV Azteca con
Elektra y sus filiales, la cadena de ropa Hecali, Biper, asi como
servicios de credito y de giros. Al final, Salinas tendra
aproximadamente el 40 por ciento de las acciones, pero los
analistas pronostican que pronto comprara las acciones de sus
familiares, del mismo modo que compro las acciones en Azteca de sus
socios Alberto y Moises Saba Raffoul el ano pasado.
 &HT;    Ademas, Salinas ya ha ofrecido casi US$300 millones en una
licitacion gubernamental de licencias de frecuencias radiales. Esta
seguro de que un servicio telefonico inalambrico fijo a bajo costo
sera un exito seguro en un pais donde menos del 10 por ciento de la
poblacion tiene telefono. Por ultimo, a diferencia de su rival
Televisa, de la cadena de cable Multivision y de sus socios
internacionales, Salinas apuesta fuerte a la television digital y
no a la DTH.
 &HT;    Hace solo cinco anos, cuando Salinas compro TV Azteca, ``la
gente lo veia como un vendedor de refrigeradores o de hornos de
microonda,'' dice Adrian Steckel, director de finanzas, que dejo su
carrera en banca de inversion en Dillon Reed para pasarse a Azteca
en 1994. Los comentaristas y analistas financieros no prestaban
atencion entonces a una familia de Monterrey a la que consideraban
de segunda o tercera clase frente a los poderes mas conocidos en
empresas mexicanas como Alfa, Visa y Vitro. (Salinas nacio en
Mexico D.F. en octubre de 1955, pero casi siempre se le considera
de Monterrey, un regiomontano).
 &HT;    Lo que perdian de vista era los enredos de las relaciones
familiares y comerciales de Monterrey, que pueden ser tan
complicadas como las de una novela rusa o una telenovela mexicana.
 &HT;    Su familia entro en el mundo de los negocios cuando Benjamin
Salinas se asocio con su cunado Joel Rocha en 1907 para fundar lo
que llegaria a ser la cadena de tiendas por departamento de Salinas
y Rocha.
 &HT;    En los anos 50, el unico hijo de Benjamin, Hugo, fundo una
compania llamada Elektra que fabricaba televisores y radios. Cuando
los Rocha lo sacaron de las tiendas por departamento, se vengo
convirtiendo a Elektra en un negocio rival. En 1981, el nieto de
Hugo se unio a Elektra despues de graduarse del Instituto
Tecnologico de Monterrey y de la Universidad de Tulane, y de breves
periodos en Arthur Anderson y en Grupo Visa.
 &HT;    Ricardo Salinas Pliego llego justo a tiempo para la crisis de la
deuda que devasto a Elektra. Respondio con la misma formula que
aplicaria en TV Azteca: reducir costos y renovar la tecnologia.
Tambien cambio la base de clientes y de mercancias de la compania.
En vez de tratar de convertirla en una tienda por departamentos
dirigida a la clase media, comenzo a concentrarse en clientes de
ingresos bajos, personas con un poder adquisitivo insignificante,
capaces de comprar muebles y electrodomesticos basicos con planes
de credito extendidos y solidos.
 &HT;    En 1991, Salinas fue nombrado presidente ejecutivo de Elektra,
que salio a bolsa dos anos despues.
 &HT;    ``[Ricardo] es una version mas pulida de mi hermano, Hugo,''
dice la tia abuela de Ricardo, Irma Salinas Rocha, aguda
observadora del escenario social y comercial de Monterrey.
 &HT;    ``Hugo era muy arriesgado,'' dice Salinas de su unico hermano.
``Y Ricardo tambien: esta levantando un imperio* No quisiera tener
que competir con el.''
 &HT;    Aunque se le consideraba un peso ligero durante el proceso de
privatizacion de 1993, su socio original no despertaba la misma
opinion.
 &HT;    Francisco Aguirre Gomez procedia de una familia que era
propietaria y administraba un rentable grupo de estaciones
radiales. Tambien tuvieron experiencia con la familia Azcarraga y
con Televisa. Despues de pasar casi 20 anos haciendo solicitudes,
por fin recibieron una concesion de television en 1968, pero anos
despues el presidente Luis Echeverria nacionalizo el medio. Con la
venta de 1993, Francisco Aguirre tuvo una oportunidad de
reivindicacion al participar en la licitacion del paquete de medios
que contenia a la misma estacion de television que su familia habia
perdido. Pero solo unas semanas antes de que se otorgara la
concesion, rompio con Salinas Pliego por razones que solo se
explicaron con referencias cripticas a unas ``diferencias de
temperamento.'' A ultima hora, Salinas sustituyo a Francisco
Aguirre con dos hermanos, Alberto y Moises Saba Raffoul, cuya
fortuna procedia de inversiones en los sectores textil y
petroquimico. Cuando se abrieron las licitaciones, su oferta de
US$640 millones era el 30 por ciento mas alta que la segunda mayor.
El hombre cuya familia habia comenzado en la manufactura y mas
tarde se habia dedicado a vender televisores, iba en camino de
convertirse en un magnate de los medios.
 &HT;    Salinas expreso a la revista Proceso que si los televidentes
mexicanos buscaban una alternativa a la postura progubernamental de
Televisa tendrian que esperar un poco mas.
 &HT;    ``No compre esos canales para criticar al gobierno,'' dijo.
 &HT;    ``Ademas, Mexico no esta listo para la democracia* La television
es mayormente para entretenimiento y para las mujeres que se quedan
en casa.''
 &HT;    Pero Salinas tenia grandes ideas y hablo de negociaciones con la
brasilena TV Globo, con NBC y con Silvio Berlusconi, de Italia.
Invirtio en tecnologia y extendio la penetracion de sus dos
canales, el 7 y el 13, en todo Mexico. Contrato a un joven y
popular presentador, Javier Alatorre, para el noticiero de la
noche, Hechos, otra generacion y otro estilo frente a Jacobo
Zabludovsky, presentador durante mucho tiempo de 24 Horas, de
Televisa. Contrato al director de la Enciclopedia Britanica, Sergio
Sarmiento, tambien conocido por sus comentarios economicos
conservadores en la radio y la prensa escrita, para dirigir la
division de noticias de Azteca, y tambien acaparo a otros talentos
jovenes en finanzas y contabilidad (Steckel tiene 31 anos). Azteca
tenia poco que ofrecer en programacion original, pero logro atraer
la atencion importando programas como Los Simpson y The Wonder
Years, considerados unicos en ese momento en Mexico. En 1994,
Azteca firmo un acuerdo con NBC que recibio gran publicidad y que
los ejecutivos del Rockefeller Center vieron maravillados como el
primer acuerdo de la cadena despues del TLC, ``una historia de
crecimiento, crecimiento y crecimiento.'' NBC compro una opcion
para adquirir el 10 por ciento de TV Azteca, y tambien prometio
brindar asesoramiento tecnico. Ese verano, los fanaticos mexicanos
del futbol tuvieron una alternativa a la cobertura de Televisa de
la Copa Mundial, y un 40 por ciento de ellos sintonizo TV Azteca.
 &HT;    Elektra capeo la crisis economica de 1995 con un impulso del
servicio de transferencias de dinero de Western Union que convirtio
los dolares ganados por los trabajadores mexicanos en Estados
Unidos en pesos para sus parientes en el suelo natal, con un solido
diferencial en el tipo de cambio. TV Azteca siguio experimentando
un modesto crecimiento en los indices de audiencia, hasta que
adopto una combinacion al parecer invencible: sexo y violencia (con
enfasis en la violencia) y corrupcion politica.
 &HT;    Salinas hizo una astuta alianza con Argos Productions, compania
fundada por un equipo de periodistas, entre ellos Epigmenio Ibarra,
que cubrio las guerras en Centroamerica, produjo la primera
entrevista televisada de gran duracion con el subcomandante Marcos
en enero de 1994, y cuya compania productora independiente tuvo una
gran presencia en Chiapas ese verano, haciendo videos de los
zapatistas.
 &HT;    Su primer proyecto, Nada Personal, cambio la formula de las
telenovelas. En vez de la historia tradicional de la muchacha pobre
que se enamora del joven rico y terminan casandose, Nada Personal
presento un giro insolito: una joven rica conoce a un apuesto
reportero de la television cuando su padre, el secretario de
Justicia, y su hermana, mueren asesinados en una conspiracion
narcopolitica de alto nivel. El hecho que la vida esta llena de
paradojas y contradicciones, de luces y sombras, tal vez no era
nada nuevo en Brasil y Colombia, donde los novelistas se inspiran
desde hace muchos anos en el lado menos atractivo de la realidad,
pero en Mexico era novedoso. Nada Personal fue un exito
instantaneo, sobre todo desde que los escritores y productores
dieron la impresion de apresurarse por colocar los titulares de la
manana en el programa de la tarde. La vida politica de Mexico se
habia convertido en una gigantesca telenovela, en la cual los
personajes de una historia se mezclaban en otra.
 &HT;    La realidad y la ficcion amenazaron con desplomarse juntas en
julio de 1996, cuando The Miami Herald publico un articulo en el
que se vinculaba a Ricardo Salinas con Raul Salinas, entre los que
no hay lazos de sangre. Al principio Salinas Pliego nego haber
aceptado dinero del hermano del ex presidente Carlos Salinas, pero
luego admitio que habia aceptado un prestamo de US$29 millones,
canalizado a traves de Panama y las Islas Caiman, que se utilizo
para contribuir a pagar por TV Azteca.
 &HT;    Salinas dijo mas tarde que el prestamo era ``irrelevante'' y que
dificilmente pudiera haber sido cuestionado: ``Si Raul [Salinas]
llegaba y decia: 'Tengo este dinero y quisiera que me lo
invirtieran', bueno, pocas personas van a negarse,'' le expreso a
la revista Proceso en una entrevista.
 &HT;    Ambas cadenas iniciaron una guerra de acusaciones mutuas: TV
Azteca revelo que el hijo de Zabludovsky, Abraham, presentador de
Televisa, tenia negocios con Raul Salinas. Al final, las
acusaciones mutuas terminaron. Pero Ricardo Salinas se mantuvo a la
ofensiva. Tiene la distincion de ser el individuo que mas pleitos
judiciales ha presentado en Mexico. Segun el informe anual de la
Comision de Proteccion de los Periodistas, con sede en Nueva York,
Salinas ``uso litigios judiciales para silenciar los reportajes que
lo vinculaban con una operacion de lavado de dinero.''
 &HT;    Aunque estaba pendiente una investigacion parlamentaria sobre la
privatizacion de TV Azteca, Salinas publico anuncios en la prensa
diciendo que la privatizacion de TV Azteca era la mas exitosa de la
historia mexicana.
 &HT;    En un foro de negocios patrocinado por el periodico El
Economista, Salinas se mostro muy optimista y dijo al publico que
la crisis economica era una cuestion de ``actitud.'' Cada mexicano
debia hacer un examen de conciencia y determinar que habia hecho
para causar la crisis. Elektra y TV Azteca triunfaron porque, a
diferencia de otros, el no habia perdido tiempo quejandose de que
``Carlos Salinas nos puso a todos en el agujero.'' Menos de un mes
despues, el Congreso mexicano llego a la conclusion de que Salinas
habia ganado la licitacion de 1993 porque habia hecho la mejor
oferta, y el caso quedo cerrado.
 &HT;    ``No estoy seguro de que pueda senalarse a Ricardo Salinas como
el hombre que tenia mas que ganar de Raul Salinas,'' comenta Robert
Hulme, analista de Interacciones Casa de Bolsa en Nueva York.
``Raul era amigo de muchos empresarios mexicanos. No creo que a los
inversionistas les venga a la mente la intriga politica cuando
hablan de Azteca* no es algo en que los inversionistas se
concentran.''
 &HT;    ``Es un hecho del que nadie habla,'' explica otro analista, que
pidio no ser identificado. ``Lo esencial es que se trata de un gran
negociante, que defiende los intereses de los accionistas. En
realidad eso es lo que importa.''
 &HT;    Los analistas no se ponen de acuerdo en el rumbo que tomaran
Ricardo Salinas, TV Azteca y Elektra, pero si coinciden en que
parte del exito que tuvieron el ano pasado se debio al cambio y al
alboroto en Televisa.
 &HT;    En abril de 1997, el magnate de Televisa, Emilio Azcarraga
Milmo, murio de cancer, menos de dos meses despues de renunciar a
su puesto y dejar el mayor conglomerado de medios en espanol en
manos de su hijo, Emilio Azcarraga Jean, que entonces tenia 29
anos. A Azcarraga Jean se le consideraba un ``hijo de papa'' y la
empresa sufrio problemas financieros y diferencias personales que
llevaron a la salida de dos ejecutivos veteranos, que se pasaron a
TV Azteca. Entre ellos: Guillermo Canedo White, el respetado ex
director de finanzas de Televisa. Pero Azcarraga Jean puso en
marcha un ambicioso programa de reduccion de costos que llamo la
atencion de analistas e inversionistas.
 &HT;    A pesar del exito de Mirada de Mujer, la telenovela que rompio
mas tabues y presento una imagen nueva de la mujer mexicana de hoy,
Televisa produjo muchas mas telenovelas que TV Azteca. Despues que
el veterano presentador noticioso Jacobo Zabludovsky se retiro en
enero y lo sustituyo Guillermo Ortega, el noticiero nocturno de
Televisa recibio elogios y criticas. Pero no tardo en derrotar a
Hechos en los ratings, y TV Azteca tuvo que cambiar el horario de
su noticiero a media hora mas tarde.
 &HT;    TV Azteca tiene una considerable deuda en dolares, lo que ha
causado el escepticismo de analistas como Brian Barish, de Cambiar
Investments, en Denver. Barish no esta convencido del mensaje de
``sinergia'' que Salinas transmite a todo el hemisferio.
 &HT;    ``Ha sido una propuesta de grandes riesgos y grandes
recompensas,'' dice de las acciones de Azteca. ``Han hecho una
labor decente en el aspecto operativo, pero hasta ahora el mercado
no lo ha recompensado.'' Y aunque Salinas diga que ha crecido mas
que Mexico, sus companias dependen en gran medida de lo que ocurre
en la economia y en el mercado de Mexico. Si persisten las
inquietudes sobre una baja en el valor del peso y en el precio del
petroleo y una tasa de crecimiento menos espectacular que la
pronosticada originalmente, Azteca podria sufrir las consecuencias.
A diferencia del ano pasado, las cadenas de difusion no pueden
contar con grandes gastos para una campana electoral federal ni con
una campana para la promocion de Afores, el sistema de pensiones
privatizado que debuto en 1997.
 &HT;    Luego esta la cuestion del desastroso ``divorcio'' con NBC que
aun nubla el horizonte.
 &HT;    NBC no devolvio varias llamadas telefonicas para obtener sus
comentarios, pero segun la prensa mexicana, NBC afirma que TV
Azteca no revelo sus intenciones de salir a bolsa, lo que la privo
del conocimiento adecuado para saber si ejercia su opcion del 10
por ciento a tiempo.
 &HT;    TV Azteca dice que NBC nunca brindo el asesoramiento que habia
prometido. NBC ``no estaba prestando atencion,'' reitera Steckel.
``No leyeron el contrato*debian saber que la compania vale mas que
cualquier otra.''
 &HT;    Steckel dice que la cadena mexicana no tenia plans de salir a
bolsa cuando lo hizo, pero que se vio obligada una vez que los
hermanos Saba decidieron ejercer sus opciones y convertir sus
titulos en efectivo.
 &HT;    El caso, que en este momento esta en manos de un arbitraje
internacional, podria depender de algo tan esoterico como los
colores de TV Azteca y el logo de NBC. ``Ese no es el pavo real de
NBC,'' afirma Steckel sobre el logo de su empresa. ``Es un aguila,
un aguila mexicana.''
 &HT;    TV Azteca no ha separado reservas para cubrir las consecuencias
de una decision judicial en su contra, y dice que en el peor de los
casos le podria costar a la empresa US$12 millones y el 2 por
ciento de su capital.
 &HT;    Irma Salinas, ahora de 77 anos y que se dedica en lo fundamental
a la fundacion caritativa que lleva el nombre de su padre, observa
desde Monterrey las disputas entre un pavo real y un aguila.
 &HT;    Hay tres cosas que su hermano Hugo dijo que queria lograr antes
de morir, dice Irma. Y su nieto ya ha conseguido dos. Y la tercera?
Irma Salinas no puede recordar. O quizas si se acuerda pero no lo
quiere decir.

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO D.F. _ Fue un ano muy bueno, especialmente para los
empleados del Grupo Elektra, sus conyuges y los asociados
comerciales que se reunieron en el hotel MGM, en Las Vegas, en la
convencion anual de la empresa.
 &HT;    Entre las conferencias sobre neurolinguistica y los saltos a las
maquinas de juego, contemplaron boquiabiertos a la actriz de TV
Azteca Lucia Mendez, escucharon a Paty Chapoy, presentadora de un
programa de invitados de TV Azteca, y a Armando Manzanero, cantante
y compositor del tema musical de una telenovela de TV Azteca. Y
sobre todo, escucharon a la estrella del espectaculo, el hombre con
gafas de marca, elegantemente vestido, con barba gris y microfono
con auricular. Rodeado por coristas de Las Vegas y junto a un
gigantesco boton amarillo (el logo de Elektra), y convertido en un
autentico maestro de la motivacion, Ricardo Salinas Pliego les dijo
lo que ya sabian: 1997 fue un ano muy bueno y las cosas iban a
mejorar aun mas. AEn el Grupo Elektra si se puede!
 &HT;    A los 42 anos, el presidente y jefe operativo del Grupo Elektra
(la mayor cadena minorista de Mexico) y de TV Azteca, ha sido
descrito como un visionario brillante, arrogante y un poco cinico.
Que mas se puede decir de un multimillonario que descubrio como
vender cosas a la gente con un poder adquisitivo minimo, que dijo
que un prestamo de US$29 millones era ``irrelevante''? Que
actualmente esta complicado en un dificil divorcio comercial, una
batalla juridica estrechamente vigilada con el gigante
norteamericano de la television NBC?
 &HT;    Puede decirse que es un hombre que sabe como reorganizar una
compania y sacar ganancias. Hace tres anos, quien hubiera creido
que TV Azteca llegaria a controlar la tercera parte del mercado de
la television de Mexico?, se pregunta Leonardo Simpser, analista de
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell en la capital mexicana. Con su combinacion
de establecimientos minoristas, red de distribucion, credito y
tecnologia, Salinas podria absorber practicamente cualquier
negocio. Podria ser el proximo Carlos Slim, dice Simpser.
 &HT;    Hasta sus criticos mas implacables admiten a reganadientes que
Salinas ha logrado un cambio espectacular en Elektra y TV Azteca,
la cadena de television que le compro al Estado mexicano hace cinco
anos.
 &HT;    Ahora Salinas ha puesto los ojos en el resto de America Latina,
asi como en el lucrativo mercado en espanol de Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    No fue posible entrevistar a Salinas para este articulo, a pesar
de varias solicitudes al respecto.
 &HT;    ``Cuando hablamos de nuestro grupo de empresas, hablamos de
crecer mas que Mexico,'' expreso a un grupo de analistas, gerentes
de fondos e inversionistas potenciales en febrero, en el Four
Seasons del World Trade Center de Nueva York. ``Eso no es porque
pensamos que hemos llegado a ser demasiado grandes para Mexico,
sino porque las ventas y el flujo de efectivo de nuestro grupo han
superado en el triple el crecimiento de la economia mexicana.'' En
cuanto a interpretaciones, la presentacion de Salinas en Nueva York
solo fue una version mas discreta de su mensaje en Las Vegas.
 &HT;    Espectaculos aparte, estos son los hechos: el ano pasado, los
ingresos de Elektra, TV Azteca y un servicio de localizacion
electronica llamado Biper llegaron a US$1.300 millones. Las
ganancias sumaron mas de US$200 millones. TV Azteca tuvo el
noticiero nocturno numero uno de Mexico, y tambien la telenovela en
primer lugar en los indices de sintonia.
 &HT;    La cadena batio al gigante Televisa en su propio terreno con
Mirada de Mujer, donde una mujer de 50 anos deja a su esposo infiel
y encuentra la felicidad con un hombre mucho mas joven. Con solo

Chile y El Salvador y un canal UHF en Guatemala, gasto

su salida a bolsa en agosto, la mayor venta de acciones de una
compania mexicana desde la devaluacion del peso en diciembre de
1994. Junto con su expansion internacional, Salinas ha anunciado
planes de crear una compania holding que combinaria a TV Azteca con
Elektra y sus filiales, la cadena de ropa Hecali, Biper, asi como
servicios de credito y de giros. Al final, Salinas tendra
aproximadamente el 40 por ciento de las acciones, pero los
analistas pronostican que pronto comprara las acciones de sus
familiares, del mismo modo que compro las acciones en Azteca de sus
socios Alberto y Moises Saba Raffoul el ano pasado.
 &HT;    Ademas, Salinas ya ha ofrecido casi US$300 millones en una
licitacion gubernamental de licencias de frecuencias radiales. Esta
seguro de que un servicio telefonico inalambrico fijo a bajo costo
sera un exito seguro en un pais donde menos del 10 por ciento de la
poblacion tiene telefono. Por ultimo, a diferencia de su rival
Televisa, de la cadena de cable Multivision y de sus socios

primer acuerdo de la cadena despues del TLC, ``una historia de
crecimiento, crecimiento y crecimiento.'' NBC compro una opcion
para adquirir el 10 por ciento de TV Azteca, y tambien prometio
brindar asesoramiento tecnico. Ese verano, los fanaticos mexicanos
del futbol tuvieron una alternativa a la cobertura de Televisa de
la Copa Mundial, y un 40 por ciento de ellos sintonizo TV Azteca.
 &HT;    Elektra capeo la crisis economica de 1995 con un impulso del
servicio de transferencias de dinero de Western Union que convirtio
los dolares ganados por los trabajadores mexicanos en Estados
Unidos en pesos para sus parientes en el suelo natal, con un solido
diferencial en el tipo de cambio. TV Azteca siguio experimentando
un modesto crecimiento en los indices de audiencia, hasta que
adopto una combinacion al parecer invencible: sexo y violencia (con
enfasis en la violencia) y corrupcion politica.
 &HT;    Salinas hizo una astuta alianza con Argos Productions, compania
fundada por un equipo de periodistas, entre ellos Epigmenio Ibarra,
que cubrio las guerras en Centroamerica, produjo la primera
entrevista televisada de gran duracion con el subcomandante Marcos
en enero de 1994, y cuya compania productora independiente tuvo una
gran presencia en Chiapas ese verano, haciendo videos de los
zapatistas.
 &HT;    Su primer proyecto, Nada Personal, cambio la formula de las
telenovelas. En vez de la historia tradicional de la muchacha pobre
que se enamora del joven rico y terminan casandose, Nada Personal
presento un giro insolito: una joven rica conoce a un apuesto
reportero de la television cuando su padre, el secretario de
Justicia, y su hermana, mueren asesinados en una conspiracion
narcopolitica de alto nivel. El hecho que la vida esta llena de
paradojas y contradicciones, de luces y sombras, tal vez no era
nada nuevo en Brasil y Colombia, donde los novelistas se inspiran
desde hace muchos anos en el lado menos atractivo de la realidad,
pero en Mexico era novedoso. Nada Personal fue un exito
instantaneo, sobre todo desde que los escritores y productores
dieron la impresion de apresurarse por colocar los titulares de la
manana en el programa de la tarde. La vida politica de Mexico se
habia convertido en una gigantesca telenovela, en la cual los
personajes de una historia se mezclaban en otra.
 &HT;    La realidad y la ficcion amenazaron con desplomarse juntas en
julio de 1996, cuando The Miami Herald publico un articulo en el
que se vinculaba a Ricardo Salinas con Raul Salinas, entre los que
no hay lazos de sangre. Al principio Salinas Pliego nego haber
aceptado dinero del hermano del ex presidente Carlos Salinas, pero
luego admitio que habia aceptado un prestamo de US$29 millones,
canalizado a traves de Panama y las Islas Caiman, que se utilizo
para contribuir a pagar por TV Azteca.
 &HT;    Salinas dijo mas tarde que el prestamo era ``irrelevante'' y que
dificilmente pudiera haber sido cuestionado: ``Si Raul [Salinas]
llegaba y decia: 'Tengo este dinero y quisiera que me lo
invirtieran', bueno, pocas personas van a negarse,'' le expreso a
la revista Proceso en una entrevista.
 &HT;    Ambas cadenas iniciaron una guerra de acusaciones mutuas: TV
Azteca revelo que el hijo de Zabludovsky, Abraham, presentador de
Televisa, tenia negocios con Raul Salinas. Al final, las
acusaciones mutuas terminaron. Pero Ricardo Salinas se mantuvo a la
ofensiva. Tiene la distincion de ser el individuo que mas pleitos
judiciales ha presentado en Mexico. Segun el informe anual de la
Comision de Proteccion de los Periodistas, con sede en Nueva York,
Salinas ``uso litigios judiciales para silenciar los reportajes que
lo vinculaban con una operacion de lavado de dinero.''
 &HT;    Aunque estaba pendiente una investigacion parlamentaria sobre la
privatizacion de TV Azteca, Salinas publico anuncios en la prensa
diciendo que la privatizacion de TV Azteca era la mas exitosa de la
historia mexicana.
 &HT;    En un foro de negocios patrocinado por el periodico El
Economista, Salinas se mostro muy optimista y dijo al publico que
la crisis economica era una cuestion de ``actitud.'' Cada mexicano
debia hacer un examen de conciencia y determinar que habia hecho
para causar la crisis. Elektra y TV Azteca triunfaron porque, a
diferencia de otros, el no habia perdido tiempo quejandose de que
``Carlos Salinas nos puso a todos en el agujero.'' Menos de un mes
despues, el Congreso mexicano llego a la conclusion de que Salinas
habia ganado la licitacion de 1993 porque habia hecho la mejor
oferta, y el caso quedo cerrado.
 &HT;    ``No estoy seguro de que pueda senalarse a Ricardo Salinas como
el hombre que tenia mas que ganar de Raul Salinas,'' comenta Robert
Hulme, analista de Interacciones Casa de Bolsa en Nueva York.
``Raul era amigo de muchos empresarios mexicanos. No creo que a los
inversionistas les venga a la mente la intriga politica cuando
hablan de Azteca* no es algo en que los inversionistas se
concentran.''
 &HT;    ``Es un hecho del que nadie habla,'' explica otro analista, que
pidio no ser identificado. ``Lo esencial es que se trata de un gran
negociante, que defiende los intereses de los accionistas. En
realidad eso es lo que importa.''
 &HT;    Los analistas no se ponen de acuerdo en el rumbo que tomaran
Ricardo Salinas, TV Azteca y Elektra, pero si coinciden en que
parte del exito que tuvieron el ano pasado se debio al cambio y al
alboroto en Televisa.
 &HT;    En abril de 1997, el magnate de Televisa, Emilio Azcarraga
Milmo, murio de cancer, menos de dos meses despues de renunciar a
su puesto y dejar el mayor conglomerado de medios en espanol en
manos de su hijo, Emilio Azcarraga Jean, que entonces tenia 29
anos. A Azcarraga Jean se le consideraba un ``hijo de papa'' y la
empresa sufrio problemas financieros y diferencias personales que
llevaron a la salida de dos ejecutivos veteranos, que se pasaron a
TV Azteca. Entre ellos: Guillermo Canedo White, el respetado ex
director de finanzas de Televisa. Pero Azcarraga Jean puso en
marcha un ambicioso programa de reduccion de costos que llamo la
atencion de analistas e inversionistas.
 &HT;    A pesar del exito de Mirada de Mujer, la telenovela que rompio
mas tabues y presento una imagen nueva de la mujer mexicana de hoy,
Televisa produjo muchas mas telenovelas que TV Azteca. Despues que
el veterano presentador noticioso Jacobo Zabludovsky se retiro en
enero y lo sustituyo Guillermo Ortega, el noticiero nocturno de
Televisa recibio elogios y criticas. Pero no tardo en derrotar a
Hechos en los ratings, y TV Azteca tuvo que cambiar el horario de
su noticiero a media hora mas tarde.
 &HT;    TV Azteca tiene una considerable deuda en dolares, lo que ha
causado el escepticismo de analistas como Brian Barish, de Cambiar
Investments, en Denver. Barish no esta convencido del mensaje de
``sinergia'' que Salinas transmite a todo el hemisferio.
 &HT;    ``Ha sido una propuesta de grandes riesgos y grandes
recompensas,'' dice de las acciones de Azteca. ``Han hecho una
labor decente en el aspecto operativo, pero hasta ahora el mercado
no lo ha recompensado.'' Y aunque Salinas diga que ha crecido mas
que Mexico, sus companias dependen en gran medida de lo que ocurre
en la economia y en el mercado de Mexico. Si persisten las
inquietudes sobre una baja en el valor del peso y en el precio del
petroleo y una tasa de crecimiento menos espectacular que la
pronosticada originalmente, Azteca podria sufrir las consecuencias.
A diferencia del ano pasado, las cadenas de difusion no pueden
contar con grandes gastos para una campana electoral federal ni con
una campana para la promocion de Afores, el sistema de pensiones
privatizado que debuto en 1997.
 &HT;    Luego esta la cuestion del desastroso ``divorcio'' con NBC que
aun nubla el horizonte.
 &HT;    NBC no devolvio varias llamadas telefonicas para obtener sus
comentarios, pero segun la prensa mexicana, NBC afirma que TV
Azteca no revelo sus intenciones de salir a bolsa, lo que la privo
del conocimiento adecuado para saber si ejercia su opcion del 10
por ciento a tiempo.
 &HT;    TV Azteca dice que NBC nunca brindo el asesoramiento que habia
prometido. NBC ``no estaba prestando atencion,'' reitera Steckel.
``No leyeron el contrato*debian saber que la compania vale mas que
cualquier otra.''
 &HT;    Steckel dice que la cadena mexicana no tenia plans de salir a
bolsa cuando lo hizo, pero que se vio obligada una vez que los
hermanos Saba decidieron ejercer sus opciones y convertir sus
titulos en efectivo.
 &HT;    El caso, que en este momento esta en manos de un arbitraje
internacional, podria depender de algo tan esoterico como los
colores de TV Azteca y el logo de NBC. ``Ese no es el pavo real de
NBC,'' afirma Steckel sobre el logo de su empresa. ``Es un aguila,
un aguila mexicana.''
 &HT;    TV Azteca no ha separado reservas para cubrir las consecuencias
de una decision judicial en su contra, y dice que en el peor de los
casos le podria costar a la empresa US$12 millones y el 2 por
ciento de su capital.
 &HT;    Irma Salinas, ahora de 77 anos y que se dedica en lo fundamental
a la fundacion caritativa que lleva el nombre de su padre, observa
desde Monterrey las disputas entre un pavo real y un aguila.
 &HT;    Hay tres cosas que su hermano Hugo dijo que queria lograr antes
de morir, dice Irma. Y su nieto ya ha conseguido dos. Y la tercera?
Irma Salinas no puede recordar. O quizas si se acuerda pero no lo
quiere decir.

3 MACARTHUR FELLOWS ARE ADDING VALUE TO THE WORLD OF MONEY  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 14)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., Mass.)  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year since 1981, it has been a cross between a Pulitzer
and a lottery: the fellowship program of the John D. and Catherine
T. MacArthur Foundation, which awards sizable, no-strings-attached
grants to a diverse group of creative thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   To choose recipients, the foundation uses a confidential group
of nominators and a selection committee. Earlier this month, the
foundation announced 29 such fellows _ receiving grants to be paid
out over five years that ranged from $220,000 to $375,000,
depending on the recipient's age.
</P>
<P>
   Among the winners were three whose work involves innovative
perspectives on money matters: a rancher who has taken steps to
preserve his Southwestern way of life; a geographer who studies how
labor and political issues help mold a cultural landscape, and an
economist who aims to apply the ideals of feminism and the left to
calculations of productivity.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth-generation cattle rancher in the Southwestern border
town of Douglas, Ariz., William McDonald is still recovering from
the shock of being recognized by the MacArthur Foundation, let
alone being awarded $285,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Malpai Borderlands Group, an organization he helped found in
1992, was intended, he said, to find common ground among ranchers,
environmentalists, government and just about anyone else with an
interest in Western lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see the handwriting on the wall,'' said McDonald, 46,
who has 350 head of cattle on 21,000 acres in and around Douglas,
in the southeastern part of the state, near both the Mexico border
and the New Mexico state line. ``We are concerned about what our
children would deal with as ranchers. Western ranchers who lease
land were seen as environmental `despoilers.' We're also dealing
with an increasingly harsh regulatory atmosphere. Development was
gobbling up areas where open space was and is.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald and his group of 20 other landowners in Arizona and New
Mexico saw everything they held dear as equally threatened _ from
the region's jaguars, an endangered species, to the area's ranching
community and the open space and grasslands on which it depends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to work through the tough issues that tend to
divide us in the West _ grazing fees, endangered species, growth,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group's members say that to maintain their way of life,
ranchers must join with environmentalists, onetime adversaries, to
protect the area from development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cattle market has been depressed for some time, and the
cost of land is such that you can't buy a ranch and pay for it with
the cattle, so you have to get another job,'' McDonald said. ``Or
sometimes people get stuck with inheritance taxes they can't afford
or younger generations lose interest in ranching. These things
cause the owners to sell and subdivide their land, and that raises
the value of the surrounding land, and it just feeds on itself from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In one initiative, some members of the group have signed on for
``grassbanking.'' The arrangement permits one rancher's cattle to
graze on a nearby range so that the grasses do not become
overgrazed and the land can regain its natural state. In return,
the rancher signs a ``conservation easement,'' held by the Malpai
board, prohibiting subdivision of his land in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   Members have also moved cattle around to maintain vegetation in
certain areas, and avoided ranching in areas where there are
endangered species. And members have helped the Nature Conservancy
buy land to remove it from the reach of development.
</P>
<P>
   In another initiative, the Malpai group is trying to develop a
``unique product that people would like to eat,'' McDonald said.
``There will be some reward to the producer who tries to do it
right _ by using animals raised in a friendly manner, and that
would then lift the economic situation for some of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, such a venture is not essential to the group's
mission. ``Ranchers don't need to be wealthy,'' he said. ``They
just love the way of life. It's enough to make a living with
assurances that they can make one in the future.''
</P>

   ``Mansfield Park,'' by Jane Austen, contains a passage of
special significance to Don Mitchell, 36, a cultural geographer at
Syracuse University who has just won a $235,000 grant for his work
on how human activity influences the natural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, when Rushworth vows to improve his home at
Southerton Court but wonders who will help, Miss Bertram chimes in:
``Your best friend upon such an occasion would be Repton, I
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Repton was Humphrey Repton, a famous English landscape gardener
who lived at the turn of the 18th century and laid out the gardens
and parks surrounding many great country houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repton is a fascinating figure who illustrates how human
aesthetic sense and wealth can be part of the process of
constructing the space we live in,'' Mitchell said last week in a
phone conversation from Scotland where he was visiting the parents
of his wife, Susan Millar, who is also a geography professor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's specialty is the influence of political conflict on
the landscape. In ``The Lie of the Land: Migrant Workers and the
Californian Landscape'' (University of Minnesota Press, 1996), he
explored how the endless struggles between big farming interests
and migrant workers shaped the state's agricultural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the land looks today is the result of these debates
and arguments,'' he said in the phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he pointed to the labor camps built for migrant
workers in California's central valley after the strikes of 1933
and 1934 because authorities feared a social explosion if the
farmers failed to improve conditions for their help. ``You only
find decent living and washing facilities where the workers were
militant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As other examples of the way social or political conflicts can
shape a landscape, Mitchell cites Tompkins Square Park in
Manhattan's East Village and the People's Park near the campus of
the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Both parks, he said, are products of long political battles
among various interests, including city and university bureaucrats,
local residents, environmentalists and advocates of the rights of
homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a result has been a space that now serves the needs
of local residents, while in Berkeley the university constructed a
park where it had originally planned to build dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, born in Walnut Creek, Calif., came to Syracuse
University in 1997 from the University of Colorado in Boulder,
where he had taught since gaining a doctorate in geography from
Rutgers University in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no firm idea yet how he would spend his award:
``I'm not an entrepreneur. I like teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   But he would like to assemble a team of geographers and
historians to write what he calls ``a people's geography of the
United States,'' which would chart the development of Americans'
``social relationship with their landscape.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Nancy Folbre has made a career as a feminist and an economist _
and of showing that the two titles are not mutually exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Since earning her doctorate in economics at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst in 1979, Ms. Folbre, 45, has focused much
of her research on nonmarket work, like child-rearing and caring
for elderly relatives. She contends that these unpaid roles, often
filled by women, should be included when determining a nation's
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Folbre, now a professor at the university, defines this and
other ``care work'' _ like teaching and nursing _ as largely
``first-name-basis'' jobs that involve helping others in a close
way. Because such work is not valued economically, ``care is being
driven out of business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What results is more than just a scarcity of people to fill
those unpaid and underpaid roles, but, she argues, a reduction in
the quality of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of progress in getting people to recognize
the worth of quantitative work,'' she said. ``But also, what is the
quality of it? Is it rich, is it careful, is it high quality?
Economists should care about quality as much as quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurses, for example, say they have so many patients that ``they
no longer have time on their job to hold people's hands,'' she
said. She likens this ``public good'' to a clean environment:
``Everyone enjoys and benefits from it, but it's hard to get people
to actually pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the $280,000 award came while she was in Europe
attending a conference of the International Association for
Feminist Economics, a group she helped found. The European Union
and other nations already have plans to survey the worth of
nonmarket work; in that regard, she said, ``the United States is
lagging behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Folbre said she would use some of the grant to support the
Center for Popular Economics, a nonprofit group where she is a
staff economist that runs workshops for advocates of social change.
Its mission of economic literacy is in accord with her conviction
that an economy can be changed at the grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't bother,'' she said. In
fact, her first project with the windfall will not be a scholarly
work but a revision of her popular book, ``The New Field Guide to
the U.S. Economy'' (New Press, 1995) a cartoon-enhanced review
meant to provide intellectual ammunition for people with a liberal
bent.
</P>
<P>
   Such individuals, she said wryly, need to be able to refute
comments like `` `That's very nice and very sweet but that's not
efficient; we can't compete in a global economy if we spend money
on health care and education and welfare.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Folbre said: ``It's important to give people a vocabulary of
economics to be able to engage in debate.'' &QL;

FERRARO ACCEPTED $20,000 FEE FROM PHILIP MORRIS, DOCUMENTS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JAMES DAO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, who is seeking the
Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate from New York, accepted a
$20,000 speaking honorarium from Philip Morris Cos. last year,
according to financial disclosure forms made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The payment was for a debate in February 1997 between Ferraro
and Robert Novak, one of her regular opponents on CNN's
``Crossfire'' program, before Philip Morris executives in Palm
Beach, Fla. Ferraro provided the liberal commentary on
``Crossfire'' until stepping down in January to campaign full-time.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro's disclosure, which she was required to make under
congressional ethics rules, could harm her among Democratic primary
voters who many politicians believe are angry with the tobacco
industry. It could also make it harder for her to attack Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, the Republican incumbent, over the $56,200 in
contributions he has received from the tobacco industry since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Public Advocate Mark Green, who is also seeking
the Democratic nomination, seized on the honorarium to assert that
it was wrong for Ferraro ``to profit politically or personally from
tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to ask yourself what she was thinking to take
$20,000 in tobacco money at a time when Democrats from President
Clinton to congressman Waxman to me locally were trying to crack
down on the industry for addicting children,'' Green said in a
statement, referring to Rep. Henry Waxman of California, a
proponent of anti-tobacco legislation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro campaign manager David Eichenbaum responded by saying:
``Gerry is staunchly in favor of the anti-tobacco legislation now
in Congress. She is strongly for raising the tax on cigarettes. If
her position were different from that, it would be one thing. But
the fact that she has taken such a strong position against the
interests of the tobacco industry makes this a nonissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's attack represented the latest bit of sniping among the
Democratic Senate candidates, a trend Democratic Party leaders
worry will escalate into full-fledged intraparty strife before the
primary season ends, even though the candidates have pledged to
avoid personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The third Democratic candidate, Rep. Charles Schumer, who
represents Brooklyn and Queens, declined to comment on Ferraro's
honorarium, as did D'Amato. Still, Green's attack could clearly
benefit both Schumer and D'Amato by undermining Ferraro, who is
widely considered the Democratic front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   The incident also showed that Ferraro's personal finances are
likely to be major issues throughout the campaign. That was also
the case when she lost the Democratic Senate primary in 1992; her
opponents then focused on the real estate dealings of her husband,
John Zaccaro.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro helped rekindle the debate over her finances by
restricting public review of her 1997 tax returns earlier this
year, allowing reporters just three hours to study the complex
documents and refusing to make copies available. Green and Schumer
handed out copies of their returns, though D'Amato did not.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro accepted the Philip Morris honorarium at a time when
Democrats across the country, as well as some Republicans, had
begun attacking the tobacco industry's marketing practices and
demanding that it pay for health costs relating to smoking. Many
Democrats are expected to campaign against the tobacco industry
this fall; indeed, Ferraro, Green and Schumer have all pledged not
to accept any contributions from the industry's political action
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic strategists said the payment would hurt Ferraro
among traditionally liberal Democratic primary voters. ``They are
anti-tobacco,'' said Philip Friedman, a strategist who works for
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The honorarium was listed in financial disclosure forms that all
incumbents and candidates for Congress are required to file
annually. Schumer's report showed that he had assets worth $238,000
to $560,000 and received no honorariums last year. Green received
an extension on his report, saying he needed extra time because he
had just filed his city disclosure report. &QL;

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 14, will move Saturday in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   RAPE-REVIEW _ They strike without warning, bringing terror to an
Algerian apartment, a Chinese shophouse in Indonesia, a squalid
refugee encampment in Africa or a Balkans farming village under
siege. They are shadowy men with a cause so blinding and a hatred
so deep that they have transformed modern warfare into orgies of
primordial savagery _ raping, brutalizing, humiliating, slashing
and hacking women and girls to death. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-REVIEW _ More than two years before Election Day, polls say
a Republican front-runner in the 2000 presidential race has already
emerged. He is a one-term governor, George W. Bush, who has never
run for national office but has, according to one recent poll,
already overtaken Vice President Al Gore, the popular Democrat who
has been running for the White House for 20 years. By Adam
Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-CONSERVATIVES-REVIEW _ If you want to know what is
wrong with the movie business, just ask Lionel Chetwynd. Chetwynd
has written the scripts for more than a dozen successful movies and
says he has been frustrated in his efforts to take his career a
step higher. The problem is not quality, he argued _ his films like
``The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz'' and ``Kissinger and Nixon''
have won widespread praise. No, he insisted, the barrier is his
beliefs: Chetwynd is a conservative. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-REVIEW _ Nigeria's new general-in-charge, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, in his first speech since the sudden death on
Monday of iron-fisted Gen. Sani Abacha, hammered away at the theme
of unshaken adherence to his country's ``international
commitments'' as he sought to comfort allies and serve notice of
his country's resolve to potential foes. By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-CHINA-REVIEW _ President Clinton's visit to China,
scheduled to begin June 25, is likely to be about appearances more
than anything else. No real diplomatic breakthrough looks possible,
since the United States and China remain far apart on key issues
like Taiwan and human rights. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   BAPTISTS-REVIEW _ The conspiracy theorists have it all wrong.
The U.S. government is not run by Freemasons. Or by the pope or
Jewish bankers. The American people are entitled to the truth: the
government is run by Southern Baptists, who were recently in the

   COLLEGE-POLLS-REVIEW _ They do not have the academic cachet of a
Harvard, nor will they forever be identified with winning one for
the Gipper like Notre Dame. But many unsung schools, including
those with tongue-curling names like Quinnipiac College, have
discovered a sly way to get themselves better known. They poll. By

there is no way to do a controlled experiment. By George Johnson.

   TALENTED-IMMIGRANTS-REVIEW _ Yoko Ono is one and so was John
Lennon. Alan Cumming, the Scottish star of Broadway's ``Cabaret''
and a Tony award winner, is one, too. Orlando Hernandez, the
Cuban-born pitching ace for the Yankees known as ``El Duque,''
became one just recently. All are or were ``aliens with
extraordinary ability.'' Despite its sound of chest-out,
fists-on-the-hip braggadocio, the phrase is not a description of an
especially poised visitor from another planet, but a government
classification of a distinguished, and human, immigrant. By Anthony
Ramirez.

   NUCLEAR-STATION-REVIEW _ In the history of bad decisions, the
Shoreham Nuclear Power Station stands out, a single project that
has polarized the politics of Long Island, N.Y., for a generation,
boosted electric rates high enough to repel industry for miles

and thousands of skilled craftsmen for more than a decade and
sucked more than $5.5 billion out of the economy. By Matthew L.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Rick Worley of Houston broke a world record for
marathon racing last weekend, and all he got was a medal for
finishing the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Worley said, ``it was a medal and a lot of
satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   When Worley finished the South Bend, Ind., Sunburst Marathon on
June 6, it marked the 75th consecutive weekend he had finished at
least one race of 26 miles, 385 yards. He has run two marathons in
the same weekend on 12 occasions, meaning he has run better than
2,200 miles since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But that number pales in comparison to the travel time it has
taken Worley to get from race to race. His 75-week string includes
at least one race in each of the 50 states plus the District of
Columbia. And he isn't stopping now.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the year's end, I will have run 104 straight weeks and in
126 marathons,'' he said. ``I haven't been home for a weekend since
Dec. 28, 1996. If President Clinton were to drive by my lawn, he'd
declare it a national disaster area.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Worley, 51, is setting the world on fire with his
times; he generally finishes in more than four hours in an effort
to avoid injuries. He runs not only for himself but for the Worley
Marathon Scholarship Fund, which thus far has raised $6,000 for Cal
Farley Boys Ranch near Amarillo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if I was going to do this, it might as well mean
something,'' Worley said. ``We've funded three-plus scholarships
there, which are $1,800 each.''
</P>
<P>
   Worley, an executive with Houston's Mieco Oil Co., ran nine
marathons from 1982 through 1984 before suffering a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   He set a goal of getting back into shape to run the Houston
Marathon at age 40, in 1987. He planned to run another marathon
when he was 50 and another when he was 60 ``for something to tell
the grandkids.''
</P>
<P>
   But at 50, as he prepared to run the 1997 Houston Marathon, he
saw an article about someone who celebrated turning 50 by running
50 marathons in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that made me only wanting to run my one marathon
when I turned 50 look kind of cheesy,'' he said. ``In baseball,
they have the 40-40 club. I thought, `What about a 50-50 club?'''
</P>
<P>
   So on Jan. 5, 1997, one week before the Houston Marathon, he ran
in the Disney World Marathon at Orlando, Fla. Then during the
Houston race, he saw people wearing T-shirts from the 50 &AMP; D.C.
Marathon Group USA Club. Its members set a goal to run a marathon
in each state as well as the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Worley then modified his goal to run a marathon in each of the
50 states and Washington, D.C., in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times, he had to run two marathons in the same weekend
because some states had only one race a year. But on Dec. 13, 1997,
he ran in the Rocket City Marathon in Huntsville, Ala., to complete
his goal, which was certified by the 50 &AMP; D.C. Marathon Group USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took only 47 weeks and a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he finished the South Bend race for his 75th consecutive
weekend marathon, he broke the world record of 74 held by Gordon
Hartshorn of The Colony, a Denton County suburb of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Worley's fastest time in the 75-weekend streak was 4:01 in South
Bend. His career best is 3:29 at Houston in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of his most interesting moments came last year on a cruise
ship to Alaska, when Worley was traveling to participate in the
Mayor's Midnight Sun Marathon in Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   During the trip, Worley and his girlfriend, Dee Stone, met Jim
Thompson, a vice president with Atlanta Freight Liner in Georgia.
Thompson was mesmerized by Worley's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had participated in 23 or 24 marathons at that time, and I
told him that when I had run in enough marathons to become
credible, I would want to seek money for the Cal Farley Boys
Ranch,'' Worley said. ``He said, `You don't have to wait until your
first 30. You have a sponsor now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Worley is a native of Canadian in the Texas Panhandle, and he
moved to Amarillo at an early age. He graduated from Tascosa High
School and West Texas State before the oil business brought him to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While at Tascosa, he was on the high school wrestling team.
There was only one school against whose wrestlers he never won _
the Boys Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to go the distance for his old rivals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How long will the string continue? The end is in sight, Worley
said. But not before he performs his own version of the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to run in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia,
all 12 Canadian provinces and territories, as well as a November
run in Cozumel, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he will choose the time to hang up the sneakers. After
December, he said he will pick a race and retire with the same
hoopla he had when he broke the world marathon record _ just a
medal for finishing the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there will still be a lot of satisfaction,'' he said.
</P>

 By CHARLES W. THURSTON 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Being the big fish in a small pond has its pleasures.
That so far has been the experience of U.S. airlines opening routes
in recently deregulated skies over Latin America.
 &HT;    In Central America _ the first region to agree to ``open
skies,'' which allows carriers from member countries to freely set
frequencies and aircraft capacity on international routes _ U.S.
carriers American, Continental and United are blanketing the region
with flights. Now Delta Air Lines is expanding in Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala and Panama, thanks to the ease of entry.
 &HT;    Delta CEO Leo Mullin crows the common logic among U.S. airline
executives: ``Passengers pursuing business and leisure
opportunities ... won't accept artificial barriers to their travel.
This unrelenting pressure ... for access and ease ... at
competitive prices will propel nations towards liberalized air
treaties.'' However, the rhetoric of open skies has gone from a
shiny truth to a fuzzy semi-reality, even as regional air traffic
takes off. Some 26 million passengers traveled between the United
States and Latin America in 1990; by 2001, U.S. consultants
Aviation Management Services projects that number will double.
 &HT;    Open skies are aviation's answer to free markets. The agreements
essentially permit any safety-certified carrier from one signing
country to set schedules and routes to meet market demand in the
other country, without government interference. The United States
has nine such treaties in Latin America, but the largest market
open to unfettered access is Chile, the latest country to sign on.
``Until some more big players sign up, the characteristically
restrictive regulatory environment is still essentially intact,''
says Lee Hibbets, the research director for Air Cargo Management
Group, the U.S. aviation consultants.
 &HT;    The equation makes less sense for many Latin Americans concerned
about the future of the regional aviation industry. While small
markets have opened up to the United States' push for free-market
flying, larger countries with marginally competitive carriers have
bulked at the prospect of U.S. multinational carriers blitzing
their home markets.
 &HT;    Intraregional open skies within Latin America are likely to
become a reality sooner than interregional open skies with the
United States, says Bob Booth, president of Aviation Management
Services. The Andean Pact has had a full open-skies agreement in
place among its members since 1992 that has opened up markets,
particularly on routes between capital cities. The Mercosur bloc
has also finally reached an accord, allowing carriers to provide
international service to cities that are not currently
international destinations. Even with such limitations, that market
alone is expected to generate US$1 billion a year. The first
intra-Mercosur routes have been approved and service should begin
soon.
 &HT;    One significant barrier to U.S. bilateral open-skies agreements
in the region is inadequate safety. Latin American carriers' safety
levels must be endorsed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
before they may serve U.S. airports. Although many countries in the
region are ranked in the top Category I, seven important country
markets-including Colombia and Venezuela-are ranked Category II,
meaning safety is lax.
 &HT;    And eight nations are ranked lowest as Category III, meaning
levels are unacceptable.
 &HT;    Similarly, insufficient airport infrastructure and lax
maintenance practices by many Latin American airlines leave
statute-bound U.S.
 &HT;    officials unable to sign deals. Aging infrastructure and
insufficient technology is a problem common to many regional
airports unable handle the growing volume of commercial traffic.
 &HT;    Latin American aviation executives are lukewarm to the idea of
allowing powerhouse U.S. carriers to romp freely. Many fear that if
they don't team up with a bigger partner, the end may be in sight.
``If we don't get an alliance in our region ... we're going to be
very weak,'' LAN Chile CEO Enrique Cueto said, speaking at a
conference of Latin American aviation CEOs in April. ``In the end,
probably someone will buy us up or we will disappear or we will be
very small companies.'' These fears are driving a growing trend
known as pooling, or code-sharing agreements between airlines
within Latin American trade blocs. Several airlines from the Andean
Pact met earlier this year to discuss pooling arrangements, like
the 1996 TACA alliance formed in Central America. And alliances
between Latin American and other airlines-a trend led by American
Airlines-is growing in importance.
 &HT;    Such alliances will grow faster than open-skies agreements,
given the bureaucracy and built-in resistance to what U.S. carriers
see as the logical and just conclusion of free-market flying. Says
Gus Nordelo, vice president of sales for U.S.-based Challenge Air
Cargo's. ``It's the law of survival. The strong will become
stronger and the weaker will disappear.''

PROPOSALS TO REDEVELOP HISTORIC ISLAND IN N.Y. HARBOR TO BE
UNVEILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Giuliani administration plans to release two
reports next week sketching out redevelopment proposals for
Governors Island, including housing, schools, parks, a new hotel _
and a casino that would provide millions of dollars to finance the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The reports come as civic groups, preservationists, and others
have sharply criticized the city and state for failing to move
quickly to develop the historic island in New York Harbor. They
worry that officials are squandering President Clinton's offer to
give the federally-owned island to New York City, provided the city
and state come up with an acceptable public purpose for the site.
</P>
<P>
   Governors Island, a 172-acre military installation for 300
years, was closed last year and is now virtually a ghost town. Its
last inhabitants, the Coast Guard, left the island in pristine
shape, but preservationists worry that the historic buildings could
quickly slide into decrepitude.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, park and playground proponents hunger for the
island's recreational potential, and New York University and
Columbia are looking at it as a possible home for classrooms and
students.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has suggested several times that casino
gambling could provide a windfall to finance other desirable
development on the island, as well to preserve such historic
treasures as Castle William, one of two forts that long guarded the
harbor. But that plan has run into criticism from preservationists
and some politicians, who have argued that a casino is an
inappropriate use for the site and politically unrealistic as well.
</P>
<P>
   The reports by independent consultants that the city will
release next week will outline the economic pluses and minuses of
various developments, as well as suggest changes to the buildings
needed to achieve them, Deputy Mayor Randy Levine said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The state, which has not taken a position on the island, said it
would follow the city's lead. ``We're looking forward to seeing
what they come up with,'' said Michael McKeon, press secretary to
Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the island's fate remains in limbo, the National
Trust for Historic Preservation plans to include the site in its
new list of the nation's 11 most endangered historic places,
officials of the organization said. The designation, to be
announced on Monday, will group Governors Island with such
imperiled treasures as a Civil War battlefield in Virginia and an
Art Deco hotel in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Moe, the trust's president, said he was worried that the
empty buildings could deteriorate quickly. ``Governors Island could
be on a slippery slope to serious deterioration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moe urged the governor and the mayor to appoint a commission to
quickly come up with alternatives, before the opportunity to
preserve the island is lost. Levine said the reports would answer
this request.
</P>
<P>
   The trust president compared Governors Island with the south
side of Ellis Island, which, unlike the north side, has not been
restored. Last year, the trust put Ellis Island on its list of most
endangered places, an action it believes helped secure a $6 million
Congressional appropriation to stabilize the buildings on the south
side.
</P>
<P>
   If New York does not take over the island by 2002, federal law
requires that it be auctioned for a price Congress has estimated at
$500 million. As part of the process of marketing the island,
hearings on a draft environmental impact statement will be held
June 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   Financing is critical to any redevelopment plan. The Urban Land
Institute, a Washington organization of real estate professionals,
issued a report last year saying any development on Governors
Island would probably need an initial infusion of capital to
jump-start it. Giuliani has several times suggested that casino
development may be a way to get this investment.
</P>
<P>
   But that idea worries many of the groups most interested in the
island's development. ``We can't find anyone who thinks a casino
will work here,'' said Brendan Sexton, president of the Municipal
Art Society. He worries that a bridge from Brooklyn to the island
might be necessary to transport the crowds needed to support a
large casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly want public access, but you don't want thousands
and thousands of people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of civic groups plan to present a plan in September
for a number of uses. Members cite political difficulties with
gambling. Marcia Reiss, policy director for the Parks Council,
pointed out that gambling would have to pass the Legislature twice
and a statewide referendum once. ``I don't see it passing in New
York,'' she said.

EDITORIAL: INTEL INSIDE . . . TARGET RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, June 13:
</P>
<P>
   With its antitrust lawsuit against Intel, the maker of chips for
nearly all personal computers, the Clinton administration took
another step this week to enforce old rules in a new arena.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Justice Department's suit against Microsoft last month,
the Federal Trade Commission's action challenges Intel's conduct as
a monopoly in a fast-changing business.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the government argues correctly that the law
prevents a monopoly from using its dominant position to muscle
competitors, even when competitors are also customers. But whereas
the Microsoft suit could reshape the computing industry, the Intel
suit seeks a modest outcome unlikely to hurt the company or
transform the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC is right to engage, along with the Justice Department,
in protecting competition in computers. But the Intel and Microsoft
cases are different in both scope and significance.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is accused of trying to use its monopoly in the
operating systems for personal computers to capture an even greater
monopoly in the Internet and related technologies, thereby
dominating the future course of the information age. Intel is
accused of withholding technical information on the use of its
chips from three Intel customers. Intel's objective, the FTC says,
was to force these customers to license the patents of their own
new products to Intel on favorable terms.
</P>
<P>
   Since these companies are also rivals in the development of new
chips and other products, the FTC charged that Intel's tactics were
an illegal use of its monopoly power. The suit demands that Intel
cease and desist from discriminating or threatening to discriminate
against ``any similarly situated'' customer.
</P>
<P>
   The atmospherics of the two cases are also different, in ways
that tell much about the nature of competition in the software
business. Intel and the FTC have made a commendable effort to lower
their voices. Intel executives have not followed Bill Gates'
example of vilifying the government for allegedly trying to stifle
innovation. The FTC, for its part, is trying not to be seen as
disabling Intel or sullying its reputation. The commission seems to
realize that, whereas software makers may distrust Microsoft, the
undisputed king of software, no one in the industry wants to see
Intel crippled. After all, Intel's investment of billions each year
in ever faster microprocessors, or chips, makes new generations of
software possible.
</P>
<P>
   Intel does not deny that it did what the FTC charges. Rather it
defends its actions as acceptable and legal in an extremely
competitive environment in which patent suits are endemic and its
own monopoly is actually quite precarious.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the FTC will have a hard time proving that the
company's actions have hurt the consumers who buy computers. They
note, for example, that only one of the three companies cited by
the FTC makes microprocessors that compete with those of Intel.
</P>
<P>
   In pressing its case, the FTC will have to demonstrate with
precision how Intel allegedly tried to undercut competing products
or inventions, and to what degree these actions have hurt
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the constructive atmosphere on both sides, many
people in the business hope that Intel can reach an agreement with
its rivals to refrain from practices that are deemed
anti-competitive. That would be a more welcome development than
having both sides ground down in a protracted court case that could
take years before a final verdict is reached. &QL;

RECRUITING STATION TO GET THAT TIMES SQUARE LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In keeping with the neon-infused rejuvenation of the
area, the famous armed forces recruiting station at the crossroads
of Times Square will be replaced with a flashier recruiting center
just in time for New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The stainless-steel and tinted-glass building has been a fixture
in Times Square since 1950, signing up more recruits than any other
booth in the country _ and serving as a target of protests against
the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   The $600,000 project is being financed by the Army Corps of
Engineers, which says it is wants a building that will fit in with
the dizzying blur of neon signs, billboards, theme restaurants and
electronic ticker tapes that Times Square has become.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the new recruiting booth, first reported Friday in The
Daily News, call for glass walls that night and day will sparkle
red, white and blue in the shape of the American flag, and for a
curtain of nine video monitors showing the military at work.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new building, on the traffic island at 43rd Street
between Broadway and Seventh Avenue, will be smaller than the
existing booth, the four recruiters from the Army, Navy, Air Force
and Marines are promised more room because of a more efficient
design. And it will also have one amenity absent for the last 48
years: a restroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll have a a modern look in keeping with all the changes in
Times Square,'' said Staff Sgt. Alberto Crespo, the Marine
recruiter on duty at the station Friday. ``But it will still
resemble a recruiting station.''
</P>
<P>
   Crespo works at one of four desks in the dark, cramped box,
which replaced what the Corps says was a ``cottage-style building''
put up in 1946. He said the center, despite its small size and
unfashionable look, outperformed every other recruiting operation,
sending about 200 men and women to the armed forces every year.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, the recruiting station has been at the center of
two debates that have nothing to do with war. City Councilman
Thomas K. Duane has suggested that the military, which pays the
city no rent for use of the traffic island, be evicted from the
spot. He argued that the armed forces' ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy requiring soldiers to remain silent about their
homosexuality violated city human rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Times Square Business Improvement District
said the station should be moved because it no longer fit in with
its glitzy neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But those efforts to push out the station set off an outpouring
of support for it, and prompted the Army Corps of Engineers to
speed up renovation plans.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Cassell, an architect at the Architecture Research
Office in Manhattan who designed the new station, said he tried to
create an icon that would be ``as strong as the memory of the
existing booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Shugert, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, said
the Corps was soliciting contractors. Demolition and construction
should begin in August, he said, with the new station opening in
time for a ribbon-cutting ceremony on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Handy, the director of the Mayor's Office of Veterans
Affairs, who supported keeping the recruiting station in Times
Square, said of the renovation plans: ``The military has to keep up
with modern times. It's appropriate that it be remodeled and moved
into the 21st century.'' &QL;

 Por CHARLES W. THURSTON 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NUEVA YORK _ Ser el pez grande en la pecera pequena tiene sus
ventajas. Esa ha sido hasta ahora la experiencia de las aerolineas
de EU que abren rutas en los recien desregulados cielos de America
Latina.
 &HT;    En Centroamerica, la primera region en aceptar la politica de
`cielos abiertos' _ que permite a las aerolineas fijar las
frecuencias de viajes y la capacidad de los aviones en las rutas
internacionales _ las aerolineas estadounidenses American,
Continental y United han comenzado a poblar las nubes
latinoamericanas. Ademas, Delta se expande en Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala y Panama.
 &HT;    Leo Mullin, presidente ejecutivo de Delta, ejemplifica la logica
imperante entre los ejecutivos del sector en EU: ``Los pasajeros
que viajan por razones de negocios o placer ... no aceptan barreras
artificiales. Esta presion insostenible ... por acceso y
facilidades ... a precios competitivos, alentara a las naciones a
buscar tratados liberalizados de trafico aereo,'' dijo.
 &HT;    Pero la retorica de los cielos abiertos es una realidad a medias
en momentos que el trafico aereo regional toma altura. Unos 26
millones de pasajeros viajaron entre EU y America Latina en 1990;
para el 2001, segun la firma de asesoria estadounidense Aviation
Management Services, la cifra aumentara al doble.
 &HT;    La politica de cielos abiertos es la respuesta del sector de la
aviacion civil al libre mercado. Los acuerdos permiten que
cualquier aerolinea con un certificado de seguridad de cualquiera
de los paises signatarios pueda fijar rutas y vuelos para
satisfacer la demanda en el otro pais, sin interferencia de los
gobiernos. EU tiene nueve acuerdos de este tipo con paises
latinoamericanos, pero el mayor mercado de acceso abierto es Chile,
el que mas recientemente se incorporo al acuerdo. ``Hasta que otros
jugadores importantesentren al terreno, el ambiente regulatorio
caracteristicamente restrictivo se mantendra en esencia intacto,''
afirma Lee Hibbets, director de investigaciones de Air Cargo
Management Group, firma asesora de EU. Aunque muchos mercados
pequenos se han abierto, los paises mas grandes, con aerolineas
marginalmente competitivas, se han resistido a la perspectiva de
una invasion de aerolineas estadounidenses. La politica
intrarregional de cielos abiertos en America Latina probablemente
se haga realidad antes que entre Latinoamerica y EU, afirma Bob
Booth, presidente de Aviation Management Services. El Pacto Andino
ya tenia una politica similar entre sus miembros desde 1992. El
Mercosur tambien firmo un acuerdo similar, que permite a las
aerolineas ofrecer vuelos internacionales a ciudades que
actualmente no cuentan con este servicio. Incluso con tales
limitaciones, se espera que este mercado genere US$1.000 millones
al ano. Se espera que las primeras rutas dentro del Mercosur
comiencen a operar pronto. Una barrera importante a los acuerdos
bilaterales de cielos abiertos entre Latinoamerica y EU es el nivel
de seguridad. Las aerolineas latinoamericanas deben estar
certificadas por la Direccion Federal de Aviacion de EU (FAA), y
aunque muchos paises estan calificados, siete mercados importantes
(incluidos Colombia y Venezuela) tienen niveles de seguridad menos
estrictos. Y ocho naciones de la region quedan en la categoria mas
baja, que resulta inaceptable para la FAA.
 &HT;    Ademas, la insuficiente infraestructura de aeropuertos y las
deficientes normas de mantenimiento de muchos aeropuertos
latinoamericanos hacen que EU se vea impedido por ley de firmar
acuerdos de cielos abiertos.
 &HT;    Los ejecutivos de las aerolineas latinoamericanas no estan muy
entusiasmados ante la idea de permitir que los poderosos
transportistas estadounidenses operen libremente en su territorio.
Temen que si no se alian con una aerolinea fuerte su final podria
estar cerca. ``Si no logramos una alianza en nuestra region ...
vamos a ser muy debiles,'' ha expresado Enrique Cueto, presidente
ejecutivo de LAN Chile. ``Al final, probablemente alguna empresa
nos compre, desapareceremos o seremos empresas muy pequenas.''
 &HT;    Esto alienta una tendencia hacia los acuerdos entre las
aerolineas de los grupos comerciales latinoamericanos. Varias
aerolineas del Pacto Andino se reunieron este ano para discutir
acuerdos de este tipo, como la alianza TACA, formada en 1996 en
Centroamerica. Y las alianzas entre las aerolineas latinoamericanas
y de otras regiones, tendencia liderada por American Airlines,
tambien crece en importancia. Tales alianzas creceran mas rapido
que los acuerdos de cielos abiertos, dada la burocracia y la
resistencia a lo que las aerolineas de EU ven como la conclusion
logica al libre mercado. Afirma Gus Nordelo, vicepresidente de
ventas de Challenge Air Cargo, de EU: ``Es la ley de la
supervivencia. El fuerte se fortalecera mas y los debiles
desapareceran.''

 &HT;    NUEVA YORK _ Ser el pez grande en la pecera pequena tiene sus
ventajas. Esa ha sido hasta ahora la experiencia de las aerolineas
de EU que abren rutas en los recien desregulados cielos de America
Latina.
 &HT;    En Centroamerica, la primera region en aceptar la politica de
`cielos abiertos' _ que permite a las aerolineas fijar las
frecuencias de viajes y la capacidad de los aviones en las rutas
internacionales _ las aerolineas estadounidenses American,
Continental y United han comenzado a poblar las nubes
latinoamericanas. Ademas, Delta se expande en Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala y Panama.
 &HT;    Leo Mullin, presidente ejecutivo de Delta, ejemplifica la logica
imperante entre los ejecutivos del sector en EU: ``Los pasajeros
que viajan por razones de negocios o placer ... no aceptan barreras
artificiales. Esta presion insostenible ... por acceso y
facilidades ... a precios competitivos, alentara a las naciones a
buscar tratados liberalizados de trafico aereo,'' dijo.
 &HT;    Pero la retorica de los cielos abiertos es una realidad a medias
en momentos que el trafico aereo regional toma altura. Unos 26
millones de pasajeros viajaron entre EU y America Latina en 1990;
para el 2001, segun la firma de asesoria estadounidense Aviation
Management Services, la cifra aumentara al doble.
 &HT;    La politica de cielos abiertos es la respuesta del sector de la
aviacion civil al libre mercado. Los acuerdos permiten que
cualquier aerolinea con un certificado de seguridad de cualquiera
de los paises signatarios pueda fijar rutas y vuelos para
satisfacer la demanda en el otro pais, sin interferencia de los
gobiernos. EU tiene nueve acuerdos de este tipo con paises
latinoamericanos, pero el mayor mercado de acceso abierto es Chile,
el que mas recientemente se incorporo al acuerdo. ``Hasta que otros
jugadores importantesentren al terreno, el ambiente regulatorio
caracteristicamente restrictivo se mantendra en esencia intacto,''
afirma Lee Hibbets, director de investigaciones de Air Cargo
Management Group, firma asesora de EU. Aunque muchos mercados
pequenos se han abierto, los paises mas grandes, con aerolineas
marginalmente competitivas, se han resistido a la perspectiva de
una invasion de aerolineas estadounidenses. La politica
intrarregional de cielos abiertos en America Latina probablemente
se haga realidad antes que entre Latinoamerica y EU, afirma Bob
Booth, presidente de Aviation Management Services. El Pacto Andino
ya tenia una politica similar entre sus miembros desde 1992. El
Mercosur tambien firmo un acuerdo similar, que permite a las
aerolineas ofrecer vuelos internacionales a ciudades que
actualmente no cuentan con este servicio. Incluso con tales
limitaciones, se espera que este mercado genere US$1.000 millones
al ano. Se espera que las primeras rutas dentro del Mercosur
comiencen a operar pronto. Una barrera importante a los acuerdos
bilaterales de cielos abiertos entre Latinoamerica y EU es el nivel
de seguridad. Las aerolineas latinoamericanas deben estar
certificadas por la Direccion Federal de Aviacion de EU (FAA), y
aunque muchos paises estan calificados, siete mercados importantes
(incluidos Colombia y Venezuela) tienen niveles de seguridad menos
estrictos. Y ocho naciones de la region quedan en la categoria mas
baja, que resulta inaceptable para la FAA.
 &HT;    Ademas, la insuficiente infraestructura de aeropuertos y las
deficientes normas de mantenimiento de muchos aeropuertos
latinoamericanos hacen que EU se vea impedido por ley de firmar
acuerdos de cielos abiertos.
 &HT;    Los ejecutivos de las aerolineas latinoamericanas no estan muy
entusiasmados ante la idea de permitir que los poderosos
transportistas estadounidenses operen libremente en su territorio.
Temen que si no se alian con una aerolinea fuerte su final podria
estar cerca. ``Si no logramos una alianza en nuestra region ...
vamos a ser muy debiles,'' ha expresado Enrique Cueto, presidente
ejecutivo de LAN Chile. ``Al final, probablemente alguna empresa
nos compre, desapareceremos o seremos empresas muy pequenas.''
 &HT;    Esto alienta una tendencia hacia los acuerdos entre las
aerolineas de los grupos comerciales latinoamericanos. Varias
aerolineas del Pacto Andino se reunieron este ano para discutir
acuerdos de este tipo, como la alianza TACA, formada en 1996 en
Centroamerica. Y las alianzas entre las aerolineas latinoamericanas
y de otras regiones, tendencia liderada por American Airlines,
tambien crece en importancia. Tales alianzas creceran mas rapido
que los acuerdos de cielos abiertos, dada la burocracia y la
resistencia a lo que las aerolineas de EU ven como la conclusion
logica al libre mercado. Afirma Gus Nordelo, vicepresidente de
ventas de Challenge Air Cargo, de EU: ``Es la ley de la
supervivencia. El fuerte se fortalecera mas y los debiles
desapareceran.''

STARR INQUIRY FOCUSES ON TALKS WITH POTENTIAL WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prosecutors looking into President Clinton's
relationship with a former White House intern are investigating
contacts between one of his senior aides and potential witnesses
shortly after the investigation began, according to lawyers who
have read a sealed legal opinion describing the contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that according to the opinion, Bruce Lindsey,
deputy White House counsel, spoke with the lawyer for a former
chief White House steward, Michael McGrath. One person close to the
investigation by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel,
said Friday night that McGrath's lawyer had approached Lindsey to
discuss the intern matter.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said Lindsey had also contacted a former personal
assistant to the president, Stephen Goodin, and Vernon Jordan, the
Washington lawyer who is a close friend of Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has acknowledged helping Monica Lewinsky, the former
intern, find a job. Starr is investigating whether Clinton had an
affair with Ms. Lewinsky and tried to cover it up. Clinton has
denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's interest in Lindsey's communications with witnesses
underscores the prosecutor's increasingly focus on how the White
House acted after learning that the Lewinsky investigation was
under way. In other words, Starr is investigating whether there was
a cover-up of a possible cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has invoked attorney-client privilege partly to block
questioning of Lindsey about his contacts with potential witnesses.
U.S. Judge Norma Holloway Johnson rejected that assertion of
privilege in an opinion that was released late last month with some
portions withheld.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Los Angeles Times reported that the withheld
portions of the opinion described Lindsey's contacts with potential
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Without addressing the specific facts of the judge's opinion,
the White House on Friday defended any questioning of witnesses,
whether before or after they testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``That practice is universally recognized to be a necessary part
of any lawyer's effective representation of clients and has been
followed by counsel to Republican and Democratic presidents,'' said
Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official said it was important for White
House lawyers to contact potential witnesses or their lawyers to
determine whether prosecutors were seeking to learn about documents
or conversations that might be covered by a form of privilege.
</P>
<P>
   But another ally of the president's said that although Lindsey's
activities might have been legal, they were politically troubling
because they raised suspicions that he was coaching witnesses.
``From a political perception point of view, you might say, `Hey,
Bruce, that's not the smartest thing to do,''' this person said,
but added, ``What are we supposed to do, run around in the dark?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the parts of her opinion that were released in May, Ms.
Johnson made clear that she had no patience for the argument that
Lindsey's conversations with potential witnesses were privileged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the White House interviewed grand jury witnesses in order
to determine how and whether the president or his aides could avoid
compliance with grand jury subpoenas or otherwise obstruct the
investigation, then the witnesses' identities and the substance of
those interviews would shed light on this,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted, ``White House attorneys are paid by U.S.
taxpayers to provide legal advice on official presidential
decisions, not the private decisions of President Clinton, and
certainly not private, potentially criminal conduct.''

SUTHERLAND LEADS AFTER 2ND ROUND IS SHORTENED BY RAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ It was a wet day at the Buick Classic, but an
easy day for Kevin Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   Though he never teed off, Sutherland maintained his 2-stroke
lead Friday when rain halted second-round play shortly past noon.
Only 17 of the 139 players in the field finished the round, and
more than half the field failed to finish even one hole.
Second-round play was scheduled to resume at 8 a.m. Saturday, but
the forecast called for more rain, with a thunderstorm possible.
The outlook for Sunday was cloudy, with a chance of light rain.
</P>
<P>
   Once the second round is completed, tournament officials will
decide on the rest of the schedule. Possible scenarios include
playing 36 holes on Sunday, extending play to Monday, or shortening
the event to 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland remained at the top of the leader board, thanks to
his 7-under-par 64 in Thursday's opening round. Bob Tway, J.P.
Hayes and Steve Lowery were in a three-way tie for second place
after shooting rounds of 66 on Thursday. None of those players teed
off Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Goydos, who also shot a 66 on Thursday, was the only early
contender who lost significant ground Friday, shooting 3 over par
through 15 holes and falling into a 12th-place tie. Goydos was
unfortunate to have a 7:51 a.m. tee time, forcing him to play in
steady rain. The already thick rough at Westchester Country Club
became even more difficult to hit out of Friday morning, and the
course played much longer, with balls stopping more quickly in the
wet grass.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo and Stewart Cink managed to cope with the wet
conditions, both shooting 3 under par through 15 holes and moving
to even par for the tournament. But the players who teed off Friday
morning envied those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unfair, but it's unlucky,'' said Brad Faxon, who
finished 18 holes Friday morning, shooting a 2-under-par 69 to move
to 1 under for the tournament. ``If I had been sitting in the
clubhouse, I'd be pretty happy that I didn't have to play. The
bottom of the bag gets wet, so every time you pull out a club, it's
wet. The towels are wet, the balls are wet, the umbrella gets
heavy, your grips are wet, your hands get wet. There was a huge
difference in how far the ball traveled. It's a bad break.''
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. Open starting Thursday at the Olympic Club in San
Francisco, many players will be eager to leave if the tournament
cannot be completed on Sunday. However, Faxon was not certain
whether some players would opt to withdraw after Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in contention, you won't withdraw,'' he said. ``Most
of us have played Olympic Club, and you're going to get out there
Monday night anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players figured the challenging conditions of Westchester
Country Club would help them prepare for next week. However, when
play resumes, the greens will be much softer, making it easier to
hit approach shots at the pins. Meanwhile, the bad weather cut
short practice time. More than a dozen players were on the putting
green Friday afternoon despite the heavy rain. But the conditions
were not what they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rain doesn't do us any good,'' Faxon said. ``I thought
yesterday afternoon was as close to Open conditions as you could
get. It was tough. ''
</P>
<P>
   But Sutherland was happy to finish the day where he began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who had to play today got the bad end of the draw,''
he said. ``I didn't even get a chance to warm up. But if I have to
play 36 holes Saturday or Sunday, I don't mind.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The world's second-largest economy sank at a stunning
annual rate of 5.3 percent in the first quarter of this year,
according to official figures released Friday that painted an even
bleaker picture than many economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
   While Japan's economy has been troubled for many months, the
latest official numbers confirmed that economic output has declined
for two consecutive quarters _ the definition generally accepted by
economists for a recession. In addition, they showed that for the
first time since the oil shock of 1974, the economy actually
declined for a full year _ falling by 0.7 percent for the fiscal
year ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Such dismal numbers contributed to a further fall in the yen,
sent shock waves throughout Asia and heightened fears that the
economic crisis could spread from Asia to the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials took care to release Friday's news after the
stock market had closed for the day. Earlier, driven largely by the
declining yen, South Korea's stock market fell by 8 percent Friday,
while the Nikkei 225 benchmark index dipped below 15,000 in the
morning, before closing at 15,022.33, up 8.29 points.
</P>
<P>
   The weaker yen makes Japanese products cheaper and more
competitive, further damaging the economies of its East Asian
neighbors, triggering a relentless spiral of currency devaluations,
and destabilizing financial markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the United States thus far has been mixed, with
consumers benefiting from cheaper imports and lower interest rates
made possible, in part, by the slowdown in Asia. But U.S. corporate
profits have declined recently, in part because of the contraction
in Asian markets. There is fear as well that continued financial
decline in Japan and East Asia could trigger a panic that would
spread to the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials again warned Friday that the yen is falling
too far and too fast. It now takes about 144 yen to buy one dollar,
meaning that the yen has fallen 80 percent since its peak in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday in New York it took 144.72 yen to buy a dollar,
meaning the yen has fallen 3.4 percent this week alone. Since its
peak in 1995, the currency has fallen nearly 45 percent against the
dollar.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will cause a minus effect on the Japanese
economy, `` Koji Omi, head of the Economic Planning Agency, said of
the weak yen Friday, according to Kyodo News Service. But it poses
problems, he added, ``for the whole of the world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Mobile, Ala., on Friday, U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin characterized the economic data as ``worse than
expected.'' He reiterated his view that Japan needs to embrace
fundamental reforms of its financial structure and to vigorously
stimulate its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Economies are slumping throughout Asia as well as in Russia and
Eastern Europe, he said, adding that ``the center of the problem is
in Japan, and it's a very serious problem for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Li Zhaoxing, China's ambassador to the United States, called
upon the Group of Seven industrialized nations and Japan to take
action to bolster the yen. `They know their situation, they know
they have means available,'' Li said. ``If there's a will, there's
a way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists believe that Japan's economy may recover in the
short term, in part because of a huge fiscal stimulus package that
will begin to be felt in the next few weeks. But others warn that
Japan is itself teetering on the edge of a much greater tumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things could fall apart very quickly here and Japan could go
like other countries in Asia _ completely fall apart, or it could
linger on,'' said Brian Rose, an economist at LTCB Warburg
Securities Ltd., a joint venture between Long-Term Credit Bank and
SBC Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Rose cautioned that Japan is now in the throes of an
unpredictable transition to more of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Eastern Europe, if you introduce shock therapy and go
from a non-market to a market, the short term disruption is
enormous,'' Rose said. He added, however, that once the transition
is made, Japan could be poised for strong growth again.
</P>
<P>
   Shimpei Nukaya, vice minister of the Economic Planning Agency,
which released the economic numbers, said that the negative impact
on Japan's economy from the Asian economic crisis was bigger than
the government had expected and that the figures ``underline the
gloomy situation of the national's real economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sluggish for several years, Japan's economy fell into a
recessionary spiral on the impetus of a tax increase last year,
imposed at a moment when the economy instead required a stimulus,
in the view of many economists, who believe that no adequate fiscal
stimulus has yet been applied.
</P>
<P>
   Sales are down at many medium-sized businesses, and Mom-and-Pop
shops are particularly feeling the pinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no customers, even at this hour,'' said Yasuhiko Sato,
a 30-year-old vendor selling tuna fish during lunchtime. ``I see
shops closing down in this area. My bonus is very low. It's
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Teikoku Databank, a private credit research agency, said Friday
that the number of corporate failures in May rose 37.5 percent from
a year ago to 1,791. It was the highest total for the month of May
since 1984.

 TOKYO: since 1984.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Hachiro Hattori, a 75-year-old vendor of wrapping materials,
the solution is to put his pension income into his ailing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I can survive if we buy only food,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement offered new data only for the
January-to-March period, but since Japan's fiscal year ends March
30 the new figures meant that over the course of the last fiscal
year the nation's gross domestic product fell 0.7 percent. That was
the first absolute decline in output since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Exports for the first quarter also declined by 3.8 percent, the
first drop in a dozen years, as troubled Asian economies
drastically cut back on their imports from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable figures to assess economic performance
since then but there is scant evidence of improvement. Still, with
Parliamentary elections next month, the government is trying
desperately to cheer people up.
</P>
<P>
   The elections will choose representatives to the parliament's
upper house, which is less important than the lower house. Still
the election is an important gauge of public sentiment, and Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto wants to do well so as to boost his own
standing and his ability to hold on to his office.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Hashimoto won an expected victory when the Lower House
of Parliament rejected a no-confidence motion against his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Officials point out that the government's massive $111 billion
stimulus package seems about to be approved by the Parliament,
clearing the way for a rush of public funds into the economy. The
ruling Liberal Democratic Party is counting heavily on the public
money to pick up growth.
</P>
<P>
   But industrial production was down six percent in April from the
year before, corporate profits have tumbled 25 percent from the
previous year, prices are falling ominously, and some economists
warn that Japan may be sinking into a deflationary spiral.
Economists fear a vicious cycle in which falling prices and profits
would lead to rising unemployment, which would curb consumption and
bring down prices further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a deflation, that's pretty clear.'' said Robert Alan
Feldman, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. But he added
that the stimulus package would stop the spiral, though not
deflation.
</P>
<P>
   Capital spending for the first quarter fell 5.1 percent, the
steepest decline since 1965. The government also released figures
Friday showing that Japanese manufacturers plan to reduce spending
by 4.4 percent on plant and equipment in the current fiscal year,
which began on April 1. The decline was the first one in four
years, according to the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly hard to see a way out at this point,'' said
Peter Morgan, an economist at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. Morgan
said that Japan needs far-reaching restructuring and added, ``We
are talking about a fundamental transformation of the economic
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese government officials have annoyed some analysts by
seeming to downplay the seriousness of the situation. In the past,
they frequently argued that the economy was simply ''stagnant'' or
at a ``standstill,'' refusing to acknowledge that it was actually
contracting. Indeed, many foreign-based economists have contended
that Japan entered a recession many months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Economic Planning Agency here are expected to
meet later this month to formally discuss when the recession began.

SEN. MCCAIN APOLOGIZES TO PRESIDENT CLINTON FOR JOKE ABOUT CHELSEA,
RENO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Sen. John McCain formally apologized to President
Clinton on Friday for a crass joke he made earlier in the week at
the expense of the first lady, Chelsea Clinton and Attorney General
Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels terrible that he said it,'' McCain press aide Nancy
Ives said.
</P>
<P>
   Ives said a letter of apology had been hand-delivered to the
White House, but she declined to provide a copy to ``The Arizona
Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ives also would not repeat the joke that landed McCain in hot
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel comfortable telling you,'' she said. ``He feels
awful, and he regrets that he said it. . . . I just can't repeat
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Political sources told ``The Republic'' the joke went something
like this: Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly? Because
Janet Reno is her father.
</P>
<P>
   News of McCain's offending quip first appeared in the
``Washington'' ``Pos''t's ``Reliable Sources'' political column
Friday. It said McCain ``drew some gasps but more guffaws at a GOP
Senate fund-raiser Tuesday night'' when he launched the ``shocking
barb.'' The newspaper did not report the content of the remark.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Post'' quoted McCain as saying Thursday night: ``Yes, I
made a very unfortunate and insensitive remark. It was the wrong
thing to do, and I have no excuse for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton considered McCain's apology letter to be heartfelt,
White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry told ``The'' ``Republic''
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president certainly understands how you get caught saying
things you ordinarily wouldn't have said,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said Clinton may have even called McCain to assure him
there were no hard feelings. The president was traveling Friday,
and McCurry could not confirm whether the call had been placed.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also would not release McCain's letter of the
apology, saying the matter was private.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Clinton have been working side-by-side lately on a
number of contentious issues, including the tobacco bill and
campaign-finance reform. McCain has also come to Clinton's defense
on some of his nominations and foreign-policy decisions on the
ground that the chief executive's authority must be respected.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's gaffe comes just as he is eyeing a possible White House
bid in 2000, and enjoying a virtual lovefest in the national media.
Even CBS' hard-hitting Mike Wallace fawns over McCain. Wallace was
quoted in the ``Post'' this week as saying he might quit his job to
become McCain's press secretary if McCain gets the GOP presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was not the first time McCain has found himself
apologizing for his razor-edged remarks.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, McCain wrote a letter of apology to House Speaker
Newt Gingrich for comparing the GOP leader's poll numbers to mass
murderer Jeffrey Dahmer's.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, McCain referred to the Arizona Cardinals
as the ``St. Louis Cardinals'' during a speech at a Phoenix
fund-raiser for McCain's re-election campaign. Cardinals owner Bill
Bidwill was among those in attendance at the event.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told ``The Republic'' then that he wouldn't go overboard
in watching his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go through life anymore worrying about people taking
comments of mine out of context,'' he said. ``I also try to use
humor, and several times that's been distorted. It's just something
you've got to live with, and I'm too old to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, McCain even chuckled about his penchant for getting
into trouble with his blunt talk in a profile in ``Esquire''
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, McCain was quoted as saying of his congressional
colleagues, ``The House doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his fellow senators, McCain added: ``Some of these guys,
have they even had lives? What have they done? . . . Aw, jeez, this
is exactly the kind of thing that gets me in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona voters, though, may be more understanding of McCain than
most.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1986 bid to fill the seat vacated by another outspoken
Arizona politician, the late Barry Goldwater, McCain made a joke to
a group of university students in which he referred to Leisure
World as ``Seizure World.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain won anyway. &QL;

   JAPANESE ECONOMY WEAKER THAN BELIEVED, DATA SHOW
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy, the world's second largest, sank at a stunning
annual rate of 5.3 percent in the first quarter of this year, the
government said in an official report that painted an even bleaker
picture than expected and confirmed that the nation is in a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released after Japan's battered stock market had
closed for the day, but the yen kept falling, reaching another
eight-year low against the dollar. Although the benchmark Nikkei
225 index rose 8.29 points, it finished the week with a loss of
301.1 points or nearly 2 percent, and is down 13 percent from its
March 2 high.
</P>
<P>
   KOREAN STOCKS PLUNGE 8.1 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Korean stocks tumbled, returning to the 11-year lows reached
last month. The latest drop comes amid worries about the pace of
economic change and labor unrest. The key market index fell 8.1
percent, to 302.09 _ the lowest since January 1987.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER PRICES ROSE 0.2 PERCENT IN MAY
</P>
<P>
   Prices paid to producers rose rose 0.2 percent in May _ the same
increase as in April _ largely because of a sharp gain in the cost
of prescription drugs. Analysts saw no sign of a pickup in
inflation in the data. Another economic report pointed to a
slowdown. Business inventories of unsold goods rose 0.2 percent in
April _ the slowest gain in three months.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDMAN, SACHS PARTNERS MEET
</P>
<P>
   The 190 partners of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. met to consider a
proposal to turn the firm, Wall Street's last major private
partnership, into a public company. A Goldman spokesman said the
firm would probably announce Sunday whether or not the partners
backed the plan to go public.
</P>
<P>
   SEAGRAM FILES FOR TROPICANA SALE
</P>
<P>
   Seagram expects to raise as much as $3.6 billion when it sells
its Tropicana juice business in an initial public offering, the
company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Seagram disclosed plans for an IPO on May 21, when it
agreed to acquire Polygram, the music giant, for $10.6 billion in
cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   OIL DRILLING MORATORIUM IS EXTENDED
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced a 10-year extension of the
moratorium on oil drilling off virtually all American ocean
coastlines. The moratorium does not affect areas off the Texas and
Louisiana coasts, where extensive drilling has been going on for
years.
</P>
<P>
   BIG STAKE IN BRITISH CABLE UNIT SOLD
</P>
<P>
   BCE, the Canadian telecommunications company, sold its 14.25
percent stake in Cable and Wireless Communications for (British
pounds)975.2 million ($1.59 billion), in a move to exit the British
cable television industry.
</P>
<P>
   VW UNIT TO BUY LAMBORGHINI
</P>
<P>
   A week after Volkswagen won its bid to acquire Rolls-Royce, the
German car maker is adding another storied name to its garage: the
company's Audi unit has agreed to buy Lamborghini SpA, the Italian
sports car maker. Terms were not disclosed, but analysts estimated
Lamborghini's worth at $111 million.
</P>
<P>
   FCC SCALES BACK INTERNET PLAN
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from lawmakers who argued that the program would
increase long-distance telephone rates, the Federal Communications
Commission decided to reduce by more than 40 percent the budget of
a plan to connect schools and libraries to the Internet.
Long-distance carriers are required to provide most of the money
for the program. Under the revised plan, $1.275 billion will be
raised this year, down from an original maximum of $2.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   NEW GLOBAL INITIATIVE ON CHILD LABOR
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is supporting a proposed treaty to
outlaw the most exploitive forms of child labor. The new
International Labor Organization initiative comes 25 years after
the body first tried to curb such abuses. The new convention
focuses on such extreme forms of child labor as working in mines
and prostitution.

IN TARRYTOWN KILLINGS, STARKLY DIVERGENT VIEWS OF A MOTIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TARRYTOWN, N.Y. _ During the four hours that Anthony
Ambrosovich, a retired police officer, held 100 police officers at
bay outside his home here, he tried to make a female officer and
friend understand why he would murder a wife he seemed to dote on
and a daughter he seemed to love.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's gone,'' he said of his 70-year-old wife, Gloria, sobbing
uncontrollably as he spoke on the telephone. ``She's at peace and
she doesn't have to suffer anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Those remarks led Officer Ellen Lewit of the Greenburgh Police
Department, a close friend of the Ambrosoviches since childhood, to
believe that Ambrosovich, 65, shot his wife in something of a mercy
killing, intending to end the relentless pain of the scoliosis that
was progressively arching her back.
</P>
<P>
   But two high-ranking law enforcement officials familiar with
statements Ambrosovich made after his arrest on Thursday night
painted a far more malevolent picture of his motivations. The
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
Ambrosovich hated his wife and his daughter, Melinda Podesta, 40.
They said Ambrosovich, who retired in the mid-1980s from the Town
of Mamaroneck Police Department, was already known as a troubled
man by the Tarrytown Police Department because of the fierce fights
he had with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   What ``hasn't she done to ruin my life?'' the officials said he
told them on Thursday night while he admitted that he killed the
two women.
</P>
<P>
   His statement also suggested that he was pleased as well by the
death of his daughter, the mother of three of his six
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shot my daughter in the neck so she'd bleed more,'' police
officials said he told them.
</P>
<P>
   That was the baffling picture that emerged Friday as Ambrosovich
was arraigned in Tarrytown Village Court on two counts of
second-degree murder. Prosecutors said they were considering
upgrading the charges to first-degree murder, which would make
Ambrosovich eligible for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff in a quiet working-class neighborhood near the
Tappan Zee Bridge started shortly after noon on Thursday when Kevin
Kowalski, the boyfriend of Melinda Podesta, waved down a car and
told the driver he had been shot in the Ambrosovich house on
Sheldon Avenue. County and municipal police officers, two
helicopters and an armored personnel carrier converged on the
street, and police negotiators succeeded in talking Ambrosovich
into coming out of his clapboard house.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief negotiators was an ordinary patrol officer,
Ellen Lewit. Ambrosovich, who was known in his neighborhood as Tony
Ambrose, asked the negotiators if she could be brought to the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Lewit, 36, said that from everything she knew,
Ambrosovich was a caring husband. Although he himself was ailing
from emphysema, he was particularly attentive, she said, during the
last few years as Gloria Ambrosovich's lifelong scoliosis worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a chair, Lewit demonstrated how Mrs. Ambrosovich's
scoliosis brought her face to within a few inches of her knees
whenever she sat in a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Lewit said she and her mother had last spoken to Mrs.
Ambrosovich on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much longer I can take it,'' she said Mrs.
Ambrosovich told them. ``I'm in agony. The doctors can't do
anything for me.''
</P>
<P>
   For three hours during the siege, Lewit spoke to Ambrosovich by
telephone and urged him to put down his guns and come out. During
their conversations, she recalled, he repeated his feelings of both
sorrow and relief over what had happened to his wife. Then,
finally, he threw his guns out the door and came outside, dressed
in green bermuda shorts and a striped polo shirt.
</P>
<P>
   When the bodies were found inside the house, Lewit said, she had
to confront the essential mystery in a man she had known
practically all her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the man I know,'' she said. ``Tony is a loving,
hug-you-to-pieces kind of guy. This is tough.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   What's in a name? Increasingly for makers of generic drugs,
everything _ a seemingly odd state of affairs for an industry whose
stock in trade is cheap no-name knockoffs of brands that have lost
their patents.
</P>
<P>
   With too many players in too many parts of the business,
companies that primarily sell generics often find themselves lost
in the crowd, able to stand out on pharmacy shelves only by cutting
prices. More and more, though, they are replacing the identically
drab scientific labels on their products with brand names of their
own, raising prices in step with a higher profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tries to undercut each other on price _ it all
becomes a highwire act,'' said Allen Chao, the chief executive of
Watson Pharmaceuticals, a generic drug maker based in Corona,
Calif., adding, ``We decided the only way to deliver consistent
earnings, quarter after quarter, was to go into the branded drug
business.''
</P>
<P>
   There have always been some brand names in the generic drug
cabinet. When a drug loses its patent protection, one company gets
the right to sell a generic version for about six months, after
which others are allowed in. Some companies immediately put a brand
name on that first version and back it with marketing to doctors
and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is only lately that generics makers have begun to
scramble for new ways to add names to their products. In some
cases, analysts say, they have even tried to come in through the
back door by giving an existing generic drug the kind of hold on a
market that only a name brand would have.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of waiting around for drugs to come off patent, Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA, one of the nation's largest generics makers,
has begun to develop its own patented brands. Two years ago, the
company rolled out Copaxone for multiple sclerosis and it now has
10 other products in the pipeline. Mylan Laboratories, another big
generics maker, has six new drugs in development, including
Sulfamylon, a burn medication.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are buying up branded generics that others have
developed. Watson paid $290 million last year to acquire two lines
of such drugs, including the oral contraceptive Trivora and Dilacor
XR for hypertension. With the purchase, branded drugs are expected
to contribute a little more than half of Watson's estimated $550
million in sales this year, analysts say, up from nothing just
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And a few companies, like Mylan, have entered into exclusive
agreements with the suppliers of chemicals and other raw materials
for their drugs, arrangements that can have the effect of reducing
the number of generics competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of lorazepam, an anti-anxiety drug, Mylan was able
to reduce its top competitors largely to just Ativan, the original
patented version by American Home Products. In February, after it
had the field more to itself, Mylan raised the wholesale price of
its version of lorazepam by 343 percent, to $796.67 for 1,000
pills, from $179.95. The company attributed the jump to regulatory
delays and legal fees from patent disputes, not to its arrangement
with a supplier. A spokeswoman added that Mylan's competitors could
have gone to other suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, money is at the heart of the generic makers'
strategic shift. Branded drugs _ whether patented original formulas
or generics with names _ boast profit margins of up to 70 percent
or more, twice that of regular generics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to have branded drugs in order to have
sustainable margins,'' said Thomas Anderson, president of the U.S.
pharmaceutical division of Alpharma Inc., the nation's leading
maker of generic liquid drugs. Alpharma started marketing its first
branded generic in March.
</P>
<P>
   The shift has largely escaped the notice of consumers, at least
those who have insurance for prescription drugs or still have the
option to use cheaper unbranded generics. But the sudden price
increase of lorazepam and some other generics has upset
pharmacists, who are unable to pass along the increases as quickly
as they would like. It has also riled some members of Congress, who
have called for investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest impact has been felt by other companies in the
generics industry and by investors, with the stock price of both
Watson and Mylan, for example, climbing more than 90 percent in the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The generics companies that have changed at least some of their
stripes say they had no choice. While most executives readily admit
that the generics industry can be enormously profitable, they also
say that only a few companies ever share in the bounty. There are
simply too many players in some categories, and landing the rights
to be the first to make a generic version of a popular drug can
often be troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   Drug patents now last for 20 years. Yet by the time a company
actually gets a drug to market, its patent has already largely
expired, leaving it just eight years on average to be the lone
seller. At the end of the patent period, companies often sue to
protect their exclusivity by raising questions about the ability of
generics makers to produce a safe substitute. Such a challenge can
cost a generics maker millions of dollars in legal fees and lost
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big pharmaceutical companies have the power and staff to
fight a legal battle,'' said Chao of Watson. ``It's been this way
in the generics business for the past 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Other market factors have lately made matters worse. The
nation's drug wholesalers have long complained that the generics
industry _ valued at $7.9 billion in the United States last year,
or 8.4 percent of total drug sales _ has too many players, creating
inefficiencies and extra costs. In 1996, several of the wholesalers
_ including industry leaders Cardinal Health Inc. of Dublin, Ohio,
and McKesson Corp. of San Francisco _ reduced the number of their
so-called preferred suppliers, forcing many of the small
manufacturers out of business. The carnage prompted many chief
executives to quickly add some ballast to their bottom lines.

   The alternative was to be caught in punishing price wars. Last
year, for example, several of Teva's rivals brought out their
versions of clonazepam, an anti-convulsant generic that Teva had
been the first to market. To remain competitive, Teva, based in
Sellersville, Pa., dropped the price by 50 percent. When Teva's
parent, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries of Israel, announced a 20
percent decline in first-quarter earnings in May, company
executives cited clonazepam as a prime cause.
</P>
<P>
   Yet laying claim to a branded drug is neither easy nor
inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   To roll out a new patented formula can cost $450 million to $600
million in research and development. (Teva is spending less because
of a research-sharing arrangement with some Israeli universities
and hospitals.)
</P>
<P>
   To develop a branded generic, a company has to choose a drug
that is technically difficult to reproduce, which will tend to
narrow the number of possible competitors.
</P>
<P>
   It also has to be prepared to back its new named version with a
marketing campaign directed at doctors, who can specify a branded
generic when writing a prescription. Anything with a name _ which
brings with it the implication of higher quality than something
without one _ can command a higher price.
</P>
<P>
   Enough money is at stake to spark a controversy, as it has over
Mylan's exclusive arrangement with one supplier. Pittsburgh-based
Mylan struck that deal shortly after the final quarter of 1997,
when 41 of its 97 generic drugs lost money.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the supplier, which involved raw materials
for several other generics besides lorazepam, gave Mylan ``the
majority of the market until competitors could catch up,'' said Ian
Sanderson of Cowen &AMP; Co. ``The company can triple sales from that
drug,'' he added, referring to lorazepam.
</P>
<P>
   But the price increase _ as well as similar increases by other
generics makers, including Geneva Pharmaceuticals USA, a division
of Novartis _ was greeted by a nationwide chorus of criticism from
independent pharmacists. It takes several weeks for insurers to
alter their reimbursement schedules following price increases, the
pharmacists complained, forcing them to absorb the difference in
some cases.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Friday that the enormous price increase in
lorazepam was largely responsible for the record 10.7 percent rise
in the price of prescription drugs in May from a month earlier.
Experts noted the producer price index does not track a large
universe of drugs, which makes it susceptible to sudden increases
of a few products.
</P>
<P>
   The flap also raised the ire of Reps. Pete Stark, D-Calif., and
Marion Berry, D-Ark. Stark recently asked Attorney General Janet
Reno and Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert Pitofsky to
review the price increases. So far, neither has responded. Berry, a
former pharmacist, introduced a bill in May to create a commission
to look into pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been all kinds of allegations that some of the
generic makers have cornered the market on raw materials,'' Berry
said. ``Well, we don't know if that's true or not. But it's
something that we need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, Berry's commission will stumble on one prime fact:
At least some generics makers are not hurting for money. Thanks in
part to their moves into name brands, earnings at Mylan increased
59.7 percent for the year ended in March, to $100.8 million, while
profits at Watson jumped 31 percent, to $103.1 million, excluding
special acquisition costs. The performance of their stocks was even
better.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, the kingpin stock among the big drug
companies has been Pfizer's. Propelled by Viagra, its now
ubiquitous impotency treatment, Pfizer's shares have risen 112
percent since May 1997. But over the same period, Watson's stock
has increased 135 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smaller companies can sometimes reward investors better than
large firms because they start from a smaller base,'' said David
Saks, a managing director at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``Most of the generic
stocks have done great. A good small new branded generic drug can
be just as important to Watson as Viagra was to Pfizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Teva Pharmaceutical Industries seems to be in line for such a
boost because of its recent agreement with Biovail Corp.
International of Toronto to market several of its
controlled-release drugs, including Procardia XL, a hypertension
drug. Saks estimated the deal could add $1 annually to Teva's
earnings per share. The company earned $1.95 a share last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with all these gains, none of the major generics makers
are ready to abandon the product that made their name in the first
place: cheap off-patent drugs.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, knockoffs are becoming more popular. Generic
drugs now account for 42.1 percent of all dispensed prescriptions,
up from 32.4 percent six years ago, according to IMS Health, an
industry consultant. For another, their ranks are going to swell in
the next decade as branded drugs that now generate some $41 billion
a year in revenues come off patent. These drugs include such
superstars as Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.'s Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with all the legal problems, there is still a lot of
money to be made with generic drugs,'' said William Fletcher, chief
executive of Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, referring to the chance to
be the first generic maker of an off-patent drug. ``If it takes us
six months or three years to get the rights to the generic, we want
to be there.''

A WELL-RESTED DE LA HOYA SWAGGERS INTO THE SUN BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ They have rushed his limousine hard enough to
crack a windshield and followed his entourage across town to
transform what was supposed to be a secret workout into a runway
show for 1,000 shrieking fans. Now, Oscar De La Hoya really goes
big.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 52,000 people are expected at the Sun Bowl on Saturday
night to witness De La Hoya make his first World Boxing Council
welterweight title defense of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That his opponent, a Frenchman named Patrick Charpentier, is the
No. 1 contender, is something rarely mentioned by De La Hoya or the
fans who have pursued the heartthrob across this border town with
the ardor usually witnessed on the mall tours of the teen-age
musical group Hanson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen much of him,'' De La Hoya said. ``For somebody
to beat me up in that ring is going to be tough. It's going to be
impossible, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, a four-time champion with a 27-0 record, credits a
six-month layoff, as well as El Paso's rock star reception, for his
new air of invincibility. The fight with the lightly regarded
Charpentier (27-4-1, 23 knockouts) was postponed two times while De
La Hoya recovered from ligament damage in his left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   But De La Hoya said the rest was badly needed after he moved up
to the 147-pound division to defeat David Kamau, Hector Camacho and
Wilfred Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   ``The layoff did some good,'' said De La Hoya, who will earn $4
million for the mandatory title defense. ``I fought five times in
1997. Going into the 147-pound division, I really felt a change in
my body strength and my speed. I feel like a new fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   He indeed looked muscular at Friday's weigh in, tipping the
scales at 147 pounds. But more important is the fighter's newfound
swagger, which he said was the result of finally deciding that he
wanted to stay in the boxing game. While keeping a grueling 1997
boxing schedule, De La Hoya, 25, often spoke about retiring to
pursue modeling or an acting career, or some other business
venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the time off, I asked myself, `Do I really want to fight,
or do I want to do something else?''' he said. ``This is what I
chose. I'm the champ.''
</P>
<P>
   Every one of his appearances here has brought police barricades
and a crush of mostly female fans. Reasonably priced tickets _ from
$35 to $300 _ have insured that the 60,000-seat Sun Bowl will be
crowded. Promoters are expecting the second largest outdoor crowd
for a fight in the United States, behind the 61,000 at Yankee
Stadium in September 1955 for the Rocky Marciano-Archie Moore bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-five percent of our seats were less than $65, and 80
percent of our tickets have been sold to women,'' said the local
promoter, Nick Huzella. ``This is the biggest event this town has
ever held.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Charpentier has been a good sport about the
wild scenes that have graced his and De La Hoya's joint
appearances. He weighed in at 146 pounds and will collect $600,000
to play the Golden Boy's supporting actor. But Charpentier conceded
he was irked at being ignored. ``I'm no joke,'' he said through an
interpreter at a news conference. ``He's in for a tough fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, no one really heard him. His defiant words were
drowned out by a blizzard of high-pitched requests for De La Hoya's
hand in marriage _ or other less formal arrangements. &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE CITY THAT ALWAYS SLEEPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in editorial for Saturday, June 13:
</P>
<P>
   When a mature horse lies down in a pasture to sleep, you know
that it is comfortable in its surroundings. The same is true when a
New Yorker dozes in public _ on one of the green chairs in Bryant
Park, on the steps of the Met, on a hillock in Central Park, or
anywhere else, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Some New Yorkers manage to nod off discreetly, almost warily, at
lunchtime in the open air, as though they had just tipped their
heads back to get some sun on the wattles. Others sleep with
rhetorical abandon _ with a budget of gurgles and starts and
impromptu ratchetings from the throat. But discreet and indiscreet
alike have managed to let down their guard, to rely, something like
a horse, on the attention of the herd that surrounds them.
</P>
<P>
   In this city each of us perpetually renegotiates the boundary
between private and public space as we move about. In some places
we can accept close confinement _ an elevator or subway car, for
instance _ and in some we can't.
</P>
<P>
   To fall asleep in public, even for a minute or two, raises an
interesting question. Does all the world suddenly become public
space, the conscious ``I'' having dissolved in slumber? Or does all
the world suddenly become private space, folded within the napper's
darkness? Or does the notion of space itself simply vanish, since
those of us who are not sleeping suddenly become as imperceptible
to a sleeper as we sometimes feel to ourselves?
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who has felt the warm June sun reasoning him into a
short nap knows that the city's noise doesn't prevent sleep; it is
what makes it possible. Street noise is simply the sound of
people's preoccupation, their distraction. It is the sound of
normalcy, making it safe to doze off.
</P>
<P>
   To fall asleep in public is to borrow from the common alertness,
a loan you repay when something _ who knows what? _ tears the
fabric of sleep, and you wake to a city that seems to have been
washed in a cool afternoon rain, and you stand up and go about your
business with a clear head, even as others begin to nod off in the
sunshine around you. &QL;

INDIAN LEADERS TALK CONGRESS ABOUT NEW POWER TO SHAPE OWN WELFARE
REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Victoria Molina wants strangers to stop complaining
about her having babies on taxpayer's money and government workers
to stop asking how she spends that money.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, she wants her children to stop complaining because
there's only enough money for one meal a day.
</P>
<P>
   Now the welfare mother knows how to make it all stop.
</P>
<P>
   And it's going to start with a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   Molina, along with seven other welfare mothers from the Pascua
Yaqui Tribe in Tucson, have learned to use that screwdriver to tear
apart a computer and put it back together.
</P>
<P>
   It's the mothers' first and frightening step in learning to
compete for wealth in a system that often treats them with insult
and indifference.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the first step in a welfare reform program designed by
the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, the first of Arizona's 21 Native American
communities to take charge of its own program to get parents from
welfare to work. White Mountain Apache community's welfare program
started in April.
</P>
<P>
   Tribes throughout the state and country are just beginning to
take advantage of the power and money granted them by the 1996
federal welfare law to customize their own reform programs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 16 Indian-run programs across the nation are
designed to emphasize education and soften the punitive nature of
many state programs. And most are in need of more money.
</P>
<P>
   The Pascua Yaqui Tribe needs computer technicians, so they're
training their own.
</P>
<P>
   By October, some welfare parents in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa
community will be attending desk top publishing or nursing courses.
</P>
<P>
   On the remote Navajo Nation, where jobs and training are scarce,
welfare parents could soon be asked to tend sheep or chop wood for
their elders in exchange for their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation, philosophically, certainly supports the ideals of
personal responsibility and self sufficiency,'' said Virgil Pablo,
a director with the Navajo Nation's Social Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the remoteness on the reservation and limited access to
development in remote and isolated areas, we're in the best
position to say what is appropriate for us,'' Pablo said.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Garcia, who designed the Yaqui program, calls the emphasis
on education the basic philosophical difference between the Yaquis'
program and the state-run program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to prepare parents to be a successful provider, not
someone who lives on the fringes,'' said Garcia, who knows Molina
and many of the mothers in her computer class know how to get a job
and have supplemented their welfare income waitressing and filing.
``These people have always been on the fringes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Garcia said, they want a career.
</P>
<P>
   But if they are to succeed, Arizona Indian leaders told a U.S.
Congressional hearing Friday that Native American governments need
more flexibility, more independence and money, and a sincere effort
by counties and the state to create jobs in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Indian leaders were invited to report their welfare reform
progress and problems to Arizona's Congressman J.D. Hayworth and
Rep. Clay Shaw of Florida, chairman of the U.S. House Ways and
Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, at a hearing in the state
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arizona tribes are grappling with the opportunity to
cushion their members from the harsher blows of the state's welfare
reform and to refocus their own bureaucracies to aid their neediest
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique opportunity the state can't begin to do because
they have thousands of people,'' said Lillia Castaneda, who is in
charge of putting the Salt River community's 250 to 400 adults now
receiving benefits to work. ``They're not numbers to us, they're
people. They're families.''
</P>
<P>
   But it won't work unless scattered tribal bureaucracies learn to
work with each other and with numerous state and federal agencies
distributing bits and pieces of welfare funds, said Eddie Brown,
Associate Dean at the Center for American Indian Studies at
Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   He also isn't sure that the federal government is ready to pay
the price of putting people to work on the nation's poorest
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Native Americans living on reservations that maintain 50 percent
or more unemployment are exempt from the national five-year family
limit on welfare benefits. That limit is pressuring states to move
quickly with reform. Nine Arizona tribes are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   That exemption is a blessing and a curse, said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blessing because it understands that living on a
reservation is not a normal situation,'' said Brown. Expensive
problems that keep people out of work, such as drug and alcohol
addiction, domestic violence, poor education and teen births, and
lack of jobs, are more prevelent in Indian communities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   It's a curse, he contends, because by dropping the five-year
limit, the federal government all but admitted it doesn't want to
pay for solving those complicated problems.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers in the Pascua Yaqui computer class, among 50 parents
who are in jobs or training through the tribe's welfare program,
are the cream of the welfare population, young, smart, articulate
and easily motivated, said Garcia, Social Service director.
</P>
<P>
   He knows many parents will need more time and cost more money to
prepare for work, some are older with more children and less
education and more behavioral health and medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Garcia said, the community has services to help these
families, but some programs, such as childcare, already have
waiting lists. There is little money and staff to help find
families who simply drop off of the welfare roles, perhaps because
of drug, alcohol or domestic abuse problems _ families Garcia is
unwilling to let go.
</P>
<P>
   As Indian communities across the nation struggle with short
funds and a long list of problems, they are watching the Navajo
Nation's legal battle with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the power and money granted to tribes, they still remain
dependent on state-run offices to determine eligibility and
distribute cash benefits for their members.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo Nation wants a block grant that will give it
state-like authority and funding to take over and streamline the
entire welfare program, including eligibility and distribution of
cash benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It wants to avoid entering into agreements with the three
different states its sprawling reservation covers and avoid working
with three different federal regional offices.
</P>
<P>
   While the Navajos continue their legal struggle, the Yaqui Tribe
is implementing a gentler program than the massive one run by the
state, where welfare roles have been slashed nearly in half in a
little more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Yaqui communities, where unemployment is 30 percent, are
still bound by the five-year welfare limit, but they have
eliminated the state-imposed 2-year welfare limit for adults and
will still provide benefits to children born while parents are on
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   While the state program emphasizes quick job placement, the
Yaquis are spending more time and money on education.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe has 350 welfare families, or about 10 percent of its
membership, some of whom live in in Scottsdale and Guadalupe. This
tiny, small-town program can provide face to face encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Molina and her other classmates only agreed to commit to the
two-year computer course after people they knew knocked on their
doors, tapped them on the shoulder, gave them a little push and
took them by the hand to prove to them they could compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jorge (Garcia) came to my house,'' said Molina. ``I was
cleaning. I told him, `I'm not even dressed.' He said, `Just go
like you are.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia drove the nervous Molina to the tribal offices to
interview for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' Molina said. ``I've just been having kids and
staying home and didn't feel I had the knowledge to learn
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina's classmates and teacher said she's now the first to
volunteer to wrestle the insides of a computer she was once afraid
to touch.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Molina's children who keep her coming every day. She
renewed her friendship with her distant 13-year-old daughter with
conversations about computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling everybody `My mom's in computer class. My
mom's building computers.' '' &QL;

LENGTHENING AND UNWINDING THE ROAD TO NOVEMBER 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYERS Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The primary and caucus season for the presidential election of
2000 is still the better part of 20 months away. But the gathering
of a dozen Republican wannabes in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, this weekend
for one of those hey-look-me-over affairs _ no straw poll, just
speaking and schmoozing _ is proof positive that the race is well
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there was any doubt. The political pros in Iowa who
track such things say that because no incumbent will be running,
White House wannabes have been flocking to the state at a record
rate for months, at least five times the 1996 rate.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's gathering, sponsored by the state's Republican
Party, is being advertised as the ``First-in-the-Nation Gala'' _ a
pointed reminder that Iowa traditionally holds the first caucus,
not the first dog-and-pony gala (of which there have been others,
in other states).
</P>
<P>
   But will Iowa hold the first-in-the-nation caucus in 2000? And
will New Hampshire hold the first primary?
</P>
<P>
   For the past several weeks, secretaries of state from New
England, the West Coast and the Rocky Mountain states have been
conferring about how to adjust the primary and caucus season so
that it will not be as ``front-loaded'' in 2000 as it has been in
recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduling of the 1996 primaries and caucuses particularly
concerned election officials because so many states held their
contests early _ some seeking prestige, others seeking a bigger
nominating role _ that the process was over almost before it began.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing will be decided until all state secretaries have had
their say during our annual meeting in Salt Lake in July,'' William
Galvin, secretary of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, reported
after a Wednesday conference with New England and California
election officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one idea that's got a lot of interest and might appeal to
state parties and legislatures is a carefully spread-out series of
regional primaries and caucuses, with the region that goes first in
one election going last four years later, and so forth. Iowa, like
New Hampshire, probably would be left alone, to go first as
always.''
</P>
<P>
   Lure of Bright Lights And Big, Barry-less City
</P>
<P>
   The nation's capital is filled with former legislators who never
went back home after retiring or being turned out of office.
Seduced by the city's power, majesty and easy money in law and
lobbying, many find it hard to return to the place they once
represented.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Pressler, a Republican, spent 22 years on Capitol Hill
representing South Dakota, initially in the House, later in the
Senate. In 1996, he failed to win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   He did not head for home. Rather, he took up the practice of law
in Washington. Now he is thinking about getting back into politics
_ in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, he says, he will decide whether to run
for mayor, entering a race blown wide open when Marion Barry, a
Democrat, announced he would not seek re-election after five terms.
</P>
<P>
   Pressler would be a long shot, at best. A very long shot: a
white conservative Republican from one of the most rural states
running in a jurisdiction that is totally urban, overwhelmingly
Democratic and 90 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the daunting challenge he would face in winning even
Republican support for a run, since the leading Republican
candidate, Councilwoman Carol Schwartz, made the best showing ever
by a Republican against Barry when she captured more than 40
percent of the vote in the last election.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pressler predicted that should he run, his support for
school vouchers and tax breaks for residents and businesses could
be his ticket to victory in a city that has lost many families and
businesses in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Again, New Hampshire Daunts the Democrats
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire can be a tough place for Democrats, given that
they have long been outnumbered there by Republicans. Yet back in
1996, by aggressively raising money and recruiting strong
candidates, the party had an unusually good run, helping President
Clinton to a solid victory, electing Jeanne Shaheen as governor and
giving a scare to the Republican incumbents in all three
congressional contests.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic hopes of capitalizing on that success in 1998 are
waning fast.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gov. Shaheen is favored to win re-election, Democrats
stand no reasonable chance of gaining control of the state
Legislature, and the party's Congressional candidates have almost
no prospects for victory. The nagging old Democratic problems of
raising money and finding good contenders are back, and with them
the old, debilitating minority-party mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican incumbents, Sen. Judd Gregg and Representative
Charles Bass, are heavy favorites for re-election because the
Democrats recruited to challenge them are underfinanced political
unknowns. And in the third contest, the Republican incumbent, Rep.
John Sununu, son of the former Gov. John H. Sununu, has no
Democratic opponent at all.
</P>
<P>
   He had one briefly, last week. But five days of uphill
campaigning convinced the challenger, Wayne Burton, an educator,
that 1998 was not going to be much of a Democratic year in New
Hampshire. He withdrew Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Burton had entered the race proclaiming he would show that a
``working professional'' and political neophyte could successfully
run for office and still hold down a full-time job. He pulled out
lamenting that he had ``proved just the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Initial elation turned into dread when the enormity of the
commitment became clear,'' he said. ``The system is not
particularly accessible to people with good ideas but modest
means.''
</P>
<P>
   His departure left dispirited Democratic leaders with just hours
to find another candidate before Friday's final deadline for
getting into the race passed.
</P>
<P>
   They found no one. &QL;

INDIAN LEADERS TALK TO CONGRESS ABOUT NEW POWER TO SHAPE OWN
WELFARE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Victoria Molina wants strangers to stop complaining
about her having babies on taxpayer's money and government workers
to stop asking how she spends that money.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, she wants her children to stop complaining because
there's only enough money for one meal a day.
</P>
<P>
   Now the welfare mother knows how to make it all stop.
</P>
<P>
   And it's going to start with a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   Molina, along with seven other welfare mothers from the Pascua
Yaqui Tribe in Tucson, have learned to use that screwdriver to tear
apart a computer and put it back together.
</P>
<P>
   It's the mothers' first and frightening step in learning to
compete for wealth in a system that often treats them with insult
and indifference.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the first step in a welfare reform program designed by
the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, the first of Arizona's 21 Native American
communities to take charge of its own program to get parents from
welfare to work. White Mountain Apache community's welfare program
started in April.
</P>
<P>
   Tribes throughout the state and country are just beginning to
take advantage of the power and money granted them by the 1996
federal welfare law to customize their own reform programs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 16 Indian-run programs across the nation are
designed to emphasize education and soften the punitive nature of
many state programs. And most are in need of more money.
</P>
<P>
   The Pascua Yaqui Tribe needs computer technicians, so they're
training their own.
</P>
<P>
   By October, some welfare parents in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa
community will be attending desk top publishing or nursing courses.
</P>
<P>
   On the remote Navajo Nation, where jobs and training are scarce,
welfare parents could soon be asked to tend sheep or chop wood for
their elders in exchange for their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation, philosophically, certainly supports the ideals of
personal responsibility and self sufficiency,'' said Virgil Pablo,
a director with the Navajo Nation's Social Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the remoteness on the reservation and limited access to
development in remote and isolated areas, we're in the best
position to say what is appropriate for us,'' Pablo said.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Garcia, who designed the Yaqui program, calls the emphasis
on education the basic philosophical difference between the Yaquis'
program and the state-run program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to prepare parents to be a successful provider, not
someone who lives on the fringes,'' said Garcia, who knows Molina
and many of the mothers in her computer class know how to get a job
and have supplemented their welfare income waitressing and filing.
``These people have always been on the fringes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Garcia said, they want a career.
</P>
<P>
   But if they are to succeed, Arizona Indian leaders told a U.S.
Congressional hearing Friday that Native American governments need
more flexibility, more independence and money, and a sincere effort
by counties and the state to create jobs in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Indian leaders were invited to report their welfare reform
progress and problems to Arizona's Congressman J.D. Hayworth and
Rep. Clay Shaw of Florida, chairman of the U.S. House Ways and
Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, at a hearing in the state
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arizona tribes are grappling with the opportunity to
cushion their members from the harsher blows of the state's welfare
reform and to refocus their own bureaucracies to aid their neediest
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique opportunity the state can't begin to do because
they have thousands of people,'' said Lillia Castaneda, who is in
charge of putting the Salt River community's 250 to 400 adults now
receiving benefits to work. ``They're not numbers to us, they're
people. They're families.''
</P>
<P>
   But it won't work unless scattered tribal bureaucracies learn to
work with each other and with numerous state and federal agencies
distributing bits and pieces of welfare funds, said Eddie Brown,
Associate Dean at the Center for American Indian Studies at
Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   He also isn't sure that the federal government is ready to pay
the price of putting people to work on the nation's poorest
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Native Americans living on reservations that maintain 50 percent
or more unemployment are exempt from the national five-year family
limit on welfare benefits. That limit is pressuring states to move
quickly with reform. Nine Arizona tribes are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   That exemption is a blessing and a curse, said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blessing because it understands that living on a
reservation is not a normal situation,'' said Brown. Expensive
problems that keep people out of work, such as drug and alcohol
addiction, domestic violence, poor education and teen births, and
lack of jobs, are more prevelent in Indian communities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   It's a curse, he contends, because by dropping the five-year
limit, the federal government all but admitted it doesn't want to
pay for solving those complicated problems.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers in the Pascua Yaqui computer class, among 50 parents
who are in jobs or training through the tribe's welfare program,
are the cream of the welfare population, young, smart, articulate
and easily motivated, said Garcia, Social Service director.
</P>
<P>
   He knows many parents will need more time and cost more money to
prepare for work, some are older with more children and less
education and more behavioral health and medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Garcia said, the community has services to help these
families, but some programs, such as childcare, already have
waiting lists. There is little money and staff to help find
families who simply drop off of the welfare roles, perhaps because
of drug, alcohol or domestic abuse problems _ families Garcia is
unwilling to let go.
</P>
<P>
   As Indian communities across the nation struggle with short
funds and a long list of problems, they are watching the Navajo
Nation's legal battle with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the power and money granted to tribes, they still remain
dependent on state-run offices to determine eligibility and
distribute cash benefits for their members.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo Nation wants a block grant that will give it
state-like authority and funding to take over and streamline the
entire welfare program, including eligibility and distribution of
cash benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It wants to avoid entering into agreements with the three
different states its sprawling reservation covers and avoid working
with three different federal regional offices.
</P>
<P>
   While the Navajos continue their legal struggle, the Yaqui Tribe
is implementing a gentler program than the massive one run by the
state, where welfare roles have been slashed nearly in half in a
little more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Yaqui communities, where unemployment is 30 percent, are
still bound by the five-year welfare limit, but they have
eliminated the state-imposed 2-year welfare limit for adults and
will still provide benefits to children born while parents are on
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   While the state program emphasizes quick job placement, the
Yaquis are spending more time and money on education.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe has 350 welfare families, or about 10 percent of its
membership, some of whom live in in Scottsdale and Guadalupe. This
tiny, small-town program can provide face to face encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Molina and her other classmates only agreed to commit to the
two-year computer course after people they knew knocked on their
doors, tapped them on the shoulder, gave them a little push and
took them by the hand to prove to them they could compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jorge (Garcia) came to my house,'' said Molina. ``I was
cleaning. I told him, `I'm not even dressed.' He said, `Just go
like you are.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia drove the nervous Molina to the tribal offices to
interview for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' Molina said. ``I've just been having kids and
staying home and didn't feel I had the knowledge to learn
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina's classmates and teacher said she's now the first to
volunteer to wrestle the insides of a computer she was once afraid
to touch.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Molina's children who keep her coming every day. She
renewed her friendship with her distant 13-year-old daughter with
conversations about computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling everybody `My mom's in computer class. My
mom's building computers.' '' &QL;

8 NATIONS DEMAND END TO SERB ATTACKS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Changes number of aircraft to ``20 to 30'' in 15th graf. No
pickup.)  (th) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Reinforcing the NATO alliance's threat of military
action to stop the violence in Kosovo, the United States, Russia
and six other major industrial democracies meeting in London on
Friday demanded an immediate stop to Serb attacks on ethnic
Albanian civilians in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign ministers of the eight countries gave President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia until Tuesday to call off the offensive. He
is expected to see Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the country
most hesitant to consent to the use of force against the Serbs, in
Moscow that day.
</P>
<P>
   Russia joined Friday in urging Milosevic to use their meeting as
an occasion to announce compliance with other demands made by the
United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The other demands were that Milosevic allow international
monitors unimpeded and continuous access to Kosovo, let refugees
who fled Kosovo return to their homes with international aid and
resume talks with the Kosovo Albanian leadership under Ibrahim
Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 people have been killed in the fighting so far,
international officials believe, and between 60,000 and 85,000 have
been displaced during the Serb offensive in the province, which is
90 percent ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic will be making a grave mistake if he
imagines the international community will be as slow to respond in
Kosovo as it was in Bosnia,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said after the meeting Friday, which was originally called to
coordinate the international response to nuclear weapons tests last
month by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The group of eight countries issued a statement Friday warning
Milosevic that if international demands were not met, there would
be ``moves to further measures to halt the violence and protect the
civilian population, including those that may require the
authorization of a U.N. Security Council resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said, ``We're all
working together as much as we can on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministers also urged the International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia in The Hague to extend its writ to cover
crimes against humanity in Kosovo by Serb commanders and their
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   France, like Russia, has been insisting that before any NATO air
strikes or peacekeeping missions can be undertaken, a Security
Council resolution is needed to authorize the use of force in
Kosovo. The French said Friday's statement indicated that Russia
would deliver a strong message to Milosevic in Moscow next week.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Friday that
Moscow remained opposed to military action, but Hubert Vedrine, his
French counterpart, said, ``I think the Russian position is not yet
their last word.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States believes existing U.N. resolutions regarding
the former Yugoslavia provide sufficient authority for any military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine emphasized the importance of keeping Russia, a
traditional ally of Serbia, in the emerging international consensus
that the world may have to step in to stop the fighting from
spilling over into the rest of the Balkans if Milosevic does not
respond quickly. Russia did agree to the warning the group issued
Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meeting in Belgium on Thursday, NATO defense ministers
commissioned contingency plans for military intervention, including
possible air strikes against strategic military targets in Serbia,
and scheduled a large-scale demonstration of NATO air power across
the border from Kosovo in Albania and Macedonia that could take
place next week.
</P>
<P>
   The British Defense Ministry said Friday that the exercise could
involve some 20 to 30 aircraft from more than six NATO countries,
including Britain and the United States. Russia said it would not
participate.
</P>
<P>
   All except Russia and Japan have banned investment in Serbia and
frozen Serb assets held in their countries, and added an additional
sanction Friday by banning flights by Yugoslav airlines to their
territory. Japan, but not Russia, supported the ban and said it
would consider similar action.
</P>
<P>
   With Rugova, the ethnic Albanian leader, in London for talks
with some of the foreign ministers, the group also said that it
expected him to make clear that it rejected violence and acts of
terrorism, and said it was essential that ``Kosovo Albanian
extremists'' refrain from violent acts that the Serbs could use as
a pretext for continuing their offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright and the other ministers made clear that they
believed Milosevic, not Rugova, was at fault for the premature
suspension of negotiations that had been arranged last month by
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke, who got the United States and
the allies to hold off on economic sanctions so the talks could
begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The violence escalated to such a point that the talks had to
be suspended,'' Albright said, and the United States did not
believe Rugova had any choice but to break them off.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his reaction to the NATO decisions earlier this week,
Rugova said, ``I asked for more, but this is all right.'' &QL;

GIULIANI IGNORES COUNCIL AND MAILS TAX BILLS AT OLD RATE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By MIKE ALLEN     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Giuliani administration announced Friday that it
was ignoring property tax rates set by the City Council this week,
and had begun sending bills to the city's 900,000 property owners
at the old rate.
</P>
<P>
   The council immediately went to State Supreme Court Friday night
to try to stop the mailing, but the administration said most of the
bills had already been sent.
</P>
<P>
   The annual bills include a letter giving Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's account of the rate dispute, which erupted after the
City Council passed next year's city budget without negotiating
with the mayor. The notice, which opens ``Dear Taxpayer,'' accuses
the council of setting the tax rates ``in an invalid and improper
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please be assured that the mayor will do everything in his
power to reduce the City Council's proposed spending and to prevent
the property tax increase that the City Council would otherwise be
imposing on many of you,'' the notice says.
</P>
<P>
   Responding Friday to the mailing, Peter Vallone, the speaker of
the council, called it ``blatantly political, unnecessarily
alarming'' and ``full of falsehoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the decibels of the debate, the two sets of rates would
produce the same amount of revenue. But under the council's
formula, the average owner of a single-family home would pay about
$50 more, while the average owner of a co-op or condominium would
pay about $65 less.
</P>
<P>
   With tax payments due on July 1, some confused taxpayers may
have to wait for a court to tell them how much they will have to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   After the mayor asserted that the council's budget was out of
balance and vetoed many of the members' favorite programs, both
sides predicted that a state court would wind up deciding the
makeup of the budget for the year beginning July 1. First, though,
the tax rates will have to be decided in a separate court case.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McMahon, the council's finance director, shook his head
at what he called ``The Budget War of the Roses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We adopted a legally binding tax fixing, and the
administration's job is to mail out the bills,'' McMahon said. ``If
they insist on ignoring what the council does, a court will have to
decide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Mastro, the deputy mayor for operations, said the bills
had been printed and sent to private mail-order houses, and would
be received by most taxpayers Saturday or Monday. ``The mailing is
largely completed,'' he said. ``There's nothing the council can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Several government watchdog groups said that the notice was a
surprising act of hubris even for a mayor who relishes his
reputation for elbows-out ball. Douglas Criscitello, the director
of the New York City Independent Budget Office, contended that the
mayor was spending taxpayer funds as part of ``a political ploy to
make the council look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   And Conn Nugent, executive director of the Citizens Union of New
York, which has criticized both the mayor and the council for their
handling of the budget, called the politically charged wording of
the notices ``a misappropriation of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor took his case to taxpayers' mailboxes the day after
the council began airing its side in radio ads paid for by the
council leaders' political action committee. Listeners hear the
crack of the bat as an announcer says that Little League had become
``part of the budget battle _ the Giuliani administration versus
your City Council, and your children.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor
this year, referred to the mailings as ``propaganda.'' But the
administration said they were nothing new, since the Department of
Finance had included an explanation of the rate with past bills.
Mastro, the deputy mayor, asserted that this year's notices were
written in ``simple and straightforward language.''
</P>
<P>
   The council's lawyers went to State Supreme Court in Manhattan
Friday night, seeking a temporary restraining order against the
mailing. It was unclear Friday night when the court would act on
the request.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's announcement about the tax bills came after he spent
most of the morning, during his weekly radio show and at a news
conference, assailing the council for what he said was politicizing
the budget process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget has been turned into an election-year budget for
the speaker,'' Giuliani said at City Hall. ``He's been using the
budget as a political pawn.'' &QL;

DE LA HOYA TAKES THE MONEY FOR FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Oscar De La Hoya, this one is about fun. And an easy $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be fighting Patrick Charpentier before 50,000-plus adoring
fans tonight in El Paso's Sun Bowl on HBO. And, remember, he hasn't
fought since December because of an injury to his left wrist. He
misses center stage.
</P>
<P>
   How he could he not be thrilled?
</P>
<P>
   That this is more about idolatry than boxing _ Charpentier is a
20-1 underdog _ makes no difference to the WBC welterweight
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have events like El Paso, it's a big event. And it gets
me excited,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to De La Hoya (27-0, with 22 knockouts) say he's in
prime condition both physically and mentally.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to grow into the 147-pound weight class, where he
plans to stay for a few more years. And, with the exit of Emanuel
Steward, he's been working with venerable Gil Clancy and Roberto
Alcazar, his longtime trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy has impressed upon his protege the importance of sticking
and moving against a limited, but strong opponent whose ascension
to No. 1 contender is dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it doesn't matter. De La Hoya could win this fight
one-handed _ literally. He beat Miguel Angel Gonzalez with only a
stiff jab and Gonzalez is a legitimate contender.
</P>
<P>
   Charpentier (27-4-1, 23 KOs) hasn't lost in four years but has
never faced anyone remotely in De La Hoya's league.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the challenger says _ ``I'm not here to joke. I'm
here to fight and I'm taking the title back to France'' _ the fight
is a joke.
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question: When will De La Hoya get back into the
ring with a deserving foe? A rematch with Julio Cesar Chavez is set
for Sept. 18 at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The fading Chavez will not be a monumental threat at 36 years
old. However, it's a significant step up from Charpentier and will
create considerable international excitement. Chavez's name remains
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if what promoter Bob Arum and De La Hoya say is true, it
won't be long before the champ satiates his critics by fighting
someone with a legitimate chance to beat him: Felix Trinidad, Ike
Quartey or Jose Luis Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: How long?
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he has begun negotiations with Trinidad's handlers and
is awaiting a response to an offer that exceeds $5 million. That
fight probably would take place in May, though.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey is caught up in litigation over his management and
doesn't appear to be in the immediate picture while the much-feared
Lopez doesn't have the drawing power for which Arum is looking, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the prospect of as many as three marginal
challengers before a real test.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who believes he'll have his detractors no matter who
he fights, asks for more patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always people that want to see somebody on top lose,''
he said. ``I even caught myself in that. With the Chicago Bulls, I
said, `I'm tired of them being champions.' It's always going to be
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to see these (legitimate) fights, either... I
will definitely fight the best fighters of my era. It will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, De La Hoya fans will have to be satisfied with an
``event'' rather than a ``fight.''

   Lois Mailou Jones, an American painter and an art teacher for
almost a half century at Howard University in Washington, died at
her home in Washington on June 9. She was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones was an iconic figure, and an important historic link
in a path-breaking generation of black American artists. Her
eclectic, academic work, in a career spanning nearly 70 years,
ranged from impressionistic landscapes to political allegories, and
from cubistic depictions of African sculptures to realistic
portraits.
</P>
<P>
   She was influential as a teacher, not only for her exacting
standards and the encouragement she gave students, but as an
example of persistence in a climate unfavorable to black and women
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones was born in Boston in 1905. Her mother was a
beautician, her father a building superintendent who became a
lawyer. In high school she took evening drawing classes at Boston's
Museum of Fine Arts and she had her first solo show at 17 on
Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. There she met the sculptor Meta
Vaux Warrick Fuller, one of the first artists to use black and
African subjects positively, who encouraged her ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   After graduate study in art and design in Boston, and then a
stint teaching art at Palmer Memorial Institute in Sedalia, N.C.,
Ms. Jones joined the faculty of Howard University in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, her work was included in the biennial exhibition
of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. It was the first of
several appearances at the Corcoran and in other group shows,
though Ms. Jones said that early on she asked white friends to
deliver her paintings to exhibitions, after having had an award
rescinded when it was discovered that she was black.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, while attending a summer session at Columbia
University, she was exposed to the cultural life of Harlem, and
began studying the African masks that would become central to her
best-known paintings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, she received a fellowship to travel to Europe. She
studied in Paris for a year and produced one of her most widely
exhibited paintings, ``Les Fetiches'' (1938), an image of five
African masks rendered in a modernist style. The work has become an
emblem of black American self-identity and is on view in the
exhibition ``Rhapsodies in Black: Art of the Harlem Renaissance''
at the Corcoran Gallery, where a small memorial show of the
artist's work has been organized.
</P>
<P>
   After marrying the Haitian artist Louis Vergniaud Pierre-Noel in
1953, Ms. Jones visited Haiti frequently, and in the 1960s and '70s
she traveled in Africa. There she interviewed contemporary artists
as part of a project sponsored by Howard University titled ``The
Black Visual Artists,'' for which she also documented the work of
artists in the Caribbean and the United States. Both Haitian and
African themes were crucial to her work.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout these years, Ms. Jones taught at Howard University
and elsewhere. She instructed generations of black artists, among
them the contemporary sculptor Martha Jackson-Jarvis and the
painter and collagist David Driskell, and some of whom, like
Driskell, are also teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones retired as professor emeritus from Howard in 1977 but
continued her career as an artist and lecturer, and exhibited in
the United States, Europe and Asia. In 1980, she was one of 10
Africa-American artists honored by President Jimmy Carter for
outstanding achievement in the arts, and she received honorary
degrees from several American colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Her work is in numerous public collections, among them those of
the National Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, the the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington and the Museum of Fine
Art.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' husband died in 1982 and she has no immediate
survivors.

   LOS ANGELES _ Lies, damned lies and statistics:
</P>
<P>
   Just the Lakers' luck. (begin ital)Now(end ital) the Utah Jazz
stops scoring.
</P>
<P>
   It must be luck, right? Because Del Harris did quote the stats
that showed the Lakers had one of the NBA's best defenses....
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson knows he's unqualified to host a late-night talk
show. But it's something to do until he runs for the Senate....
</P>
<P>
   That slogan, ``We Got Next,'' with its
grammatical-rules-breaking, anti-establishment flavor, really
captures the spirit of the WNBA _ a plucky, shoestring enterprise
making its way in the sports world on sheer guts and guile, facing
nothing but resistance from other basketball leagues and from
corporate America, without the benefit of a single
network-television promo to ram the idea down our throats....
</P>
<P>
   All this worry about the future of American literature and then
along comes ``The Quotable ESPN'' (introduction by Charles
Barkley)....
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers must build through the draft. If they try to
improve too fast, they could screw everything up....
</P>
<P>
   When you tire of the complexities of pro sports, there's always
the College World Series, baseball in its purest form....
</P>
<P>
   Junior Seau made the kind of sacrifice a team leader must make
when he cut short a vacation to report to Chargers training
camp....
</P>
<P>
   With the Hideo Nomo trade, all the sunshine went out of the
Dodgers clubhouse....
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Fox Group deal with disgruntled players, you wonder
in retrospect, how big a mistake was not trading Koufax and
Drysdale in 1966?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you can't argue with the results of the recent
trades. If the Dodgers keep winning at their post-Piazza pace, and
the Giants and Padres keep winning at their season-long pace, the
Dodgers will finish within 14 games of first place....
</P>
<P>
   Look up ``class'' in the dictionary, and you'll find a picture
of Hideo Nomo....
</P>
<P>
   When I see that our sports cartoonist dislikes soccer, I worry
about the future of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but 0-0 games _ that's why the World Cup is dying.
</P>
<P>
   If you hate soccer, please don't hesitate to tell everybody,
because your opinion matters.
</P>
<P>
   Strong pregame show on the 5:30 a.m. Paraguay-Bulgaria match.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the ESPN announcers match language and insight with
their British partners makes you proud to be an American....
</P>

   Without baseball's interleague play, an intense regional rivalry
like Houston-Detroit never would have been developed....
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to get excited about the Stanley Cup Finals when the
Kings aren't involved....
</P>
<P>
   What makes Lee Hamilton so likable is his sincerity. ``Thanks
for calling. Have yourself a good evening. You call again.'' Some
radio guys, if they said things like that, would sound like they're
just filling the dead air while they punch up the next caller....
</P>
<P>
   A thought for bodybuilding-magazine publishers: Why not try
exploiting the sex appeal of female fitness competitors?...
</P>
<P>
   No fair laughing at Randy Johnson's appearance. He does the best
he can with it....
</P>
<P>
   What rips the heart out of a boxing fan is when a fight like
Holyfield-Akinwande finally gets made and then it has to be
canceled....
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sports broadcasters, give me the wisdom of guys
who played the game, like Isiah Thomas and Rick Monday, over guys
who didn't, like Bob Costas and Vin Scully....
</P>
<P>
   Bravo to ESPN (The Magazine) for never letting style get in the
way of substance....
</P>
<P>
   Sure, sluggers like Mark McGwire and Juan Gonzalez are flashy,
but give me a lineup full of .300 hitters like Brett Butler any
day....
</P>
<P>
   Casey Martin can win the U.S. Open with any kind of racing
luck....
</P>
<P>
   What makes Yankee Stadium so great, I realized after a visit
last week, is the carnival atmosphere outside the park....
</P>
<P>
   But enough about the 3-year-olds, all my nonracing friends are
saying after the Belmont Stakes excitement. Tell us more about the
fillies-on-turf division!...
</P>
<P>
   Tennis is celebrating this week. The French Open TV rating was
nearly half that of the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   If only tennis could produce some good young players, then it
might be interesting again....
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how Sports Illustrated works, now that the magazine has
done a story on the sportswriting Vecsey brothers, a
Vecsey-brothers video can't be far behind. &QL;

 MISSING `9s' IRKS ARIZONA LOT TERY PLAYERS  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HAL MATTERN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Ruth Wennerlund, like many regular Lottery players,
uses familiar numbers when she purchases tickets. Her son was born
on Sept. 7, so she always bought Pick 3 tickets with the same three
numbers: 9-0-7.
</P>
<P>
   But after a month of playing the popular new game, she noticed
something odd. The number 9 never was selected during the nightly
computer drawings for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really strange,'' said Wennerlund, a Chandler resident.
``So, on Tuesday, I decided to call the Lottery and ask why nine
had never been picked.''
</P>
<P>
   Wennerlund said she was told that Lottery officials had
carefully examined the game and that there were no problems.
</P>
<P>
   So she was understandably surprised Friday morning when she read
in ``The Arizona Republic'' that the game had been suspended
because a computer glitch had left 9 out of the drawings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just so mad,'' said Wennerlund, who only days earlier
had thrown away all of her losing Lottery tickets. ``Why should I
save losing tickets? I don't understand why they didn't catch this
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Wennerlund wasn't alone in her frustration. Lottery officials
said they were bombarded with calls Friday from people who had
bought Pick 3 tickets with the number 9. Several people also have
complained that the computerized drawings in the game were
confusing to players.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials said customers may either mail in the bad
tickets for a refund, including postage costs, or return them in
person to the Phoenix or Tucson Lottery offices.
</P>
<P>
   The nightly Pick 3 drawings were suspended late Thursday because
a programming flaw meant anyone who chose the number 9 had no
chance at the top prize of $500. That digit was left out of the
software that picked the winning numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1.2 million Pick 3 tickets sold at $1 apiece since the
game began May 4, about 76,000 had the number 9.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Katsenes, the Lottery's spokeswoman, said players who
bought tickets with the number 9 may mail them to: The Arizona
Lottery, P.O. Box 2913, Phoenix, AZ 85062.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket-holders may also return them to the Lottery's Phoenix
office, at 4740 E. University Drive, or the Tucson office, at 877
S. Alvernon Way.
</P>
<P>
   Katsenes said the refunds also apply to people who bought
tickets in advance for future Pick 3 drawings regardless of the
numbers they selected.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lottery officials haven't decided when to resume the
game, which was halted after staff members discovered the glitch in
the $1,000 computer software that picked the winning numbers. Elsym
Consulting of Atlanta provided the flawed software to the Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull said Friday that she had ``full confidence in the
people running the lottery.'' And the company works with other
states, she said, where it has a good record.
</P>
<P>
   The big dilemma, Hull said, is what to do about people who
bought tickets with the number 9 but don't have them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will straighten this out as quickly as possible, but we
don't want to lose the impetus of the game,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the popularity of Pick 3 has helped the the
Lottery turn around its lagging sales. Arizona Bingo, which Pick 3
replaced, had lost $1.5 million since it started last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Before the introduction of Pick 3, sales had been running about
3.9 percent behind last year. Now they are 2.6 percent above last
year's figures, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Katsenes said officials are exploring their options, which
include continuing Pick 3 using computer drawings or switching to a
mechanical-ball system that is used for other lottery games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting to fully test the system,'' she said. ``Our
first priority is testing.'' &QL;

FEDERAL JUDGE RULES U.S. GOVERNMENT CANNOT SUE STATE OR CITY
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan ruled Friday that the
U.S. government may not sue the city or state under a special
whistleblower law that would allow it to recover triple damages for
money that the federal government said was fraudulently obtained
for foster care.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was seen as significant because the government
asserted that under the law, known as the False Claims Act, it
could sue the city and state for potential a verdict of about $112
million.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Denny Chin of U.S. District Court in Manhattan did not
come to any conclusion on the merits of the lawsuit, which asserts
that from 1990 to 1994, the city's Child Welfare Administration
fraudulently obtained payments from the federal government after
falsely reporting that services were delivered to thousands of
children in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that the federal government could still sue the
city and state, but only to recover its actual loss, which the suit
placed at about $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called the ruling important, and said,
``The judge understood that applying the False Claims Act's treble
damages provisions to the city would only hurt the taxpayers, and
would do nothing to help better the condition of children in foster
care.'' He continued, ``The city has been making an enormous effort
to provide decent foster care services to children. The decision
will help us to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dennis Vacco echoed those comments, saying that
federal prosecutors had other legal mechanisms, short of seeking
triple damages to recoup money that they believe is improperly
billed.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, whose office in
1996 joined an earlier lawsuit filed by a whistleblower, said that
she was reviewing Chin's decision, but fully intended to pursue the
government's other claims against the city and state ``for their
alleged failure to provide necessary and mandated services to
foster children.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that the issue was pending in another case before
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in which the government used
the law to sue the state of Vermont and addresses similar legal
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the claims under the False Claims Act, Chin said
that the Civil War-era law had been passed to protect taxpayers,
not to ``provide the federal government with a means to punish city
and state taxpayers for the alleged wrongdoing of their local
government officials.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Congress did not intend that cities or states be
subject to the False Claims Act, which traditionally has been used
against defense contractors or other corporations accused of
falsely billing the government for work that was not performed.
</P>
<P>
   A law professor at Columbia University, John Coffee Jr., who has
studied the law, said Friday that the triple damages provision was
designed largely to deter misconduct, whether in the private sector
of the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you rule that the state and city are immune,'' Coffee said,
``That ends much of the incentive for the whistleblower to come
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations that led to the federal suit were raised
initially by Bracha Graber, a former midlevel employee of the city
agency, who, under the whistleblower law, stood to share 15 percent
to 25 percent of any money recovered by the government. Her lawyer,
Carl Loewenson Jr., said that he concurred with Ms. White's
statement, but had no further comment. &QL;

DETROIT RED WINGS: A CHAMPIONSHIP DIMMED, ANOTHER AWAITED
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Detroit and its Red Wings waited 42 years to
celebrate, but their party lasted only six days. It ended with a
terrifying limousine crash one year ago _ on Friday, June 13 _ that
left two men with serious brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov and the trainer
Sergei Mnatsakanov, were riding in the back of the limousine, going
home from a golf outing, the last team function to celebrate the
Wings' first Stanley Cup since 1955. Police said the driver,
working without a valid license, might have dozed off at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months later, the Wings find themselves back in the
tournament finals. When they took a 2-0 lead in the
four-of-seven-game championship round with a 5-4 overtime victory
over the Washington Capitals on Thursday night, they were cheered
on by their two disabled comrades, who viewed from high above the
ice in a private box at Detroit's Joe Louis Arena. Game 3 is in
Washington on Saturday night in the MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   Two more victories will give the Wings their second consecutive
championship. There is a palpable sense around the team's extensive
fan following that another title, without any devastating
aftershocks, would give Detroit a better chance to enjoy the giddy
feeling that ended so quickly last year.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to see or hear much premature joy in the
faces or voices of the Red Wings' stars. The crash left them with a
sober sense of perspective and purpose. They admit that thoughts of
the injuries are never too far from their minds. But they stress
that they do not want to cheapen the tragic event by using it as
motivation for a mere sports contest.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Stanley Cup last June, the Red Wings' captain,
Steve Yzerman, said Friday: ``At the time, we were all thinking
this is the most significant thing that could happen to us. Six
days later, we realized it wasn't. It's not something we use to
motivate ourselves or to generate excitement. It was definitely a
strong reminder that playing hockey is not the most significant
thing that can happen in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman scored two goals Thursday night as the Wings twice came
from two-goal deficits to win in overtime on a goal by Kris Draper.
In his 15th season, Yzerman leads his team in playoff points with
23 and is a strong candidate for the Conn Smythe trophy, which goes
to the tournament's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his teammates, Yzerman plays with a sophisticated
blend of ease and focus. No matter how many mistakes this team
makes, the players seem able to cover up for each other and come
back with resolve. They celebrate goals and victories with
momentary emotion, but there is a cool professionalism about them
most other times.
</P>
<P>
   The limousine accident and its aftermath, Yzerman said,
contributed to the team personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows you to relax and play under control,'' he said. ``We
grew up a lot. We learned a lot. It's changed our perspective at
little for the benefit of our hockey, indirectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Shanahan, another veteran forward, said the anniversary
date ``is not that significant'' because ``we think of them every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do our best not to exploit their injuries to get up for
games or get the crowd going,'' Shanahan said. ``It's friendship.
It's always on our minds, in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   In another coincidence, the driver of the limousine, Richard
Gnida, will be released from prison next Friday. He pleaded guilty
last November to a misdemeanor charge of driving with a suspended
license and was supposed to serve nine months and be released in
August. (He must also perform 200 hours of community service at a
facility for persons who have suffered closed-head injuries.)
</P>
<P>
   But Gnida will get out early because of good behavior as a
prisoner. The judge who sentenced him, Kimberly Small of 48th
District Court in Michigan, said she was not pleased about the
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt he should serve it,'' Small told The Detroit Free Press
for Friday's editions. ``The crime this man committed _ the
suffering he caused _ is very serious. It's frustrating. But the
jail is following the law, and I understand that.''

A GIFT LOST, A LAW SCHOOL DEAN SENT PACKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the brouhaha since the dismissal of the dean of
the Rutgers Law School in Newark earlier this week, the central
question has become: Who lost Dr. Bernard Yudowitz and his promise
of a $4 million donation?
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers president Francis Lawrence said it was the dean of the
law school who let the gift slip through the university's fingers
because he failed to notify top officials early enough about who
the donor was _ Yudowitz is a psychiatrist who runs a chain of
treatment centers in Massachusetts _ and about how much he planned
to give.
</P>
<P>
   The dean, Roger Abrams, said that he handled the process
properly and that it was top university officials who dragged their
feet. He said that on the day in March that he learned of the
potential gift, he told the Rutgers Foundation, the organization
set up to accept such gifts. ``Someone has to tell me how I
mishandled this because I didn't mishandle it,'' Abrams said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks after he initially made his offer to Rutgers,
Yudowitz decided instead to make a donation to Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers is one of about eight law schools that have dismissed or
moved to replace their deans this year, a trend that concerns some
in the legal academic community who worry about what a high
turnover means to the stability of the schools and their reputation
among law school hopefuls and alumni. Some of the dismissals had to
do with money in the high-pressure world of university
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgetown University, for example, the president, the Rev.
Leo O'Donovan, announced in April that he would replace the dean of
the law school, Judith Areen. O'Donovan had reportedly pressured
her to channel to the medical school some of the money that she had
raised. But after an outcry from alumni, faculty and students, the
president backed down from his decision to dismiss the dean.
</P>
<P>
   At Rutgers, the dismissal of the dean also drew widespread
opposition, from the faculty of the law school to the New Jersey
State Bar Association. But the board of governors said Friday that
it was standing behind Lawrence's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The board rejected a suggestion by the law school faculty to
postpone Abrams' removal until after September 1999, when the law
school moves into its new quarters on Washington Street in downtown
Newark. The school is also facing its recertification from the
American Bar Association and is in the midst of a major
fund-raising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is within the president's prerogative,'' said Richard
Levao, the chairman of the board. ``He hired the dean and has the
authority and the duty to relieve the dean of his position when he
considers it necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers officials also said Friday that they did not believe the
dismissal would hurt the law school or the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deans change,'' said Norman Samuels, the provost at the Newark
campus of Rutgers. ``This law school is a first-rate law school.
This is an unfortunate incident, but the institution is much larger
than the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   While both sides argue about whose fault it is that Dr. Yudowitz
turned elsewhere to donate his money, they agree that the matter
did not become contentious until after an article in The Newark
Star-Ledger disclosing a confidential memorandum that Abrams wrote
to his faculty. In that memo, Abrams said that the gift from a
potential donor had been lost because of the ``inept management of
this university,'' when top officials could not give the donor an
answer quickly enough on the terms of their acceptance of his gift.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams did not identify the donor, in keeping with a practice at
the university not to disclose such a name until after a gift is
final. But The Star-Ledger learned Yudowitz's identity and
published his name.
</P>
<P>
   After the article, Lawrence undertook an investigation of the
handling of the Yudowitz gift, and earlier this week, he dismissed
Abrams, who had been dean of the law school for five years. &QL;

 &HT;    Racial crime puts Texas town in national spotlight
 &HT;    By Mitch Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Racism is a problem with which America has tried
to deal for generations and now the brutal killing of James Byrd
Jr., a black man, has put Jasper in the middle of the country's
racial debate, some residents here say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the victim had been white, all this would never have
happened,'' The Jasper NewsBoy Managing Editor Michael Journee said
about the global extent of the media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Racism has not been easy for Jasper residents to talk about in
the crucible of media attention the Byrd murder has drawn. The
horrific nature of the crime has triggered worldwide denouncements
of racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what (the victim's) race was, we still would have
been hurt,'' said Mary Horn, a black Jasper resident and wife of
Jasper Mayor R.C. Horn. During his visit, civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson said it was a good sign for Jasper that its mayor was black
and its sheriff white.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they found Byrd's torso near a cemetery at the
end of a blood splattered three-mile trail. It is alleged Byrd was
beaten, chained to the back of a truck, then dragged. During the
dragging Byrd's head, neck and right arm were severed from his
body.
</P>
<P>
   Three white men _ Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, of Sulphur
Springs, and Shawn Allen Berry and John William King, both 23 and
of Jasper _ have been charged with the Byrd murder and are being
held in Jasper County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   This crime is a throwback to days when it was easier to tell if
someone was being discriminated against. In many cases, racism is
not that easy to identify. One Jasper resident said people
frequently see racism where it isn't and deny racism where it
exists.
</P>
<P>
   In the Byrd slaying, the racist motives seem transparent. Quotes
in the suspects' probable cause affidavit pointed to a racial
motive for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Berry stated in a sworn affidavit that King and Brewer made
numerous derogatory and racial remarks about Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   According to Berry's statement, when the trio picked Byrd up,
King said: ``That's some (expletive) you don't need to be picking
up a (racial epithet).''
</P>
<P>
   According to Berry's statement, just before King and Brewer
began to beat Byrd, King said: ``Fixing to scare the (expletive)
out of this (racial epithet).''
</P>
<P>
   According to Berry's statement, as Byrd's chained body was being
dragged down the roadway, Brewer said: ``That (expletive) bouncing
all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Berry's statement, Brewer said: ``I kicked the
(expletive) out of that (racial epithet).''
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, King told Berry: ``You're just as
guilty as we are. Besides, the same thing could happen to a (racial
epithet) lover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and white agree: it was a very violent crime,'' Jasper
Chamber of Commerce chairwoman-elect Diane Domenech said. ``Whites
in the community feel we need to better the relationship between
the races, but I never felt that black and white don't work well
together here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Jasper and the surrounding areas have experiences
that happened early in their lives that shape their opinions for
life. Some people are just scared that the same thing could happen
to them or someone they love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust white people,'' Jasper resident Ethel Parks
said. ``I was raised not to trust them. My Momma told me they would
turn on you and I've had some experiences like that _ not here, but
in other places. I don't know if I could ever learn to trust
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have taken other lessons from their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Stark, a white resident of Newton, said she was six years
old when one of five black girls who were sisters had a rock thrown
at her. The girl retaliated, Mrs. Stark said, as many children
would. The girl who threw the rock was a white girl, and she went
home to tell her father her side of what happened, and in turn her
father told the sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff came to that black girl's house, Mrs. Stark said,
and ordered the girl's father to take the rawhide whip off the ring
on his front porch and give his daughter 10 lashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cried as he apologized,'' Mrs. Stark said. ``'I'm sorry I
have to do this,' he said. You could see the tears running down his
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I try to make friends with black people because I
know what they've gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   Journee said the real tragedy in Jasper is what has happened to
the Byrd family. The future of Jasper will be what the people make
of it, he said. Jasper is neither a racist town nor is it devoid of
prejudice, Journee suggested. The truth is somewhere in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   When all the cameras have stopped rolling and Jasper is out of
the national spotlight, the city's residents will have an
opportunity to work on race relations, Journee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For good or bad, (when the media leaves) everyone will be much
more aware of race,'' Journee said. ``I imagine there are good and
bad elements to that.''

1 FIREFIGHTER DISMISSED, 2 OTHERS SUSPENDED
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City Fire Department, frustrated in its
investigation of a drunken brawl among its members at a Manhattan
restaurant last week, fired one firefighter and suspended two
others without pay Friday because, investigators say, they were
involved in or witnessed the fight and are telling less than they
know.
</P>
<P>
   Senior fire officials also disputed accounts of the brawl from
some law-enforcement officials, who said that it lasted for hours
and involved 50 to 100 firefighters. Instead, the fire officials
said, more than a dozen witnesses reported that the fight began at
about 10:20 p.m. and that perhaps four to six bloodied men
exchanged punches for 20 minutes before the police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The fire officials also said that no witnesses reported seeing
firefighters expose themselves, and that only one witness, a
bartender, told investigators she had seen firefighters urinating
in the bushes around the Bryant Park Grill's cafe, where many
firefighters gathered the evening of June 3 after attending a
ceremony at City Hall to honor acts of bravery.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the fire officials said that accounts from as many as
18 civilian witnesses they interviewed, and transcripts from
hundreds of police interviews, painted a scene of the uniformed
firefighters drinking heavily, disrupting the cafe's patrons and
refusing to quiet down or leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know these three firefighters were there, and that at least
two of them were involved in the fight,'' said a senior fire
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``And the two
that we interviewed have not been completely forthcoming about what
happened, which is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Though officials believe he was only a witness, James Bruno, 26,
a rookie firefighter who had been on the force only a few months at
Engine 34 in Manhattan, was fired because investigators concluded
that he was withholding the names of those he knew to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him not to have seen anything and not to know anything is
just not believable,'' the senior official said, adding that the
department has more latitude to dismiss probationary firefighters
for misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended indefinitely without pay were Francis Morrisey, 26,
who has been on the force for a year and a half at Engine 319 in
Queens, and Jon-Paul Augier, 24, who has been a firefighter for the
same amount of time at Engine 89 in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Morrisey told investigators that he had been punched unprovoked
by another firefighter as he sat at a table at the cafe and that he
had not fought back.
</P>
<P>
   Fire investigators have been unable to interview Augier because
the Manhattan district attorney's office, for reasons that remained
unclear Friday night, instructed them not to. But fire officials
said he was suspended because the accounts of civilians and
cooperating firefighters placed him at the center of the fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said last week when we had this unfortunate incident, I'm
making every effort to get to the bottom of it,'' said Fire
Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, who took the action against the
firefighters Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach the three firefighters by telephone at home
Friday night were not successful.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lynch, the Manhattan trustee for the firefighters' union,
criticized the disciplinary actions. ``We believe the Fire
Department's actions are to put pressure on people to come forward
with information about this incident,'' said Lynch, who added that,
if necessary, the union will fight in court to win back the jobs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because no civilians have said they were hurt or have filed
criminal complaints, and because the owners of the restaurant have
not formally alleged that property was damaged, the case has been
difficult to investigate. No firefighters have pressed charges
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Fire and police investigators have narrowed down the
firefighters they believe were present by using credit card
receipts and the accounts of patrons and restaurant employees.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual twist, fire officials said they were certain that
Bruno was at the restaurant as early as 7 p.m. that night because
he assisted paramedics at the scene as they treated a male patron
who fainted for reasons that appear to be unrelated to the
firefighters' rowdiness.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said they believed that law-enforcement
officials gave too much credence to the account of Donna Simms, the
general manager of the restaurant, who said that firefighters had
fistfights over several hours, exposed themselves and had turned
over furniture. Fire investigators said Ms. Simms left about 9
p.m., shortly before the restaurant was closed early because of the
noise and disruption.
</P>
<P>
   A man who identified himself as the manager of the Bryant Park
Grill but would not give his name said Friday night that Ms. Simms
was not working and could not be reached until Monday.

LEO BUSCAGLIA, 74, ADVOCATE OF LOVE'S POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Calif., Italy)  (bl) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Leo Buscaglia, the bearded self-help author and cuddly
television guru who preached love with such single-minded fervor
that he seemed unable to stop until he had hugged everyone in
sight, died Friday at his home in Lake Tahoe, Nev. He was 74 and
known variously as Dr. Love, the Love Merchant and the Hug Doctor.
</P>
<P>
   His friend and business manager Stephen Short said the cause was
a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Those who doubt the power of love must not have seen the phone
lines light up when one of Buscaglia's love programs was being
shown on public television during fund-raising weeks in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They surely haven't seen the sales figures for his 15 love
books, five of which were once on the New York Times best-seller
list at the same time, and which together have sold more than 10
million copies.
</P>
<P>
   And they most certainly couldn't have attended one of his
hundreds of love lectures, which typically started with an hourlong
talk and ended with three hours of meeting, greeting and hugging
members of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Buscaglia became so associated with his
spontaneous, big-hearted embraces that he could hardly walk down
the street without having some stranger come up and give him a hug.
(Once, in Toronto, he almost caused as traffic jam when a motorist
stopped his car, jumped out and pinned him in a hug.)
</P>
<P>
   In a world in which he found that a version of love-thy-neighbor
is a part of every major religion, Buscaglia, who knew his
Aristotle as well as anyone, never claimed to be original.
</P>
<P>
   But if his underlying message, that love conquers all, seems
trite, Buscaglia, who frequently quoted Gore Vidal's remark that
truth tends to become platitude, saw his mission not so much as
telling people what they already knew but persuading them to act on
it.
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiasm was so infectious and his own booming love so
obviously genuine that when he asked parents in an audience how
long it had been since they had told their children they loved
them, he could tell by the perplexity on their faces that many
would be making up for lost time when they got home.
</P>
<P>
   If his popularity made him something of a cult hero, Buscaglia
shunned the role. He wasn't a preacher seeking a congregation, he
said, but a teacher trying to inspire people to be, and, yes, love,
their individual selves.
</P>
<P>
   Although he interlaced his philosophy with bits of pop
psychology, as any of his fans could attest, Buscaglia's notions of
love and his zest for life were both grounded in a sprawling,
high-spirited Italian-American family so stereotypical that
Buscaglia could bring tears to his eyes describing his mother
singing at the stove or make his mouth water simply by recalling
spaghetti piled so high on the platter he could not see his sister
across the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Los Angeles whose immigrant parents took him to
Italy shortly after he was born, Buscaglia spent his first five
years in an Italian village. When his family returned to Los
Angeles he spoke fluent Italian, a smattering of French and
Spanish, but not English, a circumstance that led school
authorities to assign him to a class for retarded children.
</P>
<P>
   In his short stay there, as Buscaglia liked to recall, he found
the teacher so warm and nurturing that after he was finally
assigned to a regular classroom he spent the rest of his public
education bored to tears.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Navy in World War II, Buscaglia got a
degree in education from the University of Southern California,
followed it up with a master's and later a doctorate in language
and speech pathology, and worked as a speech therapist in the
California school system until a promotion to an administrative
position left him longing for the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a salary cut to resume teaching, he joined the University
of Southern California education faculty, eventually becoming a
full professor.
</P>
<P>
   Then one of his prize students committed suicide and Buscaglia
became so distraught that he began teaching an unofficial,
noncredit course on life that he called Love 1.
</P>
<P>
   Although his colleagues were skeptical, when the course, which
had been expected to attract 50 students, drew 600, Buscaglia was
off and hugging. With the course regularly ranked as the most
popular at the university, Buscaglia began taking it on the lecture
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   When Charles Slack, a New Jersey publisher of health books,
heard him speak at an education conference, Buscaglia was persuaded
to write a book. The result, ``Love,'' was published in 1972 and
proved so popular that Buscaglia kept on writing, turning out such
titles as ``Living, Loving and Learning'' (1982), ``Loving Each
Other'' (1984), ``Born for Love'' (1992) and finally ``Leo
Buscaglia's Love Cookbook'' (1994), written with Biba Caggiano and
combining Buscaglia's lifelong love of people and food.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister, Marge Macagno, of San Marino, Calif.

 &HT;    Slam in 9th sends Expos by Braves
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Darond Stovall's grand slam in the ninth inning
lifted the Montreal Expos over the Atlanta Braves 7-5 Friday night
at Turner Field, costing Braves starter Greg Maddux his 10th win.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves carried a 5-2 lead into the ninth and opened the
inning with Mark Wohlers on the mound. Wohlers walked the first and
only batter he faced and was pulled by Braves manager Bobby Cox in
favor of Mike Cather. Cather walked a batter and hit another,
loading the bases, then allowed the homer to Stovall.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the first of a three-game series and drew a crowd
of 45,942.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko hit his 11th home run and Eddie Perez drove in two
more runs.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux spotted Montreal an early one-run lead and then held the
Expos to one run and four hits through the seventh. Maddux walked
one while striking out eight. Maddux has allowed just four earned
runs in his last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Javier Vazquez didn't make it to the fifth, after
giving up five runs (four earned) on eight hits. This was a stark
contrast to his first Turner Field appearance May 27, where he also
dueled Maddux through the seventh while allowing only one earned
run.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal closed the Braves' lead to 5-2 with a single run in the
fifth, Jose Vidro picking up a two-out RBI with a single over Walt
Weiss' head, bringing in Mark Grudzielanek from second.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves broke it open with a four-run fourth, much of which
the Expos brought upon themselves. Chipper Jones opened the inning
with an single and Vazquez's next pitch struck Andres Galarraga on
the upper left arm. Following a Klesko foul-out, Andruw Jones
brought in one run for a 2-1 lead with a double off the left field
wall, giving him eight RBI in his last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Perez followed by floating a single just over the head of first
baseman Brad Fullmer's head. Two runs scored for a 4-1 lead as
Perez extended his hit streak to eight games. The play should have
ended there but right fielder Vladimir Guerrero bobbled the ball
once he finally got to it. Perez took off for second and somehow
avoided Grudzielanek's tag.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Maddux hit what should have been an
inning-ending grounder to shortstop, but Grudzielanek committed his
NL-high 16th error, allowing Perez to score for a 5-1 lead.

 &HT;    Galarraga well ahead of team-record HR pace
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Andres Galarraga isn't simply pursuing the Braves'
franchise home run record. He seems to have put it in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, when Eddie Mathews set the club record with 47, he had
20 home runs after 66 games. In 1971, when Hank Aaron tied Mathews,
he had 19 after 66 games. Galarraga had 25 entering Game 67 Friday
night, and had already passed Ryan Klesko's team-leading 24 of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Anything more than 47 would break the record for homers by a
Latin American, which Galarraga currently shares with Texas' Juan
Gonzalez and the retired George Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, I try to play with my own records,'' he said. ``So
if I'm hitting .300, I try to hit .305. I had 150 RBI (last year),
so maybe I can get 151. That helps keep me working on something
every year, trying to get something a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Or a lot more. Entering Friday, he was on track to hit 61
homers, a fact that has been largely overlooked amid the attention
given to Mark McGwire's pursuit of Roger Maris' record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be kind of quiet around (McGwire), but stay close to him,''
Galarraga said. ``That's fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's make a deal
</P>
<P>
   With 21 of their 49 draft picks under contract, including five
of their top 10, the Braves put their best pitch to sixth-round
selection Victor Menocal Friday, letting the unsigned shortstop
from Gainesville High School work out with the team before the
game. Menocal has signed with Georgia Tech, but can sign with the
Braves until he enrolls.
</P>
<P>
   The team in the meanwhile has no intention of signing its first
pick, right-handed Texas pitcher Matt Belisle, until July, when the
condition of his surgically repaired torn left ACL can be better
evaluated. The second-round pick's rehab is three to four weeks
ahead of schedule, according to Birmingham surgeon James Andrews,
who performed the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart expects to return to action tonight after missing
three games while his left shoulder recovers from a double dose of
cortisone. ... Radar guns at John Smoltz's rehab start Wednesday
timed all his fastballs between 90 and 93 mph, which didn't impress
Smoltz. ``If I had to pitch up here, it would have been much
tougher,'' he said. ... Announcer Skip Caray might return to the
booth tonight, though his back is still sore from a spill taken at
his home Wednesday, when he slipped off a treadmill while
exercising and landed on a stationary bike.

JOHN NASSIKAS, 81, WHO LED DEREGULATION OF NATURAL GAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.H.)  (bl) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John N. Nassikas, who as the chairman of the Federal Power
Commission from 1969 to 1975 began deregulation of the natural gas
industry and the shift away from using natural gas to generate
electricity, died of a heart attack June 9 at Georgetown University
Hospital in Washington. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Nassikas, who was responsible for one of largest shifts in
energy use in the nation, presided over a time when there were
shortages of natural gas and concerns that the utility industry
could not build plants fast enough to keep up with the growing
demand for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed by President Richard M. Nixon in 1969 to an agency
that regulated the nation's utilities and natural gas industry, he
thought that less government regulation and market forces were
better suited to supply the nation's energy needs.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, despite opposition from many Democrats and
consumer groups, he was able to orchestrate a doubling of natural
gas rates.
</P>
<P>
   Nassikas argued that producers did not have an incentive to
explore because of the low price. He predicted that despite the
price increase consumers would eventually benefit because more
plentiful supplies would drive the price down.
</P>
<P>
   His policies helped lay the foundation for the gradual
deregulation of the natural gas industry in the 1980s by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which took over the functions
of the FPC. Eventually the process led to lower natural gas prices,
but the trade-off has been that the price now fluctuates.
</P>
<P>
   By increasing the price of natural gas, Nassikas also helped
cause a shift toward development of coal and nuclear plants, which
met with objections by environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   His position was that natural gas, whose reserves were dwindling
during his tenure, was too valuable and scarce a fuel to use for
power generation and should instead be used by industries that need
it to make products and by smaller consumers for heating.
</P>
<P>
   He was also part of an effort spurred by the Arab oil boycott in
1973 that led to huge increases in the price of crude oil to lessen
the burning of oil in the nation's power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate answer, he believed, was not with government
agencies to spur the finding of new reserves of oil and natural
gas, but allowing free enterprise to operate with less regulation.
</P>
<P>
   With energy being one of the main issues at the time, he became
a familiar figure nationally in what had been a largely obscure
agency.
</P>
<P>
   A striking figure, with deep-set eyes that were often framed by
dark circles and black bushy eyebrows, and long graying hair, he
often appeared on Capitol Hill to testify. He once had a heated
exchange with Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., over gas prices, a
dramatic example of the bitter political infighting that went on
over the proposed deregulation of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   His tenure was embarrassed by disclosures that some staff
members of the commissions had owned stocks in companies that were
affected by agency decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu appointed Nassikas
a special public utility commissioner to decide a controversial
refinancing plan for the Seabrook nuclear plant project, and in the
late 1980s he was named by Gov. Judd Gregg to help decide Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire bankruptcy case.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Manchester, N.H., the son of prosperous Greek
immigrant who was a lifelong Democrat. Nassikas, who worked in his
father's ice cream plant wrapping Eskimo Pies, was a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Dartmouth College and got a master's degree in
business administration from Harvard University. He served in the
Navy during World War II. He graduated from Harvard Law School in
1948 and began to practice law in New Hampshire representing
utilities and railroads.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, he went to work on Capitol Hill and was
appointed chief counsel to the Republican minority of the Senate
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview when he was appointed by Nixon: ``I am
challenged by matters of public or social importance. There isn't
anything too small to be uninteresting or anything too large to be
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Deena, of McLean, Va.; four
children, Constance Hohenadel of Charlemont, Mass., Marcy Weathers
of Charlotte, Vt., Elizabeth Lowery of Wallingford, Conn., and John
N. Nassikas III of McLean, and 12 grandchildren.  &QL;

NEW TRIAL GRANTED IN DAY-CARE SEX-ABUSE CASE  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change ``granted a new trial'' in the 2nd graf to
``affirmed a ruling that a new trial be granted.'' Explains this in

 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Handing a major victory to the defense in one
of the country's longest-running day-care sexual abuse cases, a
Massachusetts judge ruled Friday that the children in the case had
been so manipulated in interviews with investigators that their
testimony was ``forever tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that ``justice was not done,'' Judge Isaac Borenstein
of Superior Court affirmed a ruling that a new trial be granted to
Cheryl Amirault LeFave, one of three family members convicted more
than 10 years ago in the highly publicized Fells Acres Daycare
Center case.
</P>
<P>
   But the aspect of Borenstein's decision that may have the
broadest implications for other cases around the country,
prosecutors said, was his ruling that in Ms. LeFave's new trial,
the children, whose evidence made the prosecution's case, could not
testify.  &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's concerning because not only did he determine that the
interviews in the case were improper, he determined that the
children could not testify,'' said Lynn Rooney, chief of the Family
Protection Unit in the Middlesex County district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in effect found her not guilty, because without the
children, we don't have a case that we can prosecute,'' Ms. Rooney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LaFave and her mother, Violet Amirault, were convicted in
1987 and sentenced to 8 to 20 years in prison. But they were
released in 1995 when another judge ordered a new trial, finding
that the court's seating arrangement had kept them from confronting
their accusers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Borenstein dismissed all charges against Ms. Amirault
_ posthumously. She died of cancer last September at 74 while free
awaiting a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution will appeal the ruling to the Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court, Ms. Rooney said, and if the appeal fails,
will consult with the families involved about whether they could
endure another trial. The Supreme Judicial Court, the state's
highest court, ruled against such a new trial for the Amiraults in
the past, apparently seeking to close the 14-year-old case.
</P>
<P>
   Fells Acres is one of the last cases pending among the wave of
major day-care sexual-abuse trials in the 1980s _ including those
involving the McMartin preschool in California, the Little Rascals
Day Care Center in Edenton, N.C., and the Wee Care Day Nursery in
Maplewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the convictions in those cases have been overturned
as questions have mounted over whether interviewers had prodded
suggestible children into fabricating stories of abuse. But
advocates who work on behalf of defendants said that Friday's
ruling might help the scores of people falsely accused of child
sexual abuse in day-care or custody cases who remain in jail.
</P>
<P>
   James Sultan, Ms. LeFave's lawyer, said that when the Amirault
case was tried, ``it was really the dark ages of child sex abuse
investigations, and people didn't know how to question children
properly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And at the time,'' he said, ``the prevailing wisdom was that
you really had to push and prod, and `Don't take no for an answer'
was the mantra of the investigator at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he argued successfully in the court this year, more
than a decade of research has shown that children are so
suggestible that they tend to give questioners answers that seem to
be wanted, and then believe what they said. The 1993 exoneration of
Margaret Kelly Michaels in the Wee Care case also hinged on flawed
interviews, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein had viewed videotapes of the children's
interrogations, and on Friday read aloud excerpts of transcripts in
his ruling to show how the questioners pushed children to give
certain answers.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he said, ``On and on and on, refusing to take `no'
for an answer, and it's only one example of the overwhelming
evidence in this case of how investigators, however
well-intentioned, just would not take no, and overwhelmed these
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan said the ruling held particular promise for the third
defendant in the Amirault case, Ms. LeFave's brother Gerald
Amirault, who is in prison serving a sentence of 30 to 40 years
after being convicted in 1986 on the same evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Amirault, who was an aide and driver at the Malden, Mass.,
day-care center that his mother ran for more than 20 years, was
accused of taking the center's children, who were 3 to 5 years old,
into a ``magic'' or ``secret'' room to molest them.
</P>
<P>
   Children told investigators that they had been tied naked to a
tree, attacked by a clown, raped with objects and forced to watch
the Amiraults kill birds.
</P>
<P>
   Though the news was good for Ms. LeFave Friday, she cried in
court ``because her mom wasn't there to hear this vindication,''
Sultan said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ms. LeFave told reporters that the judge ``validated
everything that my family has been fighting for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any abuse in Fells Acres,'' she said. ``And,
my God, my mother, God rest her soul, her business was taken from
her. My mother created a community in Malden that was _ impeccable.
And I'm here to raise her name.''

DE LA HOYA BECOMES MUCH MORE THAN BOXER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ Ali had Frazier. Sugar Ray Leonard had Roberto Duran
and Thomas Hearns.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya?
</P>
<P>
   He has it all.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs dangerous rivals?
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has parlayed movie-star looks, an Olympic gold medal,
camera-friendly charisma, innate salesmanship and a disarming smile
into success previously unknown in a sport where the big winners
pay a punishing price.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya hasn't had to pay. For him, there are none of the
scars that other fighters have always worn like a combat veteran
with a Purple Heart. For them, there is victory in survival. But De
La Hoya already has won a lot more than that.
</P>
<P>
   The proof is in his amazing impact on El Paso and Juarez,
Mexico, during the days before he defends his World Boxing Council
welterweight title tonight against a little-known Frenchman,
Patrick Charpentier.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the fight. It's just the last stop in one long parade
with one example after another of De La Hoya's huge popularity,
despite lingering doubts about him as a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, look, I'm not expecting Armageddon here,'' said Bob Arum,
the promoter for the heavily favored De La Hoya (27-0, 22
knockouts), who was 147 pounds Friday at the official weigh-in.
Charpentier (27-4-1, 22 KOs) tipped the scale at 146, one less than
the welterweight limit.
</P>
<P>
   No, Arum is only expecting the largest outdoor crowd for a
boxing match in the United States in 43 years. About 45,000 tickets
had been sold by Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   With 50,000 to 60,000 customers expected by opening bell (7 p.m.
on Home Box Office), the Sun Bowl crowd would be the biggest in the
United States since 1955, when Rocky Marciano beat Archie Moore in
front of 61,500 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning difference is that De La Hoya vs. Charpentier is
hardly Marciano vs. Moore. This is more like iceberg vs. Titanic.
It's a colossal mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the crowds are here just to see De La Hoya, who will pocket
$4 million to Charpentier's $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fans flew in from Phoenix. They drove down from Albuquerque.
They walked over the bridges that cross the Rio Grande from Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by having the event here has me motivated,'' said De La
Hoya, who has been inactive since a victory Dec. 6 over Wilfredo
Rivera. ``All the people, all the fans. It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's status as a Latin sex symbol is the key. He may _
or may not _ be the world's best fighter, pound for pound. But
heartbeat for heartbeat, he has no challengers.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 shrieking girls greeted him a couple of days ago
when he stepped off his jet at a private El Paso airport. They
chanted, ``Oscar, Oscar.'' Some carried his picture in one hand as
though it were a religious item. Others reached through a
chain-link fence in an attempt to touch him. They threw underwear
at him. De La Hoya autographed at least one brassiere. No word yet
on whether he'll endorse a Victoria's Secret line.
</P>
<P>
   All those young women aren't there to see that face get bloodied
and bruised. And for now, De La Hoya doesn't appear to be in a
headlong rush toward that dangerous possibility.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest threats are International Boxing Federation
champion Felix Trinidad (32-0) of Puerto Rico, World Boxing
Association champ Ike Quartey (34-0-1) of Ghana and emerging
contender Jose Luis Lopez (40-3-2) of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he has talked to Trinidad about a fight in May. Money,
he said, has been discussed. From $7 million to $8 million would go
to each fighter, with De La Hoya getting a larger share of the gate
and television receipts.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very intriguing. The young Trinidad looms as a bout in
which De La Hoya, 25, could define himself as a truly great
fighter. A rematch Sept. 18 against an aging Julio Cesar Chavez,
badly beaten in the first bout, does not hold that promise.
</P>
<P>
   But why, oh why, tamper with success? De La Hoya earned $36
million to $38 million for five fights last year. ``Fortune''
magazine lists him as the world's third-highest-paid athlete in
1997 behind Michael Jordan and Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an agenda, a schedule,'' according to De La Hoya, who
said he eventually will meet Trinidad and possibly Quartey. ``There
is no rush.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to. Just look around. &QL;

FOR SALE: PLAYERS DEAL JERSEY NUMBERS FOR PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. -  &UR; Thomas Guynes' mother didn't raise a dummy.
</P>
<P>
   When Cardinals offensive guard  &UR; Lester Holmes asked if Guynes
would give him uniform No. 71, Guynes said he would be happy to
oblige for the right price.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a graduate of the University of Michigan, I felt equipped
from going through the best educational process to make the wisest
and most discerning decision,'' said Guynes, a second-year
offensive lineman. ``Being that I had no real attachment to 71,
that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Guynes then sold Holmes No. 71 and took No. 70.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate  &UR; Ty Howard, who wore No. 29 last year, made a similar
deal.
</P>
<P>
   He sold running back  &UR; Adrian Murrell No. 29 and took jersey No.
27.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a business proposition I couldn't turn down,'' said
Howard, a second-year cornerback from Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like 29, either. But I didn't tell Murrell that.'' &QL; 
Sock hop &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft pick  &UR; Andre Wadsworth has worn his socks over
his football cleats at this week's rookie camp, a habit he picked
up at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to feel warm,'' said Wadsworth, a 6-foot-4, 278-pound
defensive end. ``The hotter I get, the more sweaty, the better I
feel. It makes my feet warm.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another reason he does it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deion went to Florida State,'' Wadsworth said of Dallas
Cowboys cornerback  &UR; Deion Sanders. ``He always said, `You want to
look good, because if you look good, you feel good. If you feel
good, you play good. If you play good, you get paid good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As the third pick in last April's draft, Wadsworth will become
an instant millionaire when he signs.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle cornerback  &UR; Shawn Springs, the third pick overall in
1997, signed a deal worth $2.2 million a year. &QL; 
Huge fan &QL; 
 &UR; Roy Green, the Cardinals' all-time leading receiver, has a new
favorite rookie on the team.
</P>
<P>
   It's second-round pick  &UR; Corey Chavous, who earlier this week
changed his uniform number from No. 43 to No. 25 because it was
Green's number as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who the best player in the draft is, but I know
who the smartest is _ Corey Chavous,'' Green said of the safety
from Vanderbilt. &QL; 
Crowded room &QL; 
Rookie linebacker  &UR; Aaron Collins is one of 19 children, the
youngest of five sons who played at Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   He has 12 sisters and six brothers, ranging in age from 45 to
19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom's a trouper,'' said Collins, a 6-foot, 237-pound native of
Cinnaminson, N.J. ``She's strong. She took care of us. And Dad
worked hard to pay the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the family tries to get together once a month. ``But
everyone won't be at the same (dinner) table except Thanksgiving,''
said Collins, whose brother,  &UR; Andre, recently signed with the
Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up with so many kids really wasn't as tough as you'd
think. There always was someone to hang with, someone to talk
to.'' &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
Cardinals starting quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer, among the veterans
who attended this week's rookie camp, will miss some of next week's
practices to attend the wedding of his brother,  &UR; Brett, in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer will be at HoHoKam Park this morning in Mesa, directing
a free clinic for kids. The session will runs from 9 a.m. until
noon. Advance registration is required.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have learned that the most compensatory picks they
can receive in next year's draft for losing free agents is four.
The picks will come at the ends of Rounds 3 to 7.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals wide receiver  &UR; Rob Moore, whose contract will be up at
the end of the 1998 season, has switched agents again. He has gone
back to his original agent,  &UR; Gary Wichard. &QL;

RESTROOMS OPEN AT LAKE PLEAS ANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The two new restroom facilities at Lake Pleasant's
10-lane boat ramp now are completely functional.
</P>
<P>
   The restrooms, complete with running water, flush toilets, sinks
and outside spigots (but no way to dry your hands), were badly
needed at this extremely popular launch site in Maricopa County's
Lake Pleasant Regional Park.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lighting has been installed at the ramps. After a
catfishing trip to the lake this week that ended at nightfall, I
can attest that both the restrooms and the lights are welcomed _
the restrooms for obvious reasons, the lights because they provide
a homing beacon and illumination for prepping a boat for launch and
for preparing it to go home.
</P>
<P>
   The lake's popular scenic overlook also is open to the public
again after a closure to construct water lines to the new restrooms
and to Roadrunner Campground.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes at a perfect time, as KGME-AM (1460) radio's $1
million bass fishing tournament will conclude near those ramps at
about 5 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   The station is offering $1 million to anyone who catches a state
record bass between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. today. The largest five-bass
limit weighed in is worth $1,000, the largest bass $750 and the
second-largest $500.
</P>
<P>
   Those prizes are available only to those who have paid a $35
entry fee. &QL; 
More Lake Pleasant &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An 1,800-acre closure in the Agua Fria River at Lake Pleasant,
imposed to help nesting bald eagles at the lake, will be opened
again Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The area is closed during the nesting season to help protect
eagles from harassment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, one pair of breeding eagles reproduced. The area
averages one or two successful hatches each year.
</P>
<P>
   The buoy lines and signs marking the closure will be removed
about 7 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the Lake Pleasant area has produced about 5 percent
of all eagles hatched in Arizona. &QL; 
Arizonan in money &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Taylor Hutchings of Phoenix finished 15th in the 15th annual
Red Man All-American Bass Fishing Championship on the Mississippi
River near LaCrosse, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty of the top anglers in the nation competed in the three-day
tournament. They qualified through regional tournaments. After the
first two days, the top 10 anglers qualified for the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchings, in his two days of competition, caught 14 pounds, 14
ounces worth of bass and won $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was  &UR; Kim Carver of Milledgeville, Ga., who caught 32
pounds, 8 ounces in three days of fishing. He won $100,000. &QL; 
Feeding frenzy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although largemouth and smallmouth fishing has dropped off at
Lake Powell, striped bass are on a feeding frenzy, according to
 &UR; Wayne
 &UR; Gustaveson, the Utah fisheries biologist who is considered to be a
guru on Lake Powell fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Because of heavy snowpack in the Rocky Mountains, Powell is
close to filling. The stripers are feeding heavily on plankton, a
small organism, because shad are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Because getting enough to eat is difficult with the smaller
forage, a frozen anchovy or a bright spoon dropped among the
stripers is deadly.
</P>
<P>
   The stripers are found in 15 to 30 feet of water. They generally
are found near prominent points and must be located with sonar. &QL;

VIDEO'S DASH FOR CRASH  
 DRIVERS SPLIT OVER APPEAL OF MAYHEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two stock car drivers dive side by side into Turn 1, each
determined to claim the same piece of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Unless one softens up on the throttle, there will be hell to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   No one budges.
</P>
<P>
   A second later, the machines trade paint, causing one to slide
into an uncontrollable twirl. The spinning car suffers a snapped
brake line and bursts into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, who is eyeballing a replay of the crash on
television, leans forward in his living room chair and blurts,
``That's me!''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of crash-and-smash video, where catchy
commercials featuring countless nasty wrecks are the staples of
motor racing junkies hooked on mechanical mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, some of the video's most fervent fans are the
sport's main players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a whole library full of them,'' NASCAR Winston Cup
driver Ken Schrader says. ``In most of them, it looks like they
(the drivers) are able to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon suffered no injuries in the crash he saw during a
commercial for one of the videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened at North Wilkesboro,'' Gordon says. ``I've seen a
few of my wrecks when I still was racing midgets and sprints. I
don't mind watching them if I know no one was seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them really amaze you. Like those airplane crashes.
I'm interested, but I've never bought them.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't put Winston Cup driver Derrike Cope in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't pay attention to that stuff,'' Cope says. ``I'm
one of those guys that won't read what's written and I try not to
watch too much on TV. I very seldom even watch races over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup driver Dale Jarrett agrees with Cope, even if he
knows a driver was able to walk away from the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why people want to see that,'' Jarrett
says. ``I'm glad the drivers walked away, but it's still not
something I want to see or even think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people make a living by putting pieces like that
together, but it would be nice if they made more pieces about the
good things that go on in the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup driver Bobby Hamilton, however, can envision a lot
worse things for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people make money doing a lot worse things,'' Hamilton
says. ``I think its pretty cool to sit around, drink a beer and
watch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hewitt, who made his Indy-car debut in last month's
Indianapolis 500, believes there's a market for such videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think half the fans that come to races come to see
the big crashes and fights,'' says Hewitt, who adds that he doesn't
see anything wrong with the videos. ``They love it. They're here
for the blood and guts. It's kind of like the World Wrestling
Federation to them. I don't think they want to see anyone get hurt,
but when they see a crash, it seems to pump them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they see a good race and a crash, it's perfect. But you
can't hold it against them. They pay big bucks to come to the
races. Crashing thrills people. It's unfortunate, but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Open-wheel driver Dan Drinan, who nearly died six years ago in a
horrific crash in a U.S. Auto Club midget race at Springfield,
Ill., dislikes the videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it when people sensationalize tragedies,'' says
Drinan, who attended Scottsdale Chaparral High school but now lives
in Indianapolis. ``In my crash, I had a finger chopped off, it tore
my arms up, my elbow was dislocated and my face was all messed up.
I lived through that horrendous crash, but I was lucky. Stuff like
this hits too close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I really don't think the majority of fans come to see
crashes. I think it's the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian France, NASCAR Vice President for Marketing and
Communications, strongly agrees. France, however, also agrees that
there are exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest moments in NASCAR's 50-year history aren't about
crashes,'' France says in reference to NASCAR's 50-year anniversary
celebration. ``They're about things like memorable finishes in the
Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we recognize that fans are fascinated by dramatic crashes
from time to time. But it's not what our sport is about. We like to
focus on the competition between the drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, sometimes, the competition can lead to a fiery end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see wrecks a little more often than the average person, so
it's not that big a deal for us,'' Gordon says. ``But if someone
gets hurt real bad, it's not something you enjoy watching over and
over again on a video.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody enjoys that.'' &QL;

   Poor Dale Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett was socked twice Saturday in the waning moments of the
Pontiac Excitement 400 at Richmond International Raceway, arguably
costing the Ford Quality Care driver the NASCAR Winston Cup
victory.
</P>
<P>
   First, NASCAR officials decided to red flag the race seven laps
from the finish, allowing course workers time to clean debris and
oil from Turn 2, the site of a multicar crash on Lap 393.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's intention was to create a green flag finish for fans.
But in doing so, Jarrett, who was leading, became a victim. Had
officials displayed a yellow flag and not red, the race likely
would have ended under caution and Jarrett would have been crowned
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the race resumed, Jarrett and Labonte began a fierce
battle for the lead. On Lap 398, two laps from the checkered flag,
Jarrett lost it.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte squeezed by after first bumping Jarrett with his Chevy
Monte Carlo, and won when, ironically, a Johnny Benson crash
coinciding with the Labonte-Jarrett tussle forced the race to end
under caution.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett still might have been able to fend off Labonte, but he
was operating with older tires that had become cold during the race
stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not against finishing the race under green,'' Jarrett
said Tuesday. ``As a matter of fact, that's what the fans deserve,
and we're very conscious of that. As much as we want to say we're
just there to race and enjoy what we're doing, it is a show and
they (NASCAR) have an obligation to put on the best show for the
fans and the TV audience that they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``After talking with them and understanding their position, and
realizing it was a call they had to make in a span of about 10
seconds, they did what they thought was right for the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   But it cost Jarrett dearly.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Vice President for Competition Mike Helton said the
cleanup took 13 to 14 minutes, which would have encompassed 12 laps
had there not been a red flag.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Jarrett and Labonte slam dance, Helton said NASCAR
determined it ``just a racing incident.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be just a racing incident to NASCAR, but to Jarrett, it
was a racing incident that likely will have repercussions down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you put in the back of your mind,'' Jarrett
said. ``He (Labonte) didn't take me out. He hit me pretty hard, but
to say if we're racing side-by-side at Michigan (on Sunday) I'm
going to rough him up or anything, no, I'm not saying that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's something you put in your memory bank and at
an opportune time, yeah, you may be a little bit rougher. But it's
not a matter that I'm going to go out and wreck Terry Labonte
because I don't intend on doing that. That's not the makeup of
NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I have to use the bumper a little bit at some point in
time, then that's what I'll have to do.'' &QL;

CART, IRL STILL FAR APART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was late afternoon. The infield media room at Indianapolis
Motor Speedway nearly was deserted except for a few reporters, who
had  &UR; Tony
 &UR; George surrounded two days before last month's 82nd Indianapolis
500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony, do you foresee a Championship Auto Racing Teams and Indy
Racing League reconciliation?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony, do city fathers blame you for empty hotel rooms because
of the CART vs. IRL split?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony, do you anticipate CART drivers one day again converging
at Indy in May to do battle against IRL drivers in a one-day
shootout?''
</P>
<P>
   Yada, yada, yada.
</P>
<P>
   While fans and sponsors likely would embrace a CART-IRL merger,
chances of such a partnership are about as remote as peace in the
Middle East. Or so it seems.
</P>
<P>
   George, president of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, created the
IRL three years ago because he believed the sport was heading in
the wrong direction and wanted to establish an affordable series
that rewarded young American drivers with Indy-car opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as CART continues to expand its racing borders to
venues outside the United States, the IRL remains committed to an
all-oval series.
</P>
<P>
   Even if CART teams desired to make Indy 500 qualifying attempts,
several roadblocks _ primarily thin wallets _ make it virtually
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two sanctioning bodies operate under different
chassis and engine formulas, CART owners would have to purchase
separate equipment at a huge cost.
</P>
<P>
   And the last time I looked,  &UR; Bill Gates wasn't listed as a CART
car owner.
</P>
<P>
   So get used to it, folks. Although rumors along pit road
indicate CART driver  &UR; Al Unser Jr. may wind up on next year's Indy
500 starting grid, there are no clear signs the factions are about
to sign a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tries to characterize this as the IRL trying to keep
drivers away,'' George said. ``Drivers really don't have a lot to
say or do about the situation. I'm sure they miss being here. Some
probably don't know what it's like being here because they've never
been here. So they don't miss it. I know there are a couple who
very much want to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   George is wrong. Ask any CART driver, and under the right
circumstances, they'd all love to make plans in May at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   But as George insinuated, CART drivers get their paychecks from
CART owners, and we all know what that means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I think everyone will come to appreciate the IRL
for what it represents, and that is the opportunity to come and
compete at a reasonable level and be a part of putting on a good
show,'' George said.
</P>
<P>
   No one can argue last weekend's race at Texas Motor Speedway
didn't deserve high marks on the thrill-o-meter. It was an exciting
race, breathtaking at times.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers provided enough side-by-side racing to satisfy even
stock-car fans.
</P>
<P>
   But while it's wonderful to see talents such as  &UR; Billy Boat and
 &UR; J.J.
 &UR; Yeley receive opportunities they likely would not have received
without the IRL, it's the opinion of many that the Indy 500 has
taken a huge whack in the prestige department.
</P>
<P>
   And I agree. &QL; 
Schedule expanding &QL; 
Rumors that a NASCAR Winston Cup race at Homestead (Fla.)
Motorsports Complex will be added to next year's schedule escalated
into a newspaper report earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a possibility of growing or shrinking, but it's
still too early to address 1999,'' NASCAR Vice President for
Competition  &UR; Mike Helton said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now I've got a rumor I want to start.
</P>
<P>
   How about a second race at PIR within three to five years? It
would be a night race, possibly held in May or June.
</P>
<P>
   International Speedway Corp., which owns PIR, just renewed its
contract with The Nashville Network for three years at a huge
increase. And ISC would like to add 25,000 additional seats within
five years, which would increase seating capacity to nearly
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   A long shot? Perhaps. But who would have believed 15 years ago
that PIR would one day become part of the Winston Cup schedule? &QL; 
Sing, sing &QL; 
Country music heartthrob  &UR; Randy Travis will sing the national
anthem at the NASCAR Winston Cup Dura-Lube 500 on Oct. 25 at
Phoenix International Raceway. &QL;

OUTDOORS: WOMEN BRIDGING GAP AS KEYS FISHING GUIDES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The next time you head to the Florida Keys looking for someone
to guide you to a bonefish, tarpon or big grouper, you might be
surprised to find that your options have widened. A growing number
of women have become professional guides.
</P>
<P>
   The invisible ``glass captain's ceiling'' has been broken by a
handful of exceptionally qualified women who are becoming some of
the Keys' best fishing guides.
</P>
<P>
   Their course has not been easy. It is not that charters object
to female captains, but the extreme competitiveness between
skippers _ regardless of gender _ leaves little room even for
well-qualified women. If you do fish with a woman as your guide,
you will be impressed because she has crossed more hurdles to get
there than some men may have.
</P>
<P>
   THE place for a woman to look for work as a captain is the Keys,
the string of loosely connected coral islands that offers anglers
and would-be captains offshore fishing, flats fishing and
back-country fishing in Florida Bay. During the past few years,
nearly a dozen women have moved to the Keys, earned their Coast
Guard master's papers, and are now making a living guiding; half of
them are full-time guides. Most are thirtysomething, but a few are
older.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Lori Parker, 33, came to the profession through the back
door. She has been a steady fixture in the Keys since she was 16,
when her father, Captain Jack Kelly, moved there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fishing my entire life,'' she said. ``Maybe it was
my father's love of fishing that imbued me. I caught my first
tarpon when I was 8. Dad strapped me into the chair and yelled,
`Get him, wimp.' I was small for my age, but I beat the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker got her license when she was just 19. ``It wasn't easy,''
she said. ``When I took the test, I was the only woman in a cramped
room filled with men. I heard a lot of snickering going on behind
me before the exam started. It unnerved me. I psyched out. Failed
it, but went back a second time and made it.''
</P>
<P>
   She began as a dive-boat mate, then spent a couple of years as a
skipper out of Boog Powell's marina. For the next seven years, she
worked as a mate on sport-fishing boats. ``My last job as a mate
was on an offshore boat,'' she said. ``The captain's wife, Linda
Luzzia, was a friend and a tarpon guide. If she could do it, so
could I.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker's father, who still guides out of Key West, helped her
buy and outfit her boat. Today, father and daughter often fish
together and daily share fishing information, via cellular phone,
when they are out of sight. She has guided full-time for the last
six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband, Ken, is in the refrigeration business and shares
my love of fishing,'' said Parker, who has a 6-year-old son. ``I
lead a normal life, like any other woman and mother who is working
or has a career. I pick up my son from the baby sitter at the end
of a trip. I clean house for a while then start dinner so it's
ready when Ken comes home. The only difference between me and other
career women is that my profession is a full-time fishing guide. It
IS my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker has made a specialty of fishing for tarpon in the deeper
channels around Key West and wreck fishing offshore. ``Because I
now compete for customers, a few guides resent me and continually
give me a hard time,'' she said. ``Most, however, don't. Many even
go out of their way to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker said she has had only one ``character'' resent her
because she was a woman. ``He wanted to fish a reef in the gulf,''
she said. ``He was with his family, and the weather was too bad for
safe fishing. Seas were rough and building. I refused to go. He
said it wasn't the weather, that I was chicken: `A woman should be
in the kitchen, not running a boat.' He chartered a bigger boat and
went to the reef. Everyone got seasick, and the skipper cut short
the charter.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Captain Donna Van Kirk, 42, of Marathon, Fla., started fishing
in New Jersey when her husband, Jim, a commercial fisherman, taught
her to chase blues and striped bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``When commercial fishing started to fall off 13 years ago, we
came to the Keys,'' she said. ``Jim trapped lobsters, and I fished
for fun. I worked the flats taking bonefish and permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most tarpon pile up in holes scoured around bridge
abutments,'' she continued. ``That's where I take my fares. I've
been flats fishing for 15 years but only began guiding in '94.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because Van Kirk is older, or because captains in Marathon
on Vaca Key are less competitive than those in Key West, she has
had little trouble gaining acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always friendly, talk to them, and wave when we pass on
the water, but I keep pretty much to myself,'' she said. ``I still
have a 17-year-old daughter to raise, and she fills my off-water
time. Who knows, maybe after she runs through these terrible teens,
she, too, might want to become a fishing guide.''

SEIZED FREIGHTER MAY HAVE BEEN SMUGGLERS' `MOTHER SHIP'
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By SUSAN SACHS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the seizure of a freighter that is suspected of smuggling
Asian immigrants into the Bahamas this week, federal officials said
they were beginning to piece together the circuitous journey of 23
Chinese men who illegally landed on a New Jersey beach two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 120-foot-long ship seized in the Caribbean, the Oriental I,
may have been a so-called mother ship used in one phase of a
smuggling operation involving many vessels, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The Oriental I, now in the custody of the U.S. Coast Guard, was
intercepted about 195 miles east of San Salvador Island on Monday.
Only an eight-man crew _ comprised of four Venezuelan and four
Korean nationals _ was on board at the time it was seized. But the
day before, U.S. Customs officials, watching from an airplane, saw
a group of people leaving the ship in a speedboat, which raced them
to Abaco Island in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Bahamian police were alerted and later found 24 Asian men _ 23
from China and one from Malaysia _ hiding near the island town of
Hole in the Wall. Those men have been detained as illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say they believe the freighter, which is
registered in Venezuela, also played a role in the smuggling of the
Chinese immigrants who were dumped on the beach at Bay Head, N.J.,
on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants had traveled near the U.S. coast on the Oriental
I and were then transferred to a smaller boat, the Oops II, the
authorities said. But the Oops II lost its way in dense fog and ran
aground, leaving the immigrants to jump into the surf and flee
toward the mansions lining the shore of the wealthy town.
</P>
<P>
   The men were rounded up over the next few days and taken to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service detention center in
Elizabeth, N.J. The immigrants' lawyers have said they will all ask
for political asylum because they fear persecution in China.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they doubted that either group of immigrants _
those who ended up in New Jersey and those who were caught in the
Bahamas _ had traveled all the way from China on the freighter.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for one of the immigrants who landed in New Jersey said
that the smuggling route began in South America, the Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guy's trip took about two months,'' said the lawyer, Jules
Coven. He said his client, Dian Lu Jiang, flew from China to
Suriname, a country on the northeast coast of South America, before
boarding the first of three boats involved in the trip.

METS HAND GAME TO MARLINS, 4-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The New York Mets did something Friday night they rarely
have done this season: They gave a game away.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Dunwoody's infield single up the middle off second baseman
Carlos Baerga's glove scored Craig Counsell from third base with
two out in the ninth to give the Florida Marlins a come-from-behind
4-3 victory. The loss spoiled the Mets' chances of reaching a
season-best 12 games over .500; they are 36-26.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Marlins' second two-out rally in two innings. And it
made a loser of Brian Bohanon, who has been thrust into a set-up
role ever since Greg McMichael was sent to Los Angeles as part of
the Hideo Nomo trade.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon probably deserved a better fate. Counsell reached base
with one out and one on when his bouncer through the middle glanced
off Bohanon's bare left hand.
</P>
<P>
   The ball deflected to Baerga, who shoveled it with his glove to
shortstop Luis Lopez for the force at second base. But Lopez's
relay was not in time to double the speedy Counsell, and the Mets
still needed one more out.
</P>
<P>
   It never came. John Cangelosi, a pinch-hitter, followed with a
bloop single to center to move Counsell to third. And then the
left-handed hitting Dunwoody singled off the left-handed Bohanon,
as Counsell scampered home with the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Met offense had sputtered. This time, the
pitching and defense were not able to overcome it.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile had tied the score at 3-3 on a two-out single off
Turk Wendell in the eighth. That Marlins' rally spoiled an
impressive pitching performance by Dennis Cook, whose only hit
allowed in two and a third innings innings of relief _ a two-out
double to Mark Kotsay _ immediately preceded Zeile's single.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could have regained the lead, but they left Lopez
stranded at third with one out after he led off the ninth inning
with a double. Matt Franco, who replaced Bernard Gilkey in left
field after Gilkey was hit in the face with a pitch in the third
inning, nearly put the Mets back ahead. But his liner back to the
box was snared by Matt Mantei, who had to leap for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza followed by grounding out to short to end the inning
with the score still tied.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins had escaped in the ninth. The Mets did not.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets erased an early 2-0 deficit by piecing together three
third-inning runs on two hit batsmen, an error, two singles and a
sacrifice fly. And then, as usual, the pitching and defense took
over.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, a former Marlin, bailed out Masato Yoshii with two pitches
in the sixth inning after the Marlins had put runners on first and
third with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii had battled his way through five and one third innings
before he put himself in position for trouble by committing a
two-base error on Kotsay's grounder to first. When Zeile followed
with a single to left, Yoshii was gone, after allowing five hits
and two runs, walking one and striking out three.
</P>
<P>
   On came Cook, who was one of the most valuable performers on
Florida's run to the World Series title last fall. With the tying
run on third, his first pitch to Cliff Floyd resulted in a foul pop
to first. On the next pitch, pinch-hitter Derrek Lee grounded to
the shortstop side of second, where Rey Ordonez made a sensational
sliding stop and backhanded toss to Baerga at second for the force
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez's defensive gem followed ones by Wayne Kirby and Piazza
in the second (they teamed to throw out Gregg Zaun at the plate as
he attempted to score from third on a fly to right); Yoshii, who
snared a nasty right-back-at-you liner from Dunwoody leading off
the third; and Brian McRae, whose sliding catch in center field off
a sinking liner by Zaun prevented the Marlins from scoring the
tying run in the fourth. That came one batter after Ordonez had
made a pretty over-the-shoulder catch on Ryan Jackson in short
center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' three-run third inning began on the scariest moment of
the evening: The rookie right-hander Ryan Dempster hit Gilkey just
below the left eye with a 1-2 fastball. The ball appeared to have
glanced off Gilkey's helmet before hitting his face. After a few
moments, Gilkey _ whose first-inning single snapped an 0 for 25
spell _ arose and walked off the field. X-rays showed no break. All
that remained was a bruise on Gilkey's face.

Remlinger, Reds 
silence Astros 8-1
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CINCINNATI _ In 45 previous innings, the Cincinnati Reds had scored
six runs. On Friday night against the Astros, they got four in the
first inning.
</P>
<P>
   And what began with the possibility of an offensive explosion
fizzled as Cincinnati halted the Astros' five-game winning streak
with an 8-1 rout before a crowd of 21,310 at Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was clearly a game the Astros _ and starter Jose Lima _ would
like to forget. The lost not only to a Cincinnati club in last
place in the National League Central but to a pitcher who hadn't
won in more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   And Lima's fourth-inning exit was his earliest this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' victory was only their second in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger (4-7) snapped a personal four-game losing streak,
allowing two hits in a season-high eight innings of work. He
retired 13 straight batters from the fourth inning to the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy pitched a great game,'' manager Larry Dierker said.
``In a way, it's better that a guy is going to shut you down that
way. If you're going to have a game where you give up eight runs,
you might as well do it when the other guy is pitching a
two-hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger said, ``I was talking to (injured pitcher) Jose Rijo
during the last homestand and he told me to stop worrying about all
that other stuff. And he was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I walk a guy, I walk him, but I need to do it with
conviction and stop nibbling.''
</P>
<P>
   After a leadoff home run by Craig Biggio on the third pitch of
the game, the Astros couldn't muster any more offense. Moises
Alou's bloop single to right in the fourth inning was the last hit
the Astros got off Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell and Jeff Bagwell singled in the ninth off reliever
Danny Graves.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hit output was the lowest total for the Astros since
Chicago's Kerry Wood pitched a one-hitter in his 20-strikeout
masterpiece May 6.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger got off to an inauspicious start when Biggio hit a 1-1
pitch into the right-field bleachers, his second leadoff homer of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   But from then on, Remlinger held the National League's
best-hitting team in road games to one hit while striking out five.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he gave up a leadoff homer, you don't expect one hit the
rest of the night,'' said Bagwell. ``Obviously, one run in the
first inning is not enough. Down 5-1 in the third, with the offense
we have, it's definitely not out of reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima (7-3) suffered through his worst outing of the season,
allowing five runs and eight hits in 3 innings. Lima had pitched
six innings or more in all 13 of his starts until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who pitched a five-hit shutout against Kansas City in his
previous start, had trouble from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds hit just about everything Lima threw in the vicinity of
home plate during a four-run first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Greene, Barry Larkin, Eddie Taubensee and Dmitri Young
had consecutive singles, and Melvin Nieves delivered a two-run
single to give the Reds a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati had scored six runs total in its previous five games
_ all losses _ against Cleveland and San Diego. The eight runs were
the most by the Reds since they scored eight against Los Angeles on
May 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make any excuses. Tonight, I was bad,'' Lima
said. ``If you leave pitches up to anybody, you are going to pay
the price. Everything was up, and they rocked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better now than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Larkin, the center of trade rumors last few days, homered
off Lima in the fifth inning. Larkin went 2-for-4 with a sacrifice
fly in a three-run eighth off Bob Scanlan, whose throwing error
helped the rally along.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he thought about taking Lima out after six of the
first eight batters reached base.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lima stayed in until the score was 5-1. Trever Miller
retired one batter in relief, and C.J. Nitkowski shut out the Reds
for three innings before Scanlan finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to happen sooner or later that Lima had a bad night on
the mound,'' Dierker said. ``He never got anything going his way.
That's the way it is. Sometimes, it's merciful to take a pitcher
out. I think he wanted to stay. That's admirable, but I just don't
think there was any future of him staying in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who entered the game with an NL-leading .271 average
on the road, did not have a runner reach third base after Biggio's
home run. The Astros put runners at first and second in the fourth
inning when Alou singled and Sean Berry walked, but Remlinger got
Carl Everett to line out to left field.

NO MORE RELIEF FOR DREIFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It wasn't long ago that Darren Dreifort owned a
0-4 record as a starter, struggled in the middle innings and was
being questioned about whether he should be sent back to the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the former reliever could reach the .500 mark with a
victory over the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, Dreifort was 0-4 with a 4.61 ERA. But since then, the
right-hander has dropped his ERA 1.05 points and improved his
record to 4-5.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Goose Gregson isn't surprised by Dreifort's
turnaround. Gregson says the 26-year-old has progressively gotten
stronger as a starter, uses both sides of the plate more
effectively and is using his pitches better. Dreifort is also 4-1
with a 2.41 ERA in his past five starts since reuniting with
Charles Johnson, his catcher during the 1992 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt that (Dreifort) has the stuff to be a
workhorse starter,'' said Gregson. ``He is a big, strong guy with a
great work ethic and big, strong set of legs. This guy has the
potential to go out there every day and throw eight or nine
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are hard to find out there. I've always felt more
comfortable with him as a starter than a reliever.''
</P>
<P>
   While reaching .500 could be a great landmark for Dreifort, he
says he hasn't thought much about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more important that we win the ballgame,'' said
Dreifort. ``whether it's with me or with the bullpen. I'm not
really concerned about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros conference: After much ado about his recovery from his
knee injury, Eric Karros held a mini pregame press conference to
answer all the knee questions at once.
</P>
<P>
   The first baseman has kept a limp, described Advil as ``candy''
to him and has said his knee might never be the same and he should
have rehabbed longer. On Friday, he arrived at Dodger Stadium five
hours before the game to receive about two hours' worth of
treatment, but he says he is progressing. He also said he wasn't
planning on taking a stretch of games off, but he will rest when
his knee isn't cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much a difference it would make (if I
rested),'' said Karros, who missed the season's first 21 games
after having left-knee surgery. ``It's my choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc: Dodgers reliever Darren Hall will begin a 20-day
rehabilitation assignment today with Single-A San Bernardino at
Visalia. The right-hander, who will throw either one inning or no
more than 15 pitches, hasn't thrown since April 3 because of a
right rotator cuff tear.... Through six interleague games, the
Dodgers' 4-2 record ties them for second in the National League
with three other clubs and they are fourth in ERA at 2.72.... The
Wall Street Journal ranked Dodger Stadium as the third-worst
stadium in the majors for fans to catch a foul ball. The paper says
to ``milk the baselines'' for the best opportunities.

FORMER STATE SENATOR RE-ENTERS RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two weeks after he dropped out of the state Senate
race in the Bronx, Pedro Espada Jr. said Friday that he had changed
his mind and would run in the Democratic primary to regain the seat
he once held.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is certain to inject a new round of turbulence into
the political landscape in the Bronx. When he withdrew from the
race, Espada had said that it would help promote party unity while
also helping his son, Councilman Pedro Gautier Espada, mend his
relationship with Democratic Party officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Espada said he had reversed his decision because
Bronx Democratic officials had reneged on what he said were
promises to stop an investigation of his health-care business if he
pulled out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Espada said that the Bronx Democratic leader, Assemblyman
Roberto Ramirez, had indicated two weeks ago that he would ask
Robert Johnson, the Bronx district attorney, to end investigations
of Espada's finances at the Soundview Health Clinic if he did not
oppose the incumbent state senator, David Rosado.
</P>
<P>
   Espada and his son have had a volatile, on-again off-again
relationship with the Bronx Democratic organization for the last
two years. But it seemed that the two sides were mending fences
with Espada's decision not to seek his old seat.
</P>
<P>
   That decision was viewed as a victory for Ramirez, since it
would have reduced the number of Democratic officials facing
opponents in the party's primary in September. Instead, Ramirez and
the Democratic organization now seem destined for a highly charged
primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Espada said that his brother, Jose Espada, the owner of an
ambulance company, would now run for the Assembly against Ruben
Diaz Jr., who holds the seat once held by Pedro Gautier Espada, the
councilman. Also, Espada said, his son will oppose Rosado for the
position of Democratic leader in that district.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reported Friday that it had obtained audio and
video tapes from Espada of a secretly recorded meeting between
Espada and Rosado as well as a meeting between Rosado and his son,
the councilman, two weeks ago. In those tapes, the paper said,
Rosado boasted of the Democratic Party's ability to influence the
Bronx district attorney either to investigate or call off
investigations of Espada's business, based on the former senator's
political decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez denied that there was any truth to what Rosado was
saying, calling it the most ``ludicrous statement I would have
possibly heard.'' Asked if there had been any deal offered by the
organization to persuade Espada to stay out of the race, Ramirez
said: ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney,
declined to comment on what investigations, if any, his office was
conducting into Espada and his business. He added that, ``when
legal matters are under review in this office, political
considerations are not part of the decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rosado acknowledged that he had conversations with
the Espadas, but said that he sensed that he was being trapped and
had deliberately misled the two men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed that he was trying to corner me into something,''
Rosado said Friday. ``I knew he was a liar, so I lied to a liar.''

CAN AMERICANS TAKE NEXT STEP?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France _ Everything the United States has
accomplished on the soccer field the past four years the fine
second-round showing at the 1994 World Cup, that magical summer of
'95, the gutty finish to its '98 qualifying campaign, that
incredible triumph over Brazil just a few months ago means nothing
now.
</P>
<P>
   The strides this country has made in the world's sport, and the
deeds that have signaled its emergence as an international power of
sorts, will be put to the test the next couple weeks, and the
consensus is that the Americans haven't got a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission, to reach the knockout phase of the 16th World
Cup, appears well out of reach, so much so that American soccer's
top official admits he's not anticipating a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to make the second round,'' says Alan Rothenberg,
U.S. Soccer's president. ``Realistically, I don't expect to achieve
that goal. Realistically, I think we will fall a little short of
that goal and not make it out of the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest obstacles to meeting the goal are pretty huge,
indeed: reigning European champion Germany, three-time World Cup
champs and participants in five of the last seven title games, and
Yugoslavia, which by all accounts has far more talent than the
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams will escape the four-team Group F --- four
third-place teams, the United States among them, reached the second
round in '94 --- which means the Americans must overcome the
Germans (Monday in Paris) or the Yugoslavs (June 25 in Nantes),
along with Iran (June 21 in Lyon), if they are to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Mission impossible?
</P>
<P>
   ``The task of getting to the second round is much more difficult
than in '94,'' acknowledges Coach Steve Sampson. ``The second round
would be a wonderful accomplishment. But equally important is how
we play, to continue to show we're playing a much more
sophisticated style of soccer, more intelligent, more calculated,
with more taking of risks. Then we will have grown as a
soccer-playing nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, especially in the time since Sampson
stepped in after Bora Milutinovic's dismissal in April 1995, the
Yanks have exhibited impressive growth, evolving from a
pseudoprofessional outfit that worked hard to confound its superior
foes to a capable, confident squad that seeks to impose its game,
an attacking style geared toward winning rather than avoided
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In previous World Cups,'' Sampson says, ``we weren't on even
playing ground with our opponents. ... This team, given their
experience now, truly believes in themselves and believes that they
can beat Germany, Iran and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a very special effort to do well in this World Cup,
but I don't believe we've ever been better prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   The key, it appears, is a 3-6-1 alignment (three defenders, six
midfielders and one forward) geared toward providing playmaking
midfielder Claudio Reyna all the tools he needs to make the U.S.
attack go. Utilizing the Americans' depth in midfield and speed on
the flanks, the new formation is designed to clog up the middle of
the field, turn the defense from a liability to a strength, and
create a counterattack that causes problems for opponents.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so-so: The Yanks, with world-class goalkeeper Kasey
Keller in the nets, have shut out its last four foes but have had
trouble scoring goals. The return of striker Eric Wynalda from knee
surgery could answer many of the doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Also crucial are wingers Cobi Jones and Frankie Hejduk, if he is
sufficiently recovered from a hamstring ailment, who are capable of
causing chaos in opposing defenses. Defensive midfielders Chad
Deering and Brian Maisonneuve, both capable playmakers as well,
provide a foundation for the whole thing to work.
</P>
<P>
   That the United States hasn't tested the alignment against any
significant opposition since the 3-0 thrashing April 22 of fellow
World Cup finalist Austria is a bit worrisome. But Sampson, and his
players, aren't among those worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic,'' says defender Alexi Lalas, who along
with fellow '94 star Marcelo Balboa has moved to the bench in favor
of a swifter sweeper-and-markers defense of Thomas Dooley, Eddie
Pope and naturalized Frenchman David Regis. ``I think this is the
best American team ever. (We have) more experience, more leaders,
more character, more personality ...''
</P>
<P>
   Says Sampson: ``No one expects the United States to get out of
the first round. All the pressure is on Germany and Yugoslavia. We
have our own expectations, and our own expectations --- regardless
of what anybody else says --- is that we expect to get out of the
first round. ... We have a chance to do something special.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also have the chance of doing something special
... and still not reaching the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to do the best we can,'' says midfielder Tab
Ramos, one of three veterans --- with Wynalda and Balboa --- of the
1990 and 1994 World Cups. ``We have to play our best game, and if
that's not good enough, if it's beyond our reach, then there's
nothing we could've done anyway. But we'll be disappointed if we
don't do the best we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Germany comes in and doesn't play its best game, but we
play our best game, I think we can beat them. And same with
Yugoslavia. But if they play their best game and we also play our
best game, it'll be hard. They have a better team than we do, and
so does Yugoslavia. There's nothing we can do about that.''

   LOS ANGELES -- Richard Hirsch and John Paul Beltran think
they've hit on a winning management philosophy for their women's
apparel manufacturing company: Create an enjoyable, relatively
low-stress environment and everyone will work in peak form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times when you talk about something like this it sounds
like a bunch of baloney, but it works,'' said Beltran, 44, co-owner
of John Paul Richard Inc. ``People do better when they're having a

million in sales last year and has operated in the black since
January 1997, about six months after its birth, according to
Hirsch, 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very much on track in 1998 to do $80 million (in
sales),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The women's sportswear maker's success was just affirmed in
another way. It topped the list of the country's 100
fastest-growing small businesses in the June issue of Entrepreneur
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, done in conjunction with Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, focused
on companies founded no earlier than 1995, with sales exceeding $1
million in 1997 and meeting the Small Business Administration's
definition of a small business, said Maria Anton, senior managing
editor for the Irvine-based business magazine.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul Richard Inc. outranked a host of high-tech and biotech
firms, which typically head the list, Anton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it's an apparel manufacturer -- that's a very
entrepreneurial, accessible business,'' she said. ``This company
was able to make a high ranking, where normally you see only tech
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we were very excited about that,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch and Beltran have a long history in the clothing business
and as working partners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 Hirsch had founded Melrose, a women's clothing
manufacturer that he sold in 1986 to St. Louis-based Kellwood Co.
He stayed on as an employee and, together with Beltran -- who had
joined Melrose in 1984 -- ran the company until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we decided that we had had enough of the big business,
corporate life, and the entrepreneurial style sounded very
appetizing to us,'' Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   The pair left Melrose and started John Paul Richard Inc. with
about $1.5 million in cash and a $1 million loan.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the company relied on contacts and
relationships with the domestic and overseas contractors, fabric
suppliers, sweater knitters and others with whom Hirsch and Beltran
had worked in prior years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a good policy never to burn bridges,'' Hirsch
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's clothing is sold at big department stores like
Macy's, J.C. Penney, Sears and Mervyns and at specialty stores
throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Something else that keeps workers happy: Six key managers own a
percentage in the company as equity partners, something that Hirsch
said doesn't happen often enough in a large corporate structure.
Many had worked at Melrose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel they are in fact owners of the company, and they
treat the company as if it were their own,'' he said, adding that
he and Beltran are the company's majority owners.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't the important thing for design director Marilyn
Fralin, one of those equity partners.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's the working environment that she values. Hirsch
and Beltran know what to expect from her and she knows what they
expect, which she said gives her the creative freedom she needs to
do her job.
</P>
<P>
   Also, she knows many John Paul Richard employees from Melrose,
where she had worked for 12 years, until about 1995. And John Paul
Richard being a smaller company, there isn't the backstabbing,
cutthroat politics that can make life in a big corporation so
unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a comfort level -- everybody gets along,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has plans to expand soon and will probably have to
move to a larger facility. The pair say their company's roots are
planted firmly in the Valley area.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Beltran lives in Encino, Hirsch lives in Agoura Hills,
and most of the company's 70 employees live in the Valley -- which
Beltran said is a whole lot better place to have a business than
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're big believers in the Valley,'' he said. ``We've always
been here.''

VICE PRINCIPAL SENTENCED IN GAMBLING OPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The vice principal of a Brooklyn middle school who
amassed $2.5 million from a network of illegal Joker Poker gambling
machines in poor neighborhoods that he obsessively tended for 10
years was sentenced in federal court Friday to 15 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Metzger, a guidance counselor and vice principal of
Intermediate School 218 in East New York, concealed his wealth from
his wife, hiding thousands of dollars in small bills and coins in a
one-room apartment that he rented in Queens, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Metzger, a school board employee of 33 years, pleaded guilty to
operating and hiding the profits of an illegal gambling business
two years ago. When investigators burst into his Kew Gardens
apartment to arrest him, they found him alone at the kitchen table,
rolling quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Denis Hurley of U.S. District Court did not fine Metzger,
who has forfeited all his gambling profits. But his school board
pension will be garnished to pay $500,000 in federal taxes on the
$2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the whole 10-year period, he didn't spend any money,'' said
Richard Weber, an assistant U.S. prosecutor. On the day they
arrested Metzger, investigators found $18,000 in a bureau drawer,
including $5,000 in dollar bills and piles of loose quarters. One
safe deposit box contained $550,000. But the apartment was ``almost
bare,'' Weber said. ``A little wooden bed, a TV, and money
magazines: Money, Mutual Fund magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holbrook, N.Y., home where Metzger lived with his wife,
Judith, also a school board employee, and raised their son and
daughter was a ``typical middle-income house, mortgaged up, with
him driving a Saturn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, Metzger, 55, owned as many as 50 slot machines, all
in poor neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx and
accessible to teen-agers, Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors and IRS investigators discovered the slot
machines after police officers complained that residents with
little money were gambling away their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other people convicted of operating illegal slot machines
are scheduled for sentencing soon.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Lotto, Metzger's lawyer, said his client, whose salary as
a vice principal was more than $60,000, was obsessively afraid of
growing old in poverty. Maintaining the gambling machines was
exhausting, dangerous work that Metzger did alone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to go several times a week to empty them,'' Lotto said.
``He would drive all over Brooklyn and the Bronx. He'd go to
collect money in these bodegas in the middle of the night. He was
afraid he'd get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber said Metzger deposited $900,000 in Swiss bank accounts and
about $750,000 in accounts in the names of relatives, and had cash
in several safe deposit boxes.

COMPUTER TESTER NETCOM FILES FOR PUBLIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Netcom Systems Inc., which makes equipment to
test computer networks, said Friday that it plans to go public.
</P>
<P>
   In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the company said it plans to sell 20 percent of the company -- or
about 12.4 million common shares -- in a $148.8 million initial
public offering. At an expected sell price of between $11 and $13,
the shares would give Netcom an implied market capitalization of
more than $730 million.
</P>
<P>
   Netcom makes a system called SmartBits that tests the speed at
which the routers, switches and processors that make up a computer
network swap information. Network equipment manufacturers use the
system to ensure their products function properly and at maximum
efficiency. In its SEC filing, Netcom said its customers include
telecommunications companies, Internet service providers, financial
institutions and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Netcom had 1997 net income of $22.8 million on revenues of $56.3
million, up from earnings of $11.8 million on $27.5 million in
sales the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's future growth is dependent on sales to end users
and service providers,'' the filing said in a section detailing
risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   Netcom said it will use proceeds of the IPO to repay debt and
redeem existing shares, and to fund expanded sales, marketing and
the hiring of additional personnel. The company hopes its shares
will trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the NTCM
symbol.!dlim!!end!

SURPLUS IN STARTING ROTATION FORCES MENDOZA TO BULLPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rain washed out the scheduled game between the New
York Yankees and the Cleveland Indians Friday night at Yankee
Stadium, but it could not mute the machinations of a team trying
not to lose a step in its march to become the biggest winner in
baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who did not immediately reschedule the game, have
the major leagues' best record at 46-14. But they are being forced
to tinker with rotations and lineups, the latter because of
injuries to Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams, the former because of
a glut of successful starters.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre took care of one of those problems Friday by
shifting Ramiro Mendoza from the starting rotation to the bullpen
after learning that Andy Pettitte, who left Thursday night's game
in Montreal with an apparent injury, will not miss a turn.
</P>
<P>
   Torre told Mendoza, Friday night's scheduled starter, that he
would not only lose the turn but would also have to relinquish his
position in the rotation until further notice. That decision came
in the wake of two sizzling outings by Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban
defector who won his first two major-league starts while filling in
for the injured David Cone and David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wells has recovered from a twinge in his left shoulder. Cone
has put a dog bite on his pitching hand behind him and will start
against the Indians today. And Pettitte is also fine, one day after
the left-hander was removed because of a sore buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   With six healthy starters, Torre was left with a decision about
how to reduce the number to five. It was not a tough choice, even
though Torre is a huge fan of Mendoza, who is 4-1 with a 4.00
earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, conceded Torre, ``is tough to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mendoza hasn't done anything wrong,'' Torre said, but he added
that the ease with which Hernandez ``pitched the other day was
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza was informed of the change of role before the Yankees
officially postponed Friday night's game. He left the clubhouse
before Torre informed reporters and was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he had emphasized to Mendoza his continued importance
to the team, primarily in innings such as the sixth and seventh,
where other relievers have struggled of late. Mendoza's sinker and
ability to coax ground-ball outs and double plays made him
successful in such a role at times last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What works against him is he has done it before,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   So the manager tried to couch the news in terms of its not being
a demotion. But, Torre admitted, ``at first blush, he's not buying
this; he buys it, but it's disappointing to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the decision had to be made, if only to settle one of the
team's few problems, Torre said. The other one _ the lineup _
remained unresolved, however. Jeter, the Yankees' shortstop and No.
2 hitter, is suffering from a strained abdominal muscle and is not
scheduled to come off the disabled list until next Sunday.
Williams, the center fielder and cleanup hitter, sprained his right
knee on Wednesday night and is out at least two more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now my challenge is trying to figure out a lineup,''
Torre said. ``It's so easy when you have Bernie in there. Now, it's
trying to find the combination I'll be comfortable with. But as far
as the challenge, it's still the pitching. If we pitch, I think we
have enough ways we can score runs to be able to offset our
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee, who signed with the Yankees as a 16-year-old in
1990, finally got his first call to the major leagues on Thursday
when he was informed by his manager at Class AAA Columbus, Stump
Merrill, that he would take Bernie Williams' roster spot. ``He
called me in and told me I was scratched from the lineup _ `you're
going to the big club,' he said,'' said Ledee, his eyes welling as
he spoke Friday. ``I couldn't talk, I couldn't say anything. I
started to shake, I was so nervous.'' ... Andy Pettitte, who felt a
twinge in the buttocks while running out a sacrifice bunt on
Thursday in Montreal, was checked Friday by the team physician,
Stuart Hershon, ``for about 10 seconds, and I'm fine,'' the pitcher
said. ... Williams, though concerned about suffering his first knee
injury during an awkward slide into third base, was also relieved.
``Whenever you hear it's going to be two weeks, that's better than
surgery,'' the center fielder said. ``It's still sensitive to the
touch, but I can walk on it, which is good.''
