Hostages Said To Be in Philippines
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ISABELA, Philippines (AP) -- A Philippine rebel commander is suspected of
kidnapping of 21 people at Malaysian diving resort and is holding them on
islands at the Philippines' southern tip, officials said Wednesday. ''They are
here,'' Sulu provincial Governor Abdusakur Tan said, adding that they are
probably being held by Galid Andang, the commander of Muslim Abu Sayyaf rebels
in the province. Tan told The Associated Press he would meet later Wednesday
with military officials, including Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, to discuss
whether to negotiate for the hostages' release.

Cheney To Head Bush's VP Selection
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Tapping a prominent figure from his father's
administration, George W. Bush selected former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on
Tuesday to head his vice presidential selection team. ''I trust Dick Cheney's
judgment; I know his character,'' Bush said. ''It's obviously an important
decision for me and I can't think of a better person to work with on making that
decision.'' Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said he
hasn't made any list of potential prospects and Cheney's service as chairman
would not disqualify him from being selected himself.

Elian Strike Closes Little Havana
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Workers stayed home, students skipped school and businesses
closed Tuesday as Cuban-Americans called a general strike that shut down Little
Havana over the Elian Gonzalez case but barely slowed the rest of the city. The
protest brought honking cars and Cuban flags to the same streets where fires and
violence broke out Saturday after armed federal agents grabbed the 6-year-old
Cuban refugee in a pre-dawn raid to reunite him with his father.

Sen. McCain Returns to Vietnam

   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Shaking hands with crowds of Vietnamese, a nostalgic
John McCain returned Tuesday to the Hanoi lake where in 1967 he was dragged
ashore and beaten after parachuting from his downed warplane. The bitter war has
yielded to reconciliation, and the Arizona senator strolled with his family
around the busy shorefront of the capital's Truc Bach lake, stopping at a
sidewalk memorial marking his rescue. ''I put the Vietnam War behind me a long
time ago,'' McCain said upon arriving in Vietnam today. ''I harbor no anger, no
rancor.''

Mexico Candidates Hold First Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- With Mexico's presidential election turning into a real
race, opposition candidates attacked the ruling party's nominee in a televised
debate tonight and pleaded with Mexicans to reject the party that has ruled
Mexico for 71 years. ''In fewer than 70 days, we'll have the historic, unique
opportunity to end more than 70 years of bad governments, to change more than 70
years of a corrupt system that has stolen from Mexicans the fruits of their
labor,'' said Vicente Fox of the center-right National Action Party.

Arrest Made in National Zoo Shooting
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An arrest has been made in the shooting at the National
Zoo that wounded seven youths and stunned visitors to one of the capital's most
popular tourist attractions. A 16-year-old boy was taken into custody at the
home of a relative in northeast Washington 24 hours after the shooting,
Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer said. Seven children between the ages of
11 and 16 were shot Monday following a fight at the zoo. A high-ranking police
official had said that doctors told him the most severely wounded, an
11-year-old boy, was brain dead. But Children's National Medical Center said the
child was never brain dead, his condition has improved and he was responding to
care.

<HEADLINE> Royals 7, Devil Rays 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Albie Lopez threw wildly to second on a
grounder to the mound in the bottom of the ninth inning, allowing
the Kansas City Royals to snap a nine-game losing streak with a 7-6
victory over Tampa Bay on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and one out in a 6-6 game, Mark
Quinn hit a slow roller that could have resulted in a double play.
But Lopez (1-1) threw the ball low and second baseman Miguel Cairo
couldn't handle it, allowing Carlos Beltran to score the winning
run.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth straight victory at home for the Royals, all in
their final at-bat. But they followed the first four of those
victories with the nine-game losing streak on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals led 6-5 heading into the ninth inning, but Greg
Vaughn's home run off Dan Reichert (1-0) tied the score. That was
the only hit he allowed in 3 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon's sacrifice fly scored pinch runner Luis Ordaz in
the bottom of the eighth gave the Royals the 6-5 lead, breaking a
streak of 88 innings that the Royals had not led at the end of an
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay jumped to a 2-0 lead in the first on an RBI double by
Fred McGriff and an RBI single by John Flaherty. The Royals
answered with a run in the bottom of the first on Jermaine Dye's
double, the first of his four hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays then opened a 5-1 lead in the third on a
bases-loaded walk to Bubba Trammell and a two-run single by Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Dye hit his ninth homer of the season for the Royals in the
third after Mike Sweeney led off the inning with an infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Randa tied it 5-5 in the bottom of the fourth with a two-run
homer after Dye's double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Chris Fussell made his first start of the season for Kansas
City. ... Dye's home run tied the club record for home runs in the
month of April. The record was set by Dean Palmer in 1998. He went
4-for-5 with a home run, two doubles, three RBI and nine total
bases. It was the fourth time in his career that he had four hits
in a game. ... Vaughn's home run in the top of the ninth was the
36th allowed by the Royals this season, tops in the major leagues.
... The Royals' nine-game losing streak was tied for the
fourth-longest streak in club history. The longest streak in team
in history is 12 games in 1997. ... During their just-completed
road trip, the Royals never held a lead at the end of an inning.
Seven times they took a lead in the top of an inning, only to see
the opposition come back to tie or take the lead in the bottom of
the inning. ... The Devil Rays won eight of 10 games against the
Royals last season. ... The Devils Rays are starting a six-game
road trip. They will travel to Anaheim for four games following the
two-game set against Kansas City. ... This is the first of an
11-game homestand for Kansas City, the longest of the season.

<HEADLINE> Calif., NY, Texas Are Top Spenders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- California, New York and Texas are tops when
it comes to taking in and spending money.
</P>
<P>
   According to new figures being released Wednesday by the Census
Bureau, California took in nearly $145 billion in revenue in 1998
while New York was second with $96 billion. The next closest was
Texas with nearly $58 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The states, which are also the top three in population, led the
country in expenditures as well: California with $120 billion, New
York with $87 billion, and Texas with $51 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The data is part of the Census Bureau's 1998 Annual Survey of
Government Finances.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for all 50 state governments totaled $1.1 trillion,
while expenditures totaled $930 billion. Nearly $295 billion, or 32
percent, of the expenditure total went to education, and $208
billion went to public welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the top five states with the highest expenditures, New York
spent the smallest chunk (20 percent) on education while Texas
spent the most (38 percent of its 51 billion in expenditures).
</P>
<P>
   ''Is this adequate investment? Well, we're in a new century,''
said Isabel Garcia of the National Education Association. ''In
terms of school modernization we have tremendous needs across the
nation and we have to look at the needs from state to state.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska led the country with both highest revenue per capita
($14,722) and highest expenditures per capita ($9,451). Texas was
last in both categories ($2,926 per capita in revenue and $2,584
per capita in expenditures).

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo market's main index fell on profit-taking
Wednesday morning. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 126.37 points,
or 0.69 percent, to 18,145.96 at the end of the morning session. On
Tuesday, the average closed down 207.82 points, or 1.12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.72 yen in late morning, up 0.36 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo, but below its late New York level of 105.81
yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices started higher led by major
information technology blue chips after the Nasdaq composite index
rose 228.75 to 3,711.23 at Tuesday's finish.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nikkei index moved into negative territory as investors
sold in some of the 30 stocks that were added to the index Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Those new issues, which include telecommunications companies,
replaced 30 mostly old-line industrial stocks to better reflect
changes in Japan's economy. Most of the new issues had been bid up
in anticipation of the move.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 4.26 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,669.54. The
TOPIX closed up 4.26 points, or 0.27 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Also in New York on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average
rose 218.72 points to close at 11,124.82.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar basically followed its trend in
New York, where the greenback strengthened amid higher U.S. stocks
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the dollar's relative strength against the euro
also led to its firmness against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has come under pressure in recent weeks amid questions
over how European authorities will defend the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was traded at 97.30 yen, down from 98.65 yen late
Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7350 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.7400 percent. Its
price fell 0.82 point to 100.55.

<HEADLINE> Medical Bills Play Bankruptcy Role  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The elderly may have huge medical debts
because of declining health or the medical bills of a failing or
deceased spouse.
</P>
<P>
   For younger Americans, the bills may pile up because of child
health expenses. Either way, a new study says disastrous medical
bills play a significant role in personal bankruptcies, accounting
for about 40 percent of the filings last year.
</P>
<P>
   About 500,000 Americans filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999
at least in part because of heavy medical expenses, according to
the study to be published next month in a specialized journal.
</P>
<P>
   The financial misfortune can befall people with health insurance
as well as the uninsured because some insurance policies are
inadequate, the survey of bankruptcy filings showed.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that seniors and women, as well as families
headed by single women, were the groups in bankruptcy that were
hardest hit by medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   One of its authors, Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren, says
that paints a very different picture from the image offered by
credit card companies of out-of-control spenders trying to game the
legal system through bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Very little attention has been paid to the number of people
who are in bankruptcy because of serious medical problems,'' Warren
said Tuesday in a telephone interview from Boston. ''It's a
reminder that many of the families in bankruptcy have been pressed
to the edge'' by expenses stemming from illness or injury.
</P>
<P>
   The study was first reported in Tuesday's Washington Post. It
comes as legislation making it harder for people to sweep away
credit card and other debts through bankruptcy is before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bills previously passed by the House and Senate, with veto-proof
margins, apply new standards for determining whether people filing
for bankruptcy should be forced to repay their debts under a
court-approved reorganization plan rather than having them
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators must meld the two bills into one
measure to be approved by both chambers and sent to President
Clinton. The two versions are fairly similar but negotiations
appear to have stalled over whether to remove from the Senate bill
provisions that would raise the $5.15 hourly minimum wage to $6.15
over three years and, in return, give billions in new tax breaks to
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The new study on medical bills and bankruptcy ''absolutely will
become a factor in the debate'' over the legislation, said Frank
Torres, legislative counsel for Consumers Union. ''Now it's up to
Congress whether or not they'll pay attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy legislation has been pushed for several years by
the banking industry and credit card companies, which have spent
millions of dollars lobbying for it.
</P>
<P>
   William Binzel, a spokesman for MasterCard International, didn't
dispute the findings of the study by Warren; Teresa Sullivan, dean
of graduate studies at the University of Texas; and Melissa Jacoby,
an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ''There really isn't anything new in the study,'' Binzel said,
noting that people often seek the shelter of bankruptcy court as
the result of an ''economic upheaval.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he maintained, that does not diminish the need for
legislation making it tougher for those who can afford to repay
their debts -- including medical bills as well as credit card
balances -- to dissolve them through bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They should be required to do so,'' Binzel said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to catastrophic illness or injury, experts also have
cited job loss or divorce as frequent causes of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The new study examined bankruptcy filings in 1999 in eight
federal judicial districts in California, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Personal bankruptcies in this country reached a record 1.4
million in 1998, despite the strong economy, up more than 300
percent since 1980. The rate declined last year, though, as an
estimated 112,000 fewer people received bankruptcy court protection
than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer advocates have attributed the decline largely to
consumers speeding up repayment of their credit card debts.

<HEADLINE> Sharks 3, Blues 1  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- All the St. Louis Blues have for their
114-point regular-season championship is a worthless trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Shields rebounded from a shaky Game 6 with 21 saves as the
San Jose Sharks tightened up on defense to eliminate the Blues in
the first round of their Western Conference series with a 3-1
victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues, who seemingly seized control with a 6-2 Game 6
victory on the road, landed with a thud in the seventh game in
their quest to become the 16th team in NHL history to rally from a
3-1 series deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Presidents' Trophy winners became only the second NHL
regular-season champion to get knocked out in the first round,
joining the 1991 Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Presidents' Cup was established in the 1985-86 season,
only four of the 15 winners have gone on to win the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Stern, Owen Nolan and Jeff Friesen scored for the Sharks,
who finished 27 points behind the Blues. This is their third major
first-round upset in the nine-year franchise history, joining
triumphs over No. 1 conference seed Detroit in 1994 and No. 2
Calgary in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks will face the Pacific Division champion Dallas Stars
in the second round beginning Friday night at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Young, who had a hat trick in Game 6, scored his sixth
goal of the playoffs on a third-period power play for St. Louis.
But Blues stars Al MacInnis and Pierre Turgeon were quiet, and
captain Chris Pronger was on the ice for the Sharks' first two
goals.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 14th first-round playoff exit for the Blues, who
got off only six shots in the first period and five in the second
to disappoint a sellout crowd of 20,418 -- largest of the season.
The Blues haven't made it out of the second round since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Stern gave the Sharks the lead on the game's second shot with
his first goal, and point, of the playoffs. Goalie Roman Turek was
slow to recover and out of position when Stern took the puck off
the glass behind the net and slipped in a backhand shot at 2:51.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks' second goal of the first period was a shocker as
Nolan scored his fifth on a drive from well outside the blue line
with 10.2 seconds to go. The shot deflected off Turek's glove.
</P>
<P>
   A miscue by defenseman Marc Bergevin helped the Sharks make it
3-0. Bergevin tried to catch a puck but bobbled it as Friesen and
Tomas Sundstrom converged on him, creating a 2-on-none break.
Friesen misfired on his first attempt but slapped it home after the
puck got tangled in legs near the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues narrowed the gap to two goals when Young scored. He
scored at 2:09, seconds after Pronger hit the goal post and the
goal light went on prematurely, and some of the Sharks appeared to
relax. The goal was allowed after a short consultation.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis missed a chance to make it closer after Stephane
Matteau got a double minor for high-sticking against Ladislav Nagy
at 2:12. Al MacInnis blunted the power play when he was called for
holding at 3:33.

<HEADLINE> GE Retirees Rally on Eve of Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By HANK KURZ Jr., Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Retired General Electric employees who
claim they're forced to live on meager pensions while the company
sits on a $24 billion pension fund surplus plan to take their case
to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We drove 9{ hours to be here and we drove 9{ hours to be
heard,'' said John Lockett, 64, of Syracuse, N.Y. ''We're not going
home until we are heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The retirees plan to hand out fliers outside today's
shareholders meeting here, while those with stock hope to get a
chance to make their case for larger cost-of-living increases
inside.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the second time in two days angry workers have gone
to shareholders to try to bend management of their company's
pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, IBM workers got more support than they expected, but
fell short in a bid to make the company offer its traditional
pension plan to all workers. The computer maker converted thousands
of workers' pensions to a cash-balance plan, which critics say
hurts loyal employees who spend their entire careers at one
company. IBM employees who are at least 40 years old with at least
10 years' service are given a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking early retirement seven years ago when his job was
made obsolete, Lockett said, he has received about $50 in pension
increases. He said most GE pensions average between $700 and $800
per month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not beggars,'' Lockett, a machine repairman who served
37 years at GE, said at a rally Tuesday. ''We don't want handouts.
... What we want is a little respect.''
</P>
<P>
   A GE spokesman said the company has given retirees six pension
increases in 20 years, which he said was more than most of its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our pensions are very competitive with other companies,''
spokesman Gary Sheffer said. ''That's one of the reasons people
like to come to work for GE.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karen Friedman, a spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based
Pension Rights Center, said GE uses its pension surplus to
artificially boost earnings, while some retiree pensions are lower
than $400 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say to GE, 'You have a moral obligation to your
shareholders and your workers and retirees not just to do the
minimum or what you can get away with, but to do what's right. GE
should be a light onto corporate America, a leader,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman came to Richmond from Cleveland, Ohio, where she helped
IBM workers with their pension case.

<HEADLINE> Cheney To Head Bush's VP Selection  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Tapping a prominent figure from his father's
administration, George W. Bush selected former Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney on Tuesday to head his vice presidential selection
team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I trust Dick Cheney's judgment; I know his character,'' Bush
said. ''It's obviously an important decision for me and I can't
think of a better person to work with on making that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said he
hasn't made any list of potential prospects and Cheney's service as
chairman would not disqualify him from being selected himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''No lists yet, but it is the beginning of the list,'' the Texas
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the main qualification for his running mate would be
''somebody who can be president of the United States.'' In the
past, he has also said he wants his vice president to share his
government philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he might be leaning toward a woman or perhaps a
Washington outsider, the governor replied: ''They're all equally
important as I stand here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney suggested he would cast a wide net.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fortunately, there are many good candidates to chose from in
our party,'' Cheney said in a statement. ''We will look at them
all. And we will make sure we have the best ticket possible this
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush was spending the day in Washington. The
governor, whose foreign policy credentials have been questioned by
critics, is scheduled to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov, in town to see President Clinton and other U.S. officials.
The governor also was raising a record $18 million for the
Republican Party at a dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush leads Gore by 9 points, 52 percent to 41 percent
in a new Ohio Poll being released Wednesday. Ohio is closely
watched by candidates and political analysts because the state
almost always goes for the national winner in November. The
telephone poll of 521 likely voters by the University of Cincinnati
was taken April 5 through Saturday and has an error margin of plus
or minus 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in Cheney to steer the search will give the campaign a
dose of Washington and national political experience. After Bush
lost the New Hampshire and Michigan primaries, some Republican
officials questioned whether his Texas-based campaign team had the
experience necessary for a general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush ''doesn't want to make the 2000 election a referendum
on his dad, you need graybeards, people who have a cachet of
experience and savvy,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, a Washington
political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, is chief executive officer of Halliburton Co., a
Dallas-based engineering and construction company.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Bush's alma mater, Yale University, for two years
before transferring to the University of Wyoming. In 1974, he
became President Ford's chief of staff. In 1978, he was elected to
Congress from Wyoming. He was re-elected five times and rose to the
rank of minority whip -- the No. 2 Republican official.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, President Bush selected Cheney to be his defense
secretary, a position he held during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a running mate for Bush's Democratic rival, Vice
President Al Gore, is headed by Warren Christopher, who helped
President Clinton choose his first Cabinet and then served as
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation on Bush's running mate has focused on a number of
Republican governors and his former GOP rival John McCain. Other
possibilities include another former rival, Elizabeth Dole, and
Colin Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in his
father's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Will the former president have a role in the decision?
</P>
<P>
   ''He will not be a part of the formal process, but he does not
need to be,'' Bush said. ''He's my dad, I talk to him all the time.
He's got a few suggestions to make on occasion on different
subjects, and sometimes I listen to him and sometimes I don't.''

<HEADLINE> Down in the count: 100,000 or bust for Albany  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- This city will not go down for the count
without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   There are hopes that census workers canvassing door-to-door will
tally enough residents to help keep the city above the 100,000
population mark -- a threshold with financial as well as
psychological significance.
</P>
<P>
   Albany's population is 100,031 based on the 1990 count by the
U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, the agency estimates that the state capital's
population dropped to 94,305 by 1998. While city officials are
skeptical about the estimated loss of almost 6,000 souls, they have
taken steps to preserve their six-digit population count in the
current census.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're concerned, of course, about that 100,000 mark,'' said
Denise Kelley, Albany's registrar of vital statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The concern stems from more than just bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   There have been estimates that more than $1 million in federal
funding could be at stake over Albany's census count. And Kelley
said a dip below 100,000 could cost Albany the attention of private
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say,'OK, let's target cities over 100,000' ... It's a
benchmark that you don't want to be knocked out of the running
for,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   For months, city officials have been working to make sure
residents return mailed census forms. Exhortations to fill out the
forms came from church pulpits and at a special dinner for homeless
people. City schools held a census poster contest.
</P>
<P>
   But only 56 percent of Albany residents mailed in their census
forms. That's below the statewide rate of return of 61 percent,
although it is on par with the return rate for other upstate
cities.
</P>
<P>
   With census workers preparing to call on non-responding
households around the nation this week, Albany sees one last
opportunity to promote census compliance. A public service
announcement is being prepared by the city asking residents to
cooperate with census takers who knock on their doors.
</P>
<P>
   The census workers could be in the field through July, although
population tallies won't be known until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Cities across upstate New York lost population from 1990 through
1998, according to census figures. Buffalo lost an estimated 27,458
people, or 8.4 of its population. Syracuse saw a 7.1 percent drop,
and Rochester declined by 5.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Environmental groups ask New York to assess mercury risks  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state should be warning pregnant women
and nursing mothers not to eat seafood, since the federal
government is not properly protecting them from mercury-tainted
fish, environmental groups say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pregnant women, nursing mothers and people who consume high
levels of fish are not being adequately warned,'' said Laura
Haight, a spokeswoman for the New York Public Interest Research
Group.
</P>
<P>
   NYPIRG joined with the Sierra Club and Environmental Advocates
in calling for the warnings, which coincided with the release of a
new report criticizing the Food and Drug Administration for no
longer testing mercury levels in tuna, swordfish and shark.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Tuesday by the Vermont-based Mercury Policy
Project, the California Communities Against Toxics, the Sierra Club
and others says what little data exists shows all three of those
heavily consumer species often contain unsafe levels of mercury.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a potential health threat out there the public has
not been warned about,'' said John Stouffer, legislative director
of the Sierra Club's Atlantic chapter. ''The state Health
Department should warn pregnant women, women planning to become
pregnant and nursing mothers to restrict their consumption of
swordfish, shark and tuna.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercury is a metallic chemical element that also is a byproduct
of coal-fired power plants and trash incinerators. The New York
groups say about 33 percent of New York's mercury output was
generated by coal-burning plants that produced 98,000 pounds of the
element last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury can cause neurological damage if it is ingested. Fetuses
and young children are particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont, New Jersey, Minnesota and Michigan have warnings
advising pregnant women and nursing mothers to limit consumption of
the potentially-dangerous seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Pospisil, a spokeswoman for the Health Department, said
her agency would not issue those warnings, though it does warn
anglers against eating fish from some lakes and rivers because of
possible mercury contamination.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Health Department last year extended a warning
against eating more than one meal per month of smallmouth bass from
New York City's Ashokan Reservoir due to elevated levels of mercury
found in fish samples. Similar warnings had earlier been posted by
the Health Department for smallmouth bass taken from the Rondout
and Neversink reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation also said it
would not be appropriate for that agency to issue warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a federal issue,'' said spokeswoman Jennifer Post.
''The FDA sets (acceptable pollutant) levels and is responsible for
monitoring them. The DEC works with the Health Department to make
sure the fish people eat are safe based on federal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said they can prove the food supply is safe based
on historical data. Since mercury levels have not changed over the
past few years, there is no reason to test fish, they say.

<HEADLINE> State agency covers mural some workers call offensive  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state Education Department is covering
up a historic mural to be sensitive to its employees, but at least
one state lawmaker says the move amounts to censorship.
</P>
<P>
   The department covered the 29{-foot-by-18 foot mural, which
dates to the 1870s, after about 20 of its approximately 3,000
workers complained it unfairly portrays blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The mural includes numerous images from American history, such
as immigrants landing on American soil and Civil War battles coming
to an end. It also contains images of the dead rising from their
graves to celebrate America and a godlike statue of George
Washington encircled by angels. A corner of the mural shows a
scantily-clad black man being lifted up by a white man, apparently
in liberation.
</P>
<P>
   While the employees say the figure presents blacks as inferior
to whites, Assemblyman John McEneny says it represents how most of
America felt in the years following the Civil War and not today's
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're talking about an absolutely magnificent epic mural,
which reflects the feelings of the time, particularly of
northerners in 1876,'' said McEneny, a Democrat from Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The mural, which is alternately known as the ''Grand Centennial
Painting,'' ''The United States,'' ''The Genius of America,'' and
''The United States of America,'' hangs at the rear of the stage in
Chancellors Hall of the state Education Building.
</P>
<P>
   The hall is used mainly for education staff meetings and a few
public events. The public can view the mural if they ask in
advance, Education Department spokesman Alan Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who complained about the mural over the past two years
were mostly black and were required to attend the staff meetings,
according to Ray. The decision to cover the mural with drapes was
made less than a year ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The flap over the mural was first reported Sunday by the New
York Post.
</P>
<P>
   McEneny, who is also an Albany and New York state historian,
said the figures are allegorical and should not be viewed as a
degrading representation of present-day blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the artist was impressed with the degradation of
slavery, which is unquestionably the worst horror in American
history, and he wanted to show that this was a person who was truly
degraded in society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The man is obviously in a very emotional state and if he's
saying anything, it's, 'Free at last, free at last, thank God
almighty, we're free at last.' It's a representation of the
extraordinary freedom given to this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray declined to comment on McEneny's interpretation of the
section of the mural some have found offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've reached a very reasonable, balanced position in which
it's available for viewing by anyone who wants to see it,'' Ray
said.
</P>
<P>
   When outside meetings are held in the hall, the mural is
uncovered if attendees ask, Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   The mural, painted by French artist Adolph deYvon, was rumored
to have cost New York City merchant A.T. Stewart $100,000 when he
commissioned it in 1870, according to the Education Department.
Stewart wanted to hang the mural in his home, but when he saw the
huge panel, he realized he couldn't get it into the building, much
less hang it there.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart purchased the Grand Union Hotel in Saratoga Springs in
1872 and four years later placed the mural in the grand ballroom,
where it remained until the building was razed in 1952. The
construction company responsible for the demolition donated it to
the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its historical significance, McEneny said even the
uncovering of the mural at request is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a number of areas throughout Albany that are
underappreciated and need to be explained to the public, rather
than made less available,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> State tries using collection agency for court-imposed fines  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state is going to try using a private
collection agency on a trial basis to see if it has better success
than the courts at making people pay fines and surcharges imposed
by judges.
</P>
<P>
   In a strategy aimed ultimately at boosting fees paid to lawyers
who represent indigent people in New York, the state Office of
Court Administration said Tuesday that Outsourcing Solutions Inc.
has been retained to collect money due the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The company's bill collectors at first will seek some of the
480,000 delinquent judgments outstanding in six courts: Rochester
City Court, Queens Supreme Court, Suffolk District Court, Suffolk
County Court, Nassau District Court and New York City Criminal
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Court administrators believe the aggressive collection methods
of professionals in the field may generate tens of millions of
dollars in unpaid fines and surcharges the state imposes on various
offenses. But they had no official estimate Tuesday of how much
they expect Outsourcing Solutions to collect.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been the tradition that everybody in the criminal
justice system throws up our hands and says, 'We're not a
collection agency,''' Jonathan Lippman, the state's chief
administrative judge, said Tuesday. ''The courts say, 'We're not a
collection agency.' The executive branch, the DAs, they all say,
'We're not a collection agency.'''
</P>
<P>
   In consequence, Lippman said, huge sums due state and county
governments through court-imposed fines and surcharges are not
being collected by anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Lippman predicted it would take about six months for Outsourcing
Solutions to show what state Chief Judge Judith Kaye and other
administrators believe to be the case, that serious collection
efforts will yield significant funds.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Kaye proposed using revenues raised through hiring a
private collection agency to improve fees for so-called assigned
counsels. Those court-appointed lawyers are paid $40 an hour for
in-court work and $25 for out-of-court work on behalf of indigent
clients -- a pay schedule which administrators say has caused the
pool of lawyers willing to volunteer for such work to dry up.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye proposed increasing the assigned counsel fees to $75 an
hour for felony and Family Court cases and to $60 an hour for
non-felony cases. But Gov. George Pataki has been hostile to that
proposal, and the state Legislature refused to dedicate the $80
million or so it is estimated would be needed to nearly double
assigned counsel fees.
</P>
<P>
   Lippman said court administrators expect their new program to
show that uncollected fines and surcharges are a viable way of
paying for increased assigned-counsel fees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think there is no better revenue stream and no better
symmetry than to use money collected from offenders to pay for
representation for the indigent,'' Lippman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Outsourcing Solutions contract calls for the company to
receive 14.9 percent of what it collects in this state fiscal year
up to a maximum of $250,000, according to Office of Court
Administration spokesman David Bookstaver.
</P>
<P>
   Lippman said he does not expect New Yorkers to criticize his
office for bringing on board a private collection agency with its
presumably aggressive techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would do a disservice to the public and would not be
accountable to the wide, broad public by not going after these
funds,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Multimillion dollar settlement to enable boy to move closer tomother  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LYONS, N.Y. (AP) -- Ten years after a 9-year-old boy was hit by a
truck when leaving his school via a street that had no crosswalk,
sidewalk or traffic light, his mother reached a settlement that
could bring up to $37 million for his care.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Ernest will receive an initial payment of $348,250 under the
settlement filed earlier this month in state Supreme Court. Wayne
County will have to pay $660,000, in addition to purchasing an
annuity and paying $6,430 per month. Each year, that amount will
increase by 3 percent. The Red Creek school district must pay $1.4
million and make monthly payments of $12,834 for the rest of
Christopher Knopp's life. Each year, those monthly payments will
also increase by 3 percent. Truck driver Gordon Carvey will have to
pay $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Knopp's mother is ''very pleased that Christopher's care is
going to be provided for the rest of his life and he is going to be
protected,'' her lawyer, Richard DeValk, said in the Geneva Finger
Lakes Times' Tuesday editions. ''The best that would have happened
if we didn't receive the settlement is he would have gotten
released into a group home where he would not have supervision, and
would have been more likely to injure himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Knopp was hit April 2, 1990, when he dodged behind a bus and
tried to cross the road. Carvey said his view was obstructed by a
bus.
</P>
<P>
   Today Knopp has permanent brain injuries, double vision, a
blood-filled tumor on his leg that hasn't healed since the
accident, and suffers tremors that prevent him from holding a
drink.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest said her son remains at the developmental level of a
second-grader and has behavioral problems related to his brain
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest and DeValk maintained that school district officials were
at fault because all students were dismissed with buses that day. A
school policy at the time called for students who walked home to be
dismissed only after buses had left school grounds. The mother also
said Wayne County was negligent for failing to build a sidewalk or
crosswalk for the street in front of the school.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, school officials had urged county and town officials to
extend a sidewalk from the village of Red Creek along the highway
to the school, and to put a crosswalk that would link the sidewalk
to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after Knopp was struck, a sidewalk was constructed
along that section of road.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest's case was twice dismissed, first in the Wayne County
Supreme Court and then in the Fourth Division Appellate Court in
Rochester. But last summer, the state Court of Appeals overturned
those rulings, stating Ernest could go forward with a jury trial
against the school, the county and the truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement will cover Knopp's medical care and enable him to
move out of a rehabilitation center in Greenfield, N.H., and into a
private home near his mother in Cato, in Cayuga County.

<P>
   ALFRED, N.Y. (AP) -- As a graduating college student in 1969,
Hillary Rodham Clinton made a well-known commencement speech
decrying the government establishment.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the first lady and U.S. Senate candidate promoted
public life and acknowledged to a college audience that her
generation's cynicism may have hurt political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know many people have been turned off by politics in the
last several years. In fact, I think it started in the 1960s,''
Clinton said. ''People became very cynical and withdrawn and that
leaves the field to people you may not agree with, to people who
have a very different agenda and ideology. I don't think it is in
any of our interests to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of a packed 500-seat auditorium at the New York State
College of Ceramics at Alfred University, Clinton told students
that they should get involved in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ''This campaign has much more to do with your futures than with
mine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate candidate made her appeal as she began a three-day
foray into traditionally conservative upstate New York, a key
battleground in her Senate race against New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly in her 45-minute speech, the first lady praised the
policies of her husband and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new Democrat philosophy that the president and the vice
president championed and really symbolized clearly points a
direction for our state and our country to head in,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady drew cheers and applause when she used one of her
favorite lines on the students: ''If we give signing bonuses to
athletes, we ought to give signing bonuses to teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, while not criticizing Giuliani by name, did attack
Republicans in general for pushing school vouchers that would allow
parents public funds to send their children to private or parochial
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some places that call themselves churches that set
up schools in garages that I would not want my tax dollars
supporting,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous anti-Clinton signs, including one that read, ''Stand by
your man -- in Arkansas,'' were posted along the road leading into
Alfred.
</P>
<P>
   Placards at the university were more friendly. One suggested,
''Hillary Rocks'' while another said: ''Men want Hillary.''

<HEADLINE> Huntsman To Announce $125M Gift  </HEADLINE>
By HANNAH WOLFSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Chemical magnate Jon Huntsman, who has
spent $151 million of his own money to fund a cancer center at the
University of Utah, plans to donate another $125 million to the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement is planned today. The bulk of the money, $100
million, will pay for construction of a six-story hospital to treat
patients along with the Huntsman Cancer Institute. The other $25
million will go to an outreach program with Utah's largest health
care provider, Intermountain Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel I'm a very lucky man because this is such a privilege
to make a donation of this kind,'' Huntsman, 62, told The
Associated Press on Tuesday. ''Years ago and through my life this
was something I never felt would be possible or achievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Huntsman, who built and owns Huntsman Chemical Corp., the
world's largest privately owned chemical company, has always
claimed he made his fortune just to give it away. Earlier this
month, he sold off one of his subsidiaries, Huntsman Packaging
Corp., to Chase Capital Partners in a transaction valued at $1.065
billion, saying the sale would support his philanthropic ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sale, Forbes magazine estimated his personal wealth
at $3.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire's beneficence began in earnest in 1995 with a
$90 million pledge to start a ''cancer campus'' at the university
his wife and children attended.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually donated another $61 million to help finish off the
institute, which treats some patients but has no overnight care.
The money also helped lure 300 researchers from the top
laboratories in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Huntsman's second gift comes seven months after the institute
opened.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't the sort of thing that happens every day up here,''
said university spokesman Fred Esplin. ''This is a very big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million of the bequest that goes to the university
would rank 15th on the Chronicle of Higher Education's list of
private grants to universities, tied with more than a dozen similar
donations.
</P>
<P>
   But if Huntsman's cumulative $250-million gift to the school was
considered en masse, it would land in fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money will be used to build the 55-bed Clinical
Research Hospital next door to the research institute, set to open
late 2002 or early 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Huntsman, who has fought off prostate and mouth cancer and lost
his mother, father and stepfather to the disease, says his
high-tech hospital will bear a personal touch, with comfortable
interiors and sweeping mountain views.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'd like to do is ensure that the cancer patients don't
worry about cancer while they're there,'' Huntsman said.
''Everything we do is centered around hope.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to spread the hope around, Huntsman has set aside
$25 million to establish a cancer partnership with Intermountain
Health Care, which provides hospital care for about 60 percent of
the cancer patients in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming. The money will be
used to expand facilities at IHC hospitals and share new
information from the Huntsman Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ''The object's to get (promising research) out as fast as we
can, not only to other hospitals in Utah and the Intermountain
region but to other hospitals around the country and the world,''
Huntsman said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Huntsman is content with weekly visits to patients in
his institute's chemotherapy center.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great honor to go there and tell them they're going to
be fine and they look beautiful and handsome,'' Huntsman said.
''I've been in those stations before and it's nice to have a
friendly face -- especially someone whose name's on the building.''

One Dead in Texas Prison Riot
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LAMESA, Texas (AP) -- A riot at a West Texas prison Tuesday night left at
least one inmate dead and as many as 20 others injured, authorities said. The
riot began at about 8:45 p.m. at the Preston Smith Unit in Lamesa and was under
control within a few hours, the Dawson County Sheriff's Department told Lubbock
television station KBCD. Twenty inmates have been taken to University Medical
Center in Lubbock for treatment. No guards were involved in the melee, which
included a fire. The all-male prison, about 60 miles south of Lubbock, holds

as the San Jose Sharks tightened up on defense to eliminate the St. Louis Blues
in the first round of their Western Conference playoff series with a 3-1 victory
Tuesday night. The Blues, who seemingly seized control with a 6-2 Game 6 victory
on the road, landed with a thud in the seventh game in their quest to become the
16th team in NHL history to rally from a 3-1 series deficit. The Presidents'

<HEADLINE> Canseco Pulls Himself From Lineup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Cuban native Jose Canseco changed his
mind and elected not to play for in Tampa Bay Tuesday night against
Kansas City, joining a work stoppage by Cuban-Americans to protest
Elian Gonzalez's removal from the Miami home of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco originally was scheduled to start as the designated
hitter, batting fourth. But about 30 minutes a before the game, it
was announced that he had been scratched and replaced by Bubba
Trammell.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just thought it was the right thing to do,'' said Canseco,
who owns a financial services business in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He said he originally thought the work stoppage was only by
Cuban players with the Florida Marlins in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It became more of a national thing than what I thought. That's
about it. It's over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco was hitting .253 with three home runs and eight RBIs and
only watched as the Devil Rays blew a 5-1 lead and lost 7-6 on
pitcher Albie Lopez's throwing error in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was uncomfortable not being in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something you have to do. It's tough when you're not
playing,'' he said. ''It's a close game. It's a one-run ballgame
and you want to get in there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had ''no idea'' if the work stoppage by
Cuban-Americans would draw more national attention to their
feelings over the government's seizure of the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's over with and hopefully everything continues from here,''
Canseco said.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild said he supported Canseco's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to him before the game. He was aware that some other
players were not going to play, players away from Miami, which made
his decision a lot tougher,'' Rothschild said. ''He thought it was
just a local thing down in Miami and that would be it. But it was
different than that. It's something away from baseball that affects
a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Trammell entered the game hitting .320 with two home runs and
four RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban-American protest over the Gonzalez case was marked by
workers staying home, students skipping school and businesses
keeping their doors shut.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 11, Blue Jays 2  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. AP) -- Tim Hudson allowed two hits in seven
innings, and Ben Grieve homered and had four RBIs as the Oakland
Athletics broke out of a slump with an 11-2 victory over the
Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Long, recalled Monday from Triple-A Sacramento, had
three hits, including his first major league home run and Matt
Stairs added a two-run double for the A's, who won for just the
second time in their last eight home games.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (2-2) had struggled in his last two outings, allowing 11
runs over four innings and getting knocked out in the third inning
of his last start in Cleveland by a line drive from Roberto Alomar
that struck him in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   But against the Blue Jays, he showed the same kind of dominance
that he flashed in winning his first start April 4, when he took a
no-hitter into the seventh inning against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson fanned eight, striking out the side in the first inning
after giving up a leadoff single to Jose Cruz Jr. He didn't give up
another hit until there were two outs in the seventh, when Brad
Fullmer connected for his fifth homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Halladay (2-3) allowed nine runs on eight hits in four-plus
innings. He has now given up 27 runs in 18 innings over his last
four starts for an ERA of 13.50 in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland took command from the outset, scoring four runs in the
first inning on Stairs' bases-loaded double, Grieve's RBI single
and a wild pitch allowing Stairs to score from third.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Menechino walked ahead of Long's homer. The rookie
connected on an 0-2 pitch, driving it over the right field wall.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse for Halladay in the fifth, when he gave up
successive singles to Jason Giambi and Olmedo Saenz and walked
Stairs. John Bale relieved and issued a bases-loaded walk to
Grieve. Ramon Hernandez had a sacrifice fly and Long was hit by a
pitch with the bases loaded to make it 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   After Giambi singled to lead off the sixth and with two outs,
Grieve hit his third homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Halladay fell to 0-3 in four career starts against Oakland.
... Toronto hit its AL-leading 42nd home run in April, tying a club
record for the month. The Blue Jays also had 42 homers in April
1996. ... X-rays on Marty Cordova's sore left ankle were negative
but he wasn't in Toronto's starting lineup for a second day in a
row. ... Oakland right-hander Kevin Appier, who left Monday night's
game against Toronto in the eighth inning because of a right
forearm strain, probably will have his next start pushed back by a
day or two to give the swelling in his arm a chance to go down.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 4, Angels 2  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Bobby Higginson's RBI single with two
outs in the eighth inning Tuesday night lifted Detroit to a 4-2
victory over the Anaheim Angels, ending the Tigers' eight-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson singled off Kent Bottenfield (2-4) to score Luis
Polonia from second, breaking a 2-2 tie. Polonia, leading off the
inning, reached base on a throwing error by shortstop Benji Gil.
</P>
<P>
   Polonia moved to second on Brad Asmus' groundout, and Juan
Encarnacion walked. Bottenfield got Juan Gonzalez on a flyout, but
Higginson followed with his sharp single to center that chased the
Angels' starter.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers scored again in the ninth when Deivi Cruz doubled and
scored on Polonia's single to short and ensuing wild throw by Gil.
That made the final two Detroit runs unearned.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Poole (1-0) pitched two-thirds of an inning for the win
after Hideo Nomo limited the Angels to two runs in 6 1-3 innings.
Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley, who rejoined the Tigers off the disabled list
earlier in the day, hit his first homer of the season, a solo shot
in the fifth, to tie it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy's two-run homer, his second, accounted for all the
Angels' scoring in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Easley was placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to
April 10, with a strained muscle in his rib cage. It was discovered
last weekend that he also had a hairline fracture in his right
wrist, the result of being hit by a pitch on April 5 at Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   He made a rehabilitation appearance at Toledo and hit a two-run
homer on Monday night, then left to join the Tigers in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim went up 2-1 on Kennedy's homer off Nomo after Darin
Erstad singled. Encarnacion's RBI single gave Detroit a 1-0 lead in
the first.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, who escaped a bases-loaded jam later in the third by
striking out Troy Glaus, gave up six hits in 6 1-3 innings. He
struck out five and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield gave up three runs on eight hits in 7 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
NOTES: Anaheim right-hander Tim Belcher, coming back from
offseason arm surgery, gave up one run on five hits in five innings
Tuesday night in a rehab assignment with Triple-A Edmonton. Belcher
walked one, struck out one and threw 60 pitches, 43 of them
strikes. ... First-year manager Mike Scioscia said he would have
the Angels running this season, and they have -- stealing (21) bases
in 22 games. Last year, they stole a total of 71 bases, 25th in the
majors, and did not get their 22nd steal until their 59th game. ...
Doctors told Easley that playing will not aggravate his wrist
injury. ... To make room for Easley on the roster, the Tigers
outrighted outfielder Karim Garcia to Triple-A Toledo.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Giuliani trade charges  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Rudolph Giuliani
should apologize for calling federal agents in the Elian Gonzalez
raid storm troopers.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York City mayor stood by his remarks. His camp
instead attacked the first lady's fund raising, saying Democrats
were trying to hide soft-money donors to her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a new Zogby International poll of voters in
GOP-leaning upstate New York showed the mayor leading the first
lady by 14 percent. The upstate poll showed Giuliani with 52
percent and Clinton with 38 percent. The poll has a margin of error
of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who just signed a civility pledge promising a clean
U.S. Senate campaign, said she agreed with the Federal Law
Enforcement Officers Association, which is demanding an apology
from Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the mayor's inflammatory and divisive rhetoric is
part of a pattern that he has engaged in for quite some time,'' the
first lady said during a campaign stop Tuesday in Westchester
County.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Saturday that the federal government had
''trampled the wishes of (Elian's) mother this morning with guns
and with storm troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   He had this to say Tuesday: ''You do not use loaded automatic
weapons to remove 6-year-old children. Why the attorney general
made the choice to have them dress in battle fatigues and with
automatic weapons that were loaded is a misjudgment of very, very
large proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's campaign targeted Clinton's fund raising, which has
been a frequent line of attack. This time the campaign was critical
of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's decision not to
immediately disclose soft-money donations to New York Senate 2000,
a committee set up to support Clinton's Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money is not subject to $2,000 campaign donation limits for
individuals. It can be used for issue ads and party-building
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been caught in another of the campaign scams they
imported from Arkansas and perfected in Washington,'' Giuliani
spokeswoman Kim Serafin said of the president and first lady.
</P>
<P>
   DSCC officials said they made an accounting decision not to
detail soft-money donations every month when they file their
reports because the accounting involved was too onerous.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they plan to file those reports when the money is
transferred from a joint fund-raising account set up for the
candidate. New York Senate 2000 raised about $500,000 in soft money
in the first quarter of this year, officials said Tuesday. That is
on top of the roughly $700,000 in soft money raised last year. A
new account set up by Republicans for Giuliani raise nearly
$500,000 in just one month.
</P>
<P>
   DSCC political director Jim Jordan said ''the Clinton campaign
has no control over or knowledge of the administrative
technicalities'' of the account. He asserted the DSCC was following
federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Interfaith Alliance announced that the first lady
had signed its pledge to run a clean campaign. By signing the
group's Framework of Civility for Political Candidates, candidates
promise to avoid personal attacks, take responsibility for the
conduct of advisers and allies and make documentation available for
factual allegations made about opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is also calling on Giuliani to sign the pledge. He
has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush signed the
pledge in December.

   Luciano was on his way to pick up a dispatched fare when Mario
King jumped into his cab at a Bronx intersection. Luciano told him
to get out and the argument ensued, police said.
</P>
<P>
   As King exited the car, so did Luciano -- allegedly with a metal
bar. Luciano then allegedly hit King and drove off. His cab company
notified police about what happened, and Luciano was arrested. King
was listed in serious but stable condition at Jacobi Hospital hours
after the alleged attack.
</P>
<P>
   Luciano had likely heard of Monday night's shooting death of
livery cab driver Jose Olivares. The 35-year-old cabbie was the
eighth driver killed on the job this year. The Dominican Republic
native was shot once in the head shortly after 10 p.m. during a
botched robbery attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four passengers in the cab were injured when the car
crashed into an apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers -- two men and two teen-agers -- were charged with
attempted robbery, murder and criminal possession of a weapon,
police said. They were identified as John Rivera, 19; Ramon Anaya,
18; Norberto Hernandez, 16; and Jasmine Valentine, 16.
</P>
<P>
   News of Olivares' death spread quickly, and may have caused some
panic, as in Luciano's case.
</P>
<P>
   ''He thought he was going to be robbed,'' said a dispatcher
named Segfredo at Watson Car Service in the Bronx, where Luciano
has worked for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates concerned for livery drivers' safety say many cabbies
are driving scared these days. Eight drivers have been killed so
far this year, compared with 11 for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like a nightmare,'' said Fernando Mateo, president of
the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers. ''You have not
finished mourning one when you are suddenly arranging for another
wake and funeral procession. When will these killings stop?''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo said Olivares had spoken out about the dangers facing
drivers on the same night he was killed. ''If I get robbed or I get
killed, believe me, I'm going to take them with me,''' Mateo quoted
Olivares as having said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the eight slain cabbies had installed bulletproof
partitions in their cars, police said. Olivares had intended to
have a partition installed but had not been able to because the
shops that do that work were swamped with orders, said Eddie
Almonte, manager of Excellent Car Services, where Olivares had
worked for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the recent killings, the Taxi and Limousine
Commission voted unanimously last week to require all drivers to
install either bulletproof partitions or digital security cameras
in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the TLC made it mandatory for yellow cabs and livery
cars owned by more than one driver to have the partitions. But cars
owned and operated by individual drivers -- 90 percent of all livery
cars -- could have either partitions or tiny surveillance cameras
installed behind the rearview mirror. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
recently pledged $5 million toward a grant program to help pay for
the security devices.
</P>
<P>
   The recent increase in driver murders and the new requirement
has apparently overwhelmed shops that install partitions, which are
cheaper to install than cameras. Partitions cost between $250 to
$350, and cameras start at $600, the TLC has said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My understanding is that there are waiting lists,'' said TLC
spokesman Allan Fromberg. ''They (the shops) are doing the best
they can, they are operating to capacity. Many hundreds of
partitions have been put in already.''

<HEADLINE> Poor Outlook for Midwestern Farmers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STILLWATER, Minn. (AP) -- Midwestern farmers are heading into
another growing season with an unpleasant outlook in terms of
commodity prices, government aid and weather.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for major crops grown in the region are likely to be
below most farmers' production costs; dairy prices have sunk with
crop prices, matching 25 year lows; and large areas of the country
are under threat of drought.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty also hovers about whether the government will come
to the rescue after bailing farmers out of financial problems for
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is in the process of passing a $7 billion farm aid
package for the start of this growing season, and more could be on
the way if drought and weather damage to crops becomes measurable
later, congressional leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   Dairyman George Rydeen, who farms near Stillwater, said he hopes
Asia's improving economy will help farmers through increased
exports.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even our milk prices are tied to grains,'' he said. ''Cheap
feed leads to more milk and lower milk prices. We've had two pretty
good years in dairying, so we knew what would happen. More cows,
and milk production is up.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather provides another way for getting grain supplies back in
balance with demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The long-range weather maps I look at show widespread
drought,'' Rydeen said. ''We're on the edge of it, so we have to
figure we will get a crop.''
</P>
<P>
   Drought could bring higher prices for farmers before the year is
out, said Helen Pound, an analyst and trader with Goldenberg
Hehmeyer &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   She said, however, that farmers and grain companies have huge
supplies of grain to work with if this year's crop is reduced by
poor growing conditions. Port elevators at Duluth, Minn., and
Superior, Wis., have 18 million bushels of wheat on hand. Farms and
country elevators are loaded with corn and soybeans for export.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of grain in storage that would find some happy
buyers if drought happens,'' Pound said.

   BLACKFOOT, Idaho (AP) -- U.S. and Canadian potato growers are
creating an alliance to help them survive an unsettled agriculture
market and get increased prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're at a point in time where we need to know what each other
is doing, and we need to tell each other what we're doing, all the
way to what's happening at the bank,'' said Duane Maatz, president
of the Red River Valley Potato Growers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Potato Marketing Association of North America, Potato
Growers of Idaho, bargaining cooperatives, and state and provincial
grower associations agreed to create a communications network.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed to have each growing region determine its
production costs and the potential impact that increasing oil
prices will have on production expenses. They plan to meet and
evaluate the information, which will be used when negotiating 2001
potato-processing contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations involved in the agreement are the Potato
Growers of Alberta, the Potato Growers of Washington, the Malheur
Potato Bargaining Association and the Wisconsin Potato and
Vegetable Growers.

<HEADLINE> Hiroshima Survivors Protest at UN  </HEADLINE>
By IAN JAMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- At 8:15 a.m. on Aug. 6, 1945, Setsuko
Nakamura looked out a window and saw a blinding flash of light.
Instantly, the 13-year-old girl had the sensation of floating as
the wooden building collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   She awoke in darkness, unable to move. She heard the faint cries
of other girls, saying ''Help me!'' Many of those voices would
never cry again. But someone loosened the timbers over Setsuko, and
she was able to crawl toward the light and live on.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five years later, she stood outside the United Nations on
Tuesday with a simple message from Hiroshima: Never again.
</P>
<P>
   While representatives from around the world met across the
street at a U.N. conference reviewing the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty, Setsuko -- who took the last name Thurlow after marrying a
Canadian man -- spoke to 50 people, urging them to look at the
hundreds of Japanese names written on two yellow banners.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are 350 names of my schoolmates and teachers -- only from
my own school, just one school among many schools,'' she said,
clenching a fist. ''They all perished, and most of them vaporized
in the center of the city. The image of these girls and loved ones
drive and compel me to speak out against the cruelty and inhumanity
of nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The atomic bomb dropped by a U.S. plane over southwestern Japan
killed 140,000 people and leveled Hiroshima. The bombing of
Nagasaki three days later killed 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Thurlow recalled that when the blast struck, she was one mile
from its center, working with 30 other girls from her school in a
military office to aid the war effort. As she left the collapsed
building for a nearby hillside, she saw the devastation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like twilight because of all the dust and dirt and the
particles up in the air that were sucked up in the mushroom
cloud,'' she said. ''It was like hell on earth. The streams and
streams of injured people were just slowly shuffling from the
central part of the city to the hillside.''
</P>
<P>
   Their skin and flesh were hanging free, and some people were
burned black, she said. The city burned all day and all night.
</P>
<P>
   One of Thurlow's sisters, and the sister's 4-year-old son, were
walking on a bridge at the time of the explosion. They were badly
burned and only lived several days, Thurlow said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they died, the soldiers just threw them in a ditch,
poured gasoline, threw a lighted match,'' she said. ''But you know,
I stood and watched it. I couldn't even shed tears. I was so
emotionally overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents survived, and she went with them to live with an
uncle outside the city. In the weeks and months after the blast,
she searched her body for the purple spots that people said meant
certain death. She bled internally and lost hair.
</P>
<P>
   At 68, Thurlow said she is generally healthy, although she has a
thyroid problem that worries her. She lives in Toronto with her
husband, and they have two sons and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A retired social worker, Thurlow is concerned about U.S. plans
to build a national missile defense system that critics say would
lead to a new arms race. It bothers her that even after so many
years, some people don't seem to understand her message.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes I feel angry, sometimes sad,'' she said. ''I think
the majority of the people are sleepwalking in this nuclear age.
They have to come out of the sleepwalking again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bomb survivors, or hibakusha, as they are known in Japan,
erected a display inside the United Nations with photographs of
bodies strewn among the rubble and orphans scavenging for food.
</P>
<P>
   Sunao Tsuboi, 75, said he was on his way to school in Hiroshima
when the bomb fell. He was thrown 30 feet by the blast, and scars
remain on his face and arms.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the crowd outside the United Nations, he finished
his speech with a shouted plea: ''No more Hiroshima! No more
Nagasaki! No more hibakusha!''

<HEADLINE> Leo Lays Egg in Clinton Interview  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe Leonardo DiCaprio should stick to the big
screen.
</P>
<P>
   His interview with President Clinton on ABC's ''Planet Earth
2000'' was a shipwreck in the ratings department. Viewers didn't
seem to care about the special on global warming, which had left
some at ABC upset because an actor was sent to do a journalist's
job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Planet Earth 2000'' drew 3.9 million viewers Saturday night,
Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday. It had a smaller audience than
any other prime-time show last week on ABC, CBS, NBC or Fox, except
for Fox's airing of the movie, ''The Full Monty.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio's audience was about one-seventh of what Regis Philbin
drew Sunday in the week's most-watched show, ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's dramatic government raid in the Elian Gonzalez case
boosted the ratings for CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC. The three
cable news networks had an average audience of nearly 2.6 million
that day, up from their average of 661,000 for the first three
months of the year. CNN, with 1.4 million viewers, easily led its
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ABC won the prime-time ratings race for the 17th week in a row,
with an average audience of 12.1 million (8.1 rating, 14 share).
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the May ratings ''sweeps,'' the real race in the
season standings is for second place behind ABC.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, last season's champ, will try to protect its narrow lead
with specials like the ''Jesus'' miniseries, a Judds musical
reunion, a movie with the ''Dukes of Hazzard'' crew and the
series-ending ''Cosby.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC, only one-tenth of a ratings point behind CBS, will counter
with ''The '70s'' and ''Jason and the Argonauts'' miniseries, a
''Growing Up Brady'' movie and episodes of ''Friends'' with Bruce
Willis and Tom Selleck.
</P>
<P>
   CBS had an average of 10.7 million viewers last week (7.4
rating, 13 share), and NBC was at 10.1 million (7.3, 13). Fox had
7.4 million (4.9, 9), UPN had 4.1 million (2.7, 5), the WB had 2.7
million (2.1, 4) and Pax TV had 1.2 million (0.9, 2).
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ''World News Tonight'' drew 9.7 million viewers last week
(7.1 rating, 16 share). NBC's ''Nightly News'' had 9.5 million
viewers (7.2, 16) and the ''CBS Evening News'' had 7.9 million
viewers (6.1, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of April 17-23, the top 10 shows, their networks
and ratings were ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC,
17.0; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 16.8;
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 16.7; ''The
Practice,'' ABC, 11.7; ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 11.3;
''NYPD Blue,'' ABC, 10.4; ''60 Minutes,'' CBS, 10.3; ''ER,'' NBC,
10.1; ''20/20 Downtown,'' ABC, 10.1; ''Becker,'' CBS, 9.9; ''Dharma
&AMP; Greg,'' ABC, 9.9; ''Law and Order,'' NBC, 9.9; Touched By an
Angel, CBS, 9.9.

<HEADLINE> Elian Strike Closes Little Havana  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- It is the protest that refuses to die, at least in
Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Americans angry over the Elian Gonzalez case plotted their
next moves Tuesday in the midst of a strike that shut down much of
the neighborhood and other parts of Miami. It affected even
baseball, America's pastime and a Cuban passion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will buy nothing today,'' 70-year-old Angelo Gutierrez said.
''And on Saturday I will march in protest.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a mass protest has been circulating since federal agents
seized the 6-year-old boy over the weekend. Others said they would
ride in bus caravans to protest in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday -- called ''Martes Muerte'' or ''Dead Tuesday'' --
businesses kept iron gates closed, workers stayed home and students
skipped school. Police said there were four arrests for disorderly
conduct and other charges, a far cry from the violence last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Larger corporations closed some operations -- seven supermarkets
shut their doors and a McDonald's in Little Havana closed, its flag
at half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   Sony canceled its ''Evening of Showcases,'' which featured such
Latin stars as singer Gloria Estefan, who supported Elian's Miami
relatives. The event was part of the festivities surrounding the
Billboard Latin Music Conference and Awards that began Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The strike also affected Tuesday night's Florida Marlins-San
Francisco Giants baseball game in Miami. Eight players sat out,
including Marlins third baseman Mike Lowell, whose wife is Cuban
and parents are Cuban exiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of Americans and Latins feel this way. You don't
have to be Cuban to support this,'' said Lowell, who was born in
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants did fine without their two players, winning 6-4,
while the boycott hurt the Marlins. With only 19 players available,
their starting pitcher was forced to pinch hit in the 11th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Though Miami school officials had no immediate attendance
figures, many children joined their striking parents. Bank teller
Dora Irizarry brought her two boys to the home of Elian's Miami
relatives, who have battled in court to keep the boy from being
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is horrible, horrible,'' Irizarry said. ''It's important
for them to see this. It's important for them to know what freedom
is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street at the closed Zagami's Market, a Cuban flag hung
over the store sign. Below was a handwritten sign that read:
''Clinton a traitor. Shame on you.''
</P>
<P>
   While 2,581 employees of Miami-Dade County took the day off,
much of the metropolitan area -- home to some 800,000 Cubans -- was
unaffected. The bustling airport and Port of Miami had no
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm Cuban,'' said Ileana Casasola, a supervisor at the airport
where only two employees honored the strike. ''I'd love to go
support my people, but the problem is the airport is a busy
place.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Miami Herald, no reporters took the day off. Several
support staff took vacation days at the Herald and its
Spanish-language daily, El Nuevo Herald, said Robin Reiter, vice
president of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   One impromptu street protest several miles southwest of Little
Havana grew to more than 300 by nightfall, and Spanish-language
radio announced the names of businesses that closed and those that
stayed open.
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening, about 130 protesters gathered outside the
Freedom Tower, a former customs building where many Cubans entered
the United States in the 1960s. They waved flags and signs and
chanted ''Libertad'' as basketball fans streamed into the American
Airlines Arena for a Miami Heat playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American public thinks we are angry at them, but what we
are is angry at their government,'' said 21-year-old Alberto Baez,
who held an American flag upside down and garnished with black
material.
</P>
<P>
   Across Biscayne Bay in Miami Beach, tourists lined up with
cameras as about a thousand people -- many of them wearing black
clothing and electrical tape over their mouths -- quietly walked 30
blocks from trendy South Beach to the city's Holocaust museum and
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want international tourists to see what we are feeling,''
said John Suarez, a Florida International University student who
helped organize the procession.
</P>
<P>
   Some tourists were indifferent, if not annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, I'm a little tired of hearing about it,'' said Jackie
Miller, a tourist from Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> Elian's New Home Peaceful, Secluded  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER THORNE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEENSTOWN, Md. (AP) -- For nearly five months, the sounds
outside Elian Gonzalez's bedroom in Miami included the buzz from
hordes of reporters and the bullhorn-dominated chants of
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   He is now at the secluded Wye River conference center, where
geese honk on the grounds of the 1,100-acre estate that was the
home of one of the state's first governors, William Paca.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, along with his father, stepmother and baby half-brother,
on Tuesday were moved to a two-story, white farmhouse on the
center's grounds. They are awaiting court action on whether the
6-year-old boy should be granted an asylum hearing, State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Wye River was chosen because ''it's good for a youngster who can
use the grounds. And it's large enough so that potentially the two
families could both be there but not be on top of each other,''
said a senior Justice Department official, requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The family had been staying at Andrews Air Force Base since
Saturday, when Elian was forcibly removed from the home of his
Miami relatives. The relatives have been turned away each time
they've sought to see Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The conference center, 70 miles east of Washington, is perhaps
best known as the site of the Middle East peace negotiations in
1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds are the site of Houghton House. The 25-room Georgian
mansion is filled with colonial antiques and has an 18th
century-style garden with a swimming pool. Legend has it that
Paca's wife haunts the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The complex also has two other executive retreats, each with its
own accommodations and recreational facilities. The 26-room River
House has an impressive view of the Wye River, and the Wye Woods
campus has lodges connected by boardwalks.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye complex is run by the Aspen Institute, a nonprofit
organization dedicated to leadership development and critical
issues facing society. It also has facilities in Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Its activities include seminars in which leaders from various
backgrounds read and discuss great works of literature to gain a
framework for making decisions, said Janet Froetscher, senior vice
president for seminars and communications.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor said he didn't think Elian's visit would cause
nearly the commotion the 1998 peace talks caused, when Secret
Service agents shut down the road leading to the estate.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the only time we had security that high, when the
president was here,'' said Kevin Compton, operations manager at
Pintail Point Farm, which runs hunting, boating and recreational
outings. ''There's constantly stuff going on down there that
requires security, but we don't ever feel it.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Dialysis Fiber Can Break Down  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A fiber used in dialysis machines across the
country can break down with age, causing such severe reactions in
kidney patients as vision and hearing loss, according to a study
published today.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery came after seven patients at an Alabama hospital
had bad reactions within 24 hours of undergoing dialysis in 1996,
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Their
symptoms ranged from near blindness and deafness to intense
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that the breakdown of old fiber making up the
membranes of the patients' dialyzers -- which filter blood before it
is returned to the patient -- probably caused the reactions by
introducing chemical byproducts of the fiber into their blood.
</P>
<P>
   All of the patients had been treated the same day using
dialyzers that were more than 11 years old. Five died within 13
months, but researchers said their deaths could not be definitively
linked to the dialyzers.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration's findings were
reported in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Matthew Kuehnert, a CDC epidemiologist and co-author of the
study, said it is extremely rare that dialyzers that old are used.
Even so, he said the study is of note for all hospitals that
perform dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly raises a question that it likely does apply to
all dialyzers that use this type of material that can degrade,''
Kuehnert said.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 patients in the United States are undergoing
dialysis treatment. The CDC said 43 percent of dialysis centers use
equipment that includes cellulose acetate, the fiber used in the
Alabama cases.
</P>
<P>
   The material is generally safe, said Joseph Hutter, an FDA
chemical engineer and lead author of the study. But it can degrade
after several years, allowing chemicals from the fiber to mix with
the blood being pumped into a patient's body through the artificial
kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Two other patients who went through the Alabama hospital's
dialysis unit the day of the outbreak were treated with dialyzers
that were less than a year old and did not have adverse reactions.
</P>
<P>
   After the Alabama cases, the FDA and the CDC sent letters to all
U.S. dialysis centers suggesting the centers should check with the
manufacturer before using old dialyzers.
</P>
<P>
   All new dialyzers must now display a date of manufacture, and
the FDA is working with manufacturers to develop shelf-life
criteria for the equipment, Hutter said.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Women's Diet Patterns  </HEADLINE>
By TAMMY WEBBER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Women who eat a wide variety of healthy foods may
significantly lower their risk of dying from such things as cancer,
heart disease and stroke, researchers suggested today.
</P>
<P>
   The findings might sound familiar, but this is the first time
the health effects of overall eating patterns have been studied,
according to the report in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that a diet that includes plenty of
fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat meat and dairy
products reduces a woman's chances of dying -- up to 30 percent for
women who ate the healthiest diets compared with those with the
most unhealthy eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   Most previous studies have looked at the health effects of
specific nutrients, foods or dietary habits -- such as eating
low-fat foods -- but not at overall eating patterns, said Dr. Arthur
Schatzkin, chief of the National Cancer Institute's nutritional
epidemiology branch and one of the study's authors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's another way of following the standard advice, but may be
a strategy that makes it easier for people to adopt dietary
guidelines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on questionnaires completed between 1987 and
1989 by more than 42,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers then looked at 23 recommended foods and counted how
many times the women reported eating those foods at least once a
week, giving each woman a score based on the responses. The scores
were compared with death rates among those women 5{ to six years
after the survey was completed.
</P>
<P>
   The study found women's risk of dying decreased as the scores
went up. Those who ate the highest amount of recommended foods were
30 percent less likely to die than those who ate the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were trying to come up with a fairly simple and practical
approach to looking at overall diet in terms of diversity of food
and recommended food,'' Schatzkin said. ''It is nice that a simple
approach to changing the way you eat improves health and increases
longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   The study does not prove a healthy diet alone accounted for the
results, because people who eat the healthiest food are probably
also more likely to do other healthy things such as exercising and
avoiding smoking, said Schatzkin and Madelyn Fernstrom, an expert
in nutrition and obesity treatment who heads the weight management
center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the results suggest a simpler approach to
achieving good health.
</P>
<P>
   Fernstrom, who was not involved in the study, said people often
are too caught up in selecting foods for specific nutrients or fat
levels instead of simply eating a wide variety of healthy foods.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating on simply eating a variety of healthy food ''takes
the magic bullet approach of particular foods away.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Food is not medicine,'' she said. ''The whole diet counts.''

<HEADLINE> Mariners 8, Indians 5  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Jay Buhner and John Olerud homered as the Seattle
Mariners rallied from a four-run deficit to beat the Cleveland
Indians 8-5 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez had three RBIs in the first two innings as the
Indians picked up where they left off on Monday night when they won
6-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the second, Buhner hit a 407-foot shot into the
second deck in left field for a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the third, Olerud tied the score at 4 with a
405-foot homer to center off Charles Nagy (1-3).
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scored two runs in the fifth. After Mike Cameron
singled and was sacrificed to second, Stan Javier hit a ball over
center fielder Kenny Lofton's head for a triple. Lofton broke in
before he realized the ball was going over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez then followed with a single to score Javier with
the second run of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wilson doubled and Cameron singled in the sixth for
Seattle's seventh run.
</P>
<P>
   John Halama (2-0) gave up four runs and five hits and four walks
in five innings. Seattle's bullpen pitched four scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Ramirez and David Justice had RBI singles off
Halama. In the second, Ramirez hit a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar had an RBI single in the ninth off Kazuhiro
Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy allowed six runs, six hits and two walks in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mariners will start LHP Rob Ramsay in place of injured
RHP Freddy Garcia's place on Wednesday against the Indians. ... The
Mariners, who led the majors with 244 homers last season, have hit
28 in 18 games this season, including 15 in 11 games at Safeco
Field. ... Ramirez's double was his 419th career extra base hit,
tying him for 10th place with Andre Thornton on Cleveland's career
list. ... Lofton was 0-for-4 and is 3-for-25 in his last seven
games. ... Cameron was taken out of the game at the top of the
seventh after suffering a sprained left finger when he stole second
after his RBI single in the sixth. ... Olerud homered for the
second time in three games. He won Sunday's game against Kansas
City with a three-run homer in the ninth, an 8-5 victory for the
Mariners.

<HEADLINE> Study: SIDS Still Poses Problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Many babies are still being placed on their
stomachs at bedtime despite a years-long campaign aimed at having
infants sleep on their backs to reduce the risk of death,
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics began the ''Back to Sleep''
campaign in 1994 after research showed that infants placed on their
stomachs run the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort has yielded mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   The SIDS rate nationwide fell 38 percent during the first two
years of the campaign and the number of stomach-sleepers has
declined significantly.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1998, one-fifth of infants were still being placed on
their stomachs, according to a report in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are based on 1,000 telephone interviews with
parents and other caretakers nationwide conducted each year between
1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Back placement ''is increasing but has not reached desired
levels,'' wrote the researchers, led by SIDS specialist Marian
Willinger of the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that infants would sleep better on their stomachs or
would spit up and choke while on their backs were among the reasons
cited by caregivers for not following the advice.
</P>
<P>
   The number of SIDS deaths nationwide fell from 2,705 to an
estimated 2,529 in 1998, the latest figures available.

<HEADLINE> Amato Forms New Italian Government  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Premier Giuliano Amato had barely finished saying
how difficult it was putting together Italy's latest government
when the rehashed center-left coalition began fraying after one
minister refused a post.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, a respected treasury minister in the 18-month-long
government of Massimo D'Alema that collapsed last week, is expected
to put the government formed Tuesday evening to the required
confidence vote in Parliament by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 percent of the vote is required to win such a vote.
The Italian news agency AGI said Amato should be able to count on
320 votes in the 630-seat Chamber of Deputies. He should have a
wider edge in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left, squabbling since it came to power in 1996 under
Romano Prodi, set aside disputes in a bid to stay in power until
scheduled Parliamentary elections in spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the center-left's eagerness to stay in control, it was
tough going coming up with a Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ''All told, it wasn't easy,'' said Amato, whom President Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi asked on Friday to come up with a new government.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal of Edo Ronchi of the Greens to serve as minister for
European Union relations might not necessarily cost Amato votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens are likely to still back Amato since they have
another minister in the new coalition, but Ronchi was unhappy
because the new formation saw the Greens -- and himself -- lose the
environment ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left was trounced in April 16 regional elections by
forces backed by conservative opposition leader and media mogul
Silvio Berlusconi, and the coalition told D'Alema he had to go.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi, who was premier in 1994, criticized the new
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a formation which speaks for itself, put in place with
the sole purpose of keeping the left in power,'' said Berlusconi,
who had lobbied Ciampi to call elections a year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Amato's coalition ranges from former Communists to Communist
hard-liners to liberal former Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar faces include Lamberto Dini, a moderate who remains
foreign minister, and Vincenzo Visco, a member of the Democrat
Left, a former Communist party, who switches from finance minister
to treasury and budget minister.
</P>
<P>
   Many others kept their posts or switched departments.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a photocopy of the D'Alema government,'' said Berlusconi
ally Roberto Maroni of the autonomy-seeking Northern League.
</P>
<P>
   As Socialist premier in the early 1990s, Amato won a reputation
for courageously slashing away at Italy's huge budget deficit. His
government included several men who were later discredited by
kickback scandals, but Amato's integrity was never questioned.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Promises To Close Chernobyl  </HEADLINE>
By MARINA SYSOYEVA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERNOBYL, Ukraine (AP) -- For 14 years, Ukraine has coped with
the legacy of the world's worst nuclear disaster at Chernobyl -- and
the path to recovery is still long. Now the government is again
promising to shut the ill-fated plant, but refuses to give a date.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chernobyl will be closed down,'' Prime Minister Viktor
Yushchenko pledged Tuesday night, the eve of the accident's
anniversary. He spoke after laying a wreath at a memorial to
firefighters who were among the first to combat radioactive flames
from the disaster -- and among the first to die.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-dawn accident on April 26, 1986 sent a cloud that rained
radiation over much of Europe and contaminated large areas in
then-Soviet Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ukrainian government figures, more than 4,000 of
those who took part in the hasty and poorly organized Soviet
cleanup effort have died, and more than 70,000 Ukrainians were
fully disabled by the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about 3.4 million of Ukraine's 50 million people,
including about 1.26 million children, are considered affected by
Chernobyl. Of them, 400,000 adults and nearly 1.1 million children
are entitled to state aid for Chernobyl-linked health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the terrible legacy, Chernobyl's closure -- long
urged by Western nations and environmentalists the world over --
remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The plant now has just one working reactor, No. 3. The 1986
calamity ruined its reactor No. 4. Another of Chernobyl's RBMK
reactors has been inactive since a 1991 fire and a third was
stopped in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine had promised to fully close down Chernobyl by the end of
1999, but delayed the closure until an unspecified date this year,
saying it is too strapped for energy and needs financial aid to
build two new reactors as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pressure is mounting on Ukraine to give a definite
closure date for what many see as the embodiment of the evils of
the atomic era.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is essential to have a date fixed,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said during a visit to Kiev this month.
</P>
<P>
   Yushchenko, touring the plant 80 miles north of the capital, was
noncommittal Tuesday, saying only that the date might be released
by the summer meeting of international donors for Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of Seven richest nations promised aid in 1995 to help
Ukraine close Chernobyl, but Kiev complains the money has been slow
in coming. Yushchenko reiterated that, asking for more support.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the world's good political understanding of the
Chernobyl problem, Ukraine is left alone to deal with practical
liquidation of the danger that Chernobyl represents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government says Ukraine spent $5.7 billion to battle the
effects of the disaster during Soviet times and $5 billion since
independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Western money has helped Ukraine conduct
repairs on the leaky concrete and steel sarcophagus over the
exploded reactor, and workers have started to build a nuclear waste
storage facility.
</P>
<P>
   Still, much remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy declining badly since the Soviet collapse,
state funding covered only an average of 51.6 percent of Chernobyl
relief needs from 1996-98. Financial constraints forced the Cabinet
to actually finance just 85 percent of Chernobyl-linked social
programs in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 budget allocated only $290 million of at least $830
million needed a year for social and health programs to help
Chernobyl victims, Emergency Situations Minister Vasyl Durdynets
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the health of affected populace is steadily
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   The number of diseases among affected children is 17 percent
higher on average than among their ordinary counterparts, and the
incidence of some illnesses twice exceeds the norm.
</P>
<P>
   A Health Ministry report released last week said thyroid cancer
among Ukrainian children has risen dramatically since the accident.
About 1,400 people who were children or adolescents at the time of
the disaster have been operated on for thyroid cancer so far.
</P>
<P>
   Chernobyl-related troubles are not limited to health issues.
</P>
<P>
   The working reactor has suffered repeated shutdowns this winter
over failures at its safety valves. The government is far from
clear on what to do with about 6,000 plant workers and their
families once Chernobyl is closed. Vast areas of Ukraine remain
contaminated. Tons of nuclear fuel apparently are still inside the
sarcophagus.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Ukrainian people have performed a heroic deed during those
14 years as they fought to contain this tragedy,'' Yushchenko said.
''Ukraine must not be left alone.''

<HEADLINE> Congressional Republicans Outraged  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a familiar sight: Republicans in Congress
marching in near unison to express outrage over acts committed by
the Clinton administration, even as polls suggest the drumbeat may
not be heard by most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the subject is the pre-dawn weekend raid that
reunited Elian Gonzalez with his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that a majority of Americans approved of the tactics
and believe the 6-year-old shipwreck victim belongs with his
father. But that hasn't stopped Republicans from vowing full-court
election-year investigations into Attorney General Janet Reno's
decision to use force.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everyone knows the spin that the White House is going
to put on this. ... You know, there go the Republicans again,''
said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., poking fun at the inevitable
criticism even as he sought to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   Other times Republicans have lined up in such a fashion --
including the 1995-96 government shutdowns, the 1998 probes of
Democratic fund-raising practices and the 1998-99 impeachment
proceedings -- it largely backfired on them.
</P>
<P>
   Their poll numbers went down instead of up.
</P>
<P>
   ''The learning curve for the Republican majority in Congress is
flat,'' suggested University of Virginia political scientist Larry
Sabato. ''If the Republicans keep this up (on Elian Gonzalez), they
may turn this into an issue that works in favor of the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were divided earlier this year over whether to
bestow on Elian U.S. citizenship, or permanent residency, in an
effort to block his return to Cuba. That's why leaders were unable
to schedule vote on such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There clearly was division about the best way to proceed at
that particular time,'' conceded Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   But with the weekend raid, the target shifted to a more familiar
one -- Reno and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot more unity in feeling that the actions that were
taken were excessive, and the force that was used, the way this was
done at night,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken since Saturday's military-style raid show that a
majority of Americans feel the government had done all it could to
settle the impasse without resorting to force, and have little
interest in congressional hearings into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about such polls -- and the apparent support Reno enjoys --
Lott told reporters, ''I don't believe that the American people
approved of the kind of action they saw Saturday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's office, meanwhile, is bedecked with a growing number of
bouquets of flowers she has gotten from well wishers. When she
emerged from an elevator in the Capitol after discussing the raid
on Tuesday in a grueling 1 hour-45 minute session with Senate
leaders, many tourists in the area burst into spontaneous applause.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton -- not always a big fan -- praised her
warmly in a White House speech on Tuesday. He also praised the
federal agents who participated in the Miami raid for a ''very,
very difficult job to do with no easy choices.''
</P>
<P>
   But those same agents were denounced by House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, as ''jackbooted thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   And blunt-speaking Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who has conducted
several past investigations of alleged Clinton administration
misdeeds as chairman of the Government Reform Committee, asserted
that Americans ''shouldn't have to worry about federal agents
breaking down their door when there is no illegal activity going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the panel's senior
Democrat, to muse playfully that he hoped Burton would investigate
the Elian Gonzalez matter, too -- so congressional Democrats could
see their poll numbers rise again.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Andy Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the
People &AMP; the Press, said he sees little gain for Republicans in
continuing to pursue the Elian Gonzalez matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public hasn't liked the politics of the Elian Gonzalez
case, in the sense of political motives getting involved with what
happens to this young boy,'' Kohut said. ''I can't image that
further political charges against the administration are going to
be very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mack, one of the most outspoken Senate critics of
administration's actions, tries to be philosophical about the
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key issue now is where do we go from here?'' the Florida
Republican asked. ''History is history. Historians will write it
and legislators will investigate it. But we can't change it.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Asked To Open Nuke Facilities  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Mideast countries denounced Israel's
efforts to conceal its suspected nuclear arsenal and demanded it
join 187 other countries in allowing international scrutiny of its
nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt led the charge Tuesday at a conference reviewing progress
and failures of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying
Israel's secrecy threatened security in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Western intelligence reports say Israel has a significant
nuclear stockpile, making it the only nuclear power in the Middle
East. Israel has maintained a policy of ''nuclear opacity'' -- a
refusal to confirm or deny the possession of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's U.N. ambassador, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, urged delegates to
single out Israel for its failure to commit to the treaty -- the
only country in the region that hasn't done so.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message must be crystal clear in expressing the danger to
the security of the Middle East inherent in the continuation of the
status quo,'' Gheit said.
</P>
<P>
   He was backed by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and the
ambassadors from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in
demanding Israel agree to the treaty's terms and reveal its
arsenal. Other countries made similar demands -- but the Middle East
states were the most vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's U.N. ambassador, Mikhail Wehbe, is likely to echo the
sentiment when he addresses the conference today.
</P>
<P>
   The nonproliferation treaty, which went into force in 1970,
calls for nuclear weapons states to move toward disarmament and
bars countries without nuclear arsenals from obtaining or
developing them.
</P>
<P>
   It requires its signatories to allow the International Atomic
Energy Agency to verify that their nuclear technologies are being
used for peaceful means -- not weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, told Israel army
radio Tuesday that the country's policy would remain. ''We are not
saying what we have or don't have, and the deterrence stems from
the fact that others are kept guessing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia's ambassador, Fawzi Shobokshi, denounced the
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel's position and all its justifications clearly
contradict its calls for peace because true peace must be founded
on trust and good intentions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States generally backs Israel, which is isolated and
often criticized at the United Nations. It has tried to steer
criticism from Israel's suspected nuclear arsenal while it works on
peacemaking in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States has agreed for the first time to allow the
conference to create a subsidiary committee to deal with regional
nuclear issues, including the Middle East, said Daniel Plesch,
director of the British American Security Information Council,
which is monitoring progress of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. found it indefensible to not discuss Israel when it
has India and Pakistan to talk about,'' said Plesch, referring to
the nuclear weapons tests the two countries conducted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear, however, if the United States would back calls
by Mideast states to single Israel out by name in a resolution
calling for a nuclear weapon-free zone in the Middle East. At the
last review conference in 1995, a resolution adopted made no
specific reference of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had some discussions on this subject. We have had some
elements of understanding, but there's still more to be done,''
said John Holum, a senior U.S. adviser on arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Only four countries -- Israel, India, Pakistan and Cuba -- haven't
signed the nonproliferation treaty.

<HEADLINE> Court Hears Gay Scout Leaders Case  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court is confronting emotional
issues of free speech and homosexuality in deciding whether the Boy
Scouts can bar gays from serving as troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing arguments today, the last day of oral arguments in
the current term, the justices will decide by July whether the
Scouts had a constitutional right to oust a troop leader after
learning he is homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's highest court ruled that the Boy Scouts' ban on gay
troop leaders violated a state ban on discrimination in public
accommodations. But the Scouts say the state law violates the
organization's rights of free speech and free association under the
Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case involves constitutional rights at the heart of our
free society: the freedom of a private, voluntary, noncommercial
organization to create and interpret its own moral code, and to
choose leaders and define membership criteria accordingly,'' the
Scouts' lawyers said in a court brief.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts require members to promise to be ''clean'' and
''morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for James Dale, a New Jersey Eagle Scout whose role
as assistant scoutmaster was revoked after the organization learned
he was gay, argue that allowing openly gay Scout leaders will not
harm the organization's teaching of family values.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dale can continue to teach the affirmative character traits
central to scouting,'' his lawyers said in court papers.
''Scoutmasters indeed lead by example during troop meetings,
camping trips ... but no scouting context calls upon them to 'role
model' sexuality, marriage or intimate adult relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale was 20 and an assistant scoutmaster of a Matawan, N.J.,
troop when in 1990 he was identified in a newspaper article as
co-president of a campus lesbian and gay student group at Rutgers
University.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts' Monmouth Council revoked Dale's registration as an
adult leader, telling him the organization does not allow openly
gay members.
</P>
<P>
   Dale sued, contending the Scouts violated the New Jersey Law
Against Discrimination. The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled for
Dale, saying his expulsion was ''based on little more than
prejudice and not on a unified Boy Scout position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts' Supreme Court appeal relies on a 1995 decision
in which the justices let the private sponsor of Boston's St.
Patrick's Day Parade exclude a group of gays and lesbians. Parades
are a ''form of expression'' and private sponsors cannot be forced
to include a group promoting a message the sponsors oppose, the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   Dale's lawyers point to Supreme Court decisions during the 1980s
dealing with state public accommodations laws, in which the
justices said states may force the Jaycees and Rotary International
to admit women as full members.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the court let New York City bar clubs with more than 400
members from discriminating against women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has dealt with gay rights infrequently. In
1996, the justices struck down a Colorado measure that barred
ordinances giving gays legal protection from discrimination, such
as in housing or employment. But the court also has repeatedly
turned away challenges to President Clinton's ''don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Boy Scouts of America vs. Dale, 99-699.

<HEADLINE> Former Black Panther Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Black Panther leader Elmer
''Geronimo'' Pratt has settled his false imprisonment and civil
rights lawsuit against the FBI and city of Los Angeles for $4.5
million, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, 53, spent 25 years in prison until his murder conviction
was overturned in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a fair deal for everybody,'' said Johnnie Cochran Jr.,
the attorney who represented Pratt at his 1972 trial and the 1997
hearing where his conviction was reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has reportedly agreed to pay $1.75
million. The Times, citing unidentified sources, said the city's
share of the settlement is $2.75 million, which must be approved by
the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, maintained his innocence
from the start. He lives in his hometown of Morgan City, La., where
he uses the name Geronimo ji Jaga and is working to convert the
abandoned, once-segregated school he attended into a youth center.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1972 trial, Pratt was convicted of robbing and fatally
shooting schoolteacher Caroline Olsen on a Santa Monica tennis
court.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was in Oakland for Black Panther meetings the day of
the murder, and that FBI agents and police hid and possibly
destroyed wiretap evidence that would prove that.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt's lawyers blamed his arrest on a politically charged
campaign by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI against the Black Panthers and
other perceived enemies of the U.S. government. His legal team
waged a relentless campaign to free Pratt, winning numerous
hearings only to then be rebuffed repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Everett Dickey finally granted Pratt a new
trial in 1997, saying the credibility of prosecution witness Julius
Butler -- who testified that Pratt had confessed to him -- could have
been undermined if the jury had known Butler was an ex-felon and
police informant.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt was freed. Two years later, District Attorney Gil Garcetti
announced he would not bring him to trial again after failing to
persuade an appeals court to reinstate the conviction.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Media: Reunion Photos Legit  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Hoping to buttress their case that Elian Gonzalez
belongs with his father, Cuban officials have described the child
romping with dogs and playing with his little brother while in
seclusion with his father and stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boy was loving, above all with his father and little
brother,'' said the report from the Cuban Interests Section in
Washington read Tuesday night over Cuban state television.
</P>
<P>
   ''On several occasions he carried Hianny (his brother) and put
him down, repeating with affection, 'I love you very much','' said
the report by Cuban diplomats who were with the family Sunday and
Monday at Andrews Air Force Base in the Maryland suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   After three days at Andrews, the family was moved on Tuesday to
the Wye River conference center in Maryland in an effort to shield
them from the sort of intense media attention focused on Elian
during his stay with his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro was in the audience but did not
speak during the 2{-hour broadcast dedicated to the boy at the
center of a custody battle since being rescued in late November
after a shipwreck that killed his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The Interests Section report portrayed Elian as a happy child
playing soccer and dominoes with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
and playing with dogs at a grassy area of the base.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several people at the base brought gifts for Elian and Hianny
for Easter,'' it said, and praised law enforcement officials
guarding the family for ''their position of cooperation and great
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban psychologist Patricia Ares said the Interests Section
report, along with photos released earlier of a smiling Elian
hugging his father, removed any doubt that ''there exists an
intense bond'' between the boy and his father ''that never was
interrupted,'' despite five months in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The program also showed clips of a U.S. television broadcast in
which psychiatrists discussed the emotional stability of
Marisleysis Gonzalez, who had cared for the boy in Miami and who
had been hospitalized several times for stress.
</P>
<P>
   Ares said the young woman was ''disturbed'' and claimed she
could cause emotional harm to Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials have strongly supported the U.S. government's
raid Saturday that removed Elian from the house of Lazaro Gonzalez,
who is fighting to keep the child in the United States against his
father's expressed wish to return the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in Atlanta has ordered the boy kept in
the United States until the Miami family's attempt to win political
asylum for him is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday night program quoted journalists in Miami as saying
a strike there Tuesday to protest the raid had failed to shut down
the city. One called it a ''management lockout'' by Cuban-American
businessmen. Program moderator Randy Alonso termed the strike ''a
farce.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives had balked at giving the father unrestricted
custody of the child despite an Immigration and Naturalization
Service order stripping them of custody.
</P>
<P>
   The program was one of scores that Cuban television has
broadcast over the past four months, in addition to mass rallies
organized by the Communist youth organizations to demand Elian's
return.
</P>
<P>
   The television on Tuesday night repeated a call to make the
traditional May Day celebrations a massive rally for Elian's
return.

<HEADLINE> U.S. OKs Visit by Elian's Playmates  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER THORNE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEENSTOWN, Md. (AP) -- He still can't go home, so little pieces
of Elian Gonzalez's life in Cuba are being brought to him in
America as his family, the courts and the U.S. Senate consider the
6-year-old's fate.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest stop on his five-month odyssey, the young boat
wreck survivor was moved to a secluded and wooded Maryland retreat
where there's lots of room to play. There, he awaits visits by his
former kindergarten teacher and a 10-year-old cousin, perhaps as
early as today.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an understanding that he's going to be here for quite
some time,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin -- also
announcing visas would be expedited for four of Elian's playmates
to come from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''A young 6-year-old ... needs to have someone to play with.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that at the request of Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, four friends of Elian will be allowed visas to visit him
for about two weeks. Each will be accompanied by one adult family
member.
</P>
<P>
   Visas for the former teacher and a cousin who Elian is said to
be very close to had been approved nearly a month ago but not used.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, a supporter of the family, said
the visits are important to create ''a sense of normalcy for him
about the life he has lead and will lead.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably as close as we can do, given the fact that
normal for him would be to be back in his own town, in his own
home, own bed, own school, own neighborhood,'' she said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. marshals on Tuesday moved Elian, his father, stepmother and
half brother from housing at Andrews Air Force Base, outside
Washington, D.C., where they had stayed since Saturday. They moved
about 70 miles east of Washington to a house on the 1,100-acre
Aspen Institute's Wye River estate known as the site of seminars,
Mideast peace talks and retreats.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time Tuesday, Attorney General Janet Reno met
with a group of senators at the Capitol to defend her decision to
send armed agents to seize the boy early Saturday from the home of
Miami relatives who've been trying for five months to permanently
keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Miami relatives, who came to Washington hours after
the boy was seized, made their fourth unsuccessful attempt in as
many days to visit Elian. They were turned from the gate of the air
force base at about the same time the family was being moved to
Wye.
</P>
<P>
   And Justice officials were awaiting word from a doctor who had
scheduled a meeting with the father to assess when might be the
best time for Elian to see the Miami relatives again.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Justice Department official, speaking on condition of
not being identified, said, at Reno's request, one of the three
doctors who previously interviewed Juan Miguel Gonzalez and Lazaro
Gonzalez -- Dr. Paulina F. Kernberg, a professor of psychiatry at
Cornell University Medical College -- interviewed the father again
and Elian for 2{ hours Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor also was to assess whether and how the Florida
relatives might visit Elian, but did not immediately make a
recommendation, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed-door meeting lasting about 1 hour and 45 minutes,
Reno told 13 senators that the possibility that there were firearms
in the house of Elian's Florida relatives was a key consideration
for the military-style raid, participants said.
</P>
<P>
   They apparently were dissatisfied with the explanation. While
several Democrats praised her performance, Republican senators
emerged from the session with fresh criticism of Reno and the
pre-dawn raid in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of the questions were not adequately answered,'' said
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who had arranged the
session.
</P>
<P>
   Lott announced hearings into the raid next week by the Senate
Judiciary Committee -- and suggested that Elian's father would be
among those sought for testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''This use of force was totally unnecessary,'' said Sen. Connie
Mack, R-Fla., after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., an opponent of the raid, accused
Clinton of breaking a personal promise that Elian would not be
seized at night. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, asked about
such a promise on NBC's ''Today Show,'' denied that the president
made such a commitment. But Graham retorted: ''Joe Lockhart was not
in the room when the statement was made.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, one of
only three senators invited by Lott to the session who supported
the administration's handling of the case, told reporters
afterward, ''they chose to show force so they wouldn't have to use
force.'' He said, however, that he would not oppose hearings.
</P>
<P>
   With the drama now moved squarely to the Washington area,
Cuban-Americans in Miami upset over Elian's seizure called a
general strike. Workers stayed home, students skipped school and
businesses closed, bringing honking cars and Cuban flags to the
streets of Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Miami family filed a motion Tuesday in the
11th Circuit Court of Appeals, asking that a guardian be appointed
who could check on Elian's well-being and make sure he stays in the
country -- at least until his asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The court directed attorneys for Juan Miguel Gonzalez to file a
response by this afternoon, stating any reasons why this shouldn't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami family, said they
hoped this could clear the way for the family's attorneys -- and
even the family -- to see Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the whole thing; they would love to see the little
boy,'' Gutierrez said. ''We're concerned about how Elian is
doing.''

<HEADLINE> Bush To Help GOP Raise $18 Million  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has broken all fund-raising
records as a presidential candidate and will now help the
Republican National Committee set a new dollar mark of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Having raised more than $80 million for his White House bid,
Bush is headlining tonight's RNC black-tie gala, which will bring
in a record $18 million for the party in one night.
</P>
<P>
   The previous fund-raising record for a political party in a
single evening was the $14 million raised last year when Bush's
father, the former president, headlined the same dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's guest list reads like a Who's Who of business
interests before the government.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, the National Rifle Association, tobacco giant Philip
Morris, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and United
Parcel Service are among the companies and groups whose officials
will attend a private reception and then dine with the presumptive
presidential nominee and GOP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 38 companies or individuals raised or donated at least a
quarter million dollars for the extravaganza, and an additional 16
shelled out at least $100,000, according to a donor list obtained
by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the list was evidence that the Texas governor
will side with corporate special interests if elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've known for the last few months that Bush is on his Bob
Jones redemption tour, but now we know who the sponsors are: the
tobacco industry, HMOs and insurance companies, and the gun
lobby,'' Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Jenny Backus
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer noted that Democrats returned
millions of dollars in donations after the 1996 elections amid
allegations that they came from foreign sources, which is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democratic National Committee has returned more illegal
money than most Republicans raise in any one year, so it's rather
odd for them to launch fund-raising criticisms,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   And Republican officials noted that donations to the party
average $55. Democratic Party officials have declined to specify
their average contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Before attending the dinner, Bush, whose foreign policy
credentials have been questioned by critics, was to meet with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, in town to see President
Clinton and other U.S. officials. Bush and his wife Laura also were
to be the keynote speakers on a lunchtime panel at a conference of
Republican women leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC, meanwhile, is holding its own fund-raiser next month,
trading tuxedos and gowns for blue jeans and barbecue at a
Washington arena. Organizers expect to raise at least $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   That same night, May 24, congressional Republicans are having
their annual House-Senate dinner that will raise at least $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's RNC dinner features the leaders of the
Republican-controlled Congress, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
of Mississippi and House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But the main attraction is Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a nominee now and everybody's excited about him and
putting a Republican back in the White House and restoring dignity
and integrity and trust in the White House,'' party chairman Jim
Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP gala includes several of the fund-raisers who helped the
Texas governor amass a record $80 million for his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the chairman, Sam Fox, heads a Missouri investment
company and raised at least $100,000 for Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And one co-chairman, who raised or contributed at least
$250,000, is Kenneth Lay, head of the Texas-based energy giant
Enron Corp. Enron has been the biggest financial contributor of
Bush's political career, giving more than $500,000, according to
the watchdog Center for Public Integrity. Lay also has raised more
than $100,000 for Bush's presidential campaign.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes Nuclear Waste Bill  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators are trying to round up votes to
override or defend President Clinton's veto of legislation that
would have allowed thousands of tons of highly radioactive nuclear
waste to be shipped to Yucca Mountain in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., the assistant minority whip, said he
has the votes to block an override. Republicans say the narrow
margin could be tipped in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very close,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada lawmakers and national environmental groups hailed the
veto Tuesday, which blocked transportation of 40,000 tons of the
lethal material that has piled up at commercial reactors in 31
states. Ultimately, more than 77,000 metric tons would have been
stored at the site 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation that the Republican majority in Congress has
been trying to force down the throats of the American people not
only jeopardizes the health and safety of every Nevadan, but puts
millions of other Americans at risk,'' said Sen. Richard Bryan,
D-Nev.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, who heads the Energy and
Resources Committee, blasted the president for leaving unresolved
where the country will permanently store the waste that remains
lethal for 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is wrong for the environment, it is wrong for our energy
policy, it is wrong for the economy, and it is wrong for national
security,'' Murkowski said of the veto. ''It is irresponsible to
let this situation continue; it is a crime against our future.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other supporters of the legislation vowed to try to
override the veto, beginning in the Senate. The vote won't be easy
for either side. The difference is so close, the vote probably
won't occur this week because two Republicans are traveling, Craig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the House nor Senate approved the measure by the
two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. The House approved
it 252-167 and the Senate 64-34.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said if the override efforts failed, federal officials
would have to work with states to decide how to store the
accumulating waste from plants that generate 21 percent of the
country's power.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had promised to veto the bill, but his accompanying
message didn't criticize the Yucca Mountain site. He instead
criticized the bill for postponing the Environmental Protection
Agency's authority to set radiation standards at the site for a
year, until June 2001, which would delay the Energy Department's
recommendation about the site's suitability.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson deflected questions about where
the administration would store the waste without a central
repository. The administration will focus first on sustaining the
veto, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would have required shipments of used nuclear
fuel begin to be shipped to Nevada in 2007, once the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission approves a license for a permanent waste site
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC is expected to decide as early as 2006 on whether the
Yucca Mountain underground nuclear waste repository 90 miles
northwest of Las Vegas should be licensed. Now under scientific
review, the site is proposed for opening in 2010.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Tapping a prominent figure from his father's
administration, George W. Bush selected former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on
Tuesday to head his vice presidential selection team. ''I trust Dick Cheney's
judgment; I know his character,'' Bush said. ''It's obviously an important
decision for me and I can't think of a better person to work with on making that
decision.'' Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said he
hasn't made any list of potential prospects and Cheney's service as chairman
would not disqualify him from being selected himself.

   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Shaking hands with crowds of Vietnamese, a nostalgic
John McCain returned Tuesday to the Hanoi lake where in 1967 he was dragged
ashore and beaten after parachuting from his downed warplane. The bitter war has
yielded to reconciliation, and the Arizona senator strolled with his family
around the busy shorefront of the capital's Truc Bach lake, stopping at a
sidewalk memorial marking his rescue. ''I put the Vietnam War behind me a long
time ago,'' McCain said upon arriving in Vietnam today. ''I harbor no anger, no
rancor.''

<HEADLINE> Jury deliberates after prosecutor calls McDermott 'stud stockpicker'  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A prosecutor suggested that a Wall Street
executive who earned $4 million annually was doing the ''macho
thing'' when he fed secrets about bank stocks to an X-rated movie
actress.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Young Oh said James McDermott Jr.
was trying to impress Kathryn Gannon with his stock picking prowess
when he tipped the actress about six companies involved in deals
that would catapult the value of their stock.
</P>
<P>
   During closing arguments, Oh told jurors it was absurd to think
McDermott, the former chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods, gave Gannon $150,000 with which to buy stocks and did not
tell her what to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you think that's how it really happened?'' Oh asked. ''Come
on. She was the actress, dancer and model. He was the stud stock
picker.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan began deliberations
in the case Tuesday but retired after two hours without reaching a
verdict. Deliberations were to continue this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Oh rejected arguments by defense lawyers that McDermott never
gave Gannon inside information regarding banks about to announce
mergers because his $4 million annual salary meant he could just
give her cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence has shown that giving cash to Gannon was not
enough,'' Oh said. ''There was something more to this scheme than
just the money. Maybe McDermott was trying to impress her. This is
a way for him to show her what he did. Maybe it was a macho
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor was not permitted by Judge Kimba Wood to tell
jurors that Gannon danced naked or performed under the name Marylin
Star in movies such as ''Pumped,'' ''Shades of Blonde,'' ''Sins of
the Flesh'' and ''S.M.U.T. 4.''
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, lawyer Denis McInerney had called his client a
''rocket scientist on bank stocks'' who recommended winning stocks
to Gannon long before they were put on lists requiring nothing be
said about them until mergers were announced.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor, is charged with conspiracy
and securities fraud in the case along with co-defendant Anthony
Pomponio, 45, of North Caldwell, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Pomponio allegedly traded illegally after he was told the inside
information by Gannon, with whom he also was having an affair.
Gannon, who used to live in Miami, is a fugitive believed to be in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the prosecutor, told jurors that McDermott recommended
stocks to ''his lover, Gannon,'' who in turn recommended the stock
to ''her other lover, Pomponio.'' Gannon, 30, and Pomponio
allegedly made $170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   Oh said the argument that McDermott ''was too rich or made too
much money to commit this crime is silly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We already know he was willing to risk his marriage and his
job for this affair with Kathryn Gannon,'' Oh said.

<HEADLINE> NU's first-quarter profits soar with restart of Millstone 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN, Conn. (AP) -- The restart of Millstone 2 nuclear power
plant helped Northeast Utilities first-quarter net earnings soar to
$74.6 million, a 304 percent increase from $18.4 million in the
same period last year, the company reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest difference is that Millstone 2 ran. It was not
running at all in the first quarter in 1999,'' NU spokesman Jeffrey
Kotkin said Tuesday. ''There was a huge cost that we were incurring
while our nuclear plants were off-line.''
</P>
<P>
   NU stock was up 55 cents per share, compared to 14 cents a share
in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12 months ending March 31, 2000, NU earned $90.4
million, or 68 cents a share, compared with a loss of $110.4
million, or 84 cents a share, for the 12 months ending March 31,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   All three Millstone reactors at the Waterford complex were shut
down in 1996 due to safety concerns. In the past year, Millstone 2
and 3 gained federal approval to restart. Millstone 1, the oldest
of the three, is being decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
   Nonfuel operation and maintenance costs at Millstone fell to
$256 million in the first three months of 2000, compared with $281
million during the same period of 1999, said Michael G. Morris,
NU's Chairman, president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said NU also benefited from continued economic expansion
in the region. Despite a mild winter, first-quarter retail sales
were up 3.3 percent
</P>
<P>
   The first-quarter results also reflect NU's March 1 merger with
Yankee Energy System, Inc. and the issuance of approximately 11.1
million NU shares to former Yankee shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   NU's total revenues rose by 32.5 percent to $1.38 billion,
compared with $1.04 billion in the first quarter of 1999. The
growth was due primarily to rapid expansion of Select Energy Inc.,
NU's energy marketing subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin-based Northeast Utilities is New England's largest
electric utility system, serving more than 2.3 million customers in
Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> Governor expected to sign sheriff reform bill  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The legislative effort to strip the
county sheriffs of power has been something of a crusade for state
Sen. George Gunther.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Republican lawmaker from Stratford has been trying to
abolish the system for the past three decades, blasting it as rife
with patronage and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh yea, oh yea, oh yea,'' Gunther said while casting his vote
Tuesday to put the sheriffs out of work and convert their deputies
to marshals who would answer to the state's Judicial Department.
The bill passed unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   The House OK'd the bill last week, and Gov. John G. Rowland --
who started trying to run the sheriffs out of the state
constitution last year -- is expected to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   But Gunther had some criticism for the bill, which lacks
language that would prevent the county sheriffs from ever working
as marshals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hate like hell to see the admirals and generals go
back into the system,'' Gunther said.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms would go into effect Dec. 1, but are contingent on
voter approval in November of a constitutional amendment to abolish
the office of high sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Several scandals have shaken the system in the past year, and
two county sheriffs have pleaded innocent to criminal charges. The
system is under investigation by state and federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The faults of this system have come from the top, not the
people at the bottom doing their jobs,'' said Senate President Pro
Tempore Kevin Sullivan, D-West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Under the reform bill, special deputies who now guard
courthouses and transport prisoners would be grandfathered into a
new system as judicial marshals. The deputies who now serve legal
papers such as subpoenas and summonses would be called state
marshals and work for the state as private contractors.
</P>
<P>
   All marshals would maintain their powers of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriffs would be allowed to serve the remainder of their
terms, which expire in 2003. But Rowland has threatened to reduce
their salaries, which are determined as budget line items, to $1.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans argued that the reforms should go into effect
before the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of waiting for the results of a referendum, we could
transfer (the special deputies) in October,'' said Sen. Thomas
Upson, R-Waterbury. ''Why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have said they believe the sheriffs will bully
their deputies into working against the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill prohibits sheriffs from raising money from their
employees and pressuring them to campaign against the
constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sheriffs are a very hot political group to deal with,''
Gunther said.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators said they will promote the ballot issue during
their re-election campaigns this year.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms would cost the state as much as $3.6 million,
according to the non-partisan Office of Fiscal Analysis.

<HEADLINE> Financial adviser to stars accused of living off the backs of hisclients  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An indictment against a financial adviser to
some of Hollywood's young stars accused him of spending their money
on helicopters, hotels, limousines and even the rent for his SoHo
loft.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of ornaments to travel in a world that included clients
such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Stiller and Courtney Cox Arquette
caused Dana C. Giacchetto to reach into his clients' accounts and
grab at least $9 million, prosecutors contend in the indictment
returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto, 37, allegedly misappropriated the money through
Cassandra, a company he ran from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment in U.S. District Court in Manhattan accuses
Giacchetto of taking the money to benefit himself, his company,
third parties to which he lent money or to pay other clients and
conceal the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, Giacchetto allegedly spent at least
$8,000 on helicopters, $3,400 on limousines, $12,000 to lease a new
Mercedes-Benz and more than $30,000 on stereos, computers, art and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   He allegedly rang up more than $120,000 on hotel bills,
including one stint at a Hollywood hotel that cost more than
$80,000 for 10 suites, the indictment said. Restaurant bills added
another $55,000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he gave millions of dollars belonging to his clients
to friends and associates, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   The comforts allegedly supported his ability to flash the pearls
of success at Hollywood parties where he could pad a client list so
valuable that, after his arrest, he announced through his lawyer
that he wanted to become an agent.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said Giacchetto promised clients he used a
conservative investment strategy and did not take custody of their
money when he actually was looting the accounts of at least $9
million.
</P>
<P>
   When federal authorities noticed, he allegedly lied to them and
altered a crucial portion of a Cassandra balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The altered portion of the balance sheet falsely represented
that the company had no liabilities and net capital of more than $1
million when it actually had more than $9.3 million in liabilities
and was insolvent by more than $2.2 million, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accused him of failing to disclose that he owed
$4.8 million to the band Phish.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto surrendered and was released on bail last month.
Later, he was ordered held without bail after prosecutors said he
was caught at an airport with an expired passport, a bag of cash
and $44,000 in airplane tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charged that he bought airline tickets to Italy,
Japan, Singapore and Germany and had altered an expired passport to
make it appear as though it were still valid.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Giacchetto faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in
prison and a fine of up to $18 million on a securities fraud count.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Levander, Giacchetto's lawyer, did not return a telephone
message for comment.

<HEADLINE> Gorbachev says Putin lacks experience but works hard  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev may
have pulled for another candidate to win the Russian presidency,
but he says the nation must now rally behind Vladimir Putin and
help him continue the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, who supported former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
says Putin ''will be a serious partner who understands the
importance of the West, the importance of Europe and the importance
particularly of the United States for Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov eventually dropped out of the election won by Putin, a
former KGB agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin is a new man in Russian politics,'' said Gorbachev, who
was a panelist at a forum assembled by media magnate Rupert Murdoch
on Tuesday. ''He doesn't have enough experience of statesmanship.
At the same time he is a serious and well-educated person. He is a
very hardworking person.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who never held elected office until last month's
presidential vote, is viewed with some concern in the West because
of his hard-line positions on the war in Chechnya and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, who led the Soviet Union from 1985 until its 1991
collapse, made the remarks in a question-and-answer session with
reporters after participating in a panel discussion of global
expectations of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists included Koichi Kato, a former secretary general
of Japan's Liberal-Democratic Party, and World Bank President James
Wolfensohn, who said the developing world expects the United States
to be an equal partner.
</P>
<P>
   A second panel comprised four U.S. political leaders: former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich; Sen. Bob Kerrey, of Nebraska; former
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Gen. Colin Powell, former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Both panels were moderated by former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger and ranged widely over issues having to do with the role
of the United States in a post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said that while the United States must change its
foreign policy style and learn ''to listen better, to be a partner
rather than a dominator,'' the nation's main challenges in the next
25 years are domestic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not prepared for another wave of technological and
scientific change,'' Gingrich said. ''We ought to go to a model
where every 4-year-old gets a computer with a literacy package.
That may sound radical. In 1800 free education was radical. In 1900
free textbooks were radical in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich called education reform ''the No. 1 challenge to
American leadership in the 21st century'' and said the National
Science Foundation's annual budget should be increased from $4
billion to $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The event, titled Global Forum 2000, took place at a Wall Street
hotel in front of an invited audience of about 250 that included
former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton,
Republican fund-raiser Georgette Mosbacher and gossip columnist
Cindy Adams.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of demonstrators outside protested the absence of
women on either panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge oversight,'' said Sonia Ossorio, media director
for the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was the keynote speaker at
a dinner Monday night kicking off the forum, a spokesman for
Murdoch's News Corp. noted.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Criticize Bush Health Plans  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Republicans ''have blood in their eyes,'' Vice
President Al Gore warned as he tried to keep pace with GOP fund
raising and rolled out an all-points critique of the policy agenda
of Republican presidential rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the governor of Texas, should be embarrassed that
uninsured Texans cross the border into Mexico to seek health care,
Gore said at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser Tuesday
night, winding up for his all-out slam of Bush's health proposals
today at a Hartford, Conn., senior center.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to take little vouchers that are a tiny part of what
works in the private market and pretend that it's more than enough
when it's hardly a down payment,'' Gore told about 130 contributors
at the $5,000-per-plate salmon dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know about you but I think it's embarrassing that in
one of our states, people who need health care and can't get it in
the United States of America have to go across the border to Mexico
to get their health care. It happens every day in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer, saying Gore's
''credibility'' was shining through, countered that Bush's proposed
health reforms would instead help as many as 18 million low-income
Americans gain health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, ''fails to explain why, since he was
elected, there are 8 million more Americans without health
insurance than when he took office. And he continues his campaign
of exaggeration, misrepresentation and distortion,'' Fleischer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC fund-raiser came on the eve of tonight's Republican
National Committee gala in Washington, which Bush will headline and
help the party collect a record $18 million in one night.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other side,'' Gore warned, was braced ''to throw
everything including the kitchen sink into this and they've got
blood in their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Ohio, which is closely watched by candidates and
political parties because of its record of going for the winner in
the November election, Bush led Gore by 9 points, 52 percent to 41
percent in a new Ohio Poll released today.
</P>
<P>
   When third-party candidates Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader are
included, Bush's lead drops to 47 percent to Gore's 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 521 voters by the University of Cincinnati
was taken April 5 through Saturday and has an error margin of plus
or minus 4.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Italian Gondola Tragedy Settled  </HEADLINE>
By JOE WHEELAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- More than two years after a Marine jet
severed an Italian ski gondola cable, killing 20 Europeans, the
victims' relatives will get nearly $40 million from the U.S. and
Italian governments.
</P>
<P>
   A Virginia attorney representing the Belgian relatives of five
of the victims of the Feb. 3, 1998, tragedy near Cavalese, Italy,
said the settlement accepted by the families April 14 was a
bittersweet end to their quest for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sad part is that this is what the United States should
have done two years ago,'' C. Torrence Armstrong of McLean, Va.,
said in a telephone interview Tuesday. ''In taking this long, it's
not a very satisfying feeling for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Each victim's family will get nearly $2 million. The U.S.
government will pay 75 percent of the settlement's cost, and the
Italian government will pay the rest, Armstrong said. The
settlement ratio is governed by NATO accords.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems this is all the U.S. is going to do,'' he said,
adding that the U.S. Navy hasn't kept its promise to give the
families a report about the safety of military flights over Italy.
''They reneged on that and never provided it,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach the Pentagon for comment Tuesday were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government is continuing to investigate the
accident, but the settlement ends all civil litigation, Armstrong
said.
</P>
<P>
   An EA-6B Prowler based at Cherry Point Marine Air Base was
deployed at Aviano Air Base in Italy for missions over Bosnia when
it clipped the ski gondola cable during a training flight. All 20
people in the gondola died when it plummeted into an alpine valley.
The damaged jet made it back to base.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators blamed the flight crew for the tragedy, saying the
plane was flying too low and too fast when it hit the cable.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Capt. Richard J. Ashby, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was
acquitted of manslaughter but sentenced to six months in the brig
for destroying a videotape shot during the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Prowler's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer of Westbury,
N.Y., was dismissed from the Marines after pleading guilty to a
similar charge for the videotape's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Charges were dropped against the two back-seat crewmen.

<HEADLINE> Shell Fined $2M in Tanker Case  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is warning oil shippers in the
Persian Gulf that they must be able to prove that cargo found to
include Iraqi oil was not obtained in violation of the U.N. oil
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Tuesday that oil giant
Royal Dutch-Shell Group was fined $2 million last weekend for
failing to document its claim that Iraqi oil aboard a tanker it
hired in the Persian Gulf was not bought in violation of the
embargo. The oil company will be allowed to keep the oil, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Bacon said, failure to document the legality of
Iraqi oil shipments will result in confiscation of the cargo and
possibly the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said chemical tests of the cargo aboard the Russian tanker
Akademik Pustovoit, detained April 5 with a cargo of 78,000 tons of
Royal-Dutch Shell oil, showed that 20 percent was of Iraqi origin.
Bacon said he believed the rest of the oil was from Iranian fields.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the tanker was stopped, Royal Dutch-Shell officials
insisted its cargo was exclusively Iranian.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Royal Dutch-Shell unwittingly acquired the Iraqi
portion of its cargo, although the circumstances are unclear. As a
result, the oil company was fined but allowed to keep the cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Royal Dutch-Shell cooperated fully with the

<HEADLINE> Mexico Police Harassed US Tourists  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIA PARRA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP)-- Two rogue federal police agents assigned
to the international airport in the Pacific coast resort of
Acapulco have allegedly harassed U.S. tourists several times over
the last month, the airport's director said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement Tuesday by airport director Carlos Morlet appears
to lend weight to a complaint by a Los Angeles resident, who told
The Associated Press that federal agents stole $300 from him after
he was held in an airport interrogation room.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have detected two Federal Judicial Police agents assigned
to the airport for more than a month who have carried out actions
against tourists from the United States,'' Morlet said.
</P>
<P>
   Morlet said the three recent cases of harassment were apparently
directed against Mexicans with U.S. residency who came to Acapulco
on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police have abused our countrymen, and it has reached such
extremes that we are taking measures to prevent more abuses,''
Morlet said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Angel Santos of Los Angeles claimed that two federal
police agents at the airport detained him as he arrived in
Acapulco, held him in an interrogation room for an hour, suggested
he give them a bribe and took $300.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Santos claimed, was that his traveling companion, Noe
Santos Castro, was also taken away by police, who later denied they
were holding him and offered no information on his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for comment to the Attorney General's Office, which
controls the federal police, went unanswered. Edgar Tapia, customs
director at the airport, confirmed that two plainclothes police
searched travelers for drugs and weapons at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not aware of what kind of treatment they give the
people they subject to searches,'' Tapia said. He said the airport
participates in a nationwide program that seeks to guarantee good
treatment for Mexican resident abroad when they return to visit the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Abuses against returning Mexicans -- common robberies or
extortion by corrupt policemen -- have frequently been reported in
the past. Mexicans living abroad generally earn much more than
their countrymen, a fact that may make them a target for such
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Morlet said one tourist from Chicago had accused the policemen
of unjustly detaining and threatening him with a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal complaints on any of the allegations have been filed
with local police, according to both Morlet and Tapia.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Santos said the harassment began after one of his
suitcases didn't turn up when his flight landed in Acapulco. After
reporting the lost bag, he went through customs, where he got a
''green light'' from a random selection device, meaning he would
not be searched.
</P>
<P>
   The agents detained him anyway, Angel Santos said. According to
one airport official, standard procedure states that travelers
cannot be detained in airport interrogation rooms unless they have
been caught with contraband or are suspected of carrying it, or
face criminal charges.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense Cost Reported  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A national missile shield that would offer
limited protection from attack by smaller, newly armed countries
would cost almost $60 billion through 2015, the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office says.
</P>
<P>
   A CBO report released Tuesday said that's how much would be
needed to defend the country from attack by a relatively small
number of incoming ballistic missiles. It said those missiles could
contain nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, capable of killing
millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   The report cautioned that many still believe hostile countries
just developing long-range missiles, such as North Korea or Iran,
could find easy ways to outmaneuver the proposed defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who
requested the report with Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., said it made clear that the criteria of cost,
operability, effect on national security and impact on arms
reduction efforts can't be ignored in deciding whether to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is far too soon to evaluate the overall feasibility or
advisability of the missile defense project,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a chief proponent of a missile
defense system, said the CBO estimate was far too high and has ''no
basis in reality.'' ''You can't put a price on protecting American
cities,'' Weldon said, but $60 billion was ''totally out of line,
out of synch with anything I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year passed by large majorities, and President
Clinton signed, a bill stating it is the policy of the United
States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, a system
capable of defending U.S. territory against limited ballistic
missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The program has had problems with test failures and has met
strong opposition from nuclear powers such as Russia and China.
Russia says it would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
and threatened to pull out of other arms-reduction pacts if the
United States builds the system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to decide this fall, after another Pentagon test of
the system in June, whether to continue with plans to have it
operating by a target date of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO said the first phase of a national missile defense would
cost $29.5 billion through 2015, $3.9 billion more than the
administration has estimated.
</P>
<P>
   It would include locating 100 interceptors in central Alaska,
constructing a high-resolution X-band radar and upgrading several
existing early-warning radars.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase, to be deployed by 2010 under current plans,
would use satellites that could track not only powered-flight
missiles but also missiles gliding through space. The third phase
would add 150 interceptors, some at a second site currently planned
for Grand Forks, N. D.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has not yet estimated the cost of the last
two phases. The CBO said the second phase would cost another $6.1
billion and the third phase $13.3 billion through 2015. It said
another $10.6 billion would be needed for space-based sensors,
satellites that share have other missions with support of missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''The costs are going up, up and away,'' said Daryl Kimball of
the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, an advocacy group that
believes a national missile defense is unlikely to work even
against a minimal threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress and the American people, once they realize this, will
experience a bit of sticker shock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the system insist the cost is justified because the
threat is increasing for long-range missile attack from North Korea
or a similar potential adversary.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan in the 1980s proposed the far more ambitious
Strategic Defense Initiative, or ''Star Wars,'' a space-based
anti-missile system designed mainly to defend against Soviet
attack.

<HEADLINE> Group: Farm Subsidies Go To Few  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Big farms are hogging federal subsidies that
should be targeted to smaller producers, an environmental group
says.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of almost $23 billion in federal farm
subsidies went to just 10 percent of the subsidy recipients from
1996 to 1998, according to an analysis of Agriculture Department
records by the Environmental Working Group.
</P>
<P>
   The 144,000 farmers and landowners that make up that top 10
percent received $13.8 billion in subsidies between 1996 and 1998,
an average of $95,875 each. The average payment for the remaining
90 percent of subsidy recipients was $6,941.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surely we can do better by taxpayers and farmers than to
funnel so much money to so few farmers without even bothering to
find out if they need it,'' said Clark Williams-Derry, who
conducted the study that was released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Payments were especially concentrated among large farms in
southern states. In Mississippi, 10 percent of the recipients, some
1,985 people in all, received 83 percent of the farm subsidies, an
average of $217,000 each over the three years. The average payment
for the other 90 percent of recipients in the state was $4,908.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty farms in Mississippi got at least $1 million each. In
Arkansas, one recipient collected $7 million over the three years,
while another got $5.6 million. Names of individual recipients are
not released by USDA.
</P>
<P>
   Payments were the least concentrated in Iowa. The top 10 percent
of recipients received 45 percent of all payments to the state, or
an average of $80,546 each over the three years studied.
</P>
<P>
   The study analyzed 30 million records for payments totaling
$22.9 billion over the three-year period. They include ''market
transition'' payments capped at $40,000 per farmer or landowner
during the period that was studied and commodity price supports for
grain and cotton that were limited to $75,000 per recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress doubled those payment caps to $80,000 and
$150,000 respectively. Then in February, Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman effectively abolished the $150,000 limit on crop subsidies
by agreeing to implement a program authorized by Congress that
allows farmers to take the payments in certificates that they can
redeem for government-held commodities. Glickman later warned that
the program could become an embarrassment for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes are likely to ensure that large farms are now
getting an even larger share of the total payments than the study
showed, Williams-Derry said.
</P>
<P>
   The group recommended Congress sharply lower the payment limits
to target payments to smaller producers.
</P>
<P>
   But farm groups that oppose limits on federal subsidies say that
farms of all sizes need help.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a fallacy that only small farmers are hurting. You've
got big farmers that are hurting, too,'' said Mary Kay Thatcher, a
spokeswoman for the American Farm Bureau Federation.

<HEADLINE> Senate Mulls Victims' Rights Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a debate that delves into the controversial
issue of amending the Constitution, the Senate is weighing a
proposal that would grant victims of violent crimes certain rights.
</P>
<P>
   On an 82-12 vote, the Senate agreed Tuesday to begin debate on a
victims' rights measure. A vote on the amendment itself could occur
by the end of the week, but some Democrats have indicated they may
try to delay it with a lengthy debate on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the amendment said it is needed to balance
constitutional protections that suspects and criminals receive.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States Constitution guarantees 15 separate rights
to criminal defendants and each of these rights was established by
amendment to the Constitution,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif. ''There is not one word written in the U.S. Constitution
on behalf of crime victims.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents accused the amendment's backers of trying to
tinker with the Constitution. ''Some of my colleagues apparently
think it (the Constitution) is a rough draft, available for
amendment at a whim,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment specifies that victims of crimes or their families
would be guaranteed such rights as reasonable notice of court
proceedings and an offender's release or escape, the right to
attend and be heard at legal proceedings and court-ordered
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, the Senate rejected by four votes a
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning. A two-thirds majority
-- 67 votes in the Senate -- is required in each house to advance a
constitutional amendment. It then must be ratified by at least 35
state legislatures
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said he would use the victims'
rights debate to press his and President Clinton's demand for new
restrictions, including up to a 72-hour-waiting period, on the sale
of guns at gun shows. The Senate passed such a measure last year,
but the House rejected it. Republican leaders have rejected calls
since then for a meeting to resolve the differences over gun
control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ought to stick to the subject here,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl,
R-Ariz., who with Feinstein is a chief sponsor of the victims'
rights amendment. ''We all know one good way to defeat a good idea
is to talk it to death.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure in the House has yet to be acted upon by the
Judiciary Committee. Some Democrats said they would push a
substitute measure to write similar guarantees into federal law.
Currently, 32 states have some form of victims' rights laws in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims groups agree with opponents. ''Our belief is that
resources and energy need to be focused in other more pressing and
critical matters,'' said Gordon Campbell, executive director of
Victim Services, the nation's largest victims' assistance group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the proposed amendment does have strong support,
including from such groups as Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

<HEADLINE> West Nile prevention effort under way in 17 states  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Federal health officials are working with
17 states to prevent an outbreak of the West Nile Virus, which last
year killed seven people in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Ostroff, West Nile coordinator for the federal Centers
for Disease Control, said surveillance of mosquitos and birds that
carry the virus is under way in states along the Atlantic seaboard
and the Gulf of Mexico. Humans may contract the virus when they are
bitten by an infected mosquito.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are concerned that birds from the Northeast may have
spread the virus, a form of encephalitis, when they migrated south
for the winter. An infected dead bird was found in Baltimore, the
only bird with the virus to be found outside the New York City
area, Ostroff said.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC provided the 17 states and two cities considered at risk
with $2.7 million to create surveillance programs.
</P>
<P>
   States and cities targeted by the CDC are: Alabama, Connecticut,
District of Columbia, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, New
York City, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, Texas and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, a Westchester Democrat on the House
Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the CDC, is asking for
another $5 million to combat the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who become infected either show no reaction or
become mildly ill with flu-like symptoms. Fatalities are rare. The
most vulnerable are the elderly, the very young and those with
immune deficiencies. In those people, the virus can cause the brain
lining to swell.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials who were caught off guard by the outbreak last
year in New York City said they are better prepared this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many of the areas that were involved in the outbreak last
year ... there are intense prevention efforts under way,'' Ostroff
said at a lengthy briefing on the virus Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the full reach of the virus will likely not be known
until mosquitos stir from hibernation in the coming weeks.
Researchers have already detected the virus in some hibernating
mosquitos in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A CDC survey of some 600 people in the Whitestone neighborhood
in Queens, one of the most severely affected areas during last
year's outbreak, found that 2.5 percent of the residents were
infected with the virus, Ostroff said. Health officials tested
residents' blood.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chances of becoming seriously ill from the virus
are low, officials still suggest that people in at-risk states wear
insect repellant and eliminate pools of stagnant water, which are
breeding grounds for mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Johnson, of the Environmental Protection Agency, also
suggested that communities use larvicides to kill mosquito larvae.
Larvicides are already being used in New York City. They pose less
risk to humans than pesticides, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mass spraying of malathion, which was used last year in New York
City, should be used only as a last resort, he said.

<HEADLINE> Boy Seeks Help After Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF BARNARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDFORD, Ore. (AP) -- Three times, cars sped by Chris Palmer as
the boy stood on an isolated stretch of highway, waving for
somebody to help him rescue his injured father and sister from the
wreckage of their small plane.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody stopped, forcing him to retrace his steps -- guided only
by his family's voices -- back to a remote forest clearing as
darkness fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is only 11 years old, but as far as I'm concerned, he has
the heart of a lion,'' said his mother, Patti Palmer, as she sat
with her son at a Medford hospital Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chris' father, John Kenneth Palmer, a 47-year-old financial
planner from San Jose, Calif., and his 13-year-old daughter,
Stephani, were both in fair condition following Sunday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   The father and his two children were traveling to Medford from
Los Banos, Calif., when the engine of their small plane cut out
over the rugged Cascade Range at the California border.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, whose mother had stayed behind in California, helped his
dad spot a clearing because they didn't have enough altitude to
reach a little airfield they could see in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Palmer managed to glide the single-engine Piper to a crash
landing between two trees that ripped the wings off before the
fuselage ground to a halt in the mud, ending up on its side. He
then managed to kick out the windshield and helped his son get the
boy's sister out of the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Some bones in Stephani's lower back had been cracked and she
couldn't walk. Palmer was bleeding from facial cuts and fading in
and out of consciousness from a severely bruised chest.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, a fifth grader who likes to ride his bike, play video
games and make things out of Legos, decided to look for help.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, search and rescue teams had mobilized to look for the
plane after Seattle's air traffic control center reported an
emergency locator transmitter signal was coming from the area.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of one of the cars that passed Chris called 911 to
report that a child had tried to flag them down, and the dispatcher
figured it might be related to the crash, said state police Sgt.
Ralph Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the trio was rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no doubt about the Lord's hand on my family,'' said
Patti Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Chris said he didn't feel like a hero, and credited his father's
pilot skills for saving their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The crash has not discouraged the boy from getting his own
pilot's license.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's just the way things happen sometimes,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Increase in Panama Drug Trafficking  </HEADLINE>
By LISA J. ADAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORMER HOWARD AIR FORCE BASE, Panama (AP) -- Buzzards are the
only thing taking off and landing these days on Howard Air Force
Base's deserted runway.
</P>
<P>
   Counternarcotics surveillance flights -- a key element of U.S.
efforts to curb the flow of cocaine and heroin from South America --
ceased last year, when the base was turned over to Panama along
with other Panama Canal operations.
</P>
<P>
   That has alarmed some U.S. and Latin American officials, who
argued that the Pacific base is an irreplaceable weapon in the war
on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Both U.S. authorities and drug experts say that in the long run,
operations launched to take the place of Howard will actually
provide equal, if not better coverage than what was in place
before.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take time for the new facilities to get fully up and
running. In the meantime, ''This has opened up a new avenue for the
Colombian traffickers and their guerrilla allies to ship drugs,''
said Bruce Bagley, professor of international studies at the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a major upsurge in small aircraft leaving
Colombia and in heroin and cocaine shipments leaving the country,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian Minister of Defense Luis Fernando Ramirez said in
February that since Howard's drug operations shut down last May,
authorities have seen an increase in drug trafficking flights out
of the country, and the Pacific has been left totally unprotected
by radar.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian officials hope to compensate in part with helicopters
and counter-drug training that would result from a proposed $1.6
billion U.S. aid package now before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, there's been some degradation of coverage, but
confirming what windows are left unlocked for the burglar is not a
good idea,'' said Stephen Lucas, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern
Command, the warfighting command with responsibility for Central
and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said once other airfields being used as replacements for
Howard are fully operational, that will change.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Charles Wilhelm, the ranking U.S. military officer for
Latin America, has testified that once all the new staging areas
are ready, surveillance will be 110 percent of what it was when
Howard was the base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials, meanwhile, say Howard's closure hasn't had
any effect on drug-fighting efforts on the isthmus.
</P>
<P>
   ''What enables us to investigate the large drug-trafficking
networks are the civilian authorities who do this type of work,''
said anti-drug prosecutor Rosendo Miranda. ''Those authorities
remain in the country and we maintain the same levels and channels
of communication with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The counterdrug operations at Howard Air Force Base -- which
included 2,000 surveillance flights a year -- are now being carried
out by U.S. Air Force aircraft using what the Pentagon calls
''forward operating locations'' at airfields on Curacao and Aruba
in the Netherlands Antilles north of Venezuela, and in Manta,
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also are negotiating for another location in an
undisclosed country in Central America. The three current airfields
all have been activated since Howard closed, but won't be operating
at full capacity until runway improvements are completed at Manta
and airplane parking areas are built on Curacao and Aruba, Lucas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the funding for the Manta improvements is still tied up
in Congress, while negotiations are ongoing for the fourth
location, Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Gamarra, director of the Latin American and Caribbean
Center at Florida International University, said while the
airfields ultimately will provide better coverage than Howard in
the long run, they also could double or triple the cost of the drug
war.
</P>
<P>
   ''You basically had to construct these other bases, negotiate
with three countries, put in a lot of resources,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas says the airfields will, in fact, be much more economical
to run than Howard, a 5,290-acre complex that was ''a small city in
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The electric bill alone was $1 million a month,'' he said.
Startup and improvement costs for the current airstrips for fiscal
years 2000 and 2001 are estimated at $122 million, and operating
costs for all of them, including the one still under negotiation,
are anticipated to average $14 million to $18 million a year, Lucas
said.
</P>
<P>
   That is compared to the $75.8 million a year it cost to operate
Howard in its last full year, Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the current airstrips began operating, there have been
''significant busts'' both in the Caribbean and western Pacific,
Lucas said. In addition, the United States continues to run
anti-drug flights out of Puerto Rico, Guantanamo Bay, and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always what we call the balloon effect: When you
squeeze one part of the balloon, the traffickers go to another,''
he said. ''Everything you do they have a counteraction to it.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Call RNC Census Trivial  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican National Committee defended its
use of a fund-raising mailing that includes a GOP-specific census
form that Democrats contend trivializes the Census Bureau's efforts
to count the country's population.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., asked the Postal Service to
investigate the six-page document mailed to party members in an
envelope emblazoned with the phrase ''REPUBLICAN CENSUS DOCUMENT
ENCLOSED.'' Maloney demanded Tuesday that RNC chairman Jim
Nicholson end the mailing immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time when we are engaged in a once-a-decade civic
ceremony, the RNC, in a shameful attempt to capitalize on our
national count, is soliciting funds under the banner of the
census,'' said Maloney, ranking member of the House Government
Reform Committee's census panel.
</P>
<P>
   RNC spokesman Mike Collins called the criticism a ''partisan
cheap shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ''How could anybody be confused by that?'' Collins said. ''No
one was confused by this piece of mail. It was clearly a
fund-raising and legitimate participation piece.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest squabble between Republicans and Democrats over
Census 2000 comes just as the Census Bureau readies 440,000
temporary workers to gather information from 42 million households
that did not mail back census forms. That operation begins
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Tuesday to Postmaster General William Henderson,
Maloney said that ''while the content of the enclosed letter does
not resemble an official census questionnaire, it is worth noting
that nowhere on the mailing does it clarify that this solicitation
has no connection whatsoever to the 2000 Census.''
</P>
<P>
   The first page of the cover letter is written on Republican
National Committee letterhead, and the bottom of the page reads the
phrase ''Not printed at taxpayers' expense. Paid for by the RNC.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Postal Inspector Daniel Mihalko said he had yet to see the
RNC mailing.
</P>
<P>
   Census Director Kenneth Prewitt also said he had not seen the
mailing. He had been critical of a mailing earlier this year by the
conservative Southeastern Legal Foundation which the Postal Service
said implied a connection to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything at this stage of the census which creates confusion
about the authentic census would harm the census,'' Prewitt said.
''I would urge anyone engaged in mass mailing to refrain from any
kind of mailing that could be confused to appear like a census
form.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising letter is addressed ''Dear Republican'', and
was sent out on April 10, the day before a deadline to mail back
Census Bureau questionnaires, said Chip Walker, spokesman for
census subcommittee chairman Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The form poses questions such as ''Do you favor abolishing our
current tax system?'', and ''Should Congress work to outlaw
so-called 'homosexual marriages?'''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hypocrisy, but even more than that, it's downright
misleading,'' Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Jenny
Backus said.
</P>
<P>
   But Walker called the criticism ''much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very clear that this mailing is from the RNC,'' he said.
''In no place does it encourage people not to send in their (Census
Bureau) forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, several leading Republicans including aides
to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said they had
suggested to constituents concerned about their privacy being
invaded to skip those questions they might find intrusive.

<HEADLINE> One Dead in Texas Prison Riot  </HEADLINE>
By PAM EASTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAMESA, Texas (AP) -- A dinnertime riot that began in the kitchen
of a west Texas prison Tuesday left one inmate dead and at least 25
others injured, some of them critically, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The riot began around 6:30 p.m. at the Smith Unit and was under
control by midnight, said John Barton, spokesman for Warden Lupe
Lozano.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it was racial in nature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't know which groups were involved or how many
inmates took part. No guards were involved in the melee, which
included a small fire in the kitchen that caused no structural
damage.
</P>
<P>
   A fight began in the kitchen at meal time and spread to the
prison yard, where more fights developed, Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   Guards used a pepper spray-like substance to subdue the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you've ever been sprayed with CS gas, you would stop what
you were doing and become compliant,'' Barton said. ''Now, they
just want to make sure they have all the inmates and they can put
them in their cells and lock them down.''
</P>
<P>
   The all-male prison, about 60 miles south of Lubbock, was
designed to hold 1,276 minimum- and medium-security prisoners but
currently houses about 1,400. The unit employs 373 employees,
according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine inmates were taken to University Medical Center in
Lubbock for treatment, said Terry Martin, house supervisor at the
hospital. None of those injuries was life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Other inmates were taken to Brownfield Regional Medical Center.
The hospital refused to give information, but Barton said some of
the injuries were critical.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the inmate who died was unavailable. Inmates used
weapons during the fight, but Barton said the types were not
immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 officers from the Lamesa Police Department and other
nearby law enforcement agencies surrounded the prison, said Melissa
Gonzalez, communications officer for Lamesa police.

<HEADLINE> Heat 84, Pistons 82  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Detroit Pistons, who sounded so happy to start
the playoffs in Miami, head home without a win -- and perhaps
without Grant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Mashburn banked in an 8-foot jumper with six seconds left
Tuesday night, and the Miami Heat beat Detroit 84-82 for a 2-0 lead
in their best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   Hill sat out most of the second half after aggravating an injury
to his left foot. The All-Star forward was scheduled to undergo an
MRI today when the team returned to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt something pop,'' a dejected Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons, who haven't won a playoff series since 1991, face
possible elimination by the Heat on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's see if they can play the same way in a hostile
environment,'' Pistons center Terry Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat's latest win came after they blew a six-point lead in
the final 2:08. Detroit's last chance ended when Jerry Stackhouse
slipped driving to the basket and lost the ball, which Miami's Dan
Majerle recovered as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel sick,'' Stackhouse said. ''I thought I had a clear path
to the basket so I tried to attack it. Then I backed out for a jump
shot and I slipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill, bothered by a bone bruise in his foot since late in the
regular season, hopped to the bench in pain early in the third
quarter and kicked the back of a chair in frustration. He played
only 33 seconds the rest of the way and finished with nine points
in 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guys played great,'' he said. ''They played their rears
off. We just came up short at the end. Mashburn came up with an
unbelievable shot.''
</P>
<P>
   With the score 82-82, Miami took possession after Stackhouse had
a driving shot blocked with 26 seconds to go. As the clock ran
down, Mashburn took the ball on the left side, spun to split
defenders Lindsey Hunter and Michael Curry, then released a shot
over Christian Laettner for the winning score.
</P>
<P>
   ''He split me and made the big shot,'' Hunter said. ''I got
there a little late.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn said he knew the Pistons would try to strip the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expected somebody to come, so I kept the ball real low and
used a little misdirection,'' he said. ''It worked out well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill sank his first three shots in the opening five minutes, but
those were his only baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't remember when I felt that good at the start of the
game,'' Hill said. ''I was energized. I got into a good rhythm
early.''
</P>
<P>
   But he aggravated the injury in the first period. His limp
became progressively worse, and by the start of the second half he
was wincing and hopping around on one foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's admirable he's out there trying to play,'' Miami's Alonzo
Mourning said. ''But we're in a war right now. I'm really not
concerned with it. We've got one of our warriors out, and they
don't care about that.''
</P>
<P>
   All five Heat starters scored in double figures to overcome Tim
Hardaway's absence and foul trouble that hampered Mashburn,
Mourning and P.J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn had 24 points and Mourning 22. Rookie Anthony Carter,
again coolly filling in for Hardaway, had 10 points and 13 assists,
a Heat franchise playoff record. Hardaway missed his second
consecutive game because of a sore left foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a great game, and we'll take it,'' coach Pat Riley
said. ''Offensively we did just enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse led Detroit with 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   About 125 people demonstrated near the arena before the game to
protest the Elian Gonzalez case, but despite a general strike
called by Cuban Americans, there were few no-shows in the announced
crowd of 16,500.
Notes: Detroit had only three offensive rebounds. ... The Pistons
are averaging 84.5 points per game in the series, well below their
regular-season average of 103.5. ... Riley wore two bandage strips
over his left eye, the result of an accident in his swimming pool.
... Riley praised Lenny Wilkens, who resigned Monday as coach of
the Atlanta Hawks. Wilkens and Riley rank 1-2 in career coaching
victories. ''He's got a pretty good resume,'' Riley said wryly. ''I
think he's going to get a job.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- As the second period wound down, Owen Nolan
wound up, and got a big surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's 65-foot drive from outside the blue line, which
deflected into the net off Roman Turek's glove to give the San Jose
Sharks a 2-0 lead, was the last in a series of crazy bounces that
graced the Western Conference's No. 8 seed. It also was the killer
as they eliminated the NHL's regular-season champions, the St.
Louis Blues, with a 3-1 Game 7 victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a fluky series for goals,'' Nolan said. ''I thought,
'Why not just shoot it on net and see what happens?' He bobbled it
and it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Turek, who won a Stanley Cup last year with the Dallas Stars
without playing a minute, was devastated after the end of his first
postseason as a regular.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel so bad,'' Turek said. ''I think it was a key moment.
You cannot win in the playoffs if you have goaltending like I
played these games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues seemingly seized control in Game 6 with a 6-2 victory
in San Jose, chasing Sharks goalie Steve Shields after scoring five
second-period goals. But they landed with a thud in their quest to
become the 16th team in NHL history to rally from a 3-1 series
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Their franchise-record 114 points and Presidents' Trophy are
hollow reminders of what could have been.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, there was a lot of talk about us going a long
way,'' said Scott Young, who scored his sixth goal in the third
period. ''But you can never look past the first round. It's
something that we didn't seem to mentally prepare for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues are only the second NHL regular-season champion to get
knocked out in the first round, joining the 1991 Chicago
Blackhawks. Since the Presidents' Cup was established in the
1985-86 season, only four of the 15 winners have gone on to win the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Shields made a strong comeback from his Game 6 disaster,
stopping 21 shots. The Sharks' confidence in Shields never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good to see that after the embarrassment of the last game
that we got refocused, especially Shields,'' Nolan said. ''He
really got the job done for us.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew he'd be solid and we just tried to build our game
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Stern and Jeff Friesen also scored for the Sharks, who
finished 27 points behind the Blues. This is their third major
first-round upset in the nine-year franchise history, joining
triumphs over No. 1 conference seed Detroit in 1994 and No. 2
Calgary in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''They withstood all the Chicken Littles who said they weren't
going to win a game,'' coach Darryl Sutter said. ''The team that
won deserved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks will face the Pacific Division champion Dallas Stars
in the second round beginning, Friday night at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, it's Detroit at Colorado in the West, while
New Jersey is at Toronto and Pittsburgh visits Philadelphia in the
East.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who had a hat trick in Game 6, scored on a third-period
power play for St. Louis. But Blues stars Al MacInnis and Pierre
Turgeon were quiet, and captain Chris Pronger was on the ice for
the Sharks' first two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Stern gave the Sharks the lead on the game's second shot with
his first goal, and point, of the playoffs. Turek was slow to
recover and out of position when Stern took the puck off the glass
behind the net and slipped in a backhand shot at 2:51.
</P>
<P>
   A miscue by defenseman Marc Bergevin helped the Sharks make it
3-0. Bergevin tried to catch a puck, but bobbled it as Friesen and
Tomas Sundstrom converged on him, creating a 2-on-none break.
Friesen misfired on his first attempt, but slapped it home after
the puck got tangled in a bunch of legs near the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues narrowed the gap to two goals when Young scored at
2:09 of the third, seconds after Pronger hit the goal post and the
goal light went on prematurely. Some of the Sharks appeared to
relax.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis missed a chance to make it closer after Stephane
Matteau got a double minor for high-sticking Ladislav Nagy at 2:12.
Al MacInnis blunted the power play, which featured 29 seconds of
5-on-3 advantage, when he was called for holding at 3:33.

<HEADLINE> Players, Coaches Join Cuba Strike  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- There were few signs inside Pro Player Stadium that
broached the Cuban-American community's work stoppage. There were
even fewer protesters outside Florida's game against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   So the Marlins didn't truly feel the effects of Tuesday's
protest until the 11th inning of their 6-4 loss to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   That's when manager John Boles, out of position players, was
forced to pinch hit for a pitcher with another pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   In a first for baseball, players and coaches around the majors
skipped games, joining a work stoppage by Miami's Cuban-American
community to protest Elian Gonzalez's removal from the home of his
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to go with what you have,'' Marlins outfielder
Cliff Floyd said. ''You can't cry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Jose Canseco was the most prominent player to sit
out, joining six Florida Marlins, two San Francisco Giants, Mets
shortstop Rey Ordonez and Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez.
Several coaches also missed games.
</P>
<P>
   Florida third baseman Mike Lowell, pitchers Alex Fernandez and
Vladimir Nunez -- all of Cuban descent -- decided to sit out.
Dominican teammates Antonio Alfonseca, Jesus Sanchez and Danny
Bautista joined them in a show of support.
</P>
<P>
   It significantly hurt the Marlins, who started the game with 19
players, including just four on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Florida ran out of bench options in the 11th, having to pinch
hit Brad Penny for Dan Miceli, essentially giving up an out when it
needed a rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a tough loss,'' Boles said. ''These guys fought their
hearts out. Those guys were spent. We had guys cramping up. We gave
them everything we had.
</P>
<P>
   ''But there's no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Armando Rios doubled home Doug Mirabelli in the top of the
inning, leading the Giants to their fourth straight win. Mirabelli,
the only Giants catcher in uniform, snapped an 0-for-18 streak with
a single off Miceli (2-1) in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gardner (2-1) pitched the final two innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the focus was on the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ''It affected us big time, but it affected them more,'' Giants
manager Dusty Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker advised right-hander Livan Hernandez and catcher Bobby
Estalella not to come to the ballpark, fearing for the safety of
their family members who live in South Florida. Administrative
coach Carlos Alfonso, another Cuban-American, also took the day
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're talking about life and death situations that supersedes
baseball,'' Baker said. ''A lot of us don't know the situation
unless you live in Miami or you're from Miami. It's sad that
politics have to go into baseball, but baseball is part of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were merely following the Marlins' lead.
</P>
<P>
   Florida general manager Dave Dombrowski said any of the club's
front-office personnel, players and coaches wanting to support the
protest would be excused with pay for the day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the players, third base coach Fredi Gonzalez,
infield coach Tony Taylor, bullpen catcher Luis Perez and assistant
equipment manager Javier Castro accepted the offer. So did
Cuban-American Hall of Famer Tony Perez, an assistant to
Dombrowski.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not saying what's right and wrong,'' Boles said. ''The
organization is not making a value judgment; the organization is
merely being sensitive to its employees. If I didn't have to be
here, I wouldn't. I've got a lot of Cuban friends and I know how
deeply they feel about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, Nunez, Sanchez, Alfonseca and the Hernandez brothers
all were not scheduled to play Tuesday regardless of the work
stoppage because it was not their turn to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, meanwhile, had to replace Ordonez and third base coach
Cookie Rojas. They arrived at Shea Stadium about 3{ hours before
gametime, met with general manager Steve Phillips and Bobby
Valentine and left the park shortly thereafter, having decided to
sit out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets backed the decision, and Phillips said both team
members would be paid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Baseball should not be a political forum, but they felt they
needed to support the community in which they live, and I support
their decision,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez and Rojas were both born in Cuba and live in Florida
during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers first baseman Rafael Palmeiro, who is Cuban, and Reds
outfielder Alex Ochoa, whose parents were born there, were among
the Cuban-Americans who played.
</P>
<P>
   ''The team needs me,'' Palmeiro said Monday. ''Unless I get a
call from somebody really big, I'm playing. My responsibilities are
to my family and my teammates. So as of right now, I'm in the
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa, who had only 28 at-bats this season, spent the day
thinking about the situation. And while he fully supports the
cause, Ochoa did not want to miss an opportunity to be in the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an easier decision for an everyday player,'' Ochoa said.
''I didn't want to let the team down.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest over Elian Gonzalez brought honking cars and waving
Cuban flags to the streets of Miami's Little Havana, the same
streets where fires and violence broke out Saturday after armed
federal agents grabbed the 6-year-old Cuban boy in a pre-dawn raid.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters were hard to find at Tuesday's Marlins game, although
at least one was in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here, but it doesn't mean I feel any different than the
other guys,'' pitcher Ricky Bones said. ''People express themselves
differently.''

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- San Antonio threw some big offense at the
Phoenix Suns in the first half. It was enough for the Spurs to get
back into their first-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson had 25 points and 15 rebounds, helping the Spurs
overcome a nine-point third quarter for an 85-70 victory on Tuesday
night, tying the series 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 is scheduled for Saturday in Phoenix. The Suns held off
the Spurs 72-70 in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the other game Tuesday night, it was Miami 84, Detroit 82 as
the Heat took a 2-0 lead. Tonight, Toronto is at New York and
Minnesota visits Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ''A strong start was definitely the focus tonight,'' said
Robinson, held to 11 points on 3-for-12 shooting in Game 1. ''I
wanted to set the tone early. I got some great opportunities, then
in the second half, Avery (Johnson) did a great job for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson led a 17-3 Spurs run in the second quarter for a 51-37
halftime lead, and they needed the cushion because the Suns'
defense stiffened in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix scored only 14 in the period and Johnson came on for
12 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter. The combined 23
third-quarter points set an NBA low, breaking the 25 points scored
by Atlanta and New York last May 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did a better job of moving around and making them play
defense,'' Robinson said. ''I thought that was the difference. I
got the ball more with opportunities that I liked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns allowed only two field goals in the third quarter, but
went cold in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not come out with the intensity we needed in the first
half,'' Penny Hardaway said. ''It was not the same as the level we
were playing in Game 1. We came out in the third quarter and played
much better with the kind of intensity we should have played all
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps, if we had done that this series would be 2-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway led Phoenix with 19 points and Rodney Rogers added 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the two games, we've been sloppy offensively,'' Suns coach
Scott Skiles said. ''We're not setting and our ball handling is
questionable. We're missing shots we normally make. We're award of
this and have to address it before Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied 34-34 with 6:19 remaining in the second
quarter, when the Spurs went on a 17-3 run to take a 14-point
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson started the run with a 16-foot jumper and had six
points in the spurt. Johnson also had six points as the Spurs took
their biggest lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still not in the best situation, losing the first game
set us back,'' Robinson said. ''We still have a lot of work ahead
of us. We've been playing better on the road than at home. I hope
we can continue that pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Robinson got Phoenix's only basket in the charge. The
other point came as a result of a technical foul against Spurs
coach Gregg Popovich.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs followed their plan to come out aggressively and go
right to David Robinson. The Spurs hit their first three shots,
including a jumper and slam dunk by Robinson, and held on for a
24-20 first-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 17-3 run put us in the driver's seat,'' Popovich said.
''Our defense played well, but we sputtered offensively. The
defense is what brought us home.''
</P>
<P>
Heat 84, Pistons 82
</P>
<P>
   After the Heat blew a six-point lead in the final 2:08, Jamal
Mashburn made an 8-footer with six seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's final chance ended when Jerry Stackhouse slipped
driving to the basket and lost the ball, which Miami's Dan Majerle
recovered as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Pistons star Grant Hill started, but played less than four
minutes in the second half because of a bruised left foot. He
scored nine points in 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn had 24 points and Alonzo Mourning 22 to lead Miami.
Stackhouse led Detroit with 26 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Phillies are the only team able to knock out
Randy Johnson this season. They just aren't good enough to beat the
Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson struck out 11 batters in 6 2-3 innings Tuesday night as
the Arizona Diamondbacks snapped a three-game losing streak with a
10-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a true stopper,'' Arizona's Steve Finley said. ''He's one
of the elite.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (5-0) allowed two runs and three hits on a 49-degree
night in Philadelphia. He recorded the 129th double-digit strikeout
game of his career and his fourth in five starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pitched 8 2-3 innings in a 6-4 victory over Philadelphia
on opening day and went the distance in his next three starts. He
left after throwing 117 pitches Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guys got me runs and it was my job to preserve it,'' he
said. ''The more pitches I don't throw early in the season, I'll be
that much better later in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games, it was San Francisco 6, Florida 4; the Mets 6,
Cincinnati 5; Atlanta 1, Los Angeles 0; Montreal 10, Colorado 4;
Pittsburgh 4, San Diego 3; Houston 11, the Cubs 7; and St. Louis 7,
Milwaukee 2.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Stinnett had his second, two-homer game of the season and
drove in four runs to lead Arizona. Travis Lee and Finley also
homered for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies, who were coming off a 1-6 road trip, have lost
four straight.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona took a 2-0 lead when Stinnett hit a two-run homer in the
second off Chris Brock (0-3). Stinnett hit his sixth homer in the
seventh inning, a two-run shot that made it 10-2. It was the third
two-homer game of Stinnett's career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was looking for something up, got good wood on it and the
wind helped it,'' Stinnett said of his first homer.
</P>
<P>
Giants 6, Marlins 4
</P>
<P>
   With much of the focus on a Cuban-American boycott, Armando Rios
hit an RBI double in the 11th inning off Dan Miceli (2-1) to give
visiting San Francisco its fourth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   The game had eight players sitting out as part of a work
stoppage by Miami's Cuban-American community. They protested Elian
Gonzalez's removal from the home of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gardner (2-1) pitched the final two innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
Mets 6, Reds 5
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell, robbed of a home run earlier by Ken Griffey Jr.,
homered off Scott Sullivan (0-1) to spark a seventh-inning rally
that gave New York its ninth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez and third base coach Cookie Rojas
were absent, in protest of the Elian Gonzalez case. Reds outfielder
Alex Ochoa, whose parents were born in Cuba, decided to play.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who blocked a trade last winter that would have sent
him from Seattle to the Mets, struck out three times in his Shea
Stadium debut.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell (2-0) got the win and Armando Benitez earned his
eighth save.
</P>
<P>
Braves 1, Dodgers 0
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta, Tom Glavine pitched a three-hitter to outduel Kevin
Brown and the Braves won their eighth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (4-0) no-hit the Dodgers for 4 1-3 innings, and Quilvio
Veras drove in the lone run with a two-out single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (1-1), returning from the 15-day disabled list, pitched
well, but sustained his first regular-season loss to the Braves
since July 13, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Expos 10, Rockies 4
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens hit a three-run homer and Michael Barrett had a
two-run double to lead host Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Widger also homered for Montreal as Carl Pavano (3-0)
allowed four runs in six innings to become the first Expos pitcher
to get three wins.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohanon (0-2) took the loss.
</P>
<P>
Pirates 4, Padres 3, 11 innings
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Brown doubled and scored the tying run in the ninth
against Trevor Hoffman, then tripled off Carlos Almanzar (0-1) and
scored the winning run in the 11th as Pittsburgh rallied at home.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sauerbeck (1-0) got the final out in the 11th for the
victory as the Pirates stopped a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
Cardinals 7, Brewers 2
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire homered for the third straight game and Darryl Kile
(4-1) won his fourth game.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who missed nine games this season with a sore back,
homered in the first, one out after a homer by Edgar Renteria off
Brewers starter Jason Bere (2-2).
</P>
<P>
Astros 11, Cubs 7
</P>
<P>
   At Houston, Moises Alou went 4-for-4 and Richard Hidalgo had
three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds (4-0) allowed four runs and seven hits in six
innings as the Astros snapped a three-game skid.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Downs (1-1) took the loss.

<HEADLINE> Victim's Blood Found in Lewis' Limo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Blood matching that of one of the two men
fatally stabbed during a post-Super Bowl melee was found inside the
rented limousine that Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis used
the morning of the murders, The (Baltimore) Sun reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police laboratory tests revealed traces of Jacinth Baker's blood
were also found in the area near where Lewis was sitting, according
to anonymous sources close to the investigation. The tests were
turned over by prosecutors to attorneys for Lewis and his two
co-defendants, all of whom face first-degree murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Lewis declined comment, citing a gag order imposed
by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged that soon after the murders in an Atlanta
nightclub district, some of the 11 passengers returned to the
vehicle ''dripping with blood'' from the altercation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was sitting in the rear of the limo, near the primary
passenger door that he and other occupants used. That suggests
others had passed by the player's seat and could have been
responsible for blood being in the vicinity, The Sun reported in
Wednesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and two other men, Reginald Oakley, and Joseph Sweeting,
are charged with the murders of Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24,
during a fight early Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   DNA tests taken from blood in the limo match samples taken from
Baker, Sweeting and Oakley, the paper reported. No blood matching
Lollar's was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have said Baker smashed a champagne bottle over
Oakley's head. Sweeting suffered a cut to his finger, allegedly
during the fight, according to court documents.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Track Cycling Trials Open  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRISCO, Texas (AP) -- Sky Christopherson knew every second would
count at the U.S. Olympic cycling trials, on the track and away
from it.
</P>
<P>
   Christopherson won the men's kilometer time trial in 1 minute,
5.044 seconds as the five-day trials began Tuesday. He asked for an
early start in the race so he could be rested for today's Olympic
sprint, a team event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to get as much recovery as I could. The Olympic
sprint is very important to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The kilometer time trial is cycling's version of the 400 meters
in track and field. It's a sprint that requires pacing, but any
competitor who doesn't go hard gets left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I could go 1:04.5, but my time was good enough today
to win,'' said Christopherson, of Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   He now moves to Olympic sprint, a new men's event for the Sydney
Games. Riding all out, one cyclist and then a second leaves the
track, one at a time, after the first two laps. The third rider
sprints another lap to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Christopherson will join two riders who shared the gold medal at
last summer's Pan American Games, Marcelo Arrue of Woodland Hills,
Calif., and Johnny Barrios of Redlands, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Hartwell of Indianapolis, the only American cyclist to win
medals in two Olympics, has changed from the speed races to
endurance. He's scheduled to compete in the men's individual
pursuit today.
</P>
<P>
   In individual pursuit, two racers start from opposite sides of
the track and race for the fastest times. The women go to three
kilometers and the men to four, but the race ends early if one
cyclist passes the other.
</P>
<P>
   Although Christopherson won the kilometer time trial, he was two
seconds behind the qualifying standard for a spot on the U.S. long
team, the pool of riders eligible for Olympic team consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kurreck of Los Altos, Calif., won the women's individual
pursuit in 3:47.538, more than 10 seconds behind the long team
qualifying standard. There was a good reason both times were slow.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic trials are being held early in the racing season
because U.S. coaches want to consider performances in World Cup
events, as well as training and trials results, before selecting
the team in July.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's early in the year,'' said Erin Veenstra-Mirabella of
Colorado Springs, third in individual pursuit at 3:50.721. ''After
we get a few World Cup races, the Olympic picture should be a
little clearer.''
</P>
<P>
   The long team qualifying times, established by U.S. Cycling, are
based on projected medal results at Sydney. To reach those marks, a
racer needs one of the world's best times for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Kurreck is safe because she's already on the long team as a road
racer. She wanted to qualify on the track, too, and practiced only
two days in Texas after taking a break from her road racing team in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did my first pursuit race in two years this morning in
qualifying. It took a little getting used to again,'' said Kurreck,
the runner-up in individual pursuit on the Frisco track at 1998
nationals.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Candidates Hold First Debate  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- In the first debate of one of the tightest
presidential races in Mexican history, opposition candidates bashed
the ruling party but offered few specifics on what they would
change if they end its 71-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   Tough-talking northerner Vicente Fox, who has pulled almost even
in polls with Francisco Labastida of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, appeared relaxed and conciliatory Tuesday as
he tried to use the debate to unite the divided opposition behind
his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tonight six candidates appeared, and five of us share a common
idea: the urgent need to get another party into power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All six presidential candidates appeared in the debate, which
allowed each 14 minutes to put forth their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The debate largely focused on the rivalry between the
front-runners, Labastida and Fox, but two of the other candidates
joined Fox in attacking what they called the record of corruption
of the ruling party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, who seemed touchy at times, attacked Fox's political
record directly, and depicted himself -- despite his lifelong career
in the PRI -- as ''the candidate of change ... Change with a course,
change with security for the country, true change.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Many politicians, from many parties, have used power to enrich
themselves,'' Labastida said, saying he would implement broad
anti-corruption programs.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the need to defeat the PRI almost as a mantra, the main
opposition candidates didn't get beyond vague promises of more
jobs, higher wages, better education, and more public safety -- the
touchstone issues for decades here.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard nice wishes, but I didn't find concrete proposals,''
political analyst Marco Levario said on a television panel
following the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Martinez, who listened to the debate on a radio at his
streetside taco stand, agreed: ''There wasn't anything firm. It was
all promises.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference following the 1{-hour debate, Labastida
said he hoped to focus on more specific economic and political
proposals in a second debate, tentatively scheduled for May 23. The
election is July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Fox made reference to the possibility of fraud in his remarks
after the debate: ''We still have 70 days left to election day. We
still face the action of the state apparatus, and the machinery of
the ruling party.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the July 2 elections could be Mexico's cleanest ever
and probably represent the best chance ever for the opposition to
defeat the PRI, which has held the presidency since it was founded
in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who favors cowboy boots and
represents the right-center National Action Party, has so far
failed to draw the center-left Democratic Revolution Party -- the
other main opposition group -- into an alliance.
</P>
<P>
   One of the debate's sharpest attacks came after Labastida told
the story of a woman who told him she was afraid to leave her house
because of crime in a city governed by Fox's party. Fox ridiculed
the story as borrowed from U.S. campaigns, reminding voters that
Clintonite James Carville advised Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very American to tell little stories that never
existed,'' Fox said. ''It's the only thing Mr. Labastida is
learning: how to follow the teachings of Mr. Carville.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, a former agriculture secretary, touted his plans to
revitalize Mexico's poor countryside. But Fox, a rancher, took him
on his own turf: ''We'll have a president who knows the
countryside, who's from the countryside, and not a bureaucrat who
doesn't even know how to milk a cow.''
</P>
<P>
   The two have traded insults during campaign stops, with
Labastida accusing Fox of speaking from both sides of his mouth,
and Fox -- at 6-foot-3 -- calling the 5-foot-9 Labastida ''shorty''
and ''more of the same.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than seven decades, the PRI has held onto the
presidency by means fair and foul, but the party has been forced by
both domestic and international pressure to make itself, and
Mexico's electoral system, more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have allowed the opposition to take state and local
governments, and opened up the possibility -- unthinkable a
generation ago -- that the PRI could even lose the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't think change is possible, just look at what has
happened in the world,'' Fox said, recalling the elections of
Nelson Mandela and Lech Walesa and the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today the eyes of the world are on Mexico. But only you can
decide.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine Tapes To Be Made Public  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN SLEVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The families of Columbine shooting victims who
successfully fought to have access to video taken during the
massacre are outraged that authorities will release the tapes to
the public as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows no regard whatsoever for the feelings of the
victims,'' said James Rouse, a lawyer for the families, after
learning of the Jefferson County sheriff's department decision on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The videotapes, which include footage from school surveillance
cameras in the cafeteria and two to three hours of helicopter
footage, were to be made available to the public, upon request,
starting this afternoon for a $25 fee.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson County sheriff's office was ordered Monday to turn
the tapes over to six families who wanted the footage to support
their claims that officers mishandled the shootings. They did so on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   County attorney Frank Hutfless surprised families by announcing
that copies of the tapes also would be made available to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really have less than 24 hours for the victims' families to
review it and get over the shock,'' said Rouse.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Velasquez, whose son Kyle was killed at Columbine,
wasn't surprised by the county's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just how it's been for the past year. This is life on
a daily basis for us, waiting to see what's next,'' she told
KUSA-TV.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the sheriff's office has angered Columbine
families by circulating a portion of the cafeteria surveillance
tape which eventually ended up on television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A 90-second segment was broadcast in October when it was leaked
to CBS after being shown as part of a training video at a
firefighters' seminar in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Sheriff John P. Stone later called the release
of the training video an embarrassment and ordered all copies
returned to his office.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Time magazine published a cover story based on five
videotapes the sheriff's office showed to a reporter. Stone
maintained they were shown only for background purposes, which Time
has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's department spokesman Steve Davis said he could not
comment on the decision to release the videotapes because it
involves a lawsuit filed by the families. No one answered the phone
at the county attorney's office Tuesday evening.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Prison Workers Said Racist  </HEADLINE>
By AMY FORLITI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana State Police has refuted a
report that alleges a group of white supremacist prison employees
used violence and racial epithets to intimidate inmates and their
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   A state police investigation found no evidence that such a group
exists, said Mel Carraway, the police agency's superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   But a 2{-year study by DePauw University's Russell J. Compton
Center for Peace and Justice released Tuesday claims a racist group
called the Brotherhood has operated for the past decade at
Putnamville Correctional Facility, a medium-security prison about
40 miles west of Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The contradictory studies didn't surprise activists who were
leery of allowing the State Police to investigate allegations
against employees of the Department of Correction, another state
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that racism is alive and well at Putnamville
Correctional Facility,'' said the Rev. Rick Miller, who raised
concerns about racist activity at the central-Indiana prison in
1998. ''The State Police report that there is no racism is just
plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the university report, some of the group's members
openly sported Brotherhood tattoos and swastika rings, and one wore
a Ku Klux Klan-style hood at work.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing subtle about what was going on at the
prison,'' said Kelsey Kauffman, the report's author. ''The
administration has allowed activity to go on without sanction.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees belonging to the group were not prison guards, but
low-level employees including cooks and sewage workers, Kauffman
said. A maximum of 25 out of 680 employees belonged to the group at
one time, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The DePauw report -- which examined more than 1,000 prison
documents -- also claims that Department of Correction Commissioner
Ed Cohn, a former superintendent of the prison, protected employees
who were part of the alleged group.
</P>
<P>
   While state police investigators acknowledge some friction among
prison employees, an investigation ordered last June by Gov. Frank
O'Bannon has so far turned up no evidence of an organized racist
group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our investigation uncovered no Brotherhood,'' said Carraway.
''There were factions that kept going at one another ... but it was
not racist in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Carraway said the probe found ''bickering'' among workers and
activity that included tobacco trafficking. But no abuse was found
to be directed at prisoners, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carraway also said there is no evidence Cohn has protected
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Two previous state investigations and an FBI probe have found no
evidence of the Brotherhood's existence, Carraway said.
</P>
<P>
   The DOC declined to comment because the investigation is
ongoing.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Prescription Costs Probed  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices for drugs that older Americans use most
often jumped higher than the rate of inflation last year, says an
advocacy group's study, which President Clinton will use to tout
his proposal to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders planned to release
the report at a White House briefing today to highlight soaring
drug prices and call on Congress to pass legislation giving all
Medicaid beneficiaries coverage for their medicines -- an idea
opposed by Republicans, who say aid should go to the neediest
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you are dealing with drugs prices increasing two, three
times the rate of inflation, the impact is extraordinary,
especially for a population that is living on a fixed income,''
said Ron Pollack, president of Families USA, which commissioned the
study. The group, which advocates universal health coverage for all
Americans, supports Clinton's drug benefit proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that wholesale prices for 50 prescriptions
frequently used by seniors rose by 3.9 percent last year, faster
than the overall rate of inflation at the retail level, which the
government reported at 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for all prescription drugs jumped 5.8 percent in 1999,
government figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs common to seniors have soared 30 percent on average since
1994, according to the group's study.
</P>
<P>
   Drug industry officials said the report exaggerates drug price
increases. A government measure of wholesale prices showed that
prices for all prescription drugs went up only 1.3 percent last
year, said Jackie Cottrell, spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA zeroed in on medicines most important to seniors to
highlight what Pollack says is the need for a broad drug insurance
program that will help all elderly Americans -- who are living
longer and whose doctors are increasingly treating with drugs -- to
deal with soaring prices at the pharmacy window.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed the wholesale price for a year's supply of
furosemide, a generic used to treat hypertension and congestive
heart failure, doubled to $57 as of January compared to its price a
year before.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a year's supply of Klor-Con 10, used as a potassium
replacement, jumped nearly 44 percent to $286 from $199, the report
said. Yearly price increases for other drugs cited in the report
include:
</P>
<P>
   --Glucophage, a diabetes drug, rose to $708 from $661.

   Clinton wants to add drug coverage to Medicare as an option for
all Americans age 65 or older. Administration officials say rising
drug prices are a problem for all seniors and want a broad plan --
costing $195 billion over 10 years -- for 39 million Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   They are locked in a heated debate with congressional Republican
leaders who believe drug coverage should go to low-income Americans
who need it most. Republicans say there's no reason to give drug
benefits to the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who already have
some type of coverage through HMOs or retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders earlier this month unveiled the outlines of a drug
proposal calling for private health plans to offer drug benefits
and government subsidies to pay drug costs for low-income seniors.
Most of the $40 billion they have earmarked for a five-year
overhaul of Medicare would go toward the drug plan, GOP lawmakers
said.

<HEADLINE> Park Service May Limit Snowmobiles  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- By next winter, visitors to many of the
national parks may be limited in their use of snowmobiles and
barred from using them altogether in some places.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service is announcing this week new
restrictions on the use of snowmobiles for recreation at more than
two dozen parks, monuments, recreational areas and other federal
park units, government and private sources said. In some cases
snowmobiles may be banned, according to sources, who asked not to
be identified further.
</P>
<P>
   Snowmobiles are allowed in more than 40 park units from Acadia
National Park in Maine to California's Sequoia National Park and
numerous parks in the Northwest and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   As the vehicles have grown in popularity in recent years,
however, a growing number of complaints have been filed by park
visitors annoyed by their noise and pollution. Some opponents of
snowmobile use say the vehicles also do damage to the parks.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement on ''measures to halt recreational use of
snowmobiles'' in national parks is to be made at a news conference
Thursday, the Interior Department said in an advisory, adding that
the aim is to ''halt the escalating recreational use of
snowmobiles'' within the park system.
</P>
<P>
   Additional details about the decision were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and the National Parks and Conservation
Association, a private park advocacy group, have argued that the
Park Service has failed for years to enforce existing regulations
against recreational snowmobiling at many national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Under regulations dating from the 1970s, the Park Service is
required to monitor off-road vehicle use, including snowmobiles,
and prohibit such uses if it is determined that they cause
environmental damage, said Kevin Collins of the National Parks and
Conservation Association.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Park Service has allowed virtually unrestricted
access to snowmobiles in many of the parks, ''with almost no
analysis of environmental effects,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision dealing with snowmobiles is likely to affect many
of the 28 parks outside of Alaska where snowmobiling now takes
place, those familiar with the issue said Tuesday. Alaska is likely
to be excluded from a snowmobile ban because parks in that state
are governed by different regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Collins said, the Voyageurs National Park in
Minnesota is likely to be left out of the review because Congress
specifically permitted snowmobile use when it created that park.
</P>
<P>
   Following are park units outside Alaska where recreational
snowmobiling is allowed, according to the National Parks and
Conservation Association:
</P>
<P>
   Appalachian National Scenic Trail; Acadia National Park in
Maine; Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area in Montana and
Wyoming; Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia; Black
Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in Colorado; Cedar Breaks
National Monument in Utah; Crater Lake National Park in Oregon;
Curecanti National Recreation Area in Colorado;
</P>
<P>
   Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania; Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado and Utah;
Grand Portage National Monument in Minnesota; Grand Teton National
Park in Wyoming; Herbert Hoover National Historic Site in Iowa;
John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway in Wyoming;
</P>
<P>
   Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, Mount Rainier National
Park, North Cascades National Park, Olympic National Park, and Ross
Lake National Recreation Area, all in Washington state; Perry's
Victory and International Peace Memorial in Ohio; Pictured Rocks
National Seashore in Michigan; Rocky Mountain National Park in
Colorado; Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks in California;
Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway in Wisconsin; Theodore
Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota; Voyageurs National Park in
Minnesota; Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana;
Zion National Park in Utah.

<HEADLINE> EPA Refuses To Regulate Coal Waste  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing opposition from the White House and
Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency has backed away from
declaring ash and other waste from coal-burning power plants as a
hazardous substance, although it urged states to strengthen
regulation of such wastes.
</P>
<P>
   The disposal of coal waste suddenly emerged as a hotly contested
environmental issue as the Clinton administration faced a
court-ordered deadline on deciding how to regulate the more than
100 million tons of the material generated annually by power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have complained that the waste, laced with
arsenic, mercury, lead and other toxic metals, is contaminating
water supplies because many states treat the waste with no more
safeguards than normal garbage. At the same time, electric
utilities have argued the waste does not pose a health or
environmental risk and that stricter regulations would dramatically
drive up the cost of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by a judge to make a decision by the end of the day,
the EPA announced late Tuesday it would develop, for the first
time, federal standards that states and the industry should meet in
disposing of coal waste, but not declare such waste as hazardous
under federal environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time EPA does not believe that regulation of the
materials as hazardous waste is justified,'' Michael McCabe, the
EPA's acting deputy administrator, said in a statement, adding that
if states and the industry fail to follow the federal standards the
agency would reconsider whether more stringent regulations are
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said it would urge states to require liners in land
fills and other disposal sites and special monitoring of nearby
waterways and groundwater when such wastes are buried. Some states
require neither at this time. Texas, for example, does not even
require a permit if the waste is put within 50 miles of a power
plant, environmentalists complained.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups accused the EPA of ''backpedaling'' under
pressure from business groups and the utility industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good science has been ambushed by bad politics,'' complained
Carolyn Johnson of the Citizens Coal Council, a federation of 53
grassroots advocacy groups near coal mines and power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Stant of the Hoosier Environmental Coalition, an
Indiana-based group that has been active in the national movement
for tighter controls on coal ash, called the EPA decision Tuesday
''a horrendous mistake'' and said it affords little additional
protection since states can ignore the federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The Edison Electric Institute estimated the if coal ash were
declared a hazardous substance it could cost utilities $3 billion
to $5 billion more in disposal costs.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities and business waged an intense lobbying campaign in
Congress and within the administration after the EPA signaled in
March that it planned to designate coal ash as a hazardous waste.
At least 59 members of Congress, including 33 senators, also raised
questions about the draft, noting that a year ago the EPA indicated
stricter regulations were not warranted.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA draft proposal for more stringent federal controls was
met with strong opposition from the Energy Department, the Interior
Department's minerals management agency, and officials at the White
House, according to sources familiar the internal debate in recent
weeks. Finally, the EPA retreated after a federal judge on Tuesday
refused to give the agency more time to develop the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Coal ash is subject to widely different requirements from state
to state.

<HEADLINE> 8th driver murdered; another arrested for assaulting passenger  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two livery cab drivers were carjacked overnight,
the day after the eighth livery cab driver this year was killed on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   A 46-year-old driver's car was stolen by two unidentified men at
about 11 p.m. Tuesday. Police said the driver had picked up the men
in lower Manhattan and drove them to Brooklyn. Once there, the
passengers said they couldn't open the doors. When the driver tried
to help, they pushed him away and stole his light blue Lincoln Town
Car, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 2 a.m. today, a Bronx livery driver was robbed at
knifepoint of $112 by three passengers who had called his company
for a pickup, police said. The unidentified 55-year-old driver was
thrown out of the car but was not seriously hurt. The robbers sped
off with the car.
</P>
<P>
   Police were looking for both cars and the robbers.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incidents involving cabbies came after driver George
Luciano seriously injured one of his passengers with a metal bar
following an argument on a Bronx street corner Tuesday, police
said. Luciano apparently thought he was about to be robbed.
Luciano, 45, has been charged with assault.
</P>
<P>
   Luciano was on his way to pick up a dispatched fare when Mario
King jumped into his cab at a Bronx intersection. Luciano told him
to get out, and the argument ensued, police said.
</P>
<P>
   As King exited the car, so did Luciano -- allegedly with a metal
bar. Luciano then allegedly hit King and drove off. His cab company
notified police about what happened, and Luciano was arrested. King
was listed in serious but stable condition at Jacobi Hospital hours
after the alleged attack.
</P>
<P>
   Luciano had likely heard of Monday night's shooting death of
livery cab driver Jose Olivares. The 35-year-old cabbie was the
eighth driver killed on the job this year. The Dominican Republic
native was shot once in the head shortly after 10 p.m. during a
botched robbery attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four passengers in the cab were injured when the car
crashed into an apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers -- two men, a boy and a girl -- were charged with
attempted robbery, murder and criminal possession of a weapon. They
were identified as John Rivera, 19; Ramon Anaya, 18; Norberto
Hernandez, 16; and Jasmine Valentine, 16.
</P>
<P>
   News of Olivares' death spread quickly and may have caused some
panic, as in Luciano's case.
</P>
<P>
   ''He thought he was going to be robbed,'' said a dispatcher
named Segfredo at Watson Car Service in the Bronx, where Luciano
has worked for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates concerned for livery drivers' safety say many cabbies
are driving scared these days. Eight drivers have been killed so
far this year, compared with 11 for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like a nightmare,'' said Fernando Mateo, president of
the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers. ''You have not
finished mourning one when you are suddenly arranging for another
wake and funeral procession. When will these killings stop?''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo said Olivares had spoken out about the dangers facing
drivers on the same night he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   '''If I get robbed or I get killed, believe me, I'm going to
take them with me,''' Mateo quoted Olivares as having said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the eight slain cabbies had installed a bulletproof
partition in his car, police said. Olivares had intended to have a
partition installed but had not been able to because the shops that
do that work were swamped with orders, said Eddie Almonte, manager
of Excellent Car Services, where Olivares had worked for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the recent killings, the Taxi and Limousine
Commission voted unanimously last week to require all drivers to
install either bulletproof partitions or digital security cameras
in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the TLC made it mandatory for yellow cabs and livery
cars owned by more than one driver to have the partitions. But cars
owned and operated by individual drivers -- 90 percent of all livery
cars -- could have either partitions or tiny surveillance cameras
installed behind the rearview mirror. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
recently pledged $5 million toward a grant program to help pay for
the security devices.
</P>
<P>
   The recent increase in driver murders and the new requirement
has apparently overwhelmed shops that install partitions, which are
cheaper to install than cameras. Partitions cost between $250 to
$350, and cameras start at $600.
</P>
<P>
   ''My understanding is that there are waiting lists,'' said TLC
spokesman Allan Fromberg. ''They (the shops) are doing the best
they can, they are operating to capacity. Many hundreds of
partitions have been put in already.''

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Petition USDA  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmental groups petitioned the
Agriculture Department today to tighten its regulation of
genetically engineered crops with the contention that the
department has approved new biotech plants without ensuring they
won't harm the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Plants that are made resistant to pests could result in the
development of weeds that are difficult to control or reduce the
genetic diversity of existing crop varieties, the environmental
coalition said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to know a lot more about the impact of these crops
before we introduce them helter-skelter into the environment,''
David Adelman, an attorney for one of the organizations, the
Natural Resources Defense Council, said.
</P>
<P>
   The groups also asked USDA to withdraw approval of two new
varieties of squash that were engineered to resist plant viruses. A
recent study by the National Academy of Sciences questioned whether
the department had considered adequately whether genes from the
squash could spread to weedy relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The department should require more testing and analysis of
biotech crops, depending on the potential environmental risk, the
groups said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the potential risks of these crops nationally and abroad
and the unique role that U.S. regulators play internationally, ...
it is essential that USDA adopt a scientifically sound and
systematic approach to regulating the potential ecological risks
associated with genetically engineered crops,'' the petition said.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic engineering involves transferring one or more genes
between organisms to transfuse specific traits.
</P>
<P>
   USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service regulates
field testing of genetically engineered plants. It later decides
whether they can be released commercially on information provided
by the company about the plant and its potential effects on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We currently have a process for carefully reviewing these
products, but we are always willing to look at new data and ways to
improve the process and will carefully study the petition,'' USDA
spokeswoman Susan McAvoy said.
</P>
<P>
   A former APHIS geneticist, who now represents the biotech
industry, said the department demands sufficient data from
companies to determine whether new crops are safe for the
environment. The department ''does not defer to agribusiness to
decide which tests are necessary,'' said Val Giddings of the
Biotechnology Industry Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The two squash varieties were approved in 1994 and 1996 after
the agency considered fears that the virus-resistant plants would
cross with a wild relative that's a weed and make it hardier.
</P>
<P>
   USDA decided that was unlikely to become a problem, but the
National Academy of Sciences study said longer-term studies were
needed to prove that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Restricting the areas where the squash can be initially grown
would be preferable to unconditional deregulation, at least until
more data are available,'' said the academy's study, which was
released earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Giddings, who worked on the squash approval while at USDA,
conceded the agency ''did not have perfect knowledge'' about its
ecological impact, but ''no one has identified any negative
consequences to the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences study was a broad review of the
government's regulation of pest-protected crops. The academy is
doing a separate study of USDA's regulatory process at the request
of Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to NRDC, other groups signing the petition included
Greenpeace, Sierra Club, Environmental Defense and the Union for
Concerned Scientists.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed in quiet trading
today as investors took a breather after a strong rally on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 13.26 to 11,138.08.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 3.45 to 3,707.78 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 1.15 to 1,478.29.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Dow and the Nasdaq each rose more than 200
points, investors retreated to the sidelines, debating their next
moves. Corporate earnings reports provided the only real spark in
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer edged up 3/8 to 29 7/8. Late Tuesday, the
computer maker reported that excluding gains in its investment
portfolio, first-quarter net income and revenues were virtually
unchanged from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Online auctioneer eBay rose 2 1/8 to 155 11/16. The company's
first-quarter operating results exceeded Wall Street expectations
as the amount of merchandise sold on its site surpassed $1 billion
for the first time. Also, eBay announced plans to split its stock
2-for-1.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of the economy's continued growth came today
from the Commerce Department, which said orders to U.S. factories
for big-ticket manufactured goods rose in March for the first time
this year.
</P>
<P>
   After two straight months of declines, orders for durable goods
-- items expected to last at least three years -- rose 2.6 percent
last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $215.2 billion,
the government reported.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to slow the economy to a more sustainable rate of
growth and keep inflation at bay, the Federal Reserve has raised
interest rates five times since June 30. Given the outlook for
strong continuing growth, many economists believe the Fed will bump
up interest rates again on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 127.21 million
shares, behind Tuesday's early pace.

<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 0.83 to 489.86.

<HEADLINE> Whistleblowers' RICO Suits Limited  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today made it harder for
fired whistleblowers to successfully invoke a federal
anti-racketeering law in suing their former employers.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 7-2 in a Florida case, the justices said people allegedly
harmed by a racketeering conspiracy must prove that an ''overt
act'' that helped the conspiracy was itself a racketeering act.
</P>
<P>
   That means a fired whistleblower cannot cite an allegedly
retaliatory firing to meet the ''overt act'' requirement. Federal
appeals courts had been split on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling potentially is significant because the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, unlike most other federal
laws, offers successful plaintiffs tripled damages.
</P>
<P>
   ''A person may not bring suit under (RICO) for injuries caused
by an overt act that is not an act of racketeering or otherwise
unlawful under the statute,'' Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the
court.
</P>
<P>
   His opinion relied heavily on past rulings in common-law civil
conspiracy cases he said ''support the notion that liability cannot
be imposed unless the overt act that furthered the conspiracy and
harmed the plaintiff was a particular kind of overt act.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed primarily at fighting organized crime, the RICO law has
both criminal and civil provisions. Past Supreme Court decisions --
13 of them in the past 14 years -- have let plaintiffs invoke the
law's civil provisions in a wide variety of disputes, by anyone
allegedly harmed by a ''pattern'' of illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   The law has been invoked to accuse numerous huge corporations of
racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Today's decision in the Florida case was a defeat for Robert A.
Beck II, who in 1983 was hired as president and a director of the
Southeastern Insurance Group, a company whose subsidiaries wrote
bonds for construction companies.
</P>
<P>
   Beck's lawsuit, thrown out by lower courts, said he became aware
in 1988 that other company officials were engaging in misconduct,
such as creating false financial statements and diverting money to
their personal use.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said that after reporting alleged improprieties to
state insurance officials, his performance was criticized and he
was fired. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Beck's lawsuit accused various company officials of violating
the RICO law's conspiracy provisions. But a federal appeals court
said he invoked the wrong law. ''A terminated whistleblower,
although he may have a wrongful-termination claim, has not suffered
an injury that was proximately caused by the defendant's
racketeering activities,'' the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed. The overt act, Thomas wrote, cannot be
''merely the termination of employment.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Beck vs. Prupis, 98-1480.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Giuliani trade charges  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Rudolph Giuliani
should apologize for calling federal agents in the Elian Gonzalez
raid storm troopers.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York City mayor stood by his remarks. His camp
instead attacked the first lady's fund raising, saying Democrats
were trying to hide soft-money donors to her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a new Zogby International poll of voters in
GOP-leaning upstate New York showed the mayor leading the first
lady by 14 percent. The upstate poll showed Giuliani with 52
percent and Clinton with 38 percent. The poll has a margin of error
of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who just signed a civility pledge promising a clean
U.S. Senate campaign, said she agreed with the Federal Law
Enforcement Officers Association, which is demanding an apology
from Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the mayor's inflammatory and divisive rhetoric is
part of a pattern that he has engaged in for quite some time,'' the
first lady said during a campaign stop Tuesday in Westchester
County.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Saturday that the federal government had
''trampled the wishes of (Elian's) mother this morning with guns
and with storm troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   He had this to say Tuesday: ''You do not use loaded automatic
weapons to remove 6-year-old children. Why the attorney general
made the choice to have them dress in battle fatigues and with
automatic weapons that were loaded is a misjudgment of very, very
large proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani added: ''I'm not going to back down from it. ... I've
been in law enforcement a very long time. I've never seen a
situation in which a 6-year-old was removed in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''storm trooper'' remark, he said, ''was meant clearly as a
criticism, and a direct one, of Attorney General Reno and Bill
Clinton'' and was ''not intended as a criticism of the particular
law enforcement officers carrying out the mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's campaign targeted Clinton's fund raising, which has
been a frequent line of attack. This time the campaign was critical
of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's decision not to
immediately disclose soft-money donations to New York Senate 2000,
a committee set up to support Clinton's Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money is not subject to $2,000 campaign donation limits for
individuals. It can be used for issue ads and party-building
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been caught in another of the campaign scams they
imported from Arkansas and perfected in Washington,'' Giuliani
spokeswoman Kim Serafin said of the president and first lady.
</P>
<P>
   DSCC officials said they made an accounting decision not to
detail soft-money donations every month when they file their
reports because the accounting involved was too onerous.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they plan to file those reports when the money is
transferred from a joint fund-raising account set up for the
candidate. New York Senate 2000 raised about $500,000 in soft money
in the first quarter of this year, officials said Tuesday. That is
on top of the roughly $700,000 in soft money raised last year. A
new account set up by Republicans for Giuliani raise nearly
$500,000 in just one month.
</P>
<P>
   DSCC political director Jim Jordan said ''the Clinton campaign
has no control over or knowledge of the administrative
technicalities'' of the account. He asserted the DSCC was following
federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Interfaith Alliance announced that the first lady
had signed its pledge to run a clean campaign. By signing the
group's Framework of Civility for Political Candidates, candidates
promise to avoid personal attacks, take responsibility for the
conduct of advisers and allies and make documentation available for
factual allegations made about opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is also calling on Giuliani to sign the pledge. He
has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush signed the
pledge in December.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 60; Dow Down 43  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in quiet trading today as
investors took a breather after a strong rally on Tuesday.
Technology stocks were mostly higher, buoying the Nasdaq composite
index.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite was
up 60.16 to 3,771.39
</P>
<P>
   Other stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 43.12 to 11,081.70 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 4.59 to 1,481.73.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Dow and the Nasdaq each rose more than 200
points, many investors retreated to the sidelines, debating their
next moves. Corporate earnings reports provided the only real spark
in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer edged up 5/8 to 30 1/8. Late Tuesday, the
computer maker reported that excluding gains in its investment
portfolio, first-quarter net income and revenues were virtually
unchanged from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Online auctioneer eBay rose 1 11/16 to 155 1/4. The company's
first-quarter operating results exceeded Wall Street expectations
as the amount of merchandise sold on its site surpassed $1 billion
for the first time. Also, eBay announced plans to split its stock
2-for-1.
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of technology stocks were higher today. Internet
retail powerhouse Amazon.com gained 4 1/16 to 56 1/2 and Broadcom,
a maker of silicon semiconductors, rose 11 9/16 to 172 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of the economy's continued growth came today
from the Commerce Department, which said orders to U.S. factories
for big-ticket manufactured goods rose in March for the first time
this year.
</P>
<P>
   After two straight months of declines, orders for durable goods
-- items expected to last at least three years -- rose 2.6 percent
last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $215.2 billion,
the government reported.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to slow the economy to a more sustainable rate of
growth and keep inflation at bay, the Federal Reserve has raised
interest rates five times since June 30. Given the outlook for
strong continuing growth, many economists believe the Fed will bump
up interest rates again on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Fed is looking for signs of moderation, they won't find
it'' in the durable goods report, said David Orr, chief economist
at First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were looking ahead to Thursday, when the
government will release first-quarter gross domestic product
figures. Many analysts expect the economy grew at a 6 percent rate
-- too fast for the Fed's comfort, but not as brisk as the 7.3
percent rate posted in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 304.05 million
shares, behind Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 5.90 to 494.93.

<HEADLINE> Almodovar's Roots Lie in La Mancha  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL WOOLLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALZADA DE CALATRAVA, Spain (AP) -- Pedro Almodovar doesn't live
here any more.
</P>
<P>
   The film director's birthplace is a drab little grid of potholes
and dust, the kind of poor farming town that teen-agers can't wait
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's been decades since Almodovar made his home in this
patch of the La Mancha region with a tongue-twister name.
</P>
<P>
   But people here remember him. When the 48-year-old director paid
a rare homecoming visit this month to receive an award, after
winning the Oscar for best foreign film (''All About My Mother''),
the small town square swelled with TV cameras, people and pride.
People on balconies craned their nexks to watch. Rockets burst
overhead in a leaden sky.
</P>
<P>
   A local boy turned big-time director, Almodovar looked the part:
droopy black suit, black shirt, dark glasses, with a white scarf
against the evening chill. A stiff wind tussled his mop of hair.
</P>
<P>
   He confessed, though, that he wore sunglasses not to act cool
but to hide. This was only the second time he had returned since
his mother died here last year at age 83, and the pain was still
raw.
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar says he has fond memories of Calzada de Calatrava, a
town of which there are no postcards, where Solitude Street lies
around the corner from Bitterness Street, where one grocer sells
stale bread as dogfood.
</P>
<P>
   His films may be ultra urban, but beneath it all, he says,
there's a strong influence from La Mancha, his town and its people
-- especially his mother, Francisca.
</P>
<P>
   The strong-willed women who dominate most of his 13 movies, both
comic and tragic, come from her, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''You all knew her,'' Almodovar told the crowd, drawing cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The moral autonomy they have, the strength, the energy to
tackle all the problems they face -- all this comes directly from my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar was born in Calzada de Calatrava, current population
around 5,000, and lived here until he was 8, when his father,
Antonio, a traveling wine salesman, moved the family of six to the
southwest Extremadura region, and eventually to Madrid. Almodovar
Sr. died 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   During the family's time here, the father was often away,
lugging wine on muleback to farms and ranches, sometimes bartering
for produce such as potatoes. His absence, neighbors and family
friends say, meant his wife was left with a prominent role raising
Pedro, his brother and two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   People who knew Pedro as a boy describe him as a chatty, playful
child who bordered on the mischievous. ''He was a real talker. He
was always getting into something,'' says Remedios Alcarcon, 62,
who lived down the street from the Almodovars.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a creative side, too. Felicia Caballero, who lived
across the street and says she changed his diapers more times than
she could count, said her little neighbor developed a thing about
pencils and paper.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'd always find him down on the ground, on his knees,
leaning over and writing or scribbling or drawing,'' said
Caballero, 68.
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar's aunt Cecilia, one of the few surviving relatives of
his parents' generation, agrees he had a soft, reflective streak as
a young man and a weakness for poetry.
</P>
<P>
   People here are fabulously friendly and helpful. A visitor
looking for the squat, red-brick house where Almodovar's mother
lived in her final years is more than likely to be grabbed by the
arm and taken there. Those who knew the Almodovars love to talk
about them, and seem genuinely proud of Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   But even as many beam over his success and revel in the town's
15-minute puff of fame, there's an undercurrent of grumbling among
others, a hushed you-never-come-and-see-us resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar has returned infrequently over the years, mainly
paying quick visits to his mother, and never mixing with locals.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he comes, Pedro tries to keep as low a profile as
possible,'' Mayor Francisco Espinosa says.
</P>
<P>
   One lifetime resident who declined to be named said that until
recently, Almodovar would say only that he was from La Mancha,
never mentioning thoroughly unglamorous Calzada de Calatrava.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that because he left so long ago, Almodovar isn't a
native at all but a city slicker. Yet another gripe is that some of
Almodovar's movie themes, such as sexual bondage, and his
characters, such as transvestites, hold little appeal in a farming
community more concerned with olive prices and weather forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Espinosa, who is among the director's defenders, said that
Almodovar's films have been hits in the town's lone movie theater
and that there is nothing wrong with his preferring privacy when he
comes to town.
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar insists he is a son of La Mancha, the land of Don
Quixote, and does not rule out filming an entire movie there.
</P>
<P>
   So far, many of his films have paid sly homage to the region or
his hometown. For instance, in the 1984 ''What Did I Do to Deserve
This?'', a bus bound for Calzada de Calatrava tries its best but
never quite manages to leave the bus station.
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar disclosed at the homecoming ceremony that he has
received many offers over the years from U.S. movie studios to
shoot a film about Don Quixote. But he couldn't bring himself to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't come to my native region and film a movie in which
Don Quixote, Sancho Panza and Dulcinea speak English,'' Almodovar
said.

<HEADLINE> Kitchen Musical a Hit in S. Korea  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- On stage, four chefs chop, slice and
dice. Bits of cabbage and onions fly. Pots boil, and soon the
savory aroma of vegetables and spices fills the theater.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than culinary tips in the oddball South Korean
musical called ''Nanta,'' or ''Wild Beating.'' The performers beat
knives and kettles, pots and pans -- just about any utensil found in
a kitchen -- to a frenzied, infectious rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   The show is a huge hit in South Korea. Under the title
''Cookin','' it has played well in Tokyo, Disney World in Orlando,
Fla., and Scotland's Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Now, producers are
setting their sights on a New York run.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe our show has a universal appeal because the kitchen
is a natural place for percussion music. There, you can find more
items to beat than anywhere else,'' says director Choi Chul-ki, 28.
</P>
<P>
   Nanta echoes ''Stomp,'' the off-Broadway hit in which performers
fashion music with flotsam found on city streets.
</P>
<P>
   But while ''Stomp'' is built around a distinctive urban beat,
''Nanta'' borrows its heart-thumping rhythms from Korea's lively --
but fading -- traditional farmers' percussive music.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, anthropologists reported a rhythm distinctive of
Korea when rural housewives ironed starched clothes by laying them
on a stone block and pounding away with a pair of round sticks.
Similar beats were heard when workers chopped with knives while
preparing a village feast.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of the 80-minute musical is simple. A restaurant
manager gives his three wacky chefs one hour to prepare a wedding
banquet with the help, or handicap, of the manager's bumbling
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in loose traditional cotton outfits, the chefs make a
solemn bow before a gargoyle-like Korean kitchen god. Then they sit
and tease delicate beats out of rice bowls with chopsticks and
spoons.
</P>
<P>
   When the show gets rolling, however, the cooks appear in
sleeveless T-shirts and barrel through rhythms with cleavers and
knives on chopping blocks, water-cooler bottles and trash cans at a
speed that would put the fast-slicing chefs at teppanyaki
restaurants to shame.
</P>
<P>
   Butcher knives flash in strobes. Vegetables fly everywhere,
sometimes into spectators' laps. A rock band booms.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was especially difficult to find rhythms with kitchen
gadgets because they did not have the kind of elasticity that
traditional instruments have,'' says Cho Hae-sun, 29, who plays a
chef.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nanta'' is a stark departure from traditional Korean musicals
that emphasize grace and decorum. Ancient Korean nobles stressed
the delicate ritual of cuisine, and they celebrated with musicians
who twanged sleepy tunes on zithers, spinning out oration that
could last hours.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ''Nanta'' gets inspiration from a different crowd --
irreverent tenants who celebrated autumn harvests with vulgar
clowning, punchy jokes at landlords, and crudely built drums and
gongs. True to that tradition, ''Nanta'' adds a hearty helping of
circus and slapstick comedy. Chefs juggle dishes, breathe fire and
joust with broom sticks.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, two chefs argue over who should dispose of the
trash. The rubbish bag lands in the laps of people sitting in the
most expensive seats of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nanta'' debuted in late 1997 and has attracted 350,000 viewers
to become one of the longest-running shows in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out with four performers, the show has recruited 10
more young actors so that more than three performances can be
staged simultaneously at different locations.
</P>
<P>
   In May, ''Nanta'' will start touring in Asia, Europe and the
United States. The musical's creator, PMC Whan Performance, is
negotiating to take the musical to New York early next year.

<HEADLINE> Life of Amy Irving, Bruno Barreto  </HEADLINE>
By MARK KENNEDY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The table is loaded with cold pate, lukewarm
steak tartar and chilled arugula salad. The sizzle is provided by
Amy Irving and her husband Bruno Barreto.
</P>
<P>
   She's the Oscar-nominated actress with the tangle of golden
curls; he's the acclaimed Brazilian filmmaker with very little
hair. Amy's the quiet one, Bruno's the type-A, waving his arms
about and restless.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a very volatile couple,'' Irving says. ''It's been 11
years, so I think this is the way we are. Men and women -- that's
hard enough, but when you have two different cultures?''
</P>
<P>
   Fire and ice -- hence the sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch at an upscale bistro, the couple spar playfully as
they discuss their latest -- and third -- film together, ''Bossa
Nova,'' a quirky romantic comedy that mines their kind of humor:
culture clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The film, set in Rio de Janeiro, features nine oddball
characters who miscommunicate, fall in love and generally just
blunder about. Director Barreto calls it a ''valentine to Amy and
to Rio.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This came straight from what's going on in my life. I just
turned 45 and I really think that there is glamour after 40 -- you
can be sexy, you can be romantic, you can be attractive,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   With a mouthful of salad, Irving, 46, nods her head.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought that I'd be starring in a romantic comedy at
my age. That's been a real big kick in the pants for me. Woman over
40? It's a tough situation,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's career has ranged from starring in ''Yentl,''
''Carrie'' and ''Crossing Delancey'' to supplying the singing voice
for a sexy cartoon rabbit in ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''
</P>
<P>
   But she's perhaps most famous for her marriage and messy 1989
divorce from director Steven Spielberg. Irving walked away with
millions -- then vanished into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had said that I wanted to retire, but I think that was
basically because I didn't want to feel rejected by the industry
.... I don't really ever want to retire -- I love acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Barreto, meanwhile, was making a name with ''Dona Flor and Her
Two Husbands,'' ''Gabriela'' and ''Story of Fausta.'' More
recently, he earned a foreign film Oscar nomination for ''Four Days
in September.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple met at lunch -- where else? -- while Barreto was eyeing
her for the lead in ''A Show of Force,'' his 1990 American
directorial debut. He was smitten; she was hired.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both of us left that lunch thinking, 'OK, we're out of here!'
We were both attracted to each other but we had a job to do,''
Irving recalls. ''He was thinking, 'I'm not going to get involved
with my actress.' I thought, 'I'm not going to get involved with my
director.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''It took about 10 days into the shoot for us to not be able to
listen to that little voice anymore,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Love sprang up, even if the film fizzled at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't concentrate on what you're doing if you're falling
in love,'' Irving says. ''Probably the film would have been better
had we not fallen in love. It kinda took precedence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll never happen again,'' says Barreto, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, they're gazing at each other with the mushiness that comes
from a kind of new honeymoon -- they actually like working together.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we're shooting, it's always a very romantic time for us
because we do fall deeply in love again,'' she says. ''The home
dynamic, when we're not working together, that's when the culture
clash happens and the fights start.''
</P>
<P>
   Barreto agrees. ''So we should work together as much as
possible,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah,'' Amy says in a singsongy voice. ''Find me a movie,
honey.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunch winding down, their differences re-emerge. He harasses the
waiters about details of a praline-filled caramel tort; she doesn't
make a peep, even when a hair is found floating in her tea.
</P>
<P>
   Irving admits to being neurotically early; Barreto confesses
he's neurotically late. Ultimately, the biggest crime she accuses
him of is tunnel-vision, a trait she's found in other directors,
including Spielberg and her father, Jules Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Barreto pleads guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ''When someone decides to earn a living making films, it is
very, very hard,'' he says. ''I think it's because one has a huge
need to make life perfect and better and more harmonious. You're
recreating life the way you want life to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A little bit of a control freak there?'' Irving teases.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's true,'' Barreto acknowledges. ''It's a different way of
saying control freak, but I think if you are a control freak, it's
a good way of channeling what could be a neurosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving shoots him a look.
</P>
<P>
   ''What IS a neurosis,'' he corrects himself.

<HEADLINE> The Return of the Shaggs  </HEADLINE>
By HOLLY RAMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EPPING, N.H. (AP) -- After all these years, Dot Semprini can't
shake The Shaggs.
</P>
<P>
   She's busy enough -- at 51, she has two teen-age sons, makes a
living cleaning houses and working at a day-care center, and tries
to make it to church every week.
</P>
<P>
   But 30 years ago, she was Dot Wiggin, lead singer of The Shaggs
-- a band driven more by her father's stubbornness than by musical
talent. And that now-defunct band has been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Dot and her sisters Betty and Helen started with gigs at the
Fremont Town Hall and a nearby nursing home. Today, they get fan
mail from around the world, and their lawyers are negotiating a
possible movie deal.
</P>
<P>
   The story in between is like the band's music: sometimes sweet,
sometimes painful, and always unforgettable. It's a story of three
sisters, two records, a cat named Foot Foot and, finally, fame.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost like we lived two lives: That was then, this is
now,'' Semprini says. ''Only the then is becoming the now.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The idea of The Shaggs is actually older than Semprini and her
sisters. When their father was young, his mother made three
predictions: He'd marry a strawberry blonde, have two sons she
would not live to see, and watch his daughters play in a band.
</P>
<P>
   The first two parts of the fortune came true, and Austin Wiggin
was determined to bring about the third. In the mid-1960s, he
pulled his daughters out of school and bought them instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we would've thought about it if he didn't come
up with the idea first, but we thought it was a good idea,''
Semprini said in a recent interview in Epping, where the three
sisters now live. ''We always liked music.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from weekly trips to Manchester for music lessons, they
rarely left the small town of Fremont. The next few years blurred
into one long day: a few hours of schoolwork from a mail-order
company, morning music practice, afternoon music practice,
calisthenics. Sometimes they set up their instruments in the living
room, but mostly they played in the concrete-walled,
concrete-floored basement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then when our father came home from work, we'd practice for
him before supper, and sometimes after supper, depending on how it
went,'' Semprini said. ''That pretty much took care of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The routine changed in 1968 when Austin Wiggin arranged for the
girls to play at the Fremont Town Hall every Saturday night. Their
two brothers helped them lug their speakers and drum set up the
stairs to the performance venue, where the Shaggs (named by their
father for their long, shaggy hairstyles) played cover songs and
their own arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember those (nights) as fun,'' Semprini said. ''There
were some kids who might poke fun or say mean things, but not a
whole lot. We'd mingle during intermissions with some of the kids
we knew from town.''
</P>
<P>
   The following year, they recorded their first album in a Revere,
Mass., studio. The Shaggs, then ages 18 to 22, were reluctant, but
their father was firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to get them while they're hot,'' he reportedly told the
sound engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Betty, now Betty Porter and a 49-year-old widow who works at a
kitchen equipment warehouse, said she and her sisters struggled
during that long day at the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't think we were ready to record anything,'' she said.
''There was one song we had to keep going over and over and over
again. ... I remember getting tired and thinking 'When are we gonna
be done?'''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like the practices night after night,'' Semprini said.
''You'd almost hope something would come up so you could get out of
practicing for one night.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   By the end of that day, they had recorded the 12 songs that
would become ''Philosophy of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs' subjects (parents, a cat, Halloween) and lyrics
(''I'm so happy when you're near/ I'm so sad when you're away'')
were simple enough. But the sound was something else. The girls
plodded or raced through the songs, painfully out of tune and off
beat, lurching from chord to chord with the drums rattling in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Their hopes of stardom dwindled when the man who agreed to press
and distribute 1,000 copies disappeared with 900 of them. The rest
were circulated to New England radio stations, but attracted little
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Wiggin was undeterred. The Shaggs were back in the studio
a few years later to record a few more songs.
</P>
<P>
   He was strict, but supportive, Semprini said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was old-fashioned. He knew what he wanted and there was no
two ways about the way it was going to be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wanted the best for us and wanted to do everything
possible,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   They admit he had a temper, however. Helen eloped at 28, but
lived at home for several months, afraid to tell her father what
she had done. One of her husband's co-workers told on them before
they could break the news, Semprini said. Their father was furious,
at first.
</P>
<P>
   ''He basically told Helen, 'You're married, go live with him,'''
she said. ''He kicked Helen out of the band, but we weren't really
doing a whole lot then anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen eventually rejoined the group, but it had already begun to
deflate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, their father died of a heart attack. The Shaggs died
along with him.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   But while the Wiggin sisters went on with their lives -- got
married, had children, moved to another small New Hampshire town --
those 100 records slowly attracted a cult following.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston radio station played a few of the songs in the 1970s. A
band called NRBQ got its record label to re-release ''Philosophy of
the World'' on vinyl in 1980. Eight years later, they combined
tracks from both recording sessions on a CD called ''The Shaggs.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zappa called the Shaggs ''better than the Beatles.'' In
1996, Rolling Stone named the album one of the 100 ''most
influential alternative releases of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, RCA Victor re-released ''Philosophy of the World.''
And in December, Tom Cruise's production company, Cruise/Wagner
Productions, optioned a story about the band that had appeared in
The New Yorker. A spokesman for the company said it's too early to
talk about the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Chusid, who produced the latest CD, devotes a chapter to
the Shaggs in his book, ''Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious
Universe of Outsider Music.'' He praises the Shaggs for their
''honest artistic expression of their musical impulses.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's aboriginal rock and roll. It's musical primitivism. It's
three girls stumbling across the lost chords,'' he said. ''There's
a spastic magic in those grooves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shaggs even showed up in a scholarly paper by Guy Capuzzo, a
music theory professor at Penn State, written when he was a
graduate student. He says he was drawn to the Shaggs because they
remind him of what musicians sound like when they first start out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of like a balloon that's just about to burst.
There's this enormous tension. ... Two of them will be playing at
one tempo, the other one is playing at another tempo. You're
waiting for the whole thing to fall apart, but it doesn't,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You start to think they're just going to train-wreck, but
somehow they get it back together.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Shaggs literally got back together in December, when their
friends from NRBQ persuaded them to do two shows in New York --
their first in 30 years and their first ever outside New Hampshire.
Helen, who suffers from depression, decided not to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was $100 a week to rent two guitars, and we really couldn't
afford more than that. So we just said we'll take the week and do
the best we can,'' Semprini said. ''We couldn't play 'em like we
played 'em then. I really don't know how I wrote them, never mind
play them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We winged our way through it,'' Porter said. ''We weren't
ready the first time, and we weren't ready this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Both were amazed to meet fans who could sing along with all
their songs. One woman showed up wearing a T-shirt printed with a
drawing of Foot Foot, the cat they sing about in ''My Pal Foot
Foot.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad we did it,'' Semprini said. ''Not so much for what we
did, but for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   But The Shaggs also have their critics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shock therapy and all the Prozac in the world would never stop
the haunting sounds of these banshees,'' one reviewer wrote on a
music Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see a lot of the garbage on the Internet,'' Semprini said.
She laughs at the attacks, but admits she has toyed with the idea
of creating her own site to defend herself. On it, she would
explain her philosophy of life, which she boils down to two rules.
First, don't judge others until you've walked a mile in their
shoes. Second, from the Disney movie ''Bambi'':
</P>
<P>
   ''Just like Bambi's mother always told Bambi, if you can't say
anything nice, don't say nothing at all,'' she said. ''Everyone is
entitled to their true opinion, but some of them could be a little
nicer in how they say it.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Shaggs don't spend much time dreaming about what might have
happened if they had continued performing. They realize that part
of their allure lies in the brevity of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd almost dare to say that we wouldn't be as popular now if
we had kept going,'' Semprini said. ''I don't know if we ever
would've got big enough to go on tours. I just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's face it,'' Porter cuts in. ''As we got going we would've
gotten better, and it seems as though people don't want it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Shaggs draw strong reactions from listeners, who either put
them on a pedestal or want to crush them with one:
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Thames features the group about once a month on his
Houston radio show ''Sound Awake.'' His advice to first-time
listeners: Step away from the car. Thames made the mistake of
driving when he first heard the Shaggs' CD, and nearly had a wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ''About eight seconds into 'I'm so Happy When You're Near' I was
just laughing hysterically,'' he said. ''I tell people, 'Don't
listen to this in the car.'''
</P>
<P>
   He liked the band immediately, but it wasn't until a few years
later that he became a ''raging Shagg-a-holic.'' He's received a
few ''What on earth was that?'' calls from listeners, but he urges
them to give The Shaggs a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are definitely bands I've heard that are better, but
they are the most truly original band I'll ever lay ears on,'' he
said. ''Long may they reign.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Of the two dozen people who have submitted reviews on the
Amazon.com Web site after buying the CD, about half hated it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why won't it let me assign this album negative three stars?''
lamented a reviewer identified only as ''the Enigma'' from South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Friends warned him against buying the CD, but he didn't listen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh my God, do I regret my decision,'' the reviewer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Another gave the album three stars for: ''1. The feeling of
nausea and motion sickness. 2. The bad dreams. 3. The temporary
loss of sanity I experienced when I decided I'd rather have my ears
removed than have to listen to another moment of their mismatched
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Shaggs so inspired San Francisco caterer Aloma Julian that
she named her cat Foot Foot. Julian, who first heard The Shaggs in
1976, is on her fourth copy of the record, having worn out the
first three with frequent playing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they were the worst band I ever heard, but I loved
them for it. I liked the fact they were all girls,'' she said.
''And I had never read a sweeter set of liner notes in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   She claims to have converted hundreds of skeptics into fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to have a lot of loft parties, and we'd always make
dance tapes. People love it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Julian scolds those who can't make it past the first song on the
album, ''Philosophy of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have to listen to 'My Pal Foot Foot,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The ode to Dot's lost cat (''My pal's name is Foot Foot/ He
always likes to roam/ My pal's name is Foot Foot/ I never find him
home), elicits particularly strong reactions:
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because something like 'My Pal Foot Foot' will be
tattooed on your brain after listening, doesn't make it WORTH
listening to,'' said one Internet reviewer. ''I like the idea of
keeping it around as a stocking stuffer, but it will bring on the
worst hangover you've ever had within 30 seconds, irregardless if
you've been drinking.''

<HEADLINE> Helms To Block Arms-Control Deals  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms pledged today to block any
arms-control agreement that President Clinton might negotiate with
Russia in the closing months of his term.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not on my watch, Mr. President. It's not going to happen,''
Helms, R-N.C., who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
said in a Senate speech.
</P>
<P>
   Helms said that he is fearful Clinton wants to conclude an
arms-reduction agreement with Moscow as part of his legacy as
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a few months the American people will go to the polls to
elect a new president -- a president who must have a clean break
from the failed policies of this administration,'' Helms said. ''He
must have the freedom and the flexibility to establish his own
security policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration wants to amend the landmark 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to build a limited missile-defense
system. Moscow has vehemently opposed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   However, the recent approval by Russian legislators of two
arms-control accords helped fuel optimism in the administration for
a new round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   But, Helms told the Senate, ''It is my intent to do everything
in my power to ensure that nothing is done in the next few months
by this administration to tie the hands of the next administration
in pursuing a new national security policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Helms said his panel would not hold hearings or
consider in any way any renegotiated ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's be clear to avoid any misunderstanding down the line.
Any modified ABM treaty negotiated by this administration will be
DOA, dead on arrival, at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,''
Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   Helms has long considered the ABM treaty null and void, anyway,
on grounds that it was negotiated with the Soviet Union, which no
longer exists. It is a view shared by many conservatives, but not
by the administration or most arms-control analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Helms has tied up treaties before. He bottled up the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for years before the Senate finally
took it up last fall -- and rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Defense Secretary William Cohen told the Senate
Appropriations Committee that he still intends to make a
recommendation this summer to Clinton on whether to proceed with
deployment of a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ABM treaty, Cohen said the administration still
intends to negotiate with the Russians ''and see whether or not we
can amend the ABM treaty to take into account a national missile
defense if the president should choose to go forward.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 107; Nasdaq Down 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower today as investors
took a breather after a strong rally on Tuesday. Technology stocks
were holding up better than the broad market.
</P>
<P>
   In midday on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite was down 3.20 to
3,708.03
</P>
<P>
   Other stock indicators were lower. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 107.65 to 11,017.17 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 4.27 to 1,472.87.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Dow and the Nasdaq each rose more than 200
points, many investors retreated to the sidelines, debating their
next moves. Corporate earnings reports provided the only real spark
in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer edged up 7/16 to 29 15/16. Late Tuesday, the
computer maker reported that excluding gains in its investment
portfolio, first-quarter net income and revenues were virtually
unchanged from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Online auctioneer eBay gave up early gains and was down 2 11/16
to 150 7/8. The company's first-quarter operating results exceeded
Wall Street expectations as the amount of merchandise sold on its
site surpassed $1 billion for the first time. Also, eBay announced
plans to split its stock 2-for-1.
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of technology stocks were higher today. Internet
retail powerhouse Amazon.com gained 2 11/16 to 55 1/8 and Broadcom,
a maker of silicon semiconductors, rose 1 3/16 to 162 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of the economy's continued growth came today
from the Commerce Department, which said orders to U.S. factories
for big-ticket manufactured goods rose in March for the first time
this year.
</P>
<P>
   After two straight months of declines, orders for durable goods
-- items expected to last at least three years -- rose 2.6 percent
last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $215.2 billion,
the government reported.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to slow the economy to a more sustainable rate of
growth and keep inflation at bay, the Federal Reserve has raised
interest rates five times since June 30. Given the outlook for
strong continuing growth, many economists believe the Fed will bump
up interest rates again on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Fed is looking for signs of moderation, they won't find
it'' in the durable goods report, said David Orr, chief economist
at First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were looking ahead to Thursday, when the
government will release first-quarter gross domestic product
figures. Many analysts expect the economy grew at a 6 percent rate
-- too fast for the Fed's comfort, but not as brisk as the 7.3
percent rate posted in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about rising interest rates weighed on
financial-services stocks. American Express fell 2 1/8 to 155 7/8
and J.P. Morgan fell 2 5/16 to 135 5/8, weighing most heavily on
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 453.39 million
shares, behind Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 0.92 to 489.95.

<HEADLINE> Missile Shield Could Cost $60B  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A national missile shield that would offer
limited protection from attack by smaller, newly armed countries
would cost almost $60 billion through 2015, the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office says.
</P>
<P>
   A CBO report released Tuesday said that's how much would be
needed to defend the country from attack by a relatively small
number of incoming ballistic missiles. It said those missiles could
contain nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, capable of killing
millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   The report cautioned that many still believe hostile countries
just developing long-range missiles, such as North Korea or Iran,
could find easy ways to outmaneuver the proposed defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $60 billion price tag, Defense Secretary William Cohen
told a Senate hearing today ''I have no way of knowing whether
those numbers are accurate, or what they've included.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many items that would make up such a system were ''open
to resolution,'' including decisions on such items as how many
satellites would be included.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that he is prepared to make a recommendation to
President Clinton this summer -- the schedule the administration has
set -- on whether to commit toward deployment of a specific system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do we have the technology? We have not resolved that issue
yet,'' Cohen said. ''We're close, but I think that the tests that
are forthcoming will give us the ability to make that
determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who
requested the report with Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., said it made clear that the criteria of cost,
operability, effect on national security and impact on arms
reduction efforts can't be ignored in deciding whether to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is far too soon to evaluate the overall feasibility or
advisability of the missile defense project,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a chief proponent of a missile
defense system, said the CBO estimate was far too high and has ''no
basis in reality.'' ''You can't put a price on protecting American
cities,'' Weldon said, but $60 billion was ''totally out of line,
out of synch with anything I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year passed by large majorities, and President
Clinton signed, a bill stating it is the policy of the United
States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, a system
capable of defending U.S. territory against limited ballistic
missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The program has had problems with test failures and has met
strong opposition from nuclear powers such as Russia and China.
Russia says it would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
and threatened to pull out of other arms-reduction pacts if the
United States builds the system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to decide this fall, after another Pentagon test of
the system in June, whether to continue with plans to have it
operating by a target date of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO said the first phase of a national missile defense would
cost $29.5 billion through 2015, $3.9 billion more than the
administration has estimated.
</P>
<P>
   It would include locating 100 interceptors in central Alaska,
constructing a high-resolution X-band radar and upgrading several
existing early-warning radars.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase, to be deployed by 2010 under current plans,
would use satellites that could track not only powered-flight
missiles but also missiles gliding through space. The third phase
would add 150 interceptors, some at a second site currently planned
for Grand Forks, N. D.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has not yet estimated the cost of the last
two phases. The CBO said the second phase would cost another $6.1
billion and the third phase $13.3 billion through 2015. It said
another $10.6 billion would be needed for space-based sensors,
satellites that share have other missions with support of missile
defense.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Peter Facinelli  </HEADLINE>
By ELIZABETH A. KENNEDY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Growing up in Queens, N.Y., Peter Facinelli
wanted to be a lawyer until he realized one thing: ''I think I have
an allergic reaction to suits.''
</P>
<P>
   This problem did not interfere with his impressive performance
as a young, straight-laced industrial lubricant salesman in the new
movie ''The Big Kahuna,'' which also stars Kevin Spacey and Danny
DeVito.
</P>
<P>
   Facinelli plays Bob. He and co-workers Larry (Spacey) and Phil
(DeVito) await the arrival of an important potential client at a
trade convention. Over the course of one night, the three salesmen
open up to each other and reveal some powerful conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   His previous film roles include ''Can't Hardly Wait'' and
''Dancer, Texas Pop. 81.'' But ''The Big Kahuna'' stands out for
the 26-year-old actor, who describes the screenplay as ''very
complex'' and ''some of the best writing I had ever read.''
</P>
<P>
   Facinelli lives in Los Angeles with his girlfriend Jennie Garth
(''Beverly Hills, 90210'') and their 2-year-old daughter Luca
Bella.
</P>
<P>
   But he enjoys coming back to New York to visit his family and to
savor the city's ''wonderful creative atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember when I was studying acting at New York University.
When I came out of class into Washington Square Park, there were
all these students writing poetry and painting. I like that
mosh-posh of different cultures and people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a night of karaoke in downtown Manhattan -- where he sang
Elvis Presley's ''Hound Dog'' -- Facinelli sat down to talk about
his new film.
</P>
<P>
   1. The character you play in ''The Big Kahuna'' is a strict
Christian who thinks it is important that others know what he
believes. Do you think it's important that people know your
beliefs?
</P>
<P>
   Facinelli: No, I don't. For me, I have a set of beliefs and my
rules that I live by. I try not to come from a judgmental place, so
I don't try to instill them on other people. Everyone has to do
their own thing. Everybody strives for goodness. I wouldn't want to
tell people how to get there.
</P>
<P>
   2. Your co-stars are established Hollywood actors. Did you feel
intimidated working with Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito?
</P>
<P>
   Facinelli: I don't really get star-struck because I feel like
we're all trying to do the same thing. But I have a lot of respect
for Kevin and Danny, so I was excited. I was fully aware that they
are very powerful actors, and that I really have to try to keep up
with them.
</P>
<P>
   3. Do you and Jennie Garth ever talk about work when you're at
home?
</P>
<P>
   Facinelli: No, we don't talk about business. We talk about our
day. Acting is like any other occupation; you go home and talk
about your day. But we both do the same thing, so it's not like one
of us is trying to impress the other. But we support each other.
</P>
<P>
   4. Your daughter was born when you were 23. Was it strange to
become a father at such a young age?
</P>
<P>
   Facinelli: Yeah, definitely! When she calls me dad, sometimes I
look around the room to see who she's talking to. It's a little
weird because you don't really think of yourself as a dad, you
think of your own dad as a dad. But they don't have instruction
books for parents, so you just have to learn by experience. Having
a child helps me with my acting, too. That's what we're trying to
do, as actors, to be as free as a little kid.
</P>
<P>
   4{. How did you come up with the name Luca Bella for your
daughter? Is it a nod to your Italian heritage?
</P>
<P>
   Facinelli: I'm a first-generation American. My family came from
Italy, so it is an Italian name. My uncle's name was Luca, which
means 'light.' It's a male name, but I used it for my daughter
because I liked it, and Bella we added because it means
'beautiful,' so the full name means 'beautiful light.'
</P>
<P>
   5. What's next for Peter Facinelli?
</P>
<P>
   Facinelli: I'm going to the Caribbean islands for a few days. I
need a vacation. I haven't had one in two years.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Jim Caviezel  </HEADLINE>
By CAROL DEEGAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In ''Frequency,'' Gregory Hoblit's new
time-travel thriller, Jim Caviezel plays John Sullivan, a young cop
whose father was killed in a fire 30 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Everything changes when a spectacular sky storm allows father
and son to communicate by ham radio through time. Sullivan is able
to warn his father about the mistake that cost him his life. But
saving his father's life alters events leading from 1969 to 1999,
with tragic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel, 31, is so thoroughly believable as Sullivan that it
takes a moment to adjust to the notion that the soft-spoken actor
with the gentle drawl is the same person who plays New York City
firefighter Dennis Quaid's son in the film.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, there is no trace of the fiery, tormented Sullivan
in Caviezel (pronounced Kuh-vee-zuhl). Even his features seem
different: softer, less angular. He is gracious and polite, and his
manner is quiet and understated.
</P>
<P>
   A native of rural Washington, Caviezel wanted to be a pro
basketball player. After suffering a foot injury, he took the
discipline and the ability to endure failure that he learned in
basketball -- ''I never had the talent to play the game at all'' --
and applied it to acting.
</P>
<P>
   His uncanny ability to mimic other people also helps.
</P>
<P>
   The character of John Sullivan grew up in Queens, N.Y., which
meant Caviezel had to learn to speak with a Queens accent.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was probably the most nerve-racking part of (making the
film). 'Can I get it? Do I have enough time?' 'Cause I only had
like two weeks before the film started to absorb it, and luckily
because of my experience of impersonating people, I was able to
acquire that skill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His acting career began with a small part in the 1991 film ''My
Own Private Idaho.'' (He landed the role of an airline clerk by
fooling casting agents into believing he was a recent Italian
immigrant.) He appeared in a handful of other films, including
''Diggstown,'' ''Wyatt Earp,'' ''The Rock'' and ''G.I. Jane,''
before winning critical acclaim in Terrence Malick's ''The Thin Red
Line.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently appeared in Ang Lee's ''Ride With the Devil.'' His
upcoming films include ''Madison,'' a true story about the
economically depressed community of Madison, Ind., and the town's
desire to win a Gold Cup hydroplane race.
</P>
<P>
   1. Did you always have the acting bug?
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel: No. Never had it. I did voice impersonations growin'
up, but all I did was play basketball. That's what my goal was.
Then I tore my foot up.
</P>
<P>
   2. You were very serious about basketball, weren't you?
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel: I wanted to play in the NBA so bad. I went to camps
all summer long. I was always seen with a basketball. My fingers
were always cut up 'cause of the wear of the ball on my fingers
during the hot summer days of playing on the pavement. My whole
room was completely covered in sports, everything.
</P>
<P>
   3. Why do you compare your upcoming film ''Madison'' to the
basketball film ''Hoosiers''?
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel: It's like 'Hoosiers' on water is what it is. ... It's
about the Gold Cup race and this guy, what he was willing to
sacrifice, and this town, they supported their own boat and they
still do. They compete against ... Budweiser, all the big
companies, and this town scratches money together and puts their
boat on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   4. What were your feelings when you saw ''Frequency'' for the
first time?
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel: I was proud of the film. I just love the film. ...
It's got so many things that you can relate to. ... It's your love
for something and what you are willing to do in that moment to save
that person's life or speak your mind about something and not
quitting, and so I recognize that in John Sullivan, and how much
that I love my own father and mother.
</P>
<P>
   5. What drew you to the film?
</P>
<P>
   Caviezel: What drew me to the 'Frequency' script was the
father-son story. ... I'm very close to my dad. ... And that was
carried through in the film. In the scenes where I'm talking to my
father, there was nothing written in there that said, 'OK, John
Sullivan gets very emotional here.' It just happened, which gave a
real quality to the story.

<HEADLINE> Coby Bell on Cusp of Celebrity  </HEADLINE>
By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nice guys don't always finish last.
</P>
<P>
   Coby Bell, one of the stars of NBC's ensemble drama ''Third
Watch,'' is a young actor who has skyrocketed to the cusp of
celebrity. But that hasn't changed his mantra: ''Take it easy, go
with the flow and be nice to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after graduating with honors from San Jose State
University, Bell landed a guest role on ''ER,'' which led to guest
spots on ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' ''The Parent 'Hood'' and
other TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Bell was tapped as a full-fledged cast member on ''LA Doctors''
in 1998. Within weeks of learning that his character was being
phased out, he won the part of rookie cop Ty Davis Jr. on ''Third
Watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it's not that easy. I know that's not how the business
works for most people. But it worked for me and I don't question
it,'' said Bell, who has relocated from his native Southern
California to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Third Watch'' follows a tightknit group of New York City
police officers, firefighters and paramedics through their tours of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right when I read the character, I knew it was for me,'' he
said. ''Everything is new for him as he starts on a new part of his
life, and that's just where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell and his alter ego try to live by the rules. ''I try to be a
good guy, he tries to be a good guy. I try to be a nice guy, and he
tries to be a nice guy,'' the 24-year-old actor explained.
</P>
<P>
   ''Third Watch'' is filmed on location throughout the city, and
Bell is enjoying every minute of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''We film 90 percent of the scenes on the street, and we get a
pretty cool reaction from people, especially when we're in our
uniforms. If they realize we're 'Third Watch,' people cheer. Or
they think I'm a real cop and they ask me for directions.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a ''good vibe'' on the set, said Bell, and the actors
are off-camera friends. But, he added, when a recent scene called
for a competitive basketball game among cast members, a heavy dose
of ''machismo'' filled the Harlem YMCA gymnasium. The 6-foot-4-inch
Bell held his own on the basketball court, sinking 12 consecutive
shots during rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Bell joked that because of the show's many action scenes, the
casting director should have made physical fitness a requirement
for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an NYPD uniform and chasing pretend criminals down
crowded streets has given Bell a much greater appreciation for the
job that police officers do, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He calls police work ''noble'' -- and too difficult for him to
ever consider.
</P>
<P>
   '''Third Watch' is a dream job. I love to go to work every
day,'' he said. ''I just wish everyone would see the show. I think
it's that good.''
</P>
<P>
   People are beginning to recognize him as a TV star -- sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ''They usually say, 'You look just like that guy from 'Third
Watch,' but you have glasses,''' said Bell, who wears corrective
glasses for astigmatism when he's not filming.
</P>
<P>
   It's strange and awkward to be asked for an autograph, Bell
said, but he sees it as a huge compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, the son of a Broadway stage actor, chose television, radio
and film production as his major in college. He knew he wanted to
work in the entertainment field, but was realistic about the
competitiveness for on-camera roles.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a theater department professor persuaded him to take
a leading role in a stage production of ''The Grapes of Wrath,''
and after that, his mind was made up.
</P>
<P>
   When he's not working, Bell enjoys getting together with ''Third
Watch'' co-stars Anthony Ruivivar, Skipp Sudduth and Jason Wiles,
or relaxing on his couch and watching reruns of ''Gilligan's
Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell loves music. He plays keyboards, guitar and drums. He's
learning how to play the bass -- and has callused fingers to prove
it. He owns a saxophone, but his apartment isn't soundproof enough
for him to practice.

<HEADLINE> Screamin' Jay Hawkins Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- His biographer says Screamin' Jay Hawkins spent
his life looking for romance.
</P>
<P>
   Screamin' Jay had more success than most.
</P>
<P>
   The voice behind the seminal '50s rock howler ''I Put a Spell on
You'' claimed to have fathered 57 children before dying Feb. 12 at
70. That's just an estimate; Hawkins acknowledged there could be a
few more wandering about.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very active in the ladies' department,'' said his
biographer Maral Nigolian, as understated as Hawkins was oversexed.
''He was a handsome, vibrant musician, a very charismatic
persona.''
</P>
<P>
   That charisma has prompted a Web site aimed at tracking down his
prodigious progeny -- an effort that has drawn nearly 70 responses
from around the United States since it went online March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins lost touch with his children -- those he knew about --
after moving to Paris in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   How impressive is Hawkins' total? Rolling Stone Mick Jagger,
rock icon of the last four decades, acknowledged siring just seven
children.
</P>
<P>
   At www.jayskids.com, the message is succinct: ''If you believe
you may have had a child by Screamin' Jay Hawkins, or if you
believe you are a child of Screamin' Jay Hawkins, please click
here.''
</P>
<P>
   That sound you hear is hundreds upon hundreds of mouse clicks.
On its busiest day, the site racked up 12,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nigolian, at least eight of the respondents seem
legitimate heirs, based on information that Hawkins provided during
a series of conversations. The others will require additional
investigation; ultimately, DNA testing will determine who is and
who isn't an actual Screamin' son or daughter.
</P>
<P>
   During a singing career that spanned nearly 50 years, Hawkins
was married six times and enjoyed uncounted liaisons. His widow,
who lived with Hawkins in France, was apparently unaware of his
previous wives and knew little about his endless heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins died of multiple organ failure following emergency
surgery for an aneurysm. He was buried in Pere-Lachaise in Paris,
the same cemetery as Doors frontman Jim Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   The estate is saying nothing about any children until they are
actually approved as offspring of the rock 'n' roll Wilt
Chamberlain. But in excerpts from some of the e-mails received
through the Web site, it's clear that Screamin' Jay got around.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he had relatives in (Washington) D.C., and believe that
around the time of my conception he was here,'' offered one
possible child.
</P>
<P>
   Wrote another, ''My mamma was a waitress in a Detroit diner when
she met Hawkins.''
</P>
<P>
   A third, writing from Cleveland, picked up some paternal clues
from his mother's musical taste.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that my mother was a HUGE fan of Mr. Hawkins. ... She
had met him on many occasions and kept a picture of herself and Jay
framed on the wall,'' he wrote. ''I just want to trace my blood
lines and find out where I am from.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' desire to track down his kids had a simple motivation:
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was something he regretted -- there was never enough time
to spend with his kids,'' Nigolian said. ''But he never regretted
having them. He was very proud of his kids.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of pride.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins was always a larger-than-life figure, bursting on the
music scene with his unforgettable 1956 single ''I Put a Spell on
You.'' Afraid that his original version was too timid, Hawkins
started drinking until he achieved the right level of inebriation,
then redid his vocals in a howl.
</P>
<P>
   The result was pure inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Spell'' was covered by Creedence Clearwater Revival, among
others. Hawkins enjoyed later success in music and film, opening
for the Rolling Stones in 1980 and appearing in the Jim Jarmusch
film ''Mystery Train.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' stage act was over-the-top, too. He would appear from
inside a flaming coffin, a bone through his nose and a
cigarette-smoking skull on a stick in his hand. Hawkins called the
skull ''Henry.''
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, the Hawkins' estate has become a bone of
contention. His attorney, Gary M. Spritz of Beverly Hills, Calif.,
did not return messages, so it is unclear how much money is
involved.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Hawkins' fifth ex-wife is in charge of the
estate, which was news to the widow Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a bit of a legal drama between the widow and the
ex-wife,'' acknowledged Danny Dolan, a spokesman for the estate.
''We'll find out when the will is filed for probate in mid-May.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, Nigolian should have a good idea about the search for
survivors. But she makes it clear that her search is about closure,
not cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not trying to make this a gold hunt,'' she says.
''That's not what this is all about. We simply want to get to the
heart of the true submissions.''

<HEADLINE> Hill, McCraw Compete for Award  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- It's business-as-usual in the Faith
Hill-Tim McGraw household for mom and dad to win honors at awards
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gracie gets up and pretends like she's making an acceptance
speech,'' said McGraw, describing his daughter, almost 3. ''Maggie
(19 months) claps for her.
</P>
<P>
   ''So, they're sort of getting the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   McGraw has seven nominations, including the top award of best
entertainer, at this year's Academy of Country Music Awards, which
will be presented May 3 in Universal City, Calif. He is up against
his wife, the Dixie Chicks, Sawyer Brown and Shania Twain. Garth
Brooks won it last year.
</P>
<P>
   He says his competition with Hill is very friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ''If either one of us wins, we get to bring the trophy home to
our house,'' McGraw said. ''It doesn't really matter.''
</P>
<P>
   McGraw is also nominated for best male vocalist. Hill is
nominated for best female vocalist. The Dixie Chicks have also been
nominated for best duet or group, best album for ''Fly,'' and best
single and best video for ''Ready to Run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Country Music Awards show will feature more than
20 performers, including Hill, McGraw, Lonestar, George Jones,
Asleep at the Wheel and Reba McEntire.
</P>
<P>
   Dolly Parton will host, and CBS will broadcast the show live (8
p.m.-11 p.m. Eastern) from the Universal Amphitheatre. It is the
only one of the three major annual country music awards shows to
take place outside of Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take pride in bringing a little bit of Hollywood to country
music,'' said producer RAC Clark, son of ''American Bandstand''
legend Dick Clark. ''And Dolly has that connection to Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, presenters will include Billy Bob Thornton and
Marie Osmond.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll just try to keep things moving,'' Parton said. ''And if
I've got something fun to say, something clever or something
meaningful, hopefully I'll be able to do that and make it all seem
like it's going faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Country music fans shouldn't miss the opening of the show. Alan
Jackson and George Strait will perform their duet ''Murder on Music
Row,'' a sharp critique of Nashville's recent pop-leaning musical
direction. Jackson will also sing with Hank Williams Jr. on
Williams' ''Blues Man,'' which Jackson recorded on his latest
album.
</P>
<P>
   The Judds will perform their reunion single ''Stuck in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Parton, who will perform her bluegrass version of Billy Joel's
''Travelin' Prayer,'' promises to bring spontaneity to a show that
has done without a host for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to stick to the cards as far as knowing who the guests
are and what they're going to do,'' she said. ''But you know me
well enough to know that I can't stick to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   McGraw, Jackson, Strait, Toby Keith and Collin Raye are
nominated for best male vocalist. Hill, Twain, Martina McBride, Jo
Dee Messina and Chely Wright are nominated for best female
vocalist. The Dixie Chicks, Asleep at the Wheel, Brooks &AMP; Dunn,
Lonestar and Sawyer Brown are nominated for best duet or group.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who survived a near-fatal automobile crash a year ago,
capped a comeback year with three nominations: best album for
''Cold Hard Truth,'' best song for ''Choices'' and best vocal
event, collaborating with Chad Brock and Hank Williams Jr. on
Williams' ''A Country Boy Can Survive.''
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 country music industry workers who are members of
the Academy of Country Music nominate and select the winners for
the annual awards.

<HEADLINE> Jessica Andrews: Mature When I Want  </HEADLINE>
By TOM GARDNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (AP) -- Trailing a whiff of coconut oil,
Jessica Andrews ducks into the bathroom of her tour bus to assess
the results of a poolside afternoon in the Florida sun. The mirror
shows overall improvement in the tan, but burn on the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, she steps up to the microphone at a small
riverside amphitheater to start a half-hour sound check for the
evening's concert. She swaps ideas with her band. Her favorite song
isn't working, and she's savvy enough to scrap it.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the pro Jessica headed for the stage and left the
16-year-old Jessica on the bus checking tan lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm mature when I have to be, but just kicking around, I'm a
big kid,'' she said. ''I've been playing all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   On this night, poolside playtime ends with an hour-long show
opening for Lonestar. At the end of April, she hits the road with
Trisha Yearwood. There are some 30 shows on this year's tour,
ranging from county fairs to the Las Vegas Hilton and the Greek
Theater in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   She already has toured with -- and won over -- Faith Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I became a big Jessica Andrews fan from the moment I heard her
sing. She had so much soul,'' Hill told Country Music Television.
''She has it so much more together than I had in my first show.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews is scheduled to perform at the Academy of Country Music
Awards in Universal City, Calif., on May 3. She is one of three
nominees for top new female vocalist. The awards show will be
broadcast live on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she is working on her next album, looking for new
music, but sticking with her current sound.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I nailed it on my first album as far as my style,''
she said. ''I'm going to stick to that because it's what I do best.
I just want to find songs that I love to sing.''
</P>
<P>
   The lilting ballad ''Unbreakable Heart'' is her third -- and
favorite -- single from her debut album ''Heart Shaped World''
(DreamWorks). Her first single ''I Will Be There for You,'' also on
DreamWorks' ''The Prince of Egypt-Nashville'' album, was followed
by the flirty ''You Go First.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews ranges vocally and emotionally from that twangy
confection debating a first kiss to a Delta-dusky Bobbie Gentry
sound on ''Hungry Love,'' about a barhopping teen-age mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''On this next album, I'd like to do a song that kind of
showcases my voice more, like 'I Will Always Love You.' It started
my career. I do have a song that's like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews was not quite 11 when she sang the Whitney Houston
standard for DreamWorks Nashville boss James Stroud, who went to
her west Tennessee home to hear her sing.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, that's the tune that doesn't work in the Florida
sound check. It has been a mainstay of her shows, but got old and
was dropped. It's going back in, just not tonight. Jessica the
trouper will know when it's right.
</P>
<P>
   Stroud was won over by Andrews' musical instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has a natural ability to emote. She knows when to push,
she knows when to be tender,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Her talent, stage presence and vocal control lead to the
inevitable comparison to another teen-age country phenom. She
doesn't even cringe now when the question comes up.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first started my career, before anybody had heard my
music and seen my videos, they automatically assumed I was the next
LeAnn Rimes. Now they know we're so totally different on style, our
voices, our music.
</P>
<P>
   ''Actually, a person I get compared to more is Christina
Aguilera. It's style-wise. I would love to do a duet with her one
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Andrews missing out on being a kid?
</P>
<P>
   In a blink, the green eyes flash.
</P>
<P>
   ''It kind of bugs me sometimes that people keep on asking me
that. Not to be offensive or anything, this is something that I
love to do, and I'm doing it and I'm really enjoying it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people just automatically assume all the time that I'm
just work, work, work and I'm being robbed of my teen-age years.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is SO not true!''
</P>
<P>
   Hill says that's the person she toured with.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Jessica is like a normal teen-ager because she's been
through normal teen-age things. She reads the magazines, listens to
the music. She likes to have fun and eat pizza and do all the
things that teen-agers like to do,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The CD collection on Andrews' tour bus includes Hill, Houston,
Reba McEntire and Wynonna Judd, but Aguilera is there, as are
soulful Macy Gray and alternative bands Filter and New Radicals.
</P>
<P>
   Her style?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely country. Country for today. Country is going
through a huge transition right now. There's songs on pop radio
that sound like they belong on country. There's country hits
topping the pop charts,'' Andrews said. '''Amazed' is a great song.
I don't think it's country or pop or anything. I think it's just a
great song. Great songs just cross over. 'Breathe' is a great song.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard Tim McGraw say once that the only people who aren't
for crossing over to pop are the ones who know they won't be able
to do it. Country is my home, but if pop wants to play my songs and
sell 10 million records, I'm not going to pass that up.''

<HEADLINE> Actors Get Taste of Marine Life  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARRIS ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -- As soon as the cast of ''Semper Fi''
arrived at the Parris Island Marine Corps Recruit Depot, drill
instructors were in their faces, ordering them to form up and drill
like recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It basically went on for 10 minutes and that was all the 10
minutes we needed,'' said Michael Pena, who plays one of the eight
main roles in the pilot being filmed here by DreamWorks Television
and NBC Studios.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first stepped on this island, my whole perception of
the Marines changed,'' said another cast member, Vicellous Reon
Shannon. ''My respect for them has grown 10,000 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Semper Fi'' is short for the Marine motto ''Semper Fidelis,''
Latin for ''always faithful.'' The prospective series, conceived by
Steven Spielberg, would follow a group of recruits through basic
training and their subsequent Marine careers in special forces.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ''Semper Fi'' will have to run its own Marine-like
gantlet past the program-pickers at NBC as they assemble the
network's fall schedule. Just as at the other broadcast networks --
all of which will announce their 2000-01 lineups with fanfare in
mid-May -- many pilots are called by NBC, but few are chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Semper Fi'' is one of about two dozen series that NBC execs
are considering. Among the six networks, some 120 candidates are in
the running. For most of them, a pilot episode serves as their
entry exam.
</P>
<P>
   To film theirs, the ''Semper Fi'' cast was mobilized in early
April. For about 10 days before the cameras rolled, they
experienced life as recruits under the watchful eyes of drill
instructors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have maybe an hour or two of drilling and then we go back
to our apartments,'' said cast member Tammy Townsend. ''Just from
the little bit, I'm bruised. I have the marks to show it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg hit on the idea for the series after filming the movie
''Saving Private Ryan'' about the D-Day invasion, said Jim Uhls,
one of the executive producers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically he wanted to do a show about a young Marine's
enlistment -- having a private in the Marine Corps going out into
the service,'' Uhls said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot focuses on the rigorous 12 weeks of Marine basic
training. The producers wanted to film where Marines are trained,
and Parris Island is the only base where women take basic training.
</P>
<P>
   One floor of a barracks has been transformed into a production
office. Above, a second-floor room with rows of neatly made bunks,
weapons hanging from the foot of each bed, is used to shoot
interiors.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the ''Semper Fi'' cast had had military experience --
''just the police,'' laughed Reon Shannon, who has appeared in
''NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Michael Watkins, whose credits include ''NYPD Blue''
and ''The X-Files,'' said working with the Marines has made the
show more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until you come on this base and you start to experience what
really happens to the human psyche and spirit here'' it is hard to
realize what recruits go through, he said. ''The power of this base
seeps into you.''
</P>
<P>
   The island, linked to the mainland by a causeway, is fringed
with marsh, and the barracks, parade ground, and firing ranges are
scattered between stands of palmetto and live oaks dripping gray
moss. Marines from the eastern United States have trained here
since 1915, and each year about 19,000 go through basic training.
</P>
<P>
   Three Marine drill instructors worked with the cast, making sure
they experienced recruit life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think all the actors have done a tremendous job -- their
willingness to learn, their eagerness, their tenacious attitude.
It's just unbelievable how they try to conquer everything we throw
at them,'' Gunnery Sgt. Ann Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We basically turn the stress on and then turn the stress off
when it's called for,'' said Gunnery Sgt. Ondra Armstead, another
drill instructor. ''When the actors first got here, we were pretty
stressful. We were pretty hard on them. We wanted to give them that
initial feeling that recruits get.''
</P>
<P>
   Actress Bianca Kajlich said the challenge of being a Marine hit
home when she saw recruits still training long after the cast
called it a day. ''We're going home and sleeping in our nice beds
and they're still going,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But until NBC gives ''Semper Fi'' thumbs up or thumbs down,
Kajlich may not be sleeping too soundly.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Payment Cuts Worry States  </HEADLINE>
By HOPE YEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- State governments fearful of losing
billions in tobacco settlement money are scurrying to find ways to
keep the cash coming in the face of lagging cigarette sales and
high-stakes litigation in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The states already took a billion-dollar hit this month after
their payments were decreased to reflect last year's 9 percent
decline in U.S. cigarette shipments. Pennsylvania received $198
million, about $28 million less than projected, and other states
reported similar declines of 10 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The losses, which some state officials say may continue, could
shave more than $20 billion from the $206 billion due to 46 states
over 25 years to cover health-related costs, under a ''volume
adjustment'' clause of the settlement agreement. Even worse, states
worry that payments could be delayed for years in the event of a
crippling punitive award in a Florida class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   It's a potential problem for many states, which are using their
cut of the settlement to pay for projects ranging from smoking
prevention programs and health insurance for the uninsured to
schools, water projects and new jails.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, state governments are keeping close watch
on the health of the very industry at the core of the
health-related problems to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think state appropriators have been very cautious where
they put these dollars, knowing they're going to change,'' said
Joan Henneberry, a health policy expert at the National Governors
Association. ''I think state budgeters would be more concerned not
about the amount (of payments), but whether bankruptcy of the
industry delays the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Many states, like Pennsylvania, want to cushion the impact of
fluctuating payments with plans to set aside portions in rainy day
investment funds and by appropriating the settlement money for
programs year by year.
</P>
<P>
   Other states are bolder. Four tobacco states -- Georgia,
Kentucky, Virginia and North Carolina -- have passed or are
pondering bills to shield industry assets during a court appeals
process. That came after some analysts predicted record damages in
Florida and as the Justice Department sues the industry to recover
billions the federal government says it spent on smoking-related
health care.
</P>
<P>
   And a handful of states, including Florida, Virginia and
Louisiana, cite the declining payments and the industry's
bankruptcy risk as reasons why they may sell some of their
settlement to investors at a discount. They say it's better that
than counting on the industry to stay fully afloat for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't afford to take that risk,'' said Louisiana State
Treasurer John Kennedy. ''If your rich uncle died and left you $4.6
billion, you wouldn't buy all Philip Morris stock; you'd diversify
... but every day we wait and more bad news comes out about the
tobacco industry, the price goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement agreement signed Nov. 23, 1998, the tobacco
companies agreed to pay 46 states for smoking-related health costs.
The companies earlier signed separate deals, also with ''volume
adjustment'' provisions, with Mississippi, Florida, Texas and
Minnesota for a combined $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements forced companies to end billboard advertising and
certain other marketing tactics, such as cartoon images like Joe
Camel. Companies then raised cigarette prices about 45 cents per
pack to help pay for the settlement, leading to about a 9 percent
decline in shipments last year, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts don't expect similarly sharp sales declines in future
years -- one projected a 1 percent to 2 percent drop annually. But
they are encouraging state governments nevertheless to consider
ways to minimize risk, either by legislating against the impact of
large damage awards or selling some of their shares to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be imprudent for any state not to consider the best
ways of protecting the annual revenues to that state,'' said Martin
Feldman, an analyst with New York-based Salomon Smith Barney. The
two best methods, he said, are legislation and securitization,
selling to investors.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, Attorney General Mike Fisher said he is not too
worried about losing the state's projected $11.3 billion in
settlement money. He called selling to investors a ''risky
venture'' for now since investors would expect a discount.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to cushion the impact of fluctuating payments is to
devote funds to health care, the costs of which will decrease as
smoking levels dwindle, said Fisher, a member of the tobacco
committee of the National Association of Attorneys General, which
negotiated the multistate settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shouldn't be concerned that the amount of cigarettes being
sold is going down,'' he said. ''It's a good sign and the primary
goal behind bringing this litigation in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-tobacco activists, meanwhile, worry that exaggerated fears
of losing settlement payments may undermine anti-smoking efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even if smoking were reduced by one percent annually for five
years, they said, the country would save billions of dollars that
would otherwise go toward treating smoking-related heart attacks,
strokes, low-birth rate babies and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think that so far there has been much too much focus on
lost settlement revenues and too little on the benefits from
reduced smoking levels,'' said Eric Lindblom of the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids.

<HEADLINE> Producer Marks Beatles Store Site  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Beatles producer George Martin wants the world to
remember the record shop that led the Fab Four to their first
recording contract, but his effort comes a little too late.
</P>
<P>
   Martin unveiled a plaque honoring the HMV shop on Wednesday,
though the store is shutting down on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Beatles manager Brian Epstein visited the shop in 1962 after
peddling the group's recordings around London with no luck. He was
persuaded to transfer demo tapes onto vinyl in the store's
recording studio to make it easier for people to play them.
</P>
<P>
   While there, the music caught the ear of an engineer, who
referred Epstein to a music publisher upstairs in the same
building. The publisher, in turn, referred Epstein to Martin, which
led to the group's deal with Parlophone Records.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he hadn't come in here, I would never have heard them -- who
knows what might have happened,'' Martin said.

   Arnold, 83, asked city commissioners on Monday for better signs
warning pedestrians of bicyclists.

<P>
   BEDFORD, Va. (AP) -- A contribution from ''Saving Private Ryan''
director Steven Spielberg will be used to build a theater at the
National D-Day Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg asked that the amount of his donation not be
disclosed, Richard Burrow, the memorial foundation's executive
director, said in announcing the contribution Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The theater, part of a $4 million education center at the
memorial, will be named for the director's father, Arnold
Spielberg, who flew Army Air Corps missions as a radio operator in
Burma during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saving Private Ryan'' is about the D-Day invasion. The movie
won five Academy Awards, including one for Spielberg as best

<HEADLINE> GE Investors Reject Pension Changes  </HEADLINE>
By HANK KURZ Jr., Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Retired General Electric employees who
claim they're forced to live on meager pensions while the company
sits on a $24 billion pension fund were unable to alter the
corporation's pension plan today.
</P>
<P>
   A union proposal to require shareholder approval of retirement
packages for those who serve on the board was defeated, garnering
only 33 percent support of the shares that were voted. Many
retirees say the pension plan offered to regular employees is
meager, especially when compared to benefits offered to top
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie J. Biggs-Adams, an NBC editor who spoke on behalf of the
union proposal at today's annual sharholder meting, said she was
pleased that the proposal gained more support than a year ago, when
it received 29 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting there,'' Biggs-Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders also gave overwhelming approval to a 3-for-1 stock
split at today's meeting. GE stock closed Tuesday at an all-time
high of $165.75 a share.
</P>
<P>
   GE shares were off 56\ cents a share at $165.43} in midday
trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 retirees handed out fliers outside today's
shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in two days angry workers have gone to
shareholders to try to bend management of their company's pension
plan.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, IBM workers got more support than they expected, but
fell short in a bid to make the company offer its traditional
pension plan to all workers. The computer maker converted thousands
of workers' pensions to a cash-balance plan, which critics say
hurts loyal employees who spend their entire careers at one
company. IBM employees who are at least 40 years old with at least
10 years' service are given a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking early retirement seven years ago when his job was
made obsolete, Lockett said, he has received about $50 in pension
increases. He said most GE pensions average between $700 and $800
per month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not beggars,'' Lockett, a machine repairman who served
37 years at GE, said at a rally Tuesday. ''We don't want handouts.
... What we want is a little respect.''
</P>
<P>
   A GE spokesman said the company has given retirees six pension
increases in 20 years, which he said was more than most of its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our pensions are very competitive with other companies,''
spokesman Gary Sheffer said. ''That's one of the reasons people
like to come to work for GE.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karen Friedman, a spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based
Pension Rights Center, said GE uses its pension surplus to
artificially boost earnings, while some retiree pensions are lower
than $400 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say to GE, 'You have a moral obligation to your
shareholders and your workers and retirees not just to do the
minimum or what you can get away with, but to do what's right. GE
should be a light onto corporate America, a leader,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman came to Richmond from Cleveland, Ohio, where she helped
IBM workers with their pension case.

<HEADLINE> USDA Lobbied on Biotech Squash  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmental groups asked the government
Wednesday to withdraw its approval of genetically engineered squash
because of concerns that it could cross with a wild relative and
make it a hardier weed.
</P>
<P>
   The squash is modified to make it resistant to plant viruses. A
recent study by the National Academy of Sciences questioned whether
the Agriculture Department had considered adequately whether the
virus resistance could spread from the squash to its wild cousin,
which is a pest to farmers in some southern states.
</P>
<P>
   In a petition to USDA, the groups said the squash case showed
that the department's process for approving genetically engineered
crops is inadequate. In addition to seeking withdrawal of the
squash, the petition asked the agency to require more testing and
analysis of biotech crops, depending on the potential environmental
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the potential risks of these crops nationally and abroad
and the unique role that U.S. regulators play internationally, ...
it is essential that USDA adopt a scientifically sound and
systematic approach to regulating the potential ecological risks
associated with genetically engineered crops,'' the petition said.
</P>
<P>
   USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service regulates
field testing of genetically engineered plants. It later decides
whether they can be released commercially on information provided
by the company about the plant and its potential effects on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We currently have a process for carefully reviewing these
products, but we are always willing to look at new data and ways to
improve the process and will carefully study the petition,'' USDA
spokeswoman Susan McAvoy said.
</P>
<P>
   A former APHIS geneticist, who now represents the biotech
industry, said the department demands sufficient data from
companies to determine whether new crops are safe for the
environment. The department ''does not defer to agribusiness to
decide which tests are necessary,'' said Val Giddings of the
Biotechnology Industry Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The two squash varieties, developed by the Asgrow Seed Co., were
approved in 1994 and 1996 after the agency decided that the crop
was unlikely to increase weed problems. The National Academy of
Sciences study said longer-term studies were needed to support the
USDA's conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Restricting the areas where the squash can be initially grown
would be preferable to unconditional deregulation, at least until
more data are available,'' said the academy's study, which was
released earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Giddings, who worked on the squash approval while at USDA,
conceded the agency ''did not have perfect knowledge'' about the
ecological impact, but said there was sufficient data to approve
the crop and that ''no one has identified any negative consequences
to the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, squash have also been made virus-resistant through
conventional breeding methods that are not subject to the review
process required of biotech varieties, Giddings said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences study was a broad review of the
government's regulation of pest-protected crops. The academy is
doing a separate study of USDA's regulatory process at the request
of Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to NRDC, other groups signing the petition included
Greenpeace, Sierra Club, Environmental Defense and the Union of
Concerned Scientists.

<HEADLINE> Cartoons Go Three-Dimensional  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A parade of cartoon stars is going
three-dimensional as Hollywood mines the animated world for
live-action movies starring X-men, the Grinch, Rocky and
Bullwinkle, and the Flintstones.
</P>
<P>
   From Superman to Batman, Popeye to Dick Tracy, movie studios
have had a long history of transforming comic-book or cartoon
characters into flesh and blood. The tradition continues Friday
with a second live-action movie about the prehistoric folks of
Bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' recounts the early
romance of Fred and Wilma and Barney and Betty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a huge fan of the cartoon when I was kid,'' said Stephen
Baldwin, who plays Barney Rubble in ''The Flintstones'' flick.
''It's kind of coincidental because Barney was my favorite
character, because he was seemingly the dopey guy who usually had
the solution or answer in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie co-stars Mark Addy as Fred, Kristen Johnston as Wilma,
Jane Krakowski as Betty and Joan Collins as Fred's mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   This summer brings ''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,''
featuring computer-generated versions of the cartoon moose and
flying squirrel. Co-starring as their real-life nemeses are Robert
De Niro as Fearless Leader, Jason Alexander as Boris Badenov and
Rene Russo as Natasha.
</P>
<P>
   ''These characters are part of our pop culture,'' said ''Rocky
and Bullwinkle'' director Des McAnuff. ''It's great to revisit
them, and for people with fond memories of the characters, you
hopefully want to spend 90 minutes with them in a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Also coming this summer is ''X-men,'' featuring living,
breathing versions of the comic-book world's favorite mutants.
</P>
<P>
   Coming for the holidays late this year are Jim Carrey in ''Dr.
Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' directed by Ron Howard,
and ''102 Dalmatians,'' the second live-action flick based on
Disney's animated classic.
</P>
<P>
   In the works over the next few years are live-action takes on
other Marvel comics, including Spider-man and the Incredible Hulk.
Also planned is a live-action movie of Josie and the Pussycats,
based on the comic-book and cartoon series about an all-girl rock
band.
</P>
<P>
   Adaptations of two-dimensional characters pose a challenge for
filmmakers, who must try to satisfy fiercely loyal fans of the
originals while fleshing out the material for wider audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we do our jobs right, audiences will love these characters
not just as cartoon characters but as people,'' said Brian Levant,
who directed the new Flintstones movie and its 1994 predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been abuzz with chat and pre-emptive carping
about ''X-men,'' which has nearly 40 years of comic-book devotion
to cope with. Many X-men fans seem pleased with much of the
casting, particularly Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as lead
mutants Professor X and Magneto, but devotees are critical of how
some characters look in the movie's trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it me, or does Magneto's helmet look too small? Like he's a
pinhead,'' one fan said on an ''X-men'' message board. ''I think
this movie is going to be a BIG disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian McKellen, who plays Magneto, has his own ''X-men'' site
where he provides information about the film, dispels rumors and
offers reassurances that the movie will adhere to the X-men spirit
despite a modern, more realistic look to the costumes than the
campy comic-book outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's appropriate on the page isn't necessarily appropriate
in a moving picture,'' McKellen said. ''I caution people to wait
and see the movie. If they don't like it, they should go make their
own movie, or just stay with the original comic.''
</P>
<P>
   While he loved immersing himself in the ''X-men'' world,
director Bryan Singer said he is anxious for a project with fewer
fan preconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're very passionate people,'' Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''X-men'' fans should take heart in knowing the movie is being
made by devotees of the comic books themselves, said Avi Arad,
chief executive of Marvel Studios, which is working with Hollywood
producers on other films based on Marvel characters.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a whole new generation of filmmakers, geeks like us
who grew up on these universes,'' Arad said. ''They have the talent
and clout to bring these characters to life in ways they've dreamed
about for a long, long time.''

<HEADLINE> Justices' Ruling Favors Prisoners  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- State prison inmates whose federal court
appeals are dismissed so they can pursue claims in state courts are
allowed to raise new issues when they seek federal court help
again, the Supreme Court said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision in a Nevada case dealt with arcane
technicalities of ''habeas corpus'' proceedings. But it potentially
could help hundreds of thousands of prisoners nationwide get
federal court hearings into whether their state prosecutions
violated some federally protected right.
</P>
<P>
   It was the court's fourth habeas-corpus ruling in eight days.
The four alternately expanded and contracted federal court access
for state prisoners in differing circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision revived convicted Nevada killer Antonio
Slack's attempt to have a federal court study arguments he raised
in a 1995 appeal. Lower courts had concluded that his appeal was an
abuse of his right to appeal, and they refused to consider the
arguments it raised.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court that the lower
courts were wrong, and sent Slack's case back to those courts to
determine whether he is entitled to a hearing on the merits of his
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also made it easier for inmates to get their claims
before federal appeals court after federal trial judges dismiss
them for procedural reasons. Kennedy said such appeals are proper
if reasonable judges could find the inmates' claims valid and the
procedural rulings wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Slack was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to
life in prison in 1990 for killing Alanna Holmes, 12. He admitted
killing the girl but said it was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada Supreme Court upheld his conviction in 1991, but he
then sought help from a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   A series of Supreme Court decisions over the past 15 years has
limited federal court access for state prisoners, and a 1996
federal law further restricted federal judges' second-guessing of
state court conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Before state prosecutors could respond to Slack's 1991 appeal,
he asked that the federal proceeding be postponed until he could
pursue additional claims in state appellate courts. The federal
judge dismissed Slack's case without prejudice in 1992, leaving him
the chance to refile it after exhausting all state remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Slack lost those state court appeals, and in 1995 returned to
federal court. But a federal judge in 1998 threw out the appeal,
ruling it was illegal because it raised issues not contained in the
1991 appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the judge, but
the Supreme Court disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that even though the restrictive 1996 federal law --
the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act -- applied to
Slack's case, his newest federal appeal was not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 1995 petition should not have been dismissed on the
grounds that it was second or successive,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Nevada ''remains free to impose proper procedural
bars to restrict repeated returns to state court for
post-conviction proceedings,'' and that federal judges have
authority ''to prevent vexatious litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented. They said
Slack should not be allowed to raise claims not included in his
1991 federal appeal.

   MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Technical problems shut down Italy's stock
market for most of the day Wednesday, leaving investors less than
two hours to trade stocks at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Milan market's only explanation during the abbreviated
trading day was that ''technical problems tied to the distribution
of information'' were blocking access by some banks and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians eventually said software problems caused the
blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Trading finally opened in late afternoon. The market extended
the normal session for a half-hour, making for a 1-hour, 45-minute
trading day.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout came during Italy's extended Easter holiday, which
made for a lighter than usual trading day in itself. Traders seemed
to take the technical problems in stride, saying they had
experienced daylong blackouts on the Italian market before.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 132; Nasdaq Down 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower today as the latest
sign of economic growth brought interest rate worries to the
foreground for the first time this week. Technology stocks were
holding up better than the broad market.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite was
down 10.09 to 3,701.14.
</P>
<P>
   Other stock indicators were lower. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 132.16 to 10,992.66 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 6.93 to 1,470.21.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Dow and the Nasdaq each rose more than 200
points, many investors retreated to the sidelines, debating their
next moves. The market was rattled after the Commerce Department
reported orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods
rose in March for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   After two straight months of declines, orders for durable goods
-- items expected to last at least three years -- rose 2.6 percent
last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $215.2 billion,
the government said.
</P>
<P>
   The report revived fears that the Federal Reserve will continue
raising interest rates in an effort to force a slowdown of the
economy. The Fed has raised interest rates five times since last
June, and many economists expect the Fed to bump up rates again on
May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Fed is looking for signs of moderation, they won't find
it'' in the durable goods report, said David Orr, chief economist
at First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were looking ahead to Thursday, when the
government will release first-quarter gross domestic product
figures. Many analysts expect the economy grew at a 6 percent rate
-- too fast for the Fed's comfort, but not as brisk as the 7.3
percent rate posted in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a latent fear that if those numbers are stronger than
expected, it will force the Fed to be aggressive about raising
rates,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at
Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about rising interest rates weighed on financial
services stocks. American Express fell 1 3/8 to 156 5/8 and J.P.
Morgan fell 1 9/16 to 136 3/8, weighing most heavily on the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate earnings reports provided the only real spark in the
market.
</P>

   Compaq Computer edged up 7/16 to 29 15/16. Late Tuesday, the

<HEADLINE> Taxpayers' Electronic Filing Rises  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taxpayers dramatically increased their use of
computers, credit cards and direct bank deposits during this year's
income tax filing season, in which 35 million returns were filed
electronically with the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   But getting through on the telephone to the IRS remained a
problem. Almost four in 10 calls went unanswered even though the
lines were open 24 hours, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics released Wednesday by the IRS show that people are
growing increasingly comfortable with doing their own taxes on home
computers. The number of self-prepared electronic returns received
as of last Friday doubled to more than 4.9 million compared with
the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The 35 million electronic returns -- most of them filed by
professional preparers -- was 1.4 million more than the IRS had
expected and represented a 20 percent increase over last year. The
number of electronically filed returns now makes up 27 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are more used to computers,'' IRS Commissioner Charles
Rossotti said. ''Secondly, the software is getting very good. It's
not just the filing, it's a better way to prepare the tax return.''
</P>
<P>
   Working toward a goal of 80 percent electronic filing by 2007,
the IRS has been aggressively promoting the advantages, such as
fewer mistakes and much faster processing of refunds. Rossotti said
the agency will continue expanding the number of taxpayers who can
use identification numbers in place of the signature form that is
still required for most who file electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little thing but it is still a barrier,'' Rossotti
said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, about 7 million taxpayers used the electronic
signature option, including 1.4 million who did their own returns.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has asked Congress to approve a $10 tax credit
for people who file electronically, which would cover the cost of
most electronic filing services. The IRS is also working with
private industry on ways to allow people to prepare and file their
taxes on the Internet at no cost, Rossotti said.
</P>
<P>
   About 186,000 taxpayers have charged $536 million in taxes on
their American Express, Mastercard and Discover cards so far this
year. Both are huge increases over 1999, when about $184 million
was charged on credit cards in the first year of the program.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 200 percent increase in the number of people who
paid taxes through direct debits from bank accounts and 25 percent
more people had their refunds deposited directly, the IRS reported.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this growth, an older piece of technology remained a
problem for the IRS. About 65 percent of all telephone calls have
gotten through so far this year, up from last year's dismal 50
percent level but far from adequate, Rossotti said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were better than we expected to be. But we still have a
long ways to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although technology and better use of existing staff will
improve things, Rossotti wants Congress to approve a 9.5 percent
budget increase that will enable the IRS to hire about 2,000 more
employees for customer service and to reverse a steep slide in
enforcement. In both cases, he said, technology will never fully
replace people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who are trying to pay, we want them to get through
and get the help they need,'' Rossotti said. ''If they don't want
to pay, we don't want them to be able to shift the tax burden onto
their neighbors.''

<HEADLINE> Some Drug Prices Top Inflation Rate  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices for drugs that older Americans use most
often jumped higher than the rate of inflation last year, says an
advocacy group's study. President Clinton cited the findings today
to promote his proposal to add prescription drug coverage to
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seniors living on fixed incomes simply can't cope with these
kinds of price increases forever,'' Clinton said. ''That's why we
should take action to help them, and do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders released the report
at the White House to highlight soaring drug prices and call on
Congress to pass legislation giving all Medicare beneficiaries
coverage for their medicines -- an idea opposed by Republicans, who
say aid should go to the neediest seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the GOP proposal does not go far enough. ''It would
do nothing for those seniors with modest, middle-class incomes
between $15,000 and $50,000,'' he said in a Roosevelt Room ceremony
flanked by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you are dealing with drug prices increasing two, three
times the rate of inflation, the impact is extraordinary,
especially for a population that is living on a fixed income,''
said Ron Pollack, president of Families USA, which commissioned the
study. The group, which advocates universal health coverage for all
Americans, supports Clinton's drug benefit proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that wholesale prices for 50 prescriptions
frequently used by seniors rose by 3.9 percent last year, faster
than the overall rate of inflation at the retail level, which the
government reported at 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for all prescription drugs jumped 5.8 percent in 1999,
government figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs common to seniors have soared 30 percent on average since
1994, according to the group's study.
</P>
<P>
   Drug industry officials said the report exaggerates drug price
increases. A government measure of wholesale prices found that
prices for all prescription drugs went up only 1.3 percent last
year, said Jackie Cottrell, spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA zeroed in on medicines most important to seniors to
highlight what Pollack says is the need for a broad drug insurance
program that will help all elderly Americans -- who are living
longer and whose doctors are increasingly treating with drugs -- to
deal with soaring prices at the pharmacy window.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed the wholesale price for a year's supply of
furosemide, a generic used to treat hypertension and congestive
heart failure, doubled to $57 as of January compared to its price a
year before.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a year's supply of Klor-Con 10, used as a potassium
replacement, jumped nearly 44 percent to $286 from $199, the report
said. Yearly price increases for other drugs cited in the report
include:
</P>
<P>
   --Glucophage, a diabetes drug, rose to $708 from $661.
</P>
<P>
   --Procardia, a hypertension drug, increased to $901 from $874
</P>
<P>
   --Premarin, used for estrogen replacement, rose to $208 from
$186.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to add drug coverage to Medicare as an option for
all Americans age 65 or older. Administration officials say rising
drug prices are a problem for all seniors and want a broad plan --
costing $195 billion over 10 years -- for 39 million Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   They are locked in a heated debate with congressional Republican
leaders who believe drug coverage should go to low-income Americans
who need it most. Republicans say there's no reason to give drug
benefits to the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who already have
some type of coverage through HMOs or retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders earlier this month unveiled the outlines of a drug
proposal calling for private health plans to offer drug benefits
and government subsidies to pay drug costs for low-income seniors.
Most of the $40 billion they have earmarked for a five-year
overhaul of Medicare would go toward the drug plan, GOP lawmakers
said.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Medical Privacy Laws Needed  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proposed federal regulations to assure the
privacy of medical records are inadequate in some respects,
excessive in others, health care officials said Wednesday in urging
Congress to come up with comprehensive privacy legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Rules proposed last November by Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala fall short in terms of coverage and
enforcement, said Janlori Goldman, director of the Health Privacy
Project at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress should act swiftly to fill these gaps,'' she said at
a hearing of the Senate health committee.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala came out with the rules after Congress failed to meet a
self-imposed August 1999, deadline to enact a law ensuring that a
person's medical records remain confidential and are not subject to
abuse by marketers or employers.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, to be finalized later this year and go into effect in
2002, limit disclosure of medical information to the ''minimum
necessary,'' give patients the right to see their medical records,
require health care providers to write privacy contracts with their
business partners, and preempt weaker state privacy rules.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary, said Janet Heinrich of the General Accounting
Office, the investigative wing of Congress, ''has attempted to fill
an otherwise significant gap in privacy protection.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said a GAO study of public comment on the proposed rules
revealed that while there is considerable support for the aims of
the rules, there are also concerns that they could be too costly
and in some cases impede good health care.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joanna Horobin, speaking for the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, said too many restrictions on access to important
data ''will severely hurt medical research.''
</P>
<P>
   John Houston of the American Hospital Association said his group
was ''gravely concerned'' that Shalala had exceeded her authority
in drawing up the rules. He said the standards on ''minimum
necessary'' disclosure were ''at odds with good medical practice
and potentially very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association
of America, warned that the standards ''would have a chilling
effect on detecting and reporting (medical) errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses complained of the cost and complexity of
determining whether state or federal rules prevail. ''One of the
primary reasons for supporting federal confidentiality legislation
is that care is delivered across state boundaries,'' Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   Others noted that Shalala was limited in what she could impose
without congressional action. The rules cover only health care
providers, health plans and clearinghouses and apply only to
electronic data, not the paper records that make up most health
information.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congressional action would protect all health information,
however it is transmitted and wherever it exists,'' said Sen.
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Democrat on the committee chaired
by Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords, Kennedy and others were close last year to reaching a
compromise medical privacy bill. But they were unable to resolve
differences on two issues -- the right to sue over improper use of
records and the privacy of teen-agers who have abortions.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Flies Open Cockpit To N. Pole  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ANDES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gus McLeod knows cold better than most anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur aviator from suburban Maryland made history April 17
as the first pilot ever to fly to the North Pole in an open cockpit
plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was cold beyond caring,'' McLeod, 45, said Wednesday at a
news conference at the National Geographic Society, a sponsor of
the two-week, 3,500-mile journey.
</P>
<P>
   He even tried an electric suit -- and turned it up full blast --
to battle temperatures that for days hovered at 15 degrees below
zero. The suit left a silver-dollar-sized 3rd degree burn in his
stomach that he did not even feel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't get any warmer, and that burning part wasn't good,''
McLeod said.
</P>
<P>
   So why did he do it? ''A personal challenge,'' he said. McLeod
said he's a longtime admirer of Roscoe Turner and other early
aviation pioneers. ''I always like to feel I was part of that
club,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even his craft, a 1939 Boeing Stearman biplane, heralded from
the era of his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit was a bit tight for the six-feet-one-inch, 285-pound
aviator. McLeod said his chest was just six inches from the rim of
the cockpit, and that all he could move -- sometimes during six
hours of flight -- were his arms and ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Between the tight fit and extreme cold, ''the suffering was
unimaginable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod was in the plane by himself but not completely alone. A
crew from National Geographic followed in a ''chase plane'' and got
the trip on film. It airs June 4 as part of the Explorer series.
</P>
<P>
   ''He squeezed this massive frame into what looked like a little,
toy airplane with his head popping out of the cockpit,'' said show
Producer Lori Butterfield. She said she teased him about not having
any blood in his veins, to which he confirmed he circulates
antifreeze.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod weathered a tough stretch between Pickle Lake, Ontario,
and Churchill, Manitoba, when engine gaskets blew, spilling oil
down the side of his craft. Temperatures plunged, visibility was
lost and McLeod and his craft had to rest in Churchill for a few
days to wait for spare engine parts.
</P>
<P>
   A film clip showed McLeod landing April 16 in Eureka, Nunavut,
with a hearty, ''Hey, Eureka, glad to meet ya!'' And again moments
after the April 17 touch down at his final destination. ''I made
it,'' he said in a satellite call to his wife, Mary.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod left two items dear to him at the Pole. One is an urn
bearing the ashes of his friend, Doug Duff, who spoke of making the
trip to the Pole for years, right up until his death in a 1998
plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   He also left his aircraft, which he hopes to have recovered.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod said the engine broke for about the fourth and final time
during the trip and could not be repaired. It's at 86 degrees north
and 93 degrees west, and drifting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's headed for Norway at 12 miles a day,'' McLeod said.
''That plane loves to travel.''

<HEADLINE> Dobbs, CNN Say They Won't Meet Again  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't look for any return engagement at CNN for
former ''Moneyline'' anchor Lou Dobbs.
</P>
<P>
   The financial journalist and CNN on Wednesday both emphatically
denied speculation that Dobbs, who left the network last year for
an Internet venture, would be going back to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal and New York Daily News reported that
CNN founder Ted Turner had approached Dobbs about returning as an
anchor. Since Dobbs left, CNN's nightly business wrapup has lost
ground in the ratings to CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Although a no-compete clause has prevented Dobbs from anchoring
another TV show, he is a partner with NBC in a monthly financial
newsletter and syndicated radio show. NBC has also acquired a
minority stake in the Web site devoted to outer space that Dobbs
has started, and there is speculation he may eventually work for
CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs confirmed his conversations with Turner. He talked about
it Wednesday on the Don Imus radio show, which is simulcast on
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this were just between Ted and me,'' he probably wouldn't
have left CNN, Dobbs said. Dobbs had been feuding with Rick Kaplan,
CNN USA president, before his exit.
</P>
<P>
   Imus pointed out that NBC had ''put up a lot of money'' for
Dobbs' Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't look good for you to stick it to NBC by going back
with Ted, would it?'' Imus asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't, as put so eloquently, stick it to NBC, Don,''
Dobbs replied. ''I'm very happy with my partners at NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Imus he would not return to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN spokeswoman said Dobbs and Turner are friends who talk
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no plans for Lou Dobbs to return to CNN,'' said Sue
Binford of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Under his CNN contract, Dobbs cannot anchor another television
show until 2002. He said he cannot predict if he will want to get
back into TV then.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Drug Profits 'Out of Line'  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Al Gore blamed pharmaceutical
companies Wednesday for profits that are ''way out of line'' and
plugged his own drug-payment plan with assists from President
Clinton at the White House and senior citizen Shirley Kindle at a
drugstore photo-op.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigning vice president, the Democrats' presumptive
presidential nominee, put Republican rival George W. Bush and the
drug companies at the center of his argument for expanding Medicare
coverage to include prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Profits are good for encouraging investors, Gore said, but drug
companies are ''going far beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to the point that the margins are way out of
line with what most other industries and most other lines of
business believe is normal and adequate. They're using the market
power to dictate prices that are way above what competition would
set them at.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Kindle, 65, of Ansonia, spoke to a small assembly in
the bingo room of South End Senior Center.
</P>
<P>
   Kindle, who had already bought her April supply of medications,
accompanied Gore earlier to Pelton's family drugstore for what he
called ''an illustration'' for invited news cameras: pharmacist Hal
Schoen lining up the woman's 12 different prescriptions and ringing
up the total of $506.34.
</P>
<P>
   ''Which is more than I get from Social Security,'' Kindle said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who said later she never shops at the photogenic
Pelton's, told Gore her husband makes a little too much money for
her to qualify for a state prescription-drug program.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was advised if they got divorced she'd be eligible for
some low-income assistance, but she said after 35 years she's
really not ready to give him up,'' Gore chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said later the Kindles' monthly
income of $1,800 also would make them ineligible for aid under a
House Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed adding a Medicare prescription drug benefit
and letting uninsured Americans 55 to 65 buy into Medicare
coverage. His drug plan would offer free coverage for low-income
recipients, catastrophic coverage for all and an optional
cost-sharing benefit for others with premiums of $44 a month when
phased in.
</P>
<P>
   By design, Gore's appearances Wednesday coincided with the
release of an advocacy group's findings that prices for drugs most
commonly used by senior citizens jumped higher than the rate of
inflation last year, with some doubling in price.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton and congressional Democrats cited
the Families USA study as proof that people need help.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seniors living on fixed incomes simply can't cope with these
kinds of price increases forever,'' Clinton said. ''That's why we
should take action to help them, and do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Clinton's comments
indicated ''he is clearly misinformed about our fair and
responsible plan that both strengthens Medicare and provides
prescription drug coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration and GOP leaders in the House are locked in a
dispute over the size and scope of the action Congress should take.
</P>
<P>
   At the senior center, Gore warned anew against Bush's tax-cut
and spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''He calls it compassionate conservatism, but it's really casino
economics. He wants us to roll the dice on an unaffordable tax
scheme that gives the most to those who need it the least,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer countered that Bush would dedicate
nearly half of his five-year budget to ''strengthen and save Social
Security and Medicare, provide a prescription drug benefit and work
in a bipartisan manner to enact much-needed reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Fleischer, ''If Al Gore is wondering why he has a problem
with credibility, his partisan response to Medicare reform provides

   Before returning to Washington, Gore took questions from
reporters, including the customary question about whether some

   ''Even if it were at a stage where I could, if I wanted to, give

think it's fair to people who would end up on that list,'' Gore
said, adding praise for Lieberman and fellow Connecticut Sen.
Christopher Dodd as ''outstanding individuals.''

<P>
   Gore also was asked whether, given Bush's repeated criticism
that he will say anything to get elected, he worries he might have
a ''credibility problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he has a repetition problem,'' Gore said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMYRA, Neb. (AP) -- A man was shot to death after stopping to
pull a woman from a burning car, investigators said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Parminter and Shannon Bluhm were found dead late Tuesday
night near the burned-out car on a rural gravel road, the Nebraska
State Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Parminter, 45, who lived near the accident scene,
and Bluhm, 27, of Eagle, apparently did not know each other.
</P>
<P>
   A female suspect was arrested early Wednesday morning and
investigators recovered a gun believed to have been used to kill
Parminter, State Patrol spokeswoman Terri Teuber said. The suspect
was not identified.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe Bluhm was involved in a confrontation with
someone she knew, which may have led to the car fire. Police said
Parminter apparently saw the fire and was trying to help Bluhm when
he was killed.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Vows To Beat Estimates  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. expects to exceed
diminished earnings estimates for this year with help from
streamlining and exports of its F-16 fighter, chief executive Vance
Coffman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's No. 1 defense contractor forecast annual earnings
of $1.05 a share. Last fall, as a series of rocket launch failures
weakened its business, Lockheed had slashed earnings estimates for
2000 to $1 a share from $2.15.
</P>
<P>
   With Lockheed's $9 billion-plus in orders to make more than 200
F-16s for the United Arab Emirates, Israel, Greece and Egypt,
Coffman said, the F-16 ''has had a terrific run for new business.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffman, chairman and chief executive of the Bethesda, Md.-based
maker of rockets, satellites and fighter jets, discussed the
prospects of Lockheed in a presentation at an aerospace symposium
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The event hosted by Aviation Week &AMP; Space Technology magazine
and Credit Suisse/First Boston was attended by some 300 financial
analysts, investment bankers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Coffman also repeated previous remarks that the Defense
Department may divide a $200 billion order for the Joint Strike
Fighter between Lockheed and rival bidder Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   The order for about 3,000 of the jet fighter now in development
is the biggest weapons program under way anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The company later reiterated Lockheed was sticking to its
''winner-take-all'' bid strategy toward getting the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The planes are to replace the Air Force's F-16 and A-10 planes
and the Marine Corps' AV-8Bs and F/A-18s. The government has said
it will decide next year who gets the contract, with the first
aircraft to be delivered in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Also in on the program are Britain, a financial partner planning
to buy some of the jets, and Turkey as a development partner.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange,
Lockheed was down almost 6 percent, or by $1.50, at $24.06\ a
share.

<HEADLINE> CEO Gives Porsches To 20 Executives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHELMSFORD, Mass. (AP) -- The driving force behind the surge in
Mercury Computer's stock price might have been a fleet of sports
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury chief executive Jay Bertelli in January 1999 offered his
top executives a new Porsche Boxster if the company's stock price
doubled by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Shares were trading at $21.25 when Bertelli made his offer. The
stock split two-for-one in November and closed Tuesday at $37.38.
</P>
<P>
   So this week Bertelli delivered 20 new silver Porsche Boxsters.
Two more of the $48,000 cars will be loaned for two weeks at a time
to top performers among the company's 450 other employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We called it the ultimate performance challenge,'' said David
Bertelli, Jay's brother and Mercury's vice president of
organizational development.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury has made computers for defense, intelligence and medical
systems for 17 years. It had net income of $6.1 million in the
quarter that ended in March.

<HEADLINE> Murder of U.K. Burgler Stirs Debate  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The maxim that a man's home is his castle is being
tested by the case of a farmer sentenced to life in prison for
murdering a burglar in his home.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody confrontation at Tony Martin's shabby Victorian
farmhouse has highlighted public concerns about crime and the
ability of police to protect people in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, tabloid newspapers and some politicians have rallied
to defend Martin, who shot two unarmed intruders with a shotgun.
His case has been on front pages repeatedly since he was convicted
last week of murdering 16-year-old Fred Barras, whom he shot in the
back, and wounding Brendon Fearon with intent to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Fearon, 30, and Darren Bark, 33, who waited outside the home,
were both convicted of conspiring to burglarize Martin's home and
sentenced to three years and 30 months, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Barras had been in court 28 times for various offenses, Fearon
35 times and Bark 52 times.
</P>
<P>
   ''What has happened to our courts system when career burglars
and muggers get a few dozen hours community service, or a couple of
months in prison if they're unlucky, while people defending their
homes against the very same criminals risk long prison sentences?''
Conservative Party leader William Hague said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hague called for a change in the law to create ''a strong
presumption that ... the state will be on the side of people who
protect their homes and their families against criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not spell out how he would change the law on
self-defense, which says that lethal violence is permissible to
fend off a violent attack, provided the defender had taken
reasonable steps to avoid violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''What does Mr. Hague suggest?'' asked Sir Michael Davies, a
former High Court judge who opposes any change in the law. ''Are
people going to be encouraged to have guns or an electric fence
with killing power around their back garden, to have a pair of
man-eating tigers tied up to be released if there is a burglar
about?''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors described Martin, who came to court each day with a
teddy bear, as an eccentric man with a deep fear of burglars.
</P>
<P>
   ''He fired at Barras and Fearon not in self-defense but in
accordance with his professed view that the only way to stop
thieves was to shoot them,'' prosecuting attorney Rosamund
Horwood-Smart said.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony in the trial, Martin lived alone near the
village of Emneth, 100 miles north of London, in a house
illuminated by a single 15-watt bulb on each floor, and slept fully
clothed with his pump-action shotgun close by.
</P>
<P>
   His three Rottweilers -- Otto, Bruno and Daniel -- patrolled
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Shotguns are common in the countryside, but Martin's certificate
to own one was revoked in 1994 after he shot at the car of a man
caught gathering apples in his orchard.
</P>
<P>
   After the Aug. 20 killing, some 300 people jammed the village
hall for a meeting about crime, many complaining about the length
of time it took for police to respond to calls.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, eel-catcher John Spalton said he had seen
Fearon bleeding at the side of the road but did not stop because of
his fear of crime in the area. ''You don't stop unless it is
somebody you know,'' Spalton said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin plans to appeal the murder conviction. He can also apply
for early release in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Comment in many newspapers was sympathetic to Martin, with
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Martin may have shot the boy in the back -- he may well have
deserved to be punished -- but did he deserve a life sentence?''
said The Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mail also thought Martin went too far, but said: ''In
hamlets and remote farmhouses all over the country, there are
countless people who today wonder how they would have respond in
such circumstances. What has been so glaringly exposed in this
awful case is the way whole swathes of rural Britain have been all
but abandoned by the forces of law and order.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 34; Dow Down 151  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as the latest
sign of economic growth brought interest rate worries to the
foreground for the first time this week. Technology stocks held up
better than the broad market.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite was down 34.44 to 3,676.79.
</P>
<P>
   Other stock indicators were lower. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 151.40 at 10,973.42 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 10.77 at 1,466.37.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Dow and the Nasdaq each rose more than 200
points, many investors retreated to the sidelines, debating their
next moves. The market was rattled after the Commerce Department
reported orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods
rose in March for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   After two straight months of declines, orders for durable goods
-- items expected to last at least three years -- rose 2.6 percent
last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $215.2 billion,
the government said.
</P>
<P>
   The report revived fears that the Federal Reserve will continue
raising interest rates in an effort to force a slowdown of the
economy. The Fed has raised interest rates five times since last
June, and many economists expect the Fed to bump up rates again on
May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Fed is looking for signs of moderation, they won't find
it'' in the durable goods report, said David Orr, chief economist
at First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were looking ahead to Thursday, when the
government will release first-quarter gross domestic product
figures. Many analysts expect the economy grew at a 6 percent rate
-- too fast for the Fed's comfort, but not as brisk as the 7.3
percent rate posted in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The government will also release the latest employment cost
index -- a gauge of wage pressures which Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
considers a crucial barometer of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a latent fear that if those numbers are stronger than
expected, it will force the Fed to be aggressive about raising
rates,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at
Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about rising interest rates hurt financial services
stocks, which typically suffer when higher rates crimp lending
volume. Citigroup fell 2 to 62 1/2 and J.P. Morgan fell 2 1/4 to
135 11/16, weighing heavily on the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate earnings reports provided the only real spark in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer edged up 3/8 to 29 7/8. Late Tuesday, the
computer maker reported that excluding gains in its investment
portfolio, first-quarter net income and revenues were virtually
unchanged from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Online auctioneer eBay gave up early gains and was down 1 7/8 to
151 11/16. The company's first-quarter operating results exceeded
Wall Street expectations as the amount of merchandise sold on its
site surpassed $1 billion for the first time. Also, eBay announced
plans to split its stock 2-for-1.
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of technology stocks were higher today. Internet
retail powerhouse Amazon.com gained 1 1/2 to 53 15/16 and Broadcom,
a maker of silicon semiconductors, rose 3 7/8 to 164 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a very slender margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 789.69 million
shares, behind Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 1.43 to 487.60.

<HEADLINE> Plunging Euro Takes Financial Toll  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Although the euro stabilized Wednesday after
sinking to a new low against the dollar, its weakness poses a
challenge not only to the European Central Bank but also to
economies and individuals outside the zone of 11 countries that use
the single currency.
</P>
<P>
   Among its casualties are British manufacturers, who are losing
sales as they try to compete against goods priced in chronically
weak euros.
</P>
<P>
   Americans investing in shares of European companies also are
taking a beating. Swelling regional stock valuations look a lot
less impressive once those shares are converted from euros into
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has plunged almost 23 percent since January 1999, when
it was launched amid hopes that it would one day rival the dollar
as a global reserve currency.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the euro fell to a record low of 91.62 cents during
trading in New York. It staged a modest rally on Wednesday, rising
to 92.33 cents in late trading in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This chronic weakness leaves the European Central Bank in an
unenviable position when it decides Thursday whether to raise a key
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   If the ECB boosts the lending rate from its current level of 3.5
percent, it risks choking off the economic recovery under way in
many parts of Europe and exacerbating the region's already high
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But if the bank leaves the rate unchanged, its inaction could
further weaken confidence in the currency and trigger a global
selloff of euros.
</P>
<P>
   The only alternative, some economists said, is for the bank to
overcome its reticence about intervening directly in currency
markets to try to prop up the sagging euro.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is almost imperative,'' said Neil Parker, chief economist
at the Royal Bank of Scotland. ''You need the ECB to step in and
stop the decline before it gets out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blame much of the euro's decline on the charms of the
glittering U.S. economy, which has attracted money from Europe that
investors might otherwise have put into European stocks. This
outflow of funds has caused the dollar to strengthen and has
undermined the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's decline also has proven to be a boon to tourists
visiting from the United States who are able to buy more with their
dollars when they exchange them.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. boom highlights structural problems, such as inflexible
labor markets, that are constraining growth in Europe, said Lee
Ferridge, chief currency strategist at Rabobank in London.
</P>
<P>
   Ferridge predicted that the euro will resume its slide and drop
to 90 cents in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, leader of the euro-zone's
largest economy, said he expects the currency to strengthen in the
near future, thanks to regional economic growth and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I advise a little more calm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The weak currency has been particularly worrisome to British
companies that export to continental Europe or compete with imports
priced in euros.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederation of British Industry released a quarterly
survey Wednesday showing that exports among Britain's manufacturers
have fallen, with more companies recording a downturn in overseas
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ''These results are generally depressing and send some ominous
signals. They suggest that the hoped-for recovery has stalled and
that manufacturing is on the brink of slipping back into decline,''
the survey quoted Nick Reilly, chairman and managing director of
Vauxhall Motors, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has opted for now to keep the pound
rather than join the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the euro extends across the Atlantic, where
private and institutional investors have tried to cash in on
Europe's gradual recovery by buying shares of Siemens AG, Vodfafone
AirTouch PLC and other standout companies.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Xetra Dax index of blue-chip shares listed on the
Frankfurt stock exchange has increased by 7.8 percent since the
start of the year. The Paris CAC 40 stock index has risen 4.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, the euro has plunged 7.8 percent against the dollar
during this same period. For Americans, that decline has offset
much of the nominal appreciation in European stock valuations.
</P>
<P>
   After euro-denominated shares are converted into dollars, the
Xetra Dax index showed no increase for the year, while the Paris
CAC 40 actually lost 2.9 percent of its value in dollars.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Church Apology Said Lacking  </HEADLINE>
By STAN LEHMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTO SEGURO, Brazil (AP) -- The Catholic Church apologized
Wednesday to Brazil's Indians and blacks for the ''sins and
errors'' committed by its clergy and faithful over the past 500
years. Indians were reluctant to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   The apology preceded a special Mass held on the beach where
Franciscan Friar Henrique de Coimbra celebrated Brazil's first Mass
on April 26, 1500, four days after the Portuguese expedition made
landfall.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said some 15,000 people, including more than 300
bishops, attended the Mass under a steady drizzle in Coroa
Vermelha, just outside this seaside resort in the northeastern
state of Bahia. Italian Cardinal Angelo Sodano represented Pope
John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ask the Lord for forgiveness for the sins committed against
our brothers, especially against the Indians whose rights have not
always been respected,'' said the Most Rev. Jayme Chemello,
president of the National Brazilian Bishops' Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ask forgiveness for not always having respected the dignity
of our black brothers and sisters, whose ancestors were brought to
this country as slaves,'' Chemello added, a 43-foot cross towering
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, some 50 Pataxo Indians in feather headdresses and
red-and-black body paint marched to the altar and stretched out a
large black banner. A 24-year-old Pataxo named Matalaue climbed the
altar and said the banner symbolized ''our mourning for 500 years
of suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Apologies are not enough. We want respect. We want our
dignity,'' he said. ''We weren't respected 500 years ago and we
continue not being respected today. We have been and continue to be
the victims of exploitation, rape and extermination.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mass was held near the same spot where last Saturday police
used clubs, tear gas and rubber bullets to break up a crowd of
about 2,000 Indians, who gathered from all over Brazil to protest
the anniversary celebrations of what they called Portugal's
''invasion'' of this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want justice and demand that those responsible for last
week's violence be punished,'' said Matalaue, The crowd cheered and
applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the apology was welcomed by Guanair da Silva Santos, a
representative of Bahia's Afro-Brazilian community.
</P>
<P>
   ''The apology opens the door to dialogue,'' Santos said. ''And
the only way to deal with the racism and prejudice that prevail in
this country is through dialogue. It is a first step that hopefully
will be taken up by the rest of society.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mass also opened the 38th General Assembly of the Bishops'
Conference. At the weeklong meeting, the bishops will discuss
internal issues as well as national problems.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues on the agenda is economic globalization and the
widening gap between Brazil's haves and the have-nots. Another
topic is land reform. Much of the clergy sides openly with the
Landless Rural Workers Movement, which encourages the invasion of
idle farm land to pressure the government to accelerate agrarian
reform.

<HEADLINE> Japan Gov. Defies Environmentalists  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The governor of Japan's southernmost island gave
the go-ahead Wednesday on plans to build an airport despite
protests from environmentalists concerned about nearby coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns to protect the reefs and complaints from some
landowners have so far delayed plans for the new airport on the
southern part of Ishigaki Island in Okinawa, about 1,000 miles
southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Keiichi Inamine promised to make sure that construction of
the airport does not harm nature, said Tomohiro Maekawa, an
Okinawan official. Steps will be taken to prevent soil drainage
into the sea during the construction, which will cost about $415.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Okinawan government has pushed to build the new airport for
more than two decades because Ishigaki's current airport does not
have the capacity to handle the large number of visitors. About 1.3
million passengers arrive every year.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental assessment and other measures are expected to take
about three years, with six to seven more years needed for the
construction, Maekawa said.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, construction began on a new runway at Tokyo's main
international airport that had been held up for more than three
decades by farmers who refused to give up their land.

   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- To the horror of the Columbine victims'
families, the sheriff's department decided to release video
Wednesday of the dead and the dying, with some of the footage set
eerily to a pop music soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The material included helicopter footage of efforts to reach the

Richard by his feet,'' said Connie Michalik, whose son, Richard
Castaldo, was shot outside the school and left paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the library footage was filmed after the bodies were
removed, ''pools of blood on the carpet are very obvious, with tags
marking where those victims fell, all set to a musical
background,'' said attorney James Rouse, who represents some
victims' families. ''Each one of those pools of blood is where
someone's child died or was seriously wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a court order, Jefferson County District Attorney Frank
Hutfless released the tapes to the victims' families Tuesday and
planned to make copies available to the public Wednesday for $25.
</P>
<P>
   Six victims' relatives had sued to gain access to the tapes to
prove authorities mishandled the rescue and failed to heed warnings
of the rampage. Authorities have declined those allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But many Columbine families had hoped the tapes would not be
released to the public. The tapes depict the carnage of April 20,
1999, when two students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, killed 12
classmates and a teacher, wounded 23 others and committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm totally disgusted they're selling the tapes for $25,''
Michalik said. ''Where is the $25 going? We had to fight like crazy
to even get these tapes released.''
</P>
<P>
   Other relatives were outraged that the 30-minute videotape,
adapted by a Littleton firefighter for the training of police and
fire personnel around the country, contained added background
music, including ''If It Were Up To Me,'' by Cheryl Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Lyrics include the lines: ''Maybe it's the movies, maybe it's
the books, maybe it's the bullets, maybe it's the real crooks,
maybe it's the drugs, maybe it's the parents.'' It concludes:
''Maybe it's the end, but I know one thing. If it were up to me,
I'd take away the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Rouse, the relatives' lawyer, said some family members turned
down the audio as they watched. ''I don't know why you'd call it a
training video. It's more of a documentary with a musical
background,'' Rouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Jefferson County sheriff's and attorney's
offices would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton spokeswoman Kelli Narde defended the tape, saying it
was put to good use in 82 training seminars conducted in the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the unfortunate event that another school shooting does
take place, the Littleton Fire Department believes that it has
provided a valuable service to educate other public safety
officials,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the cafeteria scenes shows students getting shot, but
they do capture students scattering as the gunmen detonate a bomb
and begin shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The other section consists of footage shot by KCNC-TV
photographers as a helicopter hovered over the school during the
rampage.
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, the sheriff's office has angered Columbine
families by circulating a portion of the cafeteria surveillance
tape that eventually ended up on television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A 90-second segment was broadcast in October when it was leaked
to CBS after being shown as part of a training video at a
firefighters' seminar in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff John P. Stone later called the release of the training
video an embarrassment and ordered all copies returned to his
office.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Time magazine published a cover story based on five
of the gunmen's own videotapes that the sheriff's office showed to
a reporter. Stone maintained they were shown only for background
purposes, which Time has denied.

<HEADLINE> Vermont Gov. Signs Gay Union Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Gov. Howard Dean signed a
first-in-the-nation law Wednesday granting gay couples nearly all
of the benefits of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is a courageous and powerful statement about who we
are in the state of Vermont,'' the Democrat said. ''I also believe
that this legislation speaks to the heart of this state, and
certainly to my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation creating marriage-like ''civil unions'' reached
the governor's desk shortly before lunch time, just a day after the
House gave its final approval. And by the time of a 2 p.m. news
conference, he had already signed it out of view of TV cameras,
photographers and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said he signed the bill privately because he did not want
the ceremony to be a triumphal party by supporters of the law.
Instead, he said, it was time for the state to begin healing.
</P>
<P>
   ''In politics, bill-signings are triumphal,'' he said. ''They
represent overcoming of one side over another. These celebrations,
as the subject of the matter of the bill, will be private.''
</P>
<P>
   The law will allow gay couples to form civil unions beginning
July 1. That will entitle them to all of the 300 or so rights and
responsibilities available to married couples under Vermont law in
such areas as taxes, inheritance and medical decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Other states will probably not recognize Vermont civil unions,
and such status will not entitle gay couples to any the benefits
available to married couples under federal law in areas such as
taxes and immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, no state has gone further than Vermont is giving
gay couples something approximating marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill came about after the Vermont Supreme Court unanimously
ruled in December that gay couples were being unconstitutionally
denied the benefits of marriage. The court left it up to the
Legislature time to decide whether to let gays marry or to create
some kind of domestic partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed after strong debate in which opponents
argued that homosexuality is ''against natural law.'' Opponents
have warned that they will make their anger known at the polls in
November when members of the Legislature are up for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, gay couples will be able to go to their town
clerks for licenses and have their unions certified by a judge or
member of the clergy. Breakups will be handled in Family Court,
just as divorces are, although they will be called dissolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers deeply involved in the issue said they were
disappointed there was no bill-signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the story needs to be that gay and lesbian couples in
Vermont had a historical day,'' said Democratic Rep. William
Lippert, the Legislature's only openly gay member.

<HEADLINE> Judge restores Essenberg as chairman of Independence Party  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A judge Wednesday reinstated Jack Essenberg
as chairman of the state Independence Party, ruling that insurgents
improperly removed him from the post in February.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Bernard Malone Jr.'s ruling was the
latest twist in intraparty squabbling among Independence members.
</P>
<P>
   Malone decided both the Independence Party's rules and Robert's
Rules of Order indicate that only Essenberg, as chairman, had the
authority to set the agenda during special meetings of the party's
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the judge said Essenberg was within his authority to
refuse to place his own removal on the agenda of a stormy Feb. 4
meeting which resulted in his ouster by opponents after Essenberg
had stormed out. Frank MacKay of North Babylon was voted in as the
Independence Party's new chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Also fueling the power struggle is a rivalry between factions of
the Independence Party, which is New York state's version of the
national Reform Party. One faction was led by Essenberg and the
other by leftist activist Lenora Fulani.
</P>
<P>
   Fulani's unconventional backing of conservative Pat Buchanan for
the party's presidential nomination also brought her in opposition
to Essenberg, who favored Donald Trump as the party's presidential
standardbearer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their attempt to remove two-thirds of the executive committee
for disloyalty and corruption was a joke because it's not true,''
Essenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed his ouster on Fulani's attempt to seize control of the
party leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Malone ordered the other executive committee office holders
under Essenberg's chairmanship to also get their posts back
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Stewart, a Fulani ally, said Wednesday's ruling will be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision is an outrage,'' Stewart said. ''It undermines
the democratic process. It shows just how much the electoral
arrangement in New York, including the courts, is opposed to the
right of recall.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay is scheduled to moderate a forum Saturday in Buffalo to
hear from candidates interested in the Independence Party's
nomination for U.S. Senate. MacKay said he expects to be regarded
as the rightful party chairman by the state committee at that
event.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who do you think it is going to recognize, Essenberg?'' MacKay
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted that Malone's ruling will be ''laughed out''
of the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, has
confirmed he will be at the Buffalo forum and is seeking the
party's nomination while Democratic first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton has been noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Salamanca Wednesday, Clinton acknowledged she was
wary of running on a line on the New York ballot which Buchanan
would head as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a problem with Mr. Buchanan,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, sources also say Clinton is concerned about being
backed by a party Fulani plays a major role in.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Wednesday he also remains critical about Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I continue to have all the same objections to him and problems
with him and problems with his background,'' Giuliani said at a
City Hall news conference.
</P>
<P>
   If Buchanan heads the Independence Party ticket in New York,
Giuliani said, ''I'll have to make a decision about'' accepting the
party's nomination for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, MacKay said attendance at the Buffalo event
Saturday was a must for any candidate seeking the Independence
nomination. But Essenberg said he was not regarding the forum that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's a do or die,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Third-party backing can be valuable to candidates running for
statewide office in New York since the state allows major party
candidates to also run on third-party ballot lines. The
Independence Party line helped Democrat Charles Schumer defeat
Republican incumbent Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, the Independence Party's state committee will have
to meet to consider the party's Senate nomination. It is unclear
whether the leadership of the party will also be sorted out by then
or whether litigation will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Essenberg, from Highland Lake, had failed in federal court to
get his chairman's post back.

<P>
   FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Presumed Republican presidential nominee
George W. Bush and his father, the former president, will visit the
Kentucky Derby this year.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign spokeswoman said Wednesday the Texas governor
will visit Louisville on the first Saturday in May. Bush is
expected in Louisville only for the race.

<P>
   Former President George Bush has been a Derby visitor before,
most often as the guest of his close friend Wil Farish, who owns
Lane's End Farm in Woodford County.
</P>

   Vice President Al Gore attended the 1999 Derby as a guest of
Democratic Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton. Gore is not expected to

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 179; Nasdaq Down 87  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled today after the latest sign of
economic growth brought interest rate worries to the foreground for
the first time this week. Blue-chip stocks that have failed to live
up to the market's robust profit expectations led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   the Dow Jones industrial average fell 179.32 at 10,945.50.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite was down 87.06 to 3,624.17.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 16.15 to 1,460.99.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,533 down, 1,426 up and 494
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 979.71 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.06
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.79 to 484.24.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Dow and the Nasdaq each rose more than 200
points, many buyers retreated to the sidelines, debating their next
moves. Selling gathered momentum in the final hour of trading as
investors unloaded stocks in advance of a pair of crucial economic
reports due out Thursday -- the gross domestic product and the
employment cost index.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the market was rattled after the Commerce Department
reported orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods
rose in March for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   The durable goods report revived fears that the Federal Reserve
will continue raising interest rates in an effort to force a
slowdown of the economy. The Fed has raised rates five times since
last June, and many economists expect the Fed to bump up rates
again on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Fed is looking for signs of moderation, they won't find
it'' in the durable goods report, said David Orr, chief economist
at First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The report stimulated worries that Thursday's reports will show
the economy is growing too quickly. Most analysts expect the GDP
report to reveal that the economy grew at a 6 percent rate in the
first quarter -- too fast for the Fed's comfort, but not as brisk as
the 7.3 percent rate posted in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The government will also release the latest employment cost
index -- a gauge of wage pressures which Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
considers a crucial barometer of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a latent fear that if those numbers are stronger than
expected, it will force the Fed to be aggressive about raising
rates,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at
Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about rising interest rates hurt financial services
stocks, which typically suffer when higher rates crimp lending
volume. Citigroup and J.P. Morgan fell, weighing heavily on the
Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate earnings reports provided the only real spark in the
market. Investors continued punishing the blue-chip companies that
failed to impress Wall Street with their profit reports. Procter &AMP;
Gamble and 3M fell sharply for a second straight session.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer edged higher. Late Tuesday, the computer maker
reported that excluding gains in its investment portfolio,
first-quarter net income and revenues were virtually unchanged from
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Online auctioneer eBay finished lower after giving up early
gains. The company's first-quarter operating results exceeded Wall
Street expectations as the amount of merchandise sold on its site
surpassed $1 billion for the first time. Also, eBay announced plans
to split its stock 2-for-1.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a wide range of technology stocks were higher today. Sam
Stovall, senior equity strategist at Standard &AMP; Poor's, said he
expects the technology sector to regain leadership of the market in
the coming quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're advising investors to take advantage of periodic price
weakness in technology,'' he said. ''Those companies will have the
strongest profit growth.''

<HEADLINE> Eastman School of Music gets $1 million from stock-savvy pianoteacher  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A frugal piano teacher with a talent for
investing in the stock market is giving away her third $1 million
gift -- this time to the Eastman School of Music where she studied
on a scholarship in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Murray Trebert, 88, equates her success in accumulating
money with her musical talents. ''I use my eyes, I use my memory
and I'm not slow -- when I want to do anything, I don't fuss
around,'' she said with a hearty chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Yet holding onto the riches she has built up since the 1960s has
never interested her, so investing it back into the arts comes
easily.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't like money. Why, I don't know!'' she said. ''I
guess being in music from a tender young age, that was my love.
Everything was the music. The value of music is important, not
money. My mother used to say, 'Oh, that's only filthy lucre.'''
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of her gift to the Eastman School will provide
annual scholarship assistance to graduate and undergraduate
students. The remainder goes to the school's Sibley Music Library,
one of the world's largest academic music libraries.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Trebert has given $1 million to the Hochstein
School of Music, where she taught piano, and another $1 million to
the Al Sigl Center, a partnership of agencies that help people with
disabilities. She also has set aside two $100,000 scholarships at
the acclaimed Eastman School, begun by Kodak founder George Eastman
in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   From age 8 to 10, Trebert benefited from annual music
scholarships. ''They were little scholarships, but it's the
thought, just the encouragement, that counts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking her modest upbringing -- her father died when she was 10
-- Trebert recalled many times not being able to afford an ice cream
cone or spare a dime to ride a street car.
</P>
<P>
   Among the valuable lessons of childhood -- and from learning the
piano -- were persistence and patience. ''You have to be awful
patient with the stock market,'' she said, adding that
''thriftiness and investing ability'' also play a big part.
</P>
<P>
   She began playing the stock market after her husband, William, a
lawyer, died in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to be like my mother, cry all over the house and
moan and groan,'' she said. ''So I said, I'm going to sit down and
concentrate and get my mind on some of these companies. I want to
know all about them, their earnings and stuff. So I did and I stuck
with it. I taught myself. I'm not the type to join a stock club --
I'd be long gone, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by her music-loving mother, Trebert earned a master's
degree in musicology at Eastman in 1941, then taught at Western
Maryland College and worked as an organist. After marrying, she
returned to her hometown in the 1950s and taught music history at
the University of Rochester and piano at Hochstein. She also played
organ at several churches.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to quantify her worth, Trebert said she has not
yet given all her millions away. ''I'm going to continue to do it
just for fun,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 4 Charged in 1998 Sweden Disco Fire  </HEADLINE>
By KIM GAMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) -- Four men were charged Wednesday with
aggravated arson in a fire that swept a crowded dance hall in
western Sweden, killing 63 people and seriously injuring 50 others.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say a flammable liquid was poured over a pile of
chairs in the stairwell leading to the rented second-floor dance
hall, and at least one of the defendants set them on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Oct. 29, 1998, fire was allegedly started after an argument
broke out with party organizers over the entrance fee, prosecutors
claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were indifferent to the danger they had caused by their
actions,'' the summary of a 3,000-page judicial report said.
</P>
<P>
   The four men all denied the charge, though defense attorneys
acknowledged at least three were present at the stairwell of the
Macedonian cultural association where the fire started.
</P>
<P>
   Shoresh Kaveh, 19, Housein Arsani, 19, Mohammad Mohammadamini,
21, and Meysam Mohammadyeh, 19, all born in Iran but now
naturalized Swedes, were arrested earlier this year. Formal charges
were filed only after the investigation was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Kaveh's attorney, Goeran Bergendahl, said his client set the
chairs on fire, but ''He denies the charge of arson because he
couldn't understand that anybody would be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Mohammadamini and Arsani said their clients were
nearby but were not involved in starting the fire.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction on charges of aggravated arson usually carries a
sentence ranging from six years to life in prison, but prosecutor
Ulf Noren said Swedish law would allow a lesser sentence because
the suspects all were under age 20 at the time of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there are a lot of emotions involved, but I hope it
will be a fair trial,'' Noren said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was set to begin next Wednesday at an exhibition
center in Goteborg, 300 miles southwest of the Swedish capital,
Stockholm. Authorities had to find a site large enough to
accommodate some 500 relatives of the victims and survivors.
</P>
<P>
   When the fire broke out, some 400 people were crammed into a
space suitable for about 150. The staircase where the blaze started
was also the emergency exit, leaving only one narrow staircase for
the panicked crowd to flee. Many people jumped from second-story
windows.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Fund Summaries Subpoenaed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican congressman is subpoenaing FBI
summaries of the latest interviews with President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore about campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to see these new interviews to help us understand why
it took three years for the Justice Department to do its job''
investigating fund-raising abuses in the 1996 campaign, said Rep.
Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Burton complained that the Justice Department has not specified
who is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department rejected a request for the FBI summaries,
known as ''302s,'' that Burton made earlier this week, saying last
week's interviews ''relate to an open investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot accommodate your request ... at this time because it
would compromise federal law enforcement,'' Assistant Attorney
General Robert Raben said Tuesday in a letter to Burton.
</P>
<P>
   The Government Reform Committee is still seeking memos by FBI
Director Louis Freeh and Justice Department prosecutor Charles
LaBella recommending appointment of an independent counsel to probe
fund raising in the presidential campaign four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional panel subpoenaed the memos March 10.

By The Associated Press	   Showers swept across the Plains states on Wednesday,
and sunnyow
returained to New England.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The showers were scattered from easterain Montana to the Texas
Panhandle during the late moraining. By late afterainoon, the wet
weather had moved eastward, extending from North Dakota through
South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas into Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   A few thunderstorms developed with the showers, producing hail
the diameter of dimes at Canadian, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Afterainoon rainfall amounts over the Plains averaged less than a
quarter of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, low pressure centered off the coast pumped moisture
through New England, spawning showers and occasional sunnyow showers
across sections of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly an inch of sunnyow fell south of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   From New England, a thin line of very light, isolated showers
stretched along the Appalachians from New York state to Georgia,
turaining to locally heavier showers and a few thunderstorms over
southerain sections of Alabama and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to mostly cloudy skies dominated the Pacific Northwest,
while the Southwest and southerain Rockies had mostly clear and mild
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Park Service May Ban Snowmobiles  </HEADLINE>
By ELISABETH A. WRIGHT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST YELLOWSTONE, Mont. (AP) -- Randy Roberson remembers what
this bustling tourist town was like 30 years ago, before
snowmobiles started becoming the most popular wintertime way to see
Yellowstone National park.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was kind of a winter ghost town,'' the Rendezvous Rentals
owner says. ''There was no economy here. The majority of the people
moved away for the winter to follow employment opportunities. Even
business owners would close up. That was just a normal way of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the National Park Service is ready to impose new
restrictions on recreational snowmobiling at more than two dozen of
the sites it manages. In some cases, snowmobiles may be banned
entirely by next winter.
</P>
<P>
   The agency plans to announce the details Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Snowmobiles are allowed in more than 40 Park Service sites from
Acadia National Park in Maine to California's Sequoia National Park
and numerous parks in the Northwest and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service says a ban would significantly reduce pollution
and noise and may ease the stress on wildlife. But residents around
Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks call it an unnecessary
threat to their way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Wanner, manager of Yellowstone Arctic-Yamaha, said the
bigger problem is the thousands of automobiles and motorhomes that
stream into the park every summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's no more a wilderness area than Carnegie Hall,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service predicts a 30 percent decline in winter
visitors because of the snowmobiling restrictions. That would cost
the 17-county region of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho $16.5 million
and about 400 jobs, according to the Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Snowmobiling has grown into a wintertime boon for the area.
About 75,000 people take snowmobiles into Yellowstone each winter,
most entering the park on the groomed route from West Yellowstone
to Old Faithful. Hotels have sprung up, tours are advertised on the
Internet, and snowmobile sales, rental or repair shops are on
almost every street.
</P>
<P>
   Snowmobiles first entered the park in 1963. Last winter, the
park had 62,531 snowmobiles and 130,564 visitors. Winter attendance
was just a small fraction of the 3.1 million visitors Yellowstone
had in all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The BlueRibbon Coalition, a group of off-road enthusiasts, is
petitioning Congress to oppose a ban. Senators from all three
Yellowstone states have promised ''vigorous opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowmobile supporters contend that the Park Service is allowing
too little time for the development of cleaner, quieter machines,
and that they could live with some restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service proposal would maintain groomed trails only for
snowcoaches -- vans that run on tracks instead of wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Roberson said many of his clients won't come back if
snowmobiling is banned. The winter economy makes up half of his
business, he said. He also owns two motels, rents cars and provides
bus tours.
</P>
<P>
   Marysue Costello, executive director of the West Yellowstone
Chamber of Commerce, said tourists are calling to ask if a ban
already is in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just tell them that's not the case. But those are the
people having to call. How about all the ones that don't?'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has said anything short of a
snowmobile ban would violate federal air quality standards and a
1972 presidential order against off-road vehicle use that damages a
national park.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is expected to propose national emissions standards for
snowmobiles and other off-road vehicles later this year.

<HEADLINE> Delay in Canada School Stabbing Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A 15-year-old Canadian charged with stabbing five
people at his school on the first anniversary of the Columbine
shootings appeared in court Wednesday and had his bail hearing
postponed a week.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who had a bandage on his left wrist and a cast on his
right arm, said nothing, while his parents sat behind him, their
hands clasped on their laps.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian law prohibits identifying the youth, his parents or the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The boy has been charged as a juvenile with one count of
attempted murder, five counts of assault with a weapon, one count
of mischief and one of possession of a deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Police said further charges were possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been new information which has come to light. I
can't get into the specifics of it,'' Det. Kal Ghadban said outside
the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Police indicated last week that there was evidence the youth had
planned the attacks to coincide with the April 20 anniversary of
the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., where
two students killed 13 people before turning their guns on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The stabbings began at about 11:21 a.m. -- the exact same time of
day that the Columbine shootings started.
</P>
<P>
   Ghadban said Wednesday the prosecution would likely seek a
psychiatric assessment of the suspect before the bail hearing. He
has been described by other students as a loner who was teased
about his acne and thick, curly hair.
</P>
<P>
   Four students and a laboratory technician at Cairine Wilson high
school in the Ottawa area received minor injuries in the stabbing
attacks. The suspect allegedly slashed his own wrists before
turning the knife over to the school principal.

<HEADLINE> GM Recalls 279,000 1999 SUVs  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will voluntarily recall
about 279,000 sport utility vehicles that failed an air bag test
but says the vehicles pose no safety threat.
</P>
<P>
   The recall announced Wednesday involves 1999 model year
Chevrolet Tahoes, GMC Yukons and Cadillac Escalades built between
Sept. 1, 1998, and May 5, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   GM filed a petition in August asking the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration to disregard the test. NHTSA planned
to deny the petition, agency officials said Wednesday, and GM
dropped the request.
</P>
<P>
   In the February 1999 crash test, the head of the unbelted dummy
went through the bag and its chin touched the dashboard, then
snapped back. The amount of extension on the dummy's neck exceeded
the federal standard by about 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   GM was unable to reproduce the test results. The company
believes the NHTSA test was an anomaly that occurred based on lab
conditions that would not exist in real crashes, said Robert Lange,
engineering director of the GM Safety Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've spent a significant amount of time and effort to figure
out mechanically what happened because we were surprised with the
result,'' Lange said.
</P>
<P>
   The recall includes Yukons and Escalades because many have the
same air bag system as the Tahoe that failed the test.
</P>
<P>
   Lange said the company initiated the recall even though it does
not believe there is a safety threat because ''it will make NHTSA
happy. And it would make us happy to close this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   GM dealers will install a color-coordinated foam strip on the
edge of the dashboard of the affected SUVs at no cost to customers.
Lange estimated the company would spend $10 million to $20 million
on the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Affected owners will be notified of the recall by mail. Lange
said the automaker will need several months to produce the strips.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA officials said the agency will monitor the recall to
ensure the strip addressed the problem.

<HEADLINE> Iran Leader Endorses Media Crackdown  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's supreme leader on Wednesday endorsed
the recent crackdown on reformist newspapers, describing the
publications as ''deviant'' and urging his supporters not to remain
silent.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei condemned what he called ''a deviant
media movement that is trying to shape public opinion and turn it
against Islam, the revolution and the Islamic Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei's comments came as local media reported that a court
dominated by hard-liners had sent a warning to the brother of
reformist President Mohammad Khatami to rein in his liberal
newspaper, Mosharekat, or face sanction.
</P>
<P>
   Press Court Judge Saeed Mortazavi wrote Tuesday to Mohammad-Reza
Khatami, objecting to his newspaper's publishing several editions a
day. He said it amounted to Mosharekat's putting out several other
newspapers under its name.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this legal court notice is ignored in the next editions,
appropriate decisions will be taken against your newspaper,''
Mortazavi said in his letter, the daily Kayhan reported.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami is a close ally of his elder brother, the president, and
his newspaper is one of only three reformist papers to survive the
recent closures, which follow nationwide elections two months ago
that ousted hard-liners from their long-held majority in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen newspapers have been closed in recent days and two
leading pro-reform journalists have been detained, as hard-liners
seek to hold back the popular movement toward more democracy and
openness.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei, the country's supreme leader and a champion of
hard-liners, said reformers were undermining the principles of the
1979 revolution and the teachings of the imam, the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   ''All persons, groups, and factions loyal to Islam must come out
and take strong positions against those ... who are attacking the
revolution, the path of the imam, the constitution and the role of
the supreme leader,'' Khamenei told a meeting of religious
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Revolutionaries must not remain silent against these truths,''
he added in what appeared to be a green light for further measures.
</P>
<P>
   Reformist allies of Khatami have appealed to supporters,
including university students, not to take to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hard-liners are trying to create a crisis to use that as a
pretext for an even larger crackdown,'' said Karim Arqandehpour, a
senior editor at Mosharekat, and deputy chief of the reformist
Press Guild.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people should remain calm, because the reforms are not in
a life-or-death situation. They are now embedded in the hearts of
the Iranian people, and cannot be choked,'' he told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Students at Tehran's Amir Kabir Technical University stayed away
from classes Wednesday for a second day. In the central city of
Shiraz, all 17 universities were shut in support of the reformers.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown is aimed at rolling back the reforms initiated by
President Khatami who, since coming to power in 1997, has loosened
Iran's social, political and cultural restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Following their overwhelming defeat at the polls, the
hard-liners have been hitting back through their control of the
judiciary, the state broadcasting media and the Guardians Council,
which supervises elections.
</P>
<P>
   The council has annulled the results in 12 legislative seats won
by Khatami allies, awarding two of them to hard-line candidates. It
has also claimed vote fraud in Tehran, where reformers won 29 of
the 30 seats, and suggested that the results could be changed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the council announced that run-off elections would
be held May 5 for 66 seats that were not decided in the elections
for the 290-member parliament.

<HEADLINE> James Rubin Holds Last Briefing  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- James P. Rubin closed out a three-year run as
the State Department's main spokesman Wednesday in a shower of
rattles and spinning tops and gentle ribbing at his last briefing
for correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin is stepping down to help his wife, television reporter
Christiane Amanpour, take care of their infant son, Darius, in
their London home.
</P>
<P>
   From a back-row seat, Amanpour tried to elicit from her husband
a promise to take his turn at changing the baby's diapers. With
practiced diplomatic ambiguity, Rubin responded: ''I will do
whatever is necessary and appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   He wound up the lighthearted session by saying, ''It's been a
great honor to stand here and represent the United States.'' Rubin
also told reporters, ''It was a privilege to exchange with you
difficult questions, hopefully decent answers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Anne Gazeau-Secret, spokeswoman for the French foreign
ministry, called Rubin's departure ''a sad day for journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart surprised Rubin with a bag of
carrots, saying it was a gift from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The carrots were a reminder of a rare blunder by Rubin. During a
trip to the Middle East in December 1997, Rubin had told reporters
the White House was considering expanding the amount of food and
medicine Iraq could buy in spite of economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Described as a humanitarian program to help Iraqi children and
the elderly, the administration was sensitive to any suggestion it
was easing up on President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin, briefing reporters, said the program ''may be a
little carrot.'' He also took the required hard line toward Iraq
but any impression the administration was ready to negotiate with
Baghdad was not what the White House wanted left by a U.S.
official.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was said to be furious and Rubin was reprimanded by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and national security adviser
Sandy Berger for the misstep.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart presented the bag of carrots Wednesday ''as a small
token of (Clinton's) gratitude'' and said Rubin's service to the
president had been ''invaluable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was the spokesman for Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, in her four years there and then moved with her to
the State Department where he continued as one of her closest
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The correspondents at Wednesday's briefing then showered Rubin
with baby toys, squeezed rattles and staged a mock walkout,
returning after a few minutes to continue with the daily
question-and-answer session.

<HEADLINE> Ex-IBF official describes $100,000 payoff for Foreman-Schulzrematch  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Even though a rematch between
then-heavyweight champion George Foreman and Axel Schulz never
happened, it got the green light from the IBF because IBF president
Robert W. Lee squeezed Schulz promoter Cedric Kushner for $100,000,
a longtime IBF official testified Wednesday in Lee's racketeering
trial.
</P>
<P>
   While the accusation became public with Lee's November
indictment, the official, C. Douglas Beavers, for the first time
described his reluctance to participate in this affair, despite his
own bribe-riddled boxing career.
</P>
<P>
   That payoff, and a similar sum the prosecutors say another
promoter paid for the initial Foreman-Schulz match, are the largest
in the indictment against Lee and other IBF officials that charges
they took $338,000 to rig IBF rankings.
</P>
<P>
   They are also the only two payoffs to the IBF in the indictment
that appear directly related to heavyweight championship bouts.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner had protested Foreman's split-decision April 1995
victory over Schulz, and IBF rules allow rematches of controversial
bouts. Beavers sympathized, telling a federal jury the German
fighter outpointed Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just thought he should have got the rematch without having
to pay anything. I thought it was a travesty,'' Beavers said.
</P>
<P>
   At the IBF's convention the next month in Atlanta, Lee had
Beavers tell Kushner a rematch would cost $100,000, said Beavers,
Lee's handpicked ratings chairman from 1983-98.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers said Kushner initially thought he was joking, even
though Kushner had been making periodic payoffs averaging $5,000
twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers said Lee would regularly order him to get money from
Kushner by saying, ''Isn't it time you went to see the Fat Man,'' a
reference to Kushner's weight.
</P>
<P>
   The money, Kushner knew, was evenly divided among Lee, Lee's son
and aide Robert W. Lee Jr., IBF championship committee chairman
Bill Brennan, and Beavers, Beavers said.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner agreed to pay the $100,000, and the next month Beavers
drove from his home in Portsmouth, Va., and collected a manilla
envelope containing the money from Kushner at his home in East
Hampton, N.Y., Beavers said. The $100 bills were divided into four
packets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers then drove to the Vince Lombardi rest stop at the
northern end of the New Jersey Turnpike and gave $50,000 to Lee Jr.
for him and his father, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not linger with Lee Jr., nervous that their meeting would
look like a drug deal because the younger man drove up in a sporty
red convertible, wore a yellow jacket and gold jewelry, Beavers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers then drove to Brennan's home in Warsaw, Va., and
delivered his cut, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers said he did not know Schulz co-promoter Wilfrid
Sauerland, who prosecutors say gave Kushner the $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF ordered the rematch, but Foreman relinquished the IBF
belt instead of complying.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner has not been charged. His lawyer again declined to
comment on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Jr., 38, of Scotch Plains, is on trial with his 66-year-old
father, who lives in Fanwood.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 86, was indicted with Lee, but was severed from the
trial due to ill health.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers, 56, succeeded Brennan in 1981 as executive director of
the Virginia Athletic Commission, the agency that until 1995
regulated boxing in the commonwealth. That function is now
contracted to a private company owned by Beavers, the Virginia
Boxing and Wrestling Association Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers, who cooperated with investigators and is testifying
with immunity, wore a ''body wire'' to secretly record hundreds of
conversations with Lee. In coming weeks, Beavers is to guide the
jury through 80 talks, as well as videotaped meetings they had in
which money was exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors have not yet heard testimony from Foreman promoter Bob
Arum, who prosecutors said will tell how he funneled $100,000 to
the IBF to sanction the initial Foreman-Schulz title fight. An
exception was needed because Schulz was unranked.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, now in its third week, is expected to last three
months.

<HEADLINE> TV Morning Shows Go on the Road  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For television's ultra-competitive morning news
shows, you can tell it's nearly May by how busy their travel agents
are.
</P>
<P>
   They're hitting the road to attract attention during the May
''sweeps'' period, when ratings are used to set local advertising
rates. It begins Thursday and lasts until May 24.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, ''Good Morning America'' anchors Charles Gibson and
Diane Sawyer are bicycling through northern Indiana, recording
their trip on a video diary that will be seen the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's show will originate from Chicago, where Oprah Winfrey
has invited Sawyer to join her in a morning workout and breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lauer of NBC's ''Today'' will broadcast from Vietnam on
Friday, marking the 25th anniversary of the war's end. Sen. John
McCain, a former prisoner of war, was invited by ''Today'' to give
his impressions.
</P>
<P>
   NBC paid for McCain's trip, arguing it was no different from
when it flies guests to New York City for an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Next week ''Today'' begins its ''Where in the world is Matt
Lauer?'' promotion for the third year in a row, sending the anchor
to a mystery location each day.
</P>
<P>
   This year's gimmick: Viewers got to vote among 10 locations --
including Iceland, Niagara Falls and Prague -- to decide where Lauer
goes on May 5. More than 111,000 people voted through the ''Today''
Web site, spokeswoman Allison Gollust said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Early Show'' on CBS sends anchor Jane Clayson to Los
Angeles next week for a three-day ''Jane Goes Country'' segment.
Clayson will be a presenter on the Academy of Country Music awards,
also being telecast by CBS next week.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is likely to have other ''Friday Breakaway'' segments as the
summer goes on, spokeswoman Sonya McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   Both ABC and NBC are launching a series of summer concerts
during the sweeps period. The ''Today'' Friday morning concerts in
Rockefeller Plaza will kick off May 5 with Steely Dan, and the
year's lineup includes 'N Sync, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Don
Henley and Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good Morning America'' will have a performance on May 16 with
Carly Simon in New York's Bryant Park.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fans of NBC's drama, ''Law &AMP; Order,'' won't have
to worry about whether it will be renewed for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Studios USA announced a deal Wednesday that will keep
the show on the air through the 2005 season. Such a long-term
renewal is unprecedented for a regular series on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ''Law &AMP; Order'' debuted on NBC in 1990 and is enjoying its best
season in the ratings this year. It is ranked No. 13 for the season
among all prime-time shows by Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Its spinoff series, ''Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit,'' was
renewed through 2002, the network said.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows are produced by Dick Wolf for Studios USA.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Yard Gal'' opens with a complaint: Too many
people talk about Hackney without having been there.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that New Yorkers watching this British theater
import haven't been to that grimy blue-collar district of London
either. It's a bit off the tourist trail. But by the end of the
play they'll feel they had. ''Yard Gal'' is spare and riveting, and
while it's spoken in sometimes unintelligible London slang and
accent, you get the picture, loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   The play that opened Wednesday at the off-Broadway MCC Theater
is about six teen-age girls in a posse, or gang, although we only
meet two of them in this two-actor play on a bare stage with
minimal props.
</P>
<P>
   Marie (Amelia Lowdell) and Boo (Sharon Duncan-Brewster) are best
friends. They laugh, dance, fix each other's hair, take dope,
shoplift. After someone dies at a dance they spend a night in jail.
They aren't ruled by parents, school or jobs. They aren't avidly
seeking sex, violence or revenge on society, but won't shy away
from doing any of these things.
</P>
<P>
   They look down on prostitution, but will trade sex with a yardie
(pusher) for gear (dope), or use the lure of sex to steal a man's
wallet. Boo lives in a juvenile home, and Marie with her father,
who beats her up when she comes home wearing a miniskirt.
</P>
<P>
   Marie wounds a rival with a broken bottle, and Boo goes to jail
for it. Marie gets pregnant. It's a sordid story without any kind
of happy end, and yet in their quirky, very up-to-the-minute way,
they're just normal kids who make you care about them without
pitying them.
</P>
<P>
   The play, by 27-year-old Rebecca Prichard, was performed in 1998
by the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theater, which was
founded to discover provocative, stimulating plays. ''Yard Gal''
toured England in 1998 and was performed in 1999 in Essen, Germany.
The New York production came about through an exchange program
between American and British Equity.
</P>
<P>
   It was originally commissioned by the Clean Break Theater
Company, a troupe for ex-convicts. But the credits list no jail
time for actresses Lowdell and Duncan-Brewster, playwright Prichard
or director Gemma Bodinetz.

<HEADLINE> Clinton takes campaign to cow country and college campus  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALAMANCA, N.Y. (AP) -- Taking her Senate campaign from cow
country to a college campus, Hillary Rodham Clinton called
Wednesday for tax changes to help keep family farms in the family
and accepted two offers to debate rival Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also said she had concerns about pursuing the
third party ballot line of the New York wing of the Reform Party
because of the possibility that she could be on a ticket headed by
conservative Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a very big difference with him on nearly every issue
you can imagine,'' Clinton told reporters after a speech to
Democrats in the Cattaraugus County community of Salamanca.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and the New York City mayor have both been
invited to a forum for Senate candidates Saturday in Buffalo by New
York's Independence Party. Giuliani has accepted while Clinton said
Wednesday that she is still ''working it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party is currently in the midst of a court
battle over its leadership with one faction supporting Buchanan and
the other adamantly opposed to his candidacy. Giuliani has also
spoken out repeatedly against Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
count votes received on third party ballot lines. That can make the
difference in close races.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady stopped in Salamanca on her way to Buffalo where
she was to participate in a town hall forum Wednesday night being
televised nationally by CNN from the University at Buffalo, a state
school.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has attended 76 town hall meetings in New York
City as mayor, is scheduled for his own nationally televised
college forum next week at the Rochester Institute of Technology
when he appears on MSNBC's ''Hardball'' with Chris Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   In Salamanca, Clinton said she had accepted invitations for two
televised debates in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman for Giuliani's campaign,
said the mayor had earlier accepted one of those debates and was in
discussions concerning the other. She said the mayor has made it
clear he wants debates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton wants to have it both ways and no way. She'd like
to debate, but apparently doesn't want the mayor there,'' Glover
Weiss said. ''We've offered to sit down to discuss mutually
feasible dates, but the Clinton campaign won't work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who had never lived in New York until she moved
to the state in January, said that her visit to Cattaraugus County
meant she has visited 56 of the state's 62 counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the end of tomorrow, I will have gone to 58 counties and
I'm trying to get to all 62'' before the Democratic state
convention on May 16, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's important that New York be represented in the
Senate by someone who will represent the entire state,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been making much of the fact that while she has been
crisscrossing the state for months, Giuliani has made only sporadic
forays outside the city, something that has drawn criticism for the
mayor even from his fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Starting her day in Letchworth state park beside the thundering
middle falls, Clinton seemed to press that point.
</P>
<P>
   ''You travel with me, you see New York,'' she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a stop at a dairy farm in Wyoming County, the first
lady called for increasing the estate tax exemption for family
farms and other family-owned businesses to $1.75 million, up from
the current $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ought to be able to leave your land and the bulk of your
fortunes to your children and not to the government,'' she told
more than 100 rural New Yorkers on hand for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton got a warm reception at the farm and at the Democratic
luncheon in Salamanca.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Democrats on hand in Salamanca were impressed by
what they heard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like the Clinton administration,'' said Pete Whalen,
who said he had driven from Bradford, Pa., to see the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the 48-year-old dentist offered something of a
compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's hot,'' Whalen said. ''She must have been a real babe 15
years ago ... Make that 10 years ago.''

<HEADLINE> Court Hears Gay Scout Leaders Case  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices struggled Wednesday
over whether to let the Boy Scouts bar homosexuals from serving as
troop leaders, role models in an organization that teaches its
members to be ''morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Without saying how they will ultimately vote, several justices
voiced skepticism about how far the court could go to force open
admissions upon private organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''In your view, a Catholic organization has to admit Jews'' and
''a Jewish organization has to admit Catholics,'' Justice Stephen
G. Breyer told Evan Wolfson, the lawyer for James Dale of New
Jersey, a former assistant scoutmaster ousted when the organization
learned he is gay. Dale subsequently filed suit against the Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David H. Souter followed
Breyer's line of questioning, asking Wolfson whether his argument
meant the Scouts could be required to admit girls.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia voiced his reservations another way.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think that homosexuality is immoral,'' he said, asking
why the Scouts must accept as a leader ''someone who embodies a
contradiction of their message?''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1910, the Scouts have an oath and law that long have
required members to promise to be ''clean'' and ''morally
straight.'' But no written rule specifically addresses
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said the Scouts are not primarily an ''anti-gay
organization'' and therefore Dale's presence did not burden the
group's message.
</P>
<P>
   Dale did not seek to use his leadership position to advocate
homosexuality, Wolfson added.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's highest court ruled that the Boy Scouts' ban on gay
troop leaders violated a state prohibition on discrimination in
public accommodations. But the Scouts say the state law violates
the organization's rights of free speech and free association under
the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Some justices also had pointed questions for the Scouts' lawyer,
George Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens asked whether a homosexual could be
excluded if he did not publicly declare his sexual orientation but
it was discovered against his wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, said Davidson, arguing that the organization had a right
''to choose the moral leaders for the children in the program.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Boy Scouting is so closely identified with traditional moral
values that the phrase, 'He's a real Boy Scout,' has entered the
language,'' Davidson said. The Scouts believe homosexuality does
not fit that moral code, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Souter told Davidson, ''Mr. Dale is not asking to carry a
banner. He's saying, 'I'm not going to carry a banner.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dale and his parents attended the argument, and he spoke
afterward to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have always loved the Boy Scouts of America,'' he said.
''It's a program that I hold dear to my heart, and I hope to one
day be able to be back in the program.'' Being morally straight
means ''standing up for yourself and being honest,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's argument was the last for the court's current term,
and the justices are expected to decide by July whether the Scouts
had the right to revoke Dale's role as a troop leader.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was 19 and an assistant scoutmaster of a Matawan, N.J.,
troop when in 1990 he was identified in a newspaper article as
co-president of a campus lesbian and gay student group at Rutgers
University.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts' Monmouth Council revoked Dale's registration as an
adult leader, telling him the organization does not allow openly
gay members.
</P>
<P>
   Dale sued, contending the Scouts violated New Jersey's
anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia told Wolfson that if the court ruled in favor of his
argument that gays cannot be banned because the Scouts' overall
message is not anti-homosexual, it may ''induce them to become more
openly and avowedly opposed to homosexual conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said the Scouts may not want to do so because they could
lose heterosexuals who would not support an anti-gay policy.
</P>
<P>
   Giving public accommodations broad freedom to exclude people the
organization believes do not match its message could ''swallow the
civil rights laws,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy questioned how courts
should determine whether a policy was central enough to a group's
goals to allow exclusion of people who oppose the policy.

<HEADLINE> Casino deal may be good for future, causes rift in the present  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. REGIS MOHAWK RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) -- A deal with the
world's biggest gambling company could secure the future for the
St. Regis Mohawk Nation. In the present, though, it is generating
discord among tribal leaders and casting a shadow on a planned $500
million Catskills casino.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday a $12 billion class-action lawsuit against Park
Place Entertainment was filed on behalf of tribal members unhappy
with the new deal.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed in Tribal Court alleges that Park Place
''fraudulently induced'' the Tribal Council to enter into the
agreement and accuses Park Place of interfering with the tribe's
earlier deal with the Catskill Development and the Monticello
Raceway Development Co. to build a casino on the raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Members were seeking damages from Park Place, its chief
executive Arthur Goldberg and chief counsel Clive Cummis.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place, owner of Caesar's Palace and Bally's casinos, agreed
to pay $3 million to the Mohawks for the exclusive rights to
develop and manage future Mohawk casinos in the state. Park Place
also promised to give the tribe 70 percent of any future profits.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place Entertainment's plans include building a major casino
somewhere near but not at Monticello Raceway, the site where
another group has been planning for four years to build a second
casino for the Mohawks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohawks also operate the Akwasasne Mohawk Casino at St.
Regis. Earlier this month, the tribe seized control of the casino
from a private management company they had hired. Tribal leaders
accused the firm of mismanaging the casino, which is drawing sparse
crowds and reportedly losing up to $300,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribal members expressed frustration that the deal with
Park Place was negotiated in secrecy by the Tribal Council and
questioned what it meant for the future of the Catskill casino.
</P>
<P>
   ''They owe the tribe an explanation of what they are doing,''
said Barbara Lazore, a former subchief. ''Here we are on the
doorstep in Monticello and they go and do this ... it was very
disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't mind the chiefs looking at other proposals but you
don't stop the one that is there ready to go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Subchief Harry J. Benedict, one of six tribal officials who
signed the agreement, said tribal leaders feared that Catskill
Development would not get the approval of the National Indian
Gaming Commission to run the Monticello casino. So they worked out
a deal with Park Place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just trying to do what's right. I think we got the best
deal we could,'' Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan involving Catskill Development, approved by the
Interior Department April 6, had been awaiting approval by Gov.
George Pataki when the new deal with Park Place became public last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government gave approval to the raceway plan after
extensive and protracted review of the Mohawks' application. The
tribe's new deal with Park Place, if it involves a new site, would
appear to put the project back to ''square one,'' said Rex Hackler,
a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Interior.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Berman, president of Catskill Development, said he was
''not surprised by Wednesday's lawsuit. He said Park Place's motive
is to derail a Native American gambling operation in Monticello,
which potentially could draw customers away from the casinos 90
miles away in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deal is designed only to protect Park Place's substantial
Atlantic City holdings,'' he charged.
</P>
<P>
   Cummis denied that, saying his company seeks to expand its
market through acquisition and construction. He said the Raceway
site is too small for the casino Park Place has in mind for
somewhere nearby in Sullivan County.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be an exceptional opportunity for the Mohawks
today and for generations hereafter,'' said Cummis, adding that the
state of New York will benefit richly as well.
</P>
<P>
   A call to Cummis for comment on the lawsuit was not immediately
returned.

<HEADLINE> Texas Farmers Seek Cuba Embargo End  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A delegation of Texas farmers, led by a
congressman, ended a three-day visit to Cuba on Wednesday with a
call for Congress to lift the embargo on food and medicine sales to
the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   ''With regard to Cuba, we feel the embargo has failed in
spectacular fashion,'' said Donald Patman, president of the Texas
Farm Bureau, at a news conference. ''Texas farmers and ranchers
could easily and profitably supply many of the products both used
and needed here in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Stenholm, the ranking Democrat on the House
Agriculture Committee, repeated his endorsement of the Ashcroft
amendment -- a measure in Congress to lift restrictions on food and
medical sales to Cuba. The amendment has also won the support of
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-NC, one of Cuba's fiercest critics in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over 90 percent of our (U.S.) farmers and ranchers say that it
is time to lift all unilaterally imposed sanctions on food and
medicine,'' said Stenholm, a Texan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is in the interest of American farmers and the consumers of
the world, including Cuba, that we do not use food for any other
purpose other than feeding people, and the same goes for
medicine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Stenholm said he did not think the issue should be linked
with the case of Elian Gonzalez, he said the agreement between the
U.S. and Cuban governments that the Cuban boy belongs with his
father had helped conditions for talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The atmosphere in both of our countries is very good now for
conducting these discussions,'' Stenholm said.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that U.S. food sales to Cuba could reach $1 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. suppliers would have an advantage over Europeans currently
supplying the Cuban market because of lower transportation costs,
he said. But other aspects of the U.S. embargo on Cuba block
official export credits, complicating any sales.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of U.S. delegations have visited Cuba since
the start of last year, when the Clinton administration modified
restrictions on Cuba to encourage more direct contacts between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
   After leading a delegation of Massachusetts scholars to the
country last week, Democratic Reps. James McGovern and Joseph
Moakley urged President Clinton to ease the embargo, and said the
president should even lead a delegation to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> New and stronger infectious diseases a growing global threat  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four reported outbreaks of unusual infections around the world
have illustrated the surprising potential of new microbes to emerge
and old ones to return with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ''On a good day, we hold them at bay. On a bad day, they're
winning,'' said Dr. Michael Osterholm of ican Inc. of Eden Prairie,
Minn., an Internet information company focusing on infectious
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Osterholm, who was Minnesota's state epidemiologist for 24
years, wrote an editorial on emerging infections in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine, which carried reports on the four
outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   The cases include a Nebraska farm boy who caught drug-resistant
salmonella from infected cows that apparently had been given
antibiotics; Malaysian pig farmers killed by microbes caught from
their animals; and hundreds of Italian schoolchildren sickened by
bacteria-contaminated cold corn salad. Finally, a diabetic Atlanta
boy needed bowel surgery twice for a severe bacterial infection
after eating a holiday chitterlings feast.
</P>
<P>
   ''The microbes are challenging us in ways we wouldn't have
imagined 10 years ago and for which we're not prepared,'' said Dr.
James Hughes, director of the National Center for Infectious
Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria and viruses multiply quickly, and can therefore evolve
rapidly into more aggressive strains.
</P>
<P>
   While Osterholm said it is impossible to predict what will be
''the next HIV,'' another deadly microbe is inevitable. Likewise,
Hughes said it is only a matter of time until another deadly flu
epidemic hits the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bacteria and viruses multiply quickly and keep changing their
genes to be more aggressive pathogens,'' said Dr. Jerrold Ellner,
director of the Center for Emerging Pathogens at the University of
Dentistry and Medicine of New Jersey in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Infectious diseases are the world's No. 1 killer, claiming 13
million lives annually.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly microbes appearing in the last quarter-century
include: Legionnaires' disease, toxic shock syndrome, AIDS,
rodent-borne hantaviruses, the airborne Ebola virus, Lyme disease,
a fatal brain disease in England caught from eating ''mad cows,''
West Nile encephalitis in the New York City area and new,
drug-resistant tuberculosis strains in many cities.
</P>
<P>
   The experts cite numerous factors for the emergence -- and
re-emergence -- of deadly germs, including:
</P>
<P>
   --increased international travel and shipment of food.
</P>
<P>
   --unprecedented population growth cramming people together in
unsanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
   --changes in how food is grown and handled.
</P>
<P>
   --decaying public health infrastructure in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   --more people living with immune systems suppressed by AIDS,
cancer, diabetes and organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
   --increased use of antibiotics in people and livestock, which
contributes to germs' growing resistance to antibiotics.
Potentially deadly staph infections are becoming resistant to even
the antibiotic of last choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine trying to deal with all those at one time,'' Osterholm
said. ''It's like a city fire department trying to put out 30 fires
at one time with one truck.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 Institute of Medicine report spelled out those threats
and the international implications, spurring the CDC and the World
Health Organization to tackle some of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said food safety has been improved, a computerized CDC
network can quickly spot emerging disease outbreaks, and the agency
has a comprehensive plan to address the other threats, but Congress
has only funded half of it.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said people can cut their risk of getting an infectious
disease, through frequent handwashing and careful food handling,
getting all recommended vaccinations, avoiding ticks and taking
antibiotics appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Osterholm and Ellner both recommend people urge health agencies
to beef up surveillance, research and prevention programs. Next
month, Sens. William Frist, R-Tenn., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
plan to introduce legislation to provide more funding for combating
emerging diseases and bioterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the best we can hope for is what we've seen in the
U.S., that we've beaten back the number of infectious diseases
substantially,'' Ellner concluded.

<HEADLINE> Gay Former Scout at Center of Fury  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Walking with his lawyer and parents, James
Dale ignored the anti-gay activists who followed him across the
Supreme Court's broad marble plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know you're hurting. I see it in your eyes,'' said Joel
Gaines of Manassas, Va., shadowing Dale.
</P>
<P>
   ''Save yourself from this awful, horrible lifestyle!'' yelled
Philip Benham of Dallas, president of the anti-abortion group
Operation Rescue. ''Mr. Dale, Jesus will set you free!''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Martino of Washington stood with a cross and a large sign
declaring, ''A homosexual Boy Scout leader is like asking a fox to
guard the chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale has seen and heard such statements before and says they do
not affect him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only person I am is me, and I've always been true to
myself, and I think that's the most important thing,'' he said,
addressing a mob of reporters and curious tourists after the court
heard arguments in his case against the Boys Scouts of America.
</P>
<P>
   Expelled as a scouting supervisor in 1990 when the Boy Scouts
learned he was gay, the former Eagle Scout has waged an eight-year
legal challenge to the scout's claim that gay people do not meet
the organization's standard of ''morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale said he was taught the phrase applied to how scouts treat
other people, not to sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what being 'morally straight' is all about: standing up
for yourself and being honest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, Dale sat silently and watched his lawyer, Evan
Wolfson, field questions from justices, several of them evidently
skeptical the scouts should be ordered not to exclude gays.
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scouts lawyer George A. Davidson argued the organization has
a right ''to choose the moral leaders for the children in the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Dale thanked his parents, Gerald and
Doris Dick of Middletown, N.J., for their support.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're proud of him,'' Mrs. Dick said.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Dale's parents were active in the scouts until their
son's expulsion. His father, a lieutenant colonel in the Army
Reserve, was a scouting commissioner. His wife was a den mother.
</P>
<P>
   Dale, 29, lives in New York City and is advertising director for
a magazine for people who are HIV-positive.

<HEADLINE> Russia FM Launches Security Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on
Wednesday launched a new round of security negotiations with the
Clinton administration. He pledged cooperation despite deep
differences over anti-missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Hedging his bets, Ivanov also met with probable Republican
presidential nominee George W. Bush, outlining Russia's foreign
policy goals and its objections to undermining a 28-year-old
landmark arms control treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want our relations not to be dependent on the direction of
the political situation,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister's three-day visit is designed to prepare
for a smooth summit meeting in Moscow June 4-5 between President
Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov struck a conciliatory stance even while objecting to a
limited missile defense system that Clinton is contemplating and a
far-reaching national defense backed by Bush and other conservative
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says America needs the system to
defend against a missile threat from such countries as North Korea
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are any threats and if those threats are realistic,
then let us work together,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   He said negotiations on new security arrangements started
Wednesday at his lengthy meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, which military experts attended, and continued later at
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Russian goals are limiting the long-range nuclear
warheads in U.S. and Russian arsenals to 1,500, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. and Russian negotiators opened talks in Geneva,
Switzerland, on a treaty that would impose ceilings of 2,000 to
2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that it is important and it is our task to, in
maximum detail, present our arguments and our concerns to the
partners, listen to their position and then elaborate on a joint
decision,'' Ivanov said in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be too premature to speak of the concrete outcome of
those negotiations yet,'' he said. ''But I would like to tell you
that we are holding a sincere, constructive dialogue on the whole
variety of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush said that it was time to ''redefine''
U.S.-Russian relations. Aides said Bush told Ivanov: ''I don't view
you as the enemy and you shouldn't view us as the enemy. That's the
old way of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., pledged to block any
arms-control agreement that Clinton might negotiate with Russia in
the closing months of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
he was fearful Clinton wanted to conclude an arms-reduction
agreement with Moscow as part of his legacy as president.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a few months the American people will go to the polls to
elect a new president -- a president who must have a clean break
from the failed policies of this administration,'' Helms said. ''He
must have the freedom and the flexibility to establish his own
security policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov also vigorously defended Moscow's attempt to suppress a
rebellion in the republic of Chechnya. Along with persistent U.S.
criticism, the top U.N. human rights body this week accused Russia
of widespread violations including indiscriminate use of force.
</P>
<P>
   But Ivanov said Chechnya was run by terrorists and bandits and
there were no human rights for civilians before Russian troops
intervened. The resolution sets a dangerous precedent and
''justifies the activities by the terrorists,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Better Math Instruction Urged  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Why can't the kids learn algebra? Because the
books they use don't explain how algebra calculations will relate
to everyday life, a panel of scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But they could.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just figuring out how to drive a truck route using the least
amount of gas is a mathematical problem,'' said George Nelson,
director of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science's long-term math and science education campaign. ''That's
very important to companies now. They count every ounce.''
</P>
<P>
   Students are increasingly being required to take advanced math,
whether they go to college, said the science group, which created a
review panel of mathematicians and college and K-12 math teachers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the group displayed a dozen inch-thick textbooks
peppered with equations, graphs and word problems. Researchers
called on schools choosing the materials to concentrate more on how
algebra is taught.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 books studied by the group represent the most widely used
of about two-dozen algebra books published, affecting millions of
children in grades six through 12.
</P>
<P>
   No books were considered excellent. Seven of the 12 were deemed
adequate. Five -- including the three most widely used in American
classrooms -- were rated so inadequate that they lack potential for
student learning.
</P>
<P>
   Book publishers Wednesday defended their work, blaming the
demand driven by the math standards set by states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Educational publishers are often caught on the horns of a
dilemma,'' said Stephen Driesler, executive director of the school
division of the Association of American Publishers Inc. ''It is the
teachers and local school officials who decide which textbooks meet
their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools, reviewers said, tend to choose books from the biggest
publishers, with the time and money to tie their materials to what
state lawmakers think pupils should know about algebra and market
these books aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millions of dollars are spent on textbooks; we need more
guidance,'' said Jacqueline Mitchell, Maine's state supervisor of
math instruction. ''School districts just don't have the expertise,
time and money to do this type of analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Newer programs address how algebra -- which explains how
different numbers relate to each other -- helps people accomplish
tasks, such as balancing checkbooks, figuring out which phone
company rates are best, and calculating mileage, said one textbook
writer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not drilling kids,'' Sherry Fraser, director of the
Interactive Mathematics Program, a textbook deemed adequate by the
group and used by 500 schools in 28 states. ''If they are just
mimicking the teacher, they do not see the usefulness of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the books also do a poor job of helping teachers build on
what children already understand or dealing with their
misconceptions, said Gerald Kulm, a Texas A&AMP;M University math
professor who directed the evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the lesson review section of one book simply asks
students to list and define vocabulary words like ''scatter plot''
and ''linear equation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That is clearly not a way to help a child understand what he
just learned,'' Kulm said. ''In algebra, we tend to jump in and
say, 'OK kids, you're grown up, so now we're going to start
throwing abstractions at you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The college and K-12 teachers and mathematicians who reviewed
the books had no relationship with the publishers. The project,
funded by the Carnegie Foundation, will include a website database
of textbook reviews.
</P>
<P>
   More scrutiny of the teaching of algebra comes as U.S. students
struggle to keep up with other nations on math scores. More states
are requiring algebra -- long considered an advanced math class for
college-bound students -- to get a diploma or advance to the next
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said a generation of technical jobs are being lost to
students from other nations whose lessons provide more depth.

<HEADLINE> Crude Sinks; Pork Bellies Advance  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crude oil futures plummeted Wednesday after new data showed an
unexpectedly large rise in U.S. stockpiles, which reached their
highest level in five months.
</P>
<P>
   In other commodity markets, gold fell and pork bellies rose
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month after OPEC approved production increases for
an oil-thirsty world market, the specter of increased crude
supplies is keeping oil prices in check.
</P>
<P>
   Even though officials had said it would take six weeks for the
new oil to show up, data from the Department of Energy early
Wednesday indicated that U.S. crude stocks rose by 5.1 million
barrels last week. The reason apparently is stronger demand from
U.S. refineries, although unofficial OPEC increases may also be
reflected.
</P>
<P>
   The government figure confirmed a separate inventory report late
Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute which showed a 4.25
million-barrel increase.
</P>
<P>
   Both numbers easily exceeded analysts' expectations, touching
off a big selloff in the oil trading pit of the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big build in crude stocks kind of weighed over the
market,'' said Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst for Alaron Trading
Corp. in Chicago. ''The market couldn't get anywhere and it just
marked time all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressures on oil prices, industry consultant
Petrologistics reportedly estimated that crude output from
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries members increased
by 773,000 barrels a day in April, exceeding the new target.
</P>
<P>
   Light, sweet crude for June delivery fell 68 cents, or 3
percent, to $24.65 a barrel. Also, May heating oil rose .81 cent to
75.86 cents a gallon, May unleaded gasoline fell 2.03 cents to
80.29 cents a gallon and May natural gas fell 2.1 cents to $3.089
per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, June Brent crude from the North Sea fell 35 cents to
$22.98 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   On another floor of the New York Merc, gold futures slipped
briefly to a seven-month low of $276.40 an ounce before recovering
slightly to settle at $277.10, down $2.70 or 1 percent for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blamed the strong dollar and the prospect of upcoming
central bank sales by Switzerland and Britain, a portion of which
will take place in May.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen pork bellies rocketed up nearly the limit on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange on the latest evidence of whopping demand for
bacon, which is made from hogs' bellies, and talk of decreasing
fresh supplies, market-watchers said.
</P>
<P>
   With fast-food chains promoting bacon sandwiches and burgers,
pork consumption is higher than it has been in two decades.
Restaurant demand alone for bacon and other pork products has
increased 17 percent in the last year, according to the National
Pork Producers Council.
</P>
<P>
   May pork bellies rose 2.62 cents to 99.72 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Bush Meets Russian Foreign Minister  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush told Russia's foreign minister
Wednesday it was time to move past their nations' ''old way of
thinking,'' but the courtesy call was marked by lingering
differences over Chechnya and U.S. proposals to build a missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't view you as the enemy and you shouldn't view us as the
enemy,'' aides quoted the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee as telling Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov had requested the hour-long session and traveled to the
hotel where Bush was staying before a Republican fund-raiser. He
told Bush that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to build a
marketplace economy and attract U.S. investment.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came two days after Bush made a brief foray into
Mexico for a bridge dedication ceremony and a speech boosting free
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Wednesday that ''these are events that just came to
me.'' But the photos of him with Ivanov and Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo allowed him to display international standing -- and
provided his campaign a welcome contrast to last November's video
of him stammering when a TV reporter asked questions about foreign
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have called him too inexperienced in international
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ''You reverse an image by starting to do things that create a
counterimage,'' said Fred Greenstein, a Princeton University
politics professor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what they need is more than a couple of photo ops of
that sort. Anything that can be done to say, 'Now I'm going to
start diving in and laying out some major programs' will be helpful
to his image,'' the professor added.
</P>
<P>
   After he is nominated at this summer's Republican National
Convention, the Texas governor will start receiving national
security briefings from the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, Bush's Democratic rival, already gets
such briefings. He also serves as co-chairman of five binational
commissions, including one with Russia. He will deliver a foreign
policy speech in Boston on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Politically, it is very, very difficult to look credible on
foreign policy when you're a governor,'' said Paul Begala, who was
a political adviser to then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton when the
Democrat ran for president against Bush's father in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look a little like grade school kids playing a wedding.
You wear the right clothes and say the right things, but nobody
believes it's on the level,'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Bush has been spotted reading foreign policy
books, including a biography of former Secretary of State Dean
Acheson. He currently is reading ''Lenin's Tomb,'' a study of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Bush emerged from his meeting with Ivanov apparently brimming
with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   After a handshake for the departing minister, he said that while
the two talked about their ''dreams and aspirations for our
respective countries,'' they maintained their disagreement over
U.S. proposals to build a national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush favors rewriting the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty so
that the United States can develop a national anti-missile system.
Russia opposes such a move, fearing such a system could undercut
its nuclear defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's part of redefining a post-Cold War era,'' Bush said. ''I
made it very clear that I was going to think in the best interests
of the United States. First and foremost, and the best interest of
our country is to figure out how to keep the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Ivanov also discussed Chechnya. Bush has criticized
Russia's use of force in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a brief exchange in Spanish between Bush and
Ivanov, the one-time Russian ambassador to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov departed without comment, but an aide yelled to a waiting
group of reporters that the session was ''excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, during a news conference at the National Press Club,
Ivanov said he wanted to provide Bush with the ''major directions''
of Russia's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he said he told Bush, as he had told the
administration and would tell congressional leaders later in the
day, that the ABM treaty ''still remains in force and still remains
very topical.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister refused to be drawn into a discussion of
whether Bush's approach to missile defenses posed a greater threat
to the treaty than the limited missile defense Clinton is
considering.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is of no difference who violates it,'' Ivanov said.

   Dow Ends Off 179; Nasdaq Down 87
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled today after the latest sign of
economic growth brought interest rate worries to the foreground for
the first time this week. Blue-chip stocks that have failed to live
up to the market's robust profit expectations led the decline. The
Dow Jones industrial average fell 179.32 to 10,945.50. The Nasdaq
composite was down 87.06 to 3,624.17. A day after the Dow and the
Nasdaq each rose more than 200 points, many buyers retreated to the
sidelines, debating their next moves. Selling gathered momentum in
the final hour of trading as investors unloaded stocks in advance
of a pair of crucial economic reports due out Thursday -- the gross
domestic product and the employment cost index.

   Texas Lockheed Machinists End Strike
</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- After a 17-day strike, Lockheed Martin
machinists in Fort Worth overwhelmingly approved a new contract
today and agreed to return to the assembly line. ''We didn't get
what we wanted, but it's better than a poke in the eye,'' said
Terry Faulkner, 45, a 20-year employee. Members of Local 776 of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers voted
1,514-246 for the new contract, and many expected to return to work
tomorrow. The Fort Worth facility is Lockheed's largest
manufacturer of F-16 fighter jets. Under the new contract, the
workers will get 3 percent annual raises this year and next and a 4
percent raise in 2002, among other things. Shares of Lockheed were
at 24[, down 1 7/16.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer groups today demanded a major
restructuring of the proposed America Online-Time Warner merger,
saying the new company could squelch Internet competitors and would
be connected with another cable giant -- AT&AMP;T. The petition filed
with the Federal Communications Commission by leading consumer
advocates seeks a severing of any ties that would link the two
merging businesses with cable or satellite competitors. The groups
fear that without such measures, consumers will ultimately have
less choice for Internet services and the content they receive. The
consumer groups included Consumer Federation of America, The Media

   Chevron's 1st Quarter Earnings Soar
</P>
<P>
   SAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) -- Chevron Corp.'s first quarter profit
tripled from last year as the company cashed in on a spike in oil
prices that had motorists fuming about the soaring cost of
gasoline. The company reported net income of $1.04 billion, or
$1.59 per share, for the three months ended March 31, compared with
a profit of $329 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time charges and gains, Chevron registered an
operating profit of $1.11 billion, or $1.68 per share -- the highest
for any three-month period in the company's long history. The
earnings easily beat analysts' expectations. Shares of Chevron were
at 86 5/16, up 1{.

plan is gaining momentum. A union proposal to require shareholder
approval of top executives' retirement benefits gained 33 percent
shareholder support at the company's annual meeting. Some retirees
and workers say the company's pension plan for regular employees is
meager when compared to the benefits offered to the board of
directors. Shareholders overwhelmingly approved a three-to-one

million, or 11 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31,
compared to $44.9 million, or 5 cents a share, in the same period a
year ago. Revenues rose 2.5 percent to $3.03 billion. Yesterday,
Federal Communications Commission staff recommended that the
commission approve Viacom's merger deal with CBS, provided the

the technology sector rising by 4 percent. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx
Index ended up 6.15 points at 434.66. London's FTSE-100 Share Index
fell 26.5 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 6256.5, after holding
onto slight gains for much of the trading session. Milan's MibTel
index ended up 0.4 percent, having only begun trading at 1415 GMT
after technical problems crippled the bourse's information
distribution channels before the market opened. Trading closed 30
minutes later than usual, at 1600 GMT, due to the delay.
Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index rose 1.5 percent.

   Plunging Euro Takes Financial Toll
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Although the euro stabilized today after sinking
to a new low against the dollar, its weakness poses a challenge not
only to the European Central Bank but also to economies and
individuals outside the zone of 11 countries that use the single
currency. Among its casualties are British manufacturers, who are
losing sales as they try to compete against goods priced in
chronically weak euros. Americans investing in shares of European
companies also are taking a beating. Swelling regional stock
valuations look a lot less impressive once those shares are
converted from euros into dollars. The euro has plunged almost 23
percent since January 1999, when it was launched. Yesterday, the
euro fell to a record low of 91.62 cents during trading in New
York. It staged a modest rally today, rising to 92.33 cents in late
trading in New York.

<HEADLINE> Clinton calls for breaks on estate taxes for farmers  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELDON, N.Y. (AP) -- Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton
called Wednesday for giving farmers further breaks on their estate
taxes so businesses could be kept in the family.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, visiting a more than 100-year-old dairy farm in
Wyoming County, said the estate tax exemption on family farms and
family-owned businesses should be raised to $1.75 million, up from
the current $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ought to be able to leave your land and the bulk of your
fortunes to your children and not to the government,'' the Democrat
told the audience of more than 100 people at the Almeter Brothers
Dairy Farm, located about 35 miles east of Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   With some of the Almeter Brothers' 289 cows mooing in the
background, Clinton told supporters that she wants ''to be a
senator who represents the entire state.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know how tough it is in agriculture right now and I know the
challenges you are up against,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reducing estate taxes, Clinton said she would
also work to lower utility costs, taxes and labor costs that make
farming difficult in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a fleece jacket to ward off the morning chill, the
first lady took questions for about a half hour from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought she did a great job, especially answering questions
off the cuff,'' said Harry Boshart, a retired construction worker
and a Democrat. Boshart said he would definitely be voting for
Clinton in November.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is running for the Senate against Republican New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the Giuliani campaign said ''Mrs. Clinton
flip-flopped on yet another issue today in Wyoming County,
pandering to New York state farmers by suddenly deciding she
supports a reduction in the estate tax'' and that ''just last year,
Mrs. Clinton strongly opposed a Republican-sponsored tax bill that
included a 10-year phase-out of the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady told the farmers Wednesday that one of her themes
as she moves across the state is to remind New Yorkers that
agriculture is the state's No. 1 industry and must be protected.

<HEADLINE> Former Head of MGM Rothman Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former MGM chairman Frank Rothman, considered
one of the nation's top sports and entertainment attorneys, has
died. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman, whose wife is U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer,
died Tuesday as a result of complications following undisclosed
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman had handled lawsuits involving the National Football
League, the National Basketball Association and the Professional
Golfers Association. His entertainment industry clients included
Warner Bros., Walt Disney Co., Paramount Pictures, Home Box Office
and 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman litigated a number of landmark cases, including one
involving basketball player Spencer Haywood that led to the
''hardship rule,'' which allows undergraduates to leave college
before four years and play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   He also represented a number of teams, including the Boston
Celtics, the Seattle Supersonics, the Portland Trailblazers and the
Los Angeles Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was one of the top lawyers in the area and one of the
ablest and most respected,'' said Stephen Reinhardt, a 9th Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals judge. ''For many years, he was the NFL's
chief antitrust attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothman graduated from Fairfax High School and attended
University of California, Los Angeles. He graduated from the
University of Southern California Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Kerkorian, MGM's principal stockholder, asked Rothman in
1982 to take the company's top job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kirk had been a longtime client of my father,'' Steven Rothman
said. ''My father saw the job as a challenge. That was my dad. His
attitude was: 'Let's try this.'''
</P>
<P>
   After four years as MGM chairman and chief executive, Rothman
decided to return to law.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman was the NFL's lead attorney for more than a decade. He
represented the league in a number of high-profile lawsuits,
including an antitrust claim brought by the United States Football
League in which Rothman scored a significant victory for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   A jury decided in the 1986 verdict that although the NFL was a
monopoly, the league did not prevent the USFL from obtaining a
network television contract. The USFL, which sought $1 billion, was
awarded $1.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife and son, Rothman is survived by two daughters,
Susan Rothman of Los Angeles and Robin Wilson of Georgia.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall Slightly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The price of 30-year Treasury bonds fell
slightly Wednesday in cautious trading ahead of Thursday's release
of government reports on economic activity and wages in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell [ point,
or $1.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, rose to 5.94 percent from 5.93 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was light as investors awaited news of the direction of
the U.S. economy. The government on Thursday is scheduled to report
on the gross domestic product and the employment cost index, both
for the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy continues its fast pace, it would reinforce
expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at
its May 16 meeting. Higher interest rates hurt the allure of bonds,
which pay a fixed rate of return.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader bond market, short-term notes fell between 1/32
point and 1/16 point, while intermediate notes were unchanged to
down 1/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information
service.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.74 percent as the
discount fell 0.04 percentage point from Tuesday to 5.59 percent.
Six-month yields were 5.99 as the discount rate fell 0.01 point to
5.75 percent. One-year yields were 6.10 percent as the discount
fell 0.01 percentage point to 5.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, remained unchanged at 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3/32 point to 94 23/32. The average
yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.98 percent.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Meets With U.N. Diplomats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic met Wednesday with Russian and Chinese diplomats, who
made a surprise stop in Belgrade ahead of a U.N. Security Council
fact-finding mission to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov and deputy Chinese Ambassador
Shen Guofang, who vehemently opposed NATO's 78-day air campaign
against Yugoslavia last year, didn't discuss the mission with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   They will be joined by the rest of the delegation in Kosovo on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, which is part of Yugoslavia, has been under control of
the United Nations and NATO since last June 12, when Milosevic
agreed to withdraw his troops from the province and allow
deployment of international forces in exchange for the alliance
halting the air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO launched the air campaign in March 1999 to force Milosevic
to end his yearlong crackdown against independence-minded ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China, both permanent members on the U.N. Security
Council, opposed the NATO intervention and pressured the United
States last year to accept language in the U.N. Security Council
resolution that established Kosovo's peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries are also among the few that still maintain
links with Milosevic, although the U.N. tribunal indicted him last
year for war crimes during the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Lavrov and Shen also met Wednesday with Yugoslavia's deputy
premier, Nikola Sainovic, who was indicted along with Milosevic
last year.
</P>
<P>
   A statement after the meeting said that Sainovic accused the
U.N. administration in Kosovo of being responsible for the
''present grave situation in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs and other non-Albanians have faced harassment by ethnic
Albanian extremists since last June. Scores were killed or went
missing, while some 250,000 people fled the province.

<HEADLINE> Official: China-Taiwan War Unlikely  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS CALO MEDINA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- China's stepped up bomber flights and
naval maneuvers set off a dispute Wednesday between Taiwanese
defense officials and experts on whether the moves were an attempt
to intimidate Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the military activity detected by Taiwan's
intelligent services made the front pages of the island's leading
newspapers Wednesday, sending Taiwan's jittery stock market down
4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said the drills might be a prelude to
threatening war games to intimidate the island as its new
president, Chen Shui-bian, prepares to take office May 20. Chen has
said he has no plans to seek independence unless China attacks to
force a reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Tao-yu, vice-minister of defense, doubted that the recent
military maneuvers were unusual. He said China holds exercises
every spring because of good weather.
</P>
<P>
   But Sun said the military had to inform the public ''to remind
the people of the concept of national defense'' on the island that
split with China 51 years ago amid civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Ting Yu-chou, chairman of the National Security Bureau, said
Taiwan's military ''was jumping to conclusions,'' the United
Evening News reported. Ting said the air drills were normal and
there were no indications of large-scale ground exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Lin Chong-pin, vice-chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
which handles Taiwan's China policy, said the maneuvers were part
of the mainland's psychological warfare against the island. Beijing
repeatedly has threatened to attack if Taiwan refuses to reunify
and declares independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, an expert on China's People's Liberation Army, said Beijing
was trying to intimidate Taiwan into starting reunification talks
because Chinese leaders lack the confidence to act on their threats
of an all-out war with the island.
</P>
<P>
   War, Lin said, was unlikely because China's leaders fear war
would bring social unrest, economic upheaval and threaten their
hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders also realize that war with Taiwan would involve
the United States, which has shown ''a more positive attitude''
toward the island despite its recognition of Beijing, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
   Former military chief Hau Pei-tsun, who was visited by
president-elect Chen, said that the drills ''looked like normal air
force exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen in turn urged China to use peaceful methods to improve ties
. ''We want peace, harmony, cooperation,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Walking with his lawyer and parents, James
Dale coolly ignored the anti-gay activists who followed him across
the Supreme Court's broad marble plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know you're hurting. I see it in your eyes,'' said Joel
Gaines of Manassas, Va., shadowing Dale's every step.
</P>
<P>
   ''Save yourself from this awful, horrible lifestyle!'' yelled
the Rev. Philip Benham of Dallas, Texas, president of the
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. ''Mr. Dale, Jesus will set
you free!''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Martino of Washington stood with a cross and a large sign
declaring, ''A homosexual boy scout leader is like asking a fox to
guard the chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dale by now is a veteran of such passionate reactions to his
case. Addressing a mob of reporters and curious tourists, Dale
said, ''The only person I am is me, and I've always been true to
myself, and I think that's the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Expelled as a scouting supervisor in 1990 when the Boy Scouts of
America learned he was gay, the Eagle Scout sued two years later.
He has waged an eight-year legal challenge to the scout policy that
gay people do not meet the standard of ''morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale said he was taught that the phrase ''morally straight''
applied to how scouts treat other people -- not to their sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what being morally straight is all about: standing up
for yourself and being honest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the previous hour, Dale had sat silently and watched his
lawyer, Evan Wolfson, get grilled by Supreme Court justices,
several of them evidently skeptical that the scouts should be
ordered not to exclude gays.
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scouts lawyer George A. Davidson argued that the Scouts have
a right ''to choose the moral leaders for the children in the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Dale thanked his parents, Gerald and
Doris Dick of Middletown, N.J., for their support.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're proud of him,'' said Doris.
</P>
<P>
   Agreed Gerald, ''I've followed him through the scout program,
supported him completely, and we just want the very best for him
and for the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of Dale's parents were active in the scouts until their
son's expulsion. His father, a lieutenant colonel in the Army
reserve, was a scouting commissioner. His mother was a den mother.
</P>
<P>
   Dale grew up in Middletown and attended the Marine Academy of
Science and Technology in Sandy Hook.
</P>
<P>
   Between his freshman and sophomore years at Rutgers University,
Dale accepted that he was gay. He joined the campus gay and lesbian
organization, becoming co-president after three months. In that
capacity, he spoke at a 1990 conference on the struggles of lesbian
and gay adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper story on the conference quoted Dale. The story
prompted the Monmouth Council of the Boy Scouts to revoke his
registration as assistant scoutmaster for Troop 73 in Matawan.
</P>
<P>
   Dale, now 29, lives in New York City and is advertising director
for a magazine for people who are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have always loved the Boy Scouts of America,'' Dale declared
after Wednesday's hearing. ''It's a program that I hold dear to my
heart, and I hope to one day be able to be back in the program.''

<HEADLINE> Math Textbooks Called Inadequate  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Why can't the kids learn algebra? Because the
books they use don't explain how algebra calculations will relate
to everyday life, a panel of scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But they could.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just figuring out how to drive a truck route using the least
amount of gas is a mathematical problem,'' said George Nelson,
director of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science's long-term math and science education campaign. ''That's
very important to companies now. They count every ounce.''
</P>
<P>
   Students are increasingly being required to take advanced math,
whether they go to college, said the science group, which created a
review panel of mathematicians and college and K-12 math teachers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the group displayed a dozen inch-thick textbooks
peppered with equations, graphs and word problems. Researchers
called on schools choosing the materials to concentrate more on how
algebra is taught.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 books studied by the group represent the most widely used
of about two-dozen algebra books published, affecting millions of
children in grades six through 12.
</P>
<P>
   No books were considered excellent. Seven of the 12 were deemed
adequate. Five -- including the three most widely used in American
classrooms -- were rated so inadequate that they lack potential for
student learning.
</P>
<P>
   Book publishers Wednesday defended their work, blaming the
demand driven by the math standards set by states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Educational publishers are often caught on the horns of a
dilemma,'' said Stephen Driesler, executive director of the school
division of the Association of American Publishers Inc. ''It is the
teachers and local school officials who decide which textbooks meet
their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools, reviewers said, tend to choose books from the biggest
publishers, with the time and money to tie their materials to what
state lawmakers think pupils should know about algebra and market
these books aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millions of dollars are spent on textbooks; we need more
guidance,'' said Jacqueline Mitchell, Maine's state supervisor of
math instruction. ''School districts just don't have the expertise,
time and money to do this type of analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Newer programs address how algebra -- which explains how
different numbers relate to each other -- helps people accomplish
tasks, such as balancing checkbooks, figuring out which phone
company rates are best, and calculating mileage, said one textbook
writer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not drilling kids,'' Sherry Fraser, director of the
Interactive Mathematics Program, a textbook deemed adequate by the
group and used by 500 schools in 28 states. ''If they are just
mimicking the teacher, they do not see the usefulness of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the books also do a poor job of helping teachers build on
what children already understand or dealing with their
misconceptions, said Gerald Kulm, a Texas A&AMP;M University math
professor who directed the evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the lesson review section of one book simply asks
students to list and define vocabulary words like ''scatter plot''
and ''linear equation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That is clearly not a way to help a child understand what he
just learned,'' Kulm said. ''In algebra, we tend to jump in and
say, 'OK kids, you're grown up, so now we're going to start
throwing abstractions at you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The college and K-12 teachers and mathematicians who reviewed
the books had no relationship with the publishers. The project,
funded by the Carnegie Foundation, will include a website database
of textbook reviews.
</P>
<P>
   More scrutiny of the teaching of algebra comes as U.S. students
struggle to keep up with other nations on math scores. More states
are requiring algebra -- long considered an advanced math class for
college-bound students -- to get a diploma or advance to the next
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said a generation of technical jobs are being lost to
students from other nations whose lessons provide more depth.

<HEADLINE> Justices quiz both sides in gay Boy Scout leader case  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices struggled Wednesday
over whether to let the Boy Scouts bar homosexuals from serving as
troop leaders, role models in an organization that teaches its
members to be ''morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Without saying how they will ultimately vote, several justices
voiced skepticism about how far the court could go to force open
admissions upon private organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''In your view, a Catholic organization has to admit Jews'' and
''a Jewish organization has to admit Catholics,'' Justice Stephen
G. Breyer told Evan Wolfson, the lawyer for James Dale of New
Jersey, a former assistant scoutmaster ousted when the organization
learned he is gay. Dale subsequently sued the Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David H. Souter followed
Breyer's line of questioning, asking Wolfson whether his argument
meant the Scouts could be required to admit girls.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia voiced his reservations another way.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think that homosexuality is immoral,'' he said, asking
why the Scouts must accept as a leader ''someone who embodies a
contradiction of their message?''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1910, the Scouts have an oath and law that long have
required members to promise to be ''clean'' and ''morally
straight.'' But no written rule specifically addresses
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said the Scouts are not primarily an ''anti-gay
organization'' and therefore Dale's presence did not burden the
group's message.
</P>
<P>
   Dale did not seek to use his leadership position to advocate
homosexuality, Wolfson added.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's highest court ruled that the Boy Scouts' ban on gay
troop leaders violated a state prohibition on discrimination in
public accommodations. But the Scouts say the state law violates
the organization's rights of free speech and free association under
the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Some justices also had pointed questions for the Scouts' lawyer,
George Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens asked whether a homosexual could be
excluded if he did not publicly declare his sexual orientation but
it was discovered against his wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, said Davidson, arguing that the organization had a right
''to choose the moral leaders for the children in the program.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Boy Scouting is so closely identified with traditional moral
values that the phrase, 'He's a real Boy Scout,' has entered the
language,'' Davidson said. The Scouts believe homosexuality does
not fit that moral code, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Souter told Davidson, ''Mr. Dale is not asking to carry a
banner. He's saying, 'I'm not going to carry a banner.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dale and his parents attended the argument, and he spoke
afterward to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have always loved the Boy Scouts of America,'' he said.
''It's a program that I hold dear to my heart, and I hope to one
day be able to be back in the program.'' Being morally straight
means ''standing up for yourself and being honest,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's argument was the last for the court's current term,
and the justices are expected to decide by July whether the Scouts
had the right to revoke Dale's role as a troop leader.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was 19 and an assistant scoutmaster of a Matawan, N.J.,
troop when in 1990 he was identified in a newspaper article as
co-president of a campus lesbian and gay student group at Rutgers
University.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts' Monmouth Council revoked Dale's registration as an
adult leader, telling him the organization does not allow openly
gay members.
</P>
<P>
   Dale sued, contending the Scouts violated New Jersey's
anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia told Wolfson that if the court ruled in favor of his
argument that gays cannot be banned because the Scouts' overall
message is not anti-homosexual, it may ''induce them to become more
openly and avowedly opposed to homosexual conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said the Scouts may not want to do so because they could
lose heterosexuals who would not support an anti-gay policy.
</P>
<P>
   Giving public accommodations broad freedom to exclude people the
organization believes do not match its message could ''swallow the
civil rights laws,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy questioned how courts
should determine whether a policy was central enough to a group's
goals to allow exclusion of people who oppose the policy.

<HEADLINE> Euro Up After New Low Vs. Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro stablized somewhat Wednesday as traders
pulled back from a sharp selloff the day before that sent Europe's
single currency to an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was quoted at 92.33 cents in late New York trading, up
from 92.08 cents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 106.27 Japanese yen in New York,
up from 105.81 yen.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is taking a bit of a breather,'' said Tim Fox,
currency analyst at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the euro fell below 93 cents for the first time
ever, then dipped below 92 cents during heavy selling before
recovering slightly late in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's session was less volatile, but the concerns for the
European economy and political environment that led to Tuesday's
selloff remain, according to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perceptions remain unchanged. There's a pervasive cynicism
about the euro,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has come under pressure in recent weeks amid questions
over how European authorities will defend the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, like many foreign exchange analysts, expects the European
Central Bank to raise interest rates at its meeting Thursday in an

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 179; Nasdaq Down 81  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled Wednesday after the latest sign
of economic growth brought interest rate worries to the foreground
for the first time this week. Blue chip stocks that have failed to
live up to the market's robust profit expectations led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 179.32 to close at
10,945.50.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index lost 81.14 to 3,630.09, and the
broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 16.15 to 1,460.99.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Dow and the Nasdaq each rose more than 200
points, many buyers retreated to the sidelines, debating their next
moves. Selling gathered momentum in the final hour of trading as
investors unloaded stocks in advance of a pair of crucial economic
reports due out Thursday -- the gross domestic product and the
employment cost index.
</P>
<P>
   The market was rattled Wednesday by a Commerce Department report
that orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket items rose during
March, the first increase this year.
</P>
<P>
   The durable goods report revived fears that the Federal Reserve
will continue raising interest rates in an effort to force a
slowdown of the economy. The Fed has raised rates five times since
last June, and many economists expect the Fed to bump rates up
again at its next policy-making meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Fed is looking for signs of moderation, they won't find
it'' in the durable goods report, said David Orr, chief economist
at First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The report fed worries that Thursday's reports will show the
economy is growing too quickly. Most analysts expect the GDP report
to reveal that the economy grew at a 6 percent rate in the first
quarter -- too fast for the Fed's comfort, but not as brisk as the
7.3 percent rate posted in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The government will also release the latest employment cost
index -- a gauge of wage pressures which Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
considers a crucial barometer of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a latent fear that if those numbers are stronger than
expected, it will force the Fed to be aggressive about raising
rates,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at
Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about rising interest rates hurt financial services
stocks, which typically suffer when higher rates crimp lending
volume. Citigroup fell 2 to 62 1/2 and J.P. Morgan lost 3 3/8 to
134 9/16, weighing on the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued punishing the blue-chip companies that
failed to impress Wall Street with their profit reports. Procter &AMP;
Gamble fell 3 1/2 to 60 3/4 and 3M fell 4 7/8 to 88 15/16, the
second straight decline for each.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer slipped 1 to 29 1/4. Late Tuesday, the computer
maker reported that excluding gains in its investment portfolio,
first-quarter net income and revenues were virtually unchanged from
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Online auctioneer eBay gave up early gains and finished down 4
5/16 at 149 1/4. The company's first-quarter operating results
exceeded Wall Street expectations as the amount of merchandise sold
on its site surpassed $1 billion for the first time. Also, eBay
announced plans to split its stock 2-for-1.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Stovall, senior equity strategist at Standard &AMP; Poor's, said
he expects the technology sector to regain leadership of the market
in the coming quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're advising investors to take advantage of periodic price
weakness in technology,'' he said. ''Those companies will have the
strongest profit growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.21
billion shares, compared with 1.28 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.79 to 484.24.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.8 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 1.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 0.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Scout at Center of Gay Policy Fury  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Walking with his lawyer and parents, James
Dale ignored the anti-gay activists who followed him across the
Supreme Court's broad marble plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know you're hurting. I see it in your eyes,'' said Joel
Gaines of Manassas, Va., shadowing Dale.
</P>
<P>
   ''Save yourself from this awful, horrible lifestyle!'' yelled
Philip Benham of Dallas, president of the anti-abortion group
Operation Rescue. ''Mr. Dale, Jesus will set you free!''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Martino of Washington stood with a cross and a large sign
declaring, ''A homosexual Boy Scout leader is like asking a fox to
guard the chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale has seen and heard such statements before and says they do
not affect him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only person I am is me, and I've always been true to
myself, and I think that's the most important thing,'' he said,
addressing a mob of reporters and curious tourists after the court
heard arguments in his case against the Boy Scouts of America.
</P>
<P>
   Expelled as a scouting supervisor in 1990 when the Boy Scouts
learned he was gay, the Eagle Scout has waged an eight-year legal
challenge to the scout's claim that gay people do not meet the
organization's standard of ''morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale said he was taught the phrase applied to how scouts treat
other people, not to sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what being 'morally straight' is all about: standing up
for yourself and being honest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, Dale sat silently and watched his lawyer, Evan
Wolfson, field questions from justices, several of them evidently
skeptical the scouts should be ordered not to exclude gays.
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scouts lawyer George A. Davidson argued the organization has
a right ''to choose the moral leaders for the children in the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Dale thanked his parents, Gerald and
Doris Dick of Middletown, N.J., for their support. Dale changed his
last name before the controversy arose.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're proud of him,'' Mrs. Dick said.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Dale's parents were active in the scouts until their
son's expulsion. His father, a lieutenant colonel in the Army
Reserve, was a scouting commissioner. His wife was a den mother.
</P>
<P>
   Dale, 29, lives in New York City and is advertising director for
a magazine for people who are HIV-positive.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Official Derides Castro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top State Department official on Wednesday
called Fidel Castro's actions in the Elian Gonzalez case
''absolutely deplorable'' and said the United States will persist
in its attempts to isolate Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State Peter Romero accused the Cuban
leader of trying to use the boy's misfortune to create ''a
diplomatic-political clash'' with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''He manipulated this for complete domestic purposes,'' Romero
said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments were the most strident by an administration
official since Elian arrived in South Florida last November after
being rescued at sea during an ill-fated boat trip that claimed the
life of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In the five months since Elian's arrival on U.S. soil, Castro
has organized a series of mass anti-American demonstrations
demanding the boy's return to the island. He also ordered the
construction of an anti-American monument near the U.S. diplomatic
mission in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Castro went on the offensive even though he and the Clinton
administration shared the view that Elian should go back to Cuba
rather than remain with relatives in South Florida. His fate will
be decided by a court.
</P>
<P>
   Romero, who heads the State Department's bureau of Western
Hemisphere affairs, also said Castro engaged in ''a most cynical
attempt'' to pass himself off as a family man during the Elian
case.
</P>
<P>
   He said the administration intends to retain economic sanctions
and other kinds of instruments to isolate the Cuban regime, which
he described as ''renegade'' and ''undemocratic.''

<HEADLINE> Russia, US Launch Security Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on
Wednesday launched a new round of security negotiations with the
Clinton administration. He pledged cooperation despite deep
differences over anti-missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Hedging his bets, Ivanov also met with probable Republican
presidential nominee George W. Bush, outlining Russia's foreign
policy goals and its objections to undermining a 28-year-old
landmark arms control treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want our relations not to be dependent on the direction of
the political situation,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister's three-day visit is designed to prepare
for a smooth summit meeting in Moscow June 4-5 between President
Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov struck a conciliatory stance even while objecting to a
limited missile defense system that Clinton is contemplating and a
far-reaching national defense backed by Bush and other conservative
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says America needs the system to
defend against a missile threat from such countries as North Korea
and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are any threats and if those threats are realistic,
then let us work together,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   He said negotiations on new security arrangements started
Wednesday at his lengthy meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, which military experts attended, and continued later at
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Russian goals are limiting the long-range nuclear
warheads in U.S. and Russian arsenals to 1,500, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. and Russian negotiators opened talks in Geneva,
Switzerland, on a treaty that would impose ceilings of 2,000 to
2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that it is important and it is our task to, in
maximum detail, present our arguments and our concerns to the
partners, listen to their position and then elaborate on a joint
decision,'' Ivanov said in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be too premature to speak of the concrete outcome of
those negotiations yet,'' he said. ''But I would like to tell you
that we are holding a sincere, constructive dialogue on the whole
variety of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush said that it was time to ''redefine''
U.S.-Russian relations. Aides said Bush told Ivanov: ''I don't view
you as the enemy and you shouldn't view us as the enemy. That's the
old way of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., pledged to block any
arms-control agreement that Clinton might negotiate with Russia in
the closing months of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
he was fearful Clinton wanted to conclude an arms-reduction
agreement with Moscow as part of his legacy as president.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a few months the American people will go to the polls to
elect a new president -- a president who must have a clean break
from the failed policies of this administration,'' Helms said. ''He
must have the freedom and the flexibility to establish his own
security policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov also vigorously defended Moscow's attempt to suppress a
rebellion in the republic of Chechnya. Along with persistent U.S.
criticism, the top U.N. human rights body this week accused Russia
of widespread violations including indiscriminate use of force.
</P>
<P>
   But Ivanov said Chechnya was run by terrorists and bandits and
there were no human rights for civilians before Russian troops
intervened. The resolution sets a dangerous precedent and
''justifies the activities by the terrorists,'' he said.

Columbine Tapes Released to Public
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- To the horror of the Columbine victims' families, law
enforcement authorities released video today of the dead and the dying.
Jefferson County District Attorney Frank Hutfless released the tapes to the
school victims' families on Tuesday under a court order after a judge ruled that
the relatives have an "undeniable and compelling public interest" in seeing the
footage. The county attorney also made copies available to the public today for
$25. The tapes depict the carnage of April 20, 1999, when two students killed 12
classmates and a teacher, wounded 23 others and committed suicide.

Elian, Relatives Meeting Delay Urged
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After spending 2 1/2 hours with Elian Gonzalez, a child
psychologist for the government today recommended delaying any visit between the
6-year-old Cuban refugee and his Miami relatives until the relatives reconcile
with his father. But Miami child psychologist Dr. Lidya Usategui contended Dr.
Paulina F. Kernberg spent too little time with Elian for a proper evaluation.
Dr. Jose Carro, president of the Cuban Pediatric Society in Exile, said, "In our
view, he (Elian) continues to suffer.... Elian should have access to his family
from Miami."

Vt. Gov. Signs Nation's 1st Gay Union Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Gov. Howard Dean today signed a first-in-the-nation
law that grants gay couples nearly all of the benefits of marriage. The state
law will allow gay couples to form civil unions beginning July 1. That will
entitle them to all of the 300 or so rights and responsibilities available to
married couples under Vermont law in such areas as taxes, inheritance and
medical decision-making. No state has gone further than Vermont is giving gay
couples something approximating marriage. The bill came about after the Vermont
Supreme Court unanimously ruled in December that gay couples were being
unconstitutionally denied the benefits of marriage.

<HEADLINE> Bush Pursues Women Voters  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They said it with flowers, surrounded by earth
tones, on cushy couches that could have come from the Oprah Winfrey
show.
</P>
<P>
   A backdrop filled with the faces of young girls declared, ''For
our daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., who has long counseled GOP
colleagues on how to draw female votes, made it clear that the
party's presumptive presidential nominee will listen to women's
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women across the country will have a voice in a George Bush
administration,'' said Dunn, founder of the Republican Women
Leaders Forum that hosted Wednesday's event.
</P>
<P>
   Women are a battleground voting bloc and, although undecided
women tend to vote for Democrats, polls show Bush in striking
distance of Democrat Al Gore among them.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, hosted the talk
show-style forum at the Ronald Reagan Building International Trade
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife Laura guest-starred, while three groups of
students and their mentors joined them to discuss his campaign
themes: Educating all children, preventing substance abuse and
encouraging volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
   The session highlighted Bush's ''Texas Reading Initiative,'' a
four-year old program in which children are expected to read at
least at their grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Bush listened to the students' stories of learning to read in
English and Spanish and of volunteering, but the Texas governor's
ambition shined through.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm an incredibly optimistic person about your future -- mine
too,'' Bush told students who fight substance abuse among their
peers as part of the ''Kids Saving Kids,'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Face-to-face with Elena Douglass, a Houston second-grader who is
learning to read in English and Spanish, Bush asked: ''How is it
here in the nation's capital, you having a good time?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes sir,'' Elena answered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Me too,'' Bush replied with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the session, he exclaimed: ''I can't wait to be
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   But before that happens, Republicans acknowledge Bush must go
further than his GOP predecessors in closing the gender gap among
women against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio told the
conference the party has a fair shot at women voters, who will be
crucial to GOP victories in the November presidential and
congressional elections races that he said are on track to be the
closest in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   Women, he said, split their loyalties between Gore and Bush
depending on the issue. Polls show that Bush is strong among women
on education, tax cuts and defense, while Gore is strongest on
health care, saving Medicare and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have your work cut out for you,'' Fabrizio said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee later Wednesday said that in
Texas, Bush has a poor record on appointing women, on domestic
violence deaths and employment rates among women.

<HEADLINE> Miami Elian Protesters Head to DC  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Shops reopened and people returned to work
Wednesday, a day after a general strike in Little Havana to protest
the seizure of Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   But the protests over the pre-dawn raid by federal agents are
far from over. About 80 people, including college students and
others upset with the government's action, left for Washington,
D.C., in a caravan of cars and buses Wednesday. Messages written on
the windows read: ''Justice for Elian,'' ''Elian's S.W.A.T.'' and
''We'll never forget you Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the trip's organizers, Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera of a
group called New Generation Cuba, said the protesters would rally
outside the White House at noon Thursday. They hoped to give
President Clinton a letter asking for an investigation into what
they called the Immigration and Naturalization Service's abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   The group was also trying to get a permit to protest outside the
Cuban diplomatic mission.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was seized by armed federal agents Saturday morning from
the home of his Miami relatives, who cared for the 6-year-old boy
after he was rescued from the waters off Florida in November and
are fighting to block his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was reunited with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in
Washington. They are now staying at the secluded Wye River
conference center on Maryland's Eastern Shore while awaiting a
federal appeals court ruling on whether Elian should be granted an
asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday -- called ''Martes Muerte'' or ''Dead Tuesday'' in
Little Havana -- businesses kept iron gates closed, workers stayed
home and students skipped school.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sixto, 21, did not go to his job at his parents'
factory, which was closed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Miami-Dade Community College student said he
learned about the trip to Washington just an hour before it was to
leave. He quickly packed a bag, knowing he would miss two days of
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to help in any way I can,'' he said.

   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Baseball Is Seeing More Home Runs  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   With America in the throes of its biggest home-run epidemic
ever, baseball commissioner Bud Selig is pleading for calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's just see how this plays out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everywhere and every moment the game is on TV, somebody
goes deep. In one seven-game homestand, Toronto and two visitors
divvied up 33 home runs. Earlier this month, a record 57 left the
yard in one day's worth of games. Sunday, two switch-hitting
Yankees each homered from both sides of the plate. Old-timers
regard these as signs of the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course we have concerns,'' Selig said from his Milwaukee
home. ''We always have concerns. But at this stage we're just
sitting back and monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig just hired scientists to take a fresh look at the
baseball. But Liz Daus, spokeswoman for Rawlings, the Fenton,
Mo.-based sporting goods manufacturer, said that won't yield
anything new.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're made in the same place with the same materials and the
same way since we shifted production to our Costa Rica plant 10
years ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Selig talked on the telephone Tuesday night, Arizona
wrapped up a 10-2 win over the Phillies with Kelly Stinnett hitting
two home runs. It was the second time he managed the feat in a few
days. There was a time when Stinnett had trouble cracking an egg --
provided it was thrown off a mound. In his first 168 big-league
games, he had six HRs. Two years ago, he hit 11 in 92 games; then
14 in 88 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Stinnett showed up for camp with 225 pounds layered
on a buffed 5-foot-11 frame. He has six HRs in his last 40 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I worked my tail off in the offseason to get stronger and it's
paying off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There wouldn't be cause for alarm if Stinnett were the only
unknown closing in on proven long-ball performers like Mark
McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr. Instead, the opposite is
true.
</P>
<P>
   American League leader Jermaine Dye had just 51 home runs in his
first four seasons and 27 last season. He has nine already. Kansas
City teammate Mike Sweeney had 41 the last four years and 22 last
season. He's got seven this month.
</P>
<P>
   A few more hitters with similar numbers and stories: Tony
Battista, Jose Cruz Jr., and Geoff Jenkins. Remember those names;
they're all on pace to hit 50 homers. Suddenly, the half-century
club never felt less exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hirdt of Elias Sports Bureau, one of savviest statistical
analysts around, has heard the whispers about this being
choreographed, about Selig reckoning that if one McGwire-Sosa duel
sells tickets, dozens of them will sell plenty more.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Hirdt believes no one is pulling strings is because
there's no need. Now, every job in baseball pays so well that home
runs are included in the job description. In the old days, only
home-run hitters drove Cadillacs. These days, middle infielders
give them to personal trainers for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Hirdt sees all the usual accomplices being blamed for the power
surge: juiced baseballs, shrinking ballyards, pitching thinned by
expansion, even dense Canadian hardwood in bats. Only one trend
genuinely troubles him.
</P>
<P>
   ''What strikes me as non-cyclical is that hitters have an
incentive to bulk up -- more weight-training and dietary supplements
-- and there's not a corresponding advantage available to pitchers.
It doesn't help them to get much bigger and they can't be throwing
year-round.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difference is noticeable already. If you took team
pictures with the shirts off,'' Hirdt said, ''you'd have no trouble
telling the 14 position players apart from the 11 pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season was the game's most prolific by any measure -- 5,528
HRs in all, an average of 2.3 per game. This season, the average is
2.6 per game, a pace that would yield 6,800 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Selig is hoping a handful of big-name pitchers will return from
injury soon and bring the numbers back in line. Other people see
days of warmer weather and worn-out pitchers ahead and believe they
will only get more skewed. While the commissioner talks about the
baseball, others think he should consider raising the mound,
forcing umpires to earn their keep by calling strikes and giving
pitchers a half-chance to get through an inning unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   They mean that literally.
</P>
<P>
   Making home runs seem dull may not be baseball's worst problem.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between the mound and batter's box seems to be narrowing
and a few pitchers already suffered broken bones after being hit
with line drives.
</P>
<P>
   It's no longer just their pride that's getting hurt.

<HEADLINE> March Durable Goods Orders Rebound  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders for big-ticket goods in March posted
their first increase this year after two months of decline,
providing fresh evidence of an economy hot enough to force another
increase in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Orders for durable goods -- items expect to last at least three
years -- rose a bigger-than-expected 2.6 percent last month to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $215.2 billion, led by a heavy
demand for electronic products. That reversed the pattern of the
two previous months in which orders declined, the Commerce
Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the report revived fears among investors that
the Federal Reserve will continue to boost interest rates until the
economy slows to a more sustainable pace. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 179.32 points to 10,945.50; the Nasdaq closed down
81.14 points to 3,630.09.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers are demanding more big-ticket items. ... We think
this should subsequently raise the level of manufacturing as a
whole in the coming months,'' said economist Richard Yamarone of
Argus Research Corp. ''This engine is not running out of gas
anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Orders for electronics and electrical equipment, including
semiconductors, circuit boards and home appliances, soared 9.7
percent, the eighth increase in the last 10 months and the biggest
jump since November. Such orders rose 9.3 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''This tells the story of the technology wave that is helping to
fuel economic growth,'' said Michael Niemira, an economist with the
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   Total durable-goods orders fell 1.9 percent in January and 2
percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those declines, durable-goods orders were up 7.4
percent in the first quarter of 2000 from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said March's durable-goods report provides a glimpse
of the strong growth that took place in the larger economy during
the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The surge in orders indicates the economy is still on fire,''
said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the government will release a report showing the
economy's growth during the first three months of this year. Many
analysts expect the economy grew at a 6 percent rate, well above
the Fed's preferred speed limit but not as brisk as the 7.3 percent
rate posted in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times since
June 30 to slow the speeding economy and to keep inflation under
control. Given the outlook for strong continuing growth, many
economists believe the Fed will bump up interest rates again on May
16.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Fed is looking for signs of moderation, they won't find
it here,'' First Union's chief economist David Orr said of
Wednesday's durable-goods report.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the booming economy has helped push the nation's
home ownership rate to an all-time high of 67.1 percent in the
first quarter of this year surpassing the previous record of 67
percent set in the third quarter of 1999, the Department of Housing
and Urban Development said in a report.
</P>
<P>
   Orders for transportation equipment grew by a solid 1.8 percent
in March as an increase in orders for cars and automobile parts
more than offset a decrease in shipbuilding and tanks.
Transportation orders fell by a sharp 9.7 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the volatile transportation category, total
durable-goods orders rose 2.8 percent in March, the largest
increase since July. Transportation is often volatile because it
includes such big purchases as airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Primary metals, the category that includes steel, saw orders go
up by 0.5 percent last month following a 1.6 percent decline in
February.
</P>
<P>
   But orders for industrial machinery, including computers and
machine tools fell 2.1 percent in March following a 3.8 percent
decline the month before. Those orders have been down four of the
last five months.
</P>
<P>
   Shipments of big-ticket items, a good sign of current demand,
rose 1.5 percent in March after a 1.4 percent drop the month
before.
</P>
<P>
   ''Strong investment by American companies will continue to
propel the economy forward in the second quarter of 2000,''
National Association of Manufacturers President Jerry Jasinowski
said.

<HEADLINE> Phillips To Cut 1,500 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA, Ohio (AP) -- A plant that makes television picture tubes
plans to lay off 1,500 workers beginning in 2001 and move most of
the work to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision will be made by the end of May, Phillips
Display Components spokesman Dave Thompson said Wednesday. He said
the company has a tentative agreement with a site in north central
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts would take place over a three-year period starting a
year from now, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Philips, the world's largest maker of picture tubes, is
transferring the work to Mexico to cut costs and because of
declining sales prices, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ottawa plant would remain open to make large picture tubes,
but most of its work would be moved to Mexico, Thompson said. He
would not say where the plant would be located.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 1,800 workers at the Philips plant in Ottawa, a
town of 4,000 people south of Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 employees would remain at the plant after the work is
transferred. The plant's four main manufacturing lines will be
moved one at a time, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The plant makes 4.2 million picture tubes each year for
television sets made by Philips and other manufacturers in the
United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also allows the company to move near more of its
customers, Thompson said. About 90 percent of the comapnies that
provide the plant's customer base have moved or are planning to
move to Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the plant were notified of the proposed layoffs
during shifts at the plant Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Philips delayed an announcement about the
job cuts. The company first said it planned to lay off between 120
and 160 workers in June.

<HEADLINE> Oneidas hope to ease fears of landowners legally  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ONEIDA, N.Y. (AP) -- With litigation looming to settle its
longstanding land claim, the Oneida Indian Nation on Wednesday
offered to legally protect private property owners if the case ends
up in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is essential that we do everything we can to make sure that
everyone knows that we will keep our word,'' Oneida Nation
representative Ray Halbritter said. ''On the eve of going back into
litigation, we want to make it clear to everyone that the
landowners will be protected. Rent or eviction is not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that, the Oneidas filed two documents earlier in the
day with U.S. District Court Judge Neal P. McCurn in Syracuse. One
document, a stipulation agreement, would remove the possibilities
of damages, rent or eviction.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe also asked McCurn to separate the proposed defendants
so the case against the state would proceed first. In effect, the
state would be agreeing to be sued, and the documents would make
sure that it couldn't wiggle out of the case later on.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people would like more of a binding, legal assurance,''
Halbritter said. ''That's why we're doing this. For us, our word is
enough. Our word is our bond. We believe it will relieve some
tension. That's as much as we can possibly do and retain our legal
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to make both documents legally binding, the state and
Madison and Oneida counties have to sign them, in effect agreeing
not to use the Oneidas' position against them in court at a later
time. The Oneidas of Wisconsin and Canada, who also are part of the
land claim, also have to sign the agreements, and Halbritter said
he would appeal to them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Halbritter said if the documents are signed, private landowners
would not be added as defendants initially. And he said if the
tribe is able to get full restitution from the state ''there would
be no need for further lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys had not yet heard from the Oneidas, Michael
McKeon, spokesman for Gov. George Pataki, said. McKeon questioned
how serious the overture was if the Oneidas were going through the
media first.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this means that the Oneidas are ready to return to the
negotiating table after walking away the last time, then they are
welcome back,'' he said. ''We haven't left. We've been sitting
there waiting for them to come back. This was a press conference.
We are going to wait to hear what they say at the negotiating table
and see if this is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks collapsed earlier this month after officials said the two
counties rejected a $45 million cash offer, and the state would not
back off from its demand for a 25 percent share of all ''new
gaming'' revenue at the tribe's Turning Stone Casino.
</P>
<P>
   The land claim stems from the state's purchase of 250,000 acres
in the two counties from the Oneidas in the late 18th and early
19th centuries. The Oneidas filed a lawsuit in 1974 over the
transactions. The U.S. Supreme Court found in 1985 that those
transactions were illegal and ruled that the Oneidas were entitled
to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in an attempt to bring more pressure on the state
to negotiate, the federal government sided with the Oneidas and
filed an amended complaint asking that 20,000 landowners in the two
counties be added as defendants. However, McCurn has not yet
decided whether to add the landowners as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Halbritter said the Oneidas were still willing to negotiate a
settlement, but he held out little hope for that. Both sides have
to inform McCurn of their intentions by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're obligated to carry on the land claim,'' Halbritter said
as he stood in a meeting room at the tribe's new Children and
Elders Center. ''It's about our future generations. Our elders got
us here. Our children will carry us to the future.''

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Earnings Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch Cos.'s profit rose 9.7 percent
in the first quarter as the brewer inched closer to capturing half
the beer market in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat Wall Street expectations. Its stock fell in
afternoon trading but recovered to finish at $74.56 1/4, up 18 3/4
cents, at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of the best-selling Budweiser and the top light beer,
Bud Light, earned $350 million, or 76 cents per share, in the three
months ended March 31, up from earnings of $319 million, or 66
cents per share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected
earnings of 74 cents a share in the latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose to $3.30 billion from $3.16 billion. The company's
domestic market share rose 0.8 percentage point to 49 percent in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Budweiser and Bud light from wholesalers to retailers
rose 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic beer shipments increased 0.6 million barrels to 23.7
million barrels. The company said the increased shipments reflected
the continued strength of Budweiser products, particularly Bud
Light, which continued to grow at a double-digit pace.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Anheuser-Busch rolled out Tequiza Extra, an extension
of the tequila-and-lime flavored Tequiza brand introduced a year
earlier. And in May, the company plans to introduce its Doc Otis
lemon-flavored malt beverage, aimed at consumers of imports and
specialty alcoholic drinks.

<HEADLINE> Sara Lee Posts 7 Pct. Profit Hike  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Sara Lee Corp.'s profit rose 7 percent in its
third quarter, overcoming the continuing swoon in its food
operations with strong sales of such items as underwear and
insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   But a 48 percent drop in profits at its Sara Lee Foods unit
unsettled investors. The company's shares fell more than 5 percent,
or 87{ cents, to $15.56\ on Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Falling bakery sales worldwide and lingering fallout from the
December 1998 recall that crippled the world leader in packaged
meats were blamed for the food unit's decline, along with sharply
higher hog costs that ate into meat profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most parts of its business are doing very well, but Sara Lee's
clearly not operating on all cylinders,'' said Robert Cummins, an
analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co. Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings for its third quarter, ended March 31, were $262
million, or 29 cents a share, up from $245 million, or 26 cents a
share, in the year-earlier period. Wall Street analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial had forecast earnings of 29 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the quarter rose 5 percent to $4.88 billion, from
$4.66 billion in the first three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months, Sara Lee earned $909 million, or 99
cents a share, up from $905 million, or 95 cents a share, a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-month revenue was $15.16 billion, up 2 percent from $14.81
billion.
</P>
<P>
   John Bryan, the longtime chief executive officer who's leaving
the post in July, said higher sales and profits in the branded
apparel, foodservice and household and body care units generated
''superior'' cash flow and enabled the company to buy back 20
million shares during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the recently completed acquisition of Chock Full
O'Nuts and Nestle's North American coffee operations had greatly
enhanced Sara Lee's coffee business.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while the company's overall results were as
expected, the problem with packaged meats led to a weaker quarter
for Sara Lee Foods than had been foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've now lapped some of the problems of a year ago and
they're still struggling,'' said John McMillin of Prudential
Securities. ''Part of it's higher hog costs. But they're not out of
the woods yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee is a global consumer packaged goods company whose
leading brands include Sara Lee, Douwe Egberts, Hillshire Farms,
Hanes, Coach and Playtex.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein's Doherty upbeat on prospects for peace in NorthernIreland  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Sinn Fein vice president Pat Doherty told
Irish Americans in and around New Jersey's state capitol Wednesday
he is confident that the peace process in Northern Ireland can
survive recent setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the process ''solid,'' Doherty said, ''It is not the
text (of the accords), it is the good will that has been lacking
... There will be problems, but fundamentally there will be no
turning back.''
</P>
<P>
   British authorities in February suspended the elected Assembly
and its ruling cabinet, claiming the IRA's refusal to disarm had
placed the provincial government in danger of permanent collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty is one of the 108 elected members of the Assembly, and
his Sinn Fein party has been linked to the IRA and often speaks for
it. He said suspending the government was an irrational move
because armed militants will agree to disarm only if elected
government institutions are in place and are shown to be stable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not resolve it unless there is a political context,
and a political way to move forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty said continuous support from millions of Irish-American
Catholics has kept international attention on the crisis, which in
turn limits the danger that secretive political maneuvers in
Belfast will scuttle the 1998 Good Friday accords.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly the White House has never disengaged from the
process,'' Doherty said. ''I think it is primarily due to Irish
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty has played a prominent role in disarmament talks and was
more upbeat in his New Jersey tour than Sinn Fein president Gerry
Adams has been on the prospects of salvaging the fledgling
government.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty met with Irish-American political and business leaders
at the Statehouse, and was scheduled later to visit popular Irish
clubs and bars in neighboring Hamilton Township, where collections
are frequently taken to help the families of dead or imprisoned IRA
men.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters if he ever feels his own life is at risk,
Doherty said, ''If I woke up every morning worried about who was
going to shoot me, I would never get out of bed.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Statehouse news conference Doherty said he was pleased to
find so many Irish surnames in the New Jersey political
establishment, including Woodbridge Mayor James McGreevey, a likely
Democratic candidate for governor next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have said constantly peace without justice is not peace,''
said McGreevey, who as a state legislator sponsored trade
resolutions intended to help economic development in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty was also joined by U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith,
R-Robbinsville, chairman of the House Human Rights subcommittee
that has staged visits and hearings in Northern Ireland on civil
rights abuses, most recently the harassment and killing of Catholic
criminal defense attorneys.

   WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson confronted a
group of white supremacists in Wallingford Wednesday, after
applauding lawmakers and the governor for passing a law that would
force the town to close its offices on Martin Luther King Day.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was in Wallingford for a rally in support of the
legislation will require all 169 municipalities in Connecticut to
recognize the holiday. Wallingford is currently the only town in
Connecticut that keeps its offices open on King Day.
</P>
<P>
   A group of about 10 people waving Confederate flags showed up to
protest Jackson's visit. Jackson offered to shake the hand of one
man who was dressed in Ku Klux Klan garb, but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for sheets to be worn on a bed and not to hide a
person's face,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation occurred minutes before Jackson was to attend
a church service and lead a march to town hall.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate gave final legislative approval to the King Day
bill minutes before midnight Tuesday, and Gov. John G. Rowland
signed it Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad this governor signed this bill today to make a
statement for the country and for the world,'' the civil rights
leader said between privately meeting with Rowland and addressing
the state House of Representatives in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Wallingford Mayor William Dickinson has ''slept
through a revolution'' while leading the only town in the state
which has not closed its municipal offices on King Day, despite a
1986 law making it a state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may be looking at a Rip Van Winkle situation where some
people sleep too long,'' Jackson said. ''And while they're asleep,
the world passes them by.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was expected to meet with Dickinson Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson has said the controversy is not about race, but a
dispute with the town's labor unions. Dickinson wants town workers
to swap another holiday for King Day, but union leaders want
workers to get the day off as an extra paid holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Jan. 17 holiday this year, three people wearing Ku
Klux Klan hoods and robes walked along Main Street in Wallingford.
On the holiday, one of those people stood near a church where a
celebration honoring King was being held. Neo-Nazi literature also
has been distributed around the town.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to make bigots feel uncomfortable in
Wallingford and everywhere else,'' said Rep. Mary Mushinsky,
D-Wallingford. ''And its' important that my hometown Wallingford
reiterates that we are a town that thrives on diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a national report released this week that says
minority youths are treated less fairly than their white peers by
the judicial system, Jackson called for a change in the way young
black and Latino offenders are dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   He said improved education in communities and prisons will
reduce criminal recidivism rates among juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now they leave jail sicker and slicker and return to jail
quicker,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also was expected to join a rally with striking workers
at the Avery Heights nursing home in Hartford Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Victims' Rights Bill Faces Battle  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A victims' rights amendment to the
Constitution being debated in the Senate doesn't have the votes
necessary for passage, its Republican sponsor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now it's an uphill battle to get 67 votes,'' said Sen.
Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. ''It may be a bridge too far.''
</P>
<P>
   A vote is likely Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday started debating the amendment that would
enshrine in the Constitution rights for victims of violent crime or
their families. Those rights would include reasonable notice of
court proceedings and an offender's release or escape, the right to
attend and be heard at legal proceedings and court-ordered
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate are needed for
passage. The amendment would also need to be ratified by
three-fourths of state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The House has yet to take up the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have said they support the concept but believe the
same guarantees can be written into law without tinkering with the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must say I am very concerned about the cavalier attitude
which I have observed with respect to the offering of
constitutional amendments,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.V., in a
speech that lasted nearly three hours. ''There is a cavalier spirit
which seems to say that if it sounds good politically, if it looks
good politically, if it will get votes, let's introduce an
amendment to the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, however, said the amendment is needed to balance
constitutional protections that suspects and criminals receive.
Thirty-two states have enacted some form of victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've given statutes plenty of opportunity,'' Kyl
said. ''They haven't gotten the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and one of the sponsors of the
amendment, agreed. ''The reason the statute won't work is because
it hasn't worked,'' she told senators at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein and Kyl spent much of Wednesday negotiating for the
measure even as support began to wane. Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, asked to be removed as one of 42 cosponsors, Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   The two also offered to make several changes to the measure to
garner the support of President Clinton, Kyl said. Clinton, while
having no constitutional role in amending the Constitution, has
said he supports a victims' rights amendment but has reservations
about the current proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hoped gaining his support would sway other Democrats
but ''it doesn't appear to me even if we write it the way they want
to write it they're going to become strong advocates,'' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials released a letter sent Tuesday to
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, saying, ''Although we continue
to strongly support a victims' rights amendment to the Constitution
... we oppose the amendment in its current form.''

<HEADLINE> Red Wings, Avalanche Resume Rivalry  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- They're healthy, they're rested and they're
playing their best hockey. What better way for the NHL's fiercest
rivals, the Detroit Red Wings and Colorado Avalanche, to kick off
their second-round playoff series?
</P>
<P>
   Some hockey observers have suggested that the Red
Wings-Avalanche showdown, which begins here Thursday night, is, in
effect, the real Stanley Cup Final, since it matches two of the
teams most often touted as favorites to win the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado coach Bob Hartley tended to agree with that assessment.
While insisting there are ''still tons of good hockey clubs
remaining,'' Hartley hinted it is unfair for such contenders to be
meeting so early in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We faced the Red Wings last year in Round 2 also,'' Hartley
said Wednesday. ''That's the way the schedule is. There's no sense
fighting the system. We're part of the same conference, and that's
the way it's built.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is life in the Western Conference, which clearly is the
strength of the NHL this season.
</P>
<P>
   Each team is at the top of its game. Detroit comes to Colorado
after sweeping its opening-round series with the Los Angeles Kings,
finishing off that series last Wednesday. Colorado is 12-1-0 in its
last 13 games, having eliminated Phoenix 4-1 in a series that ended
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams enter the series with no significant injuries, and
Colorado's Peter Forsberg has strung together two dominating games
after struggling with shoulder and other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, both teams insist they must raise their level of play
in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time right now to raise our game a notch,'' Avalanche
goaltender Patrick Roy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to play better in the next series to advance,'' Red
Wings center Steve Yzerman said. ''Everything tightens up,
everything picks up another step.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Brendan Shanahan agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the playoffs go on, you've got to improve,'' Shanahan said
''The intensity and the pressure of the games increase and your
competition gets better and more desperate. Each year we won the
Cup, we got better as each round went on.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Larry Murphy sounded a word of warning.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you took away all our power-play goals and empty-net goals,
it (Kings series) would be a pretty tight series,'' Murphy said.
''We got through it and that's what's important, but I think
everybody is a little disappointed with how things went.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to go through another series where it all
depends on the specialty teams, and I think that's why we're a
little concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first round, Detroit ranked second in the NHL in
power-play production, scoring seven goals in 23 opportunities, or
30.4 percent. Colorado was third at 25.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned against Phoenix and the Red Wings learned against
the Kings that the power play can be a big factor,'' Hartley said.
''They were great on power plays, and so were we.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be a hard-fought series. You're going to see
a lot of body checks, but I don't think you're going to see any
undisciplined play.''
</P>
<P>
   The blood-letting that was commonplace in this series in 1996
and 1997 has subsided, leading to a more civilized brand of hockey.
But bad blood remains.
</P>
<P>
   ''These teams don't like each other,'' Avalanche captain Joe
Sakic said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Hartley, ''There won't be any friendly games out there.
We're going to go to war, and they're going to go to war. We're
going to have to fight for each inch of ice out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado beat the Wings in last year's playoffs, rallying from a
2-0 deficit to win four straight games before losing in the next
round to eventual champion Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit had the advantage during the regular season this year,
beating Colorado four times in five meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ''That doesn't matter at all,'' Avs defenseman Aaron Miller
said. ''San Jose beat St. Louis (in the playoffs), and they didn't
beat them all year. No one really cares about the regular season
anyway. We're just worried about winning four games now.''
</P>
<P>
   A difference in this year's Colorado team is the leadership of
veteran defenseman Ray Bourque, acquired in a trade with Boston on
March 6. That addition hasn't gone unnoticed by the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ''He adds a lot to their club,'' Detroit defenseman Nicklas
Lidstrom said. ''On the power play, he's got a great shot. He logs
a lot of minutes for them, too. He's really helped that team.''

<HEADLINE> Judge rejects Tiger Lady's appeal to keep exotic animal permit  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A judge Wednesday upheld a plan to shut
down a private tiger preserve in Jackson Township by denying an
appeal brought by the owner of the Tigers Only Preservation
Society.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative Law Judge John R. Tassini agreed with the state
Department of Environmental Protection, which revoked the owner's
exotic animal permit after a Bengal tiger was found wandering about
two miles from her property last year.
</P>
<P>
   The DEP must now give Joan Byron-Marasek ''a reasonable period
of time for removal of the tigers to an appropriate, lawfully
operated facility,'' Tassini wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a win not just for Jackson and the neighbors who have
had to suffer, but it's also a win for the animals,'' said township
Mayor Geoffrey Yalden.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials and residents close to Byron-Marasek's property
have complained of noise, odors, dust and other problems from the
nearly two dozen tigers kept there, Yalden said. In addition to the
tigers, Byron-Marasek keeps approximately 30 guard dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can only imagine what it would be like to be a dog locked up
with a hungry, 300-pound Siberian tiger,'' Yalden said. ''No wonder
the dogs howled at night.''
</P>
<P>
   The permit allowed Byron-Marasek to keep the animals for
theatrical or educational purposes. The judge said she offered no
proof that the animals have ever been used in any production.
</P>
<P>
   ''She didn't do any of that. She keeps them as huge pets,'' said
DEP spokesman Peter Page.
</P>
<P>
   Byron-Marasek also claimed to use the tigers for breeding. But
Tassini said she routinely misidentified the tiger breeds and their
characteristics, even noting the Siberian tiger's ''gentle
disposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the exact number of tigers on the property unclear,
Byron-Marasek did not keep records on births, deaths or general
health of the animals, the judge said. She also failed to note how
much and how often the tigers ate, he said. A state worker
routinely dropped off dead deer collected from roads as food, the
judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The tigers -- some who weighed up to 400 pounds -- were kept in
chainlink compounds with no access to recreation areas or water,
the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The applicant's arrangement of cages, runs, chutes and
trailers provides little opportunity for normal tiger behavior,
except for fighting and procreation,'' Tassini wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators claimed they found no evidence that the tigers
were getting a continuous source of food, and it appeared the
animals on the site had been ''involved in fights, been injured and
not received the necessary veterinary care,'' according to a
Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife letter denying the annual
permit.
</P>
<P>
   Byron-Marasek continued to keep at least 26 tigers on her
property while she appealed the permit denial. The U.S. Department
of Agriculture earlier this year renewed her federal license to run
the tiger preserve.
</P>
<P>
   According to one report, state investigators found rotting deer
carcasses, rat infestation and cramped facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Byron-Marasek's attorney, Valter Must, did not return three
telephone messages left by The Associated Press on Wednesday
afternoon. Neither Byron-Marasek nor the tiger preserve has a
listed telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Must has 13 days to submit a written challenge to the judge's
findings. The DEP has 45 days to review the decision for any
possible appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Now the DEP will begin looking for a suitable home for the
animals, Page said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to take a search to see where you can relocate
20-some tigers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rivers Honored As NBA Coach of Year  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- All things considered, Doc Rivers would
rather have been somewhere else Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs began without his Orlando Magic last weekend, and
winning the Red Auerbach Trophy as the NBA's coach of the year
didn't soothe the pain of being eliminated from contention in the
next-to-last game of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell you, I would have loved to have been in Indiana
receiving this award,'' said Rivers, whose team finished a
surprising 41-41 but finished a game behind Milwaukee in its bid
for the eighth position in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks meet the Pacers in Game 2 of their best-of-five,
first-round series Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having said that, getting it is still nice ... If you look at
our organization, we're absolutely headed in the right direction.
As tough as that loss to the Bucks was for me and the players, it
makes you want it more now. It makes you put a value on what it
takes to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Magic finished with a .500 record despite launching a
massive rebuilding project that began with the trading of four of
five starters from last year's team, including All-Star Penny
Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Starting four players -- Darrell Armstrong, John Amaechi, Bo
Outlaw and Ben Wallace -- who were not drafted by any NBA team,
Rivers kept the Magic in contention until the final week with a
hustling, up-tempo style that relied on defensive pressure to
create scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers, who played 13 seasons for the Hawks, Clippers, Knicks
and Spurs before retiring in 1996 to become a television analyst
for Turner Sports, is the first coach in league history to win the
award without leading his team to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He's the third to receive it with a team that posted a record of
.500 or below, and the fifth to be recognized after his first
season, joining Harry Gallatin (1962-63), Johnny Kerr (1966-67),
Mike Schuler (1986-87) and Larry Bird (1997-98) .
</P>
<P>
   ''It's gratifying because of the fact that people undervalued
our players. I didn't mind them undervaluing me because I hadn't
coached. But I did mind them undervaluing my players,'' Rivers
said. ''I had felt from day one that we had better players than
what everyone thought we did. And I think by the end of the season,
that proved to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers received 60 votes from a 121-member panel to win by seven
votes over Phil Jackson, who led the Los Angeles Lakers to the
league's top record. They were followed in the balloting by
Charlotte's Paul Silas (3), Utah's Jerry Sloan (2) and Miami's Pat
Riley, Phoenix's Scott Skiles and Toronto's Butch Carter (1 each).
</P>
<P>
   ''I personally voted for Jerry Sloan with the Sporting News,
he's never won the award,'' Jackson said. ''He's a guy who's teams
have been at the top for the last decade. That he would get (only)
two votes is absolutely ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers said last week that he thought Jackson deserved the honor
because teams are judged by the number of games they win, and
coaches should be, too. He changed his tune Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was being diplomatic,'' he said, breaking into laughter.
''To be honored next to names like Red Auerbach, Phil Jackson and
Lenny Wilkens is a tremendous honor. I was joking today that the
only time I had heard a Phil Jackson comparison to was that: 'Boy,
he's no Phil Jackson.' To be honored with him is real nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers replaced Hall of Famer Chuck Daly, who retired last May,
and inherited a team that shared the best record in the Eastern
Conference during the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Magic also were beaten in the first round of the
playoffs by the younger, more athletic Philadelphia 76ers and
management faced a critical decision on whether to try to keep
Hardaway from fleeing as a free agent or rebuild without a marquee
star.
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Gabriel opted for the latter. And by
season's end, the Magic made 37 player transactions involving 38
different players and cleared about $18 million under the salary
cap to try to lure one or two big-name free agents to town this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Orlando has accumulated nine first-round draft
picks over the next five years, including three lottery picks in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ''You think about what's happened here and it's amazing,''
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are still going to say we overachieved. But we didn't.
Overachieving is when a high school team beat a pro team or
something like that. We felt like we had talent as good as any
team, and Doc was part of that. We worked hard. That's how you win
games. That's why it's not overachieving.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Accepts Debate Offers  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELDON, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday called
for tax changes to help keep family farms in the family and
accepted two offers to debate her Senate rival, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped at a more than 100-year-old dairy farm and
called for increasing the estate tax exemption for family
businesses to $1.75 million. It now is $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ought to be able to leave your land and the bulk of your
fortunes to your children and not to the government,'' she told
more than 100 people at the farm 35 miles east of Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Clinton said she had accepted invitations for
two televised debates with Giuliani in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the first lady did not commit to a third proposed debate.
Clinton and Giuliani have been invited by New York's Independence
Party to a forum Saturday in Buffalo. Giuliani has accepted while
Clinton said Wednesday she was still ''working it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party -- the New York wing of the Reform Party --
is in the midst of a court battle over its leadership. One faction
supports conservative Pat Buchanan and the other adamantly opposes
his presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   New York allows major party candidates to count votes received
on other parties' ballot lines, which can make the difference in
close races.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton said Wednesday that she was concerned that
pursuing the ballot line of the Independence Party could put her on
a ticket led by Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a very big difference with him on nearly every issue
you can imagine,'' Clinton told reporters after a speech to
Democrats in Salamanca, where she stopped on her way to Buffalo for
a televised town hall forum.
</P>
<P>
   Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman for Giuliani's campaign,
said the mayor has made it clear he wants additional debates.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was in Manhattan, where he called a reporter a ''jerk''
outside City Hall as a group of English schoolchildren looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had been chatting with the children about New York's
tourist attractions when the reporter interrupted and asked whether
new City Hall security measures were similar to any the children
had seen in London.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just don't pay any attention to him,'' Giuliani told the
children, who were about 11 years old. ''We have embarrassments in
America. He's one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the children seemed confused by the exchange; none of
them said anything.
</P>
<P>
   The object of Giuliani's ire, Rafael Martinez Alequin, publishes
The Free Press, a tabloid that is highly critical of the Giuliani
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The city installed airport-style metal detectors at City Hall on
Tuesday. The move was in response to a federal judge's order that
the city provide greater public access to the area.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 14, Rangers 4  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra had three hits,
including a home run, to extend his hitting streak to 13 games as
the Boston Red Sox routed the Texas Rangers 14-4 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's RBI double provided Boston's first run, and was
part of a five-run first-inning outburst after Texas starter Mark
Clark (2-2) got the first two outs. Garciaparra was among seven
straight Red Sox hitters to reach with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom seven hitters in the batting order, responsible for
Boston's best first inning of the season, had at least two hits.
The 21 hits were a season high for Boston and the most allowed by
Texas this season.
</P>
<P>
   With his second 3-for-5 game in the series, plus an intentional
walk with Boston leading by six runs, Garciaparra was 8-for-14 in
the three games against Texas. He is 25-for-48 (.521) against the
Rangers since the start of last season.
</P>
<P>
   During his hitting streak this season, Garciaparra is 25-of-54
(.463). He raised his average 17 points to .386 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After Clark got the first two Boston batters out, Brian Daubach
and Garciaparra hit consecutive doubles. Following a walk, Carl
Everett hit a three-run homer and No. 9 hitter Wilton Veras later
added an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach had four hits, including a career-high three doubles.
Everett's third hit was an RBI double as the Red Sox added four
more runs in the ninth off Tim Crabtree, the sixth Texas pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Clark left after giving up a one-out RBI single to Troy O'Leary
in the second. He gave up six runs on seven hits in the shortest
outing by a Rangers starter this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored in each of the first four innings to build a
9-0 lead. Jason Varitek hit the first pitch of the third, and
Garciaparra hit his second homer of the season an inning later when
another run also scored on a Texas error.
</P>
<P>
   Boston starter Jeff Fassero (2-1) was the benefactor and didn't
allow a run until David Segui doubled and scored on a fielder's
choice grounder in the fourth for Texas. Ivan Rodriguez hit a
two-run homer, his seventh, in the fifth. Tom Evans had an RBI
single in the ninth for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero was pulled after Segui led off the sixth with a sharp
single to left. Fassero allowed three runs on seven hits, three of
them by Segui, with two strikeouts and two walks.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Before Clark's early departure, Texas pitchers had 17
straight starts in which they went at least five innings. That was
the longest streak for the Rangers since 1984 when the starters
went five-plus innings in 36 straight games. ... Both teams are off
Thursday, Texas before a three-game series at Baltimore and the Red
Sox prior to playing three games at Cleveland. ... Segui had three
hits for his eighth multi-hit game in his last 12 and 12th overall,
second in the majors.

<HEADLINE> Bush Faces Criticism at Home  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE MABIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush should ask the state
health commissioner to resign over his comments about teen
pregnancy and Hispanics, civil rights groups said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus also asked for
Dr. Reyn Archer to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Archer has been under fire since telling The New York Times
earlier this month that Hispanics are culturally resistant to the
idea that ''getting pregnant is a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He has apologized, in writing and in person to state
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas Freedom Network, League of United Latin American
Citizens, Mexican-American Legal Defense &AMP; Educational Fund and
Rainbow Coalition said apologies weren't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're putting Governor Bush on notice: as his appointee to the
post of commissioner of health, Archer's comments only fuel
questions about Governor Bush's tolerance of racism and sexism,''
said Samantha Smoot, director of the Texas Freedom Network.
</P>
<P>
   Archer ''has no plans to resign,'' said his spokesman, Doug
McBride.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Mike Jones said the governor is satisfied with
Archer's apology and wouldn't seek his resignation. ''Governor Bush
does not tolerate racism in any form,'' Jones added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was criticized Wednesday by a group of Republican
women from the Houston suburb of Clear Lake, who oppose a new state
emissions permit for a chemical plant in nearby Bayport.
</P>
<P>
   The women said the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission, the state's environmental agency, continues to grant
permits to polluting plants despite deteriorating air quality.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Jones defended the governor's record, saying
Texas has reduced toxic emissions more than all other states
combined.

<HEADLINE> Karl Still Teaching Bucks  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- George Karl has coined a phrase to
describe his Milwaukee Bucks, who sometimes play to their potential
and sometimes look as if they've never been coached before.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're my sometimes team,'' the Bucks coach said.
</P>
<P>
   After 83 games and seven months of daily contact, Karl said he
still doesn't know a lot about the Bucks, who face the Indiana
Pacers on Thursday night in the second game of their first-round
series.
</P>
<P>
   Though his team has taxed his patience and his own faith in his
abilities, Karl calls this season one of his most constructive as a
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not saying this has been my best year, but I got to do a
lot more coaching than I did in the last while,'' Karl said.
''That's something you enjoy when you haven't been doing it for a
while. It's been a return to my roots, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was fired by Seattle in 1998, the SuperSonics were a
finely tuned machine. They won 55 games or more in six straight
seasons, but a lack of playoff success and a fight with team
management doomed him.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two years in Milwaukee, he has thrilled fans and
owner Herb Kohl by taking the Bucks to the playoffs twice. The
once-proud franchise endured seven years out of the postseason
during the coaching tenures of Mike Dunleavy and Chris Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Karl still insists the team has exceeded his own expectations
despite a roster with two All-Stars and a wealth of offensive
talent. While he knows expectations for next season will be higher,
he has already declared the current one a success.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all proud of what we've done this year, but we need to
win in the playoffs to make it all worth it,'' Glenn Robinson said.
''Coach has got us to this point, and we hope we can pay him back
by taking it further.''
</P>
<P>
   As a defense-minded coach, Karl is in an unusual situation with
the offensively talented Bucks. The team's stars are all standout
jump-shooters and mediocre defenders, and their talents are
particularly unsuited to play Karl's brand of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it took the Bucks until the season's final 15 games to
begin to grasp the defensive scheme Karl and assistant Terry Stotts
employed to great effect in Seattle. The system, which depends
heavily on double-teaming and intelligent decisions on switches,
helped make a defensive star of Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger Bucks spent almost the entire season befuddled
by the system. Even earlier this week, Karl stopped a practice
scrimmage to chastise Ray Allen for missing a switch, saying,
''You've been messing that up all season long, Ray!''
</P>
<P>
   But with 15 games left in the season and the Bucks three games
out of a playoff spot, things suddenly kicked into gear. Milwaukee
went 11-4 to close the season and streaked past Orlando for the
East's final playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee held its opponents to 96.1 points per game -- a number
that would have been much lower without two high-scoring overtime
games -- and gave a greatly increased effort on defense. Some Bucks
say it was because they finally figured out Karl's defense, though
Karl isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think our system isn't as complicated as it's made out
to be,'' he said. ''Defense is about your heart more than your
talent. I don't know if we've always displayed that heart this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl thinks the Bucks finally started to play defense because
they realized a trip to the playoffs hinged on it. He doesn't know
why he was unable to motivate them to do it earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like I said, they're the sometimes team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Bucks are in the playoffs, the languorous schedule
has Karl struggled to keep his team focused during three straight
off-days. He thinks the extra time off is beneficial to aging,
playoff-tested teams like the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather play a best-of-11,'' he said with a grin. ''Just
get out on the court and go. That would be the best thing for my
team.''

<HEADLINE> Defending Decathlon Champ Trailing  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Kip Janvrin had only himself to blame
for where he stood after the first day of the Drake Relays
decathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Kamau Sullivan, who trained under Janvrin for two years in
Warrensburg, Mo., took the lead Wednesday with a career-best 4,006
points. Jeff Sander, who trains under Janvrin now, was second with
3,909.
</P>
<P>
   Janvrin, seeking his sixth consecutive Drake title and 11th
overall, was third with 3,878.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the leaders is to hold on because Janvrin's
second-day events are his best. Last year, he trailed Sullivan by
nine points after the first day and ended up beating him by 556.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm up and coming and he's already there at a high level,''
said Sullivan, who now lives in Indianapolis. ''When we intersect
at that high level, it's going to be a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   And when might that be?
</P>
<P>
   ''That's supposed to happen tomorrow,'' Sullivan said with a
grin.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State's Barbara Szlendakova led the heptathlon with 3,216
points. Wichita State's Mellanee Welty, the winner the last two
years, was second with 3,190.
</P>
<P>
   Decathletes compete in the 100 meters, long jump, shot put, high
jump and 400 the first day. They finish with the 110 hurdles,
discus, pole vault, javelin and 1,500. Janvrin is especially strong
in those last four.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need to do a good job in the hurdles. That's one of my best
events,'' Sullivan said. ''Then I just have to relax and remember
what he taught me and do some of that on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Janvrin, 34, said he was in a good spot despite being 128 points
off the lead. He has faced even greater deficits at Drake and still
won.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guys ahead of me are guys I've worked with. I know what
they can do,'' he said. ''I just need to be within eyesight of them
in the 1,500 and I'll be OK. Nobody can beat me in the 1,500.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan won the high jump Wednesday and finished third in the
100, shot put and long jump. Janvrin finished first in the 100 and
400 but lost 256 points to Sullivan in the high jump and long jump.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Iowa's Travis Geopfert won the shot put and
Washington's Jacob Predmore won the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   Janvrin said a groin injury has hampered his training in the
hurdles. He also said Sullivan and Sander have improved in the
throwing events and will be tough to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not afraid to lose. I'm not afraid to pass the torch to
somebody younger,'' Janvrin said. ''At the same time, I'm not going
to make it easy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Szlendakova seemed shocked to be leading the heptathlon. She
missed the outdoor season last year because of a stress fracture
and had not done a heptathlon since the NCAA championships in June
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I happy to be ahead, but it's still the first day and it
doesn't mean anything,'' Szlendakova said. ''I really need to get a
good long jump tomorrow and then see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Szlendakova did not take the lead until winning the 200, the
final event of the day. She was third in the 100 hurdles but was
disappointed with her throw of 33 feet, 4 inches in the shot put,
which placed her seventh among the 11 competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just not very good at throws,'' said Szlendakova, a slim
sophomore from the Czech Republic. ''It's all technique. I'm
throwing well in practice, but I come to the competition and can't
convert it.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty won the high jump, Alcorn State's Millicent Sylvan won the
hurdles and McKendree's Neisha Thompson finished first in the shot.
Sylvan was third overall with 3,153 points.

<HEADLINE> Lions Re-Sign Three Free Agents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions re-signed unrestricted
free-agent safeties Corwin Brown and Ryan Stewart and linebacker
Scott Kowalkowski on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Contract terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Brown played in 13 games for Detroit last season, his first with
the Lions and seventh in the NFL. He tied for third on the team
with 15 special teams tackles and had an interception in the Lions'
loss to Washington in the NFC wild-card playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Kowalkowski started three games in 1999, his ninth NFL season
and sixth with Detroit, and had 36 tackles and an interception. He
also had 15 special teams tackles, giving him 85 during his six
seasons in Detroit -- more than any other Lions player during that
span.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart missed most of the 1999 season, his fourth with the
Lions, because of a groin injury that forced him onto the injured
reserve list Oct. 30. He had three tackles, including two on
special teams, and a sack.

<HEADLINE> NBC Seeks Elian Coverage Explanation  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC asked the federal government on Wednesday to
explain why a cameraman who tried to cover last weekend's raid to
seize Elian Gonzalez was prevented from taking pictures.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's cameraman, Tony Zumbado, was pushed to the floor during
the raid and no video was recorded inside the house of Elian's
Miami relatives. A photographer from The Associated Press recorded
several still pictures, including an image of a federal agent with
a gun pointed in the direction of the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wheatley, vice president of NBC News, said he doesn't know
whether agents were trying to avoid having pictures taken or were
simply trying to secure the area. Either way, the results were the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fair to say that our people weren't able to do their work
because of the action of agents,'' Wheatley said.
</P>
<P>
   He's asked for an explanation by Immigration and Naturalization
Service Commissioner Doris Meissner. A spokeswoman for Meissner did
not immediately return a telephone call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported this week that Attorney General
Janet Reno, seeking to avoid allegations of a government coverup,
decided not to prevent photographers from taking pictures of Elian
as he was seized last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Zumbado and his sound man, Gustavo Moeller, were working as part
of a pool arrangement to take pictures for several networks, at the
invitation of the Miami relatives. They and Alan Diaz, a free-lance
photographer working for the AP, were waiting in the yard next to
their home when the raid began.
</P>
<P>
   All three men jumped a fence to rush toward the home. Diaz got
there first, and was directed to the room where Elian was being
held.
</P>
<P>
   Zumbado and Moeller arrived at the front door at the same time
as several INS agents, Wheatley said.
</P>
<P>
   Moeller was ordered away from the house at gunpoint, Wheatley
said. He was told to get on the ground and was struck in the head
by an agent's gun barrel, causing a cut, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zumbado had made it in the house and was trying to disconnect
cables that tied his camera to Moeller. He was knocked to the floor
and knocked off balance again when he tried to get up. While
kneeling, he was told not to get up or he would be shot, Wheatley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very clear that he was not in a position to take
pictures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley said the network understands the risk to its personnel
covering such an action.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not naive,'' he said, ''and we're aware that they needed
to secure the area. But based on the description we have, we
believe that the agents went further than they had to and prevented
him from taking pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley said he had not received a response from Meissner.

<HEADLINE> Legal actions keep high court busy, shovels still  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) The motions are filed, the sound bites
recorded, the political positions staked.
</P>
<P>
   But the shovels are still.
</P>
<P>
   And many children -- rich and poor, from Cape May to High Point --
attend schools with overcrowded classrooms, outdated wiring and
leaky roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman has promised a school construction program
for all districts -- rich and poor, south and north -- as she tries
to remedy years of neglect that have left behind crumbling and
overcrowded schools.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the need for school repairs and building. But
the question is: How much should the state pay?
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins is asking the state Supreme Court
to answer that question.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the high court's 1998 decision allows the state to
force even the poorest districts to ante up a share of an estimated
$6 billion in construction costs.
</P>
<P>
   He has asked the Supreme Court to clarify that ruling, which
directed the state to launch an enormous school construction
program in the 30 special needs districts.
</P>
<P>
   But both the Education Law Center, which represents poor
children, and the state -- usually at odds with each other -- agree
that the ruling is clear.
</P>
<P>
   In briefs filed this week, both urged the high court to reject
Collins' request.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for poor children and some Democratic lawmakers say
Collins' maneuver is further delaying the long overdue and sorely
needed program.
</P>
<P>
   ''The children have been waiting for years now for their
crumbling, overcrowded and obsolete school buildings to be
replaced,'' said David Sciarra, director of the Education Law
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''The speaker has brought us back to court at the very time when
shovels should be in the ground,'' he said. ''For that reason, the
court should immediately reaffirm compliance'' with the order.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the legalities won't further delay the program.
Legislation will be in place by the end of June, he promised last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But he still questions how the court can force lawmakers to
fully fund school construction without ever including them in the
case that ordered it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we aren't a party to the case, why are we bound by the
case?'' Collins wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Sciarra, though, says the law and the court decisions are clear.
</P>
<P>
   The state can't force property-poor towns to raise taxes to
finance school construction. That means the state has to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Sciarra also wonders why Collins is raising the issue now --
nearly two years after the court ordered the construction program.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes down to money, said Don Sico, executive director of
the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   When the court issued its decision in May 1998, the estimated
cost of repairs and new construction in the 30 ''special needs''
districts was about $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, Sico said, has to question whether the state should be
forced to pay that much, especially when many other districts are
begging for construction funds.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and lawmakers have promised to help all districts
finance their school construction costs, which have mounted as
tax-weary voters routinely reject building referendums, even in
growing, suburban towns.
</P>
<P>
   The entire cost in these other nearly 600 districts is loosely
estimated to be about $6 billion, said David Rosen, a budget expert
in the state Office of Legislative Services.
</P>
<P>
   The state would pay about one-third of that, under proposed
legislation, Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the total annual cost to the state could eventually
climb to a daunting $770 million, Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, lawmakers have earmarked only about $220 million from
lottery proceeds, the cigarette tax and the national tobacco
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   That promises to eventually put a lot of pressure on lawmakers
to come up with either a new tax, to cut spending or to skimp on
construction funds for New Jersey's other districts.
</P>
<P>
   If the speaker can successfully challenge the court's ruling,
the state stands to save millions.
</P>
<P>
   But while that challenge takes place, millions of children
master math in trailers and attend schools that lack libraries. For
them, answers to these questions can't come soon enough.

<HEADLINE> Court Deliberates Pinochet Case  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Amid clashes between foes and followers
of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, a court on Wednesday began deliberating
on whether the former dictator should stand trial on human rights
abuse charges.
</P>
<P>
   Judges will decide if Pinochet can keep the immunity from
prosecution he currently enjoys as a senator-for-life, a post he
created for himself during his 1973-90 regime.
</P>
<P>
   As the court began its deliberation, police sealed off the
building in downtown Santiago with crowd control fences and kept
the rival groups apart. Streets around the building were closed to
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Pinochet demonstrators, including members of leftist groups
and human rights organizations, protested at one end of the
block-long building. They carried photographs of alleged victims of
Pinochet's rule and signs demanding a trial of the former ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Police confined the ex-dictator's supporters to an opposing
corner. The activists carried posters showing a smiling Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet returned home in February after being held for 16
months in London, where he blocked efforts to have him extradited
to Spain for trial. He was released by Britain after doctors there
determined he was physically and mentally unfit for trial, a
conclusion supported by his doctors in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   As the 21 judges of the Santiago Court of Appeals listened
lengthy report by investigator Juan Guzman who had requested and
end to the immunity, sporadic clashes erupted outside. Police
detained several demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to the report, the judges were to hear on
Thursday and Friday the arguments by the lawyers for Pinochet and
the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The judges did not immediately rule on a request by Pinochet's
defense lawyer that medical tests be ordered to determine whether
the 84-year-old former ruler is fit enough to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official report, 3,191 people were killed or
disappeared during Pinochet's 17 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Pinochet had defended himself through retired Gen
Luis Cortes, a close associate. After meeting with Pinochet, Cortes
said: ''He told me: 'Please tell everybody that I never ordered
anybody to be killed or tortured.''

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Tram Displays Grim Past  </HEADLINE>
By MARINA SYSOYEVA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Among the hundreds of trams that crisscross
Kiev's streets, only one offers passengers a journey inside a
mobile museum of the world's worst nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Chernobyl tram has rolled through the streets of the
Ukrainian capital for five years. After being out of service for
several months for repairs, it returned on the eve of Wednesday's
14th anniversary of the accident, taking the memory of the disaster
back to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Inside hang 50 photographs of ''liquidators,'' the workers who
were exposed to radiation while cleaning up after a reactor at the
power plant exploded and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   Songs for those who died from the accident play over the
loudspeaker, and driver Valentyn Maltsev tells the tram's history
between announcing stops.
</P>
<P>
   The grim ride leaves passengers with a mix of emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a terrifying impression,'' said one, a hotel porter who
gave her name only as Halya. ''It is the right thing to do, but
those photos ...'' She broke off to wipe away swelling tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel odd here,'' said Harkusha Yana, a schoolgirl who was
born the year of the accident. Her friend Olena, 12, said that
although she hadn't been born when the accident occurred, she was
still saddened by the images in the tram.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chernobyl is our pain'' reads a sign on the side of the tram,
and for many of the passengers, part of that pain comes with the
memory of having been deceived after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities tried to mask the accident for several days, and
many people were exposed to radiation by ignorance. Ukraine was at
that time part of the Soviet Union, where officials routinely tried
to cover up problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody said anything,'' said passenger Avhust Skrypin, who was
working near his country house in the open air just days after the
accident, unaware that the fire had released a cloud of radiation
over Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped the tram would ''make people's character more
humane.''
</P>
<P>
   Onboard boxes mounted with Orthodox Christian icons invite
donations to a fund for Chernobyl victims. The driver gets a wage,
but the vehicle's upkeep is contributed by volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   But the tram is in desperate need of financial support so that
it can be refurbished, Maltsev complained.
</P>
<P>
   People pay as much as they can afford for the trip. But even
though many pay more than the fare of about 9 cents, the tram
collects only $8 to $12 a day.

<HEADLINE> HUD Sued Over Smith &AMP; Wesson Deal  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven gun makers and an industry group sued
the Department of Housing and Urban Development and 16 cities
Wednesday over a plan to give preferential treatment to Smith &AMP;
Wesson when buying guns for law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in an Atlanta federal court alleges an illegal
conspiracy in restraint of trade.
</P>
<P>
   In March, President Clinton announced a landmark gun safety
agreement with Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest gun maker. The
plan included the installation of gun locks on all the weapons it
sells, the introduction within three years of ''smart gun''
technology, and barring sales of its weapons at gun shows without a
background check.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Smith &AMP; Wesson was to be dropped from
lawsuits against gun makers that were being contemplated by federal
officials and some cities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Smith &AMP; Wesson, any other gun maker that agreed
to the plan would also be given preferential treatment. Smith &AMP;
Wesson has been the only gun maker to sign onto the agreement thus
far.
</P>
<P>
   ''These local officials have tried everything from litigation to
economic extortion to compel compliance on a national level with
their own individual ideas about gun design, ownership and
distribution,'' said Robert Delfay, president of the National
Shooting Sports Foundation, a gun industry group that is a party in
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names as defendants New York Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer and Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who
helped draw up the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Also named were the California communities of San Francisco,
Berkeley, East Palo Alto, Inglewood, Oakland, and San Mateo; as
well as Bridgeport, Conn.; Atlanta; Miami-Dade County, Fla.; Gary,
Ind.; Boston; Detroit; St. Louis; Newark, N.J.; Philadelphia; and
the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are demanding cities stop the effort of using their
purchasing power to control the distribution and design of
firearms,'' said Jeff Reh, general counsel for Beretta U.S.A. Corp,
one of the seven suing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Reh said the mayors were attempting to expand their authority
beyond their cities. HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo called the lawsuit
''frivolous'' and said it was ''a vain attempt to distract from
their (gun makers') failure to take responsibility for there share
of the tragic problem of gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Comment on the lawsuit from Capitol Hill was swift and partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am disappointed that some gun manufacturers have chosen
confrontation over cooperation,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J. ''The federal government isn't asking for much, only that
these companies help adopt common sense measures to keep guns from
ending up in the wrong hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he thinks the Clinton
administration overstepped its authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the allegations of the complaint filed today ... it now
appears the administration seeks to further its goals by
circumventing the will of Congress and illegitimately bringing the
weight of the executive branch to bear on law-biding firearm
manufacturers,'' Hatch said.

<HEADLINE> Jurors Hit a Snag in Edwards' Trial  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Jurors deliberating whether former Gov.
Edwin Edwards and six others extorted millions of dollars suggested
in a note Wednesday that there is disagreement over at least one of
the charges in the complex case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told them to move on to a different charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not able to reach an agreement on any of what we are
working on. At what point do we give up and go to another charge?''
jurors said in a note to the judge in their second day of
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication which part of the indictment the note
referred to. However, the first of the 26 counts against Edwards
involved six alleged racketeering acts that the jurors must
consider individually.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and his six co-defendants are accused of taking part in
or aiding a series of extortion plots involving the licensing of
riverboat casinos. The indictment has scores of counts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola called the jurors into open
court and told them they could deliberate on any charge they want
and do not have to follow the order in which they are set down on
the verdict form.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Attorney Harry Rosenberg said the note was a good
sign for the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defendants' attorneys may not be out buying champagne but
they should be out drinking a cold beer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' federal racketeering trial started Jan. 10 and
deliberations began Monday afternoon. Jurors deliberated for 5{
hours Wednesday before breaking shortly before 2 p.m. so one juror
could take his wife to a doctor's appointment.

<HEADLINE> Philips To Cut 1,500 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA, Ohio (AP) -- A plant that makes television picture tubes
for Philips Electronics plans to lay off 1,500 workers, or 80
percent of its work force, beginning in 2001 and move most of the
work to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision will be made by the end of May, said Dave
Thompson, spokesman for the Philips Display Components Co.
subsidiary. He said the company has a tentative agreement with a
site in north central Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts would take place over a three-year period, Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Philips, the world's largest maker of picture tubes, is
transferring the work to Mexico to cut costs and because of
declining sales prices, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also allows the company to move near more of its
customers, Thompson said. About 90 percent of the companies that
provide the plant's customer base have moved or are planning to
move to Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 employees would remain at the Ottawa plant to make
large picture tubes, but most of its work would be moved to Mexico,
Thompson said. The plant's four main manufacturing lines will be
moved one at a time, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The plant makes 4.2 million picture tubes each year for
television sets made by Philips and other manufacturers in the
United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the plant were notified of the planned layoffs
Wednesday.

'Jitney' Proves Playwright's Talent   
An AP Entertainment Review, 
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Right from the beginning, August Wilson was
quite a storyteller, a playwright unafraid of big themes, big
emotions and vividly drawn characters.
</P>
<P>
   The proof can be found at off-Broadway's Second Stage, where
''Jitney,'' a revised version of his first full-length play, has
finally made it to New York, some two decades after it was written.
The only question: What took it so long?
</P>
<P>
   In ''Jitney,'' Wilson skillfully recreates a very specific
environment, the world of gypsy cab drivers who gather between
fares in a rundown Pittsburgh storefront that's soon to be
demolished.
</P>
<P>
   It's a world of prickly camaraderie -- with occasional violence,
which snakes through the casual banter and posturing of these
drivers. Wilson populates this informal club with some memorable
people, a group of black men brought to life in this tough-minded
production by a superb collection of actors.
</P>
<P>
   The most showy is Turnbo, the club gossip, played to
scene-stealing perfection by a fireplug named Stephen McKinley
Henderson. ''I'm just talking what I know,'' Turnbo says, defending
his gleeful recitation of news, good and bad, about the residents
of the Hill District, the black area of Pittsburgh where the play
is set.
</P>
<P>
   Turnbo lives to irritate Youngblood, a young Vietnam vet
(Russell Hornsby), who, it appears, is cheating on his girlfriend
Rena (Michole Briana White).
</P>
<P>
   The playwright stuffs his play, which is set in 1977, with
enough plot for three dramas. At its core is a bitter estrangement
between father and son. Becker (Paul Butler) runs the jitney
operation that ferries poor blacks ignored by regular cab
companies. In that respect, ''Jitney'' resembles ''Fences,''
Wilson's biggest Broadway success, which also focuses on a volatile
family relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Becker's son, Booster, has just gotten out of prison after
serving 20 years for killing a white woman. Once the bright light
of his family, Booster can't bridge the distrust and disappointment
that have grown between the two men while he has been in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Butler and Carl Lumbly, who plays Booster, square off in several
fierce confrontations that show Wilson at his explosive best.
Director Marion McClinton knows how to handle these battles, which
punctuate the proceedings as if they were gunshots -- unexpected,
quick and emotionally devastating.
</P>
<P>
   But they are part of a larger landscape, which designer David
Gallo has physically created on a marvelous set showing the dingy
jitney waiting room as well as aging automobiles parked beyond the
building's dirty windows.
</P>
<P>
   Life within this room is the family most of these men don't
have, and the playwright doesn't stint in the ways he has these
guys bond -- not only bond but stay together.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's Wilson's marvelous language that makes this evening
soar. The talk is tough, of the street, but there is a poetry to
it, not to mention a sense of humor that is honest and very, very
funny. His ear is unerring in its ability to capture what these men
say -- and don't say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jitney'' began Wilson's cycle of ten, decade-by-decade plays
mirroring the black experience in 20th century America. Judging
from this production, it was an auspicious beginning, an amazing
preview of what was to come in the next 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Leafs-Devils Is Speed Vs. Defense  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The debate on whether speed beats defense has
raged for years. Toronto and New Jersey will try to settle it in
their second-round series.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs, who play host to the Devils when the best-of-seven
series begins Thursday, sit firmly in the offensive corner.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not for me to decide how the game should be played. I'm
only a guy who tries to get his own guys to play a certain way,''
coach Pat Quinn said following practice Wednesday. ''It
(offensively) is the way that I like and hopefully (the players)
like too. It happens to be just a different philosophical
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense is also a part of the Leafs' game, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not as if the Toronto Maple Leafs don't have to check to
win. We do,'' Quinn said. ''We just don't want to fall back and be
the Maginot Line. We want to try to do it in a different fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, not the way New Jersey plays, which many purists
-- especially in Canada -- consider to be on the snoring side of
boring.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' Bobby Holik makes no apologies for a team with a
smothering defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you win, nothing's boring,'' said Holik, a member of the
1995 Stanley Cup championship Devils team that patented the
trapping style. ''Even the fans, no matter where you go, they like
winning. If at the end of the day you win, then everybody's
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   No one's happy just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have had a week to rest, coming off a four-game
first-round sweep of the Florida Panthers. It's their challenge to
find enough offense, while at the same time shutting down Toronto's
big guns.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs' line of Steve Thomas, Mats Sundin and Jonas Hoglund
is particularly intimidating, accounting for 10 of the 17 goals
Toronto scored in eliminating Ottawa in six games. Second-liner
Sergei Berezin is no slouch either, coming off a 26-goal regular
season, plus three in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a team that's going to score goals. It doesn't matter
how well we're going to play defensively, they have the talent to
put the puck in the net,'' Devils goalie Martin Brodeur said. ''We
have to minimize that as much as we can and get some momentum on
our side defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils will also try to rattle Toronto goalie Curtis Joseph,
going as far as to threaten to ''camp out'' in the Leafs goal
crease.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs' challenges are maintaining discipline and
creating enough offensive opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to cut down on our mistakes, especially on the blue
line,'' Sundin said. ''We have to get the puck deep and try to play
deep and use our speed, hopefully create enough chances on Brodeur
to score some goals on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams are meeting for the first time in the playoffs.
The Leafs hold the all-time regular-season edge going 40-23-16
against New Jersey, including 3-0-1 this season. Not much, however,
separated the two teams in the standings as both teams won 45
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils are minus Sergei Brylin (knee) while forward Jason
Arnott is nursing a sore wrist but should play. The Maple Leafs are
banged up, missing Yanic Perreault (knee) Nik Antropov (knee) and
Bryan Berard (eye).
</P>
<P>
   ''We know they're a very explosive hockey club and have lots of
offense,'' said the Devils' Alexander Mogilny. ''We can't afford to
start doing run-and-gun hockey with those guys. We just want to
make sure we're playing our game, sound defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Toronto's Darcy Tucker: ''Good defense is good offense
sometimes. We're trying to make that our thing for this series, to
play in their end of the ice and not so much in our end. Hopefully,
that will be our defense.''

<HEADLINE> Regulators approve New Jersey pipeline; Ohio plan still in limbo  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators approved a plan to expand a
long-distance natural gas pipeline in New Jersey and Pennsylvania,
but gave a company a deadline to find a new gas supply.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Attorney General John J. Farmer said Wednesday the
state would appeal the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
decision to let Houston-based Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corp.
add 91 miles of pipeline in 10 New Jersey counties.
</P>
<P>
   The commission ''overlooked the impact such construction would
have on the residents and the environment,'' Farmer said Wednesday.
He said the appeal would be filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may not be FERC's priority, but the safety of our residents
and the protection of our environment are my priorities,'' said
U.S. Rep. Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, R-N.J. ''The Transco pipeline
must be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Transco spokesman Chris Stockton said the company's MarketLink
extension was expanding along the paths of existing pipelines in
both states.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have operated our existing pipeline safely, not just in New
Jersey but in 13 states,'' Stockton said. ''We've never had a
public injury in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners gave Transco permission Tuesday to begin building
the 150-mile project through northeastern Pennsylvania and central
and northern New Jersey, provided the company has signed contracts
for 100 percent of the gas that would move through the system,
spokeswoman Tamara Young-Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline, intended to move gas from the Chicago to New York,
was first proposed by a partnership of natural gas sellers:
Transco, Coastal Corp.'s ANR Pipeline Co. and National Fuel Gas
Supply Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Before regulators give similar permission for that project,
known as the Independence Pipeline, they said they want to see
contracts for at least 35 percent of capacity by a certain date.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they don't submit those within 60 days their application
will be dismissed,'' Young-Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   FERC had voted in December to deny permission for the
Independence Pipeline to break ground, and said then the proposal
could be revived with enough signed contracts to prove the
construction is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline would go through 31 municipalities in ten New
Jersey counties -- Bergen, Burlington, Essex, Hunterdon, Middlesex,
Morris, Passaic, Somerset, Union and Warren. In Pennsylvania, it
would add to pipelines in Lycoming, Northampton, Clinton and
Columbia counties.
</P>
<P>
   Both portions of the pipeline proposal have generated local
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, homeowners, environmental experts and politicians
have said the project isn't necessary, threatens wetlands and might
pose a safety risk in densely populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials have been wary of gas pipelines since a gas
explosion leveled much of an Edison apartment complex in 1994,
injuring more than 100 people and forcing 1,000 residents to flee.
Gov. Christie Whitman has said the pipeline could cause safety
hazards and hurt her efforts to preserve open space in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Transco maintains that the new pipelines are needed because
their existing network is at 100 percent of capacity and the
company anticipates the increased use of natural gas to fuel power
plants in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Safety also is a concern in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Farmers in
northern Ohio have complained that it would disrupt costly drainage
systems on which agriculture there depends.

<P>
   FLORENCE, Ala. (AP) -- A trip to grandma's meant a brush with a
news headliner for 6-year-old Ashlie Fristoe and 9-year-old
Brittanie Fristoe.
</P>
<P>
   As much of the nation watched the Elian Gonzalez drama unfold,
they shared a pizza with the 6-year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters from Muscle Shoals were staying with their

Maryland on Saturday when Elian was reunited with his Cuban father
at the base -- just hours after he had been removed from the home of
his Miami relatives in the widely reported raid by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   The girls, however, got a personal look at the focus of all the
attention, the TimesDaily newspaper in Florence reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When the girls realized the famous guest was in their hotel,
they and their grandmother asked one of the numerous federal agents
on the base if they could meet the little boy.
</P>
<P>
   The agents asked Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who said
yes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was excited,'' Brittanie told the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Brittanie, who gave Elian a stuffed animal, said Elian was nice
but quiet and they had to use an interpreter to communicate. She
also told the TimesDaily that the boy looked sad. The encounter
lasted only a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez gave the sisters pizza, Brittanie said. And
when they left, Elian gave Ashlie a kiss on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' mother, Diane Fristoe, educates her daughters with
home-schooling and they had discussed Elian's plight during
lessons. Fristoe said she hopes the opportunity to meet Elian while
he's a focus of international politics provided a lesson for her
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It brings television, newspaper and magazine reports on this
on a more personal level,'' she said. ''It lets them know it's
real.''

<HEADLINE> Nets Fire Coach Don Casey  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Don Casey was fired Wednesday as
coach of the New Jersey Nets in the first move of an expected
housecleaning by the team.
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Nash and president Michael Rowe also are in
danger of losing their jobs after the Nets (31-51) missed the
playoffs for the second straight year. Principal owner Lewis Katz
said no decision has been reached on their futures.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who never got the Nets turned around after replacing John
Calipari on March 15, 1999, went 44-68 in 1{ years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very difficult decision to make because Casey had
been a friend of mine for more than three decades,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, 62, did not immediately return a telephone call left at
his home by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   By making the move a week after the end of the regular season,
the team will save $1.3 million, since the second year of the
contract Casey signed on June 25 was not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Katz also announced New Jersey would hire a director of
basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Julius Erving, an executive vice president with
the Orlando Magic and former Nets star, is being considered for
that new position, the Orlando Sentinel reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There also are several candidates for the coaching job,
including NBA great Isiah Thomas; St. John's coach Mike Jarvis;
Utah coach Rick Majerus; Lenny Wilkens, who recently quit as coach
of the Atlanta Hawks; former player Maurice Cheeks; and former Net
Rick Mahorn.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets will probably try to get a high-profile coach to
improve their tarnished image, which is what they tired to do last
year.
</P>
<P>
   They went after Phil Jackson after Casey finished out Calipari's
season in 1999 with a 13-17 record, but the former Chicago Bulls
coach signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Casey will stay with the Nets doing charitable and community
work.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts of assistant coaches Jim Lynam, Eddie Jordan and
Mike O'Koren will expire in June.
</P>
<P>
   The firing of Casey has been expected for weeks, not only
because the injury-plagued Nets struggled this season but also
because Katz was reportedly under pressure from YankeeNets, the
joint operation that oversees the Nets and Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The sports and entertainment regional power was concerned about
securing future TV contracts if the Nets were not an attractive
product.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey showed potential at times this season, but the team
could not overcome a 2-15 start and a 2-14 finish, which was capped
by a season-ending 11-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the problem was injuries. Former All-Star center
Jayson Williams missed the entire season because of a knee injury
and broken leg on April 1, 1999, in a game against Atlanta.
Shooting guard Kerry Kittles was bothered all season by a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Casey also could not get his team to win close games. It was
10-24 in games decided by five points or less.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stephon Marbury and Keith Van Horn helped the Nets post a
27-22 record in the middle of the season, a run that got New Jersey
within striking distance of the eighth and final playoff berth in
the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   However, late-season injuries to Marbury and Kittles ended their
playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank the Nets ownership for giving me the
opportunity to coach the team,'' Casey said. ''I strongly believe
the Nets have a bright future.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey spent much of the last week fending off questions about
his expected firing.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the NBA in 1976, the Nets have changed coaches 12
times, including five times since 1989. They have made the playoffs
10 times in that period, making it past the first round only once
and never past the second.
</P>
<P>
   The head coaching job was the second for Casey in the league. He
took over the Clippers from Gene Shue during the 1988-89 season and
went 41-85 in 1{ years.
</P>
<P>
   A former coach at Temple, Casey joined the NBA in 1982 as an
assistant with Chicago and then spent a year as a head coach in
Italy. He joined the Clippers in 1984, went to Boston for six years
after being released by the Clippers and then joined Calipari's
staff in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey made the playoffs in Calipari's second season, but
Calipari was fired after the team got off to a 3-17 start in the
lockout-shortened 1999 season. Casey took over and the team played
well down the stretch, posting a 13-17 record.

<HEADLINE> Report: Leading Haiti Cop Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- The man responsible for
investigating the misdeeds of Haiti's troubled police force has
resigned, a leading newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman would not confirm the resignation of Luc
Eucher Joseph, head of the police internal affairs division, but a
foreign diplomat, speaking on condition that his name not be used,
said Joseph quit Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The departure fueled fears that police, who have faced criticism
for their failure to rein in a wave of political violence, will be
unable to provide security during May 21 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph had received high marks from international officials for
his efforts to root out corruption in the police force, especially
among officers accused of involvement in cocaine-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   But during violent street demonstrations last year, supporters
of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide accused police of doing
little to fight crime and demanded the resignations of Joseph and
Robert Manuel, then the national security undersecretary.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel resigned in October, charging that Aristide activists
were trying to destabilize local and legislative elections, which
have been postponed three times since November.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel's likely successor was assassinated the day after he
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Le Nouvelliste, the country's most respected independent
newspaper, reported that Joseph has been given a job in the Haitian
mission at the United Nations in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 29, 10 people have been killed in politically
related violence in Haiti and no arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian civilian police force -- numbered at more than 5,000
officers -- was deployed in June 1995 after the dismantling of the
Haitian army that had ousted Aristide in a bloody 1991 coup.
</P>
<P>
   By October 1999, the police had weeded 407 officers on charges
ranging from human rights abuses to theft and drug-dealing, Amnesty
International reported.

<HEADLINE> Dead Twin Fetuses Found in WVU Dorm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Police searched Wednesday for the
mother of twin fetuses found in a bathroom at a West Virginia
University dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   A custodian found the fetuses, believed to be about three to six
months developed, in Lyon Tower on the university's Evansdale
campus about 7:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The twins could have been stillborn or aborted, said university
spokeswoman Becky Lofstead. The identity of the mother was unknown,
but she is most likely a student, Lofstead said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're concerned about mother's health and well-being. She
might need medical treatment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fetuses were sent to the state medical examiner for an
autopsy.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Suspect Faces Adult Charges  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 16-year-old boy accused of shooting seven
children at the National Zoo will be charged as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Bernard Jones, who police say is the son of a convicted
drug enforcer, is charged with assault with intent to commit murder
while armed in the shooting of an 11-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who remains in critical condition with a gunshot wound
to the head, was wounded when Jones allegedly opened fire on a
group of young people outside the zoo Monday, police said. Police
have said the shooting stemmed from a quarrel between two groups of
youths.
</P>
<P>
   Six other children between 12 and 16 years old were also hurt
but they were all treated and released from hospitals. Jones, who
was arrested Tuesday, will probably face other charges, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   At his arraignment Wednesday, Jones was ordered held without
bond pending a May 12 preliminary hearing. If convicted, Jones
faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''This 16-year-old acted alone out of anger,'' said Terrance W.
Gainer, the Metropolitan Police Department's executive assistant
police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' attorney, Renee Raymond, refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Jones is the son of 44-year-old James Antonio Jones,
who once was an enforcer for the Rayful Edmond drug ring. Officials
said it used to be the largest drug enterprise in the city's
history, bringing as much as 1,700 pounds of cocaine into
Washington a month.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Jones was sentenced to 29 years in prison after a 1990
drug conspiracy conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Gainer said police know where Jones threw the 9 mm handgun they
believe was used in the shootings but the weapon has not been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The quick arrest and Wednesday's reopening of the zoo helped
restore calm to the area. ''I think it's been taken care of. And
I'm not afraid,'' said Faye Griffith, who jogs regularly on the
landscaped grounds of the 163-acre facility.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging problems with youth and gun violence, Mayor
Anthony Williams says Washington a safe city with a declining crime
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The city's homicide rate was down nearly 8 percent through the
end of March, and the overall serious crimes including robberies,
assaults, and arsons were down 13.5 percent during the same period,
police records show.

<HEADLINE> Bryant: Lakers Ready for Real Thing  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kobe Bryant says the Los Angeles Lakers are
tired of beating up on each other. They'll finally get a chance to
beat up the Sacramento Kings on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think guys are a little antsy, agitated,'' Bryant said after
practice Wednesday, a workout both Bryant and coach Phil Jackson
said was much better than the previous day's practice. ''PJ
(Jackson) says it's important for us to take care of business. It's
imperative we defend our homecourt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have done an excellent job in that area since Staples
Center opened last fall. Their 117-107 victory over the Kings on
Sunday in Game 1 of the first-round best-of-five playoff series was
their 37th win in 43 home games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings realize a victory in Game 2 is a must if they're going
to have a realistic chance at upsetting the Lakers, who entered the
playoffs heavily favored to win their first championship since
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll try to get that first win and go from there,'' Kings
coach Rick Adelman said. ''They held homecourt. We're trying to get
a split, then hold homecourt at our place.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the Kings would become just the third No. 8
seed to beat a No. 1 seed since the 16-team playoff format was
adopted 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if we can win this one, it's going to put a tremendous
amount of pressure on them,'' said Glen Rice, who scored 18 points
to help the Lakers win Game 1. ''We definitely want to try and put
this team away.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson remembers how close the Kings came to upsetting Utah in
the first round last spring, extending the Jazz to overtime in the
fifth and deciding game. And that was after Utah won the opener
117-87.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a fine, young team, they have the potential,'' Jackson
said. ''I'd like to sweep the series, I'd like to sweep the
championship, I'd like to go 15-0. The less you have to play in the
playoffs, the better; the less chance of injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but also the more chance of rust.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a good practice today, short and right to the point of
what we wanted to do,'' Jackson said. ''I think we're OK. Everybody
seemed to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called Tuesday's practice one of the season's worst, but
cited the down time between games as a possible factor. Both the
Lakers and Kings enter Game 2 having played just once -- against
each other last Sunday -- since the regular season ended four days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Teams seldom have four days between games during the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, who had 46 points, 17 rebounds and five
blocked shots in Game 1, said the extra time between games is fine
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good for me, I can get a lot of rest, chill out at the
crib,'' he said. ''We'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal realizes the Kings will attempt to do a better job on him
defensively, but smiled when asked what could be done to stop him,
replying, ''Nothing. I'm telling you, I've got 350 moves on each
block. I'm a 7-footer who can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Game 1, the Kings said O'Neal got away with camping in
the key and barging into them to get into position for his shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm good enough to go around people, I don't have to go
through them,'' he said. ''I'll never have to go through (Kings
center) Vlade Divac, period. If we got all the calls, how come they
shot 35 free throws and we shot 14?''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, but Kings star Chris Webber fouled out with 6:53
remaining, after scoring 28 points in 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully I'll get more time than 27 minutes, and more than
five rebounds,'' he said. ''Rebounding is a key, it was a glaring
statistic why we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers outrebounded the Kings 54-37.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said he believes Game 2 will be officiated differently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think at first, the game might be called under a microscope,
to an extent,'' Bryant said. ''As the game goes on, the calls will
loosen up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant also said he believes the Kings enter Game 2 with the
same confidence they've always had.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have nothing to lose,'' he said. ''They'll come back and
play.''

<HEADLINE> Spain Court Sentences Ex-Officers  </HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The National Court sentenced five former
security force members to more than 65 years each for their part in
the torture and murder of two suspected Basque separatists, defense
lawyers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences ended the second so-called 'dirty war' trial, and
added weight to allegations that a dirty war sponsored by the
former Socialist governments of Felipe Gonzalez was waged in the
early 1980s against suspected Basque separatists and sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has consistently denied that his government was
involved in any such war, though the first 'dirty war' trial two
years ago convicted one of Gonzalez' former ministers and several
ex-security officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist party said in a statement that the guilty verdict
showed that the actions of the death squads were never promoted by
the government of Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the accused in the latest case were informed
Wednesday that the three-judge tribunal had sentenced Gen. Enrique
Rodriguez Galindo and Julen Elgorriaba, former representative of
the Interior Ministry in the Basque region, to 71 years each for
kidnapping and killing the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Civil Guard member Angel Vaquero was given 69 years in jail,
and former security force members Felipe Bayo and Enrique Dorado
were each given 67 years on the same charges.
</P>
<P>
   All five were ordered to pay $138,000 to each of the victims'
families.
</P>
<P>
   None of the five appeared in court for the sentencing, state-run
Efe news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Antonio Lasa and Jose Ignacio Zabala -- two young men
suspected of belonging to the armed Basque separatist group, ETA --
were abducted Oct. 15, 1983, in the southern French town of
Bayonne.
</P>
<P>
   ETA, which has been blamed for the deaths of nearly 800 people
in its 32-year drive for Basque independence, was particularly
active at that time.
</P>
<P>
   The group used southern France as a hide-out, and Spanish
security forces retaliated by staging kidnapping raids in the
neighboring country, according to declassified Spanish military
intelligence documents.
</P>
<P>
   Lasa and Zabala were driven across the border into the Spanish
Basque area, where they were tortured for several days. They were
each killed with a gunshot to the head.

<HEADLINE> Al Fayed Not Entitled to Documents  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW BARAKAT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday
that Mohamed Al Fayed isn't entitled to U.S. government records
related to his son and Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Egyptian-born multimillionaire sought all
documents concerning his son Dodi and Diana, who were killed in a
1997 car crash in Paris, as well as documents pertaining to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed has said he believes there was a murder conspiracy by
people who disapproved of Diana's relationship with his son. An
investigation by a French magistrate blamed their driver, who tests
reveal was drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed initially sought the information from the National
Security Agency under the Freedom of Information Act. NSA refused,
saying release of the information created the possibility of
''exceptionally grave damage'' to national security.
</P>
<P>
   The agency says its documents about Diana contain only
incidental references and she was never a target of surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed's request under a different federal law was rejected in
Wednesday's ruling. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
unanimously upheld the decision of a lower court judge who
determined Al Fayed was trying ''to make an end run around'' the
Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls Wednesday afternoon to Al Fayed spokeswoman Laurie
Meyer in London were not answered.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department was pleased with the ruling, said
spokesman Charles Miller.

<HEADLINE> Bosox Hurler Pedro Martinez Is Hot  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- By Pedro Martinez's standards, it was a
tough game. He trailed and gave up two earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   The result was still the same for the Boston ace.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming a nine-day layoff and his first deficit since last
September, Martinez beat Texas 6-3 Tuesday night for his 10th
straight regular-season victory, a career best. The streak is 12,
counting his two 1999 postseason wins.
</P>
<P>
   And the two-time Cy Young winner insists he's still not at his
best this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I might not be quite where I want to be,'' Martinez said.
''I'll wait and see but I hope I feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (4-0) admitted Wednesday that he was a little more sore
than usual after the extended layoff. He hopes to be getting back
on a normal schedule after his latest start was pushed back by four
straight rainouts.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rangers scored two runs without getting a ball out of
the infield to take a 2-1 lead in the second inning, Martinez was
behind for the first time since Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Martinez had trailed was against the Yankees, when
Chili Davis hit a second-inning homer for a 1-0 lead. Martinez went
on to pitch a one-hitter that day and began a streak of 54 1-3
consecutive innings in the regular season with the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Other than falling behind, the only other obvious negatives for
Martinez were that his American League-best ERA increased from 1.27
to 1.59 and he surrendered a solo homer to Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo's homer was only the 11th Martinez has allowed since the
beginning of 1998, all of them with the bases empty. The other four
Rangers hits off of him were singles, including two infield hits in
the second.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's far and away the best pitcher out there,'' said Kenny
Rogers, Texas' No. 1 starter and the winner of Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could maybe put Randy (Johnson) up with him, but Pedro's
got more stuff. He's got more pitches and throws just as hard. He's
not just overpowering with his stuff, but he also uses a mentality
of pitching to the hitter's weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers maintained their 2-1 lead over Martinez until the
sixth. That is when the Red Sox scored four unearned runs after an
error on a potential inning-ending double play grounder.
</P>
<P>
   ''You knew at the time that was all he needed,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he didn't feel right, Martinez threw 68 of his 103
pitches for strikes, walking just one and hitting a batter. He left
after seven innings, even though he said he felt stronger as the
game went on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could have gone probably one more inning, but we're playing
it safe really early in the season,'' Martinez said. ''You'd much
rather play it safe at this time of the year where you still have
to recover from a loss or whatever, than losing your ace for the
whole season.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez hasn't lost since last Aug. 19 to Oakland and Tim
Hudson. He avenged that defeat when he beat Hudson and the A's in
his previous start, April 15, but hadn't pitched since because of
the rainouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pedro goes out there, he's got a mindset. When he puts the
ball in his hand, he does his job and gives us an opportunity to
win,'' Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra said.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Center-Left Gov't Sworn In  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Italy swore in its 58th postwar government Wednesday
with a new prime minister but the same bickering center-left
parties, united chiefly in the desire to keep Silvio Berlusconi's
surging conservatives from power.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously for the future of his eight-party coalition, Premier
Giuliano Amato -- a 61-year-old veteran known as ''Dr. Subtle'' for
his political finesse -- proved unable to quell squabbling over
Cabinet posts even long enough for the oath-taking.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony played out at the presidential palace before
Amato's 23 appointees and one vacant brocade chair -- left empty
after Edo Ronchi of the Greens rejected the post of European Union
minister in pique at not being offered the job of environment
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The flap gave the government its first crisis before it even had
its new mandate, and raised the possibility that the Greens would
pull out of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good luck,'' former Premier Massimo D'Alema told Amato,
shaking his successor's hand for the cameras. D'Alema was brought
down by much the same kind of squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   Amato served as D'Alema's treasury minister and as premier for
10 months in 1992-93, when Italy's political system was rocked by
corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left under D'Alema was trounced April 16 in regional
elections by the forces of Berlusconi, a media mogul eager for what
would be his second turn as premier.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left jettisoned D'Alema and turned its efforts toward
making Berlusconi wait for that turn, at least until parliamentary
elections scheduled for spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
   President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi ignored Berlusconi's demand for
immediate elections, and instead offered Amato the chance to form
another center-left government.
</P>
<P>
   But some have criticized Amato's Cabinet picks, announced
Tuesday night. Except for the names at the top, the new Cabinet
list is stuffed with names familiar from previous center-left
governments -- including that of Lamberto Dini, hanging on to his
job as foreign minister under three premiers now.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a formation that speaks for itself, put in place with the
sole purpose of keeping the left in power,'' Berlusconi said.
</P>
<P>
   Center-left senator Antonio Di Pietro faulted Amato for making
Cabinet choices that seemed to have more to do with political
expediency than expertise. ''They've only shuffled the seats,'' he
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Amato's new government now must pass a majority vote of
confidence in Parliament. The Chamber of Deputies, or lower house,
is to vote Friday, while the Senate vote is expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   Amato postponed his first Cabinet meeting until Thursday, saying
new Health Minister Umberto Veronesi, Italy's leading cancer
doctor, had medical appointments he could not break.
</P>
<P>
   Amato's coalition ranges from former Communists to Communist
hard-liners to liberal former Christian Democrats. A former
Socialist, he is serving now as an independent.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Millionaires Threatened  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels say they will begin
kidnapping millionaires and corporate executives who refuse to bow
to extortion demands aimed at funding the guerrilla insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel statement, read to the media late Tuesday by the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, was the boldest
statement yet of a long-standing rebel practice of extorting and
kidnapping the wealthy to finance its nearly four decade-old
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement seemed to contradict recent indications that
the FARC, Colombia's largest rebel group, was considering a
cease-fire. It also follows recent guerrilla contacts with leading
businessmen aimed at boosting fledgling peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting angrily to rebel statement Wednesday, President Andres
Pastrana blasted the FARC, saying it was ''incomprehensible'' that
the guerrilla group would announce a kidnapping plan with
cease-fire discussions slated to begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's statement came on the same day as the resignation of
his chief peace envoy, Victor Ricardo.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo -- a key player in shepherding peace talks with the FARC
-- denied his decision to step down was linked to death threats he
said he recently received from right-wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo was a controversial figure in Pastrana's government,
often bearing public criticism for the president's perceived
naivete in dealing with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has made peace with the FARC his government's top
priority despite mounting criticism of ongoing rebel attacks and
kidnappings since negotiations began last year.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has the highest kidnapping rate in the world, and the
problem is getting worse. Last year, 2,945 people were abducted,
about half by leftist rebels. Common criminal gangs were the second
biggest culprits.
</P>
<P>
   In the three-point communique read by guerrilla field marshal
Jorge Briceno, the FARC said its extortion policy was needed to
counter government aggression fueled by its taxes on multinational
corporations and ''Yankee imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas oppose a $1.7 billion anti-narcotics aid package
for Colombia under discussion in Washington, seeing it as a veiled
plan to defeat the FARC under the guise of the drug war. Along with
extortion, a key source of FARC revenue are ''taxes'' it levies on
drug traffickers and laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rebel policy, individuals or heads of companies
worth more than $1 million who refuse to pay an unspecified tax
will be kidnapped. ''Their liberation will depend on a ransom to be
determined,'' the FARC added.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have moved slowly amid criticism of strong-arm
guerrilla rule in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto Borda, a former peace envoy and political analyst at
Bogota's Javeriana University, said the rebels could be trying to
reassert the widely discredited notion that they are ''Robin
Hoods'' -- stealing from the rich in order to serve the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas' image has deteriorated sharply amid rising rebel
involvement in the drug trade and widespread kidnappings of
Colombians of all means, Borda added.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Catholic Church said the rebels have
begun extorting parishes around the country and threatening priests
who refuse to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The army estimates the FARC earns about $10 million a month from
extortion and took in about $84 million from ransom kidnappings
last year alone. The guerrillas claim those numbers are wildly
inflated.

<HEADLINE> Blister Doesn't Bother Cubs' Wood  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Kerry Wood threw on the side before the Chicago
Cubs' game against the Houston Astros on Wednesday, and had no
problems with a blister that threatened to further delay his return
to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, who started the season on the disabled list after missing
last year recovering from right elbow surgery, developed a blister
on the middle finger of his throwing hand during a rehab start at
Triple-A Iowa on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no burning sensation at all,'' Cubs manager Don
Baylor said of Wood's blister. ''We'll wait a couple of days to
find out when he can pitch for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring any setbacks, Woods, 22, will start either Saturday or
Sunday against the Arizona Diamondbacks when the Cubs return to
Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the NL Rookie of the Year in 1998, had surgery last April
8 and missed the entire 1999 season. Wood tied a major league
record by striking out 20 Houston Astros during his rookie season.

<HEADLINE> House passes bill to give World War II vets high school diplomas  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The House of Representatives unanimously
passed a bill Wednesday that would grant diplomas to World War II
veterans who left high school before graduating to join the
military.
</P>
<P>
   The bill already passed the Senate, but must head back to that
chamber for a vote because of a change made by the House. Gov. John
G. Rowland has said he would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be comforting to have the diploma,'' said Hudson C.
Pelton, of Old Saybrook, whose 13-year-old granddaughter lobbied
for the bill. ''There wasn't time for it after I got out of the
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelton, 75, left high school and joined the Navy in 1942, when
he was 17. He saw action in both the Atlantic and Pacific during
four years of service before returning home to a job and a family
of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, any veteran honorably discharged after at least
90 days of service would be eligible to receive a diploma. The time
of service is shortened if a veteran was discharged for an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Local school boards would be empowered to hand out the diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is recognizing the civics course that they saw and lived
first hand,'' said Rep. Mary Ann Carson, R-New Fairfield, whose
father was a World War II veteran.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 World War II veterans live in Connecticut. Sen.
Thomas Gaffey, the bill's chief sponsor, did not know how many
would be affected by the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Pelton's granddaughter, Colleen Fenn, wrote letters to dozens of
state officials in seeking passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Pelton, who worked 40 years in a Hartford foundry, said his lack
of a diploma didn't keep him from making a living, but was an
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''When somebody asks you about it, it's kind of awkward,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pelton recalled, he didn't think twice about leaving
school for the service.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States was being threatened and England was in
trouble so there was just reason (to enlist),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gaffey, who received one of Fenn's letters, said the bill is
about ''setting things right.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a matter of dignity,'' the Meriden Democrat said. ''It's
a simple gesture we as a state can accord our veterans.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoreans Protest Dollar Economy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Hundreds of demonstrators lobbed rocks at
police and hijacked public buses Wednesday during protests against
rising costs to consumers associated with the nation's plan to
switch to an all-U.S. dollar economy.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 students were arrested in the capital, Quito, after
some 200 protesters threw rocks at riot police, who dispersed the
crowd with tear gas. In another part of the city, more than 300
protesters armed with rocks forced passengers off 13 public buses
and made the drivers abandon their usual routes and pull onto the
campus of the Central University.
</P>
<P>
   There were no serious injuries reported.
</P>
<P>
   The scattered protests in Quito and other major cities were
organized by the leftist-led Patriotic Front -- a coalition of
unions, student groups and grassroots organizations.
</P>
<P>
   President Gustavo Noboa last month approved a far reaching
reform package, paving the way to eliminate the national currency,
the sucre, and replace it with the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   International lenders have backed the plan, and last month
announced a three-year $2 billion aid package to help finance the
rebuilding of Ecuador's shattered economy.
</P>
<P>
   But a condition for the aid includes a phasing out of government
subsidies, which has already caused a doubling of fares for public
transportation and is expected to significantly increase the cost
of home cooking fuel, gasoline and other consumer items.

Columbine Tapes Released to Public
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities released videotapes today offering the
public the first glimpse of Columbine High School's library at least a day after
two students killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher before committing suicide on
April 20, 1999. Ten of those students and the gunmen died in the library.
Authorities charged $25 for each tape. The tape, part of it set to a pop music
soundtrack that was added when it was turned into a training video, was mostly
shot by firefighters. Though six victims' relatives had sued to gain access to
the tapes, many Columbine families had hoped the tapes would not be released to
the public as well.

father asked the court to reject a bid by the boy's great-uncle and former
temporary guardian, Lazaro Gonzalez, to have his lawyers and doctors see the
Cuban refugee and speak for him before the court. The Justice Department also
opposed Lazaro's motion for a court-appointed guardian to examine and speak for
Elian.

Some Drug Prices Outpace Inflation

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices for drugs that older Americans use most often

prescription drug coverage to Medicare. Clinton and Democratic congressional
leaders released the report at the White House to highlight soaring drug prices
and call on Congress to pass legislation giving all Medicare beneficiaries
coverage for their medicines -- an idea opposed by Republicans, who say aid
should go to the neediest seniors.

Ukraine Marks Chernobyl Anniversary

<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukrainians on Wednesday marked the Chernobyl nuclear
disaster with a degree of openness that contrasted sharply with the secrecy that
once surrounded it. When a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded
and caught fire April 26, 1986, in the world's worst nuclear accident, it was at
first a nearly invisible tragedy. Soviet authorities tried to keep the accident
under wraps and its deadly consequences -- radiation -- could not be seen with
the eye. But the aftereffects are grimly visible: an estimated 4,000 deaths
among those who took part in the hasty and poorly organized cleanup; 70,000
people disabled by radiation, according to government figures.

Shooting Suspect Faces Adult Charges

the National Zoo will be charged as an adult. Antoine Bernard Jones, who police
say is the son of a convicted drug enforcer, is charged with assault with intent
to commit murder while armed in the shooting of an 11-year-old boy. The boy, who
remains in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head, was wounded when
Jones allegedly opened fire on a group of young people outside the zoo Monday,
police said. Police have said the shooting stemmed from a quarrel between two
groups of youths.

UN To Patrol Lebanon-Israel Border

   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanon said Wednesday it did not fear chaos and
instability at the southern border after Israeli troops withdraw because U.N.
peacekeepers would help fill the power vacuum. When Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak first announced in March he was pulling his army out of southern Lebanon,
Beirut expressed fears the withdrawal would lead to violence along the border.
Lebanon feared guerrillas would move into the border strip, and Israel warned it
would react with strong force to any cross-border attacks into the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> La. Ends Private Juvenile Facilities  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN CLENDENNING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A private juvenile prison criticized by
federal officials for inhumane conditions will be converted into a
lockup for adult convicts, the prison's owner said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The move marks ''the end of the experimentation with
privatization of the juvenile facilities in Louisiana,'' said David
Utter, director of the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana, an
inmate advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The Jena Juvenile Justice Center opened in December 1998 but was
rocked by allegations in a U.S. Justice Department report issued in
February that painted a picture of an extremely dangerous
environment for inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The state's only other privately owned juvenile prison in
Tallulah was taken over permanently by the state last September
after some guards abandoned their posts in an apparent protest over
low pay.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Edwin Edwards started the process of privatizing new
juvenile prisons, but Gov. Mike Foster declared the experiment a
failure because the prisons were dogged by allegations of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Wackenhut Corrections Corp. made the decision three weeks after
the state took over management of Jena amid accusations guards
habitually used excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reluctantly concluded that it would be in everyone's
best interest for Wackenhut to seek an alternative use for the
facility,'' said George Zoley, chief executive of the Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla.-based company.

<HEADLINE> DC Shooting Suspect Charged As Adult  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 16-year-old boy accused of shooting seven
children at the National Zoo was charged Wednesday as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Bernard Jones, who police say is the son of a convicted
drug enforcer, is charged with assault with intent to commit murder
while armed in the shooting of an 11-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who remains in critical condition with a gunshot wound
to the head, was wounded when Jones allegedly opened fire on a
group of young people outside the zoo Monday, police said. Police
have said the shooting stemmed from a quarrel between two groups of
youths.
</P>
<P>
   Six other children between 12 and 16 years old were also hurt
but they were all treated and released from hospitals. Jones, who
was arrested Tuesday, will probably face other charges, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   At his arraignment Wednesday, Jones was ordered held without
bond pending a May 12 preliminary hearing. If convicted, Jones
faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''This 16-year-old acted alone out of anger,'' said Terrance W.
Gainer, the Metropolitan Police Department's executive assistant
police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' attorney, Renee Raymond, refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Jones is the son of 44-year-old James Antonio Jones,
who once was an enforcer for the Rayful Edmond drug ring. Officials
said it used to be the largest drug enterprise in the city's
history, bringing as much as 1,700 pounds of cocaine into
Washington a month.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Jones was sentenced to 29 years in prison after a 1990
drug conspiracy conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Gainer said police know where Jones threw the 9 mm handgun they
believe was used in the shootings but the weapon has not been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The quick arrest and Wednesday's reopening of the zoo helped
restore calm to the area. ''I think it's been taken care of. And
I'm not afraid,'' said Faye Griffith, who jogs regularly on the
landscaped grounds of the 163-acre facility.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging problems with youth and gun violence, Mayor
Anthony Williams says Washington a safe city with a declining crime
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The city's homicide rate was down nearly 8 percent through the
end of March, and the overall serious crimes including robberies,
assaults, and arsons were down 13.5 percent during the same period,
police records show.

<HEADLINE> Mother of Slain Sergeant Files Claim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The mother of a black police sergeant
shot to death by two white officers filed a $20 million claim
against the city Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he were white, he'd be alive. It's not a very difficult
question to answer for me,'' said attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr., who
is representing Leisa Young, the mother of slain Sgt. Cornel Young
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   A state grand jury last week decided not to indict the two
officers who killed Young.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 29, was off duty and in street clothes when Officers
Carlos Saraiva, 30, and Michael Solitro, 33, mistook him for an
armed suspect in a violent fight and shot him. The officers'
defenders blamed inexperience for the Jan. 28 shooting, since
Solitro had been on patrol just seven nights. Saraiva was on the
force three years.
</P>
<P>
   Leisa Young is divorced from her son's father, Maj. Cornel Young
Sr., the highest-ranking black on the Providence force. Maj. Young
is not involved in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Vincent Cianci Jr. said he respected Leisa Young's right
to sue but rejected any criticism of the police.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think lawsuits if they're kept in the realm of legalities
and kept in the courtroom, they can be productive,'' Cianci said.

<HEADLINE> Tricon Reports Higher Earnings  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SCHREINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Fast-food giant Tricon Global Restaurants
reported a 28 percent gain in first-quarter earnings Wednesday as
overseas sales surged and its pizza business surpassed
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The parent of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC had operating
earnings of $96 million, or 64 cents per share, for the quarter
ending March 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're off to a solid start and we want to keep it going,''
said David C. Novak, Tricon's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had projected first-quarter earnings would amount to 55
cents per share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a gangbuster quarter,'' said Tony Howard, restaurant
analyst with Hilliard Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits were up 33 percent in Tricon's international
business, which accounts for more than one-third of the company's
sales.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, Pizza Hut delivered better-than-expected
results. Sales at Tricon-owned stores open at least a year were 2
percent shy of last year, when sales soared 14 percent on the
successful introduction of The Big New Yorker pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very pleased with Pizza Hut's strong sales and we are
optimistic it is well positioned to have a better-than-expected
2000,'' Novak said.
</P>
<P>
   Same-store sales at Taco Bell were slightly above last year's
first-quarter performance, the company said. At KFC, same-store
sales for the first quarter were down 3 percent from its
strongest-ever quarter in 1999. Sales from KFC's chicken sandwiches
continued to produce about $130,000 in average annualized sales for
each restaurant, above the $100,000 the company had expected when
the sandwich line was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Tricon said it refranchised 183 restaurants during the quarter.
The company also invested more than $135 million to buy back 3.9
million of its shares as part of a $350 million share repurchase
effort announced last September. Since the share repurchase began,
Tricon has invested more than $270 million in buying back 7.2
million of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville-based Tricon's stock was up $1.18} at $34.43}
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Canada Denounces Execution in Vietnam
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Canada has fiercely denounced the execution of a
Canadian citizen convicted in Vietnam of smuggling heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy expressed shock
Wednesday at the unexpected execution of Nguyen Thi Hiep, who was
found with 5.4 kilograms of heroin in her luggage at a Hanoi
airport in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, 43, was executed by firing squad early Monday at a Hanoi
jail.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Vietnam but became a Canadian citizen after
moving to Canada and settling in Montreal in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Toronto police forwarded extensive written and
audio information to Vietnamese authorities suggesting that Nguyen
''may have been duped into transporting drugs out of Vietnam,''
according to Raymond Chan, secretary of state for Asia-Pacific
relations.

Nova Scotia Tory President Quits
</P>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- The knocks against Joe Clark's
leadership of the federal Progressive Conservative party keep
coming.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Nova Scotia's Conservative party resigned
Wednesday to help organize Tom Long's bid for the Canadian Alliance
leadership, which is expected to become official today.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter of resignation, Tom Jarmyn said the federal party
under Clark's leadership has tried to be all things to all people,
adding that the only way to defeat the Chretien Liberals is to
build a broad-based conservative coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Jarmyn's criticism came on the heels of another blow to the
federal Tories: Tuesday's resignation of party whip Andre Harvey,
who has represented Quebec's Saguenay region for three terms.

Ontario Students To Sing National Anthem
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Pledging allegiance to the Queen will soon become
a daily ritual for every student in Ontario, a move not even avowed
monarchists are sure they like.
</P>
<P>
   Come September, students will have to recite the Oath of
Citizenship as part of a proposed code of conduct that includes
daily singing of O Canada, Education Minister Janet Ecker announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an important symbol that shows respect for our country,''
said Ecker, who was unable to recite by heart what she repeatedly
referred to as the citizenship pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchist League of Canada, which fought for years to keep
the Queen in the pledge, believes Ecker's intentions are good but
doesn't favor making the oath part of a daily school ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Manners, president of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers
Federation, is also unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Singing O Canada and reciting a pledge of citizenship that
even the minister doesn't know is hardly a solution to safer
schools,'' he said.
</P>

Demonstrations in Halifax Against Education Budget Cuts
</P>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Students continued to pour out of
Nova Scotia classrooms Wednesday to protest a $20-million cut to
education, defying pleas from teachers and school boards to stay in
school.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined in their defiance of the Conservative
government's cost-cutting budget by parents, teachers, nurses and
transportation workers at a noisy demonstration in front of the
legislature, which peaked at more than 3,000 late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Tory budget promises to cut 1,600 public-service jobs,
including 400 teachers.

<HEADLINE> Slain Teens Buried in N.M.  </HEADLINE>
By PETE HERRERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA VILLITA, N.M. (AP) -- Two high school sweethearts who were
killed while making a Good Friday pilgrimage were buried
side-by-side Wednesday next to a small grove of cottonwood trees.
</P>
<P>
   Green and yellow balloons floated into the cloud-free sky as the
blue and cream-colored caskets were lowered simultaneously into
adjacent graves in the small cemetery in Ricky Martinez's hometown
of La Villita.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez and Karen Castanon, both 17, were shot to death before
dawn Friday as they walked to the Santuario de Chimayo,
participants in an annual pilgrimage that draws thousands to the
church in the small northern New Mexico village of Chimayo. The
church has a small hole in the floor exposing dirt that the
faithful believe has healing powers.
</P>
<P>
   Amid cries of ''We love you Ricky and Karen,'' relatives,
friends and classmates gave a heart-wrenching, tearful farewell to
the two Los Alamos High School juniors.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's body was found by another pilgrim along a road
leading to the church. Hours later, Castanon's body was found in a
remote hilly area. Both had been shot and left to bleed to death,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't make any sense out of it. I can never imagine how this
could ever happen to them,'' said Justin Hogan, a classmate of the
victims who attended the services Wednesday. ''They were two great
people, school-spirited and everything. They were friends with
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   While Martinez and Castanon were being buried, the man accused
of killing them marked his 20th birthday in jail. Carlos Herrera,
arrested early Sunday in the neighboring village of Alcalde, is
charged with murder and kidnapping. He is being held without bond.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not offered a motive for the killings other than to
say it did not appear to be robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral Mass was held at St. John The Baptist Catholic
Church, where Martinez was to have portrayed Jesus Christ during a
religious service on Good Friday evening. Good Friday commemorates
the sentencing and crucifixion of Christ.

<HEADLINE> US Couple Eyes Canada Refugee Status  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Aisha and David Taylor are battling to do
something rare for U.S. citizens -- obtain refugee status in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Turned down by the Canadian Immigration Refugee Board, the black
couple now wants to appeal the rejection to a federal court. If the
appeal fails -- as more than 99 percent do -- they would have to
return to the United States, where they say they have been harassed
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here for political reasons,'' David Taylor, 41, said
Tuesday. ''We were persecuted for our political beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 200 applications by U.S. citizens for so-called
convention refugee status in Canada from 1995 to 1999, only one was
approved, said Paul Hardy, a spokesman for the Immigration Refugee
Board.
</P>
<P>
   The Taylors say they qualify because of FBI harassment under a
government program against black activism, known as COINTELPRO. The
Taylors claimed that the program was directed against black
activists in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the program was dismantled in 1971 but the
Taylors say it continued operating and targeted them after Aisha
led a successful challenge against the Charlottesville, Va., school
system's treatment of black students in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed in 4,000 pages of documents filed with their appeal
that the FBI tapped their phones, intercepted calls, stole their
mail and planted surveillance devices in their home.
</P>
<P>
   They say such harassment deprived them of a ''normal life'' in
the United States, making them eligible to seek convention refugee
status in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Johlie, an FBI spokeswoman in Richmond, said Wednesday she
was unaware of any FBI records involving the Taylors.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Immigration Refugee Board rejected the Taylors'
application for refugee status because of a lack of evidence. The
couple can remain in Canada until all appeals have been exhausted.

   WESTBROOK, Conn. (AP) -- A woman was killed and nine people
injured in a chain reaction crash on Interstate 95 that backed up
traffic for miles Wednesday afternoon, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   The five-vehicle accident occurred at about 2:22 p.m. between
exits 63 and 64 northbound when a Massachusetts Army Reserve truck
lost control, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who was killed was a passenger in one of the cars,
police said. Her identity was not released Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   One victim was listed in critical condition at Yale-New Haven
Hospital, a spokeswoman said. Four of the injured were in fair
condition at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London, said
spokesman Kelly Anthony. Two were treated and released from the
Middlesex Hospital Shoreline clinic in Essex. The conditions of the
other victims were not available Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The northbound section of the highway was shut for several hours
before it reopened at about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Bush Says He Would Restore Civility  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush, addressing Washington's
Republican elite at a record-breaking fund-raiser, promised
Wednesday to reach across party lines and end a ''cycle of
bitterness, an arms race of anger'' that stymies progress in the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   On his first trip to Washington since sealing the Republican
presidential nomination, the Texas governor said ''both parties
bear some of the blame'' for excessive partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will set a different tone in Washington, D.C. I will restore
civility and respect to our national politics,'' he said in a
keynote speech.
</P>
<P>
   The audience included the GOP's top politicians, operatives and
donors -- most of whom understood Bush's critique of both parties as
an appeal to independent-minded voters who tell pollsters they are
tired of partisan bickering.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 1,500 fell silent when Bush said both parties are
to blame for partisan mudslinging and gave him his loudest applause
when he promised to ''respond aggressively'' when attacked by
Democratic rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he promised a more civil discourse, Bush offered
full-throated criticism of Gore, accusing the vice president of
running a negative political operation. ''For Al Gore's campaign,
every day is scorched-earth day,'' Bush said. ''It's time to clean
up the toxic environment in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the keynote speaker at a GOP gala that organizers
announced had raised $21.5 million for the Republican Party, a
record for political fund-raisers. Bush has raised more than $80
million for his own campaign, a record in itself.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner's guest list included many officials from major
companies doing business with the government. Nearly 40 companies
or individuals raised or donated at least $250,000 for the gala,
and an additional 16 contributed at least $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Though campaigning as a political outsider, the Texan and his
aides took advantage of the trip to strengthen their bonds to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Strategist Karl Rove, top fund-raiser Don Evans, campaign
manager Joe Allbaugh and communications director Karen Hughes met
or planned to meet with party officials in Washington this week.
They were discussing how to blend operations of the campaign and
the Republican National Committee, as well as how to gather advice
from top Washington Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was leaving town Thursday morning but his team planned to
remain in Washington through Saturday for a series of meetings,
including their first major strategy session for the Republican
National Convention in August. Bush is still without a convention
chairman, a key slot he hopes to fill soon.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself met Wednesday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov to discuss U.S.-Russian relations. The Texan's grasp of
foreign affairs has been a question mark over the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also met privately with Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey
of Nebraska to discuss Social Security reform. The meeting was
meant to symbolize Bush's commitment to bipartisanship; Texas
Democrats favoring Bush over Gore accompanied the governor on a
campaign trip this week.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, Nebraska chairman of Gore's campaign, said he believed
both Bush and Gore were capable of working with lawmakers in both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think either one of them understand that you're going to
have a closely divided House and Senate, regardless of what happens
in the general election,'' Kerrey told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Americans crave bipartisanship after ''eight years of
excessive partisanship and finger pointing, eight years of attempts
to exploit fear and foster division, all to score political
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Laying most of the blame on Democrats, he said, ''The
Clinton-Gore administration has been the most relentlessly partisan
administration in our nation's history, but sometimes some in our
party have responded in kind. Americans have seen a cycle of
bitterness, an arms race of anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said donors at the dinner, including
the National Rifle Association and tobacco companies, ''have been
the biggest impediments, obstacles and walls to real reform in this
country. For him to preach nonpartisanship is sort of like talking
about tolerance and then going to Bob Jones University.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the South Carolina university have criticized
interracial dating and the Catholic Church. Bush spoke at the
university during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Bush calling Gore a negative campaigner, the vice
president's team fired off a list of examples of Bush criticizing
Gore in highly personal terms.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the back-and-forth, Bush promised a more civil approach as
president. Bill Clinton in 1992, campaigning for his first term in
office, made the same promise as a southern governor trying to
become president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will treat the other party with respect and when we make
progress for the American people, I will be willing to share the
credit,'' he told the GOP crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Before the fund-raiser, Doris Haddock, the 90-year-old New
Hampshire woman who walked cross-country to promote campaign
finance reform, was turned away for trying to attend without a
ticket. She wanted to speak with Bush, who opposes most proposed
campaign finance changes.

<HEADLINE> Jackson confronts Klan in Wallingford  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson confronted a
group of white supremacists at a downtown rally Wednesday, as he
applauded a new law that forces the town to observe Martin Luther
King Day along with the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Wallingford is the only town in Connecticut that keeps its
offices open on King Day. A state law signed Wednesday requires all
municipalities to observe the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 people waving Confederate flags protested Jackson's
visit and shouted at Jackson through a bullhorn as he preached at a
downtown church.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson offered to shake hands and tried to peek under the face
mask of one man who was dressed in Ku Klux Klan garb, but he was
rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for sheets to be worn on a bed and not to hide a
person's face,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the Klan robe with the frayed hem said he was not
preaching hate but wanted to demonstrate pride in his white race.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Jackson of not standing up for white people who have
been killed by blacks in Africa and in American cities.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters refused to give their names, saying they feared
reprisals on the job, in the media and in the community.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 people, including many residents of Wallingford of all
races, came out to support Jackson with a candlelight march and
rally from the church to town hall in the drizzling, cold rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is good to see the real Wallingford stand up,'' Jackson
told the crowd inside St. Paul's Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   Many shouted ''Jesse!'' above the bullhorn-amplified shouts of
the white supremacists at the town hall rally. Others, including
Candy Gehring, waved handwritten placards in protest of the Klan
display.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are disgraced by having this in our town. I'm ashamed to
live here,'' said Gehring, 19.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the steps of town hall, Jackson urged the crowd to
''love people who do not understand and are trapped in fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate gave final legislative approval to the King Day
bill minutes before midnight Tuesday, and Gov. John G. Rowland
signed it Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad this governor signed this bill today to make a
statement for the country and for the world,'' the civil rights
leader said between privately meeting with Rowland and addressing
the state House of Representatives in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Wallingford Mayor William Dickinson has ''slept
through a revolution'' while leading the only town in the state
which has not closed its municipal offices on King Day, despite a
1986 law making it a state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may be looking at a Rip Van Winkle situation where some
people sleep too long,'' Jackson said. ''And while they're asleep,
the world passes them by.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson has said the controversy is not about race, but a
dispute with the town's labor unions. Dickinson wants town workers
to swap another holiday for King Day, but union leaders want
workers to get the day off as an extra paid holiday.
</P>

   Before the Jan. 17 holiday this year, three people wearing Ku
Klux Klan hoods and robes walked along Main Street in Wallingford.
On the holiday, one of those people stood near a church where a
celebration honoring King was being held. Neo-Nazi literature also
has been distributed around the town.

   ''It's important to make bigots feel uncomfortable in

   Pointing to a national report released this week that says
minority youths are treated less fairly than their white peers by
the judicial system, Jackson called for a change in the way young
black and Latino offenders are dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   He said improved education in communities and prisons will
reduce criminal recidivism rates among juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now they leave jail sicker and slicker and return to jail
quicker,'' Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Confronts Klan in Conn.  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson confronted a
group of white supremacists here Wednesday after applauding
lawmakers and the governor for passing a law that forces the town
to close its offices on Martin Luther King Day.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was in Wallingford for a rally in support of the
legislation that will require all municipalities in Connecticut to
recognize the holiday. Wallingford is the only town in the state
that keeps its offices open on King Day.
</P>
<P>
   A group of about 10 people waving Confederate flags showed up to
protest Jackson's visit. Jackson offered to shake the hand of one
man who was dressed in Ku Klux Klan garb, but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for sheets to be worn on a bed and not to hide a
person's face,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation occurred before Jackson attended a church
service and led a march of over 500 people to town hall for a rally
supporting the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is good to see the real Wallingford stand up,'' Jackson
told the crowd inside St. Paul's Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   As the group marched through town, the white supremacists
marched beside them shouting taunts.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate gave final approval to the King Day bill late
Tuesday, and Gov. John Rowland signed it Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to make bigots feel uncomfortable in
Wallingford and everywhere else,'' said Democratic state Rep. Mary
Mushinsky. ''And its' important that my hometown Wallingford
reiterates that we are a town that thrives on diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallingford Mayor William Dickinson has said the controversy is
not about race, but a dispute with the town's labor unions. He
wants town workers to swap another holiday for King Day, but union
leaders want workers to get the day off as an extra paid holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson did not return telephone calls seeking comment
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> NH Gets Female Supreme Court Justice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The state's first female governor on
Wednesday swore in its first female Supreme Court justice, making
New Hampshire the 49th state to name a woman to its high court.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeanne Shaheen swore in Linda Dalianis during a crowded
Statehouse reception.
</P>
<P>
   Dalianis, 51, of Nashua, was named Superior Court chief justice
just one month ago, and her promotion comes at a difficult time for
the Supreme Court. She will replace former Justice Stephen Thayer,
who resigned on March 31 rather than face prosecution for allegedly
trying to influence his own divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Legislature is investigating whether other
justices committed impeachable ethics violations.
</P>
<P>
   ''She brings an incredible amount of integrity, fairness and
understanding of the process,'' Shaheen said. ''I'm glad I was
governor at a time when I had the opportunity to appoint the first
woman to the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalianis said she must help restore public confidence in the
court.
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota is the only state yet to name a woman to its high
court.

Elian Doc: No Miami Visitors Yet
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A child psychiatrist who interviewed Elian Gonzalez for
the government urged today against a visit by his Miami relatives ''in their
current angry state.'' The 6-year-old Cuban refugee's father, meanwhile, asked a
federal court to allow him alone to speak for his son. Noting the anger
expressed by the Miami relatives over the raid that took Elian from them
Saturday, Dr. Paulina Kernberg said, ''In that frame of mind, they would likely
be disruptive for the child, who demands a quiet period of emotional healing
from the last few weeks of stress.'' She recommended the Miami relatives seek
counseling ''to aid them in accepting and supporting Elian's reunion with his
father.''

Columbine Tapes Made Public
</SUBHEAD>

   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Authorities released videotapes today offering the
public the first glimpse of Columbine High School's library at least a day after
two students killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher before committing suicide on
April 20, 1999. Ten of those students and the gunmen died in the library.
Authorities charged $25 for each tape. The tape, part of it set to a pop music
soundtrack that was added when it was turned into a training video, was mostly
shot by firefighters. Though six victims' relatives had sued to gain access to
the tapes, many Columbine families had hoped the tapes would not be released to
the public as well.

   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Gov. Howard Dean today signed a first-in-the-nation
law that grants gay couples nearly all of the benefits of marriage. The state
law will allow gay couples to form civil unions beginning July 1. That will
entitle them to all of the 300 or so rights and responsibilities available to
married couples under Vermont law in such areas as taxes, inheritance and
medical decision-making. No state has gone further than Vermont is giving gay
couples something approximating marriage. The bill came about after the Vermont
Supreme Court unanimously ruled in December that gay couples were being
unconstitutionally denied the benefits of marriage.

Ukraine Marks Chernobyl Anniversary

   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukrainians on Wednesday marked the Chernobyl nuclear
disaster with a degree of openness that contrasted sharply with the secrecy that
once surrounded it. When a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded
and caught fire April 26, 1986, in the world's worst nuclear accident, it was at
first a nearly invisible tragedy. Soviet authorities tried to keep the accident
under wraps and its deadly consequences -- radiation -- could not be seen with
the eye. But the aftereffects are grimly visible: an estimated 4,000 deaths
among those who took part in the hasty and poorly organized cleanup; 70,000
people disabled by radiation, according to government figures.

<HEADLINE> After Arrest, Coach Backs Marinovich  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Quarterback Todd Marinovich is expected to
practice with the Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football League
Thursday, two days after being arrested for investigation of
sexually assaulting a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Todd has been, is now and will be part of this football
team,'' Avengers coach Stan Brock said Wednesday during a news
conference at the team's West Los Angeles training facility. ''In
respect to the law, we have to let it run its course.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich is scheduled to attend Thursday morning's
quarterbacks meeting and team practice, Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers were not scheduled to practice Wednesday, and their
next game is Monday against Oklahoma at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Brock said he has not talked with Marinovich since the
quarterback was asked to leave the practice field by Los Angeles
County sheriff's deputies just before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I'm concerned, people are innocent until proven
guilty,'' Brock said. ''I'm not going to jump to any conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   The alleged attack occurred shortly after midnight Tuesday at
Marinovich's Marina del Rey apartment, said sheriff's Sgt. Norine
Plett.
</P>
<P>
   Plett said that Marinovich's arrest was based on the woman's
statements and evidence of a physical examination she had at a
hospital after the alleged attack.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich was released on $50,000 bail at about 12:15 a.m.
Wednesday, Sgt. George Ducoulombier said. Arraignment is scheduled
May 16 in Culver City Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich, 30, is the Avengers' second-string quarterback. He
did not play in either of their first two regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich was the University of Southern California quarterback
as a redshirt freshman on the Trojans' 1990 Rose Bowl champion
team. He left school following his sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Raiders made Marinovich their first-round choice
in the 1991 NFL draft, but released him before the 1993 season.
Marinovich acknowledged drug use was a major factor. In 1998, he
served three months in jail after pleading guilty to growing
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   He has not played an official game since 1992. He injured a knee
in training camp with the Canadian Football League's Winnipeg Blue
Bombers in 1994 and was out of football from then until last year,
when he signed with the CFLs British Columbia Lions.

<HEADLINE> Castro Lashes Out at U.S. Officials  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro on Wednesday lashed out at
U.S. officials for not authorizing Cuban child specialists to visit
the 6-year-old in preparation for his possible return to the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said that Washington's refusal to permit the full
31-member delegation proposed by Cuba ''cannot be explained.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a single specialist, not a single psychologist, not a
single psychiatrist,'' have been approved by U.S. officials, Castro
told reporters after visiting a special boarding school in Havana
being prepared for Elian and his classmates to attend if the boy is
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Castro also repeated his praise of the raid that removed Elian
from the house of Miami relatives, but he said that in Cuba such an
action would have been handled without weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do it with unarmed people,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said weapons were used to safeguard
the lives of agents due to reports of possible arms at the Miami
house.
</P>
<P>
   Castro spent a few minutes touring the converted house where
Cuban officials say Elian will stay if a federal court allows him
to leave the United States, where he has been since being rescued
after a shipwreck that killed his mother in late November.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Elian's former kindergarten teacher Agueda Fleitas
and cousin Yasmany Betancourt were flying to Washington, carrying
school materials, gifts and mementos for the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Elian's schoolmates and four of their parents applied
Wednesday for visas to visit the United States as well. U.S.
officials have said the visas will be expedited.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am going to give him a kiss and a very strong hug,''
10-year-old Yasmany said in an interview broadcast by Cuban state
television Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba had asked U.S. officials for permission to send a much
larger delegation including 12 schoolchildren, three teachers, five
psychologists or psychiatrists and six doctors.
</P>
<P>
   University of Havana psychologist Aurora Garcia, a proposed
member of the group, said the idea is to help the boy ''restore his
historical memory,'' cure psychological wounds caused the stress of
recent months and prepare him for return to his Cuban friends.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Expects Quick Vote Results  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori said Wednesday that
speedy returns in a clean and open runoff election will lay to rest
international concerns about the fairness of Peru's presidential
vote.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Tuesday signed a congressional resolution
warning Fujimori that economic and diplomatic relations with
between the two nations could suffer if the Peruvian government
does not respect democratic processes in the upcoming ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said he was not concerned by Clinton's message because
his government was striving to provide the free and fair elections
sought by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori will face economist Alejandro Toledo in a second round
showdown in late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the first round there were accusations that caused damage
to the image of Peru. Of that there is no doubt,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori fell just shy of the majority he needed for a first
round victory in an April 9 election so riddled with irregularities
and accusations of fraud that much of the international community
all but insisted on a second round.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials took three days to tally enough votes to
determine that Fujimori had fallen short of an unprecedented third
term. The delay increased suspicions of election rigging, which
Fujimori has denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the second round, with results that we expect will come in
much more quickly, we will be able to recuperate Peru's good
image,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has accused Fujimori and his supporters of dragging their
feet on a proposed pact to conduct a clean runoff election.

<HEADLINE> Broadway Producer Merrick Dies  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA, AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Broadway producer David Merrick, whose savvy
sense of show business and popular taste helped create such
enduring musical hits as ''Gypsy,'' ''Hello, Dolly!'' and ''42nd
Street,'' has died at age 88.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick, who died Tuesday in London, had been ill for some time,
having suffered a stroke in 1983 that left him severely disabled
and forced him to use a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick dominated New York theater in Broadway's Golden Age
after World War II, producing more than 80 shows including
''Oliver!,'' ''Carnival,'' ''Fanny,'' ''Look Back in Anger,''
''Becket,'' ''Irma La Douce,'' ''Play It Again, Sam,'' ''A Taste of
Honey,'' ''Stop the World -- I Want to Get Off,'' ''Cactus Flower,''
''Philadelphia, Here I Come,'' ''Forty Carats,'' ''I Do! I Do!''
and ''Promises, Promises.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved the man, and he certainly knew how to handle
publicity,'' Carol Channing, the original star of ''Hello,
Dolly!'', said Wednesday. ''I always called him 'Mr. Merrick.' I
couldn't call him 'David.' I had too much respect for his
showmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   That showmanship was the stuff of Broadway legend, stunts that
often outraged critics but brought people to the box office for his
plays and musicals.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most famous involved the musical ''Subways Are for
Sleeping,'' which received tepid notices from the critics.
Undeterred, Merrick took a newspaper ad with rave quotes from seven
men who just happened to have the same names as the critics for New
York's seven daily newspapers. The ad ran in one edition of the New
York Herald-Tribune before it was noticed -- and then yanked.
</P>
<P>
   ''He couldn't care less what was said about him, as long as his
shows were mentioned,'' recalled Lee Solters, a veteran press agent
who was with Merrick from his first musical hit, ''Fanny,'' in
1954.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews for ''Fanny,'' which starred Ezio Pinza, Walter
Slezak and newcomer Florence Henderson, were largely negative. Yet
the producer got a two-year run out of the show through heavy
advertising -- in such faraway places as the French Riviera -- and a
series of stunts that kept it in the news. Among his gimmicks: He
placed a life-size nude statue of the musical's belly dancer in
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick was a master at extending the lives of his productions
through big-name casting, too. He was one of the first producers to
use stars to replace stars. With ''Hello, Dolly!'', he had a
succession of famous Dollys follow Channing in the title role,
including Ginger Rogers, Martha Raye, Betty Grable, Pearl Bailey,
Phyllis Diller and Ethel Merman, who closed the show after a run of
2,844 performances.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s and 1960s, the producer reportedly grossed $20
million annually, earning $2 million a year from his hits. His
productions have won countless Tony Awards -- ''Hello, Dolly!''
alone picked up 10 Tonys in 1964 -- as well as other theater prizes
including the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award and London's
Olivier Award.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dolly'' was one of the producer's biggest triumphs. It was
based on Thornton Wilder's ''The Matchmaker,'' which Merrick had
produced successfully on Broadway nearly 10 years earlier with Ruth
Gordon as Dolly Levi.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick was not above bringing culture and serious drama to
Broadway either, particularly the work of British playwrights. He
imported plays by John Osborne, Tom Stoppard, Shelagh Delaney and
Joe Orton, as well as Irish author Brian Friel.
</P>
<P>
   His flops were well-known, too, particularly ''Breakfast at
Tiffany's,'' which never officially opened in New York despite the
potent box-office draw of two television stars, Mary Tyler Moore
and Richard Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, despite his infirmities, Merrick invested heavily
in the 1996 musical ''State Fair,'' based on the 1945 and 1962
films of that name. It also failed to make any money.
</P>
<P>
   Born in St. Louis, Merrick attended Washington University and
later St. Louis University, where he majored in law. In 1946, he
became general manager for director and producer Herman Shumlin.
Three years later, Merrick produced his first play,
''Clutterbuck,'' which closed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick's private life was as stormy as his public one. He had
five wives and six marriages. He was married to wife No. 3, Etan,
twice, and the couple frequently battled in court over their
divorce proceedings. His fourth wife was Karen Prunczik, who played
Anytime Annie in the original company of ''42nd Street.'' In 1989,
Natalie Lloyd, his lawyer's receptionist, became his live-in
companion. They were married last November.
</P>
<P>
   One of Merrick's most dramatic successes, ''42nd Street,''
occurred late in his producing career. Adapted from the 1933 Ruby
Keeler movie, the musical had a run of more than eight years, the
longest of any Merrick show. It was directed by Gower Champion, who
died of a rare blood cancer hours before the New York opening in
August 1980. Merrick announced Champion's death to a stunned
opening-night audience immediately after the curtain came down.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Merrick is survived by two daughters
from previous marriages, Cecilia Anne of Mullica Hill, N.J., and
Marguerite of New York.

<HEADLINE> Bill To Give Vets Diplomas Advanced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- State lawmakers unanimously passed a bill
Wednesday that would grant diplomas to World War II veterans who
left high school to join the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is recognizing the civics course that they saw and lived
first hand,'' said Rep. Mary Ann Carson, R-New Fairfield, whose
father was a World War II veteran.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 World War II veterans live in Connecticut, although
it's unknown how many would be affected by the measure. The bill
would give local school boards the authority to give diplomas to
any veteran honorably discharged after at least 90 days of service,
or less time if the veteran was discharged for an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''There wasn't time for it after I got out of the service,''
said Hudson C. Pelton, who left school to join the Navy in 1942,
when he was 17. ''The United States was being threatened and
England was in trouble so there was just reason (to enlist).''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill passed Wednesday must be reconciled with a Senate
version before being sent to the governor. Gov. John G. Rowland has
said he would sign it.

<HEADLINE> Police: Germaine Greer Held Hostage  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE BYRNE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON, England (AP) -- Feminist Germaine Greer was held hostage
over Easter weekend by a female student who broke into her home,
Essex police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police received a call shortly after 10 p.m. Monday complaining
of an intruder at Greer's isolated mansion in Great Chesterford in
southern England.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Burke, 19, from Bath in southwest England, was arrested at
the mansion and charged with assault and unlawful imprisonment,
said Acting Inspector Bernie Tomsett. She is to appear in court May
4.
</P>
<P>
   Greer was ''badly shaken'' but was not injured during the
incident, Britain's Press Association reported, quoting police
sources.
</P>
<P>
   She was reportedly tied up and her home was vandalized with a
fireplace poker. Police were alerted by Greer's three friends, who
had been invited to dinner and heard shouting from inside the
mansion, Press Association said. Police did not say how long she
was held hostage by her attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, 61, first made headlines in 1970 with her landmark
treatise on feminism, ''The Female Eunuch.'' More recently, she
wrote ''The Whole Woman,'' which deals with the state of the
women's movement.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, an Australian-born professor, was not available for
comment. However, she wrote a column for the The Daily Telegraph
newspaper in which she said she felt uneasy about strangers.

   ''I have no signs saying Private Property or Keep Out or

<HEADLINE> Jagr Again Misses Penguins Practice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANONSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Jaromir Jagr missed his second straight
practice Wednesday because of flulike symptoms, but should be ready
for Pittsburgh's playoff series opener against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr routinely skipped practice at the end of the regular season
after developing several injuries, and the Penguins essentially let
him practice whenever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel good ... a little touch of the flu,'' Jagr said.
''I just don't feel good, but it's getting better. Of course, I
want to play, but if I was a little more healthy it would be a lot
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins clearly need the NHL's scoring champion healthy to
make a run at the Flyers, who have won 16 games in a row against
the Penguins in Philadelphia. The Eastern Conference semifinal
series opens Thursday night in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too bad I couldn't practice,'' Jagr said. ''I wanted to
practice before this series, but I just couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes, things don't go the way you want them to but,
hopefully, it's not going to affect me for long and I can get back
into the shape I want to.''

<HEADLINE> Viacom Reports Pre-Merger Earnings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc., owner of the MTV cable channel and
the Blockbuster video chain, reported a large jump in net earnings
in the latest fiscal quarter, which will likely be its last
reporting period before merging with CBS Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom earned $76 million, or 11 cents per share, in the three
months ended March 31, compared to $44.9 million, or 5 cents a
share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The year-ago results included $23.5 million in expenses relating
to early retirement of debt, without which profits would have been
$68.4 million, or 8 cents a share, making this year's result an
increase of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The per-share earnings of 11 cents far exceeded the 6 cents per
share forecast by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial. The company's stock was priced at $54.56\ at 5:15 p.m.
EST on the New York Stock Exchange, up $2.81\ or more than 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose 2.5 percent to $3.03 billion from $2.95 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings announcement came a week after Federal
Communications Commission staff recommended that the commission
approve Viacom's merger deal with CBS, provided the companies sell
assets to comply with federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would own television stations reaching 41
percent of the national audience, but current rules limit that
amount to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Current FCC rules also prohibit one company from owning two
broadcast networks, a complicating factor for the combined company,
which would own both CBS and UPN. But that rule is currently being
reviewed by the FCC and could be relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, Viacom acquired the 50 percent of UPN that it
didn't already own from Chris-Craft Industries for $5 million,
ending a troubled partnership with the former boat builder-turned
media company.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Justice Department said Wednesday that it won't
seek to block the proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   The department determined after a thorough investigation of the
merger that ''the proposed transaction did not violate the
antitrust laws,'' said Justice spokeswoman Gina Talamona.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom's biggest revenue gains in the quarter came from its
cable networks business, which includes MTV, VH1 and Showtime.
Revenues in that segment rose 14 percent to $760 million.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from entertainment slipped 3 percent as theaters had
lower results because of adding new multiplexes. But earnings from
television stations and syndication of shows such as ''Judge Judy''
were higher.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing revenues slipped 8 percent on lower sales in the
company's Pocket Books division.

<HEADLINE> Korea Officials Meet Before Summit  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) -- North and South Korean officials held a
second round of talks Thursday in preparation for June's first-ever
summit between leaders of the rival nations.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting opened at Unification House, an administrative
building in the northern sector of Panmunjom, a border village
inside the 2{-mile-wide demilitarized zone separating the Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   At the first meeting on the southern side of the village last
Saturday, South Korea presented its proposed agenda and other
details for the June 12-14 summit in the North's capital of
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The summit would be the first between leaders of the Koreas,
which were divided into the communist North and the pro-Western
South in 1945. The two signed no peace treaty at the end of the
1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   For the agenda, South Korea proposed four topics -- economic
cooperation, peace measures, the reunion of separated family
members and the establishment of a permanent government channel of
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea was expected to make its proposals at the second
round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   In previous talks, the North has complained about South Korea's
anti-communist national security law and the presence of 37,000
American troops in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials say the summit between their president,
Kim Dae-jung, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il will be in
jeopardy if North Korea insists that such topics be included in the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The summit comes as the impoverished North Korea has become
increasingly desperate for aid to rebuild its dilapidated economy.
U.N. figures show that the communist country has received more than
dlrs 1.2 billion in emergency outside aid since 1995 to feed its 22
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office more than two years ago, Kim has pushed a
so-called ''sunshine'' policy of engaging North Korea. He believes
the summit is a product of his policy.

<HEADLINE> Amateur astronomers capture rare gamma burst  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH JAVA, N.Y. (AP) -- Two nights on a cold, damp hillside paid
off for four amateur astronomers who succeeded in capturing the
faint afterglow of an explosion in space that occurred billions of
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other astronomers in the world, both professionals,
recorded the gamma ray burst early March 4. The four amateurs were
honored this month by NASA.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was pretty neat,'' Frank Chalupka said of the High Energy
Astrophysics Workshop he attended with the others at NASA's
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. ''Just about
everybody there had a Ph.D. They were calling us '''the Buffalo
group.'''
</P>
<P>
   Chalupka is a technical representative for Simplex Systems in
Williamsville. Two of the others, Dennis Hohman and Bill Aquino,
are technical writers at TX RX Systems in Angola. Tom Bakowski is a
junior at Orchard Park High School.
</P>
<P>
   The group captured the phenomenon using a 12-inch mirror which
reflected the gamma burst into the lens of a homemade digital
camera they had duct-taped to the barrel of their 40-year-old
telescope.
</P>
<P>
   In Huntsville, they were toasted for being the only amateur
astronomers, among 65 or so around the world, who had aimed
telescopes toward the constellation Hercules to capture the
celestial phenomenon. They were among the first amateurs in the
world to record one of these powerful explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Astronomical Association team had been alerted by
Internet postings that spacecraft had detected a gamma ray burst
near Hercules. The group assembled at Beaver Meadow Observatory,
about 35 miles southeast of Buffalo, on the evening of March 3 only
to be thwarted by rain. By 2 a.m. the next day, the sky had cleared
and the telescope was trained on the coordinates supplied by
professional astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   Gamma ray bursts are so faint and fade so quickly they are
extremely difficult to find, even with the largest of telescopes.
Gamma ray burst 00301(C), as this one was called, had a brightness
of the 20th magnitude -- a comparable star would be a million times
dimmer than the dimmest stars visible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   The group focused on the location for two hours and enlisted the
help of Arne Henden, a professional astronomer at the U.S. Naval
Observatory near Flagstaff Ariz., to upload five-minute exposures
into a computer.
</P>
<P>
   To the untrained eye, the pictures despict nothing more than
dark spots on a light background.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're part of the early response network,'' Aquino said. ''Our
job is to find and monitor these events until the big guns can get
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what that night was about -- to see if we could pull it
off,'' Hohman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gamma ray bursts result from explosions of incredible violence,
such as the collision of neutron stars. The first was detected less
than 30 years ago and the first afterglow was recorded by the
Hubble space telescope three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here was an event that occurred in the neighborhood of 12
billion to 15 billion years ago,'' Aquino said. ''When the light
left (the point of impact), the Earth and sun didn't even exist.
They're only 5 billion years old.''

<HEADLINE> Former Black Panther Settles Suit  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Black Panther leader Elmer
''Geronimo'' Pratt has settled his false imprisonment and civil
rights lawsuit against the FBI and city of Los Angeles for $4.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, 53, spent 25 years in prison until his murder conviction
was overturned in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''Geronimo will have money to take care of him for the rest of
his life,'' his attorney, Stuart Hanlon, said Wednesday. ''It's one
of those situations where everyone is happy with the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the settlement said the city's share,
which must be approved by the City Council, is $2.75 million and
that the FBI's share is $1.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles FBI spokeswoman Cheryl Mimura declined comment. The
city attorney's office did not respond to a call for comment on the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, maintained his innocence
from the start. He lives in his hometown of Morgan City, La., where
he uses the name Geronimo ji Jaga.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1972 trial, Pratt was convicted of robbing and fatally
shooting schoolteacher Caroline Olsen on a Santa Monica tennis
court.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was in Oakland for Black Panther meetings the day of
the murder, and that FBI agents and police hid and possibly
destroyed wiretap evidence that would have exonerated him.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt's lawyers blamed his arrest on a politically charged
campaign by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI against the Black Panthers and
other perceived enemies of the U.S. government. His legal team
waged a relentless campaign to free Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Everett Dickey finally granted Pratt a new
trial in 1997, saying the credibility of prosecution witness Julius
Butler -- who testified that Pratt had confessed to him -- could have
been undermined if the jury had known Butler was an ex-felon and
police informant.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt was freed. Two years later, District Attorney Gil Garcetti
announced he would not bring him to trial again after failing to
persuade an appeals court to reinstate the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this means,'' said Hanlon, ''is if you fight hard enough,
have a good legal team and people to back you, you can undo the
injustices of the system.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Group Alleges Trade Conspiracy  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven gun makers and an industry group sued
the Department of Housing and Urban Development and 16 cities
Wednesday over a plan to give preferential treatment to Smith &AMP;
Wesson when buying guns for law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in an Atlanta federal court alleges an illegal
conspiracy in restraint of trade.
</P>
<P>
   In March, President Clinton announced a landmark gun safety
agreement with Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest gun maker. The
plan included the installation of gun locks on all the weapons it
sells, the introduction within three years of ''smart gun''
technology, and barring sales of its weapons at gun shows without a
background check.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Smith &AMP; Wesson was to be dropped from
lawsuits against gun makers that were being contemplated by federal
officials and some cities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Smith &AMP; Wesson, any other gun maker that agreed
to the plan would also be given preferential treatment. Smith &AMP;
Wesson has been the only gun maker to sign onto the agreement thus
far.
</P>
<P>
   ''These local officials have tried everything from litigation to
economic extortion to compel compliance on a national level with
their own individual ideas about gun design, ownership and
distribution,'' said Robert Delfay, president of the National
Shooting Sports Foundation, a gun industry group that is a party in
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names as defendants New York Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer and Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who
helped draw up the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Also named were the California communities of San Francisco,
Berkeley, East Palo Alto, Inglewood, Oakland, and San Mateo; as
well as Bridgeport, Conn.; Atlanta; Miami-Dade County, Fla.; Gary,
Ind.; Boston; Detroit; St. Louis; Newark, N.J.; Philadelphia; and
the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are demanding cities stop the effort of using their
purchasing power to control the distribution and design of
firearms,'' said Jeff Reh, general counsel for Beretta U.S.A. Corp,
one of the seven suing companies.
</P>
<P>
   Reh said the mayors were attempting to expand their authority
beyond their cities. HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo called the lawsuit
''frivolous'' and said it was ''a vain attempt to distract from
their (gun makers') failure to take responsibility for there share
of the tragic problem of gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim called the lawsuit, ''a desperate
move by the gun makers to try and prevent us from doing what is the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They continue to forget that our only goal is to protect
children and families, and their only goal is to protect corporate
profits and greed,'' Ganim said.
</P>
<P>
   Comment on the lawsuit from Capitol Hill was swift and partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am disappointed that some gun manufacturers have chosen
confrontation over cooperation,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J. ''The federal government isn't asking for much, only that
these companies help adopt common sense measures to keep guns from
ending up in the wrong hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he thinks the Clinton
administration overstepped its authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the allegations of the complaint filed today ... it now
appears the administration seeks to further its goals by
circumventing the will of Congress and illegitimately bringing the
weight of the executive branch to bear on law-biding firearm
manufacturers,'' Hatch said.

<HEADLINE> Elian Psychiatrist Report Highlights  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Key points made by Dr. Paulina Kernberg, a
psychiatrist who met
with Elian Gonzalez and his family, in a government filing
Wednesday with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elian and his family:
</P>
<P>
   --''In my judgment, Elian has a relationship with his father that
is characterized by admiration and pride.''
</P>
<P>
   --''Elian appears to feel free to assert himself around his
father, as evidenced by refusing to take his vitamin C pill and
drink all his milk.''
</P>
<P>
   --''Elian carries him around proudly, helps to change his
diapers, caresses him and makes him laugh.'' This a reference to
Elian's infant half brother, Hianny.
</P>
<P>
   --''Elian enjoyed hanging from his father's shoulders or in an
upside-down position or simply cuddling with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian at play:
</P>
<P>
   --''He played tic-tac-toe with his stepmother and hide-and-seek
with her and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   --''He also played with some plastic toy soldiers that I had
brought with me to assess his reaction to their appearance, which
was not unlike that of the officers who had retrieved him from his
Miami relatives' at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian and the raid:
</P>
<P>
   --''I conclude that his removal from his Miami relatives' home
although clearly startling and frightening was in all likelihood
not a traumatic experience producing lasting effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his cousin, Marisleysis, who helped care for him in
Miami:
</P>
<P>
   --''Elian later told his stepmother a ''secret,'' that he has a
secret love, ''Mary.'' In my observations of Elian, there were
indications that ''Mary'' (his cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez) may be
an idealized love, rather than a maternal figure.''
</P>
<P>
   --''His feelings for Marisleysis are similar to the romantic
feelings of a schoolboy for his teacher or a wished-for
girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian and the Miami relatives:
</P>
<P>
   --''I believe that the stressful nature of the last several
months ... (i.e., constant crowds and media access; late hours) may
have exhausted him.''
</P>
<P>
   --''A visit by Elian's Miami relatives would not be advisable in
their current angry state.''
</P>
<P>
   --''They would likely be disruptive for the child, who demands a
quiet period of emotional healing from the last few weeks of
stress.''
</P>
<P>
   --''It is my opinion that Elian would benefit from contact from
his Miami relatives, in the form of letters, photographs, and
cassette tapes with recorded messages.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Nuke Accident Claims 2d Victim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A worker exposed to excessive radiation in Japan's
worst nuclear accident died Thursday morning, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Masato Shinohara, 40, was the second plant worker to die since
the accident on Sept. 30 at a uranium-processing facility in
Tokaimura, 70 miles, northeast of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   NHK television reported that he died after a weakening of his
condition, which was compounded by pneumonia and weakened kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Shinohara had been at the University of Tokyo Hospital since
April 10 after being transferred from another medical facility. He
had been on a respirator since February.
</P>
<P>
   Hisashi Ouchi, 35, died of multiple organ failure on Dec. 21
after having been exposed to a massive amount of radiation. He was
the first person in Japan to die as a result of a nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
   A third worker, Yutaka Yokokawa, was also hospitalized for
exposure to a lesser amount of radiation, but was discharged in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was triggered when the three workers used too much
uranium to make fuel and set off an uncontrolled atomic reaction.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 439 people including nearby residents are believed to
have been exposed to radiation in the accident.

<HEADLINE> Protest cost police, agencies $500,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) -- A three-day protest at a World Bank
conference cost state, county and local police and other agencies
over $500,000, law enforcement officials announced Wednesday. Much
of that is for overtime costs.
</P>
<P>
   The protest, which attracted about 200 demonstrators the weekend
of April 1-2, led to nine arrests for charges including trespassing
and failing to disperse, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something of this financial size is new,'' said Capt.
Christopher Linne of the Morris County prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   The county police chief's group has asked Rep. Rodney
Frelinghuysen, a Republican whose district includes much of Morris
County, to help find compensation, Linne said.
</P>
<P>
   The largest costs were borne by the sheriff's department,
$173,511; Florham Park police, $43,872; and the Morris County
prosecutor's office, $31,325, according to an accounting
distributed by the group.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers had originally told police that at least 500
protestors could be expected at the Hamilton Park Conference Center
in Florham Park.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was sponsored by the World Bank, International
Monetary Fund and the Brookings Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was organized by a coalition of grassroots groups
called the New Jersey/New York Mobilization for Global Justice. The
groups maintained that the World Bank and the IMF, charged with
improving life in developing countries, instead throw the countries
into debt while enriching corporations and degrading the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Police determined that some of the groups planning to attend
participated in the rioting at the World Trade Organization
conference in Seattle in December.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, authorities activated the highest level of the
Morris County Regional Deployment System, drawing personnel from
every police department in the county to provide a 24-hour
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was clear from all the advance information that the protest
could be on a scale that could quickly overwhelm the resources of
the Florham Park Police Department as well as the contiguous
municipalities that would usually provide mutual aid in an
emergency situation,'' according to a statement from Morris County
Prosecutor John B. Dangler and the chiefs association.
</P>
<P>
   Every town in Morris County, except for Victory Gardens, which
has no police department, contributed personnel to the effort, as
did several agencies from the state and neighboring counties,
including NJ Transit, $9,207; and the Passaic County Sheriff's
Department, $5,217.
</P>
<P>
   The regional deployment system was created last year to deal
with natural disasters and civil disturbances, Linne said.

<HEADLINE> Islanders Bought By Computer Execs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Islanders traveled down a
familiar road Wednesday, with a new owner promising a restoration
for a franchise that once ruled the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   The team got its fourth set of owners in the past six seasons
when two computer executives -- and hockey novices -- bought the
Islanders from New York Sports Ventures for an estimated $190
million.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wang is president and chief executive officer of
Computer Associates, one of Long Island's biggest firms. His
partner in the sale is Sanjay Kumar, the chief operating officer of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County Executive Thomas Gulotta said he and Wang
discussed plans for a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's another topic for another day,'' Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   They take over a team that once won four straight Stanley Cups
(1980-83) but has not made the playoffs the last six years and has
not had a winning season since 1992-93. The Islanders had 58 points
this season, third worst in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners, pending league approval, succeed Howard and
Edward Milstein and Steven Gluckstern.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not in this for a land grab,'' Wang said. ''We knew it
wouldn't make economical sense. But Sanjay and I are very
community-minded people, and we both know that having a strong
professional sports team strengthens a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang wants the emphasis on winning.
</P>
<P>
   ''A winning team brings about a lot of things,'' he said. ''It
brings fans back, it brings about a new building, and so much
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang, 54, and Kumar, 38, knew little about hockey when the
opportunity arose to buy the team. Both are basketball fans and had
hoped to bring an NBA team to Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been reading my 'Hockey for Dummies' book, and Sanjay is
reading his textbooks,'' Wang said. ''A lot of this is new to me,
but it will be run like any good business.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang and Kumar plan no changes in management, a relief to
general manager Mike Milbury.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now have the resources to be a first-class organization,''
Milbury said. ''These two gentlemen are wide open with regards to
the team, the arena, everything. It's nice to know that we can now
compete with our colleagues with regards to free agency. It's not a
slanted field any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Milbury will have more money to work with, Wang sounded a
note of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we increase our payroll to four times what it is now, does
that mean we will have four times as many wins?'' Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders have played at the Coliseum since entering the NHL
in 1972. The Coliseum is owned by the county and leased until 2015
to SMG, a Philadelphia management company.
</P>
<P>
   The Milstein brothers and Gluckstern purchased the team in 1998
after businessman John Spano's tenure ended in disgrace when he was
convicted on wire fraud charges. Spano's deal with owner John
Pickett fell apart when he failed to meet payment deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, there was controversy over conditions in the
Coliseum. The Milsteins and Gluckstern threatened to move, even
talking about playing some home games in other arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders have had contentious relations with the county and
SMG about a new arena. For Wang and Kumar to buy the team, Nassau
County and SMG had to agree.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Gay Issues Club Ban Unfair  </HEADLINE>
By HANNAH WOLFSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A student club that focuses on gay and
lesbian issues will be allowed to meet while its case against the
school district is considered, a federal judge decided Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Judge Tena Campbell granted PRISM -- or People Respecting
Important Social Movements -- a preliminary injunction, ruling that
the school district unfairly denied the East High School students
permission to meet.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, she suggested that school officials violated
their own policy and the Constitution in snubbing PRISM.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the school district eliminated all nonacademic clubs
rather than allow a gay club at East High, a move that was upheld
in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Jessica Cohen and Maggie Hinckley applied in
February to set up PRISM as an academic club. The club's goal is to
discuss history through gay and lesbian issues, and their
application said the club would ''expand and enhance our study and
understanding of American history and government.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cynthia Seidel, Assistant Superintendent of the Salt Lake
City School District, turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   She said the club's gay subject matter was too narrow, and thus
not curriculum-related.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Campbell disagreed, saying the school board was being
unfair because no narrowness provision had been put in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has vindicated the important Constitutional requirement
that when government regulators, including school officials, set
about restricting free speech ... they can't keep moving the goal
posts,'' said Stephen Clark, an attorney with the American Civil
Liberties Union who represented Cohen and Hinckley.

<HEADLINE> Braves 5, Dodgers 1  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Andres Galarraga homered again, Kevin Millwood
pitched seven strong innings and the Atlanta Braves won their ninth
in a row, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones and Chipper Jones also hit back-to-back homers for
the Braves, whose winning streak is their longest since they put
together 10 consecutive victories from Aug. 19-29 last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will try to complete a 9-0 homestand and a three-game
sweep of the Dodgers when the teams meet Thursday at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood (2-0) allowed only five hits and an unearned run, which
came across in the fourth when shortstop Walt Weiss booted a slow
grounder up the middle with the bases loaded. The Dodgers, coming
off consecutive 1-0 losses, snapped a 24-inning scoreless streak.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta broke through in the third against Dodgers rookie Eric
Gagne (0-1), who allowed five hits in six innings but was burned by
the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones hit a 2-1 fastball into the left-center field seats
for his fifth homer of the season. Two pitches later, Chipper Jones
took another high fastball into the right-field bleachers for his
fourth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, continuing his amazing comeback from cancer, added
another solo homer -- his eighth of the season -- in the sixth to
give the Braves a 3-1 lead. Once again, Gagne was burned when he
tried to blow a fastball by an Atlanta hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga began the night one off the NL home-run lead, shared
by Arizona's Steve Finley and San Francisco's Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta added two more runs in the seventh on RBI singles by
Quilvio Veras and Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger and John Rocker finished for the Braves, whose
bullpen has allowed only one earned run in 19 1-3 innings during
the winning streak. Rocker loaded the bases with three walks in the
ninth, but got Devon White to ground into a double play to end it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' frustration was summed up in the eighth by Gary
Sheffield, who was ejected after arguing on a checked-swing third
strike.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Braves tied a club record with their 10th straight home
victory. Before winning the first eight games on this homestand,
Atlanta had two victories against San Francisco at Turner Field.
... Atlanta outfielder Reggie Sanders went 0-for-3 to stretch his
hitless streak to 30 consecutive at-bats. ... Despite the loss, the
Dodgers' 11-9 start is still their best since 1997. .... There were
some noticeable boos when Rocker sprinted in from the bullpen,
although most of the crowd gave him another standing ovation.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Tapes Released to Public  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Large pools of blood soak into beige
carpet, marked by yellow paper cards bearing victims' names.
Calculators and pencils lie next to open books on tables. A
computer monitor sits blown to bits.
</P>
<P>
   To the horror of Columbine victims' families, authorities
released videotapes Wednesday that offer the public the first
glimpse of the high school's library at least a day after two
students killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher before committing
suicide on April 20, 1999. Ten of those students and the gunmen
died in the library.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities charged $25 for each tape.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly three-hour tape, part of it set eerily to a pop music
soundtrack that was added when it was turned into a training video,
was mostly shot by firefighters. It also includes aerial footage
taken by TV news teams that showed wounded and two slain students
outside Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time today, I saw my daughter being dragged over
to the fire engine. I don't need to see that and nobody else needs
to see that,'' said Beth Nimmo, mother of slain student Rachel
Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something you'd see on a gory music video,'' said Nimmo,
her voice choked with anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts. They have pictures from the helicopter of dragging
Richard by his feet,'' said Connie Michalik, whose son, Richard
Castaldo, was shot outside the school and paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Attorney Frank Hutfless released the videotapes
to the victims' families Tuesday to comply with a court order. He
said he then released them to anyone who asked for them ''to avoid
additional lawsuits by the public or news media.''
</P>
<P>
   With Sarah McLachlan's ''I Will Remember You'' playing in the
background, the video, taken by firefighters, enters the library
through open doors, flanked by windows that had been shattered by
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   It shows books pulled to the floor. Chairs are askew, as if
pushed out of the way hurriedly. Bullets have shattered windows and
punctured walls. A window blind is still jumbled from a student's
hurried escape.
</P>
<P>
   The pools of blood on desks and on the earth-tone carpeted floor
capture the eye. Folded yellow cards are carefully placed near the
stains to mark the names of victims. Numbered cards mark pieces of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each one of those pools of blood is where someone's child died
or was seriously wounded,'' said attorney James Rouse, who
represents some of the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   The video does not show bodies inside the school. It has scenes
of the cafeteria, which was heavily damaged by gunfire and bombs,
but it does not include the surveillance footage from a cafeteria
camera that was broadcast on some news programs last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The gruesome images are intertwined with typical school details
-- trophy cases, desks lined in rows in classrooms, a neon light
blinking messages about report cards and wishing spring sports
teams ''good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Six victims' relatives had sued to gain access to the tapes to
prove authorities mishandled the rescue and failed to heed warnings
of the rampage. Authorities have denied those allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But many Columbine families had hoped the tapes would not be
released to the public as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm totally disgusted they're selling the tapes for $25,''
Michalik said. ''Where is the $25 going? We had to fight like crazy
to even get these tapes released.''
</P>
<P>
   County officials have not said what the money will be used for.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of people showed up at the county attorney's office to
get copies of the tapes. Robin Brandfas, with her two sons and a
son's friend in tow, was first in line. She said she wanted a copy
of the videotape to try to teach her sons ''what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel really bad for the parents and everyone involved,''
Brandfas said. ''I just want to see for myself. You hope it never
happens to your kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine relatives also said they were outraged that the
videotape, adapted by a Littleton firefighter for the training of
police and fire personnel around the country, contained added
background music, including ''If It Were Up To Me,'' by Cheryl
Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Lyrics include the lines: ''Maybe it's the movies, maybe it's
the books, maybe it's the bullets, maybe it's the real crooks,
maybe it's the drugs, maybe it's the parents.'' It concludes:
''Maybe it's the end, but I know one thing. If it were up to me,
I'd take away the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Rouse, the relatives' lawyer, said some families turned down the
audio as they watched. ''I don't know why you'd call it a training
video. It's more of a documentary with a musical background,''
Rouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton fire officials did not return calls for comment about
why the firefighter added music to the tape. In a written
statement, they said the firefighter produced the tape on his own
time, using his own equipment.
</P>
<P>
   They also objected to the release of the video, saying it is
''not suitable for public viewing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Narde, a spokeswoman for the city of Littleton, defended
the tape, saying it was put to good use in 82 training seminars in
the United States and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Ravaged Mozambique Still Needy  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Images of Mozambicans clinging
to trees above swirling floodwaters are already a fading memory,
but their country now faces a critical phase in its recovery, a top
U.N. official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The flood victims who were plucked to safety by helicopters have
been returning to their homes -- or what's left of them -- and need
roads, bridges, schools and hospitals rebuilt, said Mark Malloch
Brown, head of the United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a system of dams that will hold back floodwaters
that poured into Mozambique last February and March from upstream
neighboring countries Zimbabwe and South Africa also needs to be
constructed to prevent a recurrence of the disaster, Malloch Brown
said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''The second act is starting,'' said Malloch Brown, who will be
hosting an international donor conference for Mozambique in Rome on
May 3-4.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to raise dlrs 450 million in the Rome conference, which
will be attended by representatives of dozens of nations, aid
agencies and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of countries and aid groups provided emergency aid to
Mozambique during the height of the crisis. But other crises -- a
looming famine in Ethiopia, violent political turmoil in Zimbabwe --
have grabbed headlines since the floodwaters receded, and threaten
to distract donors from following through on Mozambique's recovery,
Malloch Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The southeast African country had once been a poster child for
the misery that can strike the continent. A 15-year civil war
killed 600,000 people before it ended in 1992. Marxists who took
over from the departing Portuguese colonial government in 1975
struggled to build the country, which nevertheless stagnated as one
of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   But after the government liberalized its economy in the
mid-1980s, foreign investors flocked in. The country's economy
recently averaged 10 percent annual growth. Most Mozambicans
remained poor, but the economic boom held the promise of a better
future.
</P>
<P>
   Then the floods came.
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rains from two cyclones swept away the homes or
livelihoods of 10 percent of Mozambique's 19 million people. They
damaged more than 600 primary schools, wrecked more than 620 miles
of roads and downed 250 miles of power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Crops in fertile river valleys in central and southern
Mozambique were destroyed. Large tracts of agricultural land have
become quagmires.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Luisa Biogo recently cut economic growth
projections to 6 percent for this year, and said inflation would
almost double to 10 percent. The World Bank's preliminary estimates
of the cost of the flooding is about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Malloch Brown, speaking from Dakar, Senegal, where he was
attending an education conference, said donors should help
Mozambique recover totally from the disaster, in order to keep one
of the continent's rare success stories going.

</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals broke the mark of 49 set by the 1997 Cleveland
Indians. They have four games left to chase the record for homers
in any month, 58 by the 1987 Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, St. Louis broke the previous National League record
of 41 by the 1998 Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   All three homers came off Steve Woodard of the Milwaukee
Brewers. Ankiel hit a three-run shot in the fourth, Edmonds had a
leadoff homer in the fifth, and Tatis broke the record with a
two-run shot later in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have homered in 17 straight games, tying the team
record set in 1998, with 40 homers in that span. They've connected
in all but one of their 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis hit 194 home runs last season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Jonathan Allen, an MIT professor who
developed a talking computer at a time when such a machine sounded
like science fiction, died Monday. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   Allen received worldwide notice in the 1970s for creating a
computer named Morris that could talk and read. A computer system
developed by Allen has been used to aid physicist Stephen Hawking,
who is paralyzed as a result of Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   A member of MIT's faculty since 1968, Allen had directed the
school's research laboratory of electronics since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's research centered on speech processing, computational
linguistics, computer architecture and integrated electronics.
Jack Best:
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Jack Best, who helped build a glider for an
audacious plan to escape from Germany's Colditz prison during World
War II, died Saturday. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners at Colditz were freed by Allied forces before the
glider could be tried, but a reconstruction made for a television
program last year proved that the craft could have flown.
</P>
<P>
   Best, a Royal Air Force pilot, was captured in 1941 after he was
forced to ditch his plane off the coast of Greece. He was held at
Stalag Luft III prison -- known from the film ''The Great Escape'' --
but tunneled out with fellow prisoner Bill Goldfinch. They made it
125 miles to Szczecin, Poland before being recaptured.
</P>
<P>
   Best was then sent to Colditz, a huge Saxon castle near Leipzig
where the Germans put their most escape-prone Allied prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Best worked with Goldfinch and two other prisoners to build a
glider with a 32-foot wingspan in an attic above the chapel.
Andre Jarrot:
</P>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Andre Jarrot, a French Resistance hero who went on
to a successful political career, died Thursday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac described him as ''a legendary figure
of Free France'' during World War II who ''dedicated his life to
his country and his fellow citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrot was parachuted many times into Nazi-occupied territory in
France and led sabotage operations against key French industrial
sites fueling the German war effort.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he was mayor of Montceau-les-Mines in Burgundy
from 1965 to 1986 and a member of the European Parliament from
1962-1984. Jarrot also was Quality of Life Minister from 1974-76
and a member of the French Senate from 1986 to 1995. He was a
founding member of the Union for the New Republic, the predecessor
of Chirac's center-right Rally for the Republic party.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrot was captured by the Germans following the French
capitulation in the summer of 1940, but quickly escaped. He made
his way by bicycle back to Burgundy, where he soon devised escape
routes for other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Some 4,000 Allied airmen, shot down in Europe during the war,
are thought to have escaped from German hands thanks to Jarrot's
careful planning. He was arrested again by the Gestapo in 1942, but
was released for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, the United States, Britain and Belgium decorated
him for his heroism. Gen. Charles de Gaulle awarded him the Cross
of the Liberation, one of France's highest military honors.
David Merrick:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Broadway producer David Merrick, whose savvy
sense of show business and popular taste helped create such
enduring musical hits as ''Gypsy,'' ''Hello, Dolly!'' and ''42nd
Street,'' died Tuesday. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick dominated New York theater in Broadway's Golden Age
after World War II, producing more than 80 shows including
''Oliver!,'' ''Carnival,'' ''Fanny,'' ''Look Back in Anger,''
''Becket,'' ''Irma La Douce,'' ''Play It Again, Sam,'' ''A Taste of
Honey,'' ''Stop the World -- I Want to Get Off,'' ''Cactus Flower,''
''Philadelphia, Here I Come,'' ''Forty Carats,'' ''I Do! I Do!''
and ''Promises, Promises.''
</P>
<P>
   The reviews for ''Fanny,'' which starred Ezio Pinza, Walter
Slezak and newcomer Florence Henderson, were largely negative. Yet
the producer got a two-year run out of the show through heavy
advertising and a series of stunts that kept it in the news.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick was a master at extending the lives of his productions
through big-name casting, too. He was one of the first producers to
use stars to replace stars. With ''Hello, Dolly!'', he had a
succession of famous Dollys follow Channing in the title role,
including Ginger Rogers, Martha Raye, Betty Grable, Pearl Bailey,
Phyllis Diller and Ethel Merman, who closed the show after a run of
2,844 performances.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s and 1960s, the producer reportedly grossed $20
million annually, earning $2 million a year from his hits. His
productions have won countless Tony Awards -- ''Hello, Dolly!''
alone picked up 10 Tonys in 1964 -- as well as other theater prizes
including the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award and London's
Olivier Award.
</P>
<P>
   His flops were well-known, too, particularly ''Breakfast at
Tiffany's,'' which never officially opened in New York despite the
potent box-office draw of Mary Tyler Moore and Richard Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick's private life was as stormy as his public one. He had
five wives and six marriages. He was married to wife No. 3, Etan,
twice.
Frank Rothman:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former MGM chairman Frank Rothman, considered
one of the nation's top sports and entertainment attorneys, died
Tuesday of complications following surgery. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman had handled lawsuits involving the National Football
League, the National Basketball Association and the Professional
Golfers Association. His entertainment industry clients included
Warner Bros., Walt Disney Co., Paramount Pictures, Home Box Office
and 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman litigated a number of landmark cases, including one
involving basketball player Spencer Haywood that led to the
''hardship rule,'' which allows undergraduates to leave college
before four years and play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   He also represented a number of teams, including the Boston
Celtics, the Seattle Supersonics, the Portland Trailblazers and the
Los Angeles Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Kerkorian, MGM's principal stockholder, asked Rothman in
1982 to take the company's top job. After four years as MGM
chairman and chief executive, Rothman decided to return to law.
Robert L. Zion:
</P>
<P>
   IMLAYSTOWN, N.J. (AP) -- Robert L. Zion, a landscape architect
who redesigned the grounds of the Statue of Liberty during its 1986
centennial, died Tuesday following an accident. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Zion was internationally known for his work that also included
Liberty State Park in Jersey City, Cincinnati's Riverfront Park and
the Sculpture Garden at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Boston Fugitive Dies After Standoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A fugitive in a bulletproof vest took his own life
during a standoff with police Wednesday after he shouted to his
mother that he knew he faced decades in prison, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Taylor had been sought by police since Sept. 2, when he and
his friend, murder suspect Jason Pierce, allegedly exchanged
gunfire with police near a mall in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, 21, had been sought for an Aug. 26 shooting in an
Atlanta suburb that injured his girlfriend and killed her two
roommates. The three women had recently moved from Boston to
Georgia to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was injured in the Brookline gunfight and captured.
Police said Taylor fled on foot and escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Police received a tip that Taylor was at a home in the city's
Roxbury neighborhood about 3:15 p.m. They soon observed him through
a window in a third-floor apartment, said police spokesman Cliff
Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not fire any shots during the standoff, though Taylor
fired several times after officers and relatives pleaded with him
to surrender, police said. He fired again through the apartment
door as police tried to break it down, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Before officers got inside, he fired for a last time, shooting
himself in the head, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he knows where he'll be for the next 25, 30 years,''
Connolly said. ''All of us basically came to the conclusion that he
was not going to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was taken to Boston Medical Center, where he died, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Three people who had been in the apartment left before the
shooting started, police said. The three could face charges of
harboring a fugitive, Connolly said.

<HEADLINE> Indians 5, Mariners 3, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Einar Diaz and Jacob Cruz hit RBI singles with
two outs in the 10th inning Wednesday and the Cleveland Indians
defeated the Seattle Mariners 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Jaret Wright, bidding to become part of the first father-son
pair to pitch no-hitters, shut down Seattle until Stan Javier's
leadoff single in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners tied it at 3 in the ninth on Jay Buhner's RBI
single off Paul Shuey (1-0). Seattle then loaded the bases with one
out, but pinch-runner Carlos Hernandez was caught in a failed
suicide squeeze attempt and David Bell struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Sexson singled with one out in the Cleveland 10th off
Arthur Rhodes (1-2) and Enrique Wilson singled with two outs. Diaz
and Cruz followed with their singles.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was trying to duplicate the feat of his dad, Clyde, who
pitched a no-hitter for the California Angels against Oakland on
July 3, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   After Javier singled in the seventh, Alex Rodriguez followed by
hitting a 3-1 pitch over the center-field fence for his seventh
homer to tie it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez hit a leadoff home run in the Indians eighth for a
3-2 lead. His sixth homer came against former teammate Jose Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland center fielder Kenny Lofton made the play of the game,
reaching over the wall to rob John Olerud of his third home run in
four days. That catch came in the fourth inning, right after
shortstop Omar Vizquel sprawled on his stomach to take away a hit
on a hard grounder by Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton left in the ninth because of a strained left biceps.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Indians six innings to score against rookie Rob
Ramsay. He was called up from Triple-A Tacoma to start in place of
the injured Freddy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar bunted for a single in the sixth, stole second
and scored on a single by David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians made it 2-0 in the seventh off Mesa. Wilson doubled,
Diaz sacrificed and Lofton had a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Indians have Thursday off before playing a three-game
weekend series against Boston at Jacobs Field. The Indians were
rained out of three games at Fenway Park last weekend. ...
Rodriguez's homer broke a 2-for-18 slump in the Mariners'
homestand. It was his first homer since hitting three in the
SkyDome on April 16.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 9, Padres 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Brian Giles hit a two-out single in the bottom
of the ninth to give the Pittsburgh Pirates a 9-8 victory over the
San Diego Padres on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres intentionally walked Jason Kendall to allow
left-hander Matt Whisenant (2-1) to face the left-handed hitting
Giles.
</P>
<P>
   Giles' liner went over shortstop Damian Jackson to score John
Vander Wal from second without a play. Vander Wal drew a one-out
walk from Whisenant and stole second.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres tied it with three unearned runs in the top of the
ninth against Pirates closer Mike Williams (1-1). Jackson reached
on shortstop Pat Meares' error, stole second and scored when second
baseman Warren Morris couldn't handle Tony Gwynn's grounder for
another error.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko hit a 2-1 pitch into the right-field seats for his
fifth home run of the season and the fourth pinch-homer of his
career. It was Williams' first blown save in three opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Meares' first career grand slam -- one of three Pittsburgh home
runs -- broke a 4-4 tie in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Giles opened the inning with a single and advanced to third on
Kevin Young's double. Wil Cordero walked to load the bases, and
Meares drove a 1-0 pitch over the left-field wall for his first
grand slam in 772 major league games and 2,635 at-bats. It was the
first time this season the Pirates have hit more than two home runs
in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Padres starter Woody Williams gave up 11 hits and eight runs in
five-plus innings. The other runs came on two-run homers -- Kendall
hit his first of the year in the first inning and Chad Hermansen
hit his first in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Sprague doubled in each of his first three at-bats for the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The first double came in the first inning and drove in two runs.
Sprague scored on Eric Owens' single. Sprague scored in the third
on Bret Boone's single. San Diego got a run in the eighth against
Brad Clontz. Boone walked, went to third on Wiki Gonzalez's single
and scored when Carlos Hernandez hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Padres pitcher Matt Clement will have a long ticket list
for his start this afternoon. Clement is from nearby Butler, Pa.,
and will make his first appearance against the Pirates in
Pittsburgh. ... Williams has allowed nine home runs in five starts
this season. ... The Pirates are 2-0 since manager Gene Lamont
revamped the lineup, moving Hermansen to the leadoff spot with
Kendall third and Meares seventh. ... Garcia singled in his first
major league plate appearance in the fifth.

<HEADLINE> Reds 12, Mets 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- All the Cincinnati Reds needed to break their
four-game skid was for Denny Neagle's turn in the rotation to come
back around.
</P>
<P>
   After watching his teammates get pummeled the last few days,
Neagle allowed two hits in seven scoreless innings to snap the New
York Mets' nine-game winning streak with a 12-1 victory Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young went 4-for-5 with a homer and five RBIs, and Ed
Taubensee added three hits, a home run and three RBIs for
Cincinnati, which ended its longest losing streak since September
1998 and the Mets' longest winning stretch since May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the story for the Reds, who had allowed 42 runs in the last
four games, was the performance by Neagle (2-0), who had no trouble
pitching on a rainy, 43-degree night.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander struck out nine and walked four, not allowing a
runner to reach third base until two outs in the sixth inning.
Neagle, who hasn't lost since Aug. 25, won a career-high eighth
straight decision. He also got Cincinnati's previous win last
Thursday against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle was staked to a 2-0 lead on Young's two-run homer before
he even took the mound and was barely threatened all game.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed only a pair of doubles. Benny Agbayani blooped a ball
to center that bounced off Ken Griffey Jr.'s glove in the second
inning, and Mike Piazza hit a scorcher to left-center in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Pokey Reese led off the game with a single, and Young hit a 75
mph fastball from knuckleballer Dennis Springer (0-1) into the
left-field bullpen for his third homer. Rickey Henderson barely
moved as the ball sailed over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Young added an RBI double in the second inning when Agbayani,
starting in center field for just the second time this season,
turned the wrong way on a deep drive.
</P>
<P>
   Young singled in the sixth and nearly got his first career cycle
in the seventh inning. With runners on first and second, Young hit
a drive to center that scored both runners. He tried to stretch the
hit into a triple but was thrown out on a relay at third. Young
tied a career high for RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Taubensee had an RBI single in the fifth and a two-run homer in
the seventh, his third of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Boone added an RBI double in the third off Springer, who
allowed eight runs, 13 hits and four walks in six-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Stynes hit a two-run double and Dante Bichette had an RBI
single in the ninth as the Reds had a season high in runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored their only run in the eighth when Jon Nunnally
tripled off Manny Aybar and scored on Derek Bell's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Neagle is 8-0 with a 2.56 ERA in 12 starts since Aug. 30.
... Neagle is 6-2 with an 2.11 ERA in 14 games at Shea Stadium. ...
Griffey, who blocked a trade to the Mets last winter, was booed
once again and went 1-for-4 with a walk. ... With the Mets playing
19 games in 18 days, Kurt Abbott started at third base in place of
Robin Ventura. ... Piazza has 15 extra-base hits -- 11 doubles and
four homers -- in his last 15 games.

<P>
   EDMONTON (AP) -- The leader of a Christian commune convicted of
charges linked to a series of sabotage attacks on oil and gas
installations in northwestern Alberta was sentenced Wednesday to 28
months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Wiebo Ludwig, a former evangelical preacher who moved his
extended family from Ontario to Alberta 13 years ago, was the chief
suspect of a police investigation into more than 160 incidents of
sabotage and vandalism since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig has railed against the fast-growing energy industry in
Alberta, blaming oil and gas projects that now encircle his farm
for killing livestock and causing three miscarriages among the
women in his commune.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted on five of 14 counts, including a possession of
explosives charge from a 1998 explosion at an oil well.
</P>
<P>
   A second defendant, Richard Boonstra, 53, received a 21-day
sentence for his conviction on one mischief charge.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which ranged from minor vandalism to powerful
bombings of oil-well sites, caused no injuries but angered area
residents and prompted energy companies to implement anti-terrorism
programs. l

<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero hit his 100th career home run
and raised his NL-leading average to .452, leading the Montreal
Expos over the Colorado Rockies 9-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero singled in his first two at-bats, then was hit in the
right hand by a pitch from Kevin Jarvis (1-1) in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero shouted at Jarvis, and was escorted down the first base
line by plate umpire Rick Reed. Both managers came out of the
dugout, with Montreal's Felipe Alou pointing Colorado's Buddy Bell.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Guerrero hit a drive off Julian Tavarez for a
420-foot homer run.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero stood and watched as the ball cleared the fence before
breaking into his home-run trot. He came out of the dugout for a
curtain call to acknowledge the cheers from the crowd of 10,735.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Guerrero has 100 home runs in 1,657 career
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero's brother, Wilton, had a two-run, pinch-hit double that
put the Expos ahead 3-1 in the seventh. Montreal scored six times
in the eighth, capped by Rondell White's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos won their third in a row and finished 6-2 on their
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hermanson (3-1) allowed one run and three hits in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lansing's RBI single off Scott Strickland in the eighth
drew the Rockies to within 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Ugueth Urbina got the last four outs for his sixth save in eight
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson, who pitched his second career shutout at Philadelphia
on April 14, has lowered his ERA from 6.55 to 2.57 over his last
three starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies purchased Jarvis' contract from Triple-A Colorado
Springs prior to his first start last Friday in St. Louis.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks slipped early Thursday following a
retreat on Wall Street. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 46.86 points,
or 0.26 percent, to 18,087.45 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Wednesday, the average closed down 138.02 points, or 0.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.22 yen, up 0.34 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo but below its late New York level of 106.27 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, Tokyo players remained cautious about
prospects for the U.S. stock market. They said investors were
awaiting key U.S. economic data due out later Thursday, including
gross domestic product for the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   But traders said the Tokyo market's downside is solid amid
expectations for buying from newly established investment trusts.

<HEADLINE> Parks Buck Trend of Cleaner Air  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The nation's air-quality picture improved
overall from 1989 to 1998, but grew hazy in many national parks,
according to a report released Wednesday by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The annual report found that ozone levels rose significantly in
seven of 24 national parks measured, from the Great Smoky Mountains
in North Carolina and Tennessee to Denali in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The ozone news was better for Southern Californians, who breathe
some of the nation's dirtiest air but saw pollution trends move in
a positive direction.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Southern California metropolitan areas had less than
half as many poor-air-quality days as they did in 1989. Overall,
ozone levels across the United State dropped by about 4 percent
during this period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   David Mintz, the report's team leader, said that while the news
is good for Southern California, the area still leads the way in
air pollution, with the Los Angeles and Riverside areas seeing
about 80 poor air-quality days in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, rates fell for all six ''criteria pollutants'' --
carbon monoxide, lead, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter
and sulfur dioxide. Ozone saw the smallest decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Among national parks, ozone problems worsened the most in Great
Smoky Mountains and Shenandoah in Virginia, with each seeing
increases of more than 30 percent over the span of the report,
Mintz said.
</P>
<P>
   He said two reasons for the ozone increase in rural areas are
pollution migrating from urban areas and emissions from power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the long term, we're doing better,'' Mintz said. ''But as
you start looking regionally ... there's cause for concern.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- The mother of a soldier murdered in
his barracks filed a $1.8 million claim Wednesday against the Army,
alleging it ignored underage drinking and harassment of her son.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow soldiers believed Pfc. Barry Winchell was gay and
harassed him for months before he was beaten to death with a
baseball bat last July, according to testimony at the murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Winchell's mother, Patricia Kutteles, alleges the Army knew
about the harassment but did nothing to stop it. Fort Campbell
officials ignored underage drinking on the base and did not provide
a way for soldiers to call 911 from the barracks, her claim
alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Adam Pachter said the claim was filed under a federal
law that allows reimbursement from the military for injury or
death.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Pamela Hart, a Fort Campbell spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the claim but said soldiers can now reach 911 from the
barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Calvin N. Glover, 19, was convicted of premeditated murder
and sentenced to life in prison for the attack.

<HEADLINE> Castro Backs Raid, Differs on Guns  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro on Wednesday praised the
raid by U.S. agents that whisked Elian Gonzalez from his relatives,
but said that in Cuba such an operation would have been conducted
without guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can see obviously that the people were well-trained,''
Castro said Wednesday, referring to photos of the raid Saturday
that took the 6-year-old child from the Miami home of his
great-uncle. ''They did it well.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said in Cuba, ''we do it with unarmed people.'' Castro
said Cuba's coastal authorities are trained to board vessels
unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said agents were armed during
Saturday's raid because of reports that there might be weapons in
the Miami house where Elian was residing with his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Castro also lashed out at American officials for not allowing
Cuban child specialists to visit the 6-year-old in preparation for
his possible return to the island. He said that Washington's
refusal to permit the full 31-member delegation proposed by Cuba
''cannot be explained.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a single specialist, not a single psychologist, not a
single psychiatrist,'' have been approved by U.S. officials, Castro
told reporters after visiting a special boarding school in Havana
being prepared for Elian and his classmates to attend if the boy is
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Castro spent a few minutes touring the converted house where
Cuban officials say Elian will stay if a federal court allows him
to leave the United States, where he has been since being rescued
after a shipwreck that killed his mother in late November.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Elian's former kindergarten teacher Agueda Fleitas
and cousin Yasmany Betancourt were flying to Washington, carrying
school materials, gifts and mementos for the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Elian's schoolmates and four of their parents applied
Wednesday for visas to visit the United States as well. U.S.
officials have said the visas will be expedited.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am going to give him a kiss and a very strong hug,''
10-year-old Yasmany said in an interview broadcast by Cuban state
television Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba had asked U.S. officials for permission to send a much
larger delegation including 12 schoolchildren, three teachers, five
psychologists or psychiatrists and six doctors.
</P>
<P>
   University of Havana psychologist Aurora Garcia, a proposed
member of the group, said the idea is to help the boy ''restore his
historical memory,'' cure psychological wounds caused the stress of
recent months and prepare him for return to his Cuban friends.

<HEADLINE> Elian Doc: No Miami Visitors Yet  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A child psychiatrist who interviewed Elian
Gonzalez for the government recommended Wednesday against a visit
by his Miami relatives ''in their current angry state.'' And the
6-year-old Cuban boy's father asked a federal court to allow him
alone to speak for his son.
</P>
<P>
   As Elian remained secluded in rural Maryland with his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, stepmother and half brother, Dr. Paulina F.
Kernberg of Cornell University Medical College reported that Elian
has had ''a positive reunion with his father'' and displays a
''sense of well-being and happiness with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the anger expressed by the Miami relatives over the raid
that took Elian from them Saturday, Kernberg said, ''In that frame
of mind, they would likely be disruptive for the child, who demands
a quiet period of emotional healing from the last few weeks of
stress.''
</P>
<P>
   She recommended the Miami relatives seek counseling ''to aid
them in accepting and supporting Elian's reunion with his father.''
The boy would benefit for now from receiving letters, photos and
taped messages from them, Kernberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Gregory Craig, attorney for Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
asked in an emergency petition for the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta ''to assert his rights as a father ... to speak
on behalf of Elian, who has no other suitable representative.''
</P>
<P>
   The father asked the court to reject a bid by the boy's
great-uncle and former temporary guardian, Lazaro Gonzalez, to have
his lawyers and doctors see Elian and speak for him before the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez -- and they are Lazaro's lawyers,
not Elian's -- seek to use machination and legal sleight of hand to
turn this court into the arbiter of an intra-family dispute,'' the
Craig brief said. ''This case cries out for this father's personal
intervention to save his son from further manipulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also filed its opposition to Lazaro's
motion for a court-appointed guardian to examine and speak for
Elian. It pledged to provide the court with regular reports from a
psychiatrist and a social worker it has hired to monitor Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit is considering the Miami relatives' appeal of a
U.S. district court decision that threw out the political asylum
petition they filed on Elian's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Lazaro Gonzalez and his daughter, Marisleysis,
and other Miami relatives campaigned to keep the boy in this
country despite his father's desire to take him home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The great-uncle, his daughter and other Miami relatives who came
to Washington Saturday flew back to Miami on Wednesday night, said
Emilio Vasquez of the Cuban American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Kernberg, fluent in Spanish, spent 2{ hours Tuesday with the
Gonzalez family at Andrews Air Force Base just before they went to
their new retreat at the Wye River Plantation on Maryland's Eastern
Shore. She spent time alone with the father and with the entire
family.
</P>
<P>
   Although Marisleysis Gonzalez has characterized her relationship
to Elian as that of a surrogate mother, Kernberg said Elian may
have a schoolboy crush on her. Elian confided to his stepmother
that he has a secret love, Mary, Kernberg said in a declaration the
Justice Department supplied the 11th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''His feelings for Marisleysis are similar to the romantic
feelings of a school boy for his teacher or a wished-for
girlfriend,'' Kernberg wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The child psychiatrist gave Elian plastic soldiers, similar in
appearance to the Border Patrol agents who removed him in from the
Miami home, to gauge whether the raid left lasting damage.
</P>
<P>
   The boy played with the toy soldiers ''with pleasure and without
anxiety,'' Kernberg wrote. ''His removal from his Miami relatives'
home, although clearly startling and frightening, was in all
likelihood not a traumatic experience producing lasting effects.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, where Republicans planned hearings next
Wednesday on the pre-dawn Saturday raid that removed Elian from
Lazaro's home, the Florida relatives presented rival doctors who
challenged Kernberg's conclusions. They called on President Clinton
and Attorney General Janet Reno to permit Florida-based ''medical
professionals trusted by Elian'' to evaluate him.
</P>
<P>
   Kernberg spent too little time with Elian for a proper
evaluation, said Dr. Lidya Usategui, a Miami child psychiatrist.
Dr. Jose Carro, president of the Cuban Pediatric Society in Exile,
said, ''In our view, he (Elian) continues to suffer.... Elian
should have access to his family from Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   At the wooded Maryland retreat, Elian awaited visits by his
former kindergarten teacher and a 10-year-old cousin who traveled
to the United States on Wednesday from Cuba. The teacher and cousin
flew into Washington's Reagan National Airport on Wednesday night
and were driven to an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, four of Elian's Cuban classmates, along with three
of their mothers and one father, are expected to receive visas from
the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana and fly to the United States
on Thursday. ''A young 6-year-old ... needs to have someone to play
with,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Kernberg described Elian as playful and at ease with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian has a relationship with his father that is characterized
by admiration and pride,'' she wrote. The boy ''drew a picture of a
man on a mountaintop and told me that the image was his 'daddy
looking around'.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian enjoyed hanging from his father's shoulders or in an
upside-down position or simply cuddling with him. Whenever he made
eye contact with his father, his face brightened,'' Kernberg wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the INS revealed the Border Patrol agents' view of the
raid they conducted to seize Elian.
</P>
<P>
   One of the eight reported he ''had never encountered this much
resistance,'' said INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona.
</P>
<P>
   ''The agents said the crowd around the house was extremely
aggressive and hostile,'' Cardona said. ''The female agent, Betty
Mills, was pushed to the ground on the way in.'' Several people
formed a human chain at the door.
</P>
<P>
   The agents identified themselves and asked for cooperation,
''but they did not get it despite the family's promise to just open
the door peacefully if we came to get Elian,'' Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a couch pushed against the door, so the agents had
to breach the door. Inside all the while, family members and
supporters were screaming at the agents.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent photographed holding an automatic weapon as he
encountered a terrified Elian ''made a specific decision to keep
the safety lock on because he feared he would encounter a physical
struggle and didn't want the gun to go off accidentally,'' Cardona
said.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Sen. Approves Labor Reform  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- The Argentine Senate approved a
controversial labor reform bill Wednesday, handing President
Fernando De la Rua his biggest political victory to date in his bid
to restart Argentina's fledgling economy.
</P>
<P>
   The late night vote came after daylong protests by thousands of
union workers opposed to the government's effort to overhaul the
nation's labor laws. The legislative package will now be sent to
the lower house, where its approval is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for overhauling rigid laws, including extending
the trial period of new hires and lowering employer payroll
contributions for new workers. The government says that will boost
wage flexibility and create more jobs, while reducing the cost of
doing business.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also seeks to decentralize collective bargaining. De la
Rua's ruling center-left Alliance coalition reached a compromise
with foes early Wednesday on a clause to bar companies from
lowering salaries in collective-bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Foes of labor reform gathered outside of the heavily guarded
Congress, waving union banners, banging drums and setting off
bottle rockets as Senators sought to clear obstacles to final
legislative approval of the ambitious bill. Debate of the bill was
postponed last week following a bloody police clash with
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Hardline labor groups noisily protested Wednesday that the bill
would eventually drive up the 14 percent unemployment rate while
sending wages down. Hundreds of police watched from behind mesh
barricades ringing Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Federico Storani ordered out a heavy police
guard, intent on preventing a repeat of last week's violence in
which 30 people were injured. Police used rubber bullets and batons
to break up that demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms have the backing of the International Monetary Fund,
which says Argentina needs more flexibility in its labor markets to
keep the prices of its exports competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Labor reform proved so divisive that it drove a wedge through
Argentina's most powerful union federation: the Confederacion
General de Trabajo.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Moyano, head of a hardline truckers' union that broke away
with other dissidents, has called for a national work stoppage
starting May 5.
</P>
<P>
   He said the police crackdown on demonstrators was proof of the
government's disregard of workers. ''We will fight on behalf of
hungry workers and repudiate what happened a week ago when police
so savagely attacked us,'' he told protestors gathered outside the
Congress hours before the vote.

<HEADLINE> Phillips Hires Top Arco Executive  </HEADLINE>
By T.A. BADGER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE (AP) -- Phillips Petroleum Co. announced Wednesday it
has concluded its $7 billion purchase of Atlantic Richfield Co.'s
properties in Alaska, and that it has hired Arco's top Alaska
executive to head its operations in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Meyers is president and chief executive for the new
company, to be called Phillips Alaska Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can see no other individual who would provide the
leadership and direction that we want,'' said Jim Mulva, chairman
and chief executive for Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers, 46, rose through the Arco ranks during his 20-year
career with the company to become president and CEO of Arco Alaska
Inc., for years the state's second-largest oil producer, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Arco was taken over earlier this month by BP Amoco PLC in a $27
billion deal. Federal regulators required BP to sell Arco Alaska as
a condition of approving the merger.
</P>
<P>
   With its purchase of Arco Alaska, the North Slope has emerged as
Phillips' largest source of crude. The company will produce about
340,000 barrels a day from the Slope, or nearly 40 percent of its
daily output worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' Alaska production will be sold to other refiners on
the West Coast, where Phillips has no refining or retail gasoline
presence, Mulva said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Arco Alaska executives will be joining Meyers in Phillips'
top Alaska management team, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking for minimal disruption,'' Mulva said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Icebreaker Begins Arctic Voyage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A U.S. ship built for traveling through ice-packed
polar waters has started a rare trip through Canada's disputed
Northwest Passage.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage by the U.S. Coast Guard ship Healy is the fourth by
an American-flagged vessel through the passage since Canada and the
United States signed an Arctic cooperation agreement in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, both countries pledged to work together to
help with the navigation of icebreakers and share research,
according to Foreign Affairs spokesman Reynald Doiron.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of who controls the icy link between the Arctic
and Atlantic Oceans has remained unresolved. The United States has
never recognized Canada's 1973 claim of the Northwest Passage as an
internal Canadian waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian scientists on board the Healy plan to collect data on
polar ice and test scientific equipment and the new ship's
performance in Arctic conditions, Doiron said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the cooperation agreement, two U.S. ships sent without
permission -- the oil tanker Manhattan in 1969 and the icebreaker
Polar Sea in 1985 -- caused disputes between the neighboring
countries.left Halifax, Nova Scotia, on April 3 and was expected to
complete its journey in July.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Statements that a man made to police
before he was arrested for the rape and murder of a 13-year-old boy
may be admitted as evidence in his trial, a judge ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Don Carpenter, 38, and his roommate, Joshua M. Brown, 22,
are accused of rape and capital murder in the Sept. 26 death of
13-year-old Jesse Dirkhising at their apartment in Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter is to be tried July 17. Brown will be tried
separately.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys argued Carpenter's constitutional rights were
violated when the Miranda warning that he could remain silent was
not read to him in the hours leading up to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Judge David Clinger disagreed. He also ruled that Carpenter
voluntarily gave consent for police to search the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the teen-ager was tied up and gagged and
repeatedly raped in the men's apartment.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 7, Brewers 0  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Rookie pitcher Rick Ankiel led a three-homer
surge that helped St. Louis set a major league record for April,
and also threw seven scoreless innings as the Cardinals beat the
Milwaukee Brewers 7-0 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds and Fernando Tatis also connected as the Cardinals
reached 50 homers in April, breaking the mark of 49 set by the 1997
Cleveland Indians. They have four games left this month to chase
the record for homers in any month, 58 by the 1987 Baltimore
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel (3-1) hit a three-run shot for his second homer in the
fourth. Edmonds had a leadoff homer in the fifth, and Tatis broke
the record with a two-run shot later in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   All three homers came off Steve Woodard (0-3), who hasn't won in
14 starts since July 16, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have homered in 17 straight games, tying the team
record set in 1998, with 40 homers in that span. They've connected
in all but one of their 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel, 20, allowed three hits and has thrown 14 scoreless
innings his last three starts to lower his ERA to 2.16. He struck
out four and walked three, exhibiting much better control than his
last outing when he walked seven in five innings in a victory over
the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   He's batting .500 with a double, triple and five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, who entered the game in a 1-for-14 slump, had a
sacrifice fly for the game's first run in the third inning. Tatis
singled to extend his hitting streak to a career-best 12 games with
five homers and 17 RBIs in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard lasted five innings and allowed seven runs, six earned,
on seven hits. He's 0-6 with a 5.75 ERA since his last victory.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Woodard also lost to the Cardinals and Darryl Kile on April
8, giving up four earned runs in five innings in a 10-8 loss. ...
The Cardinals hit 194 home runs last season, fifth best in the NL.
... The Cardinals are 4-1 against the Brewers with four straight
victories. ... Ankiel cooled off Geoff Jenkins, who had been
8-for-16 with three homers and seven RBIs in his previous four
games. Jenkins struck out, tapped out to the mound and flied out to
left his three at-bats against Ankiel. ... The Brewers are 1-7 with
one game to go on a nine-game trip, their second-longest of the
year. ... Ankiel is 3-0 with a 1.29 ERA in six starts and 35 career
innings at Busch Stadium.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton
pledged Wednesday that if elected she would not run for president
in four years and said she hoped their time in the United States
would eventually convince Juan Manuel Gonzalez to keep his son
Elian in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that this taste of freedom and the opportunity to be
with his son and to have this time perhaps would lead to that,''
the first lady said when asked about Cuban boy's case during a town
meeting broadcast nationwide by CNN from the University of Buffalo
before an audience of more than 350 people. ''But at the end of the
day this has to be the father's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also again defended the government's armed removal of
Elian from his Miami relatives, saying it was ''regrettable, but I
understand the necessity for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by CNN host Wolf Blitzer about her earlier pledge not to
run for president in four years, even if Republicans win the White
House this year, Clinton said: ''I am going to serve my six-year
term as senator. I owe it to the people of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also said that while she was a supporter of
abortion rights, she could support legislation backed by President
Clinton that would outlaw what critics call partial-birth abortion
except in cases where the woman's health or life was at stake. She
noted that congressional Republicans have refused to let that
legislation come up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came at the end of a long day on the campaign
trail in which she went from cow country to the college campus,
calling for tax changes to help keep family farms in the family and
accepting two offers to debate rival Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also said she had concerns about pursuing the
third party ballot line of the New York wing of the Reform Party
because of the possibility that she could be on a ticket headed by
conservative Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a very big difference with him on nearly every issue
you can imagine,'' Clinton told reporters after a speech to
Democrats in the Cattaraugus County community of Salamanca.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and the New York City mayor have both been
invited to a forum for Senate candidates Saturday in Buffalo by New
York's Independence Party. Giuliani has accepted while Clinton said
Wednesday that she is still ''working it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party is currently in the midst of a court
battle over its leadership with one faction supporting Buchanan and
the other adamantly opposed to his candidacy. Giuliani has also
spoken out repeatedly against Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
count votes received on third party ballot lines. That can make the
difference in close races.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady stopped in Salamanca on her way to Buffalo for
the televised town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has attended 76 town hall meetings in New York
City as mayor, is scheduled for his own nationally televised
college forum next week at the Rochester Institute of Technology
when he appears on MSNBC's ''Hardball'' with Chris Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   In Salamanca, Clinton said she had accepted invitations for two
televised debates in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman for Giuliani's campaign,
said the mayor had earlier accepted one of those debates and was in
discussions concerning the other. She said the mayor has made it
clear he wants debates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton wants to have it both ways and no way. She'd like
to debate, but apparently doesn't want the mayor there,'' Glover
Weiss said. ''We've offered to sit down to discuss mutually
feasible dates, but the Clinton campaign won't work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who had never lived in New York until she moved
to the state in January, said that her visit to Cattaraugus County
meant she has visited 56 of the state's 62 counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the end of tomorrow, I will have gone to 58 counties and
I'm trying to get to all 62'' before the Democratic state
convention on May 16, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's important that New York be represented in the
Senate by someone who will represent the entire state,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been making much of the fact that while she has been
crisscrossing the state for months, Giuliani has made only sporadic
forays outside the city, something that has drawn criticism for the
mayor even from his fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Starting her day in Letchworth state park beside the thundering
middle falls, Clinton seemed to press that point.
</P>
<P>
   ''You travel with me, you see New York,'' she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a stop at a dairy farm in Wyoming County, the first
lady called for increasing the estate tax exemption for family
farms and other family-owned businesses to $1.75 million, up from
the current $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ought to be able to leave your land and the bulk of your
fortunes to your children and not to the government,'' she told
more than 100 rural New Yorkers on hand for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton got a warm reception at the farm and at the Democratic
luncheon in Salamanca.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Democrats on hand in Salamanca were impressed by
what they heard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like the Clinton administration,'' said Pete Whalen,
who said he had driven from Bradford, Pa., to see the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the 48-year-old dentist offered something of a
compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's hot,'' Whalen said. ''She must have been a real babe 15
years ago ... Make that 10 years ago.''

<HEADLINE> LA Corruption Probe Tab To Top $17M  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- City and county governments will spend at
least $17.6 million next fiscal year investigating police
misconduct and improving police operations, a figure that officials
say could rise as the corruption probe grows.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate does not include either the $30 million Mayor
Richard Riordan has proposed setting aside for potential liability
arising from civil suits or the $2.7 million already spent this
year on the corruption investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press requested current and estimated costs from
the city and county departments involved in the investigation. Both
entities are beginning budget debates for the 2000-2001 fiscal
year, which begins July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing corruption probe centers on allegations that Los
Angeles Police Department officers falsified reports, lied under
oath, planted evidence and in some cases shot unarmed suspects. To
date, 67 convictions have been overturned and about 30 officers
have been relieved of duty, fired or suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The county is projecting additional costs from the scandal of
$6.5 million, including $3 million to the district attorney's
office and $3.5 million for public defender services, said Los
Angeles County Chief Administrative Officer David Janssen.
</P>
<P>
   The amount is just a fraction of the county's $15 billion
budget, but it represents more than 12 percent of the $48 million
the county expects to receive in additional revenue this year.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen said he would have preferred using the money to hire
additional Child Protective Services or mental health workers, as
well as adding sheriff's deputies and detectives to make up for
previous cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have all kinds programs that could use money,'' he said.
''It's a draw on the money that we obviously would prefer we didn't
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's projected expense in the next fiscal year for
investigating and cleaning up the police department is $11.1
million. That includes $1.4 million for the city attorney's office,
$6 million to implement improvements and $854,000 for the police
commission's review.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the costs, city programs aren't likely to be affected,
officials said. Revenues to the city budget are expected to be $150
million more than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about a $3 billion budget ... and the police
commission is about $1 million,'' said Councilman Mike Feuer,
chairman of a budget committee that began hearings Wednesday.
''It's a tiny percentage.''

Columbine Shooting Video Released
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Colorado authorities today made public video from last
year's Columbine High School massacre in which 14 students and one teacher were
slain. Some of the footage was set to a pop music soundtrack for the training of
police and fire personnel and showed the damaged cafeteria, bullet-riddled
classrooms and the library, where 10 students were killed. Jefferson County
District Attorney Frank Hutfless released the tapes to the victims' families
yesterday under a court order after a judge ruled that the relatives have an
''undeniable and compelling public interest'' in seeing the footage. Copies of
the video were made available for $25.

Elian's Father Seeks To Represent Son

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Juan Miguel Gonzalez's attorney today asked in an
emergency petition for the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to speak on behalf
of his 6-year-old son Elian ''...who has no other suitable representative.'' The
father asked the court to reject a bid by the boy's great-uncle and former
temporary guardian, Lazaro Gonzalez, to have his lawyers and doctors see the
Cuban refugee and speak for him before the court. The Justice Department also
opposed Lazaro's motion for a court-appointed guardian to examine and speak for
Elian.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush, addressing Washington's Republican elite
at a record-breaking $21 million fund-raiser, promised tonight to reach across
party lines and end a ''cycle of bitterness, an arms race of anger'' that
stymies progress in the nation's capital. ''I will set a different tone in

he said in a keynote speech. The crowd of 1,500 fell silent when Bush said both
parties are to blame for partisan mudslinging and gave him his loudest applause

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Online pet supply store Pets.com says the friendly
reputation of its kitschy ''spokespuppet'' has been defamed by a foul-mouthed
dog puppet featured on NBC's ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien.'' In a federal
lawsuit filed last week, Pets.com accuses ''Late Night'' writer Robert Smigel,
creator of the show's ''Triumph the Insult Comic Dog,'' of defaming the
ubiquitous sock puppet. Marc Liepis, a spokesman for ''Late Night,'' said
neither the show nor Smigel would comment on the lawsuit. But, he noted that the
cigar-smoking Triumph made his debut long before the arrival of the sock puppet.

Flood-Ravaged Mozambique Still Needy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Images of Mozambicans clinging to trees
above swirling floodwaters are already a fading memory, but their country now
faces a critical phase in its recovery, a top U.N. official said Wednesday. The
flood victims who were plucked to safety by helicopters have been returning to
their homes -- or what's left of them -- and need roads, bridges, schools and
hospitals rebuilt, said Mark Malloch Brown, head of the United Nations
Development Program. Torrential rains from two cyclones swept away the homes or
livelihoods of 10 percent of Mozambique's 19 million people last February.

power plant April 26, 1986 was the world's worst nuclear accident. Soviet
authorities tried to keep the disaster a secret but the aftereffects are grimly

poorly organized cleanup and 70,000 people disabled by radiation, according to
government figures.

scoreless innings to snap the New York Mets' nine-game winning streak with a
12-1 victory tonight. Dmitri Young went 4-for-5 with a homer and five RBIs, and
Ed Taubensee added three hits, a home run and three RBIs for Cincinnati, which
ended its longest losing streak since September 1998 and the Mets' longest
winning stretch since May 1998. But the story for the Reds was the performance
by Neagle (2-0), who had no trouble pitching on a rainy, 43-degree night.

<HEADLINE> Angola Humanitarian Plight Alarms UN  </HEADLINE>
By CASIMIRO SIONA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- Families driven from their homes by
Angola's civil war are eating worms and grass to survive, the
United Nations said Wednesday in a report that called the
humanitarian situation in the country alarming.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by the U.N. humanitarian office in Luanda,
said aid shipments must quickly be increased and thousands of
displaced people must be moved out of badly run temporary shelters
where sanitary conditions are terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important for the international community and the
government of Angola to react promptly if we are to avert the
current crisis from becoming a major humanitarian tragedy,''
Carolyn McAskie, deputy U.N. emergency relief coordinator, said in
statement released in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The report said some displaced people are being harassed by
government soldiers. Recent news reports have claimed soldiers are
stealing food aid from displaced people.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates the fighting has uprooted some 3.8
million people -- about one-third of the southwest African country's
population. Many of them are living in makeshift camps and almost
all rely on aid to survive.
</P>
<P>
   At increased risk are children, widows, and the handicapped.
''These groups are on the edge of an abyss,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Angola is fertile, but skirmishes between the army and
the UNITA rebels have forced civilians to flee to the major
government-held cities. Meanwhile, roads made dangerous by land
mines and ambushes have forced aid groups to distribute aid by air,
bringing a steep hike in the cost of operations.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations this year is asking donors for an estimated
$258 million for Angola, more than double last year's $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   Angola's civil war reignited in December 1998 after four years
of jittery peace under a U.N.-brokered peace accord. UNITA has said
it is prepared to negotiate a new peace deal. However, the
government has ruled out fresh talks, saying the rebels cannot be
trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Two previous peace deals also collapsed, the first one in 1992
when UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's first democratic
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The government and UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, began fighting after
the Southwest African country gained independence from Portugal in
1975.

<HEADLINE> OSHA Issues Lyme Disease Warning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration is warning outdoor workers to be especially wary of
Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Outdoor workers are at particularly high risk, and the tick
population may continue to increase this season due to the rising
number of deer and recent mild winters,'' David Weld, executive
director of the American Lyme Disease Foundation in Somers, N.Y.,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Occupations that carry a high risk of exposure to infected ticks
include construction work, landscaping, forestry, brush clearing,
land surveying, farming, railroad work, oilfield work, utility line
work and park/wildlife management.
</P>
<P>
   Rash, flu-like symptoms, arthritis and heart abnormalities are
some of the symptoms suffered by Lyme disease victims.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks, vaccinations and use of insect repellent are
preventive measures.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 11, Orioles 6  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Playing first base obviously agrees with Frank
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, back at the position for the first time since April 9,
hit a grand slam Wednesday night as the Chicago White Sox beat the
Baltimore Orioles 11-6.
</P>
<P>
   It was the seventh victory in eight games for the White Sox, who
are off to their best start since the 1973 club went 15-5.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' big homer overshadowed Harold Baines' 2,800th hit.
Baines, who played for the White Sox for almost 12 years and
already has his number retired by the club, reached the milestone
with a solo home run in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he likes it or not, Thomas has always put up better
numbers when he's playing first. He's a career .337 hitter at
first, compared with .290 as a designated hitter. He won both his
MVPs as an everyday first baseman. And his slump the last two
years? Came when he was primarily DHing.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas went back to first without complaint in spring training,
but moved to DH on April 11 because of tendinitis in his right
foot. Manager Jerry Manuel decided to put him back at first after
watching Thomas in a rundown Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw him scamper back and forth,'' Manuel said before the
game. ''I said, 'That looks like a big first baseman over there, he
can do some things.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas didn't disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   After Sidney Ponson (2-1) walked Jose Valentin to load the bases
in the bottom of the fourth, Thomas sent an 0-1 pitch rocketing
into left-center for the grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   It was his fifth homer of the year, and his first grand slam
since July 31, 1998, at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas finished 1-for-3 and had a sacrifice fly in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Fans gave him a standing ovation, and the White Sox ballboy
urged Thomas to come back out for a curtain call. He did, waving to
the crowd and smiling. He got another huge cheer as he ran onto the
field at the top of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson, who lost for the first time in six starts, gave up nine
runs -- eight of them earned -- on seven hits. Kip Wells (2-2) gave
up six runs on eight hits. Both pitchers gave up three home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee hit a three-run homer in the second and Herbert Perry
followed with a solo shot as Chicago took a 4-0 lead. It was the
first hit and homer in a Chicago uniform for Perry, who was claimed
off waivers Friday and made his first start Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore answered back with its own power surge in the third as
Delino DeShields hit a three-run homer. Mike Bordick hit a two-run
homer in the sixth, but it wasn't enough to match Thomas.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Thomas had some pretty good defense to go with his offense.
He got the first out of the game when he made a diving catch to
snag Brady Anderson's hopper. ... DeShields was charged with his
first error of the season when he bobbled a throw in the second
inning. ... Ray Durham drove in two runs.

<HEADLINE> Accused 1963 Church Bomber Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Texas (AP) -- A former Ku Klux Klansman considered a
suspect in a 1963 church bombing that killed four black girls in
Alabama was arrested in Texas on Wednesday on sexual assault
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Frank Cherry, 69, was arrested at his Mabank, Texas, home
on a fugitive from justice warrant. Cherry is wanted in Shelby
County, Ala., on five counts of sexual abuse, two counts of rape
and one count of sodomy, said Henderson County Deputy Troy Black.
</P>
<P>
   A former stepdaughter, Gloria LeDow, accused Cherry of molesting
her when they lived in Shelby County 29 years ago. LeDow told
reporters about the alleged abuse in July 1999 when she was in
Birmingham, Ala., to testify to a federal grand jury about the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby County, Ala., sheriff's officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry remained in the Henderson County Jail in Athens, Texas,
without bond Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry's attorney, Ronnie Van Baugh, did not return phone calls
from The Associated Press for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamite bomb planted outside the Sixteenth Street Baptist
Church exploded on the morning of Sept. 15, 1963, killing Denise
McNair, 11, and 14-year-olds Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson and
Addie Mae Collins. The bombing galvanized national awareness of
racial tension in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The initial federal investigation into the bombing resulted in
no charges. The FBI named four Klan members, including Cherry, as
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation in the 1970s resulted in the murder conviction
of Robert Edward Chambliss, who died in prison in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was reopened in 1997. Cherry and another
suspect, Thomas E. Blanton Jr., denied involvement before a federal
grand jury. Family members have testified they recall Cherry
boasting of participating in the church bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth suspect, Herman Cash, is dead.

<HEADLINE> One Killed in Texas Prison Brawl  </HEADLINE>
By PAM EASTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAMESA, Texas (AP) -- Racial tensions fueled fights between 300
black and Hispanic inmates at a West Texas prison that left one
inmate dead and five others in intensive care, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Some prisoners wielded garden tools in the five-hour melee
Tuesday night at the minimum- to medium-security Smith Unit, which
remained under lockdown Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it was very racially motivated,'' said Larry Todd,
a Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman. ''Some white
inmates jumped in the fight, but it was mostly the black and
Hispanic inmates who were fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   The fights began after a Hispanic inmate confronted a black
inmate who was fondling himself in front of a female officer in a
dining hall, said Larry Fitzgerald, also a Department of Criminal
Justice spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Word of their confrontation then spread throughout the unit, and
black and Hispanic inmates began brawling in the recreation yard.
</P>
<P>
   ''It started off with a small group fighting, and the guards got
that under control. Then another group got into one, and the fight
got bigger and bigger until it got to the point of a mass riot,''
said John Barton, spokesman for Warden Lupe Lozano.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 31 inmates were injured. The dead inmate was
identified as Fernando Trejo, 20, a convicted burglar. Trejo died
from stab wounds, and most of those injured also had been stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   Barton said some of the inmates' injuries were critical.
</P>

   Corrections officials said it took about 300 guards to subdue an
equal number of inmates. The guards used a pepper spray-like
substance; one suffered minor injuries from a gas grenade that went
off in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prison's kitchens was gutted by fire.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance came as the Texas Department of Criminal Justice
was auditing staffing patterns at the prison, following guards'
complaints about understaffing. The prison was designed to hold
1,276 prisoners but houses 1,322, Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said staffing was not a problem Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   All of the injured inmates will be returned from hospitals to
the prison and questioned. Some of them may be transferred to a
maximum-security prison, Todd said.

   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks slipped Thursday morning following a
retreat on Wall Street. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 8.18 points,
or 0.05 percent, to 18,126.13 at the end of the morning session. On
Wednesday, the average closed down 138.02 points, or 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.27 yen, up 0.39 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo and unchanged from its late New York level.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, Tokyo players remained cautious about
prospects for the U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investors can't move before seeing U.S. data later Thursday,''
said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government was to release data on that nation's
employment costs and gross domestic product for the first quarter
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 179.32 points
to 10,945.50 at Wednesday's close. The Nasdaq composite index
closed at 3,630.09 points, down 81.14.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 11.02 points, or 0.66 percent, to 1,656.87.
The TOPIX closed up 2.61 points, or 0.16 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, traders said some foreign investors bid up
the greenback against the yen in an attempt to cover losses in U.S.
stocks by selling Japanese shares.
</P>
<P>
   But trading was moderate ahead of the release of major economic
data in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 97.96 yen, up from
97.60 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7400 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7350 percent. Its
price fell 0.04 point to 100.51.
