<HEADLINE> 19 charged with drug trafficking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - Nineteen people involved in a drug
trafficking ring in the Utica area were arrested early Wednesday,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested are linked to 22 others picked up in May and
comprise ''a major cocaine, crack cocaine and marijuana
distribution organization,'' according to the U.S. Department of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a substantial distribution network'' that brought more
than three pounds of crack cocaine into Utica every week, said
First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Pavone.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the multi-agency law enforcement effort has accounted
for more than two kilograms of crack cocaine, seven pounds of
marijuana, several ounces of cocaine powder, 22 firearms and
$70,000 in cash, Pavone said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the drugs originate in New York City, said John M.
Winslow, FBI supervisory senior resident agent for Utica.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say the drug arrests will continue.

<HEADLINE> Thai Toyota Prices To Drop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Japanese carmaker Toyota plans to
reduce prices of vehicles made in Thailand in a bid to raise its
market share here, according to the president of its Thai
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiaki Muramatsu of Toyota Motor Thailand Co. told a news
conference late Wednesday that the company will be able to cut
prices of its locally produced vehicles by purchasing all of its
parts domestically. Local parts are less expensive than imports
from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to boost domestic market share to 35 percent from the
current 29 percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Motor Thailand uses about 80 percent domestic parts in
its pickups and 55 percent to 87 percent in its passenger car
models.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Eyes Foreign Investments  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT KEITH-REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Buoyed by the lifting of official warnings for
international visitors to stay away, Fiji's new government Thursday
announced incentives aimed at attracting foreign investment to help
repair economic damage caused by a May coup.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase's government announced economic
policies which include slashing corporate tax rates and other
measures to help businesses hard-hit by the coup and spur new
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The South Pacific island nation was plunged into chaos when
failed businessman George Speight led an armed gang into Parliament
on May 19, taking dozens of lawmakers hostage.
</P>
<P>
   A two-month standoff ended when Speight agreed to release his
hostages in return for the military, which took control of Fiji
after the coup, scrapping the 1997 constitution and installing a
new government stacked with nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Ousted Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry is seeking international
support for a campaign to declare Qarase's military-installed
government illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry was the first member of Fiji's ethnic Indian minority
to lead the country and his appointment following 1999 elections
crystallized opposition among indigenous Fijians to the growing
economic and political power of Indians, who make up 44 percent of
Fiji's 814,000 population.
</P>
<P>
   The sugar export- and tourism-dependent economy has been
devastated by the crisis -- the sugar harvest was frozen for weeks,
tourist numbers plummeted following civil unrest which targeted
several resorts, and Fiji's most important trading partners imposed
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Australia this week downgraded travel
advisories, noting that the security situation in Fiji has improved
since Qarase's government was appointed. Having earlier warned
their residents to stay out of Fiji, the two nations said visitors
should now maintain a high level of security awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Other incentives announced in the Cabinet document released
Thursday included investment allowances and accelerated
depreciation allowances for businesses, lower duties on
construction materials and capital items, and tax exemptions for
income from export sales.
</P>
<P>
   Full details of the concessions would be announced later, after
consultations with local business organizations, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Reserve Bank of Fiji predicted in its latest quarterly
review that economic growth would slump by 13 percent because of
the coup and could deteriorate further into ''the deepest
contraction since records were kept.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the coup, the bank predicted Fiji's economy would grow by
at least 4 percent in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Police hunt for female fugitive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME, N.Y. (AP) - A woman who may have witnessed the shooting of
two men escaped police custody Tuesday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Rivera, 20, was being held by state police in a
second-floor interview room when she slipped out of her handcuffs
and walked out, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera was one of four people stopped Tuesday in Rome in a car
matching the description of a vehicle containing witnesses to the
shooting of two Rome men in another car about 12:20 a.m. Tuesday in
Rockland County on the New York State Thruway.
</P>
<P>
   State police would not identify the shooting victims or their
conditions Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 86 grams of crack cocaine were found in the vehicle
pulled over in Rome, leading to drug charges against Rivera and
three others.
</P>
<P>
   The unsuccessful search for Rivera Tuesday night involved a
helicopter, dogs, state troopers, Rome police and officers from
other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   She is described as 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighing about 160
pounds and having long hair pulled back in a ponytail. She was last
seen wearing a white tank top, black bib overalls and no shoes.

<HEADLINE> Police arrest man thought to be involved in a string of violent robberies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A man arrested for attempting to burglarize an
Upper West Side home has been linked to a string of violent
robberies in the same neighborhood, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Van Baskerville, 32, was arrested just after midnight
Tuesday, while attempting to break into a ground floor home on West
95th Street, Detective Joseph Pentangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Baskerville, who appears to be homeless, closely matched witness
descriptions in seven other burglaries on the Upper West Side,
Pentangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of the robberies turned violent. Earlier this
month, a woman returned to her apartment on West 81st Street and
found her 57-year-old husband on the floor with a fractured skull.
</P>
<P>
   Last month an elderly couple was severely beaten when they
confronted a robber inside their town house on West 87th Street.
Just four days earlier, another elderly couple was beaten and
stabbed in their home on West 93rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Baskerville has past arrests for burglary and criminal trespass,
Pentangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged Wednesday night on a sole count of attempted
burglary, but will be questioned further and placed in a lineup for
witnesses, Pentangelo said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Arrives for L.A. Convention  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore was serenaded into the state where he
claimed the Democratic Party's top prize by a mariachi band and
cheering union loyalists Wednesday. ''I love California,'' he
exclaimed, predicting the road to victory was beginning here.
</P>
<P>
   A proud father first -- speechmaker second -- Gore scrapped plans
to spend a quiet evening polishing his own Democratic National
Convention address for Thursday and instead delighted his eldest
daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, by turning up on the podium after
her nominating speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gore waited outside in his limousine, listening to running mate
Joseph Lieberman's speech on the radio, so as to tip off Schiff,
27, before she spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats roared as father and daughter shared the stage, waving
to the rest of their family in a skybox.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was on the freeway in his limousine,
returning to his hotel for a family dinner, when the convention
roll call handed him the nomination that he was groomed for since
birth by his senator-father and sought only once before, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gore started his day in Burbank with wife Tipper, Lieberman and
his wife, Hadassah, and a crowd of hundreds waiting in the
smothering heat of a hangar at Burbank's Mercury Air Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the new guard and we're going to bring positive change
to the United States of America,'' Gore said, Air Force Two parked
at his back.
</P>
<P>
   ''The future starts in California. The victory starts in
California,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the vice presidential nominee-in-waiting who arrived
late Monday and was speaking to the convention Wednesday night,
called out that he'd been waiting for days to use this line: ''Will
you help me win one for the Tipper?''
</P>
<P>
   Having worked on the plane to polish his Thursday acceptance
speech, Gore told the crowd, which was filled out by members of the
Screen Actors Guild, that they could expect a chock-full accounting
of his plans for school improvements, a patients' bill of rights, a
hate crimes law, a Medicare prescription drug benefit, stricter gun
controls, environmental protections and more.
</P>
<P>
   His proposed Social Security reforms and $500-billion package of
tax cuts -- for education, long-term health care, retirement,
research and development, and other aims -- were to form the
centerpiece of the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke about the speech as he flew here from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a speech I have written. I will deserve the credit or
the blame. I've been rewriting and editing and tweaking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that those who watch and listen will feel afterward
that they have a clearer idea of exactly what I'm proposing to do.
They'll also know how the ideas and proposals I'm making are rooted
in the experiences that I've had,'' said Gore, who represented
Tennessee in Congress for 16 years before he was elected vice
president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he professed to be more anxious on his daughter's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, was delivering one of the night's
nominating speeches -- meant to be a deeply personal testimonial
about Gore as a dad and granddad.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got more butterflies about that than my own speech,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   But his chief strategist Carter Eskew made no bones about the
importance of Gore's speech on Thursday accepting the party's
presidential nomination. President Clinton's understudy of 7&AMP;frac12; years
is trying to introduce himself to the nation as a leader and his
own man.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is his main chance to be the main guy,'' said Eskew.
</P>
<P>
   After a party at Warner Brothers Studios with his homestate
Tennessee delegation and Lieberman's from Connecticut, Gore was to
have perfected and practiced his speech in his Century City hotel
suite -- far from downtown Los Angeles at the insistence of the
Secret Service, which was nervous about protesters near the
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he summoned his entourage for the surprise visit to
Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had already rehearsed at least parts of the speech with a
TelePrompTer.
</P>
<P>
   One person involved in the process described family ''bull
sessions'' where Gore, with his laptop in front of him, would read
brief sections aloud to Mrs. Gore, daughter Karenna and
brother-in-law Frank Hunger, consider their feedback and type in
revisions.
</P>
<P>
   In his limousine and on Air Force Two, the one-time newspaper
reporter would tap away on long rides between campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has, for months, swapped outlines and ideas with top aides
and supporters from Capitol Hill, organized labor and other
constituency groups. But spokesman Chris Lehane said Gore did the
bulk of the writing during the first week of this month -- when he
was ''on vacation'' at the North Carolina shore waiting out the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   One Gore ally said an unimpressed vice president graded GOP
presidential nominee George W. Bush's acceptance speech as
meatless, thus fueling Gore's intent to serve up on Thursday a full
menu of proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on playing down the role of professional wordsmiths,
Lehane described as mere ''sounding boards'' the team of former
White House speechwriter Eli Attie, who also helped write Karenna's
nominating speech; consultant Bob Shrum, who pens the flowery
turns-of-phrase; and Eskew, known to be deft at lacing poison darts
with sugar.

<HEADLINE> Russian Church Decries Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian Orthodox Church's highest body on
Wednesday closed a meeting highlighted by the decision to canonize
Czar Nicholas II.
</P>
<P>
   The Bishops' Council also adopted a social doctrine that
denounces the use of force in international affairs and that calls
for the end of the death penalty, according to Russian news
reports.
</P>
<P>
   The church opposes the death penalty not only because it can
make a judicial error irreparable but also because the penalty
causes controversy in society, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the decision to confer the lowest level of sainthood on
Nicholas, his wife Alexandra and their five children, the bishops
said the family died as martyrs to their faith when they were
executed by a Bolshevik firing squad on July 17, 1918.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Starts Democratic Journey  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The son of a bakery truck driver, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman said Wednesday night that ''only in America'' can a
working-class Jewish boy grow up to land a spot on a presidential
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is America a great country or what?'' the third-term senator
said with wonder to adoring Democrats. Their waving ''Lieberman''
signs turned the convention center into a blur of red.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional tribute to the nation's diversity and Al Gore's
potential, Lieberman mixed mentions of his faith and his politics,
saying, ''We have become the America that so many of our parents
dreamed for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Go Joe go! Go Joe go!'' the Democrats chanted, producing the
convention's most enthusiastic demonstration so far.
</P>
<P>
   After describing George W. Bush and Dick Cheney as ''decent and
likable men,'' Lieberman criticized the Republican ticket's
policies on schools, health care, Social Security, Medicare,
campaign finance reform and tax cuts. He said Gore-Lieberman would
continue the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's this simple -- we Democrats will expand the prosperity.
They will squander it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd erupted when he accused Republicans of stealing
Democratic themes with Oscar-winning acting. ''Our Republican
friends actually try to walk and talk a lot like us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman embraced affirmative action -- ''mend it, but please
don't end it'' -- after minority leaders had raised questions about
his past opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign quickly fired back. ''The more time Joe
Lieberman spends with Al Gore, the more partisan he gets and the
more his convictions change,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Ari
Fleischer in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said the ticket will ''renew the moral center of this
nation,'' a nod to the potential fallout from controversies in the
Clinton-Gore administration -- from impeachment to campaign finance
wrongdoings.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why I hope you will conclude -- as I have -- that for his
honesty, for his strength, for his integrity and for his character
Al Gore must become the next president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the names of four presidents, two Democrats and two
Republicans, Lieberman said they ''have reminded us we must as
Americans try to see our nation not just through our own eyes but
through the eyes of others.''
</P>
<P>
   To make that point, Lieberman was introduced by civil rights
hero and Georgia Rep. John Lewis as well as his wife, Hadassah,
daughter of Holocaust survivors. Lieberman, who was a freedom rider
registering black voters in the South, said, ''The people I have
met never forgot that in America every time a barrier is broken the
doors of opportunity open wider for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah, who called her husband ''My Joey,'' said Americans
should ''embrace our nation's diversity and celebrate our
differences.'' After the brief introduction, she welcomed her
husband to the stage with a hug and a kiss, then turned with him to
face adoring Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is America a great country, or what?'' Lieberman said. Barely
audible above the cheers, he added: ''God bless America, land that
we love.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked of his relationship with running mate Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have discussed -- sometimes even debated -- policy issues.
And we have shared private moments of prayer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, 58, said his late father grew up in an orphanage and
later drove a bakery truck before owning a package store in
Stamford, Conn. ''He taught us the importance of work and
responsibility. With my mother by his side, he saw me become the
first person in my family to graduate from college,'' Lieberman
said.
</P>
<P>
   With his mother, Marcia, looking on, Lieberman said, ''You and I
know how proud Pop would be tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes I try to see this world as my Dad saw it from his
bakery truck,'' Lieberman said. ''I know that somewhere in American
right now, there is another father loading a bakery truck, or a
young woman programming a computer, or a parent dreaming of a
better future for their daughter or their son. If we keep the
faith, then 40 years from now one of their children will stand
before a gathering like this with a chance to serve and lead this
country that we love.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that John F. Kennedy, the first Catholic to win the
presidency, accepted the Democratic nomination here 40 years ago
and said Americans of all faiths and creeds and classes can aspire
to the White House today.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let them look back to this time, and this place, and this
stage and say of us: they kept the faith. Let them say that we
helped them realize their hopes and their dreams,'' he said,
wrapping up the speech with an emotional flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ''And let them look around at this great and good nation that we
are all so blessed to share, and say: Only in America.

<HEADLINE> Tommy Lee Jones Endorses Al Gore  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE FEINSILBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In an affectionate nomination of his old
college roommate, actor Tommy Lee Jones told Democrats on Wednesday
of canoeing and hunting with Al Gore ''and chasing through the
woods with coon dogs in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend of 35 years, Jones gave an unusual endorsement at the
Democratic National Convention. It barely mentioned politics.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he recalled the friendship of two young men who roomed
together for four years at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Once neither of them could make it home for Thanksgiving, he
said, ''so we made a fire in the venerable old fireplace in our
room, wrapped a big turkey in a couple of rolls of tin foil, and
roasted it right there in our dorm.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, he said, could testify that was ''some of the most
ambitious cooking Al Gore has done since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's wife, sitting in the audience, laughed at that.
</P>
<P>
   Turning serious, Jones recalled other times -- the assassinations
of Martin Luther King Jr. and of Robert Kennedy ''and our country's
tragic involvement in Southeast Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember how Al struggled to hold on to his faith at a time
when it seemed like America was losing its way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Jones, star of movies and television, recalled
their youth in warm terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I visited Al in Middle Tennessee, we did the complicated
things you'd expect college students to do,'' he said, ''catching a
loose cow, going canoeing and hunting, and chasing through the
woods with coon dogs in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   He also recalled shooting pool and watching Star Trek when they
should have been studying.
</P>
<P>
   Others will talk of affairs of state, Jones said with a straight
face. For him the big issues concerning Gore were these: ''Are they
feeding him well? And will the stress of the job hurt him?''
</P>
<P>
   He answered his own questions: ''He has sense enough to eat well
-- and the stress is no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he said, ''I nominate my friend Al Gore as the next
president of the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Karen Ejected From 'Big Brother'  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- She wanted it. She begged for it. She got it.
</P>
<P>
   Karen, the often-emotional mother of four, was plucked from the
''Big Brother'' house on Wednesday's live broadcast of the CBS
reality series, which airs the residents' behavior six nights a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing and crying on hearing the news, she hugged her
housemates and wished them well, then made her exit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what she wanted,'' college student Eddie told the others
who were left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The object of ''Big Brother'' is to stay in the house, not
leave. But on a past episode, Karen had pleaded with viewers to
spring her with their phoned-in votes, so she could rejoin her
children back home in Columbus, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   She got her wish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ecstatic,'' said Karen, weeping as she joined host Julie
Chen in the Los Angeles studio beside the house. ''I get to see my
kids. That's all I wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted the experience (in the house), and I got it, and now
I just want to be a mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Karen reunited with her kids after 43 days'
absence, she was also confronted during the show by Tom, her
husband of 22 years, about whom she had spoken harshly to her
housemates (and millions of viewers). They hugged and kissed.
</P>
<P>
   Seven houseguests remain in the camera- and microphone-bugged
house now that Karen has met the same fate as former stripper
Jordan two weeks ago, and youth counselor William, who was kicked
out July 19.
</P>
<P>
   The last remaining houseguest when the series concludes in
September will win a half-million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Karen and her housemates each nominated two
members to be expelled. In a tie vote, Karen was one of three
marked for banishment.
</P>
<P>
   After that, viewers got in the act. In a phone poll, 76 percent
of callers chose Karen to be ousted. Cassandra, a United Nations
communication officer, was picked by 15 percent. Civil engineering
student Josh got 9 percent. CBS does not divulge how many people
phoned in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Brother,'' which premiered on July 5, airs every night but
Sunday. But unlike Wednesday's live, hour-long broadcast, the other
installments feature half-hour, taped highlights.
</P>
<P>
   CBS also maintains a ''Big Brother'' Web site, where the
houseguests can be viewed in real time in streaming video.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Daughter Speaks at DNC  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore's eldest daughter showed Americans a
human side of him Wednesday -- a dad never too busy with politics to
play with his children.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not asking you to support Al Gore because he is my father,
or even because he's been a great dad,'' Karenna Gore Schiff told
the Democratic National Convention. ''What really matters is what
he will do for all our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Dad is a man of faith in the most gutsy, practical sense. He
wants to see goodness prevail,'' an animated Schiff said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Gore walked on stage, to the delight of the crowd,
and gave his daughter a bear hug. They walked off arm-in-arm as the
crowd roared, and mom Tipper applauded from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Working on the theory that one reason her father -- the vice
president and Democratic presidential aspirant -- is lagging in the
polls is because Americans don't know the real man, Schiff's goal
was to humanize a candidate best known as a stiff policy wonk.
</P>
<P>
   So Schiff, 27 and herself mother of a 13-month-old, highlighted
the role family plays in Gore's life and shared stories of the kind
of father he has been to his four children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's own parents -- Albert Gore Sr. and Pauline -- taught their
son ''about the dignity working people have,'' Schiff said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, his father's family were small farmers; his mother
worked her way through college, becoming one of the first women to
graduate from Vanderbilt Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ''My grandparents taught my dad that it is right to treat every
woman and man with equal respect; to call them Sir or Ma'am; to do
your own physical labor and clean up your own mess,'' Schiff said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, those lessons still resonate, she said. ''He believes in
taking the hard road when that's the road that will take us to
higher ground. And I think his old-fashioned politeness is
refreshing in today's world.''
</P>
<P>
   She offered glimpses of Gore as everyday dad, getting a laugh
when she revealed what he made his kids for breakfast every day --
toast. With lots of butter.
</P>
<P>
   After a big snowfall, the Gores taught their children how to
build an igloo, she said -- as delegates from Alaska cheered.
Karenna and a friend wanted to spend the night in it. Gore bundled
up the kids, ferried hot chocolate out to the igloo and ''welcomed
us like adventurers back from the North Pole'' when ''we ended up
waddling back inside, our lips blue from the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff is one of her father's top political advisers and his
ambassador to the young Generation X voters who she calls crucial
to the November election. So she couldn't resist adding some of
Gore's policy stands to the personal profile.
</P>
<P>
   He's for affordable health care, equal pay for equal work,
fighting big polluters, she said. On abortion, ''I believe in every
woman's right to choose, and I know my father will always, always
defend it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope, for the sake of our country and our future, that my
father is elected president. But I want you to know to me, he's
already won. For he has been the most wonderful father in the whole
world,'' she concluded.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Tries To Calm Liberals  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Introducing himself to America, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman is struggling to stretch across the political spectrum to
mobilize support for Al Gore. Before he gets too far, though, he
has to work on fellow Democrats first.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after being picked as Gore's running mate, Lieberman is
still trying to reassure blacks, teachers, unions and others that
his centrist views are compatible with theirs. Blacks question his
commitment to affirmative action, for example, while teachers are
unhappy about Lieberman's support for school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   It's crucial for Lieberman and Gore to consolidate the base of
Democratic voters because it is not unified now. Behind in the
polls, the Democrats have to turn out their core constituencies at
very high levels to beat Republicans George W. Bush and Dick
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lieberman has to assure some of the people on the far left
that he's not too conservative and go to the middle where the votes
are,'' said American University political scientist James Thurber.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lieberman has to indicate that he's going to be a positive
part of the team in the Gore administration and we're not going to
have to be attacking him,'' says Rep. John Conyers of Michigan,
senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. He said
Lieberman's selection makes it harder to get blacks to go to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night Lieberman took a star turn at the Democratic
National Convention, accepting the Democratic vice presidential
nomination and hoping to excite voters about his role on the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   He reached wide with an appeal aimed at every shade of Democrat.
He said he marched with civil rights leader Martin Luther King in
the 1960s, registered black voters in the South and believed that
when it comes to affirmative action his philosophy is, ''mend it,
but please don't end it.'' He promised better schools and health
care to every child in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing most Americans know about Lieberman is he is the
first Jew to run on a major party presidential ticket. The second
most trumpeted description is that he was the first Senate Democrat
to scold President Clinton for his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation for moral rectitude makes Lieberman a foil for
Republican promises to restore decency and integrity to the White
House. But Lieberman has caused some anxiety by his frequent
references to religion and values. Some Democrats wish he'd tone it
down.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy broke a religion barrier when he became the
first Roman Catholic elected president. Lieberman hopes to follow
as the first of his faith.
</P>
<P>
   In polls, eight out of 10 people say the country is ready for a
Jewish vice president and nine out of 10 say they personally could
vote for a Jewish candidate. However, pollsters caution that bias
is hard to find since people tend to give socially acceptable
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Like the candidate himself, convention speakers are trying to
broaden the picture of Lieberman's life and ease anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on opening night recalled that Lieberman in
the 1970s had been ''a freedom rider, going into danger to register
black voters in the then-segregated South.'' That was intended to
perk the ears of liberals and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's next remarks reached for moderates and independents.
''It's no surprise Al Gore picked the leader of the New Democrats
to be his vice president,'' the president said. ''Joe Lieberman has
supported all our efforts to reform welfare, reduce crime, protect
the environment and grow the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   A night later, Jesse Jackson said that in selecting Lieberman,
Gore had ''brought the sons and daughters of slaves and
slavemasters, together with the sons and daughters of Holocaust
survivors.'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy invoked the memory of his slain
brother and said JFK would be proud that Democrats were breaking
''the new barrier of bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny of Lieberman's background and positions is the same
ordeal that Cheney went through when Bush picked him. It's a kind
of political hazing that all running mates encounter. Bush's father
squirmed in 1980 when he was grilled about calling Ronald Reagan's
program ''voodoo economics.'' Cheney took heat for his conservative
voting record.
</P>
<P>
   After a few days in the headlights, vice presidential candidates
tend to fade into the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know what Woodrow Wilson said about the vice presidency?''
said Boston University presidential historian Robert Dallek.
''There's nothing to say about the vice presidency. And after
you've said that, there's nothing more to say.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's Al Gore who's got to convince the base of the party to
get out there and work for him, to vote and be committed,'' Dallek
said.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Uses Humor To Win Voters  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Did you hear the one about Joe Lieberman's
kosher Latino restaurant?
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before about 200 Hispanics Wednesday, Lieberman
quickly won the crowd over with a story about how he and California
Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a friend, one night mused that they could
combine their respective ethnic cuisines and open a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we passed the time, we started to think up dishes,'' the
vice presidential candidate said to howling laughter. ''One was
matzoh menudo, and one other I remember is gefilte fish ceviche.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Contreras, 46, a secretary from Union City, Calif.,
practically doubled over laughing. ''He's so funny. I feel like I
know him. I'd seen him before, but I never met him. I was very
impressed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he goes, whenever he campaigns, Lieberman -- known as
the sober centrist who chastised President Clinton for
''embarrassing'' the country -- tries to connect with people in much
the same way a lot of other famous Jewish Americans have, with
humor.
</P>
<P>
   And while he's no Jackie Mason or Jerry Seinfeld, Lieberman
loves to expose his funny bone. He often makes a face, opening his
mouth wide with a smile that says this is the punch line.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood with awe before thousands of Democrats to accept his
party's nomination for vice president, he thanked his wife for her
support and then deadpanned, ''There's an old saying that behind
every successful man, there is a surprised mother-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   He later chided Republicans over their convention last week,
essentially saying they were trying to imitate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may be near Hollywood, but not since Tom Hanks won an
Oscar, has there been that much acting in Philadelphia,'' said
Lieberman. Hanks won the 1993 Oscar for best actor for his role in
the movie ''Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, talking to a group of more than 100 gays and
lesbians at a caucus meeting Wednesday, he had mimicked his
parents: ''When I went into politics, my parents said, 'You can a
making a living from this?''' The accent was pure East Coast
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   When he welcomed running mate Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, to
Los Angeles, before a crowd at the Burbank Airport, he played off a
famous line from Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been waiting for a week to say this and I can't control
myself anymore. In this election, will you help me win this one for
the Tipper?''
</P>
<P>
   And when he and Gore met with hometown supporters from
Connecticut and Tennessee at the Warner Brothers Studios, he
reminded the crowd that the television show, ''The West Wing'' --
the fictionalized White House drama -- is filmed there.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did you know that?'' he asked, warming them up for the punch
line. ''If you and I work hard, the closest George Bush will get to
the west wing is the remote control!'' Lieberman said, again to
laughter.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 4, Devil Rays 3  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The Red Sox broke out of an offensive slump in the
seventh inning as Carl Everett's two-run single highlighted a
three-run rally that gave Boston a 4-3 win over the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight game, the Red Sox failed to score in the
first five innings. But they took advantage of relievers Paul
Wilson (0-2) and Doug Creek after Ryan Rupe left the game with a
2-1 lead after six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cox went 3-for-4, needing just a double to hit for the
cycle, and scored Tampa Bay's first two runs with a triple in the
second and his eighth homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Former Devil Ray Rolando Arrojo (2-1) allowed just one other
hit, a single by Miguel Cairo, in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe got the last four outs for his 27th save in 32
chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored fewer than five runs for the 15th time in
their last 22 games and, after the sixth inning, were 3-for-18 with
runners in scoring position starting with Tuesday night's 3-1 loss
to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Rupe struck out four and allowed a walk and seven hits before
leaving. It didn't take Wilson long to get in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out Jason Varitek to start the seventh, he
allowed a pinch single to Scott Hatteberg and a walk to Jose
Offerman. Creek came in and loaded the bases when pinch-hitter
Bernard Gilkey singled.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who had just 10 hits in his previous 45 at bats, gave
Boston the lead with his single to center. That moved Gilkey to
third, and manager Jimy Williams sent Darren Lewis in to run for
him.
</P>
<P>
   The move paid off after Nomar Garciaparra was walked
intentionally as Lewis scored on Troy O'Leary's sacrifice fly to
left, sliding under the attempted tag of catcher John Flaherty.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Devil Rays, the Red Sox ran into trouble when they went
to their bullpen. Rod Beck started the eighth by striking out
Gerald Williams. Cairo singled before Greg Vaughn struck out, but
Fred McGriff's single sent Cairo to second.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe replaced Beck and allowed an RBI single by Cox. The threat
ended when Jose Guillen struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Cox had given Tampa Bay the lead when he tripled in the second
and scored on Guillen's groundout. After Cox's homer made it 2-0,
Boston scored in the bottom of the sixth on O'Leary's triple and
Brian Daubach's single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Garciaparra has struggled since one of his closest friends,
3B Lou Merloni, was recalled from Pawtucket of the International
League on Monday. In the infielders' three games since then,
Garciaparra is 1-for-10, while Merloni is 6-for-11. ... Offerman
returned to Boston's lineup after a stint on the disabled list with
a bruised left knee and went 1-for-4. ... Tampa Bay SS Felix
Martinez is in a 3-for-35 slump after going 0-for-2. ... Rupe has
won his last four decisions, one less than the team record set last
season by Wilson Alvarez.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Williams Told Knee Is Fine  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona defensive back Aeneas Williams
got the news he wanted to hear when he went to Colorado for a
second opinion on his sore left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The trip home, though, was like something out of the movie
''Planes, Trains and Automobiles.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-time Pro Bowl cornerback traveled to Vail, Colo., on
Tuesday for an examination by noted knee specialist Dr. Richard
Steadman. As was the case in the initial exam by Cardinals team
doctor Russell Chick, nothing serious was detected.
</P>
<P>
   ''The doctor sent me down here and told me to go help lead the
team to Tampa,'' Williams said after practice Wednesday. ''I said
'God bless you, sir, for those kind words.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was when Williams left Steadman's office that things got
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ''My doctor appointment took longer and I missed all the flights
out of Vail,'' Williams said. ''So I stopped at a gas station to
see if I could get on a Greyhound to get to Denver. I had to return
my car to the airport, hitchhike a ride from the airport to the gas
station, and caught a Greyhound to Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   His scheduled 10:27 p.m. flight from Denver to Phoenix was
canceled. But he was able to get on an 8:30 flight that had been
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''So it's been a lot of fun,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it didn't take him long to catch a ride while
hitchhiking.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the guys recognized me,'' Williams said.
''Unfortunately, he was from Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Steadman agreed with Chick's diagnosis that Williams' injury was
only a bruised knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything checked out fine,'' Williams said. ''It went real
well. It wasn't anything I ever thought was serious. I just wanted
to get a second opinion. Dr. Steadman assured me I'll be ready to
try to take this team to the Super Bowl in Tampa.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was a full-scale participant in Wednesday's practice,
but coach Vince Tobin said he might hold him out of Friday night's
preseason game at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's fine. If we didn't play it would be only as a
precautionary measure,'' Tobin said. ''They say one thing that
heals it the quickest is rest, and we very well could rest him this
week.''

<HEADLINE> State pauses to watch favorite son accept nomination  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. (AP) - In bars and gathering places across
Connecticut Wednesday, people watched Joe Lieberman accept the
Democratic nomination for vice president with everything from
raucous enthusiasm for a native son to apathetic indifference.
</P>
<P>
   At Tycoons Restaurant in New Haven, near Lieberman's home, local
Democrats cheered as if a University of Connecticut championship
game was on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a vintage Joe Lieberman speech - thoughtful, humane and
persuasive, with moments of quick wit that only those of us who
know Joe so well are familiar with,'' said state Sen. Martin
Looney, D-New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons doubled over Lieberman's jokes, and gave him a standing
ovation each time he made a point.
</P>
<P>
   In Bob Oliver's opinion, ''it was one of the greatest speeches
I've ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he got his message across in a strong and yet humorous
manner,'' said the New Haven attorney.
</P>
<P>
   But about 40 miles east, at G. Willikers bar in Groton, the
crowd was less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody asked me to turn it on and nobody is watching it now,''
said bartender Debbie Dousis. ''Talking about politics in a bar can
get pretty heated, so we usually don't talk about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was similar at the VFW Post 9452 in Preston.
</P>
<P>
   I'm more interested in the Yankees game,'' said Jason Benoit of
Norwich. ''As long as the country is run right, it doesn't matter
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Windsor Locks, businessmen took in the speech at the Cloud
Nine Lounge inside the Shereton Hotel at Bradley Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very excited about it,'' said George Tomljanovic of
Bristol, who settled into the bar for a drink after returning from
a business trip. ''Joe is a very strong candidate coming from a
political background in the past. Religion doesn't play a role in
my perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   But Manuel Riguero, from Miami, didn't think Lieberman would be
a big factor in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody cares,'' Riguero said. ''The vice
president is a dead issue. Vice presidents don't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And although he admires Lieberman's character and commitment to
his religion, Randy Aman of Atlanta, said he fears what will become
of the senator's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he is going to be polluted by the Clinton/Gore
influence,'' Aman said. ''The poor guy is going to get sucked into
the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   In Milford, Democrat Peter Hastings was more encouraged as he
watched the speech at Archie Moore's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the fact that he talks about people,'' the engineer
said. ''It seems to me that a lot of politicians forget that
government is the people. He talked about his parents and his wife,
real roots.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 10, Marlins 4  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The struggling Los Angeles Dodgers erupted for
seven runs in the eighth inning, including Dave Hansen's
tiebreaking two-run triple, to rally past the Florida Marlins 10-4
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who lost eight of their previous 10 games, blew a
3-1 lead before coming back. Pinch-hitter Adrian Beltre capped the
outburst in the eighth with a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   F.P. Santangelo had three of the Dodgers' 11 hits and scored
three times.
</P>
<P>
   Ismael Valdes pitched well in place of Chan Ho Park, who came
down with flulike symptoms and was scratched from his scheduled
start. Valdes, who started despite pitching one inning in relief
Tuesday, went five innings and left with a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers trailed 4-3 when Tom Goodwin led off the eighth
with an infield single against Dan Miceli (5-3). Santangelo was hit
by a pitch, and Gary Sheffield's single loaded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Todd Hundley's RBI groundout tied the score, and
Hansen followed with a two-out triple into the right-field corner.
He scored on Chad Kreuter's single, Alex Cora greeted Vic
Darensbourg with a single, and Beltre hit his 12th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams (5-4) earned the victory despite giving up an
unearned run that put Florida ahead in the seventh. He retired the
first two batters before loading the bases, and when a fastball to
Preston Wilson sailed inside and deflected off catcher Kreuter's
glove, Luis Castillo scored on the passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millar hit a two-run homer for the Marlins. A.J. Burnett
allowed four hits and three runs in seven innings, but remained
winless since July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Each team was guilty of sloppy defense and had three players
thrown out on the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins manager John Boles was ejected by second base umpire
Mark Hirschbeck for arguing a call that ended the sixth inning.
With one out and Mark Smith at first, Dave Berg hit a deep fly that
right fielder Shawn Green caught. Smith, who rounded second,
returned to first but was called out for failing to touch second
again on his way back.
</P>
<P>
   Boles argued at length, then received a standing ovation from
the crowd of 11,855 when he finally walked off the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers broke a 1-1 tie in the sixth. Santangelo hit a
broken-bat blooper that landed on the foul line for an RBI double,
and later came home on Sheffield's grounder to make the score 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Berg singled home the Marlins' first run in the second. Green
tied the score with a sacrifice fly in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Castro missed becoming the first Marlins catcher to homer
this year by a foot, hitting a drive off the top of the
26&AMP;frac12;-foot-high scoreboard in the fifth. Left fielder Sheffield
caught the ball barehanded on the carom and threw out Castro trying
to stretch the hit into a double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Beltre's pinch-hit homer was the seventh by the Dodgers
this season and the second in as many nights. ... Top Marlins
pitching prospect Josh Beckett, who is with Class A Kane County,
was placed on the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis in his right
biceps. ... Marlins left fielder Cliff Floyd, sidelined since
undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery July 29, hopes to rejoin the
lineup by Aug. 25. ... Henry Rodriguez went 0-for-2 against Valdes
and is 2-for-21 lifetime against the right-hander. ... Burnett
faced the Dodgers for the first time since beating them in his
major league debut a year ago -- Aug. 17, 1999.

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Dave McCarty broke a 13 at-bat hitless streak
by going 3-for-4 with three RBIs as the Kansas City Royals snapped
a seven-game losing streak at the Metrodome with an 9-3 win over
the Minnesota Twins on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Sanchez and Hector Ortiz added three hits apiece, and Mark
Quinn homered as the Royals got 16 hits to back Brian Meadows
(2-0).
</P>
<P>
   Meadows, making his third appearance since coming over from San
Diego in a trade last month, allowed three runs and six hits in
eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City took a 1-0 lead on McCarty's 10th homer, before
scoring four runs off J.C. Romero (2-2) in the third inning.

<P>
   Johnny Damon led off with a single, stole second and went to
third on Sanchez's bunt single. Mike Sweeney reached on first
baseman Ron Coomer's error, allowing Damon to score.
</P>
<P>
   After a walk to Jermaine Dye loaded the bases, Joe Randa had an

loss, the Twins remain above .500 since the All-Star break with a
17-15 record.

<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston hit six home runs for the second time in
four days and Moises Alou hit his fifth home run in four games as
the Astros outlasted the Pittsburgh Pirates 11-10 on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton won his fourth straight decision and for the ninth
time in 10 decisions, and the Astros took over the National League
home-run lead with 188.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' six home runs gave them three more than the St.
Louis Cardinals this season. The Astros have hit six home runs
three times in team history, all this season, including Sunday
against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton (13-4) allowed five runs and eight hits in 7 1-3 innings
to improve to 7-1 at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Truby hit a three-run homer in the fourth inning to break
a 2-2 tie. It was the rookie third baseman's seventh home run of
the year, six coming in his last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Houston swept the three-game series and has won four straight,
scoring 46 runs in that span. The Astros are 18-16 since the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Serafini (1-2) lasted 4 1-3 innings, giving up seven runs on
six hits, four of them home runs.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Pirates' fourth straight loss and eighth in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Berkman's two-out home run to right opened the scoring in
the second inning. His 17th home run of the year was only his
second against a left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Brian Giles hit his 28th home run with Jason
Kendall on to give the Pirates a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell hit his 35th home run in the fourth inning to tie
it 2-2. Truby then hit his three-run homer to make it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning, Tim Bogar hit his third home run, driving
in Julio Lugo for a 7-2 lead. Alou followed with his 23rd home run,
off Bronson Arrojo, making it 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   Lugo added a two-run homer in the sixth, his fourth home run
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Young's RBI single drove in Adrian Brown in the eighth,
and Enrique Wilson walked with the bases loaded to cut it to 11-4
and finish Elarton. Warren Morris' RBI groundout off reliever Marc
Valdes scored Young.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Osik added a two-run double in the ninth off Valdes and
pinch-hitter Alex Ramirez hit a three-run homer off Octavio Dotel,
who got the final two outs for his seventh save in nine chances.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Houston's Brian Powell developed a stiff right shoulder
since his last start and will miss his scheduled start Saturday.
Chris Holt will move up from Sunday to take that start. ... Bagwell
extended his hitting streak to 15 games with his homer...
Serafini's win over the Giants on August 5 is one of only two
victories for Pirates starters this month. ... The last time
Pittsburgh allowed six home runs was April 17, 1974, at the Chicago
Cubs. The home runs Wednesday were two short of the club-record
eight allowed against Milwaukee on Aug. 30, 1953.

<HEADLINE> Ex-TCU Football Player Flowers Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMARILLO, Texas (AP) -- Clyde Eugene Flowers, a two-way tackle
and two-time All-Southwest Conference selection at Texas Christian
in the 1940s, died Tuesday. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers, who lived in Houston since 1950, played for TCU from
1940 to 1944 and was elected captain of the team his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of his teammates went to fight in World War II,
Flowers was exempted from the draft for health reasons and stayed
behind. The Horned Frogs were left with mostly inexperienced
recruits and finished 2-6 in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, the Horned Frogs had Flowers, two other seniors -- one
of whom had never played football -- and eight freshmen. Flowers
served as a player-coach that season and the team won the Southwest
Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers was selected All-Southwest Conference in 1943 and 1944.
He played in the 1943 East-West Shrine Game in San Francisco and in
the 1944 College All-Star game in Chicago. Flowers was inducted
into the TCU Hall of Fame in 1977 and into the Panhandle Sports
Hall of Fame in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   He was a longtime employee of American Coatings, a Houston paint
business.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Betty, two sons and a daughter,
seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Services will be at 10 a.m. Thursday at Woodlawn Funeral Home
Chapel in Houston.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Mamadou Diallo scored his third goal of the
game in overtime as the Tampa Bay Mutiny beat the New York-New
Jersey MetroStars 4-3 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, who has an MLS-best 22 goals after his first career hat
trick, scored from close range with just over four minutes left in
the second overtime. He is fifth player in league history -- and the
first since Stern John in 1998 -- to reach 20 goals in a season.
</P>
<P>
   New York-New Jersey's Alex Comas had tied in the 85th minute
with his second goal of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ralston put the Mutiny up 3-2 in the 70th minute.
</P>
<P>
   New York-New Jersey took a 2-0 first-half lead on goals by Comas
in the 21st minute and Adolfo Valencia in the 43rd. Diallo tied it
with goals in the 45th and 61st.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia, who has a team-best 14 goals, has scored three times
in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   New York-New Jersey goalkeeper Mike Ammann is expected to miss
the rest of the season after breaking three ribs.
</P>
<P>
   MetroStars general manager Nick Sakiewicz said Ammann also has a
concussion. Ammann, who did not break his jaw as originally feared,
will spend the night at St. Joseph's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ammann dived to beat Diallo to a loose ball in the 29th minute.
As Diallo jumped over the goalkeeper, his right foot struck
Ammann's head.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars were without midfielders Roy Myers (Costa Rica)
and Tab Ramos (United States) because of national team commitments.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- New York-New Jersey goalkeeper Mike Ammann is
expected to miss the rest of the season after breaking three ribs
Wednesday night against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   After New York-New Jersey's 4-3 overtime loss, MetroStars
general manager Nick Sakiewicz said Ammann also has a concussion.
Ammann, who did not break his jaw as originally feared, will spend
the night at St. Joseph's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ammann dived to beat Tampa Bay forward Mamadou Diallo to a loose
ball in the 29th minute. As Diallo jumped over the goalkeeper, his
right foot struck Ammann's head.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a mugging,'' Sakiewicz said. ''Good strikers pull up or
jump. We didn't see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo said he hopes to visit Ammann on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so, so sorry about that,'' Diallo said. ''At the time, I
was ready to kick the ball. I want to talk with Mike and tell him
how bad I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury could leave the MetroStars without an experienced
goalkeeper for the postseason. Backup Tim Howard has been selected
for the U.S. Olympic team and will leave in early September.
</P>
<P>
   MetroStars coach Octavio Zambrano said his team could end the
season using two A-League goalkeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see another option at this moment,'' Zambrano said.
</P>
<P>
   New York-New Jersey is in first place in the Eastern Division.

<HEADLINE> Helton Downplays Flirting With .400  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Todd Helton might not think so, yet he could be
the right hitter in the perfect era in the ideal stadium to become
the first player in 59 years to hit .400.
</P>
<P>
   Helton's .395 -- the highest anyone has been this late in the
season since George Brett was batting over .400 in September 1980.
Brett finished at .390 in his bid to become the first major leaguer
to reach the magic mark since Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one's hit .400 for nearly 60 years,'' said Helton, who has
gone 18-for-28 on the first eight games of Colorado's road trip to
raise his average 17 points. ''The media makes a big deal about it,
but I believe it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no one has had such ideal circumstances to do it in,
either. To hit .400, you should be left-handed, draw walks, play in
an offense-inflated era and have a home ballpark suited to your
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Helton has all of that -- especially the ballpark. There has
never been a stadium more suited to hitting than Coors Field, with
its spacious gaps and thin air.
</P>
<P>
   Helton is hitting .435 at home and, with 25 of his final 42
games at Coors Field, .400 suddenly becomes a much more realistic
possibility. On the road, he's at .357.
</P>
<P>
   But would it be tainted, with half his games coming in a stadium
where the average hitter is batting .332 this season? Not according
to teammate Larry Walker, who took a .400 average deep into July
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a major league player playing in a major league ballpark
in a major league city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who once started at quarterback ahead of Peyton Manning
at Tennessee, has clearly made the right choice in which career
path to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old leads the National League in batting, slugging,
on-base percentage, runs scored, hits, doubles, and total bases.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't talk enough about Todd Helton,'' teammate Jeff Cirillo
said. ''It's mind-boggling. You keep waiting for him to come down
to earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton is a frightening sight for pitchers. He stares them down
before he even comes to the plate -- standing a few feet closer to
home plate than the on-deck circle. He has a straight-up stance and
a high right-leg kick to time that sweet left-handed swing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a great hitter,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ''He
covers all pitches and all speeds. He uses all fields. He has great
balance. He's mechanically sound.''
</P>
<P>
   There are few -- if any -- weaknesses in his swing. In Tuesday's
doubleheader against the Mets, Helton hit line drives down both
foul lines and to straightaway center field.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to hit any pitch to any field makes Helton
impossible to defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''You make great pitches and the guy still hits them hard,''
said Mets right-hander Bobby J. Jones, who did manage to get Helton
out twice: once on a drive to the right-field wall and once a
screaming liner to center field.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is certainly not alone is his bewilderment. There is no
easy answer to pitching to Helton.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Montreal manager Felipe Alou had it right when he said he
wished Helton walked whenever he was up. Because throwing strikes
sure isn't the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Helton is hitting .423 when he swings at the first pitch and a
staggering .462 when he hacks at an 0-2 offering.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kid is swinging the bat as well as anyone I've ever
seen,'' said Rockies manager Buddy Bell, who has spent more than 30
years in professional baseball. ''This is a very hard game to play
and Todd Helton is making it look easy.''

<HEADLINE> Brewers 5, Reds 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jeff D'Amico earned his seventh straight
victory and Richie Sexson homered for the second straight game as
the Milwaukee Brewers completed their first sweep of the Cincinnati
Reds with a 5-1 victory Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson, playing in his 16th game since being acquired from
Cleveland, hit the first pitch from Rob Bell (5-7) for his fifth
homer following a two-out single by Geoff Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   That was all D'Amico (9-4) needed in boosting his record to 7-0
with a 1.15 ERA in his last nine starts. He scattered eight hits
and two walks in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico allowed a run in the fifth on Dante Bichette's two-out
double over the head of center-fielder Marquis Grissom.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers had a chance to add to their lead in the fifth after
D'Amico led off the inning with his second major league hit, a
double over the head of Ken Griffey Jr. in center field.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico was safe at third as Ron Belliard reached on a sacrifice
bunt that also was a fielder's choice. Two outs later, Scott
Sullivan walked Sexson before getting Jeromy Burnitz on a called
third strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers made it 3-1 in the sixth. Charlie Hayes singled and
with one out Luis Lopez was hit by a pitch. Both advanced on an
error by Sullivan on a pickoff throw before an attempted suicide
squeeze by D'Amico went awry as Hayes was tagged out at the plate
by catcher Jason LaRue. Belliard's bloop single scored Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams squandered several scoring chances and the Reds
stranded two runners in each of the second through fourth innings
before leaving the bases loaded in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers added two insurance runs in the eighth on an RBI
single by pinch-hitter James Mouton and a sacrifice fly by Grissom.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Reds 6&AMP;frac12; games behind St. Louis in the NL
Central. The Cardinals beat Chicago 5-1 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Reds captain Barry Larkin played his 1,800th game. ...
Sexson has driven in at least one run in seven straight games,
matching his career high. ... Bell notched his second hit of the
season, a solid single in the third inning. ... Cincinnati OF
Dmitri Young left the game in the fifth inning after suffering a
bruised right shoulder when he tripped over Sexson at first base on
a ground out in the fourth.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Ends Controversial Tour  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA OLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez on Wednesday
concluded a foreign tour that solidified his position as a force
within the OPEC cartel -- and angered Washington with his defiant
visit to Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez gave a memorable performance on the world stage, taking a
spin through Baghdad with a car driven by Saddam and giving Libya's
Moammar Ghadafi a bear hug. He irked the United States by becoming
the first world leader to call on Saddam since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate consequences of his tour remain uncertain. It's
doubtful the trip will set off a stream of heads of state to
Saddam's doors. It's also unclear whether Chavez will achieve a
goal more dear to him: cementing unity within the fractious,
11-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Iraq, Chavez further rebuffed the United States by
calling for an end to U.N. sanctions against Saddam's country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It turns out that Iraq is not hell and Saddam is not the
devil. I call on the U.N. to lift sanctions against Iraq because I
was there. In Baghdad there were children who were dying and they
couldn't get medicine because of the sanctions,'' Chavez said in a
Wednesday night televised national address after returning to
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez added that he didn't know he would be the first head of
state to visit Saddam since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know the trip would be so controversial. Many said
the trip to Iraq was due to an aversion to the United States but I
don't have an aversion to anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Chavez, increasing Venezuela's international profile was a
satisfying enough coup.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a recuperation of Venezuela's leadership in OPEC,''
Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel told The Associated Press in
an interview on Wednesday. ''The trip opened up space for Venezuela
in international affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said Chavez established himself as a peacemaker within
OPEC -- a goal more important, he said, than persuading the group's
members to adopt Venezuela's vision of fair oil prices and adequate
production volume.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel played down the friction that emerged between the United
States and Venezuela over Chavez's visit to Iraq, saying the
dispute was a normal bump in otherwise smooth relations between two
allies.
</P>
<P>
   But for some Venezuelans, seeing their leader in a car with
Saddam was an embarrassment. Jeopardizing relations with the United
States, the critics say, is a high price to pay for promoting OPEC
unity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am angry that the president of Venezuela hangs out with the
greatest tyrants in the world,'' said Venezuelan oil expert Jose
Luis Cordeiro. ''Venezuela's interest is in its relations with its
(oil) consumers, who are the United States, Europe and Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez says strengthening OPEC as a global force is in
Venezuela's economic interests. The president sought to persuade
fellow OPEC heads of state to stand up to U.S.-led pressure to
lower prices, which are hovering at 10-year highs of nearly $30 a
barrel. A crash in the price of oil would be ''a death sentence''
for countries like Venezuela, Chavez said during his trip.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still out on whether Venezuela has sufficient weight
within the cartel to persuade its members to comply with their
production quotas or to adopt Chavez's band mechanism designed to
keep prices within in a set range. Chavez's pleas had little impact
on oil prices, an indication that traders and analysts are
skeptical about the Venezuelan leader's influence on OPEC
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez hailed the trip as a triumph, pointing out that he
persuaded the leaders of Iran, Indonesia, Nigeria, Algeria and
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to travel to Caracas for a
September heads of State OPEC summit -- only the second of its kind
in the cartel's 41-year history. He also claimed to have rallied
support for the price band mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's goal of ending Iraq's isolation may be elusive,
although Indonesia said it agreed with Chavez's calls for an end to
U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chavez likes to see himself as a leader in the global scene
but I'm not sure other countries see him that way. There's still
strong advocacy for isolating Iraq,'' said Michael Shifter, a Latin
America analyst with Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the opening of a new Congress overshadowed the
controversial trip. Although jaws dropped around the world at the
sight of the South American leader dining with Saddam, the trip was
no shock to Venezuelans, long accustomed to their leader's
irreverent ways.
</P>
<P>
   And opposition politicians stayed out of the controversy -- too
timid to personally attack the freshly re-elected popular
president, who entered Venezuela's national scene eight years ago
by staging a failed military coup.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opposition doesn't want to take on Chavez personally right
now. It would be political suicide,'' said local pollster Luis
Vicente Leon.

added a goal Wednesday night as the two returned from injuries to
lead the United States to a 7-0 victory over Barbados in World Cup
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're two very elite forwards. They worked well together,''
U.S. coach Bruce Arena said. ''They're guys who know what their job
is. They know how to finish the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was familiar with Foxboro Stadium, having played here for
four years with the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer.
But he signed last winter with Everton, traditionally one of the
strongest clubs in England's Premier League.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old forward scored eight goals in 19 games last
season for Everton, making him -- by far -- the most successful U.S.
non-goalkeeper exported to England. The experience has made him a
better player, and now it's helping to improve the U.S. team, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just more experienced. He's better in front of the
goal,'' midfielder Claudio Reyna said. ''He's something that we
need: a scrappy guy who can finish, who works hard, who gives you
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore missed the first two World Cup qualifiers while recovering
from an injury to his right knee sustained April 8. But he's fit
now, playing in seven of Everton's eight preseason games and
scoring twice on Aug. 7, against Plymouth Argyle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been quite a while. It's been since November that I've
played with the (national) team,'' Moore said. ''So I was quite
anxious.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one man seemed to be unimpressed with Moore -- Barbados
coach Horrace Beckles.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a moderate player,'' Beckles said after the game. ''He's
nothing really to be so joyful about.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride laughed off Beckles' comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that's his feeling, that's his feeling,'' McBride said.
''Obviously, we feel differently.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride broke his cheekbone and also missed the first two
qualifiers. He has four goals this season for the MLS Columbus Crew
and played well for the national team during the U.S. Cup in June.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt great to be back with the guys,'' McBride said. ''It's
been a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Roll Call of States On Tap  </HEADLINE>
By EUN-KYUNG KIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- District of Columbia Mayor Anthony Williams
sent a message about his city's lack of voting rights in Congress:
''The time has come to end taxation without representation.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wisconsin chairwoman Terri Spring listened to fellow
delegates who pleaded please, please, please DON'T mention
''cheeseheads.''
</P>
<P>
   With the outcome clear, the roll call of states Wednesday night
at the Democratic National Convention gave delegations a chance to
exercise bragging rights, all while they formally nominated a
president.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was the first to vote, casting all 81 votes ''for our
favorite son, our friend, for the next president of the United
States, Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's Republican opponent, George W. Bush, was a
popular target. Alaska delegation chairwoman Cindy Spanyers
declared her state is ''more than twice the size as Texas but with
a Democratic governor 10 times as smart.''
</P>
<P>
   And Texas assured everyone that ''we'll work to show what 'W'
really stands for -- wrong. W is wrong for Texas. Check the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Some states used the roll call as a chance to send a message,
others mentioned the whimsy and a few combined both.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Corzine, a Democratic candidate for Senate from New Jersey,
boasted that his state was ''home of warriors to defend a woman's
right to choose, brothers and sisters of labor, home of the Million
Mom March, home of the team of excellence, the New Jersey Devils
... and the incomparable Bruce Springsteen.''
</P>
<P>
   The roll call ritual has elicited interesting tidbits of
information at past conventions. For example, that North Dakota was
the ''first state to meet the standards of the Clean Air Act'' and
New Jersey was ''where Thomas Edison invented the first point of
light.''
</P>
<P>
   Bethine Church, who heads Idaho's delegation, wanted to combine
the past and present with her speech. During the 1960 Democratic
convention, she sat front and center as her husband, then-U.S. Sen.
Frank Church, delivered the keynote address.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this same city 40 years ago, my husband, young Senator
Frank Church, gave the keynote address which helped usher in the
Camelot era. Tonight it gives me joy to cast the votes for Idaho,
where the Democrats shall rise again,'' she said this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the state boasting has been a matter of opinion. At the
recent GOP nominating convention, both Indiana and Kentucky claimed
status as the ''basketball capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The roll call usually gets read on one night, but Republicans
broke with tradition at their convention in Philadelphia earlier
this month by conducting the procedure over four evenings.
</P>
<P>
   On one evening, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush used the occasion to air
some family laundry as he cast his state's votes for his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor of this state, and perhaps the governor of the
state of Texas,'' he declared, ''is the only person on this floor
that has had his mouth washed out by the greatest, most popular
woman in the world, been spanked by a president of the United
States, and gotten a wedgie from the next president of the United
States.''

<HEADLINE> United States 7, Barbados 0  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- A 7-0 game isn't unknown for the U.S.
soccer team -- but usually it was a loss.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when a defeat would have put the Americans in danger
of World Cup elimination, the United States dominated from start to
finish, winding up with a record-setting 7-0 rout of Barbados in a
critical World Cup qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   ''We actually could have scored quite a few more, but the
finishing wasn't perfect,'' said U.S. forward Joe-Max Moore, who
had two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Pope, Brian McBride, John O'Brien, Tab Ramos and Earnie
Stewart scored one goal each as the United States exploited a
two-man advantage for the final 49 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be fair, with all due respect, it wasn't the strongest
opponent we play,'' U.S. captain Claudio Reyna said.
</P>
<P>
   It matched the largest victory margin ever for the United States
-- and it was the first time the Americans ever scored seven goals
in a World Cup qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and McBride returned from injuries to give the Americans a
new forward line, and Stewart and Cobi Jones ran up and down the
flanks, serving them with crosses.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like the field was tilted toward the end the United
States was running at. The Americans outshot Barbados 34-4,
including 24-2 in the second half, when it was soccer's equivalent
of playground hoops -- dribbling around the outmanned defenders for
the best shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seven-nothing. We wouldn't have guessed that any means,'' U.S.
coach Bruce Arena said. ''Despite some of the poor reviews we
received after the first two games, we could be in pretty good
shape if we get three points against Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a 1-1 tie at Guatemala and a 2-1 loss at Costa Rica,
the Americans put themselves in contention for one of the groups's
two berths in next year's regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   The United States (1-1-1), which next plays Guatemala on Sept. 3
at Washington, jumped to second in Group C of the North and Central
American and Caribbean semifinals with four points, trailing Costa
Rica (2-1).
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala (1-1-1) is third, trailing the U.S. team on goal
difference, and Barbados (1-2) dropped to last.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding a lineup with seven European-based players, the
Americans took the lead in the 14th minute when Pope outjumped two
defenders to beat goalkeeper Horace Stoute on Stewart's corner
kick.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who scored eight goals in 19 games last season for
Everton in England's Premier League, let the ball bounce off a heel
in the 28th, creating McBride's goal.
</P>
<P>
   Augustus Hurdle was ejected in the 38th minute for twice
elbowing Jones (with Jones throwing a punch in between) and Eric
Lavine was ejected three minutes later for getting his second
yellow card for a rough foul on Chris Armas, who strained a
ligament in his left knee and will be sidelined for 3-to-12 weeks,
according to Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Barbados coach Horrace Beckles, who has just four professionals
on his 18-man roster, couldn't believe the calls by referee Jose
Pineda of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was atrocious. The referee was very, very poor,'' Beckles
said. ''We got the red cards -- I'm still not sure what they were
for. You can't put vulnerable referees in the game, especially in
the United States, where they are easily intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The referee doesn't even speak English. He doesn't understand
what the players are saying to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart raced up the field to create the third goal, passing to
Moore, who was stopped on a right-footed shot, then scored off the
rebound with his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien scored 29 seconds into the second half -- the first time
he handled the ball. Ramos added his first international goal since
1998 in the 72nd minute, Stewart scored two minutes later and Moore
scored again in the 82nd.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have to come to Barbados,'' Beckles said, looking ahead
to Nov. 15, when the Americans play their last game of the
semifinal round. ''It will be a different game. It will be on a
level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: The only other seven-goal wins for the Americans were in
1993 against the Cayman Islands (8-1) and El Salvador (7-0). The
United States has lost by seven or more goals five times, including
twice against England and once against Argentina. ... With 22 goals
in 80 international appearances, Moore moved into second on the
U.S. career scoring list, 11 behind Eric Wynalda. ... The U.S. team
had nine corner kicks; Barbados had none. ... Pope and Eddie Lewis
came out of the game in the second half with minor injuries.

<HEADLINE> Moceanu Withdraws From Trials  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Dominique Moceanu overcame the bitter split with
her parents and the years of bouncing from gym to gym and coach to
coach. In the end, though, it was her body that betrayed her.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest member of the Magnificent Seven withdrew from the
Olympic trials late Wednesday night because of a bone chip in her
right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hardest part after talking to her was, 'I've worked so
hard. I've put so much into this comeback,''' said Mary Lee Tracy,
Moceanu's coach.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, 18, had surgery on the same knee last year, and the
bone chip came about gradually, Tracy said. Moceanu's knee gave out
during practice Tuesday, and the pain worsened.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday morning, she could barely train and her knee gave
out on her periodically. In afternoon workouts, she could only
manage some simple sit-ups and handstands while the rest of the
gymnasts went through their full routines for competition, which
begins Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   She quit practice early, watching from the sidelines with a
dejected look on her face.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't something that's just going to get better,'' she
said then. ''It needs to get fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right.
</P>
<P>
   Though initial tests didn't show any problems, the bone chip was
discovered when doctors spoke with the orthopedic surgeon who
operated on her knee last year. The chip had dislodged itself,
preventing Moceanu from even being able to bend or straighten her
knee.
</P>
<P>
   She is expected to fly back to Cincinnati on Monday and have
surgery next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't really so much an accident. It just started
hurting,'' Tracy said. ''It had been a little bit of nagging aches
and pain, but these kids have so much of that they never know when
it's the beginning of something. It was the beginning of
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu was not immediately available for comment. She was
expected to hold a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She becomes the second of the five still competing members of
the Magnificent Seven to drop out of the trials. Jaycie Phelps
withdrew last week because of chronic knee problems.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing eighth at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships last
month, Moceanu was a long shot to make the six-woman Olympic team.
But after all she's endured the last four years, she wasn't about
to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ''She knew she was a far way out. Not one day did she ever come
in like, 'Oh geez, I'm never going to make it,''' Tracy said. ''She
was going to do this new vault. She'd some changes and really was
going to make a great showing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course the opportunity to make the Olympic team was
disappointing. But you train to perform. She trained, and she's not
going to be able to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Since being part of the first American women's team to win
Olympic gold, Moceanu's life has been filled with disappointment
and trouble. Just two years after the Atlanta Olympics, her life
become tabloid fodder when she ran away from home and asked to be
declared a legal adult, accusing her parents of squandering her
money.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, she was back in court asking for a protective
order against her father, Dumitru, who allegedly inquired about
having two of her friends killed. Dumitru Moceanu, who denied the
accusations, was ordered to stay away from his daughter for a year.
The order was lifted five months later.
</P>
<P>
   The family has slowly reconciled, but the turmoil took a toll on
her career. She bounced around the country searching for a coach
and hadn't trained seriously for about two years when she arrived
at Tracy's gym in January. She'd also grown nine inches and gained
40 pounds, and national coordinator Bela Karolyi often questioned
her durability and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   But she'd improved steadily in the last few months, and was
hoping to make a big move at the Olympic trials. Instead, she'll be
left at home to figure out what her future holds while her
teammates head for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''She doesn't need to make any decisions right now. She just
kind of needs to grieve this,'' Tracy said. ''She doesn't know what
she wants to do. But she's certainly not talking about, 'OK, this
is my retirement.'''

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Tells U.S. To Elect Gore  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Embarking on a ''miraculous journey,'' vice
presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman urged Americans Wednesday
night to elect Al Gore to the White House, hailing him before the
Democratic National Convention as a man of ''vision and values''
who would extend the nation's current prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spoke minutes before delegates formalized Gore's
nomination in a roll call of the states that cemented the
Democratic ticket for the fall campaign against Republicans George
W. Bush and Richard Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president had a cameo appearance on the third night of
his convention. He strode onto the podium to hug his Karenna after
she placed his name in nomination with a speech studded with
reminiscences of her childhood. He did not speak, saving his
remarks for Thursday night's finale.
</P>
<P>
   That left centerstage to Lieberman, the first Jew to take a
place on a major party ticket and little known nationally until
Gore unexpectedly selected him as running mate a week ago. He was
greeted by Democratic delegates waving a sea of red signs
emblazoned with his name. ''Go Joe go,'' delegates chanted. ''We're
gonna go, right to the White House,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman allowed himself a moment of wonder at his fate,
asking, or perhaps declaring, ''Is America a great country or
what?!''
</P>
<P>
   The convention session capped a day in which Gore arrived in
California and proclaimed: ''We're the new guard and we're going to
bring positive change.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the outward displays of enthusiasm, there were
expressions of concern from some Democrats about polls which showed
Bush with a lead of 10 points or so.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of anxiety hanging over this convention,'' said
Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, whose aides have spoken openly about
a campaign in 2004 if the GOP wins the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates heard three nominating speeches for the vice
president. Karenna Gore Schiff, a rising political figure in the
Gore campaign, drew cheers when she said her father would ''always,
always'' defend a woman's right to an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the convention hall, a large, late afternoon crowd of
protesters gathered, standing face-to-face with scores of riot-clad
police. Authorities said arrests for the first three days of the
convention totalled 200.
</P>
<P>
   A few delegates arriving for the convention's evening session
were escorted through the crowd by authorities. Others were
directed to other gates away from the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Little known outside his home state of Connecticut before his
selection by Gore just a week ago, Lieberman touched on his faith,
his belief in Gore and his disdain for Republican policy proposals.
He took pains to offer words of reassurance to blacks who had
questioned his commitment to affirmative action, as well as party
supporters who fretted over his support for school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   He said the time had come to ''tear down the remaining walls of
discrimination in this nation ... and that's why I say, when it
comes to affirmative action, mend it but please don't end it.'' On
education, he said the ticket was ''committed to making America's
public schools the best in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman sprinkled his speech with references to his religion.
He said his ''miraculous journey begins here and now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, introduced him to the delegates,
then met him halfway across the podium. They kissed, twice, then
stepped forward together to acknowledge the cheers. Strains of
Chariots of Fire filled the hall.
</P>
<P>
   His evaluation of Gore as a man of ''vision and values'' seemed
aimed at voters who need reassurance after President Clinton's
well-chronicled personal failures.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said the Republicans ''are decent and likeable men,''
but told delegates to the convention and a nationwide television
audience there are ''very real differences between us in this
election'' and that if elected they would ''squander'' the current
economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   On education, the environment, health care and campaign finance,
he said, the two parties see America ''through different sets of
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the economy, he said, Republicans would spend the surplus to
''give a tax break to those who need it least, at the expense of
all our other needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Under their plan, the middle class gets a little, and the
wealthy get a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad the GOP has changed their rhetoric,'' he said, ''but
I wish they would also change their policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign fired right back, with spokesman Ari Fleischer
saying, ''In the ten days Joe Lieberman has been at Al Gore's side,
he has walked away from his position on Social Security, school
choice, and affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's arrival in the convention city marked a new phase of the
campaign. With President Clinton returned to Washington, the vice
president sought to establish his own identity.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts said bluntly that Clinton must
cede the spotlight to allow his longtime understudy to establish
himself. ''We may need to get the Jaws of Life to pry him free from
the thing, but we've got to pry him free,'' Kerry said of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   At an arrival event for Gore, Lieberman added to Gore's
enthusiasm, playfully urging the crowd to ''help me win this one
for the Tipper,'' a reference to Gore's wife, and a play on Ronald
Reagan's old -- and winning -- refrain about winning one for the
Gipper.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of Wednesday's program was Lieberman's speech
followed by the ritual roll call of the states that would formally
deliver Gore's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's wife Hadassah had the pleasure of introducing her
husband to the convention. ''For Joe, family, faith, neighborhood,
congregation and community are the guideposts of his life,'' she
said in prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Security around the city was tight, so much so that some
delegates expressed misgivings. ''Everywhere you go, there's
nothing but police,'' said West Virginia delegate Mary Pearl
Compton.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard his plan en route to California, the vice president
worked on the acceptance speech he will deliver Thursday night.
''He's looking forward to it,'' said Carter Eskew, a top
strategist. ''This is his main chance to be the main guy.''
</P>
<P>
   In arrival remarks, Gore did not mention the man he hopes to
succeed in the White House. ''The future begins here in
California,'' he said. ''The victory begins here in California.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his Thursday night acceptance speech would draw specific
contrasts with the Republicans, and said he intends to fight for a
higher minimum wage, HMO reform, a prescription drug benefit for
Medicare, safety locks for guns and other causes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need your help to fight for you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides set three nominating speeches to present the vice
president's name for nomination, including one by his daughter,
Karenna Gore Schiff, a rising political figure in the Gore
campaign, and actor Tommy Lee Jones, Gore's roommate during college
at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of party supporters and elected officials provided
warm-up oratory for the main speech Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, in line to become Speaker if
Democrats win control of the House this fall, pledged that his
party ''will be humble about our beliefs and listen to the beliefs
of others'' if it wins control.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will work with the Republicans to try to find consensus and
bring all Americans along together. Hear me: we will replace 'my
way or the highway' with 'our way together.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman warmed up for his convention address with a series of
appearances before groups of delegates. He drew applause from gays
and lesbians when he declared his opposition to the Clinton
administration's policy of ''don't ask, don't tell'' for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   He told one group he didn't want anyone's vote because of his
religion, but because ''we are the best ticket for America's
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans dispatched a team to rebut the Democratic convention
message. ''We're not here to rain on anybody's parade, we're just
providing some balance,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash. Still,
she jabbed at Gore and the Democrats. ''We were much better on the
unity front. We solidified our base before we can to the
convention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to the tempests that have swirled at the
Democratic convention, including a controversy over Rep. Loretta
Sanchez and a fund-raiser she originally scheduled for the Playboy
Mansion; as well as questions among Democratic core constituencies
about Lieberman's positions on several issues.

   The Gore high command continued to wrestle with minor problems,
including Nevadans unhappy with the platform position on the
disposal of nuclear waste. The vice president issued a letter to
Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada pledging to veto any legislation that
made Nevada a repository for thousands of tons of nuclear waste.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Marks Anniversary of Quake  </HEADLINE>
By LOUIS MEIXLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLCUK, Turkey (AP) -- Hundreds of Turks held candles, waved
black flags or simply wept in silence Thursday as Turkey marked the
first anniversary of a devastating earthquake that left at least
17,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   People gathered in central squares in hard-hit towns at 3:02
a.m. to mark the moment that the quake devastated parts of western
Turkey, collapsing more than 285,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are here to remember,'' said Kemal Ozcan, a retired shop
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Ozcan was in his bedroom when the quake struck last year,
collapsing his ceiling and trapping him and his wife beneath the
rubble. They spent almost four hours under the concrete before
neighbors dug them out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still can't escape the feelings of that night,'' Ozcan
said. ''We can't believe we are alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozcan was lucky.
</P>
<P>
   A few yards away at the memorial service in Golcuk, one of the
hardest hit towns, stood Metin Sagdic. Sagdic survived the quake
with his wife and children, but at least 30 of his relatives were
crushed to death.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel as if it happened yesterday,'' he said. He added that
some of the bodies of his cousins have not been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the earthquake, evidence of the devastation is
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Shattered homes and factories still line the streets of Golcuk,
70 miles west of Istanbul, as well as other towns. Some 26,000
people still live in tent cities, while another 150,000 live in
prefabricated homes that are oppressively hot in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The government has promised to build more permanent housing and
has said most of the tent cities will be closed before winter. But
many people in the quake area are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing has changed,'' said Sagdic. ''We see the same
collapsed buildings one year later.''

<HEADLINE> Turkey Economy Recovering From Quake  </HEADLINE>
By LOUIS MEIXLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADAPAZARI, Turkey (AP) -- Idris Goren spent the past year working
for free on most Saturdays, clearing rubble and repairing machinery
damaged in an earthquake that almost destroyed the train factory
where he works.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts, and those of the 880 other employees who
volunteered with him, have helped the lathes of the state-owned
factory to spin again -- though often in buildings without roofs or
with walls containing holes the size of car tires.
</P>
<P>
   Like the train factory, Turkey's economy is recovering from an
Aug. 17 earthquake that shattered the nation's industrial
heartland, leaving more than 17,000 people dead and flattening more
than 100,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake galvanized the often squabbling members of
Turkey's governing coalition, who quickly banded together and
passed far-reaching economic reforms. The fiscal measures cleared
the way for international loans, increased investment and improved
economic health.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial production, which fell to 30 percent of capacity
after the quake, is back to the pre-quake level of about 75
percent. As a result of disciplined government spending, inflation
fell from a pre-quake annual rate of 65 percent to 59 percent this
June. Inflation should fall to 35 percent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The damage that was caused by the quake forced (government
members) to get their act together,'' said Atilla Yesilada, an
economist at Bender Securities. ''It unified the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank extended $7
billion in loans to Turkey after it agreed to reforms that included
a multibillion dollar privatization program. The loans helped
Turkey rebuild from an earthquake that caused an estimated $2
billion to $4 billion in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Aid from the Turkish government went to repair factories such as
TUVASAS, where Goren works to supply the national railroads. While
big plants are mostly back, economists caution that few Turks have
homeowners insurance and almost 175,000 people are still in tents
or temporary houses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many smaller businesses that form a huge part of
the Turkish economy have yet to recover and do not even figure in
official statistics. Turkey's black market economy is at least
three-fourths as large as the official $200 billion economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big companies are doing well but most of the small and
medium businesses along with their workers were wiped out,''
Yesilada said.
</P>
<P>
   In Adapazari, a major industrial town 90 miles east of Istanbul,
signs of destruction remain everywhere. Abandoned houses that were
torn off of their foundations stand lopsided along roads.
</P>
<P>
   At the TUVASAS factory, crushed train cars lie overturned in a
corner. Twisted train tracks line the floors, swerving in some
places and pinched together in others.
</P>
<P>
   The quake caused $63 million in damage at the factory and killed
three workers who were in their homes when the pre-dawn temblor
struck. A fourth worker was killed during the cleanup efforts when
a block fell on him.
</P>
<P>
   Goren, a mechanic, says he was in shock when he first saw the
mostly destroyed factory. ''We didn't know if it could be
repaired,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The workers union rallied the employees, many of whom feared the
factory wouldn't reopen if they didn't pitch in. Nearly
three-quarters of 1,200 workers donated time to the plant, the
largest employer in Adapazari.
</P>
<P>
   The factory now is capable of fixing about 40 train cars a
month, down from the 60 to 65 cars it could fix before the quake.
The train car production line, however, will remain closed for at
least the remainder of the year as repairs continue.
</P>
<P>
   Goren was realistic explaining why he gave so freely of his
time. ''We earn money for our bread from this factory,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Boat Struggles To Be Saved  </HEADLINE>
By MIA PENTA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- In its heyday, the Kalakala ferry was considered
a technological marvel. Passengers in the 1930s delighted in its
electric lights, its telegraph machine and its slick art deco
looks.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, the craft was sold to an Alaskan company,
which put it on the mudflats of Kodiak, processed fish in its belly
and let oceans of raindrops beat mercilessly against its hull.
</P>
<P>
   The 276-foot boat was eventually rescued by Peter Bevis, a local
sculptor, who stumbled upon it in 1988 while working in Kodiak as a
commercial fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds greeted the Kalakala's return to Seattle in 1998, and
Bevis imagined a new life for the 65-year-old ferry as a museum,
restaurant or dance club.
</P>
<P>
   Now the up-and-down career of the Kalakala has once again
encountered rough waters.
</P>
<P>
   What was once the pride of Seattle now rusts away on Lake Union,
and the man who poured his heart, soul and pocketbook into saving
her can barely afford basic expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel it's my duty to continue to fix up this boat, to make
sure this project gets finished,'' said Bevis, who borrowed money
and mortgaged his house to rescue the Kalakala.
</P>
<P>
   Initial interest -- and donations -- to fix up the craft have
dried up. The Kalakala Foundation, formed by Bevis and nearly 2,900
volunteers to restore the boat, makes just enough to pay insurance
and moorage.
</P>
<P>
   Bevis still owes nearly $1 million for preparing the Kalakala
and towing it home, and the foundation estimates it needs another
$20 million to restore the boat.
</P>
<P>
   While the public hasn't been generous, many are still
sentimental about the Kalakala. Mayor Paul Schell helped welcome
the boat, and Gov. Gary Locke named last October ''Kalakala
Awareness Month.'' An elementary school teacher was inspired to
write a children's book about the ferry.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be considered a historic site,'' said 73-year-old
Mary Ellen Kanyer who rode the Kalakala as a child. ''We're not
like the East Coast. We're too young to appreciate antiques.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalakala's financial predicament is not uncommon. Old ships,
especially those left to deteriorate, are expensive to restore,
said Kevin Foster, chief of the National Maritime Heritage Program
of the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Historic ships have little federal or state support. The
Kalakala Foundation did receive a $285,000 federal grant to be
administered by the city of Seattle, but needs $190,000 in matching
funds before it gets any money.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kalakala is a ''one-of-a-kind artifact,''
soliciting money for a boat in its condition is difficult, said Bob
Sittig, executive director of the Seattle-based Maritime Heritage
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen it before, and that's what Peter is up against,''
Sittig said. ''People will never donate to an attraction that looks
like it will never get done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kalakala was launched in 1935 to carry passengers and cars
across Puget Sound. With its streamlined shape and modern electric
conveniences, it embodied the most advanced technology of its time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was such a radical design,'' said Robert Engstrom, a
retired Washington State Ferries captain who once piloted the
Kalakala. ''It was certainly a showpiece for the Pacific
Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Engstrom, however, believes the Kalakala is best remembered with
fond memories and old pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate to be a wet blanket, but I think a scrap pile is the
best place for it,'' said Engstrom.

<HEADLINE> Pennsylvania speed coach trains kids, pros with similar programs  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOWNINGTOWN, Pa. (AP) - Christa Swiegart and Suzie Grech are
working out on adjacent stairclimbers. They also race through sand
pits, dart around orange cones and traverse rope ladders together.
And at the end of the day, each will finish their workouts by
jumping rope.
</P>
<P>
   Both train at a suburban Philadelphia training center run by a
speed consultant for the Philadelphia Eagles and both hope to
improve their speed on the soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Swiegart, 14, wants to make the varsity
soccer team when she starts high school this fall; Grech, 18, wants
to keep her place as goalie for the Spanish National Soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try to teach the athletes how to do what they do better,''
said Duane Carlisle, founder and executive director of Lightning
Fast Training Systems. ''The body works the same if it's a
12-year-old or a high school athlete or an adult professional
athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past six years, Carlisle, a former All-America track
star at the University of Maryland, has demonstrated his
all-purpose training program with Lightning Fast. Founded in 1995,
the company trains more than 1,000 people ay ear - including about
50 professional athletes - at two training centers in Downingtown
and Cherry Hill, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The training programs are tailored for specific sports - then
modified for specific athletes' abilities. Tennis players practice
quick turns and agility; baseball players learn short bursts of
speed along straightaways; football players run in a sand pit or up
a hill for resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like having someone to work with, someone on my back,
someone behind me to push me,'' said soccer goalie Grech, who lives
in Bryn Mawr and will attend the University of Michigan this fall.
''It doesn't matter what that person's training for ... the World
Cup or weekends in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the Downingtown training center, Carlisle proves that. In
the weight rooms, teen-age field hockey and football players mingle
with professional lacrosse and soccer stars. A player who was cut
from the San Diego Chargers walks by a homemaker lifting free
weights while waiting for her teen-age daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't treat me any differently than any of these other
athletes. My husband laughs when I tell him who I see here, I don't
even know who half of them are. He does, of course,'' said Patti
Sweigart from Gap, Pa., whose daughter Christa was outside in a
group training regiment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, professional athletes require more intense training
than their younger counterparts. Carlisle has supervised
seven-to-10-day training for NFL draft prospects, including running
back Ki-Jana Carter, the No. 1 overall pick in the 1995 draft, and
quarterback Kerry Collins, the fifth pick overall in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle is a speed consultant for the Eagles and last year was
speed coach for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, which was the first Major
League baseball team to hire a speed trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's become the norm, to have sports-specific training. It's
gotten to where speed training is so important it goes on at the
highest levels,'' said sports agent Mike Clohisy, of the
Boston-based National Pro Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Clohisy has referred about 25 college and professional athletes
to Carlisle, including Chicago Bears cornerback Jerry Azumah, who
broke the vertical jump record during the 1998 NFL Combine after
training with Carlisle. Carlisle also helped Baltimore Ravens
running back Priest Holmes, who improved his 40-yard dash time from
4.7 seconds to 4.4 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like fine-tuning a Ferrari,'' Clohisy said. ''What he's
doing with them, as with any top athlete in the pros all the way
down to grammar school, he's trying to get the best out of an
athlete.''

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept: Laser Cost Doubled  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Development of the world's most powerful laser
to monitor the nation's nuclear arsenal without testing -- a project
already dogged by cost overruns and delays -- could cost nearly
three times its original $1 billion price tag, congressional
auditors say.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department told the General Accounting Office the
cost of the laser project at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
in California has soared to $2.2 billion -- twice what it was
predicted to be in 1995. But the GAO, the investigative arm of
Congress, said a more accurate total is closer to $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as January, its price was said to be $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-be-released GAO report says that the project has
been mismanaged by Lawrence Livermore and that technical problems
as well as unexpected expenses and scheduling delays were withheld
from outside reviewers and the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   While costs have soared, the project has lagged far behind
schedule, with its completion date now put at 2008, six years
behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The laser, which is to be the most sophisticated and powerful
ever developed, is a key part of the department's nuclear weapons
stewardship program. The project consists of 192 laser beams used
to simulate a nuclear explosion. The beams are to shoot energy onto
a single target, recreating in a laboratory the thermonuclear
conditions caused by a nuclear detonation.
</P>
<P>
   Formally known as the National Ignition Facility, the laser is
also part of a government effort to properly maintain, test and
monitor the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile without resumption
of actual testing of warheads and bombs at the Nevada Test Site.
</P>
<P>
   A draft copy of the GAO report was obtained Wednesday by The
Associated Press from two citizen groups that have been critical of
the National Ignition Facility.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report attributes the cost overruns to an unrealistic
original budget, poor management at Lawrence Livermore and ''an
absence of effective independent reviews'' and oversight by the
Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   GAO investigators also found that senior managers of the laser
project withheld their concerns about the technical and management
problems from the Energy Department and the director of the
Livermore Lab, which is operated by the University of California.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson last year ordered a review of
the laser project after he learned of a $350 million cost overrun.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the costs have continued to soar, with the Energy
Department sending a $2.2 billion cost estimate to Congress in
June, according to the GAO report.
</P>
<P>
   But the GAO said the actual costs exceed $2.8 billion, and
warned, ''technical problems may further drive up'' the cost if
they are not easily resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of related research and development needed for the
laser to be used as planned also have increased, according the GAO,
from $1 billion in 1995 to nearly $1.8 billion. The Energy
Department estimates the cost increases to be more modest -- no more
than $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   Technical problems affecting both costs and the completion
schedule for the laser were first raised in the summer of 1998 and
documented over a three-month period in early 1999, the GAO said.
Yet, Livermore's director, Bruce Tarter, told Congress in March
1999 that the project was ''on budget and on schedule.''

<P>
   In early 1999, an independent contractor also reviewed the
project's progress ''and did not report any significant cost,
schedule or technical'' problems, although ''over two dozen senior
NIF managers knew the project faced growing problems that
threatened both its costs and schedules,'' according to the GAO
report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The GAO report shows a pattern of deception involving top
managers,'' said Marylia Kelley, of Tri-Valley Cares, a citizen
group in Livermore that has opposed the project. ''Officials took a
see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil approach and turned a
blind eye to problems they knew or suspected.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's group and another nuclear weapons watchdog
organization, Alliance for Nuclear Accountability, obtained a draft
of the GAO report, which may be released as early as this week. The
report had been requested by the House Science Committee.

<HEADLINE> Somalia Aims For Government Success  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARTA, Djibouti (AP) -- Defying skeptics, Somalia's new National
Assembly has moved to form the country's first central government
in almost 10 years. But its success now relies on contributions
from international donors, who have shown little enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   President Ismael Omar Guelleh of neighboring Djibouti has
largely stood alone in his unqualified support for the 2,000 Somali
civic leaders who have been meeting under a dusty tent in his
country. Those efforts have paid off in the formation of a 225-seat
legislature that most Somalis have warmly welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   But the international community has largely stayed on the
sidelines. The U.N. Security Council made an appeal on behalf of
the Djibouti conference in June, and on Wednesday again called on
the international community to support the peace process. But so
far, there has been little response from donors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I very much hope the international community will not stand
back,'' David Stephen, the U.N. observer to the peace process, told
The Associated Press. ''If it does, those armed elements opposed to
political change will win.''
</P>
<P>
   But those armed factions are exactly what has kept international
donors from getting involved. After the factions overthrew dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, the militias turned on one another and
there has been no national government since.
</P>
<P>
   The largest peacekeeping force in U.N. history was deployed to
Somalia from 1992-95 to deal with a famine, but with disastrous
consequences. The peacekeepers were persistently attacked by
militiamen and 18 U.S. soldiers died in a failed attempt to arrest
one of the militia leaders, an episode that hardened the West's
attitude toward the country at the tip of the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the United Nations has spent up to $100 million a
year in Somalia, most of which has been for emergency aid, not
reconstruction, Stephen said.
</P>
<P>
   If the new assembly is to succeed in uniting the country,
rebuilding infrastructure and enforcing law and order, aid from
international donors will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people want a national government,'' Stephen said. ''It
needs the support of the international community to make that a
reality, otherwise Somalia will be the first of a dangerous trend
where countries are divided between (organized) states and those
with no authority, with the people suffering from warlords and
mafia-style anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Djibouti, a country of 650,000 people squeezed between Somalia
and Eritrea, took the lead on May 2 when it invited the Somalis to
work out their problems in the town of Arta, all expenses paid. The
country, made up mostly of ethnic Somalis, took donations from
citizens and even raised taxes to pay for the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cost millions. It's been a major expense,'' said Roble
Olhaye, Djibouti's ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 failed peace conferences, this effort offers the best
chance for real change, Olhaye said.
</P>
<P>
   The tasks set for the new lawmakers are daunting. The assembly
must persuade faction leaders to respect them, recruit the
militiamen who cruise the streets into new national security force
and then set about collecting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly plans to move to Somalia once a president, prime
minister and Cabinet have been selected and security is ensured.
But without outside funding, there is little hope the legislature
can be more than a debating society.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the diplomats observing the Djibouti conference,
however, are not eager to offer support.
</P>
<P>
   Francesco Sciortino, Italy's envoy to Somalia said his country --
Somalia's colonial master until independence in 1960 -- and other
countries would be willing to help, but offered no details.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels Release 1 Hostage  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels on Wednesday freed a
Filipino woman held hostage for nearly four months on a remote
Philippine island a sign, officials say, ''that everything should
proceed smoothly'' for the release of at least a dozen Western
captives.
</P>
<P>
   Lucrecia Dablo, an employee at Malaysia's Sipadan diving resort
and one of 21 mostly foreign hostages abducted by Abu Sayyaf rebels
from the resort April 23, was not told ahead of time of her
release.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened when suddenly taken by armed men from a hide-out on
Jolo island in the southern Philippines, she said later:
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not expect to be the first one to go.''
</P>
<P>
   She tearfully described her release after 116 days in captivity
as ''like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Dablo's release ''is a signal that everything should proceed
smoothly'' with the other hostages, chief government negotiator
Robert Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators initially had hoped that at least nine Western
hostages would also be freed Wednesday in a deal bankrolled by
Libya. But they said last-minute snags and bad weather had forced a
delay until at least Friday. ''There is zero weather visibility,''
Aventajado said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators hope three French television journalists seized when
they visited the rebels' camp will also be released, but said
Thursday that the rebels were refusing to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Three Malaysians abducted in Sipadan may not be freed because
Malaysian officials have not arrived as scheduled, Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   A chartered plane from Libya was waiting in Manila to pick up
the Western hostages and take them to Tripoli to meet with Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi. Aventajado said the hostages were not
obligated to travel on it.
</P>
<P>
   Planes chartered by Libya have ferried officials and scores of
journalists from Lebanon and South Africa to Tripoli to cover the
release. One of the French hostages is originally from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado and Libyan negotiators flew to Jolo on Wednesday to
work out the final security details for the hostages' turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators want to ensure that the hostages and government
officials are not attacked by the many armed groups on the island,
while the rebels fear they may be targeted by the military after
the hostages are freed.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the rebels freed six Malaysians and one German.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the foreigners from the Sipadan resort, the Abu Sayyaf
rebels seized other hostages in separate abductions.
</P>
<P>
   In all, they hold 28 hostages -- six French, three Malaysians,
two Germans, two Finns, two South Africans and 13 Filipinos --
including the three journalists and a dozen Christian evangelists
who visited the rebels' camp to pray for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage crisis has embarrassed President Joseph Estrada and
has shaken confidence in his government.
</P>
<P>
   Former Libyan Ambassador Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, a negotiator,
denied reports that as much as $25 million in cash was going to the
Abu Sayyaf rebels. Instead, Azzarouq insisted that his country
would fund development projects in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has helped build schools and mosques in the impoverished
south, home to the heavily Roman Catholic country's Muslim
minority.
</P>
<P>
   But it also has been accused of training rebels from the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, another separatist group fighting for an
Islamic state in the southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Denounce Cop Brutality  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Police clashed with bottle-throwing
protesters Wednesday outside the Democratic National Convention
after 2,500 demonstrators marched to the site denouncing police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   An altercation broke out as officers tried to get a truck
through an intersection the protesters had blocked. The protesters
began throwing bottles and other objects at the police, who then
charged with batons. Several rubber bullets were fired.
</P>
<P>
   A few delegates arriving for the convention's evening speakers
were escorted through the crowd. Others walked around to other
gates through the security fence surrounding the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whose streets? Our streets!'' the crowd chanted.
</P>
<P>
   After a standoff, many of the protesters moved north, where
there was another brief scuffle before the marchers returned to a
downtown park near the Staples Centers that they have used as a
base.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the protests broke up, police cited four people for
jaywalking as they returned to the demonstrators' headquarters at
Pershing Square.
</P>
<P>
   During one march, a California Highway Patrol officer was struck
in the chest by a bottle filled with an unidentified liquid that
splashed on his face. He was examined at a hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   A TV sound technician working for CNN was struck by a police
baton while covering a scuffle. She was treated at a hospital for
rib injuries, a CNN spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have been marching for various causes here since last
weekend, mostly peacefully, watched by hundreds of law enforcement
officers. In fact, during Wednesday evening's standoff speakers on
the official protest stage nearby continued, denouncing the federal
case against Wen Ho Lee, the Asian-born Los Alamos scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The convention city arrest total was near 200 through Wednesday,
but significant violence was limited to a clash after a rock
concert at the protest site Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's demonstration, started as a march to police
headquarters, then proceeded to the convention site. On the way,
helmeted officers carrying batons stood two-deep as activists
shouting in bullhorns and holding banners in Spanish and English
moved across downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates said some demonstrators tried to grab their
credentials as they walked near the convention hall. Police warned
people to hide their tags beneath clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They ripped people's credentials off their necks, I think with
the idea of getting into the convention,'' said Matthew Cohen, a
guest of the Connecticut delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service said it had no reports of stolen credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, officers arrested about 30 activists staging
a sit-in at a police station west of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ''No justice, no peace, no racist police,'' protesters shouted
there.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters wearing white gags sat in front of the station's
entrance, going limp as they were arrested and charged with
blocking a public building. They were carried into the station.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at that earlier rally urged the crowd to stay peaceful.
One activist wore a Darth Vader suit, wandering through the
protesters with a baton and making threats of mock arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Among those attending was state Sen. Tom Hayden, a member of the
Chicago 7, the group accused of conspiring to disrupt the 1968
Democratic convention in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Administration To Support Gay Laws  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time ever, the Clinton
administration is in court supporting a local government's effort
to protect gays from employment discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers are urging a federal trial judge in
Louisville, Ky., to reject a challenge to that city's anti-bias
ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The government's friend-of-the-court brief was filed Tuesday.
Justice Department spokeswoman Kara Peterman confirmed that the
administration had not previously filed a pro-gay-rights brief in
support of a local anti-discrimination ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville enacted its ordinance last year, and Dr. J. Barrett
Hyman, a Louisville physician, quickly sued to have it overturned.
</P>
<P>
   A Southern Baptist, Hyman argues that his religious beliefs
prevent him from hiring gays and therefore the ordinance violates
his constitutionally protected freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman's lawyer, Francis Manion, said the ordinance ''would
require him to in effect support or condone that lifestyle. He
believes that requires him to violate his religious beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Manion is with the American Center for Law and Justice, a
conservative advocacy group founded by religious broadcaster Pat
Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   If Hyman wins, the Justice Department brief said, ''other
employers could claim that being required to employ individuals of
a particular race, sex, national origin or religion violates their
First Amendment rights to free exercise of religion or free
association.''
</P>
<P>
   Others could claim that ''engaging in discriminatory advertising
for employment is protected by the First Amendment,'' the brief
contended.
</P>
<P>
   The government brief also says Hyman lacks the legal standing to
sue because he has not actually fired or refused to hire anyone on
the basis of sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing
gay-rights groups in the case, applauded the government's action.
</P>
<P>
   ''All federal civil rights laws would be in danger'' if the law
cannot be enforced, said ACLU attorney Leslie Cooper. ''There can
be a religious basis for all sorts of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Manion disagreed, adding that there is a national consensus that
discrimination based on race or gender is wrong. ''There's no such
consensus on this issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized the Justice Department's decision to get involved.
''I'm kind of offended quite frankly,'' Manion said. ''Its primary
concern ought to be protecting the religious rights of people in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Nathan Lewin, a First Amendment expert who has tried
numerous cases dealing with the free exercise of religion, said he
did not think Hyman would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Lewin said that an individual making that type of claim ''would
have an awfully difficult burden to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   A religious institution could make a case for why it could not
hire gays for certain positions, Lewin said. But other employers
would have a hard time doing that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oral arguments in the case are expected to take place sometime
after Sept. 14.

<HEADLINE> Navy Trains Without Vieques Bombs  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE USS HARRY S. TRUMAN (AP) -- Thousands of U.S. sailors
are training again at Vieques -- but aboard the vessels of the Harry
S. Truman battle group there's a strong feeling that a ban on live
ammunition has rendered the exercises woefully inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got 100 kids, I've got to take them to war, and they're
not trained,'' complained Lt. Juan Rodriguez, whose
Mediterranean-bound bomb assembly crews were busily arming jets
with fake missiles but had yet to assemble a live explosive.
</P>
<P>
   New rules banning live ammunition on the Puerto Rican island
mean about 80 of the Truman's 250 fighter pilots will go abroad
with no experience using live explosives, said air wing commander
Capt. Rob Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   F-18 pilot Jon Taylor, who flew bombing runs on Iraq in December
1998, worried that younger comrades may fly too low in a real
attack, exposing themselves to fragments from their own bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not want to go through what I did without that (live
weapons) training in Vieques,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Navy prized Vieques as a unique site for
combined air, sea and land exercises -- its bombing range a key
training ground for conflicts including the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But training was halted in April 1999 after a civilian guard was
killed by stray bombs, inflaming passions and protest among the
9,400 people who live on the outlying island.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim decades of bombing -- which occurs eight to 10
miles from civilian areas -- have stunted development and tourism,
harmed the environment and caused health problems.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has pledged that the Navy will leave Vieques
by May 2003 if residents so decide in a referendum, and both
presidential candidates, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al
Gore, have promised to stand by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton and the Puerto Rican government agreed in
January that training could resume with restrictions, including a
ban on live bombs and halving the number of annual training days to
90.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the range was cleared of protesters who had camped out
on the property for a year. These are the second large-scale
exercises since then.
</P>
<P>
   In the waters off Vieques are the Truman -- which was
commissioned in 1998 and will deploy for the first time in November
-- as well as two submarines and eight other ships. The Navy invited
reporters to spend two days with the sailors -- and their
exasperation with the new rules was apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The training here is now inadequate,'' said Capt. Mike Smith
of the USS Porter, a new guided missile destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Smith's crew was given one day to fire 87 shells at
the target range -- a requirement before they can go to sea. By noon
they had shot only 12 because of a glitch in the gun's computer.
With the battle group so pressed for time, Smith watched
tight-lipped as another destroyer replaced his ship on the firing
line.
</P>
<P>
   The gun malfunction didn't bother him, because he figured his
crew could use the trouble-shooting practice. But he wanted them to
be facing the danger of a real explosive shell, instead of a
concrete-filled dummy round.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will go through the same procedures, but in the back of
their minds they know this thing will never blow up,'' Smith said.
''I can't simulate the stress of combat with a piece of concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   The spotters who grade the pilots also have cause to complain.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, spotters Kyle Bahl and William Duncan squinted
skyward as F-18s dropped 500-pound dummy bombs on Vieques from
16,000 feet. The bombs were invisible against the sky, and there
was no cloud of dust when the bombs hit because heavy rains had
soaked the range.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller dummy bombs have smoke cartridges to aid spotting, but
not the 500-pounders. Of four dummy bombs dropped on an imaginary
fuel depot, Bahl and Duncan saw only one hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have no idea whether they hit the target,'' Bahl said
after giving the pilots the news. ''You can't give them any
positive feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens, serve in the Navy. Some of
the ones here felt torn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's time to go somewhere else,'' said Jose Joaquin
Garcia, an aviation electrician. ''I know we need to do training,
but when you're causing conflict within your own people, then it's
time to look at another place.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez said his Puerto Rican origins made no difference:
''I wish I could bomb the heck out of Vieques.''

<HEADLINE> Frustrated unions threaten to abandon talks  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Union negotiators for striking phone workers
are threatening to abandon contract talks with Verizon
Communications, frustrated at their sluggish pace.
</P>
<P>
   The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and some
bargainers for the Communications Workers of America said they
would walk out at midnight Thursday, unless they reach an agreement
or can report substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave an uncertain future for a strike affecting 25
million consumers and now entering its 12th day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel the progress is slow,'' said Myles Calvey, negotiator
for the IBEW, representing 14,700 employees in New England and
upstate New York. ''It's unfair to us to still be here. It's unfair
to the membership to be out there, quite frankly, with the promise
of an early settlement. We're not going to continue to spin our
wheels while ... members are out on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   IBEW representatives announced Wednesday their intentions to
leave the talks aimed at replacing contracts for nearly 87,000
employees that expired Aug. 6, unless an agreement was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   CWA, which has two sets of negotiators bargaining here, said at
least one of those two tables also plans to leave the talks at
midnight. That table represents workers from New England and New
York as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very possible'' that the other table, bargaining on
behalf of workers from New Jersey to Virginia, could set the same
ultimatum, said CWA spokesman Jeff Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Together, both CWA tables represent more than 72,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon spokesman Eric Rabe suggested Wednesday night that the
threatened walkout could give all parties greater incentive to wrap
up the protracted negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody needs to get down to business to get this thing
done. If this is the way to get people focused on a deadline, maybe
this isn't such a bad thing,'' Rabe said. ''We're perfectly
prepared to do it before midnight tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Gordon, president of retail markets for Verizon, said
earlier Wednesday that he considered an agreement near for part of
Verizon's unionized work force at some of the call centers. Rabe
would not say which workers Gordon referred to.
</P>
<P>
   But Calvey said progress seemed elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can measure it in centimeters, compared to the overall
issues that are out there,'' he said. ''We seem to go forward one
step and back two steps.''
</P>
<P>
   IBEW spokesman Jim Spellane said even issues that reportedly
have been worked out, such as making it easier for the unions to
organize the company's wireless workers, still have details that
need to be hammered out.
</P>
<P>
   The unions also asserted that one of their key concerns - the
movement of work from Bell Atlantic territory to GTE's region -
remains unresolved. The two companies together formed Verizon in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA says workers fear that Verizon executives will be
rewarded as the company expands nationally, while rank-and-file
employees will be forced to move or take lower-paying jobs to stay
at their current locations.
</P>
<P>
   The strike affects directory assistance, service and repairs in
Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia,
West Virginia and the District of Columbia.

<HEADLINE> Last Picture Show Theater To Reopen  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA K. BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCHER CITY, Texas (AP) -- In this one-stoplight town
immortalized in a 1971 Academy Award-winning film, a national icon
is returning to the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years after the Royal Theater burned down, the front
of the stone building -- complete with a blue and white marquee,
orange awnings and illuminated ''Royal'' sign -- has been rebuilt to
appear as it did in ''The Last Picture Show,'' based on a novel by
Archer City native Larry McMurtry.
</P>
<P>
   The site of the original 100-seat theater won't show movies but
will be an open-air amphitheater with a larger room next door for
bands, plays, dinner theater and art classes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This,'' said project coordinator Abby Abernathy, ''would have
been simple to rebuild as a movie theater, but for what? To get 100
people in here?''
</P>
<P>
   The renovated theater will be unveiled Thursday night, the 35th
anniversary of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth-generation resident, Abernathy, 38, bought the property
in 1986. When his idea for a restaurant failed to get support, he
convinced community leaders to restore the theater as a tourist
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city was beginning to dry up, and we had to re-engineer,''
he said. ''Tourism is what we had to offer, because the pilgrimage
to the theater was everlasting. People kept coming here for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in black-and-white and hailed as a masterpiece, ''The
Last Picture Show'' portrayed the breakdown of an unhappy fictional
one-horse Texas town in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy initially received little support from locals, many of
whom objected to the R-rated movie's sexual material and felt it
denigrated their town.
</P>
<P>
   But after working on the restoration for several years,
Abernathy has apparently convinced many that their link to the past
is key to the town's future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, even the biggest skeptics think it's a good idea,''
Abernathy said.
</P>
<P>
   The theater actually burned before the movie was made. Still,
hundreds of people each year have made the trek to find the Royal
and snap pictures of the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry, who won a Pulitzer Prize for ''Lonesome Dove,'' and
others in town are not surprised by lingering interest in the
landmark thanks to the film, which was nominated for eight Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   '''The Last Picture Show' had a lasting impression because it's
representative of small-town America,'' he said. ''People with
small-town backgrounds can relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Archer City of today is much like it was portrayed in the
film, which was directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starred Cybill
Shepherd, Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms. Ben Johnson and Cloris
Leachman both won supporting actor Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,800 people live in this oil and ranching town in
north-central Texas, about 25 miles south of Wichita Falls. The
only traffic signal is a flashing light. The town has a few stores,
banks, gas stations and one fast-food chain restaurant, Dairy
Queen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess you could say not much has changed here since the
1950s,'' said Mazie Berend, who owns The General Store in the
downtown square.
</P>
<P>
   Berend remembers going to the theater as a child in the 1950s,
when a movie cost 20 cents and popcorn cost a dime. She and her
friends watched John Wayne and Elvis Presley films, often turning
around to see who was necking in the balcony.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody went to the Royal because that's all there was to
do,'' Berend said.
</P>
<P>
   But that stopped when the theater caught fire one night in
August 1965. What was left was a charred facade and pile of stones
and rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were upset because it was their childhood memories
going up in smoke,'' Berend said.
</P>
<P>
   The owners could not afford to rebuild, so the structure
remained in ruins for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy decided to donate the theater to the nonprofit Archer
City Community Foundation, so grant money could be obtained. The
foundation then bought the space next door to expand the theater.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years Abernathy has done most of the physical
rebuilding himself. The final cost will be about $400,000 and
profits from the renovated theater will go back into operating it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a dream come true for this town,'' said Karla
Powell, who owns a jewelry store and floral shop downtown. ''Small
towns, if they don't have something to bring people in, then we're
all in trouble.''

<HEADLINE> Vieques Worker Recalls Accident  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- William ''Butch'' Duncan was there
when the battle for Vieques began.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran target controller in the Navy's bombing range, Duncan
was near the radio inside an observation tower the night of April
19, 1999, watching controllers outside as they directed two F-18
planes toward a simulated convoy of trucks about three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, and surprisingly, the roar of one of the jets was
audible over the tower.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked up and the (controller) was yelling, 'Abort! Abort!'
so I hit the floor,'' Duncan said, recalling the fateful night.
''The windows came in and all the equipment went flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Two 500-pound bombs had been dropped off-target. The first
exploded about 125 feet from the tower and the second about 30 feet
away, said Steve Shegrud, chief of the Atlantic Fleet Weapons
Training Facility.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan said the blast threw him across the room, an observation
deck about 15 feet wide. Along with three others, he suffered only
minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had fires going. I got on the radio and was trying to get
(medical helicopters).''
</P>
<P>
   Other employees rushed outside and found civilian guard David
Sanes -- a resident of the Puerto Rican island -- injured but alive.
</P>
<P>
   Sanes had been patrolling a fence and was caught between the two
bombs, Shegrud said.
</P>
<P>
   He died before rescue teams arrived, and his death set off a
year of protests that have resulted in severe restrictions on the
Navy's training on Vieques, including a ban on live bombs.
</P>
<P>
   A May 1999 Navy report said the pilot mistook the observation
tower for the target. Because the two airplanes had broken
formation on a previous pass, the controller mistook one for the
other and cleared the pilot to drop his bombs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has since installed radar screens, improved the speaker
system outside the tower and painted the building with a
red-and-white checkerboard pattern to improve its visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has long refused to identify the people working that
night, but on Wednesday Navy spokesman Lt. Jeff Gordon confirmed
that Duncan was present. Duncan, 48, works for ITT Industries, a
federal contractor.

<HEADLINE> Defense Tries For Lee's Release  </HEADLINE>
By SUE MAJOR HOLMES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Prosecutors have overstated the secrecy
of the materials allegedly mishandled by Wen Ho Lee when he worked
at Los Alamos National Laboratory, according to his attorneys, who
for the third time are trying to get him out on bail.
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing Wednesday, defense witness John Richter
testified the files that Lee is accused of downloading would have
''no deleterious effect at all on the global strategic balance.''
The hearing was to resume Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Lee locked up is ''much more injurious to the reputation
of the United States,'' said Richter, who worked at Los Alamos from
1958 until he retired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous supporters of Lee were in the courtroom, wearing green
buttons with his name on them.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan-born Lee, 60, is charged with 59 counts involving
downloading restricted files from the nuclear weapons lab to
unsecured computers and tape. If convicted at the trial, which
begins Nov. 6, he could be sentenced to life in prison. He was
ordered to be held without bail in December.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution witness Paul Robinson, president of the Sandia
National Laboratory in New Mexico, testified that the information
could provide guidance to an enemy nation on their own weapons or
could help them develop new weapons they could test.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys have also alleged that Lee was a target of
racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   At a separate hearing Tuesday, attorney Mark Holscher gave the
court copies of statements of federal investigators acknowledging
ethnic profiling and said the government had a duty to explain or
justify its actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that policy exists based on the statements of those in
charge of the policy,'' Holscher said.
</P>
<P>
   Holscher asked U.S. District Judge James Parker to order
prosecutors to turn over a January 2000 Energy Department report on
racial profiling, an Energy Department counterintelligence video
and any FBI reports concerning profiling. Holscher also sought
transcripts from several closed congressional hearings at which the
case was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   It is illegal for a federal prosecution to be based on racial
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Fashing acknowledged that the FBI,
''based on its experience in counterintelligence,'' maintains that
China contacts Chinese-Americans when it wants secret information.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's simply saying they're more likely to be approached,'' she
told the judge.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Brothers Reunited  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- ''Have you any brothers?'' the caller asked.
''Four,'' Lazar Sheiman remembered answering. ''They are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What were their names?'' the caller pressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Haim, Nehamia, ...''
</P>
<P>
   ''What about Leibisch?'' asked the caller.
</P>
<P>
   ''Leibisch is dead,'' Lazar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, Lazar,'' Leibisch said. ''I never died. I'm alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Their similarities are immediately apparent: the same reserved
gestures, the same tight smile, the same courtly ways of a central
European upbringing. What divides the brothers is the six decades
each was convinced the other was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Lazar, 78, and Leonid, 79 -- Leibisch in his youth -- were
reunited through a program run by Israel's Holocaust memorial that
tracks down survivors of the ravages of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   They met at Yad Vashem on Wednesday, only the third time they
have met since Leonid made the call last month.
</P>
<P>
   Such reunions are very rare, Yad Vashem spokeswoman Lisa
Davidson said. In the last 15 years, there have been only about 4
cases of siblings who survived the Holocaust finding each other and
perhaps 100 instances in which cousins were reunited, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers last saw each other in their hometown of Tomaszow
in 1941, as the German army advanced on Soviet-occupied Poland. The
Red Army snapped up Leonid, who was draft age, and Lazar was
recruited into the ''youth groups'' deployed on work detail
throughout the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Lazar returned to Poland and Leonid was forced to
settle in Ukraine, where he worked in construction. Each tried hard
to track down his family.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist authorities were not helpful; Lazar remembered
being informed that an uncle was dead, only to find him alive and
well a few years later in a town just a day's journey away.
</P>
<P>
   Lazar heard from distant relatives that most of his immediate
family had been wiped out by the Nazis and their allies in the
Holocaust. Leonid learned nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Soon each brother became convinced he was the sole survivor of a
brood of five boys and a girl.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sure there was no one,'' Lazar said. He immigrated to
Israel in 1957 to start a new life.
</P>
<P>
   The longing for family would not leave him, and in the 1990s, at
the beginning of a wave of immigration from the collapsed Soviet
Union, his Israeli-born wife started asking around on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would overhear the name 'Sheiman,' and I would buttonhole
people and ask them where they were from,'' Orit Sheiman said. In
1991, on a day excursion to Jerusalem, she made Lazar stop by at
Yad Vashem and register his family's names.
</P>
<P>
   Leonid arrived here in 1995, but it was not until his daughter,
Alla, arrived this year that he turned to Yad Vashem -- she heard of
the program in a Hebrew language class and urged him to write a
letter.
</P>
<P>
   A Yad Vashem employee uncovered Lazar's information sheet,
recorded in a small, precise hand: ''Mother, Raizel, died in war;
father, Shlomo, died in war; brother, Leibisch, died in war.'' She
called Leonid, and he waited a week -- refusing to believe he had
found a brother, believing it was a gruesome coincidence. Finally,
he made the call.
</P>
<P>
   ''The brothers say they're nothing alike,'' Orit said, ''but the
kids notice the gestures, the expressions.''
</P>
<P>
   They sit and occasionally stare at each other, disbelieving;
they share the same tight smile as their mother bears in a
photograph Leonid carried for decades. ''I thought this picture was
all that remained of our family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look more like mother,'' Lazar interjected.
</P>
<P>
   Each crosses his right arm over his waist when relaxing. When a
visitor enters a room, they stand up at once and bow slightly, a
habit otherwise notable for its utter absence in Israel's informal
society.
</P>
<P>
   They speak in Russian -- ''Leonid has forgotten his Yiddish,
which is a shame,'' Lazar laments -- and remember walking to
synagogue on Saturdays, each grabbing one of their father's hands,
and torturing the rabbi at religions class with pranks. They recall
playing hooky at the river on a hot day, and fleeing a bombing raid
together.
</P>
<P>
   In private, a while later, Lazar regrets how his brother has
internalized the ''Russian mentality.'' Lazar has invested well and
lives a comfortable retirement in the upscale Tel Aviv suburb of
Herzliya; Leonid is happy with his $500 monthly pension in the drab
desert town of Kiryat Gat.
</P>
<P>
   ''He says he 'makes do','' Lazar said, raising his eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers are brothers, however, and Lazar said he intends on
making up for lost time. ''The circle is closed.''

price tag, congressional auditors say. The Energy Department told the General
Accounting Office the cost of the laser project at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in California has soared to $2.2 billion -- twice what it was
predicted to be in 1995. But the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said a
more accurate total is closer to $3 billion.

cloned. Separately, a Scottish company said it had cloned a litter of five pigs.
Work on the litter of pigs cloned by PPL Therapeutics Inc. of Scotland involved

economic policies which include slashing corporate tax rates and other measures

<HEADLINE> F. Lee Bailey's in Legal Trouble  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- F. Lee Bailey has made many a compelling
courtroom argument for clients during his 40-year legal career, but
he may have to save his most persuasive defense for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary attorney was to appear Thursday before a federal
judge to argue that he shouldn't be held in contempt and sent to
jail for refusing to turn over $2 million in legal fees that the
government claimed for itself.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing in U.S. District Court in Orlando comes weeks after
a judge in a separate case recommended to the Florida Supreme Court
that Bailey be disbarred for paying himself with millions in stock
that the government intended to seize from a client.
</P>
<P>
   Disbarment in Florida could jeopardize Bailey's right to
practice law in the only other state where he is licensed,
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's troubles have some colleagues wondering how the West
Palm Beach-based lawyer's storied career could be ending in such a
mess.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised by all that. He has had a long and distinguished
career,'' said Johnnie Cochran Jr., who along with Bailey was part
of the Dream Team that won O.J. Simpson's acquittal on murder
charges. ''It's a tough time for him and I think he deserves
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's difficult year has extended into his personal life as
well.
</P>
<P>
   His fourth wife, Patricia, and his mother died last year. He
testified in court last year that he is broke, in an attempt to
convince a judge he cannot repay the $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bailey who invented the modern celebrity lawyer in the
1960s and 1970s, when he was host of the TV show ''Good Company''
and wrote books such as ''The Defense Never Rests.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's law career began in 1960 when he was admitted to the
Massachusetts Bar after graduating with the highest grade point
average in the history of Boston University's law school. He had
previously dropped out of Harvard to serve as a Marine fighter
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey shot to fame in the 1960s defending in separate cases two
doctors accused of killing their wives. He won an acquittal for
George Elderly and won the reversal of a conviction for Sam
Sheppard in the celebrated case that inspired TV's ''The
Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Bailey won an acquittal for Ernest Medina, a soldier
who was tried for his role in the My Lai massacre during the
Vietnam War. He unsuccessfully defended Albert DeSalvo in the case
of the Boston Strangler, who murdered 13 women.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's most visible defeat was the conviction of Patty Hearst,
the newspaper heiress who was kidnapped by the Symbionese
Liberation Army and took part in several bank robberies.
</P>
<P>
   He is considered an expert on lie detector tests and aviation
litigation and holds a commercial pilot's license.
</P>
<P>
   ''I grew up on F. Lee Bailey as a kid. He's almost Perry
Mason,'' said Florida trial attorney Willie Gary, who last week won
a $240 million case against Disney.
</P>
<P>
   But Bailey's abrasive -- sometimes sneering -- courtroom style and
his penchant for attracting media attention have rubbed some judges
and other lawyers the wrong way. He was censured by the
Massachusetts Bar in 1970 for talking too much to the media and was
barred in 1971 from practicing in New Jersey for one year for
remarks he made on a case.
</P>
<P>
   ''His style causes the judges to treat him differently,'' Gary
said. ''Sometimes you catch more flies with honey than vinegar,
even when you're right.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would argue that Bailey's latest problems are
self-inflicted, the result of his efforts to secure legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   In the Orlando case, a federal magistrate in January recommended
that Bailey be found in contempt for taking $2 million from a
Cayman Island bank account in 1998. The money had belonged to
Bailey's former client William J. McCorkle, an infomercial pitchman
convicted of fraud, and was illegally earned and could be seized by
the government, the magistrate said.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, in court papers, called the recommendation ''heavily
flawed in virtually every area of its long odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a judge in Naples recommended that Bailey be
stripped of his license to practice law in Florida after finding
him guilty of misconduct and misappropriation. Bailey was accused
of inappropriately using millions of dollars in stock belonging to
a client, international drug trafficker Claude Duboc, to pay his
own legal expenses. In 1996, he spent 43 days in jail for contempt
of court stemming from the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey did not return calls for comment, but his lawyer in the
Orlando case, Richard Lubin, said: ''He believes that he is right
and believes that he hasn't violated the law or the ethics of the
state of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, ''he just keeps going forward,'' Lubin said.
''He's indomitable. He's a fighter.''

<HEADLINE> Cloned Pigs Seen As Organ Advance  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The cloned barnyard has a new resident: the
pig, a creature researchers say holds promise for growing organs to
replace ailing hearts, livers and kidneys in humans.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by Japanese and American researchers announced in the
journal Science that a single piglet had been cloned. Separately, a
Scottish company said it had cloned a litter of five pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pigs have an enormous potential for'' transplanting organs to
humans, said Tony Perry, a Rockefeller University researcher and
co-author of the Science study. ''This is a breakthrough toward
that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The pig, he said, is considered the best species to use for
growing organs to replace ailing hearts, livers and kidneys in
humans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pig organs roughly match the size of human adult organs,''
Perry said. ''They also are amiable to transplant surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Work on the litter of pigs cloned by PPL Therapeutics Inc. of
Scotland involved some of the same researchers who cloned a sheep
called Dolly. That was the first use of cells from an adult mammal
to clone another animal.
</P>
<P>
   The PPL success was reported in a study released electronically
Wednesday by the peer-reviewed British scientific journal Nature,
five months after the researchers made public their work in the
popular press.
</P>
<P>
   In the Science report, researchers said they cloned a single
piglet, named Xena, from the skin cells of a pig fetal.
</P>
<P>
   They removed the nucleus, which contains DNA, and injected it
into a pig egg from which the nucleus had been removed. An
electrical pulse stimulated the egg to grow into an embryo, which
was transplanted into a surrogate mother.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said four sows were transplanted with a total of
110 embryos. Xena was the only healthy animal produced.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's co-authors were scientists at the National Institute of
Animal Industry in Tusukuba, Japan, and the Prima Meatpackers in
Tsuchiura, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish company researchers began with cells from an adult
animal and cycled the transplanted nucleus through two different
pig eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dolly's birth in 1997, research teams have used similar
techniques to clone goats and cows. Dolly and some of the cloned
cows have given birth to normal offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said swine have proved harder to clone.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have been trying since 1986,'' he said. ''It has been
an elusive species, but one that people have really wanted to
succeed with.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Bishop, president of Infigen Inc. of DeForest, Wis.,
a cloning research company that has cloned more than 100 cows, said
the announcement by Perry and his co-authors is a ''real
breakthrough'' because it showed that problems with pig cloning
have been solved.
</P>
<P>
   Before pigs can be used to grow organs for human transplant,
Perry said scientists must overcome several problems, chief of
which is the human body's rejection of the transplant.
Cross-species transplants, he said, are usually ''rejected within
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be necessary to modify the genes of the pig so that
the transplanted organs will not be rejected,'' Perry said. ''This
would make the organ invisible so that the host immune system will
not recognize the organ as foreign.''
</P>
<P>
   It may take several generations of clones and ''many years'' to
weed out the genes that cause rejection, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers are concerned that using pig organs for
transplantation could cause humans to contract some unusual swine
viruses. These viruses have been infecting pigs for thousands of
generations and now are part of the swine genes, passed along from
parents to offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Another study in Nature showed that mice receiving pig tissue
transplants did become infected with a swine virus.

<HEADLINE> Prince William To Attend University  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prince William is to attend Scotland's St. Andrews
University to study art history after taking a year off to work and
travel, royal officials confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   St. James's Palace said William was ''delighted and relieved''
after being accepted by the university.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other British students, the 18-year-old prince
received the results of his final secondary-school exams -- called A
levels -- on Thursday. He received an A in Geography, a B in History
of Art and a C in Biology -- solid marks that surpassed those
obtained by his father, Prince Charles, and other members of the
royal family.
</P>
<P>
   William, currently taking part in exercises with the Welsh
Guards regiment in Belize, received a congratulatory e-mail from
his father, the palace said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know how hard William worked to achieve these excellent
results and I am very proud that he has done so well,'' Prince
Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   William, who graduated from Eton school this year, is to is to
study a four-year honors degree course. The topics he will be
taught include British furniture, architecture, Renaissance Italy
and modern art.
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrews, founded in 1411, is famed for its historic
buildings and the scarlet robes worn by its students on ceremonial
occasions. It boasts a secret society called the Kate Kennedy Club,
which was founded in 1926 to honor the niece of the university
founder Bishop Kennedy. Every year, male society members dress up
as women in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have every confidence that St. Andrews will offer Prince
William the opportunity to continue his education in a unique,
nourishing and challenging environment,'' the university said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is down four
points in today's early going. Advancers and decliners are evenly
split on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off fractionally and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index is up two points.
</P>
<P>
   Some good earnings news likely will provide some support for the

</P>
<P>
   Dow component Hewlett-Packard blew out expectations with its

yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But, the parent of United Airlines, UAL, is out with a warning
that its quarterly results will fall below earlier estimates.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there's little in the way of economic news.
And analysts expect the market to move cautiously ahead of next

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 17; Nasdaq Adds 15  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mixed Thursday, as fears of a
second-half profit slowdown continued to plague the markets.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 16.85 at 10,991.54.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.80 to 1,484.65, and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 14.51 at 3,875.71.
</P>
<P>
   The latest earnings scare arrived Thursday when analysts
forecasted a slowdown in computer giant Hewlett-Packard's
second-half profits.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard shares fell $10.562 to $109.438.
</P>
<P>
   A selloff in retail stocks dragged down the Dow index on
Wednesday as investors fretted that second-half profits could fall
short of expectations if consumer spending eases in step with the
Federal Reserve Board's policy of cooling the economy to fight
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Now those fears have apparently crept into the tech sector.
</P>
<P>
   Economic data released recently has signaled that the Fed's
strategy to slow the economy may be working.
</P>
<P>
   However, while a slowing economy may prevent the Fed from
raising interest rates, it also raises the specter of lower
second-half profits.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts consider the Fed's policy of cooling the economy
through higher interest rates a double-edged sword and are hoping
for what's referred to as a soft landing, meaning economic growth
eases but not so much that it hurts companies' bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, a
widely watched barometer for inflation, showed that consumer prices
rose a mild 0.2 percent last month, as the cost of gasoline eased
after soaring in June.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the economy is cooling, the Commerce
Department reported Wednesday that housing construction fell 3.3
percent in July to the lowest level in at least two years. It was
the third straight monthly decline.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 127.52 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 0.37 to 512.37.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.19 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.84 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.28 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.78 percent.

<HEADLINE> Rap Star Eminem Files for Divorce  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) -- Eminem has filed for divorce from
high school sweetheart Kim Mathers.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old rap star, whose real name is Marshall Mathers
III, asked a Macomb County Circuit Court judge to grant joint
custody of their 4-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Mathers, 25, had known for some time that Eminem had
prepared divorce papers, but she was not told in advance that he
was filing Wednesday, said her attorney, Neil Rockind. The papers
are dated June 22.
</P>
<P>
   The couple wed 14 months ago. Rockind said she had stayed in the
marriage for the sake of their daughter but now agrees to the
breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that she recognizes that this is an opportunity to
remove herself from a relationship that has been holding her
back,'' Rockind told the Detroit Free Press. ''This is no reason
for her to shed too many tears over a relationship with somebody
who obviously does not want her around.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockind said he did not know if the specter of divorce
contributed to Kim Mathers' July suicide attempt. The couple have
been separated since early June.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem publicist Dennis Dennehy said Eminem filed for divorce
because he was concerned about his wife's fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem was arrested June 4, accused of using an unloaded gun to
hit a man reportedly seen kissing Kim Mathers in the parking lot of
a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Em got married because he was trying to do the
American dream thing,'' former Eminem bodyguard Byron Williams told
The Detroit News. ''But unfortunately, sometimes it doesn't work
out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's current album, ''The Marshall Mathers LP,'' topped the
charts, and in February he won Grammy awards for rap album and solo
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce filing comes the same week that Eminem's mother,
Debbie R. Mathers-Briggs of St. Joseph, Mo., sued him for $1
million to supplement a $10 million defamation case she already has
pending.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 53; Nasdaq Adds 55  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were higher Thursday, as investors
sought out industries likely to escape an expected slowdown in
second-half corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   In midmorning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 53.39 at 11,061.78.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher.
</P>

   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 13.43 to 1,493.28, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 54.87 at 3,916.07.
</P>
<P>
   ''This market has been fairly lifeless recently. But if there's
been one theme -- and it's been hard to find one -- it's that
investors are concerned for earnings in the second half,'' said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've just gotten through the second quarter earnings period
and the numbers were very strong. But the picture is not going to
be as pretty in the third and fourth quarters. So investors are
trying to find those industries and companies that won't be
affected by the slowdown in the growth of earnings,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson cited semiconductors, communications equipment, drug
companies, electric utilities and the oil sector as areas investors
believe may emerge relatively unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest earnings scare arrived Thursday when analysts
forecasted a slowdown in Hewlett-Packard's second-half profits.
Shares of the number two U.S. computer maker fell $10.125 to
$109.875.

   ''The good news is that the Fed probably won't raise interest
rates,'' Johnson observed. ''But the bad news is that the rate of
earnings will slow and that's what investors are focusing on.''

   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York

Mormon bishop says law requiring clergy to report crimes unfair
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A Mormon bishop charged with failing to
report child sex abuse said it's unfair to expect him to act as a
police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce R. Christensen, who pleaded innocent earlier this month,
said Monday he plans to challenge a state law requiring clergy to
report crimes unless their sole knowledge comes from a
perpetrator's confession.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, if someone comes into my office, I need a sign above my
door saying, 'Anything you say, I have to report to the police,'''
Christensen said after a preliminary hearing in his first public
statement since being charged. ''It doesn't provide me as a
clergyman time to reflect and give counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Christensen is the second Salt Lake-area bishop to be charged
this year under the law, which has rarely been prosecuted in the
last decade. Bishop David West Maxwell of Sandy faces charges that
he failed to report when a teen-age girl told him she had been
sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Angela Micklos said the statute is fair and could not
recall it being challenged before.
</P>
<P>
   But Christensen's attorney, Bradley Rich, said forcing clergy to
run to the cops blurs the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen said one of the members of his Salt Lake 21st Ward
of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came to him
because her husband abused her. The bishop said he made
arrangements for the woman and her infant to stay at a women's
shelter and get an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The woman also allegedly told Christensen her husband behaved
''inappropriately'' with the little girl in the bathtub, but the
bishop said he did not believe he needed to report the comment.
Assemblies of God grows, largely outside United States
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Some 50,000 members of the Assemblies of
God, the world's largest Pentecostal church, gathered for their
first world congress held in the United States -- celebrating the
denomination's growth around the globe and noting that missionaries
are no longer exclusively white men from the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a demonstration that missions no longer is a domain of
the Northern Hemisphere,'' said Don Corbin, the U.S. church's
African regional director.
</P>
<P>
   Independent churches banded together in 1914 in Hot Springs,
Ark., adopting the name Assemblies of God. Since then aggressive
missionary work has carried the church's message far. Today only
2.5 million of the church's 32 million adherents are Americans,
compared with 17.2 million Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarus Chakwera, general superintendent of the 420,000-member
church in Malawi, described the efforts of missionaries to start an
Assembly of God church in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The easy places have already been taken, so whatever is
difficult, the Africans will do it,'' Chakwera said, bringing
cheers from the standing-room-only crowd of more than 400 people.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Kabore said missionaries from five African counties, along
with others from France and the United States, have worked for a
decade in the predominantly Muslim nation of Niger to build a
network of 10 churches with 1,700 members.
</P>
<P>
   The first two world congresses were held in Brazil and South
Korea. It was fitting to meet in the United States this year, said
Edith Blumhofer, director of the Institute for Study of American
Evangelicals at Wheaton College in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a way to bring it back home,'' she said, noting nearly a
century has passed since the founding of the modern Pentecostal
movement.

Islamic group rescinds invite to Malaysian leader in protest
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Islamic Society of North America has
rescinded its invitation to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohammad to address its annual convention in September because of
the trial and conviction of the country's former deputy prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The umbrella organization's members were distraught over a high
court's verdict against Anwar Ibrahim. On Aug. 7, he was convicted
of sodomy and sentenced to nine years in prison on top of the six
years he is already serving for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim, who was sacked by Mahathir and arrested in September
1998, denies the charges, saying they were trumped up by his
political enemies to end his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the strong protests we are receiving from our
members, we are unable to assure a favorable reception of the prime
minister,'' Sayed M. Syeed, the Islamic Society's secretary
general, wrote in a letter to the Malaysia's U.S. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted him to come here and address Muslims as a leader who
stands for justice ... Without any drastic change in his decision,
his presence will be a source of anger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Malaysian embassy in Washington confirmed that the prime
minister had accepted the invitation but declined further comment.
Catholic church officials in Mexico defend destroying
'sacrilegious' art
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO (AP) -- Mexico's Roman Catholic church came under harsh
criticism after church officials defended two men who destroyed a
drawing at an art exhibition, calling it sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   The vandalism at an art show Friday in the western state of
Jalisco revived fears that the July 2 electoral victory by the
socially conservative National Action Party may mark a return of
the church's once enormous power in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''The destruction of this drawing ... demonstrates extreme
intolerance and backwardness,'' the newspaper La Jornada wrote in
its main editorial Monday. It said the church hierarchy had started
''a crusade of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The drawing depicted one of Mexico's most celebrated religious
events -- the moment when an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe
appeared on a peasant's shawl in 1531 -- but the artist drew a naked
Marilyn Monroe where the Virgin would be.
</P>
<P>
   Two men identified as militant Catholics entered the gallery in
Guadalajara and tore the drawing to pieces. They were arrested on
charges of destruction of property, for which they face fines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It offended Christian principles, it offended the holy
Catholic religion and it offended all Mexicans,'' said one of the
suspects, Felipe de Jesus Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Norberto Rivera, archbishop of Mexico, called the
attack a ''logical reaction'' to the drawing's content.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the artist was the intolerant one, because he hurts
and laughs at religion but doesn't let the church defend itself,''
Rivera said. Another church official offered to pay the men's
fines.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic church's image has been marred in recent weeks by a
scandal involving bizarre exorcism rites in which women were beaten
and burned with candle wax in Puebla. A judge issued an arrest
warrant for a parish priest allegedly involved in that ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The church fought a bloody three-year uprising against
anti-clerical governments here in the 1920s. Restrictions on public
religious activities in place for decades were lifted in the 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 38; Nasdaq Adds 54  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were higher Thursday, as investors
sought out industries likely to escape an expected slowdown in
second-half corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 38.46 at 11,046.85.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 13.09 to 1,492.94, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 54.23 at 3,915.43.
</P>
<P>
   ''This market has been fairly lifeless recently. But if there's
been one theme -- and it's been hard to find one -- it's that
investors are concerned for earnings in the second half,'' said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've just gotten through the second-quarter earnings period
and the numbers were very strong. But the picture is not going to
be as pretty in the third and fourth quarters. So investors are
trying to find those industries and companies that won't be
affected by the slowdown in the growth of earnings,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson cited semiconductors, communications equipment, drug
companies, electric utilities and the oil sector as areas investors
believe may emerge relatively unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, shares of telecommunications parts maker Ciena
Corp. rose $10.50 to $173.75 on Thursday after the company
forecasted better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings based on
projected demand for fiber-optic parts.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement gave an across-the-board boost to Internet and
telecom equipment companies.
</P>
<P>
   The latest earnings scare came from Hewlett-Packard, however.
Two analysts expressed concern for the computer giant's second-half
profits, sending shares of the number two U.S. computer maker down
$11.50 to $108.50.
</P>
<P>
   A selloff in retail stocks dragged down the Dow index on
Wednesday as investors fretted that second-half profits could fall
short of expectations if consumer spending eases in step with the
Federal Reserve Board's policy of cooling the economy to fight
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economic data released recently has signaled that the Fed's
strategy to slow the economy may be working.
</P>
<P>
   However, while a slowing economy may prevent the Fed from
raising interest rates, it also raises the specter of lower
second-half profits.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts consider the Fed's policy of cooling the economy
through higher interest rates a double-edged sword and are hoping
for what's referred to as a soft landing, meaning economic growth
eases but not so much that it hurts companies' bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good news is that the Fed probably won't raise interest
rates,'' Johnson observed. ''But the bad news is that the rate of
earnings will slow and that's what investors are focusing on.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 405.34 million shares, down
from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 0.60 to 513.34.

<HEADLINE> Restrictions Eased on Israeli Arms  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The United States has drastically reduced its
demands for veto rights on Israeli arms sales now that Israel has
canceled the sale of a warning system to China and shown
flexibility with the Palestinians, according to a radio report
Thursday confirmed by U.S. and Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Israel canceled the sale of the PHALCON airborne early
warning system to China after the U.S. Congress threatened to
deduct the value of the sale from U.S. aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions over that sale led the United States to demand Israel
receive prior U.S. agreement on sales to 27 countries. That list
has now been reduced to four, army radio reported: China, India,
Pakistan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
the report and said that even in the case of those four, arms deals
will rarely be vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Yatom, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's political and security
adviser, confirmed that Israel and the United States held a series
of discussions on the arms issue in recent weeks and have made
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can confirm that the positions between us and the Americans
are not as far apart as they used to be,'' Yatom told army radio.
</P>
<P>
   The veto would seriously impede Israel's efforts to expand its
arms sales, coming in addition to an agreement that allows the
United States prior approval for sales of hardware made with U.S.
parts or know-how. Washington has vetoed sales of the Israeli Kfir
fighter plane, which has an American engine, to a number of
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The PHALCON is wholly Israeli, but Israel agreed to cancel the
sale because it is completely dependent on Washington for major
weapons systems such as fighter planes and attack helicopters, and
receives $1.9 billion each year in American military aid.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said China's having the advanced
detection system would increase the military threat to Taiwan and
other U.S. allies in Asia, and could conceivably threaten the lives
of American pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation was a major blow to Israel's hopes of
penetrating the lucrative Chinese arms market. The Chinese had
already obtained options on three more airborne PHALCON systems
with a price tag of $250 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's flexibility and willingness to consider American
proposals at the Camp David summit with the Palestinians also
contributed to the easing of the arms export restrictions, the U.S.
official said.

<HEADLINE> Secret Service Looks At Schools  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Long the guardian of America's presidents and
currency, the Secret Service is extending its expertise to a new
domain: the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   The agency believes that some of the methods that help thwart
potential assassins might also prevent Columbine-style violence.
</P>
<P>
   The project on how to identify youngsters who might turn violent
will be completed this fall. Agents from the Secret Service's
National Threat Assessment Center, including psychology experts,
have examined about 40 recent school shootings and interviewed
several of the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our schools are a fairly safe place to be, but the national
psyche has changed -- nobody still thinks 'It can't happen to me,'''
Secret Service Director Brian Stafford said in an interview this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of people looking for answers. We don't have
them all ... but there's no better organization to take the lead in
this area. It's what we do every day, and we're the best in the
world at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The final report, which will be made available to police and
school officials, will offer suggestions for early detection of
potentially threatening students. What it won't contain is any
profile of a typical school shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe in profiles,'' Stafford said. ''There are no
psychological or demographic profiles for the adults who pose
threats, and my guess is we're going to find the same thing in
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Vossekuil, the agent heading the project, noted that other
organizations and experts have compiled profiles or checklists
intended to help identify potentially violent students.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dilemma is that some are written so broadly that they're
overinclusive, and some written so narrowly that they're likely to
miss people educators should be concerned about,'' Vossekuil said.
''There's no one set of characteristics that describe a school
shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Vossekuil said some of the school shooters were
victims of bullying, others were not. Some were poor students,
others very bright.
</P>
<P>
   On some matters, the Secret Service findings are ambiguous. For
example, the attacks studied often were preceded by threatening
comments, but not necessarily a specific, direct threat toward the
eventual target. And though several shooters had psychological
problems, ''it's not as if they were overtly crazy,'' Vossekuil
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most useful findings, Stafford said, is that none of
the shooters acted ''in a spontaneous, impulsive manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been plenty of time to intervene,'' he said. ''But you
have to recognize the signs and have people in place to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooters did not necessarily convey any veiled warnings to
adults, Stafford said, ''but there was plenty of communication ...
diaries, Web sites, quite a few other children aware of the
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than profiling, the Secret Service focuses on behavior
and motives, tracing the shooter's thoughts and actions. It has
used similar methodology in dealing with potential assassins,
workplace violence and celebrity stalkers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're asking how he came to the point where he saw this as
some kind of solution,'' Vossekuil said. ''Is there potentially
discernible behavior that might aid in earlier detection?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the jailed youths interviewed by agents was Luke Woodham,
convicted of killing two students and wounding seven at Pearl High
School in Mississippi in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Woodham said he had a difficult childhood and
''felt like nobody cared.'' ''I just didn't have anyone to talk to
about all the things I was going through,'' he said. ''I kept a lot
of hurt inside me.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the project, Vossekuil and his colleagues have met in
various regions with school and police officials. On hand at a
seminar near Pittsburgh was Allegheny County police officer Mike
Spagnoletti, who works on anti-drug and anti-violence programs in
area schools.
</P>
<P>
   He was impressed by the agents' candor regarding profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's kid stuff and there's serious stuff, and you've got to
know the difference,'' Spagnoletti said. ''A kid dyes his hair
purple and dresses in black, that may be strange to you or me, but
it doesn't mean he's going to go out and kill somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading expert on children's mental health, Kevin Dwyer,
questioned whether the Secret Service could effectively shift its
focus from adult crime to student behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they all worked together to get rid of guns, we'd be better
off,'' said Dwyer, a former president of the National Association
of School Psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dwyer said he welcomes any effort that would bring
education, health and law enforcement officials together to prevent
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to teach all kids to be more reflexive than impulsive,
to cope better, to think before they act,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reopens Airport After 10 Years  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- After 10 years of a U.N. ban on flights to
Iraq, the international airport in Baghdad has reopened for
business -- with no aircraft, passengers or cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Transport and Communications Minister Ahmed Murtada Ahmed Khalil
said the Saddam International Airport and its facilities opened
Thursday. He said Iraq is ''expecting the arrival of aircraft''
from friendly countries, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela received a red-carpet welcome
at the airport last week when he was ferried there from the Iranian
border in President Saddam Hussein's helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez was the first head of state to visit Iraq since the 1991
Gulf War. President Abdurrhman Wahid of Indonesia has said he would
visit Baghdad in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   A 1990 U.N. Security Council resolution imposing, among other
things, a ban on flights to and from Iraq has been disputed but
invariably observed. Chavez did not violate the U.N. sanctions
because he crossed the border with Iran in a car.
</P>
<P>
   State-run newspapers have reported that French activists opposed
to the sanctions plan an embargo-busting flight to Baghdad next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The airport was last used for a commercial flight hours before
the outbreak of the Gulf War. Since then, only a few planes have
landed, mainly carrying humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq flew its fleet of 15 Boeing aircraft to Jordan, Tunisia and
Iran for safekeeping shortly before the war. Its efforts to bring
the jets home have failed and the planes now may be too old to fly.
</P>
<P>
   With no aircraft, the national carrier has kept its 2,300 staff
busy by selling food and drinks to the public or using airport
facilities to repair equipment and machines for both the state and
private sectors. Iraqi Airways offices in Baghdad have turned into
communications centers and food stores.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq views its expanding links with the outside world,
particularly through the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, as a
sign that the sanctions imposed on it for invading Kuwait in 1990
are crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Under the U.N. sanctions, Iraq is allowed to sell its oil
provided the proceeds go to food, medicine and other urgent needs.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. sanctions remain in place until Baghdad complies with U.N.
demands to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction and cooperate
fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Iraq reopened rail links with Syria, a traditional
Middle East foe -- another sign that trade ties between the two Arab
countries, ruled by rival factions of the Baath party, are
improving steadily.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro, Milosevic Parties Meet  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Putting aside bitter rivalries,
members of Montenegro's pro-Western government and opposition
parties loyal to President Slobodan Milosevic met Thursday to
discuss ways to avert conflict ahead of Yugoslav elections.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was the first in a year bringing together
high-ranking party officials from the ruling pro-Western Democratic
Party of Socialists and their bitter opponents and Milosevic
loyalists, the Socialist People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides agreed that it is absolutely necessary to preserve
peace as the primary condition for stability and the future of
Montenegro,'' the small republic's prime minister, Filip Vujanovic,
said after the three-hour talks.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions escalated in Montenegro after Milosevic scheduled Sept.
24 parliamentary and presidential elections. Yugoslavia is made up
of the dominant Serbia, Milosevic's power base, and Montenegro, a
republic of only 600,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The independence-minded Montenegrin leadership is calling for a
boycott of the elections on grounds that the ballot cannot be fair
after Milosevic changed the country's constitution and set new
election rules in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional changes also considerably weakened
Montenegro's clout in the two-house federal parliament. To take
part in the elections would, according to Montenegro's reformist
leadership, amount to ''giving legitimacy to efforts by the
Belgrade dictatorship to prolong its political survival.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The differences on the elections issue in Montenegro must not
be a cause for armed conflict,'' Vujanovic also said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were told the talks would continue, but no date was
given.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's (meeting) is the start of a dialogue that can be
successful only if the two parties seek sincere solutions in the
interest of Montenegro, its citizens and the union with Serbia,''
Predrag Bulatovic, a Milosevic ally, said earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition in Serbia says the Montenegrin boycott call plays
into Milosevic's hands, making it easier for pro-Milosevic parties
to take control of the 50 seats Montenegro holds in the Yugoslav
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's regime has accused the Montenegrin leadership of
working to break up Yugoslavia, and says the elections will be a
unique referendum on whether the country is to remain ''free'' or
be turned into a colony of the United States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences with Serbia, Montenegro's leaders have
hesitated to proclaim full independence.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic, the chief Milosevic foe,
fears armed clashes between the bitterly divided blocks in
Montenegro should independence be formally declared.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Injure 19 in Latvia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Two bombs exploded in a popular department
store in Riga on Thursday evening, injuring at least 19 people,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Krists Leiskalns said the bombs went off
minutes apart at the downtownn Centrs department store.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of criminal police, Valdis Pumpers, was among those
injured, but police said they did not believe he was the target of
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   No warnings or threats were reported before the explosions, and
police knew of no motive for the bombings, Leiskalns said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been scores of bombings in Riga since Latvia regained
independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, although injuries or
deaths have been rare. Police have attributed most of the blasts to
gangland activity.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Hostage Release Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Government negotiators scrambled
Thursday to put the release of Western hostages held by Muslim
rebels back on track after President Joseph Estrada rejected a plan
that would have left three French journalists still in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather Thursday also prevented the negotiators from flying
to Jolo, a remote southern island where Abu Sayyaf rebels are
holding the captives in jungle hide-outs.
</P>
<P>
   Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado, who until
Thursday was willing to settle for an initial release of the nine
Western tourists, said Estrada insisted that the three TV
journalists be released at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ''He reminded me of his instruction that the negotiating panel
should work for the release of everybody,'' Aventajado said. As a
result of the shift, ''we need an extra day to do all the
preparations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are expected to release all 28 hostages, including
the tourists and the journalists, between Friday and Monday, said
Aventajado, who was to meet Friday with ambassadors from the
foreign hostages' countries.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages include three French, three Malaysians, two
Germans, two Finns, two South Africans and one Filipino still in
captivity from the original group of 21 people abducted April 23
from Malaysia's Sipadan diving resort. The rebels later seized the
three French journalists and a dozen Filipino Christian evangelists
who visited the rebels' hide-out to pray for the Sipadan hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's meeting with the ambassadors was called after the
rebels apparently made new demands for the release of the
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Other last-minute negotiations involve security arrangements for
the hostages' turnover, officials said. Negotiators want to ensure
that the hostages and government officials are not attacked by
armed groups on the island, while the rebels fear they may be
targeted by the military.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the rebels released Lucrecia Dablo, a Filipino
cook who worked at Sipadan. She was the first hostage to be freed
since the release of six Malaysians and one German last month.
</P>
<P>
   About $5.5 million was paid for those releases, according to
military estimates. The large ransoms have led to fears of an
increase in future kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has played a high-profile role in the negotiations for the
Western hostages and is believed to be paying millions of dollars
for their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Former Libyan Ambassador Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, a member of the
Philippine negotiating panel, has denied reports that Libya is
paying as much as $25 million to the rebels and says his country
will fund development projects in the southern Philippines instead.
</P>
<P>
   Libya hopes its prominent role in freeing the hostages will
enhance its international image. It plans to fly the Western
hostages to Tripoli to meet with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
before they return to their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   Libyans have been pleased with their government's efforts to
release the hostages, saying they prove their country is not a
terrorist state as some Western countries charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good step by my country and an act that makes me
more honorable,'' said el-Hadi Mohammed, a 53-year-old taxi driver.
''Western media always say that Libya is a terrorist state and this
proves the opposite.''

<HEADLINE> Judges Switched Tripp Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three federal judges appointed by President
Clinton took a lawsuit filed by Linda Tripp away from a Reagan
appointee, and randomly assigned the case by computer to one of
themselves, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   The three, Emmet Sullivan, Paul Friedman and Gladys Kessler, run
the calendar committee that controls the docket at the U.S.
District Courthouse. In a five-page order dated Aug. 11, they said
the year-old Tripp suit never should have been directed to U.S.
District Judge Royce Lamberth.
</P>
<P>
   The court sent a copy of the ruling to Tripp's lawyers
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan is now overseeing the lawsuit. It ended up in his hands
as a result of the calendar committee's decision to put the Tripp
case through a computer process that randomly selects judges for
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Odds favored the case going to a Clinton appointee,
notwithstanding the random nature of the computerized selection
process, because nine of the 13 judges in the federal courthouse
were appointed by Clinton. Three are Republican appointees and one
was appointed by President Carter, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to remove the case from Lamberth's control comes
amid a judicial investigation into why the chief federal judge in
the District of Columbia, Norma Holloway Johnson, bypassed the
computer system and directed half a dozen criminal prosecutions of
campaign fund-raisers and friends of Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore to Clinton-appointed judges.
</P>
<P>
   The Judicial Council, which oversees judges' conduct, took the
rare step of hiring a former U.S. attorney to investigate the
matter. That investigation is in its fourth month. The Associated
Press first reported Johnson's decision to bypass the random
assignment system last year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson directed several of the fund-raising prosecutions to
Friedman, one of the three judges who took the Tripp case away from
Lamberth.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has said politics played no role in the decision, saying
she was simply directing complex cases to judges who had more time.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the Tripp suit away from Lamberth, the three judges
promoted the same random assignment policy that Johnson abandoned
in the criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Randomly assigning cases ''avoids public perception or
appearance of favoritism in assignments, and reduces opportunities
for judge-shopping,'' they wrote. The purpose of random assignments
''is to ensure greater public confidence in the integrity of the
judicial process,'' they added.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Tripp's lawsuit out of Lamberth's courtroom was a
victory for the Clinton administration and Pentagon spokesman Ken
Bacon. Tripp, a Pentagon employee, is suing Bacon and the
administration as a result of the release of information from her
personnel records to The New Yorker magazine at the height of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's surreptitious tape recordings of the former White House
intern confiding a sexual relationship with Clinton triggered the
impeachment crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth has been critical of the Clinton administration. He
ruled in March that the president had committed a criminal
violation of the Privacy Act by releasing his private
correspondence with Kathleen Willey to cast doubt on her allegation
that Clinton had made an unwelcome sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the reassignment of Mrs. Tripp's case from Judge
Lamberth to another judge is prejudicial and will result in
unnecessary work and duplication by the new judge assigned to Mrs.
Tripp's case,'' her attorneys argued.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's lawyer, William Murphy, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself called attention to the fact that Lamberth was
handling several lawsuits filed by a conservative legal group and
frequent Clinton critic, Judicial Watch, against his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth ''does seem to have somehow acquired a significant
percentage of the cases involving the White House'' and ''that's an
interesting story,'' Clinton told a news conference last spring.
</P>
<P>
   In September, when Tripp's lawyers filed the lawsuit, they asked
that the case be given to Lamberth on the grounds that it was
related to a Judicial Watch suit involving hundreds of former
appointees from Republican administrations whose FBI background
files were collected by the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Related cases ordinarily are assigned to the same judge to
ensure the most efficient use of judicial resources.
</P>
<P>
   But the three Clinton judges said the two cases ''are quite
different,'' with the FBI files matter being a class action
alleging a broad pattern of White House and FBI abuse and the Tripp
case involving a single plaintiff and one incident.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's lawyers said they'll fight the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is overwhelming evidence demonstrating that the Clinton
administration illegally leaked information from Mrs. Tripp's
security file and subjected her to an unprecedented smear campaign
because she blew the whistle on illegal conduct committed by
President Clinton and others,'' Tripp's lawyers said in their
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's lawsuit alleges the government released to The New
Yorker information showing Tripp stated on a security clearance
form that she had never been arrested, when in fact she had. She
was arrested for grand larceny when she was a teen-ager and pleaded
innocent. A judge disposed of the case by reducing the charge to
loitering.

<HEADLINE> Huge Tumor Removed From Man's Jaw  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Dieuvius Morancy told doctors he had been living
with the football-sized tumor protruding from his face for two,
maybe three, years.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Doctors at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial
Hospital spent 10&AMP;frac12; hours removing the 18-inch tumor Tuesday from
the 37-year-old Haitian peasant farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect he will be requesting a mirror at some point,'' Dr.
Eric Carlson said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The benign tumor probably began growing 20 years ago and
originated from the same cells that ordinarily form teeth, doctors
said. But for unknown reasons, the tumor, called an ameloblastoma,
began growing inside of Morancy's jaw instead.
</P>
<P>
   It caused Morancy's trachea to shift to the left, making it
difficult for him to swallow and at times speak.
</P>
<P>
   Morancy came to the United States after meeting doctors from
Atlanta visiting Haiti on a medical mission earlier this year. The
doctors feared Morancy might die without treatment and arranged
free medical visits and surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of making a connecting flight to Atlanta, Morancy
got off the plane from Port-au-Prince in Miami on July 30 and ended
up at Jackson Memorial Hospital, where he is also being treated for
severe anemia and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors declined to say how much the procedure cost, but guessed
the patient would not be charged.
</P>
<P>
   They are now examining the tumor and they have taken tissue
samples from around Morancy's face and neck to make sure portions
of it aren't lingering.
</P>
<P>
   So far all indications are that the tumor has been completely
removed and that Morancy will be cured, though he may not look
completely normal, Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hope here is that we will be satisfied with the appearance
and that the patient will be satisfied with the way he looks as
well,'' Carlson said.

   LONDON (AP) -- Daryl Hannah will take on the role made famous by
Marilyn Monroe in ''The Seven Year Itch'' -- but don't expect to get

   The West End stage production won't recreate the 1955 movie's

recently shed their clothes for London theatergoers.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hulk Hogan Files Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Hulk Hogan has filed a defamation suit against
the World Championship Wrestling, accusing the WCW's creative
director of berating him on national television after a ring
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Hogan won the July 9 bout in Daytona
Beach, Fla., by default when his opponent refused to wrestle, but
the WCW's Vince Russo followed Hogan from the ring, accused him of
''playing politics'' and implied he is dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   WCW spokesman Alan Sharp declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some have speculated that the lawsuit might be a publicity
stunt, as part of a continuing story line in which the WCW has
sought to eliminate older wrestlers such as Hogan as it tries to
revive flagging ratings. Hogan has not appeared on WCW programs
since the lawsuit was filed Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real lawsuit,'' said Hogan's attorney, John Taylor
Jr. What Russo said ''was defamatory and a breach of contract.''

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Oprah Winfrey settled her court fight with two
photographers on Wednesday, agreeing to share the rights to
pictures that appeared in a fitness book she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the settlement were kept secret under court order,
and Winfrey didn't comment afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Natkin and Stephen Green had sued the talk show host after
11 pictures they took appeared in her 1996 best seller ''Make the

</P>
<P>
   Natkin and Green said that the photos were publicity shots for
''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' and that Winfrey wasn't authorized to
use the pictures in a book without paying more money. Winfrey
contended that the money she paid for the shots entitled her to use
them as she saw fit.
</P>
<P>
   Natkin, who specializes in photographing rock bands, testified
Tuesday that he didn't sue for money, just for control of his
photos.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Increase Submarine Fleet  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Cold War threat of all-out nuclear war has
long since faded. Submarine operations remain potentially
hazardous. Does the United States really need more submarines
lurking beneath the surface of the world's oceans?
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says yes, but not because it expects to use them to
launch nuclear missiles across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The role of submarines like the Russian vessel that sank in the
Barents Sea is changing, largely to take advantage of their
inherent ''stealth'' in avoiding detection while playing the role
of silent and unseen spy.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say the subs are Cold War relics in search of a
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't even attempt to justify it on the basis of a
war-fighting capability,'' said Eugene Carroll of the private
Center for Defense Information.
</P>
<P>
   A retired Navy admiral and frequent critic of the service,
Carroll is contemptuous of the argument that a bigger submarine
fleet is needed for intelligence purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's contrived,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is considering a 20 percent increase in the
submarine fleet -- from 56 attack subs today to 68 by the year 2015
-- and it is spending tens of billions of dollars on a new
generation of attack subs, called the Virginia-class submarine.
This commitment comes a decade after Congress halted the Navy's
building of new Seawolf attack submarines at three instead of the
planned 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia-class subs will play a variety of roles, with
special emphasis on intelligence gathering and ''special
operations'' such as search and rescue, reconnaissance, sabotage
and diversionary attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian sub fleet, once the largest in the world, has not
evolved so much as it has eroded. Its numbers have dropped from
about 200 during the Cold War to about 20 today, including 11 Oscar
II-class submarines of the type that sank in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a lack of resources for training, maintenance and
modernization, Russian submarines spend far more time in port than
they do at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has pared its submarine fleet in the past
decade as it has reduced the overall military. The Navy now is
pushing to reverse that peacetime trend by arguing that
intelligence-collection demands have grown far beyond what the
current fleet of 56 nuclear-powered attack subs can handle.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy also has 18 Trident submarines armed with
intercontinental ballistic missiles. These behemoths, based at
Bangor, Wash., and King's Bay, Ga., form one leg of the U.S.
''triad'' of strategic nuclear weapons, along with long-range
bombers and ICBMs based in underground silos.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy is considering converting four Tridents from their
strategic nuclear role to a specialized combination of missions:
firing non-nuclear cruise missiles like the Tomahawks used in last
year's Kosovo air war; transporting Navy SEAL commandos, and
possibly launching unmanned surveillance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   It is the intelligence mission, however, that the Navy sees as
the main argument for rebuilding the sub force.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Frank L. Bowman, director of naval nuclear propulsion, said
in a recent interview with Pentagon reporters that the number of
''intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance'' missions --
essentially spy missions -- has doubled over the past 10 years while
the number of submarines has been cut almost in half.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we will ever be able to make do with fewer
subs'' than currently planned, Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of U.S. attack subs has declined from 93 in 1991, the
year the Soviet Union dissolved, to 56 today, with an additional
seven Los Angeles-class attack subs scheduled to be decommissioned.
Bowman said the Navy is leaning toward retaining four of those
seven by refueling their reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines still have a war-fighting mission, and that was the
role the Russian sub Kursk was practicing when it sank last weekend
during a major exercise with a Russian aircraft carrier and other
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, two American submarines were nearby,
watching the exercise from the icy waters of the Barents Sea, a
major thoroughfare from the big Russian naval port at Murmansk on
the Kola Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, the main purpose of shadowing Soviet
submarines was to watch for indications of preparations for
starting World War III. The same was true of Soviet subs monitoring
the U.S. coasts. Warning of surprise attack was a precious
commodity, and subs were a critical part of that effort.
</P>
<P>
   But with fear of a global nuclear conflict almost gone, navies
have not lost their love of submarines. A growing number of nations
are acquiring subs -- powered by diesel and electric power, rather
than nuclear power like those of the American and Russian boats --
to flex muscle in or near their home waters.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, for example, has contracted with Germany to buy three
Dolphin diesel-powered subs. The first was delivered last year.
Iran has a small submarine force, which U.S. military officials
have said provides a mine-laying capability in the Gulf that
worries them. One of Iran's main suppliers has been Russia, which
also has sold diesel-electric Kilo-class submarines to China in
recent years and has sold sub salvage to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon estimates there are about 600 submarines in the
world's waters today.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Blow Up Police Car  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Rebels blew up a police car in Chechnya's
capital, killing two civilians as the province prepared to elect a
deputy to parliament, the military said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Four Russian police officers were wounded in the attack
Wednesday evening in Grozny, the military command was quoted by
Interfax as saying. The car had been filled with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The police had been checking polling stations and sweeping
Grozny for rebels as part of heightened security ahead of Sunday's
elections for a member of Russia's parliament from Chechnya,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal forces have been unable to prevent rebels from staging
attacks and planting mines deep in Russian-controlled territory in
recent days. Gunmen fired at the home of one of the 13 parliament
candidates Wednesday, though no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo warned that the rebels, who
insist Chechnya is not part of Russia, were planning attacks to
disrupt the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation in Chechnya is complicated but controllable,''
Rushailo said in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Early voting has already started in some areas, including those
where Russian troops are based. Parliamentary elections took place
in the rest of Russia last December, when federal forces and rebels
were engaged in fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Russia still doesn't control all of Chechnya,
officials had promised a legislator would be elected this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees in neighboring Ingushetia, who are also eligible to
vote from their camps, know almost nothing about the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''What election? Putin was elected. What else do they want from
us?'' asked 50-year-old Malika Sutisheva, referring to Russian
President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is insulting for Chechnya and its citizens. When one-third
of Chechens live beyond the territory of Chechnya, it is absurd to
elect a parliament deputy from it,'' said Ruslan Salbiyev, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two servicemen were killed in Chechnya over the past week
and 79 wounded, the Defense Ministry said Thursday. That brings the
official count of Russians killed since the start of fighting in
the region to 2,625, though independent observers say the toll is
much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Russian fighter planes and helicopter gunships flew 42 missions
over the past 24 hours, targeting the Vedeno gorge that cuts
through the mountains in southeast Chechnya, the military said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops withdrew from Chechnya in defeat at the end of a
1994-96 war, then moved back in last September to end the
republic's de facto independence. The campaign came after
cross-border raids by Islamic militants based in Chechnya last
August and subsequent bombings in Russia that Moscow blamed on the
rebels.

<HEADLINE> World Youth Day in Rome  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Twenty-three-year-old Pawel Matusik figures he's
picked the best seat in the house for Rome's World Youth Day: St.
Peter's Square itself.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the expected 1 million-plus young Catholic
pilgrims bunk down in convents and classrooms, Matusik and six
Polish buddies who made the bus trip from Krakow chose to set up
outside Pope John Paul II's very own house.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why? Look!'' Matusik said, gesturing at the floodlit marble
basilica glowing before his sleeping bag. ''This place is
beautiful!''
</P>
<P>
   With masses of young people streaming in from around the world,
the week of Youth Day events is drawing the largest and most
exuberant crowds of the Roman Catholic Church's 2000 Holy Year.
</P>
<P>
   It is a moment that Rome has spent years and hundreds of
millions of dollars preparing for. The city has scrubbed its
facades, polished its paintings and freshened its frescoes until it
looks better now than it has for millennia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rome is a beautiful city, and they are beautiful young
people,'' bar worker Franco Abbruzzetti said, nodding approvingly
at crews picking up some of the 900 tons of trash collected by
midweek. ''Rome is worthy of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it's as if the host spiffed up the place, turned the
keys over to the guests, and left.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have taken over Rome, in the happiest sense of the
word,'' Mayor Francesco Rutelli said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 million of Rome's 3 million people have hit the
beach for Italy's traditional mid-August vacation, leaving the
90-degree-plus streets and the fountains in which to recover from
them to the pilgrim hordes.
</P>
<P>
   It's an influx of biblical proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The Circus Maximus, where seven times around made a chariot race
for the likes of Ben-Hur, stands transformed from its modern role
as a daytime dog run and nighttime teen passion pit into a giant al
fresco confession booth.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, 1,200 priests fluent in 50 languages from Italian to
Swahili hear up to 15,000 confessions. And some of 20,000
volunteers roamed the dusty track with back-mounted water
canisters, ready to spray the sweaty.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of Youth Days past -- John Paul started the tradition 15
years ago, bringing it home to Rome for Holy Year -- say
organization is off somewhat compared to previous events.
</P>
<P>
   Meals and Masses spread out among Rome's many basilicas leave
the flag-waving throngs miles to either walk or negotiate by
pilgrim-packed public buses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's people-to-people, wall-to-wall, from pickup to drop
off,'' said Catherine Trojack, a high school student from St. Paul,
Minn.
</P>
<P>
   But Trojack, standing in line outside St. Peter's for the trip
through the Holy Door, had no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe I'm 15 years old and already seen the pope,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But religious sites aren't the only places drawing crowds; lines
at the city's McDonald's restaurants stretch out the doors as well.
</P>
<P>
   However well-regarded by the world at large, Italian food wasn't
cutting it with American teens accustomed to fast food, or
Seychelles young people accustomed to meat and rice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait until I get home and have American food,'' said
Derek Vaughn, 17, of Montrose, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Like what?
</P>
<P>
   ''Pizza!'' Vaughn and his friends exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   To get to Rome, Youth Day participants did everything from sell
pastries on the street corners of Puerto Rico every Sunday for 18
months -- as 20-year-old Audi Robles did -- to give exhibitions of
Scotland's traditional ceilidh dance -- as 16-year-old James Smith
and his friends from Glasgow did.
</P>
<P>
   The week ends with a sleepout in a field outside Rome under the
stars before a Sunday Mass with John Paul. Until then, there are
catechisms, confessions, Masses and wandering. Finding places to
sleep was a bit of a challenge -- as the pilgrims poured in, church
groups found them beds in homes, convents -- wherever. Matusik and
his friends slept near St. Peter's by choice.
</P>
<P>
   By night, there are gatherings in piazzas, where the young
people can pick up the dances and songs of other pilgrims from
Spain, South America, Uganda or Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had known we were going to sleep here we would have
packed differently -- like air mattresses,'' said the Rev. John
Torrance, looking at a classroom full of young Canadians struggling
out of sleeping bags. It was one of 500 schools Rome commandeered
to house pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the kind of days they're having, by the time they get to
bed every night, it doesn't matter,'' Torrance said. ''They could
sleep anywhere.''

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Lee Has Anwar Opinion  </HEADLINE>
By SEAN YOONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- In unusually frank remarks,
Singapore's elder statesman on Thursday criticized the way Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad handled his former protege's downfall as
''a series of blunders.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for speaking his mind, Lee Kuan Yew spoke at a news
conference at the end of his first trip to neighboring Malaysia in
a decade. But ultimately, Lee said, his sympathies lay with
Mahathir -- not his imprisoned former deputy premier, Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar was sentenced last week to nine years in prison after
being convicted of sodomy, a term he will begin after finishing the
six years he is serving on a corruption conviction. Anwar maintains
the charges were designed to destroy him and end his challenge to
Mahathir's 19-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and Mahathir hold authoritarian views of leadership, though
both countries have democratic systems, and the Singaporean senior
minister expressed sympathy for Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an unmitigated disaster, and I felt more sorry for Dr.
Mahathir than I felt for Anwar,'' Lee said. ''I think that Dr.
Mahathir paid a very heavy price. He made an error of judgment,
several errors of judgment, which I felt were most unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them, Lee said, was arresting Anwar under the Internal
Security Act shortly after sacking him as deputy in September 1998
following disputes over how to handle the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The act is a British colonial-era relic in both Singapore and
Malaysia, created for fighting terrorism. It allows for people to
be detained without charge and both countries have invoked it on
occasion against government opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Using it against Anwar after he led a street demonstration
calling for political reform was widely seen abroad as
heavy-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why did you arrest him under the ISA?'' Lee recalled asking
when the two met at an economic meeting in Europe in 1999. ''How
can he be a national security threat? I was flabbergasted.''
</P>
<P>
   After Anwar's convictions, the verdicts were criticized abroad
by human rights groups and leaders including Vice President Al
Gore. The view that Anwar was being persecuted was reinforced when
he was beaten in custody by a national police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Lee called the handling of the case ''a series of blunders.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry for Anwar, too,'' Lee said. ''He was set as the
deputy to take over, and now, all these things have happened,
damaging both of them. It's just sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee also said he had a positive relationship with Mahathir,
Asia's longest-serving leader, despite their nations' often prickly
ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can speak quite frankly to each other,'' he said. ''We are
of the same generation, we've been through similar experiences.''

<HEADLINE> Arctic City Ponders Fate of Sub  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) -- Rumors about the sailors trapped in a
crippled Russian submarine on the sea floor circulate constantly in
the offices, shops and homes of this Arctic port that glories in
its ties to the navy.
</P>
<P>
   With little reliable information, people lurch between hope and
despair as they trade thirdhand reports. In a city full of active
navy personnel and veterans, the mood is tinged by knowledge of how
merciless the sea can be.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is happening now is such a tragedy that I wouldn't wish
it on my enemy,'' said Viktor Duben, a 30-year veteran of the
submarine service.
</P>
<P>
   There was no news Thursday about the 118 men trapped since
Saturday at the bottom of the Barents Sea aboard the Kursk, one of
the newest and most powerful nuclear submarines in the Russian
navy. The Kursk belongs to the Northern Fleet, which is
headquartered in the Murmansk region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only a small group of people really knows what's going on,''
said Valery Chushenkov, a retired submarine captain who is director
of a naval history museum. ''And the rest of us -- we just listen to
the news all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of those aboard the Kursk complain that even the hot
line the navy set up for the crisis is useless.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been calling the hot line ... every day, and they are
telling us they have no information. They say 'Go to Murmansk and
ask journalists,''' said Ludmila Milyutina of St. Petersburg.
Milyutina, whose son Andrei is on the Kursk, came to Mumansk on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Murmansk stretches for 11 miles along the Kola Bay, with navy
bases dotting the area. The gray concrete apartment blocks on the
hills are home to many who served in the navy or have friends or
relatives who still serve.
</P>
<P>
   With the brief Arctic summer giving way to the first damp, chill
stirrings of winter, many people's minds are on the cold inside the
Kursk, which probably has not had heat or light since it sank.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like this kind of weather, only it's dark,'' said Duben,
the retired submariner. He huddled in his padded jacket, pulling
his wool cap down over his ears, as he stood in a light drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Submarine crews usually have warm clothes stored for
emergencies, but crew members may not have had time to fetch them.
The navy said some sections of the Kursk are flooded.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are cold now, and have no lights,'' said Vyacheslav
Olnev, a factory worker who also served on a submarine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I watched the news five or six times yesterday, worrying all
the time,'' he said. ''I hope they are still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Duben said he spends most of his time trying to figure out what
could have gone wrong when the Kursk plunged to the bottom during
naval exercises. The navy said probes revealed massive damage to
the front of the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know nothing about what happened with the submarine. But it
was something terrible,'' Duben said.
</P>
<P>
   Murmansk's St. Nicholas church has held special services to pray
for the crew. Worshippers light candles in front of icons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pray every day, morning and night, for their rescue,'' said
Vladimir Dolinin, a 45-year-old bus driver.
</P>
<P>
   The local branch of the Soldiers' Mothers Committee, which works
for servicemen's rights, extended its hours to serve relatives of
the Kursk's crew.
</P>
<P>
   Like other people here, Valentina Fomina of the mother's
committee criticized the Russian government for delaying requests
for foreign help. On Wednesday, four days after the accident, the
Russian government asked Britain and Norway to send a
mini-submarine and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts that the military was wasting time by rejecting
foreign assistance,'' she said. ''It's frightening that, even
knowing they could not save the people themselves, they were
refusing help.''

<HEADLINE> US Steel Companies Ruled Against  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Circular seamless stainless pipes imported
from Japan are not hurting American steel companies, the U.S.
International Trade Commission ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a 4-2 decision, the panel dismissed the complaint of six U.S.
steelmakers and the United Steelworkers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Circular seamless stainless pipes are used in nuclear and
conventional power plants, stock lines for petrochemical
facilities, pharmaceutical production lines and food processing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Hidenori Tazawa, chairman of the Japan Steel Information Center,
said of the ruling: ''It was clear from the facts that U.S. mills
have been unable to meet the demand for this product, and that
imports are essential.''
</P>
<P>
   United Steelworkers spokesman Gary Hubbard said the decision
demonstrates why strong laws are needed to protect American
companies from unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
   According to the petition, Japanese exports of seamless
stainless pipes to the United States surged 43 percent from 1996 to
1998 while the average U.S. customs value of these imports on the
basis of volume declined 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision follows a March ruling by the Commerce
Department that the steel is sold in the United States at less than
fair market value. Both the Commerce Department and ITC must rule
against a foreign producer before penalties are imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen companies produce circular seamless stainless steel
hollow products at facilities in Arkansas, California, Delaware,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was filed by: Altx, Inc., American Extruded
Products, DMV Stainless USA Inc., Pennsylvania Extruded Tube Co.,
Salem Tube, Inc., Sandvik Steel Co., International Extruded
Products LLC and the United Steelworkers of America.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Mum on Pentagon Sub Offer  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian government officials have not
responded to Defense Secretary William Cohen's offer to provide
U.S. military assistance to the stricken Russian submarine, the
Pentagon said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter delivered to Russian officials Tuesday, Cohen
expressed concern for the fate of the 118 crew members aboard the
Kursk, which sank to the bottom of the frigid Barents Sea on
Saturday. ''My department stands ready to provide any assistance
you need; please do not hesitate to ask,'' Cohen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A Cohen spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, said Cohen received
no response, although the crew of a U.S. deep-water rescue vessel
based near San Diego is prepared to go to the scene if the Russians
ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton discussed the matter with President Vladimir
Putin in a telephone call Wednesday and offered U.S. assistance.
That same day the Russian military requested help from Britain,
which has a mini-submarine en route to the scene, and Norway, which
is preparing to send a team of divers.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said it remained possible that the United States could
provide help if the Russians asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's never too late,'' Quigley said. ''If the Russians feel
that there is something that the United States or any other nation,
for that matter, could provide to assist in the rescue of the crew
members, we're very confident that they will say so. And we'll do
our very best to provide that, whatever that might be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman also said the United States has ''heard
no form of communication'' from the crippled Russian submarine
since it went down, although he later said, ''We have no direct
knowledge as to whether or not there's been tapping or any other
form of communication with the crew members of the submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. surface ship with sophisticated listening devices was
positioned a couple hundred miles from the scene of the accident at
the time, Quigley said, but he would not say what, if anything, it
has heard.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Thursday that U.S. sensors in the area detected two explosions from
the stricken submarine at the time of the accident. Officials
earlier this week said one explosion had been heard. It remains
unclear what caused the explosions.

<HEADLINE> Remains in Korea May Be US Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. forensics specialists excavating sites in
North Korea recovered remains believed to be those of 14 American
servicemen missing in action from the Korean War, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The remains are to be flown aboard a U.S. Air Force plane from
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, to Yokota Air Base near Tokyo
on Saturday for a United Nations Command repatriation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The remains will then be taken to the Army Central
Identification Laboratory at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, for
forensic examination and positive identification.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 sets of remains are the most recovered in a single
operation since excavations began in 1996, when communist North
Korea first agreed to allow U.S. searches on its territory.
Twenty-six sets of remains have been recovered so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8,100 U.S. servicemen are still listed as missing from
the 1950-53 war, although remains of fewer than half that number
are believed to be recoverable.

<HEADLINE> Deposed Fiji Premier Visits India  </HEADLINE>
By NIRMALA GEORGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BHU JAMALPUR, India (AP) -- Jostling crowds, dancers, flags and
flowered arches welcomed deposed Fijian Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry on Thursday to the village of his ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Bhu Jamalpur, who held nightlong vigils and
offered prayers during Chaudhry's 56 days as a prisoner in a coup
in Fiji, finally greeted their hero.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, who was the first ethnic Indian to lead Fiji, is now
on an international tour to generate pressure on the new government
to restore democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He was treated as a cult figure in the village his grandfather
left behind in 1912 -- one of thousands of Indians the British took
as indentured servants to Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   The village of thatch-roofed and concrete-block homes was
festooned with flowered arches, flags and banners welcoming
Chaudhry, who was driven into Bhu Jamalpur with his wife, Viramati.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am touched by the tumultuous, spontaneous and heartwarming
welcome,'' Chaudhry said.
</P>
<P>
   Women in colorful skirts covered their faces with long scarves
and jostled for a look at Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   The receptions and meetings in Haryana state, west of New Delhi,
brought Chaudhry sadness and joy. ''Joy because I have been hailed
as a son of Haryana,'' he said. ''Sadness because it is happening
in such unfortunate circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his election and inauguration as the head of a
multiracial government on Fiji, Chaudhry was toppled in a May 19
coup by businessman George Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Speight released Chaudhry and other government officials held
hostage only after the president and the military agreed to laws
that removed equal rights for Fijians of Indian origin.
</P>
<P>
   Speight is now under arrest on an island prison, and Chaudhry is
asking members of the Commonwealth to pressure the government to
reinstate the constitution and restore democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He has visited New Zealand and Australia. After India, he will
travel to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Chaudhry was to meet in New Delhi with Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh. The Indian
government still regards him as Fiji's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   While Chaudhry was held hostage, Vajpayee met with Chaudhry's
relatives and appealed for Commonwealth pressure to free him. They
greeted him at the airport on his arrival Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry was welcomed to Haryana state by schoolchildren waving
flags, and he received an honorary doctorate from the Maharashi
Dayanand University.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm accepting this degree with pride and regret, regret that
this could not have happened in happier times for Fiji,'' Chaudhry
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chaudhry is fighting an arduous battle for restoring
democracy,'' Haryana's chief minister, Prakash Chautala, said at
the ceremony. ''We want him to know that we fully support him.''

<HEADLINE> Korea: U.S. Troops Killed Civilians  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean investigators, for the
first time, have determined that U.S. troops killed a large number
of refugees at the hamlet of No Gun Ri during the early days of the
Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   A one-page government report on the No Gun Ri probe, submitted
by South Korea's Defense Ministry to the National Assembly on June
22, said a list of at least 175 victims has been compiled based on
information provided by relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, the report said, ''have confirmed the existence
of the incident and the general outline of events that led to the
incident.''
</P>
<P>
   The summary said investigators would now try to determine the
exact motives of GIs in opening fire on the refugees, what chain of
command gave open-fire orders and ''where the responsibility
lies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a tragic calamity that took place during the early
days of...the Korean War,'' the ministry report said. The document,
part of a larger report on domestic issues, was distributed only to
lawmakers in June and later made public.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Pentagon and South Korea opened inquiries last year
after The Associated Press quoted U.S. veterans and South Korean
survivors as saying American GIs killed civilians sheltering under
the railroad viaduct at No Gun Ri on July 26-28, 1950. Ex-GIs spoke
of 100, 200 or simply hundreds dead. The South Koreans say up to
300 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry report said South Korean investigators have
reviewed and analyzed 690 crucial documents, traced the U.S.
military maneuvers at the time, and completed interviewing 140
survivors, relatives and villagers. The Pentagon, which is expected
to issue a report this fall, was interviewing 120 veterans, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report was the first official determination about the
killings at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the South Korean government rejected compensation
claims by survivors saying too much time had passed since the
incident. The government took no official position then regarding
the claims and did not launch any investigation at the time.
</P>
<P>
   AP also obtained an internal document that South Korean
investigators prepared for Defense Minister Cho Sung-tae in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is difficult to justify the indiscriminate shootings at the
noncombatants under the twin railroad underpasses,'' the document
said in a section entitled ''tentative assessments.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine-page document acknowledged that GIs needed to control
refugee throngs to clear the roads for retreating American troops
and prevent possible infiltration by enemy soldiers disguised as
refugees. But it accused the GIs of using ''excessive control'' of
refugees, regarding them as guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many months have passed since and new materials have become
available. The content of the document should never be considered
the ministry's official positions,'' Capt. Shin Han-woo, a
spokesman of Seoul's Defense Ministry, told The AP.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no intention to draw or publish tentative conclusions
before we reach our final decisions on what happened there 50 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the internal document, Korean investigators
believed their Pentagon counterparts were interested in finding out
whether South Korean police were at the scene at No Gun Ri. The
document said the police were evacuated days before the incident on
orders from the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean investigators also believed U.S. investigators were
trying to establish that the aerial attack was not intentional but
a mistake by pilots who mistook the refugee column for enemy
troops.
</P>
<P>
   In response, U.S. Army Spokesman Maj. Tom Collins told AP, ''we
are continuing to conduct a comprehensive review of the facts and
it is premature to discuss our findings until the review is
complete.''
</P>
<P>
   In late July, experts removed bullets and fragments from a
concrete wall of the railroad tunnel where refugees sheltered at No
Gun Ri. The Defense Ministry told survivors that 20 bullets were
taken out and examinations were still going on.

<HEADLINE> Rescue of Russian Sub Fails Again  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY RENFREW
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Underwater rescue capsules fighting to reach 118
seamen trapped on a Russian nuclear submarine failed again Thursday
as new evidence suggested a massive explosion shattered large areas
of the vessel and many sailors had no time to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials said there were no signs of life on the vessel,
but some of the crew could still be alive. Rescue capsules trying
to link up with the submarine for the past three days were again
driven back Thursday by racing currents and swirling sand in the
inky darkness on the sea bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said Thursday the situation was
''close to catastrophic,'' according to Russian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   A British rescue team heading for the scene by ship was not
expected to arrive until Saturday, raising fears it would be too
late. A Norwegian rescue team was expected to take even longer, not
reaching the scene until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The navy has given contradictory estimates of how long the
Kursk's oxygen could last, but some officers say air generators may
have been destroyed when the submarine slammed into the sea bed
last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Top navy and government officials met Thursday to review the
rescue effort and study new approaches, but officials gave no
details. The committee would consider how to use a British
mini-submarine being rushed to the scene, Russian news agencies
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Film of the submarine being studied Thursday showed massive
damage reaching from the front to the conning tower that would have
sent the vessel crashing to the bottom in seconds, navy officials
said. The control room where most of the crew work is below the
tower, suggesting many sailors had no time to escape when the
submarine went down.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accident happened so quickly we can say it was like a
flash,'' said navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. submarines monitoring Russian navy exercises when the Kursk
was lost detected two explosions at the time, according to U.S.
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian navy refused to confirm this, but officers have said
an explosion in the torpedo compartment at the front of the
submarine apparently caused the Kursk to sink. A likely scenario
was that one torpedo exploded, setting off a much bigger explosion
in the compartment which is packed with torpedoes.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk can carry up to 28 torpedoes and anti-submarine
missiles, each with warheads weighing up to 1,000 pounds. An
explosion involving even a few torpedoes would have caused
catastrophic damage, officers said.
</P>
<P>
   The damage apparently included the submarine's internal escape
capsule located in the conning tower, making it impossible to use,
Dygalo said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said authorities were still
investigating the possibility of a collision.
</P>
<P>
   After insisting for days that Western aid was not needed, the
Russian government asked Britain and Norway to for help. Two
Norwegian ships on Thursday were taking divers and the British
mini-submarine to the rescue area.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian turnabout apparently came after President Vladimir
Putin spoke with President Clinton on Wednesday and ordered his
Navy to seek help.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials refused to say Thursday why the British
mini-sub was not flown to a Russian airfield closer to the rescue
site. A Russian plane transported the mini-sub from Britain to
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   But British and Norwegian officials rejected suggestions that
Russia was not eager for Western help. Britain's Defense Ministry
said ''the Norway option provided the quickest and safest way of
getting our equipment to the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The navy Thursday raised the number aboard the Kursk to 118 from
116 without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue capsules are trying to latch onto one of the Kursk's
hatches. The effort was being frustrated by the strong currents and
almost zero visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Four Russian rescue capsules were taking turns to try to reach
the Kursk, each spending up to five hours submerged. The navy
angrily denied Russian press reports that the rescue crews were
failing because they were poorly trained.
</P>
<P>
   Success of the rescue operation is dependent not only on
latching on to a hatch but also on whether any survivors can open
it from inside. Submarine hatches can only be opened from the
inside to prevent intruders.

<HEADLINE> Sub Victims' Mothers Head for Base  </HEADLINE>
By MAXIM MARMUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   KURSK, Russia (AP) -- Anguished but holding onto hope, the
relatives of five sailors aboard the trapped nuclear submarine
named for this city set off Thursday for the base leading the
rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   As the train pulled out, other relatives ran alongside, blowing
kisses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just remembered when Dima left, it was just like this,''
Yuri Kuznetsov said, fighting back tears. ''He waved at me from the
train, a little nervous ... I told him it would be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to his nephew, 20-year-old Dmitry Staroseltsev,
whose mother Valentina was on the train, riding in a grimy
third-class car on a journey paid for by the local government.
</P>
<P>
   The offer from the local government brought some life back into
Dmitry's mother's face and gave her a reason to tear her eyes from
the television set that has been her lifeline since learning Monday
that the Kursk submarine had sunk to the floor of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm doing what I have to do,'' she said as she briskly packed
belongings for the daylong train ride from the city 285 miles south
of Moscow to the Arctic port of Murmansk.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that brings me closer to my son ...'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet chances that the journey will bring good news were slim.
Rescuers have been struggling for days to reach the submarine, and
have heard no sign of life inside.
</P>
<P>
   The ride ended a harrowing day for the families, who spent hours
seeking help from the Kursk regional administration for the trip.
The families could not afford train tickets and watched sadly all
week as television showed other sailors' relatives gathering to
share their grief in Murmansk. They were quartered on a boat that
will put to sea to greet the men if they are rescued.
</P>
<P>
   When Kursk officials announced in the afternoon that the trip
was on, Dmitry's mother was lifted out of her gloom, and she began
taking charge of the other parents, ordering some to bring sausage
for the train ride, others to bring beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Kuznetsova was not among those leaving Thursday to seek
news of her son, Mikhail. Hours after the submarine sank,
Kuznetsova left a Moscow hospital where she had undergone surgery
for breast cancer to return home to Kursk. She is still weak and
recuperating.
</P>
<P>
   But she joined the other families lobbying the administration
Thursday, out of a need to feel like she was doing something, to
take her mind off the sorrow, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many relatives of the 118 men on board the Kursk live in this
small industrial city. The stricken boat bears the city's name and
by tradition many of its crew are recruited from local high
schools. The navy has not released a list of sailors onboard, but
at least dozens are thought to come from Kursk.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Marks Quake Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By LOUIS MEIXLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLCUK, Turkey (AP) -- As a prayer leader chanted verses from
Muslim scripture, people in this town began to weep Thursday in
memory of the 17,000 people who died in Turkey a year ago in a
massive earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ''With God's mercy, we remember the martyrs,'' read a banner at
one of the many memorial services in the Golcuk area, one of the
hardest hit by the quake last Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   As memorial ceremonies progressed, a moderate earthquake shook
Kastamonu province, a reminder that most of northern Turkey sits on
an active fault line. There were no reports of injuries from that
quake, which had a preliminary magnitude of 4. Kastamonu is 375
miles east of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's magnitude 7.4 quake destroyed 285,000 buildings in
western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   In Golcuk, 70 miles east of Istanbul, about 800 people met in
the central square at 3:02 a.m. Thursday, clapping their hands,
honking car horns or blowing whistles to mark the moment when the
quake struck. The crowd then observed a moment of silence followed
by a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the crowd began weeping during readings from
Islam's holy book, the Quran. Similar gatherings were held in
cities throughout the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are here to remember,'' said Kemal Ozcan, a retired
shopowner.
</P>
<P>
   Ozcan was in his bedroom when the quake struck, bringing down
his ceiling and trapping him, his wife and his son beneath the
rubble. They spent almost four hours under the concrete before
neighbors dug them out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still can't escape the feelings of that night,'' Ozcan
said. ''We can't believe we are alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Shattered houses and factories still line the streets of Golcuk
and other towns. Golcuk's boardwalk slid into the sea during the
quake. The tops of street lamps and trees still poke through the
water a few feet off shore.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's government was severely criticized after the earthquake
for being slow and inefficient in dealing with the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   It is a charge that government officials took pains to address
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After a special Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
read a detailed list of state donations and accomplishments, down
to the number of electric heaters distributed to quake victims.
</P>
<P>
   In Adapazari, a town near Golcuk that was almost completely
destroyed during the quake, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer asked
residents to ''please be a little more patient.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We want you to trust in the state,'' he said. ''The problem we
have today is not what has been done, or the lack of it, but what
can be done better from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 26,000 quake survivors still live in tent cities while
another 150,000 live in prefabricated homes that are oppressively
hot in summer.
</P>
<P>
   The government has promised to build more than 20,000 permanent
homes by the end of the year and has said that most of the tent
cities will be closed before winter.
</P>
<P>
   Many quake survivors are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing has changed,'' said Metin Sagdic, who lost some 30
relatives in the quake. ''We see the same collapsed buildings one
year later.''
</P>
<P>
   The quake led to an outpouring of international sympathy for
Turkey. Dozens of countries sent aid, including the United States,
Israel, France, Germany and Greece, a traditional rival.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Greek aid workers rescuing Turks helped lead to a
thawing of relations between the countries. A month later, when an
earthquake shook Greece, Turkish rescue workers rushed to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''This momentum must be maintained and strengthened,'' Greek
Foreign Ministry spokesman Panagiotis Beglitis said in a statement
issued to mark Turkey's quake anniversary.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 60; Nasdaq Adds 76  </HEADLINE>
BC-Wall Street, 5th Ld-Writethru, f0146,0519
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher Thursday, as investors
sought out industries likely to escape an expected slowdown in
second-half corporate profits. Brokerages, oil producers and chip
makers led the gains.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 60.44 at 11,068.85.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 16.20 to 1,496.23, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 75.58 at 3,936.23.
</P>
<P>
   ''This market has been fairly lifeless recently. But if there's
been one theme -- and it's been hard to find one -- it's that
investors are concerned for earnings in the second half,'' said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've just gotten through the second-quarter earnings period
and the numbers were very strong. But the picture is not going to
be as pretty in the third and fourth quarters. So investors are
trying to find those industries and companies that won't be
affected by the slowdown in the growth of earnings,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson cited semiconductors, communications equipment, drug
companies, electric utilities and the oil sector as areas investors
believe may emerge relatively unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, shares of telecommunications parts maker Ciena
Corp. rose $15.25 to $178.375 on Thursday after the company
forecasted better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings based on
projected demand for fiber-optic parts.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement gave an across-the-board boost to Internet and
telecom equipment companies.
</P>
<P>
   The latest earnings scare came from Hewlett-Packard, however.
Two analysts expressed concern for the computer giant's second-half
profits, sending shares of the number two U.S. computer maker down
$12.75 to $107.375.
</P>
<P>
   A selloff in retail stocks dragged down the Dow index on
Wednesday as investors fretted that second-half profits could fall
short of expectations if consumer spending eases in step with the
Federal Reserve Board's policy of cooling the economy to fight
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economic data released recently has signaled that the Fed's
strategy to slow the economy may be working.
</P>
<P>
   However, while a slowing economy may prevent the Fed from
raising interest rates, it also raises the specter of lower
second-half profits.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts consider the Fed's policy of cooling the economy
through higher interest rates a double-edged sword and are hoping
for a ''soft landing,'' meaning economic growth eases but not so
much that it hurts companies' bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good news is that the Fed probably won't raise interest
rates,'' Johnson observed. ''But the bad news is that the rate of
earnings will slow and that's what investors are focusing on.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 649.54 million shares, down
from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 0.90 to 513.76.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Voice in Israeli Arms  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is working with Israel on
arrangements that would assure U.S. consultation before Israel
sells arms to other countries, a senior U.S. official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to avoid the kind of public dispute that marked a
planned Israeli sale of an advanced airborne radar system to China.
Under U.S. pressure, Prime Minister Ehud Barak called off the
lucrative deal during summit talks last month at Camp David, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation cost Israel about $500 million and an
opportunity to strengthen ties with the world's most-populous
nation. Meanwhile, Chinese President Jiang Zemin complained to
Defense Secretary William Cohen about the cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   No U.S. technology was involved. But the Clinton administration
leaned on Israel anyhow, apparently because of concern the Phalcon
system could have improved China's capability to carry out air
strikes against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the United States does not claim veto powers over Israel's weapons
sales that do not involve U.S. equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the administration wants a better system of
consultation before a sale is concluded. That would give the United
States a chance to raise objections in private.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by army radio Thursday in Israel, the
United States has decided to reduce sharply -- from 27 to four -- the
number of countries to which Israeli arms sales would be reviewed
by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The four, according to the report, are China, Russia, India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The official called the report premature.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, Danny Yatom, who is Barak's political
and security adviser, confirmed that Israel and the United States
had held a series of discussions on the arms issue in recent weeks
and have made progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can confirm that the positions between us and the Americans
are not as far apart as they used to be,'' Yatom told army radio.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Statehood If Conflict Ends  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel would agree to creation of a Palestinian
state if the Palestinians end their conflict with Israel, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday in his clearest reference yet to
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after U.S. State Department mediator Dennis Ross
arrived to evaluate whether the two sides are ready to move toward
a peace accord despite the failure of last month's summit at Camp
David, Barak warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to declare
a state unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians want to set up a state in the West Bank and
Gaza, with the traditionally Arab section of Jerusalem as its
capital. Israel claims all of Jerusalem and wants to keep small
parts of the West Bank where most Jewish settlers live.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning borders or Jerusalem, Barak said he would
agree to a state, an issue he has been ambiguous about in public
until now.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Palestinian leadership is prepared to confront the
challenge of setting up a Palestinian state and solving the
hardships of its people,'' said Barak, ''it must understand that a
condition for that is ending the conflict with Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's opponents charge he is offering the Palestinians broad
concessions without demanding that they formally end the
century-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
   When they signed an interim agreement last September, the two
sides set a target date of Sept. 13 for finishing a peace treaty.
Arafat said that after that date, he would have the right to
declare an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a military college graduation ceremony, Barak warned
that a unilateral declaration would provoke Israeli countermeasures
and violence. ''This kind of deterioration would hurt, first and
foremost, the Palestinians themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did not specify the countermeasures, but Israeli officials
have mentioned annexing parts of the West Bank, blocking entry of
Palestinian workers and stopping trade, effectively choking the
Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting Ross, acting Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami said the question of another summit is not on the agenda
now. ''We need to have some flexibility from the other side,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said his mission is to see ''whether or not the differences
that exist can be overcome.'' Ross is to meet with Barak, but
Arafat is abroad and is not expected back until next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli military expressed regret Thursday over the shooting
death of an elderly Palestinian after he fired on Israeli soldiers
Wednesday near Ramallah on the West Bank. He apparently thought
they were burglars, and the soldiers thought they were under
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's security chief, Col. Jibril Rajoub, charged that the
shooting was a crime that would hurt the peace process. ''I think
it was a plot by the Israelis, who went in the dark of night, like
thieves,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians agreed on one issue Thursday --
rejecting a State Department travel advisory warning American
tourists that there is an ''increased possibility of terror
attacks'' in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Yatom, an adviser to Barak, said the announcement was
unnecessary. Rajoub called it ''State Department propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said his
forces are always on alert for terror attacks, but there are no
specific warnings now.

<HEADLINE> New law requires inspection and licensing of pet dealers  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A new law will require pet stores and
breeders in New York to be licensed.
</P>
<P>
   The law signed by Gov. George Pataki requires ''pet dealers'' to
maintain records on the origins and medical history of dogs and
cats and provide the information to buyers. Dealers also must
comply with statewide minimum standards of animal care, such as
providing appropriate housing, food and veterinary care.
</P>
<P>
   Pet stores and breeders will have apply for licenses, renewable
annually, from the state Department of Agriculture and Markets.
</P>
<P>
   The department will also inspect facilities at least once a
year. Violations may lead to fines from $50 to $1,000, or
suspension or revocation of licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say the new law targets ''backyard breeders,'' some of
whom currently don't keep records or aren't providing adequate
care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just paying a fee, getting a form and a license to
operate. You need to meet those thresholds in order to operate,''
said Lisa Weisberg, vice president of government affairs at the
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA).
</P>
<P>
   ''There should be no reason why consumers who purchase a pet
from a local shop should have to question the health of the animals
they buy,'' said Assemblyman Scott Stringer, a Manhattan Democrat
and bill sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The law applies only to the care of cats and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, pet dealers have to bring animals to a licensed
veterinarian within five business days of sale for a complete
checkup. Animals 18 months old or older will also have to be
checked for congenital diseases, and dealers will have to inform
customers of any such problems in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Proper vaccination and other health records are also required.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the state's ''pet lemon law'' went into effect,
requiring pet dealers to guarantee the good health of any animal
they sell. Customers who purchase sick animals have 14 days to seek
refunds or exchanges. The law also requires the stores to reimburse
owners for medical bills up to the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Another ''implied warranty and merchantability'' law has also
been applied to pets and entitles pet owners to reimbursement
within two years of purchase, Weisberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of the pet dealer licensing law will ensure that
animals, as well as consumers, are protected, she said.

<HEADLINE> Judge dismisses charges filed against concrete attack suspect  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan judge on Thursday threw out an
attempted murder charge against a man who confessed to bashing a
young woman's head with a five-pound chunk of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Court Judge Donna Recant dismissed the charge at the
request of Assistant District Attorney Amy Schwartz, who said an
investigation by her office revealed that Bentley Louis Grant, 35,
is not the assailant.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's investigation uncovered a surveillance
videotape showing Grant in a Virgin Records store on July 9 at the
time Tiffany Goldberg, 25, of Madison, Wis., was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who was apparently homeless at the time, was picked up
July 19 and charged in the attack. Goldberg, who had just left
Marble Collegiate Church on Park Avenue at 29th Street where she
sings in the choir, suffered a cracked skull, broken teeth, a black
eye and cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz balked at a request by Grant's lawyer, Natasha
Lapiner-Giresi, for the videotape. The prosecutor said Grant is not
entitled to the tape because no charges are pending against him,
and the case is over.
</P>
<P>
   Lapiner-Giresi did not say why she wanted the tape, but Grant's
civil attorney, Patrick Joyce, said he plans to file a lawsuit
against the city on Grant's behalf within the next 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce, who could try to bolster the civil case with the tape,
said he believes the police settled on Grant as a suspect and
stopped looking for anyone else. He said the assailant evidently
''is still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapiner-Giresi said outside court that the charges should have
been dropped on July 24 when Schwartz came to court and said
evidence showed police had arrested the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the apparent mistake, Grant is not bitter,
Lapiner-Giresi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we walked out of the courtroom he said to me, 'I hope that
woman goes on with her singing career, and I hope she does well,'''
the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she didn't know why Grant confessed or why three
witnesses identified him as the assailant.
</P>
<P>
   He now has a place to live and is doing ''fine,'' Lapiner-Giresi
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not going to the hospital. He has an apartment, and he
intends to continue living his life.''

<HEADLINE> Builders join chorus of protest over DEP's sewer proposal  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Department of Environmental
Protection's proposal for new regulations on sewers and water
quality isn't making anyone happy.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Builders Association, which represents most of
the state's housing developers, has denounced the DEP's proposed
sewer rules as too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference with developers Wednesday, association officials
issued a position paper claiming regulations that link the impact
of new housing to area water quality will limit builders in areas
where there is plenty of sewer capacity to build new homes,
according to spokeswoman Roberta Wells.
</P>
<P>
   The association paper said this change in rules will reduce the
construction of affordable homes in the next two decades when tens
of thousands of families will be seeking them. ''It will inflate
costs statewide, reducing the housing and employment opportunities
of middle and modest income families,'' the association's paper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, environmental groups have been attacking the DEP's
proposed rules as too weak in limiting sprawl by exempting some
sewerage authorities from seeking new permits to expand their
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   DEP spokesman Peter Page said, ''There has been the most
hyperbolic rhetoric from the environmentalists, and now from the
builders.''
</P>
<P>
   Page said all the state is trying to do is make sure new
development does not damage area water quality. That is not only a
question of sewage treatment but also of how surface runoff from
new streets, roofs and driveways influences a ''watershed,'' which
is the region feeding rain runoff into a lake or stream.
</P>
<P>
   Page acknowledged the change in strategy embedded in these rules
is substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rule is a major shift in how we are going to oversee land
use in New Jersey because we are making the direct connection
between water quality and development,'' Page said. ''Simple
reality now is that when you put development into an area that is
undeveloped, you degrade water quality.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have every confidence that developers are going to be able
to build with creativity and technology that is going to be
friendlier to the hydrological cycle,'' Page said, referring to the
life cycle of how waterways and groundwater systems flow and are
recharged.
</P>
<P>
   But the builders association in its position paper said the DEP
is avoiding the full picture. ''Regulating future development is
only one piece of a true water quality strategy. Given New Jersey's
historic development patterns, significant progress in improving
the state's water quality is possible only by addressing existing
causes of pollution, including outdated technologies'' in sewer
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Page said all the complaints about the proposed rules will be
taken into account. They will be reviewed starting Oct. 9 and
subject to change, at which point they will be published publicly
again before taking effect.

	   MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) - Lucent Technologies said Thursday that
it has received a contract worth up to $200 million from Sprint
Corp. to expand the telecommunications carrier's Internet network.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will help Sprint keep pace with its soaring demand
for Internet access and enhanced Internet services such as virtual
private networks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Lucent will supply its APX 8000
Multiservice Access Switch, NavisAccess network management software
and NetworkCare professional services, which includes program
management, installation and testing. Sprint will use Lucent's
Softswitch Internet Call Diversion solution to route data traffic
away from its voice network to prevent congestion and provide
customers with faster and easier access to the Internet, Lucent
said.

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The Prudential Insurance Co. of America said
Thursday that it has agreed to acquire a majority stake in one of
Taiwan's largest asset-management companies for about $95 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential said it would obtain at least 80 percent of
MasterLink Securities Investment Trust Enterprise's outstanding
stock, under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1992, MasterLink has nearly $1.6 billion in assets.
It offers 13 mutual funds, including eight domestic equity, three
overseas equity and two domestic bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''MasterLink fits into Prudential's preferred profile for
international asset management acquisitions. This company has a
large, retail-oriented customer base in Taiwan and a high
percentage of regular monthly savings accounts that bring strength
and stability to the company's assets under management,'' said
Douglas Fergusson, president of Prudential Asia.

<P>
   LIVINGSTON, N.J. (AP) - Continental Choice Care Inc. announced
Thursday that it has changed its name to TechSys Inc. It will begin
trading on the Nasdaq small cap market as early as next week under
its new symbol, TKSS.
</P>
<P>
   The new name reflects the former dialysis company's new focus on
investing in and acquiring information technology businesses.
TechSys said it will focus on business in emerging markets such as
India.
</P>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Department of Community Affairs
announced Thursday that it is providing more than $200,000 in
grants for job training for urban women.
</P>
<P>
   The funding is being channeled through the state's Job Training
Center for Urban Women. The program provides grants to nonprofit
agencies and educational institutions for the implementation of job
training programs and other services to assist unemployed and
underemployed urban women.
</P>
<P>
   The program awarded $110,000 to the Camden County Council on
Economic Opportunity, $85,000 to the New Jersey State
Federation/Colored Women Clubs Inc. in Trenton and $35,000 to Essex
County College.

   EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - The Regional Consortium, a group of
five transportation agencies committed to bringing E-ZPass to
Northeastern highways, said Thursday that more than 500,000 E-ZPass
tags have been issued since the electronic toll system was
introduced on the Atlantic City Expressway and Interstate 95 in
Delaware in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that we have issued over one-half million
transponders in just 20 months of operation proves that the
motorists appreciate and value the hassle-free, more convenient
commute provided by E-ZPass,'' said Edward Gross, executive
director of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the lead agency of
the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   E-ZPass should be installed at interchanges along the turnpike
on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden State Parkway first opened E-ZPass lanes on the
Parkway last December. Each toll plaza along the 173-mile stretch
will be equipped with E-ZPass by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   The Parkway's New Gretna toll plaza opened its first E-ZPass
lane Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Disco OK'd Near Former Death Camp  </HEADLINE>
By BEATA PASEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- An investor has obtained permission to
operate a discotheque in a former tannery where Auschwitz inmates
worked and died, an official said Thursday, and a TV report said it
was already open for business.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have such a law that once an investor fulfills formal
requirements, he will get permission,'' said Adam Bilski, the
administrator for Oswiecim, the Polish name for the city of
Auschwitz. ''One can consider whether it is moral or not, but
that's another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The discotheque, in the southern city of Oswiecim where the Nazi
camp was located during the German occupation in World War II, has
been in operation for a week, according to a public Channel One TV
news report.
</P>
<P>
   The former tannery is just over a mile from the Auschwitz camp.
The camp, where 1.5 million died in the gas chambers or from
disease and starvation, is now a museum.
</P>
<P>
   From 1942 to 1945, about 1,000 prisoners worked in the former
tannery where many of them died. Museum historians say the building
was also used to store property and hair of Jewish victims of the
gas chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an entertainment company, Art-Mix, received
permission to open a disco in the former tannery.
</P>
<P>
   A provincial governor revoked the permission after protests from
the leaders of a nearby Polish-German center for international
youth dialogue who said the disco would disturb visitors and
disrupt its mission of reconciliation and understanding between
Poles and Germans.
</P>
<P>
   But now a new investor, represented by Zdzislaw Bieniek, has
been granted permission for the disco, said Bilski, the city
adminstrator. The name of the new investor has not been made
public.
</P>
<P>
   A development plan approved by the city council in 1989 says the
former tannery can be used for various purposes, said Bilski. In
the mid-1990s dining and entertainment were allowed for the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials have withheld comment on the planned disco, but
the provincial governor could step in again to stop the project.
</P>
<P>
   Leszek Szuster of the youth center told Channel One TV that the
noise from the music disturbs the operation of the center.
</P>
<P>
   In early August, the interior minister overruled a ban by local
authorities on a project to build a commercial visitors center near
Auschwitz, which Jewish leaders say would violate an agreement
establishing a non-commercial zone around the notorious camp.
</P>
<P>
   The developer plans to build a center with a bookstore, a
self-service restaurant and a post office for the estimated 500,000
people who visit Auschwitz annually.

<HEADLINE> Work Injury Deaths Down Last Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There were 6,023 Americans who died from
injuries at work last year, 32 fewer than in 1998 despite an
increase in employment, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 figure -- about 17 fatal injuries each day -- was the
lowest since the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics started
keeping track in 1992. The unemployment rate for U.S. civilian
workers declined from 4.5 percent in 1998 to 4.2 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There were 6,055 job-related deaths in 1998 and 6,238 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest report, declines in job-related murders and deaths
from electrocution were offset by increases in workers struck by
falling objects or caught in running machinery.
</P>
<P>
   The construction industry reported the largest number of fatal
work injuries, 341.
</P>
<P>
   The report ''shows that we must do more to prevent workplace
fatalities in the construction industry, just as we have reduced
homicides in the workplace, especially in retail establishments,''
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said in a statement. ''No workers
should have to sacrifice their lives for their livelihoods.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of people murdered at work fell to 645 last year from
714 in 1998 and 860 in 1997. That bumped homicide from the
second-leading cause of workplace deaths to the third, behind
highway crashes involving truck drivers and workers struck by
vehicles, and work-related falls.
</P>
<P>
   Most workplace homicides are related to robberies. Herman noted
that the Labor Department had provided violence-prevention guidance
to taxi companies and retailers.

<HEADLINE> Bill and Chelsea Clinton register to vote in NY  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - As Al Gore nudged his boss away from
the political center stage, President Clinton moved a step closer
to his post-White House life, changing his voter registration from
Arkansas to Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   The county Board of Elections added Clinton and daughter
Chelsea, 20, to the voter rolls Wednesday, a week after receiving
their registration forms, Commissioner of Elections Reginald
Lafayette said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president looks forward to exercising his right to vote in
the great state of New York,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert
said. ''He thinks he'll have some good candidates on the ballot
this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Westchester residents will next go to the voting booths for the
state's Sept. 12 primary, when a little-known New York City
orthopedic surgeon, Mark McMahon, challenges Hillary Rodham Clinton
for the Democratic Senate nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, who is expected to face Republican Rep. Rick
Lazio in the general election, registered to vote in Westchester
County in December, shortly after the Clintons bought a $1.7
million wood-frame house in Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Chelsea Clinton listed the Chappaqua home as their new
address, according to Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased to have him as a voter,'' the elections
commissioner said. ''I'm sure that he's going to volunteer to work
at the polls. ... I think he'll help me out after Jan. 20.''
</P>
<P>
   The president signed his registration form on Aug. 4 and Chelsea
signed hers on Aug. 1. The Board of Elections received the forms
Aug. 9, Lafayette said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's good for the county of Westchester to have the
president live here,'' Lafayette said.

<HEADLINE> Popular CBS 'Survivor' Draws Fans  </HEADLINE>
By SONJA BARISIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- He's the resident grump, the one who
doesn't make friends and doesn't show emotion. But as Rudy Boesch
gets closer to winning the $1 million on ''Survivor,'' the
excitement's spilling over in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   At ''Survivor'' parties and local watering holes, southeastern
Virginia is rooting for the curmudgeonly retired Navy SEAL, one of
four contestants still in the running to win $1 million in next
Wednesday's finale.
</P>
<P>
   The region was the nation's No. 1 market for the show Wednesday,
with about 30 percent of area households tuned to ''Survivor,'' a
CBS spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   At Jillian's bar and restaurant in Norfolk, home of the world's
largest Navy base, several hundred patrons gather each week to
watch the show and their 72-year-old hero.
</P>
<P>
   ''When his face comes on the screen, everyone screams, 'Rudy!'''
said Brian Radford, Jillian's manager. ''It's pretty insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Beach Mayor Meyera Oberndorf is preparing to proclaim a
''Rudy Boesch Day.''
</P>
<P>
   As pretty much everybody knows by now, Boesch was one of 16
people ''marooned'' on a Malaysian island. Every three days, the
contestants voted someone off the island, with the last survivor to
win the jackpot after 39 days.
</P>
<P>
   Boesch did not answer telephone calls to his home seeking
comment. The show was taped this spring, and CBS has forbidden
contestants to give away the ending.
</P>
<P>
   On the island, Boesch seemed to sense that at least his old Navy
buddies would be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the whole Atlantic Fleet is wondering what that son of
a ... is doing out there,'' he said during this week's show.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy enlisted man for 45 years, Boesch was one of the original
50 Navy SEAL Team 2 members in 1962. He completed two combat
deployments to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He works out daily and enjoys fishing. In July, he had the catch
of the day in a local tournament: a 115-pound bluefin tuna. He and
his wife of 42 years, Marge, also volunteer with the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   On ''Survivor,'' Boesch has earned a reputation for bluntness.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only reason I'd bring a Bible out here is if I needed
toilet paper,'' he said when another contestant brought a Bible as
his one ''luxury'' item. Boesch's luxury item was more practical: a
toothbrush.
</P>
<P>
   People leaving messages at the www.survivorsucks.com Web site
seem to either love Boesch or hate him. One posting calls him
''everyone's favorite cranky old guy''; another a ''silly, silly
old man.''
</P>
<P>
   Erasmo Riojas, who has a Web site devoted to his former SEAL
teammate, said Boesch is ''a buddy with everyone'' but definitely
outspoken. He recalled the crewcut Boesch telling fellow sailors,
''You need a haircut.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Rudy will never change,'' said Riojas, of Pearland, Texas.
''Rudy is Rudy.''

	   Skakel, now 39, is the son of Rushton Skakel Sr., a brother of
slain U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel. The Skakels lived
across the street from the Moxleys in Belle Haven, an exclusive
gated community in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   For years, authorities suspected Skakel's older brother, Thomas,
then 17, in Moxley's killing. But no arrests were ever made, and
the case stalled until a grand jury consisting of a single judge
was appointed in 1998. In January, Michael Skakel was arrested
based on the grand juror's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's bludgeoned body was found on her family's estate on
Oct. 31, 1975. She had been with the Skakel brothers and other
teen-age friends the night before, when authorities believe she was
murdered as she left the Skakel house to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict has said Skakel should be tried as an adult because
''no Connecticut juvenile institution has the ability to deal in
any way with a 39- or 40-year-old man.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted as an adult, Skakel faces a possible life sentence.

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Lewis Fined $250,000 by NFL  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ray Lewis was fined $250,000 by the NFL Thursday
for obstructing an Atlanta police investigation of a double murder
after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The fine is believed to be the largest ever levied by the NFL
against a player other than in cases involving substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, commissioner Paul Tagliabue ruled that Lewis will
be fined an another $250,000 and be subject to suspension if he
violates any of the terms of his 12-month probation for a guilty
plea to a misdemeanor charge of obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the Baltimore Ravens' All-Pro middle linebacker, was
originally accused with two others of murder in the stabbing deaths
of two men following a post-Super Bowl party last January. He
interrupted the trial to plead guilty to the misdemeanor and agreed
to testify against his co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The two co-defendants were subsequently acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue noted in levying the fine that Lewis' reputation had
suffered and he had paid substantial legal fees
</P>
<P>
   But the commissioner said that by not telling police the full
story, Lewis ''fueled a public perception that he had something to
hide.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In doing so,'' Tagliabue added, ''he put his own livelihood
and reputation needlessly at risk and he caused great harm to other
NFL players and to the league.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed and I will appeal,'' Lewis said in a
statement released by the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, Ravens spokesman Kevin Byrne said, ''We have
supported Ray since the beginning of this situation and will
continue to support him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' arrest was one of several that has tarnished the NFL's
reputation in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rae Carruth, the former Carolina Panthers' wide receiver, has
been charged in the fatal shooting of the mother of his child. He
is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Another former Panther, Fred Lane, was shot to death last spring
in what the police said was a domestic dispute. No arrests have
been made.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said all the cases have harmed the NFL and its
players.
</P>
<P>
   ''When an NFL player engages in and admits to misconduct of the
type to which Mr. Lewis has pled here, the biggest losers are
thousands of other NFL players, present, past and future,'' he said
''Such admitted misconduct clearly contributes to the negative
stereotyping of NFL players.''
</P>
<P>
   The league said the only larger fines would have involved cases
where players were docked four game checks for violating the NFL's
substance-abuse policy but were not suspended. None of players in
those cases have been publicly identified, the NFL said.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- For once, Jack Nicklaus didn't want to be
on a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   For once, it looked like he didn't belong.
</P>
<P>
   With the death of his mother weighing heavily on his slumped

seemed a weary figure Thursday as he trudged around steamy Valhalla
Golf Club.
</P>

   It didn't help that he shot a 5-over 77 and likely won't make

   ''I felt sort of inadequate out there today,'' Nicklaus said.
</P>
<P>
   A day after his mother died at the age of 90, Nicklaus honored
one of her last wishes by playing in the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Nicklaus had feared her death would interfere with her
son's plans to play all four major championships for the last time
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no desire to be here, I promise you,'' Nicklaus said.
''But I felt that this is what she would have wanted me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus was paired for the first time with Woods, in a symbolic
changing of the guard featuring the player many consider the best
golfer ever and the one most consider will become the greatest
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember, bears eat tigers,'' Nicklaus' wife, Barbara
whispered in his ear as he went to the first tee.
</P>
<P>
   Not at the age of 60, they don't. And not when the Tiger next to
him was shooting an effortless 66.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a day when Nicklaus was going to kid himself about
his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ''He plays a game which I am not familiar with,'' Nicklaus said,
borrowing the line Bobby Jones said when he saw Nicklaus play as a
young man. ''Of course, I played a game today I was not familiar
with, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The large crowd following the featured group, which also
included Masters champion Vijay Singh, barely had a chance to cheer
their favorites off the first tee, and Nicklaus was already 2 over,
thanks to a double bogey from left of the green, on the first hole.
</P>
<P>
   He was 4 over after five holes, before a beautiful up-and-down
from deep weeds beneath the sixth green seemed to help settle him
down. The day suddenly seemed to brighten for Nicklaus, and he
promptly made his only birdie of the day on the next hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a hard time getting focused to start with,'' Nicklaus
said. ''I wish I had played better, but I tried as hard as I
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods saw what was going on, and understood.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could tell he wasn't really into the round,'' Woods said.
''But once he got into the rhythm of playing, you can tell his mind
started getting more and more sharp and started concentrating more
on each and every shot. Once he got more into it, he started
playing better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus had played with Woods in a practice round before the
Masters a few years ago, but never in competition. He got a chance
to see up close what all the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   In his prime, it was Nicklaus hitting it past all the
competition. On Thursday, Nicklaus outdrove Woods only when he hit
driver to Woods' 2-iron -- and then only by 10 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to play with Tiger before I retired from the game,''
Nicklaus said. ''I haven't seen anyone else play this well. His 66
was just a piece of cake. It could have easily been a 60.''
</P>
<P>
   The pairing reminded Nicklaus of the time he played with Gene
Sarazen in 1971 at the PGA Championship, when Sarazen's playing
days were basically over.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a real privilege for me to play with him and it was
fun,'' Nicklaus recalled. ''I am sure he had the opportunity to get
to watch me in the prime of my career at the same time. And I am
getting the opportunity to watch Tiger in the prime of his career.
It was something I have wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans lining the fairways of Valhalla shared in that
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching each green, usually with Woods in front, the cheers
rose for each player, with the loudest reserved for the aging
champion of 18 major tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you, Jack. Thank you,'' one fan shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ''God bless your mama,'' another called out from behind the 18th
green.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Nicklaus seemed almost energized by the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's my last major championship or not, I had a unique
experience and enjoyed it very much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus then prepared for a quick flight to Columbus, Ohio, to
be with family members preparing for his mother's funeral service
on Monday. He planned to be back for one final major championship
round on Friday, playing with Woods and Singh in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The day started tough, but now Nicklaus was actually looking
forward to Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully I can shoot a little better score tomorrow,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Knoblauch's Elbow Improves  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Chuck Knoblauch's sore right elbow is showing
signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's getting better,'' the New York Yankees second baseman
said Thursday after working out at the team's development center.
''I've thrown some and haven't had any bad reactions. It's going
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's right elbow has bothered him for the past month.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI in early August confirmed an earlier diagnosis that
Knoblauch has tendinitis and inflammation in the elbow. He is
eligible to come off the 15-day disabled list Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how many more days,'' Knoblauch said. ''That's a
little bit up to me, but it's up to these guys to give me the go
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who said he will be back this season, fielded
grounders, took batting practice and had a throwing session.
</P>
<P>
   He injured the elbow July 24 at Baltimore and went on the DL for
the first time in his 10-year major league career.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch is hitting .291 with 60 runs scored this season. He
has 15 errors, most on throws.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The unseasonable rain is not likely to let
up, matching areas with the most summer rainfall in the continental
United States, according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   If it continues as predicted, New York's summer precipitation
will be akin to Miami, which has some of the wettest summers in the
country. New York's August rainfall so far is about five times the
August average in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, New York has received about 15 inches of rain; the
average is 10 inches. The August average of 4 inches has already
been surpassed and it's expected to keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the forecast Ken and Karen Jones of Huguenot wanted
to hear. The water in their Hudson Valley driveway is a foot deep
and fills the area from the street to their garage door.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say it's at least 50 feet wide,'' said Deerpark Town
Supervisor James Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the nightmare story of the guy who bought some land and
it turns out to be a swamp,'' Ken Jones told the Middletown Times
Herald-Record.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said roads and driveways have been washed out because
there has been too much rain for the water to soak into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has torn out a great big drain on one of our town roads,''
Chandler said, adding that the pipe, about 6 feet in diameter,
ripped out the road.
</P>
<P>
   Massive driveway puddles are common this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been there all summer,'' Margaret Hart said, describing
the puddle as about 6 feet long. ''It's quite a bit of water.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing you can do about it,'' said Christine Kronau,
Hart's mother. ''I was golfing last night and you could see huge
ravines where the water had come down hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri Goetz said her tractor sank when she and her husband tried
to tend to their acre and a half in Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pond overflowed, the pool overflowed,'' Goetz said. ''We
had to pump the extra water out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a picnic table at ''On the Farm,'' an outdoor eatery
in a suburb of Albany, Vicki Francese chatted with her co-workers
on a lunch break from Concord Pools.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of angry customers,'' Francese said of the
company that sells and installs pools. ''Only because there is so
much groundwater, we can't get a lot of work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Person, who took orders from behind the counter, said the
food stand, usually ''jam-packed'' in the summer, was slow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who wants to stand in the rain and get ice cream?'' Person
asked.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina, a massive body of cool water in the Pacific, might be
partly responsible for the excessive rain, said Bob Chartuk of the
National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Also affecting the precipitation Chartuk called ''considerably
above average'' is the jet-stream that pushed summer showers
northward, almost doubling precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   Although temperatures rounded out to about average, most of New
York has not seen a high temperature above 85 degrees since June.

<HEADLINE> Sabonis Reportedly To Miss Olympics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) -- Portland Trail Blazers center Arvydas
Sabonis won't play for Lithuania in the Olympics because he is
still recovering from major foot surgery, local media reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot-3 Sabonis helped his country to bronze medals in the
last two Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the 35-year-old center dampens the team's hope of
adding another medal at the Sydney Games. Lithuania will also play
without injured Cleveland Cavaliers center Zydrunas Ilgauskas.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis, who has been plagued by foot injuries for much of his
career, consulted Trail Blazers trainer Jay Jensen before making a
final decision about skipping the Olympics, the Lytuvos Rytas daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
   His swollen foot shouldn't threaten the resumption of his career
in the NBA later this year, the daily said.

<HEADLINE> Cavs' Knight Has Knee Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Brevin Knight
had right knee surgery Thursday and is expected to be out up to
four months.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's knee has bothered him for about a month and he had a
bone fragment removed from his kneecap.
</P>
<P>
   ''We anticipate a full recovery and look forward to his return
to the Cavs' lineup,'' general manager Jim Paxson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brevin has been a very consistent performer in his first three
years with the Cavs.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight averaged 9.3 points and seven assists in 65 games last
season, including 46 starts.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken by Cleveland out of Stanford with the 16th pick in
the first round of the 1997 NBA draft. He became the team's
starting point guard as a rookie, earning a spot on the league's
All-Rookie team.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of last season, the 5-foot-10 Knight became a
backup to rookie Andre Miller. Knight missed 14 of the 15 games
between Feb. 5 and March 10 with a right quadriceps tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers signed 10-year guard Bimbo Coles to a contract
Saturday. He also can play the point guard spot.

<HEADLINE> Arbitrator To Hear Beltran Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The players' association filed a default notice
against the Kansas City Royals for failing to give reigning AL
Rookie of the Year Carlos Beltran a full paycheck, and the
grievance was scheduled to be heard starting Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the union and the commissioner's office agreed to
the date Thursday. Shyam Das, baseball's independent arbitrator,
will hear arguments Aug. 23-24 in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The union filed a grievance last Friday, a day after Beltran was
suspended without pay for refusing to report to Royals' Florida
training complex for rehabilitation. The team said the suspension
would last for 30 days or until he reports, whichever is shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran makes $350,000 this season, and each day of the
suspension would cost him $1,923. The Royals have said they
anticipated the default notice would be filed and said they then
would pay Beltran, so as not to risk him becoming a free agent if
the arbitrator ruled in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City said it has the right to decide Beltran's medical
treatment, citing a provision in each player's contract. The union,
citing provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, said he
can't be sent to the minor leagues for rehabilitation without his
consent.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran, 23, has been on the disabled list with a bruised right
knee since July 5. The Royals have set a team policy that players
on the DL should rehabilitate at Haines City, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Senators' Bonk Wins Arbitration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Ottawa Senators forward Radek Bonk got a big
raise Thursday as NHL arbitration hearings wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   The center was awarded a two-year deal worth $3.25 million. He
will make $1.5 million in 2000-2001, a hefty raise over his salary
last season of $800,000, and $1.75 million the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Bonk had 23 goals and 37 assists in 80 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   In other decisions, Dallas Stars right winger Blake Sloan was
awarded a one-year contract worth $550,000, an increase over last
year's $375,000.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two players filed for arbitration in 2000, and 18 of them
settled with their respective teams before going to a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary Flames goaltender Fred Brathwaite was the biggest
winner, going from a salary of $373,400 to $950,000, an increase of
156 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Capitals defenseman Brendan Witt saw the smallest
gain. He will stay at the same $1 million for 2000-2001 and will
get a $75,000 increase the following year.

<HEADLINE> UConn's Auriemma Gets $2.95M Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- The University of Connecticut is rewarding
women's basketball coach Geno Auriemma with a new five-year, $2.95
million contract four months after he led the Huskies to their
second national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma, who has coached the team for the past 15 years, will
be paid $590,000 annually, which is $307,000 more than under the
old contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''Geno has personally directed the building of a great college
basketball program which has brought positive national recognition
to our entire university,'' UConn athletic director Lew Perkins
said Thursday in a prepared statement. ''This new agreement
recognizes coach Auriemma as the nation's top women's basketball
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract is retroactive to Aug. 11 and runs through April
14, 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The annual compensation includes a base salary of $164,000 and
another $426,000 for speaking fees and media appearances.
</P>
<P>
   UConn athletic officials say no taxpayer dollars are used to pay
Auriemma. The money comes from Athletic Department revenue sources
such as gate receipts, private fund-raising, corporate
partnerships, television and radio rights fees and money from the
Big East Conference and the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   UConn men's coach Jim Calhoun will make $879,984 this year. He
signed a five-year contract last year after his team won the NCAA
title.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun also has a base salary of $164,000 a year, but his
speaking fees and media appearance money come to $715,749 annually.

<HEADLINE> Union files complaint against job agency  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - An agency that helps people find jobs is
being accused of unlawfully firing two employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Federation of Educational and Professional
Employees accused Global Associates of dismissing two employees of
Connecticut Job Corps because they were trying to organize a union.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints with the National Labor Relations Board in
Hartford seek to reinstate the employees with back pay and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Global Associates, a government contractor based in Irvine,
Calif., denied the allegation but declined to discuss why the
employees were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Belton-White, who was a counselor and taught high school
diploma equivalency classes, said she was discharged two days after
a manager at Connecticut Job Corps asked her about her union
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I began to assist in organizing, I was immediately
dismissed,'' she said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Belton-White said managers told her she was fired for bringing a
Bible to class and for failing to follow counseling procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hodel, who had been a social worker and counselor at the
job center for more than 4 years, said he also was fired after
trying to organize a union.
</P>
<P>
   Hodel said he was told he was dismissed for failing to turn in
the proper paperwork. He is legally blind and uses a wheelchair,
and alleged managers did not give him the assistance he needed or
the correct paperwork to fill out.
</P>
<P>
   Global Associates did not even know the employees were trying to
form a union, said Tina Cato, vice president of program
development.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't discuss why they were terminated, but I can tell you
they were not terminated for union activity,'' Cato said.
</P>
<P>
   The frequent turnover of counselors and teachers is harming the
students who come to the center to get their high school
equivalency diploma or learn a trade, such as culinary arts or
medical assisting, Hodel said.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 students between the ages of 16 and 26 attend classes
at the center for up to 2 years. Older students with handicaps are
allowed to stay longer.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher's union is trying to organize about 100 counselors,
teachers, kitchen workers and security guards at the job center.
The workers want better pay and job security, said union organizer
Greg Kotecki.
</P>
<P>
   The agency operates on a $5 million grant from the U.S.
Department of Labor, said Wayne Smith, a spokesman from the Boston
office.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the U.S. Labor Department is not investigating the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any kind of grievance or complaint they might have is
something they should take up with Global,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Global Associates is a privately held contractor that does work
for the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Labor.

<HEADLINE> Judge hands motion picture industry a landmark victory over DVD piracy </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal judge Thursday gave the motion picture
industry considerable legal ammunition to protect DVDs from being
copied on computers.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling that further defines the legal boundaries of the
Internet, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conceded computer
codes were ''a matter of First Amendment concern,'' but he rejected
arguments they should receive maximum constitutional protection and
be exempt from government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Computer code is not purely expressive any more than the
assassination of a political figure is purely a political
statement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came in a case in which eight leading Hollywood movie
studios sued a Web site publisher to stop him from making available
online, or posting links to, software that descrambles the code
meant to prevent DVDs from being copied.
</P>
<P>
   The software, developed last year by a 15-year-old Norwegian
youth, has helped make it possible for computer users to copy
full-length feature films from digital versatile discs onto their
hard drives or other recordable media.
</P>
<P>
   Leon P. Gold, a lawyer for the Motion Picture Association of
America, said the ruling ''establishes once again that you cannot
take anyone's copyrighted work without permission.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, president and chief executive officer of the
Motion Picture Association of America, called Kaplan's 90-page
decision the ''stoutest defense of the sanctity of copyright that
I've ever read.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear. It is eloquent and, most of all, it has
absolutely no ambiguity whatsoever,'' Valenti said. ''I think this
is going to send a clanging alarm bell in the ear of every venture
capitalist.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a loss for Eric Corley, the editor and publisher
the Web site 2600.com and the print publication ''2600: The Hacker
Quarterly.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Garbus, a lawyer for Corley, said Kaplan's findings were
''what we expected'' and said he plans to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understood that this was an issue that has to be resolved
by the Supreme Court. The judge's First Amendment analysis is
wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Kaplan issued a preliminary injunction forcing
2600.com to remove the DeCSS code from his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, though, the Web site in what has been described as
an act of ''electronic civil disobedience'' has provided links to
nearly 500 other sites offering the DeCSS code.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the Web site obviously meant to frustrate the
effect of any ruling he might make.
</P>
<P>
   Gold said some damage had been done.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the floodgates never opened and I think this decision will
prevent the floodgates from opening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a 90-page ruling Thursday, Kaplan issued a
three-page final judgment finding that the posting of the DeCSS
code violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 law
aimed at controlling software piracy and the posting of copyrighted
material on Web sites.

   ''We always felt this was exactly the case the statute was
written for,'' Gold said. ''If the court had failed to file an
injunction, we didn't think there would be anything left of the
statute.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 47; Nasdaq Gains 80  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose modestly Thursday as oil producers
and brokerages powered the Dow, while semi-conductors and
fiber-optics makers charged the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average lifted 47.25 at 11,055.64.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 79.67 at 3,940.87, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 16.22 to 1,496.07.
</P>
<P>
   Trading remained light as it has been in recent days leading up
to next Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting. With numerous signs the
U.S. economy is cooling off, investors are betting the central bank
will leave interest rates steady.
</P>
<P>
   ''This market has been fairly lifeless recently. But if there's
been one theme -- and it's been hard to find one -- it's that
investors are concerned for earnings in the second half,'' said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've just gotten through the second-quarter earnings period
and the numbers were very strong. But the picture is not going to
be as pretty in the third and fourth quarters. So investors are
trying to find those industries and companies that won't be
affected by the slowdown in the growth of earnings,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson cited semiconductors, communications equipment, drug
companies, electric utilities and the oil sector as areas investors
believe may emerge relatively unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, shares of telecommunications parts maker Ciena
Corp. rose $15.938 to $179.188 on Thursday after the company
forecasted better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings based on
strong demand for fiber-optic parts.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement gave an across-the-board boost to telecom
equipment companies, including Nokia, which rose $2.313 at $41.438.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a surge from rising oil prices, petroleum producers
enjoyed a broad rally. Exxon rose $1.043 to $83.813 and Chevron
added $1.731 at $87.188.
</P>
<P>
   Intel led a rally among semiconductors, moving up $2 at $70.063.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that J.P. Morgan is in play as a merger target
fueled financial services stocks. J.P. Morgan rose $2.562 at $145
and Lehman Brothers rose $8.625 at $135.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard beat second quarter earnings estimates but
analysts expressed concern for the computer giant's second-half
profits, sending its shares down $12 to $108.
</P>
<P>
   Economic data released recently has signaled that the Federal
Reserve's strategy to slow the economy may be working. However,
while a slowing economy may prevent the Fed from raising interest
rates again this year, it also raises the specter of lower
second-half profits.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts consider the Fed's policy of cooling the economy
through higher interest rates a double-edged sword and are hoping
for a ''soft landing,'' meaning economic growth eases but not so
much that it hurts companies' bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good news is that the Fed probably won't raise interest
rates,'' Johnson observed. ''But the bad news is that the rate of
earnings will slow and that's what investors are focusing on.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues beat decliners by a narrow margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.11 billion
shares, down from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 3.72 to 516.46.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.19 percent,
Germany's DAX index was down 0.50 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.21 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.73 percent.

<HEADLINE> Students file lawsuit against high school's drug testing policy  </HEADLINE>
By HANAH CHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Three students filed a lawsuit against a
Hunterdon County high school Thursday, challenging what civil
rights activists say is a random drug testing policy for those who
park on campus or participate in athletics and extracurricular
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey filed the
lawsuit on behalf of the families of three students who attend
Hunterdon Central Regional High School in Flemington.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Salyer, a staff attorney with the ACLU, said the policy
violates student privacy rights under the state constitution and
provides no justifiable reason for testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Random suspicious-less testing is what it boils down to,''
Salyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The policy was adopted during the last academic year, but goes
into effect Sept. 8, Salyer said. It is an expansion of an existing
1997 policy that randomly tested student athletes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure how many students it will cover,'' Salyer said.
''At some point, it will be every student in the school.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed random drug testing for
student athletes if a school shows reasonable suspicion, but state
courts have been broader in interpreting individual privacy rights,
Salyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Salyer said although the New Jersey Supreme Court has never
ruled on a case involving school drug testing policies, a state
Superior Court judge stuck down a drug testing policy at
Carlstadt-East Rutherford Regional School District in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Ridgefield Park school district dropped a drug
testing policy after a lower court issued a temporary injunction
against the school for failing to justify the testing, Salyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Singling these students is not only unfair but
counterintuitive,'' he said. ''It's hard to show a special need
when they are the good kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The three students represented in the lawsuit include a varsity
gymnast, a Model United Nations participant and a writer with the
school's online literary magazine.
</P>
<P>
   High school officials barred Shaun Joye from participating in a
school play last spring when his parents refused to sign a consent
form authorizing the drug test, Salyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Students from Raritan, Readington, Delaware, East Amvell and
Flemington attend Hunterdon Central Regional High School.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Hunterdon Central Superintendent Judith Gray said she
couldn't comment on the lawsuit because she has not received a copy
of it.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message left for school board president John Brasell
was not immediately returned Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Jones Gets $90 Million Deal  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Finally announcing a deal that had been rumored
for weeks, NL MVP Chipper Jones and the Atlanta Braves agreed
Thursday on a six-year contract said to be worth $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 28, had been eligible to become a free agent after this
season. He has played his entire career in Atlanta after being
selected by the Braves with the first pick of the 1990 amateur
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having been born in this organization and grown up in this
organization, this is the only organization I know,'' Jones said.
''I would certainly love nothing more than to start my career here
and finish here.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which contains two club options that could make it
worth $120 million for eight seasons, would be the fourth-richest
package in baseball, trailing only Cincinnati outfielder Ken
Griffey Jr. ($116.5 million for nine years) Los Angeles pitcher
Kevin Brown ($105 million for seven years) and New York Mets
catcher Mike Piazza ($91 million for seven years).
</P>
<P>
   ''This kind of money is really unheard of,'' Jones said. ''It's
almost embarrassing to talk about because it's not where I came
from. You know, I came from the middle class, and we had to work
hard for what we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jones nor the Braves would confirm the financial terms
of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager John Schuerholz said he is not bothered
by paying astronomical salaries. He said Jones earned a paycheck
that matches his status as one of the finest position players in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a young man here who has established himself as one of
the real cornerstone players of this franchise of all time,''
Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he became the first major-leaguer to hit .300 (.319)
with 100 runs (116), 40 doubles (41), 40 homers (45), 100 RBIs
(110), 100 walks (126) and 20 stolen bases (25).
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jones is hitting .305 with 25 homers and 83 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' deal is believed to match Brown's average salary of $15
million. That average would be surpassed if the commissioner's
office decides Roger Clemens' $30.9 million extension with the New
York Yankees, announced last Friday, should be treated as a
two-year contract, not a three-year deal as the team announced.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is getting $4.75 million this season in the final year of
his contract.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Jones considered leaving the Braves.
Before the 1999 season, he thought about making a fresh start after
he publicly admitted fathering a child in an extramarital affair.
Jones said the fans in Atlanta quickly changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   With the boost in salary -- ''more money than I could ever
spend,'' Jones called it -- Jones said he will buy a ranch to run
with his father -- something he said he has wanted to do since he
was 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all about where you're the happiest, and I'm happiest
here,'' said Jones, a Florida native who lives just north of
Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Lazio pokes fun at Clinton campaign 'tracker'  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OWEGO, N.Y. (AP) - They call him ''the tracker.''
</P>
<P>
   A young man armed with a video camera and tape recorder has been
trailing Rep. Rick Lazio's Senate campaign for weeks now - and on
Thursday the candidate ended a stump speech outside the Tioga
County Courthouse by acknowledging him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me introduce someone else,'' Lazio told a small group of
supporters, explaining that ''tracker'' Eric Schultz is a
Democratic Party worker who has been following the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's all say hello to Hillary Clinton and the whole Clinton
campaign,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Twice before, Lazio has acknowledged Schultz on the campaign
trail. He offered him a slice of pizza a few weeks ago at a
Brooklyn pizzeria and on Tuesday, he gave Schultz his subway pass
after an appearance in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz declined to comment after being singled out by Lazio. He
referred questions to the state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''The person we send is respectful, he never disrupts events.
The fact that Rick Lazio is so worried about it makes you wonder
what he's hiding,'' said spokesman Peter Kauffmann of the state
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   While the whole encounter seemed like sophomoric political
hijinks, Lazio said he was disturbed by both Schultz and a man
dressed in an Uncle Sam suit who constantly asks Lazio to release
his tax returns. (The congressman has promised to do so by the end
of the month.)
</P>
<P>
   ''What I am disappointed about is what their intent is,'' Lazio
said. ''Their intent is a malicious ... to go around and to
distract and to undermine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island congressman left no doubt who is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're coordinated with the Clinton campaign, and she's got
an opportunity to speak out against it. She chooses not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathie Levine, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign, said
tracking is a common practice in political campaigns and Republican
trackers have attended many of Clinton's appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difference is she doesn't complain about it,'' Levine
said. She added, ''When Hillary's at a public event she assumes all
of her comments are public, and the same is true for Rick Lazio's
events.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign is so vexed that staffers sometimes put
placards in front of Schultz's camera and employ other
cat-and-mouse tactics to keep him from photographing Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the entire campaign recognizes Eric's escapades for
what they are, kind of laughable in a sad way,'' said campaign
spokesman Patrick McCarthy. ''Even the congressman recognizes that
and that is why a couple of times he has acknowledged him at
events.''

<HEADLINE> Sweep Leaves Indians Tired, Reeling  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- It was nearly 2:30 a.m. EDT Thursday by the
time the Oakland Athletics rallied for three runs in the ninth
inning to beat the Cleveland Indians and sweep a crucial three-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   Many Indians fans had gone to bed long before the A's mounted
their comeback from a 5-1 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland owner Larry Dolan was just sorry he wasn't one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately,'' Dolan said when asked if he had stuck it out
until the bitter end. ''And then I stayed up a little longer
afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians didn't return from their six-game West Coast road
trip until 8:30 a.m., and adding insult to injury, the team's bus
got caught up in morning rush-hour traffic as it approached
downtown Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   These days the wild-card standings are just as congested.
</P>
<P>
   After taking two of three games in Seattle, the Indians were
swept in Oakland, going 2-4 on the important trip. Cleveland is
three games behind the A's in the wild-card race, and the Indians
are behind Boston, too, in the battle for the final playoff spot,
too.
</P>
<P>
   And right behind the Indians are the Anaheim Angels and Toronto
Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Losing to the A's took away any momentum the Indians had built
while away. Now they head into a weekend series against the Seattle
Mariners. Cleveland will get another crack at the A's when Oakland
comes to town for three games next week.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's game, Cleveland manager Charlie Manuel had
assessed the importance of the series finale.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big game, but it's not the end of the world if we
don't win a game here. Any time there's a two-game swing, it's a
big game.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a big one to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' bullpen wasted a solid start from Chuck Finley, who
tired in the seventh after giving up three runs and seven hits in 6
1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Finley had gone more than six innings only one other time in his
last six starts, so Manuel turned to his relievers to close out the
win.
</P>
<P>
   But first Paul Shuey, then Steve Karsay and finally Bob Wickman
let the A's overcome the four-run deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ''From our standpoint there wasn't a lot of good things,'' said
Travis Fryman, who homered twice and drove in four runs. ''The
offense performed well and Chuck Finley pitched a good game, but
ultimately it wasn't enough. It's disappointing because we had a
chance coming in here to make up ground. That hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Indians were still awaiting word on Jaret Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who is out for the season, underwent arthroscopic
surgery on his right shoulder in Los Angeles on Thursday, and the
club had not heard what Dr. Lewis Yocum had found.
</P>
<P>
   Wright has a frayed labrum in the shoulder and the team was
hopeful that he would be able to rehab in time for the start of
spring training in February.

<HEADLINE> Mexico President-Elect Details Plan  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's president-elect proposed a new era
in U.S.-Mexico relations on Thursday, saying it is in the United
States' best interests to help its southern neighbor prepare for
open borders and a common market.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, who will travel to the United States and Canada
next week, said those countries should help Mexico develop in the
way that rich European countries helped the economies of Spain and
Greece grow in advance of tearing down their border fences.
</P>
<P>
   ''The central idea is that together, we can build a better
future for our nations,'' he said in a meeting with American
journalists. ''It's not give-away aid, but rather a plan in which
we all win.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox was elected July 2, ending 71 years of single-party rule in
Mexico. During the campaign and since his election, he has pledged
a new vision for Mexico, and relations with the United States are a
key part of that vision.
</P>
<P>
   While Fox has spoken before of his long-term dream of a common
North American market, he hadn't specified how he planned to
achieve it -- or how he would make it palatable to the United States
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he described for the first time a plan in which a
gradual opening of markets and borders would be accompanied by
specific economic goals on Mexico's part -- goals set in
negotiations with the two North American countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have clear goals over 5-10 years -- especially in the
case of Mexico -- in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates,
in terms of budget deficits,'' he said. ''These goals would be
agreed to by the three countries.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the opening of the border could occur gradually,
possibly beginning with free transit within a certain border zone,
or with a greater number of temporary visas for Mexican workers.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said Mexico would be willing to make concessions to achieve
a common market, including working to reduce illegal immigration --
something Mexico has long insisted is largely the United States'
responsibility -- and bringing its environmental standards up to
U.S. levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be the first to admit that at this moment we can't'' open
the borders, Fox said. ''It's a process.''
</P>
<P>
   But he predicted that the United States and Canada would agree
to the plan, because he said it's in their best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best thing that could happen to the United States is to
have a successful Mexico, a Mexico without poverty, a Mexico
without violence, a Mexico without drug smuggling, a Mexico with
employment opportunities for all, where people don't have to
migrate to the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a question of convenience. It's a question of
intelligence. It's a question of brotherhood, of friendship, of
solidarity.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the North American Free Trade Agreement was based
entirely on ''the bottom line,'' and insisted new agreements should
be made more in the spirit of partners.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the idea of a benevolent United States figures heavily
into Fox's proposal. In order to rewrite more than a century of
relations between the two countries, he is counting on a great deal
of good will from Mexico's northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Fox repeatedly mentioned the history of the European Union, in
which richer European countries insisted on decades of economic
changes among their poorer neighbors -- along with large amounts of
aid -- to bring their economies into line.
</P>
<P>
   Once the poorer countries had more comparable economies, the EU
was formed, removing border guards and opening trade between the
member nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't necessarily have to be the same'' as the European
Union, Fox said. ''But they can serve as inspiration for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Fox will take these ideas to the United States and
Canada. On Tuesday he will meet with Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, and on Wednesday will meet with business leaders in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   He will dine Wednesday night with leaders of the Mexican
community in New York before heading to Washington for meetings
Thursday with Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
candidate, President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, he will fly to Dallas to meet with George W.
Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, before returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who reportedly felt pushed aside by Gore and Bush during
his own campaign, laughed when asked who he preferred.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're the same,'' he said. ''They say I stick my foot in my
mouth a lot, but this time I'm not going to.''

<HEADLINE> Bombs Injure 21 in Latvia  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN C. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Two bombs ripped through crowds of
after-work shoppers in Latvia's capital on Thursday, injuring 21
people and sending bleeding victims staggering into the street.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers carried out others who had burns, broken limbs and
cuts, police and witnesses said. Three people had serious injuries,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs went off minutes apart at around 5:30 p.m. at the
five-story Centrs shopping center in the heart of Riga's
picturesque, medieval-era old town, police spokesman Krists
Leiskalns said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims was a top police official, Valdis Pumpers, who
suffered minor injuries. Police said they did not believe he was
the target, but didn't know of a motive. There was no warning or
claim of responsibility, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Leiskalns said investigators were considering
the possibility of a ''terrorist attack'' or a ''business
dispute.'' He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   There have been dozens of bombings in Riga since Latvia, a
former Soviet republic with a population of 2.5 million, regained
independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But injuries or deaths have been rare. Police say most of the
blasts are the result of mob turf battles or extortion rackets.
</P>
<P>
   Latvian President Vaira Vike-Freiberga condemned the attack and
said she was confident police would find the bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Police cordoned off the area as employees, many of them in tears
and some wearing bandages, milled around the cobblestone streets
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Bartender Valda Bernsons heard the blasts from an Irish pub a
block away and ran to the scene. She saw dozens of people, many
bleeding, pushing through the center's front doors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started shaking so much that I had to go back to the bar,''
said Bernsons, still looking shaken several hours later. ''I won't
be able to sleep tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Other passers-by said they were shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt the whole situation was unreal and couldn't be
happening in Riga,'' said Oksana Smirnova, a journalist near the
building when the blasts occurred. ''When I saw the injured, I knew
it was for real.''
</P>
<P>
   Centrs is considered the most popular shopping center in Riga,
with dozens of fashion boutiques and specialty shops. The bombs
went off in an area where people can check their bags while they
shop, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions occurred on the ground floor not far from the
Norwegian-owned Rimi grocery store. Its general director, Knut
Kviskvik, was among those seriously injured, although his condition
was not life threatening, the Baltic News Service reported. Details
about the other two serious injuries were not immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
   Baltic News Service called the explosion the worst since
independence.

<HEADLINE> Experts say two untreatable diseases have attacked state's tobacco crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH WINDSOR, Conn. (AP) - Two untreatable diseases have
attacked the Connecticut Valley's broadleaf tobacco crop,
threatening to destroy a large part of it.
</P>
<P>
   This year has seen the worst cases of the brown-spot and
hollow-stalk diseases to hit the Connecticut River valley in the
last 50 years, farmers and tobacco processors said Thursday. They
blame the summer's cool, wet weather for the outbreak of the two
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a major disaster,'' Sherwood Waldron, general manager of
South Windsor Tobacco Farms, a division of National Cigar Corp.,
told the Journal Inquirer of Manchester. ''A lot of people have had
to get rid of their crops.''
</P>
<P>
   The diseases attacked at a time when the blue mold epidemic that
plagued tobacco crops during the past three years has waned as a
result of effective countermeasures by farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural officials said broadleaf tobacco typically grows
best in hot, humid weather without too much rain.
</P>
<P>
   Brown spot is a fungus that causes rings or spots on leaves
containing dead tissue. The disease, which typically develops from
July through September, grows in the lower leaves and moves up the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Hollow stalk is caused by bacteria that invade the cell walls of
tobacco plants and soften the leaves and stalks. The two diseases
are usually found in mature or overripe tobacco crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the biggest outbreak in the last 50 years,'' says James
LaMondia, a plant pathologist at the Windsor-based Connecticut
Agricultural Experimental Station. ''Some crops have been severely
affected. Quite a few acres have had to be torn up.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadleaf tobacco is used as a wrapper in cigars. The leaves
must be free of blemishes to be marketable, LaMondia said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Eddy, executive director of the Farm Service Agency of
Hartford and Tolland counties, said that if the cool, damp weather
continues through September, about half of the roughly 2,400 acres
of broadleaf tobacco grown this year in the Connecticut River
valley will be lost to the two diseases.

<HEADLINE> Luginbill To Coach L.A. in XFL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Luginbill, coach of the Amsterdam Admirals
of NFL Europe for the past five seasons, was hired Thursday as
coach of the XFL's Los Angeles franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very fortunate to have a man with coach Luginbill's
experience,'' general manager John McKay Jr. said. ''He has been a
proven winner at all levels. Now, he gets to return home to
Southern California.''
</P>
<P>
   Luginbill, 53, led the Admirals to a 30-20 record, with the 30
wins ranking third among NFL Europe coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been following the formation of the XFL closely,'' he
said. ''I believe the football on the field is going to be first
class, and I am happy to get in on the ground floor of this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   Luginbill got his start in coaching at Pasadena, Calif., City
College, from 1968-71 and 1974-77. In between, he spent two years
as an assistant at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   He was an assistant coach at Wyoming in 1978, and then went back
to ASU as an assistant coach and administrator from 1979-85.
</P>
<P>
   Luginbill was head coach at San Diego State from 1989-93,
guiding the Aztecs to a 31-25-3 record. San Diego State went 8-4-1
in 1991 and played in the Freedom Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Xtreme Football League, jointly owned by NBC and the World
Wrestling Federation, begins play next February.
</P>
<P>
   Other franchises will be in Chicago; Las Vegas; Memphis, Tenn.;
Orlando, Fla.; San Jose, Calif.; Birmingham, Ala.; and New York/New

<HEADLINE> Helms Upset About Dalai Lama Snub  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, accused the United Nations of being
''weak-kneed'' for excluding the Dalai Lama from a conference of
religious leaders from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am upset,'' Helms, R-N.C., said in a letter Thursday to
Richard Holbrooke, U.S. ambassador to the world body.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 religious leaders have been invited to the
Millennium World Peace Summit on U.N. property this month, but the
Tibetan Buddhist leader was left out for fear of offending China.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Ambassador, can it be that the United Nations has chosen
to appease the Communist dictators in Beijing -- who drove the Dalai
Lama into exile in the first place and who continue to oppress the
Tibetan people -- rather than include one of the world's most known
and respected spiritual leaders?'' Helms wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surely you share my dismay that the organizers of a 'world
peace summit' would choose to exclude a Nobel Peace Prize winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, who was awarded the 1989 Nobel, fled Tibet in
1959 with thousands of supporters after a failed revolt against
Chinese rule of the mountain region.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is not an official sponsor of the summit,
which has received funding from Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation,
Better World Fund and others and was organized by a coalition of
interfaith leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But the first two days of the summit will be held in the U.N.
General Assembly chamber, and a U.N. official advised organizers
that China would be outraged if the Tibetan spiritual leader was
invited.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers asked the Dalai Lama to attend the last two days of
the conference and to give the concluding speech -- all scheduled at
a New York hotel, away from the United Nations. He declined.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering, scheduled for Aug. 28-31, will bring together
leaders of religious groups worldwide to discuss conflicts and
initiate religiously based efforts to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Glynn, a spokeswoman for Holbrooke, said he ''is as
upset as Senator Helms is that the Dalai Lama was not invited and
thinks that should be rectified immediately.''

<HEADLINE> Packers' Mitchell Gets His Chance  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Last year, Basil Mitchell had no idea
what he would do if the Green Bay Packers cut him.
</P>
<P>
   This week, injuries have turned Mitchell into Green Bay's
starting running back, giving him no time to think about his sudden
-- albeit temporary -- rise through the NFL's pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to Dorsey Levens and Ahman Green have put Mitchell on
top of the Packers' depth chart before their preseason game at
Miami. Mitchell, who had just 29 carries last year as Levens'
rookie backup, could get that many just Monday night at Pro Player
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not really a whole lot of pressure on me, because I've
been through this before,'' Mitchell said. ''I had to help out last
year in a lot of different ways. I'm not afraid to fight for a spot
on the team, and now I've got a great chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Sherman said the Packers are unlikely to sign a
veteran running back to tide them through the preseason and the
regular season's first two games, both because of salary cap issues
and the enormous amount of learning a new back would need to do in
a short time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a difficult thing to do, and besides, we like the
guys we have,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he didn't specifically mention Mitchell, Sherman's plan
amounts to a backhanded vote of confidence for his third-string
runner. Mitchell has proven his worth on special teams, and he has
impressed Packers coaches with his pass-blocking and pass-catching
abilities as a third-down back.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure whether Mitchell is ready to be the featured
runner in the Packers' offense -- except Mitchell, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can do it,'' Mitchell said. ''It's not the best situation
for our team because Dorsey is one of the best backs in the game,
but I can help out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is hoping to make the Packers' roster with a second
straight outstanding training camp. Though he came to Green Bay as
an undrafted free agent from Texas Christian in 1999, he was Green
Bay's leading rusher during the preseason and became one of the
team's top kickoff returners.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a guy who realizes he has to good at a lot of things to
be valuable to this team,'' Packers running backs coach Kippy Brown
said. ''He fills a lot of roles for us, and he makes the most of
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell thinks he did so well in training camp last year
because he had no fallback plan. He knew virtually nothing about
any NFL teams except the Packers and his hometown Dallas Cowboys,
and he had no idea whether anyone but Green Bay was interested in
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very motivated by that, and I'm still motivated today,''
Mitchell said Thursday. ''I fit into this team very well, and they
know what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mitchell was kicked in the same big toe he had
offseason surgery to fix. The minor, nagging injury kept him out of
three workouts, but on Thursday morning he was back at practice
despite lingering pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to come out and get some work,'' he said. ''I just
have to keep it taped up and keep getting treatment on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is needed for depth in practice as well as in games.
Levens had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee on Tuesday, and
Ahman Green sprained his knee Sunday at Denver. Both are
tentatively expected to be back in 3-4 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of training camp, Mitchell faced stiff competition
even for the third-string spot from rookie Rondell Mealey, but the
seventh-round pick blew out his knee in the first preseason game
and had ligament surgery this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of guys are going down, and that's not good, but it
helps me,'' Mitchell said. ''I have mixed feelings about a lot of
this.''

<HEADLINE> Twins Will Pitch Case for Outdoors  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Twins will learn Tuesday
whether they have the go-ahead from the Metrodome to play some
games outdoors next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins wanted the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission
to meet before then. But the state's open meetings law doesn't
allow it, said Bill Lester, executive director of the commission,
which owns and operates the dome, home to the Twins and Vikings
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Lester said a meeting to vote yes or no on the proposal was set
for Tuesday at the commission's offices inside the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is designed to drum up public support for a new
outdoor ballpark for the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Twins receive consent from the commission, they face
major barriers in getting their wish to play the Sept. 18-20 series
against Texas at a temporary 25,000-seat ballpark that would be
erected near the Mall of America.
</P>
<P>
   The club also would have to obtain authorization from the
commissioner's office, the players' association, the Rangers and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Twins met with Lester on Thursday to review
concerns that he had outlined in a letter Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In that letter, Lester told Twins general counsel Ben Hirst that
the Twins would have to reimburse the Metrodome for lost revenue
and also would need to address concerns over concession and sign
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission's biggest concern is a fear that the Vikings
would seize the opportunity to break their own lease, which runs
through 2011.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which would like to renovate the Metrodome into
a football-only facility, asked the Twins to get a guarantee in
writing from the Vikings stating that they wouldn't use such a
waiver as precedent to break their lease.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, who are pushing for a new stadium, refused.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like the word deal-breaker,'' Lester said of the
Vikings' rebuff. ''But that's a major obstacle.''

<HEADLINE> Tough Break for Mediate at PGA  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BAILEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Rocco Mediate came into the PGA
Championship sky-high after a victory in last week's Buick Open.
</P>
<P>
   He may leave Valhalla Golf Club flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Mediate suffered a freak injury before his 9:04 a.m. tee time
Thursday and could be forced to withdraw from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before my round, I went to sit on a chair where the caddies
gather on the patio outside the clubhouse and the chair
collapsed,'' Mediate said in a statement. ''I fell and landed on my
right side, injuring my neck, shoulder and lower back.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiff and sore, he played the opening round and struggled to a a
5-over-par 77.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it had not been the PGA Championship, I wouldn't have
played,'' the statement said. ''It bothered me most on iron shots
when I had to bend.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediate was expected to wait until Friday -- he has a 1:15 p.m.
tee time -- to decide whether to withdraw from the year's final
major.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was a sharp turn from the good fortune Mediate had
at the Buick. He never led, then birdied the last hole to tie
leader Chris Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Perry's first bogey in 29 holes gave Mediate his
fourth career victory.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   FAN BASE: Tiger Woods wasn't the only player drawing a raucous
crowd during Thursday's opening round.
</P>
<P>
   John Daly, who was an unlikely winner at the 1991 PGA
Championship, also commanded large galleries as he made his way
around Valhalla with playing partners Wayne Grady and Greg Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd gathered three- and four-deep at the seventh green
cheered loudly when Daly made an 8-foot birdie putt to reach 1
over.
</P>
<P>
   Shouts of ''You da man, John!'' and ''Grip it and rip it!'' were
heard often as he strolled from the greens to the tee boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Dave and Susan Blyford, of Cincinnati, followed Daly rather than
tournament favorite Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''John's just a regular guy who happens to be able to play
golf,'' Dave Blyford said. ''He's had his problems like most people
do, and he still keeps plugging along. You've got to love that.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly often acknowledged the crowd between holes, thanking them
for their support.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's fun to watch,'' Susan Blyford said. ''Besides, there's no
way we'd even get close to Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly finished Thursday with a 2-over 74.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   1990 AGAIN: Early in his first round, Wayne Grady played the
type of golf he hasn't since winning the 1990 PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Grady rolled in a 25-foot uphill putt to birdie the first hole,
then blasted out of a greenside bunker at the par-5 second hole and
watched the ball roll in for an eagle.
</P>
<P>
   He made the turn at 1 under, and two birdies and two bogeys on
the back side left him with that score entering the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy with the final score,'' said Grady, whose only title
since his major victory came at the 1991 Australian PGA.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got off to a very good start, then it was a bit of a mixed
bag after that. I drove it well but hit a few bad iron shots, so in
the end, 71 was a good score.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   YOU DO WHAT?: Jean Van de Velde wasn't surprised when playing
partner Mark Brown told him he was a club professional.
</P>
<P>
   But he was absolutely stunned to find out that Brown, who
finished Thursday at 1 under, makes his living selling clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked him, 'How often do you play?,' and he said 'Never,' ''
said Van de Velde, who shot a 70. ''That's pretty depressing for
us, isn't it? He doesn't even play every day of the year and he hit
the ball 10 times better than I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 34, the head professional at Tam O' Shanter Club in
Brookville, N.Y., said he was thrilled to be playing in his first
PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't sleep (Wednesday) night,'' he said. ''I hit a drive
on No. 1, hit a good wedge shot and made birdie. That kind of got a
load off me and I finally was able to start to play some golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde said Brown should ponder a career change.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is he thinking about? He's got the talent to be out here,
no doubt about it,'' Van de Velde said. ''He strikes the ball so
well and he is very athletic. He's got a good attitude and is very
relaxed. I think he should reconsider what he is going to do in his
next 10 years. If I was him, I would.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   DIVOTS: Dudley Hart, ranked 27th in the world, withdrew from
the tournament following a 79, citing severe back pain ... The
green at the par-3 eighth includes a massive valley on the left
side. John Daly hit an iron shot that looked as if it would stick
within a few feet of the hole, but the ball coasted down the hill.
''Thanks a lot, Jack,'' Daly said, referring to the course's
designer -- Jack Nicklaus.

<HEADLINE> At naval bases, tears, flowers and reminiscences mark memorial  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKEHURST, N.J. (AP) - Some wept quietly, some held single
carnations in memory. They giggled listening to some of the
eulogies. They fought back tears during others.
</P>
<P>
   And when a lone bagpiper began to play ''Amazing Grace,'' more
than 1,700 mourners crammed into the base gymnasium at Lakehurst
Naval Air Engineering Station sat deadly still, united in grief.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of our prayers and remembrances and ceremonies cannot do
the one thing we want most - that is, to bring them back,'' said
Vice Admiral Joseph Dyer, summing up the grim reality of the
memorial service held Thursday for nine of the 11 victims of last
week's midair plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the victims worked at the naval base, but all nine were
well-known to base staffers for their work in Naval aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a stage where framed color photographs of the
victims sat on easels, beneath a giant American flag that hung on
one wall, Naval officials and representatives of each victim's
family took turns reminiscing during the two hour and 45-minute
service Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   David Dahlen, 57, of Warminster, Pa., a retired U.S. Navy
commander who worked in logistics at a Navy facility in
Philadelphia, was remembered by his daughter as a NASCAR buff and
barber shop quartet singer. ''In my Mom's words, my Dad epitomized
the words 'an officer and a gentleman,''' said his daughter,
Debbie.
</P>
<P>
   Angelos ''A.J.'' George, 39, of Toms River, who worked in
foreign sales of military aircraft, was a former Eagle Scout who
considered ''Kool Aid, Pop Tarts, burritos and Busch beer'' the
four basic food groups, said his brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanical engineer Cindy Kovacs, 39, of Robbinsville was
remembered by friend Regina Celin as a dedicated mother, courageous
breast cancer survivor and an ''intelligent, great-looking babe
with killer legs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People have been saying the most wonderful things about you,''
Celin said, addressing Kovacs as if she were present. ''You'd be
embarrassed,'' she said, fighting back tears.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph P. Mari, 37, of Toms River, one of the pilots of the
Piper Navajo, loved to fly and used to tilt his wings to say hello
as he flew over his home, sister Susan Kearney said. ''Joe always
said, 'If I'm going to die, let it be in the air.' Well, Joe, you
got your wish,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The two planes collided over a subdivision about 10 miles south
of Trenton on Aug. 9, sending wreckage hurtling into a Burlington
Township home and setting it ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers implored the mourners to celebrate the lives of
the victims, not their untimely deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thirty-nine years of outstanding life will not be overshadowed
by one tragic day,'' said a man - he did not identify himself -
speaking on behalf of victim Robert G. Polo, 39, of Barnegat.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer and base commander Capt. Stephen Himes called the victims
''teammates of ours'' who died in service of their nation. U.S.
Rep. Chris Smith called them ''vital links in our national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   When the service ended, hundreds of the mourners stayed behind
to lay carnations on the table in front of the victims'
photographs. One widow knelt on both knees, crying and holding her
dead husband's photograph in her hands, kissing it.

<HEADLINE> Megan's Law notification delivered to state Capitol  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - In the building where Megan's Law was
created and signed, prosecutors went office to office in the state
Capitol Thursday to warn workers that a dangerous sex offender had
moved into the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   They visited staff members of legislators who voted for the
bill. They visited the governor's office, where it became law. And
they visited reporters - warning them not to share the information
with the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Under Megan's Law, community members are notified when convicted
sex offenders deemed to pose a continuing threat move into an area.
Some notifications are limited to schools and day-care centers. But
those involving the highest-risk offenders are given out door to
door to residents and to people who work in the area.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the convict is a 65-year-old disabled man who
lives a few blocks away from the Capitol and has been classified as
a posing a high risk of committing another offense.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, community members notified about offenders must
not share the information with anyone who does not live or work in
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for violating that provision is a contempt of court
charge. However, the state Supreme Court ruled recently that the
penalty clause of the law was illegal. That ruling has been
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters based at the Statehouse huddled with their editors
after being informed of the notification meeting. Fliers with
information about the sex offender were given only to those who
signed a form pledging to keep it confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a highly unique and peculiar circumstance,'' said
Mercer County Prosecutor Daniel Giaquinto, who conducted the
notification meetings personally.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Supreme Court ruling, Giaquinto told reporters they
still could face contempt-of-court censure from Superior Court
Judge Andrew Smithson if they reported specific information about
the sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time warning notices were delivered to the
Statehouse and state offices around it.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman, who signed the act into law on Oct. 31,
1994, was in Los Angeles Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The law was named for 7-year-old Megan Kanka, who was raped and
murdered six years ago by a convicted sex offender who was living
across the street.

   Deputy Attorney General Steven Finkel said if Megan's Law is to
survive court challenges, the sanctity of the information
disseminated about sex offenders is crucial.

<P>
   ''We are at risk of losing the protection of the law,'' Finkel
said. ''We are doing this for your personal safety.''

   A spokesman for the Public Defender's Office said distributing
the information to the media is troubling.

information contained within Megan's Law notices,'' spokesman Jeff

<HEADLINE> Defendant in Watkins slaying indicted on first-degree murder  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A grand jury has indicted a Brooklyn man on
first-degree murder charges in the fatal mugging of a graduate
student from Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, filed Thursday in state Supreme Court in
Brooklyn, alleges David Jamison, 27, stabbed Amy Watkins in the
back as she was walking home after dark on March 8, 1999. Last
week, an alleged lookout in the fatal robbery, Felix Rodriguez, was
indicted on second-degree murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Charles Hynes has 120 days from the time
Jamison is arraigned to decide whether to pursue a capital case; no
date for arraignment was set. Hynes has sought the death penalty in
seven other times.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison's attorney, Samuel Gregory, said Thursday that his
client denies the charges. So has Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Lawrence Watkins told reporters he wanted a
severe prison sentence for his child's killer. ''The death penalty
would almost be an easy way out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Watkin's slaying shocked her neighbors in Prospect Heights, a
quiet neighborhood of brownstones a short subway ride from
Manhattan. It came at a time when the city was in the midst of a
dramatic downturn in violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, 26, who was raised in Topeka, Kansas, was studying for
her masters in social work, counseling battered women and working
with children. On the night of her death, she had taken the subway
home from the Bronx, where she was an intern at a community center.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Jamison, Rodriguez and possibly a second accomplice
saw Watkins walk by the restaurant they were in, and decided she
would be an easy robbery target.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins apparently struggled with her attacker before being
stabbed once in the back with a 10-inch kitchen knife, police said.
The bandits fled with only a few dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives picked up Jamison for questioning on Aug. 2 based in
part on a tip from a caller to the Crime Stoppers hot line. A
$12,000 reward had been offered.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that during an interrogation, Jamison agreed
to give a videotaped confession. His attorney said he would be
''challenging that statement on a number of different grounds.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The body parts of a woman were found in the East
and Hudson rivers less than 15 hours apart, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Examiner's Office determined the pieces were those
of a black or Hispanic woman. Although the body was not badly
decomposed, it was going to take more time to determine how and
when the woman was killed, said spokeswoman Ellen Borakove.
</P>
<P>
   One set of body parts was discovered just before midnight
Wednesday, when a plastic bag was found stuck in the hull of a Con
Edison barge in the East River near 14th Street and the FDR Drive,
police said. The parts contained a left leg from the knee to the
foot, a right thigh, and two arms with no hands.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1 p.m. Thursday, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers vessel
traveling north in the Hudson River near Battery Park picked up a
blue Samsonite suitcase, police said. Inside, they discovered three
plastic bags containing a head, two hands, a left thigh, and a
right leg below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Police were handling the investigation.

<HEADLINE> More infected birds, mosquitoes prompt further spraying for West Nile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - New evidence of West Nile virus in four of the
city's five boroughs will lead to more pesticide spraying to kill
disease-carrying mosquitoes, city officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Three birds - one in Central Park, one in northern Manhattan and
one in Queens - tested positive for the virus this week. In
addition, 27 mosquito pools infected with West Nile were found in
Staten Island, Manhattan and the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the city will spray the affected
areas this week, including Central Park on Friday night and again
on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Three elderly Staten Island residents have been infected with
the virus this summer. All are recovering.

<HEADLINE> Wildwood ride worker loses leg in Haunted House ride mishap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILDWOOD, N.J. (AP) - A 19-year-old amusement ride worker lost
his leg after it became entangled in the track of the ride during
operation, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Jackson, a college student from Ireland who was working
here for the summer, had his left leg amputated Wednesday night on
the Monster Mash Haunted House ride, Lt. Steven Long said.
</P>
<P>
   The ride consists of a series of open cars that travel on an
enclosed track through the haunted house, which is a converted
movie theater. Jackson's job was to jump out of the darkness to
scare riders, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somehow, he either tripped or just got entangled in the
track,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was taken by helicopter to Atlantic City Medical Center,
where he was listed in fair condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was shut down after the accident and will remain so
pending an investigation by the state Department of Community
Affairs, which regulates amusement rides in New Jersey, according
to department spokesman E.J. Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda did not know when the last time a worker was injured on
an amusement ride in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration also is
investigating the accident.

<HEADLINE> Feds Say Laser Project Cost Soars  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Soaring development costs for the world's most
powerful laser could threaten a Clinton administration plan to
ensure the readiness of U.S. nuclear weapons in the absence of
actual testing, lawmakers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators reported that the laser project at
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory will cost more than $2.8
billion, nearly triple the original price from five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has told Congress the project will now
cost at least $2.2 billion, which is 50 percent higher than its
estimate only six months ago, according to a report by the General
Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   ''These new findings significantly heighten congressional
concerns about ... the viability of the stockpile stewardship
program,'' said Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The project is now expected to be completed in 2008, six years
later than the original target date.
</P>
<P>
   The laser, the most powerful and sophisticated ever built, has
192 laser beams focusing energy on a single target, allowing
nuclear scientists to simulate in a laboratory conditions in a
thermonuclear explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by super computers and other technology, nuclear weapons
scientists will be able to assure the reliability of America's
nuclear warheads without detonating nuclear devices. Nuclear bomb
testing was halted in 1993 with assurances that data needed to
assure weapon readiness eventually would be simulated in the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Madelyn Creedon, deputy administrator the DOE's nuclear weapons
agency, said that the laser project will ''go ahead as planned,''
but that its management team has been replaced and the DOE has
established a separate office to oversee the program. She said the
department would release firm cost figures next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The DOE has the job of maintaining the (nuclear weapons)
stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing ... and (the laser
project) is an integral part of the program,'' she said in a
conference call with reporters to discuss the GAO findings.
</P>
<P>
   The report by GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, concluded
that Lawrence Livermore has mismanaged the project, formally known
as the National Ignition Facility. The report also said that
technical problems, unexpected expenses and scheduling delays were
withheld from outside reviewers and the department.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairman of the House Science
Committee, which requested the report, said the cost escalation was
''alarming.'' He added, ''The fact that DOE's own independent
reviews masked the cost overruns is even more disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   The department learned only last summer that the laser program
was having problems, but officials have insisted that there are
major technical troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some lawmakers have questioned whether the program should
continue. An attempt to scuttle it fell short in the House this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Spence said the rising cost was ''extremely disquieting'' and
that the report ''raises legitimate questions about the ability of
the DOE's science-based approach'' as a substitute to nuclear
testing.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO attributed the cost overruns to an unrealistic original
budget, poor management at Lawrence Livermore and ''an absence of
effective independent reviews'' and department oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found that senior managers of the laser
project withheld their concerns about the technical and management
problems from the department and the director of the Livermore Lab,
which is operated by the University of California.

<HEADLINE> More Must-See-Tiger TV  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to golf these days, it seems every producer
figures it's ''Must-See-Tiger TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the only golfer that's taken golf from the third, fourth,
fifth page of the sports page to the very front page of a lot of
newspapers,'' said Lance Barrow, coordinating producer of CBS
Sports' coverage of the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you ever get too tired of watching Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers might have at last week's Buick Open, when The Golf
Channel showed Woods on tape instead of first-round leaders live.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Sports had vowed to avoid the same type of folly with
Thursday's first-round coverage of the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   When TNT's golf coverage started, at 1 p.m. EDT, viewers saw
Woods and playing partner Jack Nicklaus on tape or live, almost
exclusively, for the first hour.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at about 2:45, viewers saw another package of taped
highlights of Woods. And, just in case anyone had missed it, there
was another recap of Woods' day at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   His round started more than three hours before the CBS-produced
telecast went on the air from Valhalla Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   What was nearly impossible to determine while watching, though,
was that Masters champion Vijay Singh was the third member of
Woods' threesome.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, apparently, didn't merit much coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Scott Dunlap, whose 6-under 66 tied him with Woods for
the clubhouse lead.
</P>
<P>
   All that face-time for Woods means airtime for his sponsors,
which Justin Leonard thinks could eventually help other golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Non-golf companies are stepping up and saying, 'You know, we
can get a lot of exposure (by sponsoring Woods).' And they all
can't have Tiger,'' Leonard, the 1997 British Open champion, said
on ESPN's ''Outside the Lines'' last weekend. ''They all want him.
But they all can't have him or afford him. And when that doesn't
happen, then maybe some of that trickles down to me.''
</P>
<P>
   TNT (on at 1 p.m. EDT Friday, 10:30 a.m. EDT Saturday and
Sunday) will get Woods' group live in the second round. CBS takes
over at 1:30 p.m. EDT during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''Three or four years ago, you tended to do a broader-based
coverage of a tournament. More golfers got on television,'' said
Turner Sports Senior Vice President Mike Pearl.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, obviously no matter what the story lines are, whether
Tiger is playing well or not playing well, you're focusing a good
bit of coverage on Tiger because the ratings have indicated that
people like to watch Tiger play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratings do tend to be 50-100 percent higher when Woods plays,
but could viewers eventually burn out?
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to get it. The players are already tired of it,''
CBS analyst Gary McCord said. ''But you can't talk about somebody
else when he's pulverizing the field.''
</P>
<P>
   David Feherty, also with CBS, says Woods creates a whole other
set of problems for announcers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew what was possible for me as a player, and part of my
job is to be there on the ground and predict what is possible for
the players. And in that sense, he's redefined my job. I'm not
qualified,'' Feherty said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost as though he skipped a genetic generation, if you
like. There's such a difference between what he can do and what the
next guy can do.''
</P>

   BUD'S BEST: The scoreboard wasn't ready for Nadia Comaneci at
the 1976 Montreal Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw the scoreboard turning around, and it was 1.00,''
Comaneci recalls, ''and I was like, 'Whoa, that's not so good.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Romanian, of course, had earned a 10 for her routine on the
uneven bars -- the first perfect score in gymnastics history. As the
public address announcer pointed out to the crowd, the scoreboard
had not been programmed to flash numbers higher than 9.95.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of several tidbits in ''Bud Greenspan's Favorite
Stories of Olympic Glory,'' a collection of five documentaries,
airing Sunday at 10 p.m. on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   The program opens with riveting pieces about Comaneci;
Australian swimmer Duncan Armstrong and his excitable coach, Laurie
Lawrence; and Ethiopian marathoner Abebe Bikila. All three are
moving, informative and well-shot. The last two pieces, about
Russian wrestler Alexander Karelin and decathlete Dan O'Brien, are
not as dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who has won Emmy and Peabody Awards for his sports
chronicles, wrote, directed and produced; Will Lyman narrates.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TRIALS AND ERRORS: Viewers get two chances this weekend to
preview NBC's all-tape coverage of the Sydney Games -- taped
coverage of the U.S. Olympic swimming trials at Indianapolis and
the gymnastics trials at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The gymnastics will be shown on tape Saturday from 8-10 p.m.
EDT/PDT and Sunday from 12-2 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   There will be, however, two hours of live coverage Sunday,
starting at 7 p.m. EDT, and including the announcement of the
six-member team by Bela Karolyi's selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   Action from the second half of the swimming trials will be
packaged into a two-hour show airing Saturday at 4 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   The new bodysuits are ''definitely the biggest buzz on the deck
here,'' analyst Rowdy Gaines said. ''I think it's a great
innovation for our sport. It gives swimming a lot of publicity --
any kind of publicity would be good.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LEAVING EARLY: Fox Sports switched to the Reds-Cubs game
Saturday after the Braves finished beating the Dodgers. Good call.
</P>
<P>
   But then, at 4:27 p.m. EDT, with the Reds leading the Cubs 3-0,
runners at second and third, two outs, and Mark Grace batting ...
Fox went to the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ''And that is, due to contractual obligations, where we must
leave you,'' anchor Keith Olbermann said. ''I apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Within about a minute, Grace flew out to left off Danny Graves
to end the game.

<HEADLINE> Cold Weather Hits Sydney  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN PYE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Less than a month before the Summer
Olympics, the word from Sydney is: Brrrrr!
</P>
<P>
   Fans huddled in their warmest winter clothes and athletes donned
full body suits as the Australian Olympic track trials opened
Thursday, with organizers hoping for better weather as the city
becomes the focus of international attention.
</P>
<P>
   A chill descended on the 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium at the
trials as the sun made a brief appearance before setting behind a
nearly empty western stand. The high temperature Thursday was 51
degrees and the forecast for the next three days ranged from
temperatures of 48 to 68 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The weather forecast was for intermittent showers Friday and
Saturday, with skies clearing Sunday. The forecast high for Friday
was 61.
</P>
<P>
   The unseasonal cold snap, which is causing temperatures to
plummet below freezing in the Blue Mountains about 30 miles west of
the stadium, was expected to continue through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The games open Sept. 15, in the early stage of the Australian
Spring.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, snow dusted the outskirts of Sydney but
meteorologists said the demise of La Nina, which brought
near-record rainfall and severe flooding to parts of Australia the
past two years, has increased the possibility of dry weather for
the games.
</P>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
has expressed concern about the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Australian weathermen said they expect a return to normal
conditions -- mostly dry, with temperatures ranging between 54 and
70 degrees -- in Sydney during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   It was far less pleasant than that on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators huddled in scattered groups to witness the last
tune-up event for the Sydney 2000 centerpiece before the opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated more than 100,000 tickets had been sold for
the three-day trials but only a few thousand people braved the
overcast and gloomy conditions on the opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Mason, who flew to Sydney from interstate to get a sense
of the pre-games atmosphere, said it was too cold to enjoy the
selection trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be okay in a packed crowd, that would keep you
warm,'' he said. ''I can see there'd be a great buzz also with all
the foreign stars, but it's not that great today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain held off but the breeze that swirled consistently around
the stadium was enough to make some athletes shiver, including
sprinter Matt Shirvington.
</P>
<P>
   Shirvington, wearing a full-length bodysuit, qualified fastest
in heats of the men's 100 meters, clocking 10.29 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wore the suit because I felt comfortable in it this
morning,'' Shirvington said. ''It's not a statement or anything.
It's not that warm really, but it's better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got another suit that I'll probably wear in the next few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't happy with his race but was confident he'd
perform better in a head-to-head against Patrick Johnson in
Friday's final.
</P>
<P>
   For most athletes, the trials are the last chance to gain a spot
on the Australian team and the rare privilege of competing in an
Olympics on home soil.
</P>
<P>
   The first day took its toll, with Atlanta silver medalist Louise
Currey falling and injuring her knee after produced the winning
throw in the women's javelin. She has suspected ligament damage and
is in extreme doubt for the games.
</P>
<P>
   Clair Fearnley, favorite for the 1,500 meters, collapsed with a
suspected hamstring strain late in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable absentee was dual 400-meter world champion
Cathy Freeman, Australia's top hope for a gold medal on the track
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, who took silver behind Marie-Jose Perec at Atlanta in
1996, has already qualified for the Olympics and chose to continue
competing in Europe rather than return Down Under for the trials.
</P>
<P>
   Australia has not won a track gold medal since Debbie
Flintoff-King won the women's 400 hurdles at Seoul in 1988, but
team officials are predicted the athletics team to pick up six
medals in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> New-Generation Concorde Discussed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The grounding of the Concorde following a fatal
crash does not spell the end for supersonic passenger jets,
France's transport minister said Thursday, suggesting that a
second-generation aircraft could take its place.
</P>
<P>
   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot said that a new
generation supersonic aircraft could be a European or even a world
venture that would include the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gayssot spoke on Europe-1 radio a day after France and Britain
withdrew the Concorde's airworthiness certification, meaning that
it is now illegal for the aircraft to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawing certification is not irreversible, the minister
said. However, modifications must be made before the jet -- which
flies twice the speed of sound -- can take off again.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the death of the Concorde,'' Gayssot said. ''This
is not the death of supersonic flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspension of the airworthiness certification was recommended by
investigators studying the July 25 crash just after takeoff of a
New York-bound Concorde that killed 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say high-velocity debris from a tire that ruptured on
takeoff punctured a fuel tank, leading to a catastrophic fire and
engine failure.
</P>
<P>
   French and British aviation officials met Thursday in London to
discuss possible modifications. ''Both sides share the same
determination to work together to find a solution to put Concorde
safely back into service,'' said a brief statement after the
five-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde was developed in the 1960s by France's Sud-Aviation
and British Aircraft Corp. Before the crash, the Concorde had
avoided disaster for 31 years. No other commercial aircraft comes
close to its speed; the sleek jet zipped between Europe and New
York in under four hours.

<HEADLINE> Candle manufacturer to create 555 jobs in Hudson Valley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAUGERTIES, N.Y. (AP) - Candle maker Clearly Tech will invest
$6.75 million in its new plant here and create 555 jobs, the Ulster
County Development Corporation announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Tech, a private label candle manufacturer, will create a
research and development lab, headquarters and manufacturing plant
in the 200,000-square-fdoot, five-building plant formerly operated
by Phillips. Production of 23 million scented candles per year is
scheduled to begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The company, with operations in Norcross, Ga., will make 200 new
hires immediately and grow to 555 by the end of five years. The
jobs include production, customer service, design, finance,
marketing and technical positions in the research and development
lab.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Tech makes candles under labels including Pottery Barn,
Bath &AMP; Body Works, the Gap, and Clairol Herbal Essence. It also has
its own brands including Perfumes Isabell.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> No Dunking Allowed at Big Man Camp  </HEADLINE>
By GORDON SAKAMOTO
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Some of the flashiest dunkers in basketball were
at Pete Newell's Big Man Camp last week. Not one was allowed to
show his stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The motto of the weeklong camp: Leave your dunks at the door.
You're here to work.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis in the sessions -- NBA players in the morning and
collegians in the afternoon -- focused primarily on foot work. It
may sound like a simple task, but some the biggest names in the
sport encountered difficulty in mastering the nuances of movement.
</P>
<P>
   Newell, who will soon turn 85, took an active on-the-court role
in running the camp for forwards and centers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to introduce you to your feet,'' he told the group at
the first get-together. ''This is not about how well you can dunk.
It's about moving your feet the right way -- to get into position.
</P>
<P>
   ''The quality of your shot is going to depend on it. You have to
get space between you -- the offensive player -- and the defensive
player. The only way to get it is through your footwork.''
</P>
<P>
   As the session progressed, Newell moved from group to group on
the court, demonstrating the proper technique in positioning to
receive a pass, spacing and the options available in going to the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all down there,'' he told Austin Croshere of the Indiana
Pacers, pointing to his white sneakers. ''Move 'em. Get in
position. Square up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He teaches you the basics you have to have,'' a sweat-drenched
Croshere said after the workout. ''It's not how strong or athletic
you are. If you don't have proper footwork, it'll be hard to
score.''
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, Newell noted, the frontcourt player is not
the focal point in the offense at the college level. With the
emphasis on flex and motion offenses, the role of the big man is
primarily to screen.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's another story at the professional level.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the NBA, especially with the 24-second clock, the big man
has to play a lot of isolation basketball,'' Newell said. ''It's 90
percent feet and 10 percent ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp is a refresher for the pros, but for the collegians,
including overall No. 1 draft pick Kenyon Martin, it's also a
lesson in transition from playing facing the basket to playing with
backs to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to help the younger players with what changes to
expect when they move up to the NBA,'' Newell said. ''What the NBA
is all about -- playing against players with equal skills in every
game, the 24-second clock and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasizes to the players that there will be no full-court
games and, again, reminds them of the no dunking rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll do one-on-one, two-on-two, three-on-three,'' he said.
''That's it. Again, the emphasis will be on footwork --
strengthening the less-dominant leg -- spacing, recognizing
defenses. Those kind of things.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the frontline being the springboard to the
offense in the pros, Newell said, ''Of the top 20 centers, you'll
probably find that about 15 were born outside this country. That
can't be disputed. That's how they play the game over there.''
</P>
<P>
   The drills Newell has used in the 23 years of the camp are not
easy.
</P>
<P>
   And if they aren't done precisely, the players repeat the drill.
Those who struggle are pulled from the group and given individual
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not surprising because a lot of the things we do (at
the camp) are not done too much today,'' Newell said of the
repetitive drills.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a lifelong career in basketball as a player, coach,
administrator and teacher, Newell admits he is still learning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I'm a better teacher than before,'' he said. ''Like
anything else, since I keep doing it year after year, I think I've
gotten better at it.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I still learn a lot of things from the players. Even if
you've been in this game a long time, there are certain things you
don't know. You just keep going, just like the players do.''
</P>
<P>
   The pros were sent by their teams, while the college players --
with permission from their coaches -- had to apply for a spot in the
camp.
</P>
<P>
   That says a lot about Newell's camp, considering a lot of
coaches don't like others instructing their players.
</P>
<P>
   ''We assume if they're here, it's because they want to be
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want any player who is here just because their coach
said you got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Man Camp got its start 23 years ago in California when
Kermit Washington, then with the Los Angeles Lakers, asked for help
in developing his skills. The camp was moved to Hawaii seven years
ago.

<HEADLINE> Task force to try to guard integrity of horse racing  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Harness horse trainers, drivers and owners
support the New Jersey Racing Commission's decision to get tough on
the industry, a trade group spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission this week created a special task force to police
the industry against drugged-up horses and unscrupulous workers - a
plan applauded by the industry, said Pat Salerno, executive
administrator of the Standardbred Breeders and Owners Association
of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way to get to the bottom is to get them to
investigate,'' Salerno said. ''I'd say 99 percent of the industry
is 100 percent honest, but there's always a small majority that's
questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Freehold-based trade group represents 2,500 horse trainers,
owners, breeders and drivers in the harness racing industry.
Harness racing is big business in New Jersey, with the Meadowlands
Race Track alone awarding more than $50 million in annual purses.
</P>
<P>
   But it's an industry that has also had its troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, a judge sentenced harness horse driver Richard
Wojcio to five years probation, $7,500 in fines and 500 hours of
community service for conspiring to fix races at Freehold Raceway.
He was cleared of charges of fixing races.
</P>
<P>
   Wojcio won 405 races and more than $2.4 million in purse money
in 1995, the year before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Racing Commission Deputy Director Michael Vukcevich said the new
task force was created to prevent problems from worsening.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is purely a precautionary measure to make sure the
commission stays one step ahead of individuals who don't follow the
rules,'' Vukcevich said.
</P>
<P>
   One area that concerns the commission is the practice of some
harness racing workers continuing to work in the field after they
have lost their licenses to suspension
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to create an awareness in the industry that such
action won't be tolerated. Not only do we want to punish
individuals but we want to create a deterrent effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vukcevich said the committee will also look into remarkable
changes in individual horses' performances, ''to confirm that there
is no illicit activity afoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel will also determine whether the commission's
laboratory is properly screening blood and urine samples from
horses. Under state law, the horses are not allowed to have any
foreign substances in their systems on race day.
</P>
<P>
   Industry regulators must quickly respond to the newest illegal
substances given to race horses to enhance their performance,
Vukcevich said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, about seven horses were stripped of their winnings
when a post race test was positive, the state official said. That
was out of more than 800 tests given, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main point here is that the vast majority of people in
racing are fair and honest and what we have to do is make sure that
the playing field remains level,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - While Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton will talk at length about health care, education and job
creation, there is one subject - her marriage - that she studiously
avoids.
</P>
<P>
   But the subject keeps coming up.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just two days before she arrived in Los Angeles with
the president for the Democratic National Convention, he talked
with a group of ministers about his affair with Monica Lewinsky,
saying it was a ''terrible mistake'' and that he had been working
hard on rebuilding his life.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Texas Gov. George Bush, aboard his presidential
campaign plane, told reporters that Clinton's personal behavior in
the White House had ''embarrassed the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the first lady sat down for an interview with The
Associated Press at her Los Angeles hotel. The smiles and
chattiness evident throughout most of the interview disappeared
when the subject of her husband and Bush's comments was raised.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has expressed his own feelings about that ...
All the rest of us are focused on the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about what Bush had said and whether such comments were
too personal, she said, ''I'm going to keep talking about the
issues in this campaign because there are such big differences that
affect the lives of American families.''
</P>
<P>
   And how is her family doing? ''We're doing fine,'' she said
simply.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the state of her marriage is a campaign issue,
according to polls that have consistently shown her trailing her
Republican opposition - first Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and now Rep.
Rick Lazio - among white women, a crucial voting bloc. Interviews
with those women show that some resent what they see as her riding
her husband's coattails. Others believe she should not have stuck
with the president in light of his infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned Monday, just before her speech to the convention,
about her husband's remarks to the ministers, the first lady told
ABC's Peter Jennings that ''he's the best spokesman for what he
feels and what he wants to tell the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a wife's answer,'' Jennings suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I think my business and my family is really to be kept
private,'' she said. ''I don't think it is anyone else's
business.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS's Dan Rather had little luck when he tried to get the first
lady to open up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very grateful for our family and for the effort and work
that goes into any family and I've nothing to add to what he said
the other day when he spoke,'' she said. ''I think that this
convention, his remarks tonight, this election is about the future
and that's what we're going to keep talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Larry King got a similar response when he asked how she
was doing emotionally in the wake of her husband's affair.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know that's my business, and I don't talk about my
personal business and I feel strongly that what goes on in a
marriage or a family should remain in that marriage and in that
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady did attempt to answer some questions about her
marriage and her husband's infidelity in an interview with Talk
magazine that appeared a year ago. In it she said her husband's
cheating amounted to a ''sin of weakness'' and that she had stayed
with him out of love. But the interview seemed to make things
worse. Some of her statements seemed to imply she was blaming her
husband's infidelity on psychological abuse he had suffered as a
child when his mother and grandmother battled over who should care
for him.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the magazine hit the streets, the first lady told
reporters during a visit to a furniture factory in Jamestown that
she didn't mean to excuse her husband's infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is responsible for their behavior and I am a very
strong proponent and believer in personal responsibility, so I hope
that people will take that message away from this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she was done talking about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   I've said all I'm going to say on that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really believe strongly that the country has put that issue
behind it. I have as well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she has talked about her marriage since then. In
January, she told a Buffalo television interviewer that she planned
to spend the rest of her life with her husband. The very next
morning, she told a Buffalo radio talk show host she had never been
unfaithful in her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were spending this weekend near Lake Placid in the
Adirondacks, celebrating the president's 54th birthday.

<HEADLINE> Motorized scooters law expected to reach Assembly by fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Last summer, Brigantine Police Chief
William Ferris took a stand against motorized scooters. He had a
stack of complaints against the new slow-speed vehicles, but he
didn't know exactly how they were supposed to be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   He appealed to the state Division of Motor Vehicles for guidance
after one juvenile who was riding a scooter in the street ignored a
stop sign, causing a car to break hard in order to avoid hitting
him.
</P>
<P>
   The DMV considers scooters motorized vehicles subject to the
same traffic laws as mo-peds.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that opinion, the chief used a local newspaper to
warn teens that careless driving will not be tolerated. Ferris only
had to confiscate one scooter before the situation got under
control.
</P>
<P>
   ''After that article appeared, the scooters all but disappeared
from the streets ... with exception of a few,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem persists in other communities, including
Barnegat, Belmar, Ramsey and Stafford, said the lawmaker who
drafted a bill that would prohibit scooters on public streets and
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have unlicensed drivers operating unregistered and
uninsured vehicles. It's a real problem,'' said Assemblyman Kenneth
LeFevre, R-Atlantic. The bill would require scooters to be insured
and registered with the municipality where the owner lives.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Barnegat police, fed up with people riding scooters
on sidewalks and jumping curves as if they were on skateboards,
announced they would issue summonses to operators of unregistered
scooters they find on public property - and possibly confiscate
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's ironic is that kids are wearing all kinds of protective
gear with skateboards, but they're not using any protective gear
with the scooters and they go much faster,'' LeFevre said. His bill
would require operators to wear a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   LeFevre expects the bill to reach the full Assembly for a vote
this fall. He had hoped it would become law sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only a matter of time before something happens,'' he
lamented, noting that teen-age operators are flying through
intersections of busy streets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, a town could designate a public area for their
use.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular models, the Go-Ped, is made by
California-based Patmont Motor Werks and retails for about $439. It
weighs about 20 pounds, is foldable, and gets about 20 miles on a
quart of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Sullivan, a DMV spokesman, said his department is
''skeptical'' that motorized scooters can be operated safely.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think they are less safe than a bicycle. The wheels are so
small, and they rely so much on the person's balance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the legislation goes forward, and municipalities can
designate a confined area for these vehicles to be used, he said,
''then we'll try to help everyone involved.''
</P>
<P>
   John Tiene, executive director of the Insurance Council of New
Jersey, said scooters could be covered under a typical homeowner's
policy, but the insurance industry would probably have to create a
new insurance product for their use in the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The legislation creates its own special class (for
scooters),'' he said. ''This has to be researched.''

<HEADLINE> Jack Nicklaus' Heart is Heavy  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The story was sad enough to make the rest
of us cry. It only made Jack Nicklaus more determined to play golf.
</P>
<P>
   A man doesn't win 18 majors without motivation, but for perhaps
the first time in the career of the game's greatest player, you had
to wonder what Nicklaus was using for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the fourth hole of a practice round Wednesday when the
news he'd been dreading for a long time caught up with him: Helen
Nicklaus, the mother he would remember a day later as ''a tough old
girl,'' was dead, five days short of her 91st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The family resemblance was never sharper than Thursday, when
Nicklaus hovered over a final putt on the 18th green. His heart was
heavy, his shirt was soaked with sweat, and his face was reddened
more by embarrassment than the sun shining mercilessly down
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   He was a foot from carding a 77 and he gathered himself up yet
one more time, heaved a small sigh and tapped the ball into the
hole -- tough and professional to the bitter end.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no desire to be here, I promise you,'' he said
afterward. ''But I felt like this is what she wanted me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   No one but Nicklaus would have dared bring them up, but there
were a few compelling reasons for him to soldier on at Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   This was to be his last PGA Championship, over a course he
designed, paired for the first time ever in a competitive round
with the kid who has removed any lingering doubts about Nicklaus
ever finding a worthy successor. Teaching Tiger Woods a lesson was
not on that list, but it may turn out to be the best reason of them
all.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could tell that his mind really wasn't there initially,''
said Woods, who went on to shoot a 66 for a share of the
first-round lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''But once he got into the rhythm of playing, you can tell his
mind started getting more and more sharp and he started
concentrating more and more on every shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf had never seen anyone like Nicklaus when he burst onto the
scene four decades ago, but Woods' ascension over the last 15
months has dimmed even that memory. But the only way the kid makes
the eclipse total is to be as good as Nicklaus was for as long as
Nicklaus was. And if he looked deep enough into the old man's eyes
Thursday, he got a glimpse of just how daunting that is going to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus was married when he came out on tour during the 1961
season and Jack II, the oldest of his five kids, was born that
September. That means that he won when there was a growing family
at home making demands on his time and tugging at his heartstrings.
It means that he won despite flying back and forth from tournaments
to watch his kids' games, that he kept winning after burying the
most important influence in his life, his father, Charley, in 1970,
and won some more while trying to grow the Golden Bear brand into a
golf course design and equipment empire.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to put it is that Nicklaus has major championship
trophies older than Woods, and the 24 years before he bookended the
first with the last was the same number of years that the kid who
would be king has been alive.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Woods has only as many distractions as he wants, but
invariably the total will climb. He almost lost his father, Earl,
after a heart attack four years ago and when he recalled the night
he spent sleeping in a chair at his father's bedside in the
hospital, the confidence in his voice dropped an octave.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him, 'You know I want to be here with you.' He says,
'No, get your butt out there so I can watch you on TV. At least
I've got something to look forward to, because I've got tubes and
all this other stuff stuck in me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Woods went out the next morning in the second round of the Tour
Championship with no sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I shot like 9 over par on the front,'' he recalled.
The final tally was a 78. ''It was just a tough, tough round to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   There are going to be tough rounds in the future, the more the
longer Woods pursues Nicklaus down a path where precious few ever
tread. Few of those will be tougher than where Nicklaus walked
Thursday, mourning the woman whose stability provided the base from
which he climbed to the pinnacle of his profession.
</P>
<P>
   He honored that memory by playing yet again with every ounce of
concentration he could muster, with his second son, Steve, 37,
toting his bag. He marveled at Woods, employing weapons he never
had, playing a game even he is unfamiliar with, and tried at age 60
never to fall behind.
</P>
<P>
   What Nicklaus remembered at the end of that day was what scared
his mother most over the last year of her life -- that she would
pass away during one of golf's majors. Turns out she didn't have to
be afraid. Because of all the things Helen Nicklaus willed her son,
the last one turned out to be the strength to be Jack Nicklaus on
one of the toughest days of his life.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Downhill Course Ready, Fast  </HEADLINE>
By VANIA GRANDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   SNOWBASIN, Utah (AP) -- The 2002 downhill courses, possibly the
most technical in Olympic history, are ready for snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   From a 14,000-seat stadium, spectators will have a majestic view
of competitors slipping down a final chute, flying off a jump and
barreling through the finish line at up to 85 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be action from top to bottom,'' said Herwig
Demschar, Olympic director of alpine sports and former head coach
of the U.S. Women's Ski Team. ''They're going to be rocking.''
</P>
<P>
   The revamped hill will see its first test run Feb. 9-11 in a
Super Series downhill and super-G for the United State's top male
skiers and possibly some of Europe's Olympic contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were coaching (the Europeans), I would take three or four
of my key athletes and let them race,'' Demschar said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Memorizing every turn, jump and fall-away slope is crucial in
downhill, where racers reach blistering speeds and can be thrown
off balance by the slightest error.
</P>
<P>
   The men's World Cup tour will stop in Snowbasin on Feb. 24-25
for downhill and super-G races. Women will be racing at the resort,
10 miles east of Ogden, on March 16-18 in a Super Series downhill
and super-G.
</P>
<P>
   Demschar compared the final wall of Snowbasin's race hill to
that of Kitzbuhel, Austria -- a hair-raising World Cup downhill
considered the Super Bowl of skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a highly technical course,'' Demschar said of Snowbasin.
</P>
<P>
   Several sections at the top and bottom dip at a 75-degree angle.
Unlike Kitzbuhel, there is no flat, gliding section.
</P>
<P>
   The course is shorter than many others, Demschar said. Gliding
in a tuck position allows racers to rest some of their muscles. But
at Snowbasin, racers will stay on their ski edges.
</P>
<P>
   The women's course starts 180 yards below the men's, but both
are expected to take about 1 minute, 40 seconds to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers expect 25,000 spectators to show up for each of the
downhill races. Just as many are expected for the men's and women's
super-G and combined event, also at Snowbasin.
</P>
<P>
   Besides 14,000 seats in the U-shaped stadium, there will be
standing room for another 9,000-11,000 visitors. Organizers haven't
decided yet if they'll let spectators hike up or ski down to other
sections of the course.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-by-28-foot video screen at the finish line will show the
race from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the events, 70 miles of snowmaking pipes were
installed along with 540 computer guided snow guns and several
weather stations. Two timing devices also have been connected.
</P>
<P>
   A poor snow year forced Snowbasin to cancel several professional
races last year, but long range forecasts call for more snow and
cold this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've filled the trenches and ditches so even if it is a low
snow year it will be safe to run the races,'' Demschar said.
</P>
<P>
   Still in the works is a new day lodge, a ski service building,
200 to 300 parking lots, a dozen bus drop off loops, a food and
beverage area and a shorter access road saving 20 minutes of
driving time.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a tremendous new ski area coming out of the ground
here,'' said Jerry Anderson, managing director of venue development
for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee.

<HEADLINE> Honeywell announces sale of two businesses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Honeywell International Inc. on
Thursday announced plans to sell a friction materials unit and a
pharmaceutical chemical business, claiming the changes will
increase third-quarter earnings per share by 10 percent compared
with the third-quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Possible buyers for the two divisions have not been named.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the friction materials business includes Bendix,
based in Troy, Mich., and will affect about 5,600 employees. The
pharmaceutical chemical business, based in Morris Township, employs
about 1,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell anticipates earnings per share to be 76 cents,
excluding the effects of portfolio changes, matching the
expectations of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it expects charges associated with the sales of
the non-core businesses to range from $300 million to $350 million
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Tom Crane said Honeywell plans to sell other
businesses within the next six to nine months, but declined to name
them.
</P>
<P>
   Crane said the sales are expected to be completed by early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell stock rose 37.5 cents, or by 1 percent, to $34.813 at
the end of regular trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The company employs 120,000 people worldwide. It sells aerospace
products, power-generation systems, automotive products and
specialty chemicals.

<HEADLINE> Task Force Gets Tough On Racing  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Harness trainers, drivers and owners
support the New Jersey Racing Commission's decision to get tough on
the industry, a trade group spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission this week created a special task force to police
harness racing against drugged-up horses and unscrupulous workers --
a plan applauded by the industry, said Pat Salerno, executive
administrator of the Standardbred Breeders and Owners Association
of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way to get to the bottom is to get them to
investigate,'' Salerno said. ''I'd say 99 percent of the industry
is 100 percent honest, but there's always a small majority that's
questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Freehold-based trade group represents 2,500 horse trainers,
owners, breeders and drivers in the harness racing industry.
Harness racing is big business in New Jersey, with the Meadowlands
Race Track alone awarding more than $50 million in annual purses.
</P>
<P>
   But it's an industry that has also had its troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, a judge sentenced driver Richard Wojcio to five
years' probation, $7,500 in fines and 500 hours of community
service for conspiring to fix races at Freehold Raceway. He was
cleared of charges of fixing races.
</P>
<P>
   Wojcio won 405 races and more than $2.4 million in purse money
in 1995, the year before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Racing Commission Deputy Director Michael Vukcevich said the new
task force was created to prevent problems from worsening.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is purely a precautionary measure to make sure the
commission stays one step ahead of individuals who don't follow the
rules,'' Vukcevich said.
</P>
<P>
   One area that concerns the commission is the practice of some in
harness racing continuing to work in the field after they have lost
their licenses to suspension
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to create an awareness in the industry that such
action won't be tolerated. Not only do we want to punish
individuals but we want to create a deterrent effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vukcevich said the committee will also look into remarkable
changes in individual horses' performances, ''to confirm that there
is no illicit activity afoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel will also determine whether the commission's
laboratory is properly screening blood and urine samples from
horses. Under state law, the horses are not allowed to have any
foreign substances in their systems on race day.
</P>
<P>
   Industry regulators must quickly respond to the newest illegal
substances given to race horses to enhance their performance,
Vukcevich said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, about seven horses were stripped of their winnings
when a post-race test was positive, the state official said. That
was out of more than 800 tests given, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main point here is that the vast majority of people in
racing are fair and honest and what we have to do is make sure that
the playing field remains level,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Feds Say Laser Project Costs Soar  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Soaring development costs for the world's most
powerful laser could threaten a Clinton administration plan to
ensure the readiness of U.S. nuclear weapons in the absence of
actual testing, lawmakers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators reported that the laser project at
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory will cost more than $2.8
billion, nearly triple the original price from five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has told Congress the project will now
cost at least $2.2 billion, which is 50 percent higher than its
estimate only six months ago, according to a report by the General
Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   ''These new findings significantly heighten congressional
concerns about ... the viability of the stockpile stewardship
program,'' said Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The project is now expected to be completed in 2008, six years
later than the original target date.
</P>
<P>
   The laser, the most powerful and sophisticated ever built, has
192 laser beams focusing energy on a single target, allowing
nuclear scientists to simulate in a laboratory conditions in a
thermonuclear explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by super computers and other technology, nuclear weapons
scientists will be able to assure the reliability of America's
nuclear warheads without detonating nuclear devices. Nuclear bomb
testing was halted in 1992 with assurances that data needed to
assure weapon readiness eventually would be simulated in the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Madelyn Creedon, deputy administrator the DOE's nuclear weapons
agency, said that the laser project will ''go ahead as planned,''
but that its management team has been replaced and the DOE has
established a separate office to oversee the program. She said the
department would release firm cost figures next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The DOE has the job of maintaining the (nuclear weapons)
stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing ... and (the laser
project) is an integral part of the program,'' she said in a
conference call with reporters to discuss the GAO findings.
</P>
<P>
   The report by GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, concluded
that Lawrence Livermore has mismanaged the project, formally known
as the National Ignition Facility. The report also said that
technical problems, unexpected expenses and scheduling delays were
withheld from outside reviewers and the department.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairman of the House Science
Committee, which requested the report, said the cost escalation was
''alarming.'' He added, ''The fact that DOE's own independent
reviews masked the cost overruns is even more disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   The department learned only last summer that the laser program
was having problems, but officials have insisted that there are
major technical troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some lawmakers have questioned whether the program should
continue. An attempt to scuttle it fell short in the House this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Spence said the rising cost was ''extremely disquieting'' and
that the report ''raises legitimate questions about the ability of
the DOE's science-based approach'' as a substitute to nuclear
testing.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO attributed the cost overruns to an unrealistic original
budget, poor management at Lawrence Livermore and ''an absence of
effective independent reviews'' and department oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found that senior managers of the laser
project withheld their concerns about the technical and management
problems from the department and the director of the Livermore Lab,
which is operated by the University of California.

Royals-Twins:
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Closer Ricky Bottalico is day to day after injuring
a rib on his left side in the ninth inning Thursday. Bottalico
threw nine pitches in the ninth before coming out. ... Johnny
Damon, the first Royals player to score 100 runs in three straight
seasons, is on pace to score 136 times. That would eclipse Kansas
City's single-season record of 133, by Willie Wilson in 1980. ...
Damon's 3-for-5 performance Thursday extended his hitting streak to
12 games. ... Kansas City has 13 home runs in its last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: SS Cristian Guzman needs three triples to tie the AL
record of 21 by a switch hitter. Willie Wilson set the mark in 141
games in 1985. ... Pitching coach Dick Such is spending extra time
with ace Brad Radke, gone 1-2 with an 11.68 ERA in his last three
starts. Overall, the right-hander who signed a $36 million,
four-year contract extension this summer, is just 8-13 with a 4.72
ERA. ... LHP Mark Redman, the AL leader among rookies in victories,
strikeouts and ERA, said he's going to quit thinking about the AL
Rookie of the Year award because it's affecting him. He took the
loss Thursday, allowing four runs, seven hits and three walks in 4
1-3 innings.
White Sox-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Despite splitting the four-game series in Baltimore,
the White Sox have the best road record in baseball (39-26). ...
Magglio Ordonez went 0-for-4, ending an eight-game hitting streak,
but is 14-for-26 on the road trip. ... Tony Graffanino has hit
safely in 15 of his 19 starts. ... LF Carlos Lee had the only two
putouts that White Sox outfielders recorded. First baseman Paul
Konerko had 15 of the team's 24 putouts.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: The two runs Ryan Kohlmeier allowed in the ninth were
the first he'd given up since coming to the majors earlier this
month; he had thrown 9 2-3 scoreless innings before Thursday. ...
John Parrish threw 63 strikes and 61 balls in his 6 2-3 innings.
... Jeff Conine started in different positions in each of the four
games of the series: LF, DH, 1B and RF. ... SS Melvin Mora made
errors in all four games of the series.
Angels-Yankees:

<P>
   ANAHEIM: Anaheim began the day 20-19 against the AL East, after
going 20-36 last year. ... Angels have homered in 26 of 32 games
since the All-Star break, with a total of 45. ... Kent Mercker made
his second start since a cerebral hemorrhage on May 11. He went 3
2-3 innings Saturday, also against Denny Neagle and the Yankees.
... Darin Erstad hit his 20th homer Wednesday night at Toronto,
becoming the sixth player in franchise history to have 20 homers
and 20 stolen bases. Devon White (1987) was the previous to
accomplish the feat. Don Baylor (1977-79) and Bobby Bonds (30-30 in
1977) are the others. ... Ron Gant is hitting .269 (7-for-26) with
four home runs and six RBIs since joining the Angels. Four of his
last five hits have been homers, including three solo shots. ...
Troy Glaus hit his 35th homer Wednesday, most since Reggie Jackson
hit a club-record 39 in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Yankees began the night with 27-15 record since July
1, second in the majors to San Francisco (29-13). New York improved
from a three-game deficit in the AL East to a four-game lead during
the stretch. ... C Jorge Posada turned 29 Thursday. ... LHP Denny

<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers have lost their last six series against teams
from the AL East since sweeping Baltimore from May 18-21. On
Thursday, they opened a four-game series at Boston, second in the
AL East, before playing three games at the New York Yankees, the AL
East leader, on their two-city road trip. ... It didn't take Gabe
Kapler long to start hitting again. On Wednesday night, his 28-game
hitting streak, longest in the majors, ended when he went 0-for-4
against the Yankees. On Thursday night, he beat out a grounder into
the shortstop hole for a single in his first at-bat. ... Texas
entered the game with a dubious distinction. It had grounded into
117 double plays, most in the majors. Make that 118. Ricky Ledee
hit into one after Kapler's second-inning single off Tim Wakefield.
</P>

   BOSTON: It's official. The Red Sox said Pedro Martinez was their
probable starter for Saturday's game. He left Monday night's game
against Tampa Bay after four innings with a stiff right shoulder.
On Wednesday, he threw for 10 minutes and said he felt fine. The
major league ERA leader will face Texas' Matt Perisho. ... Nomar
Garciaparra is struggling through a 1-for-10 slump that has dropped
his AL-best batting average to .377 and dealt a severe blow to his
hopes of hitting .400, so Boston manager Jimy Williams kept him out
of the starting lineup. Texas starter Rick Helling had to be
pleased since Garciaparra was 12-for-26 in his career against him.
... 2B Mike Lansing got his first game off since he began playing
for the Red Sox after they obtained him from Colorado on July 27.
He was in uniform the next day but didn't play, then was in 17
straight games, batting .231. Jose Offerman started in his place.

a row in July. ... Todd Hollandsworth had two of the Rockies four
hits against the four Mets pitchers Thursday and is 7-for-32 (.219)
since being acquired by the Rockies July 31 from the Los Angeles

in the AL. ... Reliever Bobby Chouinard allowed home runs in both
his appearances in the series, one to Todd Zeile Tuesday night and
one to Robin Ventura on Thursday.

15 of the last 18 and have 43 home wins, the most in the majors.
... The Mets have won seven consecutive series since losing
two-of-three to Atlanta from July 21-23. ... Turk Wendell's six
strikeouts in relief of Mike Hampton was a career best (he struck
out five twice, most recently in 1995 for the Chicago Cubs). ...
Benny Agbayani's home run in the fifth inning was his 10th of the
season, giving the Mets seven hitters with 10 or more homers,
matching the club-record accomplished in 1986, 1987 and 1990. ...
Todd Zeile and Agbayani homered back-to-back in the fifth inning,
the 11th time this season the Mets have had successive batters
homer. ... Robin Ventura had sacrifice flies in his first two
at-bats, matching a Mets record (done several times, including last

in each of his first two at-bats. He tried again in the fifth and
was thrown out. ... Barry Bonds, who homered for the second
straight game, has 28 homers at Olympic Stadium, the most by an
opposing player and two more than Mike Schmidt. Including six
homers at Jarry Park, Schmidt hit a record 32 at Montreal.

12 of their last 13 home games. ... LF Peter Bergeron left
following the fourth with a bruised left thumb and was taken to a

<HEADLINE> Friedman To Start for Broncos  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- It has been a dizzying ride for Lennie Friedman
over the last 12 months, from a devastating knee injury that had
him thinking his brief career was over to moving into a starting
role -- if only temporarily -- on one of the NFL's best offensive
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, who has never played in a regular season NFL game, is
starting at left guard while Mark Schlereth recuperates from
arthroscopic knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   He started the first two preseason games for the Denver Broncos
this year, and will start again Saturday night against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It's a heady experience for a player who tore the anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee last year during training camp
of his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Really, it's his first year, getting hurt early in camp last
year,'' coach Mike Shanahan said. ''But he's been able to go to the
meetings and he played a little bit in the World League and was
able to get some experience there.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's done a really good job for a young guy coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran offensive tackle Tony Jones also has been impressed with
Friedman, but he won't tell him so. Jones is too busy giving
Friedman grief as part of the initiation process that all young
offensive linemen go through on this team.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been doing a good job,'' Jones said. ''He's been
improving every week he's been here. But I won't tell him that. I
never tell a young guy that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 300-pound Friedman, the Broncos' second-round
draft choice out of Duke, got a rude introduction into professional
football a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first got the report that I blew out my ACL, that's the
first thought that came to mind, that my career was over,''
Friedman said Thursday. ''But the coaching staff and Greek (trainer
Steve Antonopulos) explained to me that it's a common injury and
it's very easily fixed nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rehab was pretty tough, but it's supposed to be tough. That
way you can get back quicker and be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Recovered from his injury, he played for the Barcelona Dragons
of NFL Europe last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Being introduced as a starter at Mile High Stadium for the
Broncos' first home preseason game last week against Green Bay was
''absolutely one of the most exciting moments in my football
career. I was really excited and really energized to play the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, I'm happy with the progress I've made, but I also
know I have very far to go,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   He gets advice on a regular basis from Schlereth.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been terrific,'' Friedman said. ''He helps me with every
play. Every time I have questions, he's there. He's a terrific
player, and when he gets back I'm still going to ask him
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said his biggest adjustment to the NFL is ''the speed
of the game. Even coming over from NFL Europe, the game is so much
faster than anything I've seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, a psychology major in college, plans a career in
medicine once his playing career is over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always been interested in orthopedic surgery,'' he said.
''When my career is done, I'm definitely thinking about it. But
right now, I'm not thinking of anything but football. I have enough
on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that Broncos offensive guard Tommy Lyons attended medical
school while playing for the team from 1971-76, Friedman said,
''He's probably a better man than I am. I'm thinking of taking some
classes in the offseason, but not now.''

<HEADLINE> Teachers accused of paying bribes to college to cheat on tests  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL PAYNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - At least 52 teachers from five states
cheated on their competency tests by paying $1,000 bribes to exam
supervisors for extra time and help with the answers, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers from Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, Tennessee and
Arkansas are accused of taking part in the scheme at Philander
Smith College in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The test, required of teachers in 34 states to gain
certification, involves a four-hour general knowledge examination
and a survey of the candidate's subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a terrible violation,'' Mississippi Superintendent of
Education Richard Thompson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Philander Smith President Trudie Kibbe Reed said a former school
employee who worked for the college when the alleged violations
occurred in 1998 ran the testing scam.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a crime when the integrity of our institution is
compromised by one person's greed and lack of loyalty to the
mission of our campus,'' said Reed.
</P>
<P>
   The test is administered by New Jersey-based Educational Testing
Service. The nonprofit company said it began an investigation after
noticing questionable tests that may have involved fraud or
cheating. The service then turned over all evidence to the FBI in
Little Rock, which conducted a more lengthy investigation over the
course of a year.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers all have had their test scores canceled by the
testing service, said spokesman Kevin Gonzalez said. The service
said more teachers are expected to have their scores challenged
during the ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to education departments in the five states to decide
what happens to the teachers. The teachers could be fired or barred
from teaching again.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is expected to announce formal charges against ETS and
the college employee, Thompson said.

<HEADLINE> Neo-Nazis Remember Hitler Deputy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Right-wing extremists marked the anniversary of
the death of Hitler deputy Rudolf Hess by unfurling banners
Thursday, a day after the government approved $35 million to fight
racism.
</P>
<P>
   The banners and posters declaring ''Rudolf Hess, Martyr for
Peace,'' and similar slogans, were hung from bridges and buildings
in the eastern German communities of Dresden, Gotha and Rudolstadt,
as well as over a highway in western Hesse state, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, about 60 neo-Nazis marched through the city of
Rostock on the Baltic coast with burning torches, shouting ''Rudolf
Hess, our leader,'' according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they detained several people over incidents related
to the Hess anniversary. The officials did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   A Berlin court on Wednesday upheld city officials' decision to
deny a parade permit for Saturday to a neo-Nazi who wanted to mark
Hess' death. A court said that such a march would be ''unbearable''
for the general public in light of recent violence against
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a wave of neo-Nazi violence, the German Cabinet on
Wednesday approved $35 million in spending over three years to
support youth programs fighting racism, anti-Semitism and hatred of
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The government also will establish a nationwide hotline people
can use to alert police to ''drunken skinheads'' on the streets,
and has set up a $4.7 million fund to help victims of neo-Nazi
violence, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Ministry said the money would support projects that
try to integrate young people into careers and society and to
combat right-wing extremism.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, trade union and church leaders and other public
figures have led calls to prevent the kind of right-wing violence
against foreigners and the homeless that has left at least two
people dead this year.
</P>
<P>
   According to government statistics, 129 xenophobic offenses were
registered in June, 29 more than in the same month last year. That
included 28 violent right-wing attacks which left one person dead
and 26 injured.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary of Hess's death has become a rallying point for
right-wing extremists. He committed suicide in Berlin's Spandau
prison on Aug. 17, 1987. His family claims the 93-year-old Hess was
murdered.

<HEADLINE> Peru Opposition Leader Makes Claims  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Alejandro Toledo, repeating claims he was
denied Peru's presidency in a rigged election, is accusing
government forces of raiding his offices around the country and
hauling away computers full of political data.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who said he is preparing a ''parallel government with a
shadow cabinet'' in the capital Lima, said he talked informally
with President Clinton on Monday, the day the raids occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were robbed. I don't have the empirical evidence, but I
know without a doubt it was the intelligence services of the
Fujimori government,'' Toledo said in an interview Wednesday at the
Democratic National Convention. He has been attending the
convention with other foreign dignitaries as an observer.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said his party has backup data from the computers, but
simultaneous pre-dawn raids were staged on five offices around the
country and their computers stolen. A security guard was injured at
the Lima offices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the allegations Thursday, a congresswoman from
Fujimori's Peru 2000 party said the National Intelligence Service
has better things to do than ransack Toledo's offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Toledo is constantly making all sorts of allegations
against the Peruvian government, against the image of the Peruvian
government, against the image of Peru,'' Carmen Lozada said.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said the meeting with Clinton had not been scheduled, but
the president approached him at a Los Angeles luncheon where
Clinton spoke to foreign observers of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   According to Toledo, Clinton told him he has been closely
following his candidacy and the fight for democracy in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said thank you for participating in democracy and for
leading the democratic forces in Peru,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Security Council, David Stockwell,
said that while he could not specifically confirm the conversation,
it could have taken place during the luncheon and the description
acurately describes the president's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who Toledo said joined
the conversation, left Peru off her current Latin American trip.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who was in Argentina on Thursday, expressed concern at
the start of her trip about methods Fujimori used to win
re-election to a third consecutive term in a runoff vote that was
criticized by international monitors as flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who is credited with taming Peru's leftist rebels and
improving the economy, denies fraud in the election.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said he fully supports Organization of American States
(OAS) proposals for strengthening democracy in Peru, including
reforms in the judicial system, increased civilian control of the
military, and protection of human rights and freedom of expression
and the press.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen computers held names of opposition leaders and
information on the party structure, Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strategy is very similar of what Hitler used,'' he said.
''They want to hit me. They can't hit me directly, so they go to
people who are around me.'' He said the security forces took
advantage of his being out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo claims he won 51 percent of the presidential vote in a
May 29 runoff in May and should have been declared victor. He
boycotted a second runoff.
</P>
<P>
   In Lima, meanwhile, a poll by the independent Apoyo research
organization, found that Toledo's popularity may be fading. It
found his approval rating for Toledo at 26 percent, compared with
45 percent for Fujimori. The poll claims a margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who faces several charges in connection with violent
anti-government protests, said he would return to Lima after the
Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not leaving the country,'' he said. ''I'm not going to let
him have it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo accused Fujimori security forces of provoking the
violence in demonstrations against his July 28 inauguration.
Several government buildings were set ablaze, and six people died
in one fire at a government bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States has set up face-to-face
meetings between Fujimori government officials and the opposition
for next week.

<HEADLINE> Chavez May Seek 'Fast-Track' Powers  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA OLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Less than one week after a new
Congress opened, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Thursday he
may seek special powers that would allow him to sidestep the
legislature on key issues.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez asserted at a press conference that Congress may be too
bogged down with regulatory issues to attend to pressing problems
such as unemployment, land reform and the tax system.
</P>
<P>
   He said he might ask the legislature to grant him a fast-track
enabling law that would allow him to unilaterally push through his
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties have said they would not approve such a law
but leaders of Chavez's majority coalition have said they would
consider it. Chavez's allies have the three-fifths majority needed
to pass the law under the country's new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said the legislature can't deal with Venezuela's problems
quickly enough. ''That's why the law exists -- to face situations
like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the enabling law would undermine the new Congress's
authority. They say Chavez has run roughshod over the government's
separation of powers since becoming president in February 1999
promising a ''social revolution'' for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former paratrooper who staged a failed military coup
in 1992, governed without a democratically elected Congress for
nearly a year while the country awaited elections to confirm public
institutions as called for by a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez won a new six-year term during those elections, held July
30.
</P>
<P>
   ''To grant the president the enabling law would be to prolong a
state of transition and give an impression of a state of emergency
that we thought we had gotten past,'' opposition legislator Julio
Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez also criticized neighboring Guyana for what he said was
its increasingly aggressive attitude in a dispute over a
mineral-rich, 76,000 square mile territory that both countries
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is behind this? Why such an aggressive attitude from
Guyana?'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Guyana's Foreign Minister Clement Rohee was quoted as saying by
Venezuela's El Nacional newspaper Thursday that his country
wouldn't cede an inch of the Essequibo territory.

<HEADLINE> Leavitt: SLOC Should Pay Legal Fees  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT GEHRKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gov. Mike Leavitt says the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee should pay to defend Tom Welch and Dave
Johnson of fraud and bribery charges stemming from their role in
the Salt Lake Olympic bid.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt, who is vacationing in California, sent a note to his
representative on the SLOC Board of Trustees, Nolan Karras, early
Thursday outlining his position.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is still unclear if they broke the law. Only a court can
determine that,'' Leavitt wrote. ''Tom and Dave should be presumed
innocent of breaking the law while they prepare for trial. I think
SLOC should advance their legal fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson were hit earlier this month with a 15-count
indictment alleging they broke the law when they gave $1 million in
bribes and gifts to International Olympic Committee officials to
help land the 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have pleaded innocent to the charges and trial is set
for October.
</P>
<P>
   But since the men were acting in their official capacity as
Olympic representatives, their attorneys claim they are entitled to
have their legal costs paid for by SLOC under the committee's
bylaws.
</P>
<P>
   That could be costly, with both men planning to travel around
the globe to interview IOC members they are accused of bribing.
SLOC has already spent more than $1 million on scandal-related
attorney fees for Welch, Johnson and other Olympic officers.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC and the governor, who is a member of the SLOC Board of
Trustees, could also be forced to stand by the two men who have
been blamed for the Salt Lake scandal and threatened to embroil
other prominent Olympic figures.
</P>
<P>
   Should Welch and Johnson be convicted, however, they would be
obligated to repay the fees, Karras said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To say that this isn't a difficult issue would be far from the
truth,'' Karras said. ''They were our employees -- that is, SLOC
employees -- and if they didn't do anything illegal, we're supposed
to back them.''
</P>
<P>
   Karras said the conclusion seemed fairly obvious to the
governor, who did not take a long time to make his decision.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC's 51-member Board of Trustees is scheduled to take up the
attorney fee issue on Sept. 6, although that meeting may be moved
up to Aug. 25, to accommodate members traveling to the Summer
Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC president Mitt Romney is meeting with attorneys to help
form his opinion, according to SLOC spokeswoman Caroline Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mitt said, clearly the governor's view is very important to
the organizing committee and he would seek to understand the
governor's position from his representative,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said in his note that he presumed SLOC was pursuing
having its insurance company pick up some of the legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left for Johnson's attorney, Max Wheeler, and Welch's
Utah attorney, Michael Goldsmith, were not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> American Space Pioneer Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert R. Gilruth, a key engineer and
scientist in the American manned space program and the Apollo moon
missions, died Thursday. He was 86 and had Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Gilruth died at a long-term care facility in Charlottesville,
Va., the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer with the National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics, Gilruth led research into rocket-powered aircraft in
the 1940s and 1950s and helped to develop a rocket launch range at
Wallops Island, Va.
</P>
<P>
   When NASA was established in 1958, Gilruth led a team that
created the basic design for Project Mercury, the program that put
the first American in space.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Gilruth became the first director of the Manned
Spacecraft Center, now the Johnson Space Center, in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   During his 10 years a head of center, Gilruth directed 25 manned
space flights, including the first Mercury flight in 1961 and the
first Apollo moon landing in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Gilruth was in charge of the development and operation of the
Gemini spacecraft, a two-man craft used to perfect techniques for
the control, rendezvous and linking of spaceships in Earth orbit.
</P>
<P>
   He is credited with helping to conceive the method used to put
astronauts on the moon and return them safely to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of flying directly to the moon from Earth, Gilruth and
his team created a strategy of flying to an orbit around the moon
with a command ship and a lander linked together. The lander,
carrying two astronauts, then undocked from the command ship and
descended to the moon surface. Later, the moon explorers would
rocket back into lunar orbit and rejoin a crewmate aboard the
command ship for the trip back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Gilruth retired from NASA in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The late George Low, who served as director of NASA's manned
space flight program, once said of Gilruth: ''There is no question
that without Bob Gilruth there would not have been a Mercury,
Gemini or an Apollo program.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Goldin, the current NASA administrator, said in a
statement about Gilruth: ''His courage to explore the unknown, his
insistence on following strict scientific procedures, and his
technical expertise directly contributed to the ultimate success of
the Apollo program and the landing of a man on the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilruth was born in Nashwauk, Minn., and received degrees from
the University of Minnesota. He later was awarded honorary
doctorate degrees from at least five universities. Gilruth is
enshrined in the National Space Hall of Fame and received numerous
honors, including the President's Award for Distinguished Federal
Service and the prestigious Collier Trophy from the National
Aviation Club.
</P>
<P>
   Gilruth is survived by his wife, Georgene Evans Gilruth of
Charlottesville, a daughter and a stepson.
</P>
<P>
   The family plans no funeral or memorial service.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The San Francisco 49ers' problems don't stop.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coach Steve Mariucci suggested center Chris Dalman's neck injury
might be worse than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Dalman, a starter for the last four years, was hurt early last
week during a blocking drill at the team's training camp at the
University of the Pacific. He was caught among defensive tackle
Brenston Buckner, tackle Scott Gragg and another player when he
went down.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI exam showed disc damage, but it was hoped Dalman would
respond to treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci, however, indicated as the 49ers prepared to break camp
that Dalman's future was uncertain. Dalman was getting additional
medical opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to do the smart thing before he even thinks about
getting on the field,'' Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dalman's second neck injury. As a sophomore at Stanford,
he had fusion surgery on the third and fourth vertebrae
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said the team was approaching the situation cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're talking about the neck,'' he said. ''You're talking
about vertebrae''
Patriots:
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Chad Cascadden decided to retire after being plagued
by knee problems that cut short his 1999 season with the New York
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Cascadden, 28, signed with the Patriots on June 26 after being
released by the Jets on March 2 following his fifth NFL season. He
played sparingly in the Patriots' exhibition games, but did take
part in last Friday's 30-20 loss at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've talked to him a couple of times here since the Washington
game and he's not going to continue to play football this year or
anymore,'' said Patriots coach Bill Belichick, his defensive
coordinator in New York.
Rams:
</P>
<P>
   Running back Derek Loville, acquired from Denver on April 5 for
a sixth-round draft pick, was cut Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Loville was bothered early in camp by a hamstring injury. In two
exhibition games, he carried seven times for 18 yards and caught
two passes for 9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got some young guys that are coming on pretty good right
now, and it looks like Derek might be toward the end,'' coach Mike
Martz said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, first-round draft pick Trung Canidate's injured ankle
has improved to the point where he might play in next week's
preseason finale at Dallas. Originally, there was concern that
Canidate might not be ready until late September, missing three or
four regular-season games.
Giants:
</P>
<P>
   Running back Sean Bennett, an important part of New York's
multi-formation offense, has been told to have surgery on his right
knee that could end his season.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett intends to get a second opinion before making a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm unhappy. I want to play,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   The medial collateral ligament in the knee was injured on the
first play of the Giants' preseason opener against Chicago. Bennett
practiced at times the last two weeks, but the Giants had an MRI
exam performed this week.
Colts:
</P>
<P>
   Rookie cornerback Rodregis Brooks was placed on injured reserve
Thursday because of a bulging disc in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, a seventh-round pick from Alabama-Birmingham, missed two
days of practice last week with neck spasms. He practiced early
this week, but again missed the past two days when the spasms
returned.
Dolphins:
</P>
<P>
   Miami signed quarterback Gus Ornstein on Thursday, one day after
waiving Jim Druckenmiller.
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein spent part of training camp with Indianapolis before
being released Aug. 7. He went to camp with St. Louis as an
undrafted rookie free agent in 1999, but also was waived.
</P>
<P>
   He faces the same fate with the Dolphins. Ornstein will be
released next week when Jay Fiedler returns from arthroscopic hip
surgery, coach Dave Wannstedt said. Ornstein was needed to share
practice repetitions with Damon Huard and Mike Quinn.
Broncos:
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Kavika Pittman was fined $6,000 for a hit on Green
Bay quarterback Matt Hasselbeck in Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   On the play, as defensive tackle Trevor Pryce attempted to wrap
up Hasselbeck, Pittman lunged into the quarterback, a hit so strong
it knocked Hasselbeck's helmet off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I held up as much as I could in the situation,''
Pittman said. ''He was being tackled into my direction, and I was
already airborne with no direct-hit contact and no forearm to the
head. I hit him with my shoulder. So I don't feel like I should get
fined.''

<HEADLINE> Rockers 56, Liberty 43  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Rushia Brown scored 18 points and Cleveland's
defense clamped down on New York from the outset Thursday night,
sending the Rockers to a 56-43 victory over the Liberty in Game 1
of the WNBA's Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and her Rockers teammates seemed to surprise favored New
York, outhustling, outrebounding, outmuscling and outplaying the
East's regular-season champion from the opening tip.
</P>
<P>
   Susie McConnell Serio, who will retire when the season ends,
added 10 points and made two key 3-pointers as Cleveland won its
seventh straight home game before 11,686 fans at Gund Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of the best-of-thre series is Sunday night at Madison
Square Garden, where the Liberty have won 11 in a row. If New York,
which beat Cleveland twice in the regular season, has any plans of
getting to the league finals for the second straight year, it will
have to play better than this.
</P>
<P>
   Tari Phillips led the Liberty with 11 points, but none of her
teammates were much help.
</P>
<P>
   New York shot just 31 percent from the floor, and made just 8 of
30 shots after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Johnson, who averaged 12.3 points during the regular
season and 15 in the playoffs, had two points on 1-for-14 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's defense had a lot to do with New York's shooting
woes. The Rockers also outrebounded the Liberty 34-22.
</P>
<P>
   Leading by eight at halftime, the Rockers opened a 15-point lead
with 14:35 left on two straight layups by Chasity Melvin, who added
nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty got within nine, but Merlakia Jones and Brown scored
four points each in an 11-2 run that gave the Rockers their largest
lead, 52-34, with 3:38 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   New York only avoided its lowest point total of the season when
Marina Ferragut hit a 3-pointer with 31 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Defense dominated in the first half with neither team able to
get into any kind of offensive flow -- especially New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, barely challenged in winning their opening-round
series against Washington, found out early that Cleveland wasn't
the same team it had beaten twice in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers challenged every pass, effectively switched on
screens and made it tough for New York to get any open looks at the
basket. Liberty guard Teresa Weatherspoon was frustrated early,
complaining to officials about being fouled, and later in the half
New York's Becky Hammon pounded the scorer's table in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland led 16-13 when rookie guard Helen Darling came off the
bench and sparked the Rockers' 13-2 run over a five-minute span
that opened a 29-15 lead.

<HEADLINE> Golfers Wait at PGA Championships  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS DUNCAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- One hole into the PGA Championship, Ernie
Els had an idea of what to expect out of the round -- and it had
nothing to do with his score.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived on the tee of the par-5 2nd, three groups were
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   About six hours later, he finally walked off the course with a
2-over-par 74.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ridiculous,'' Els said. ''It takes one group early on to
have a bad hole and the whole field backs up.''
</P>
<P>
   Play was suspended by darkness at 8:27 p.m. Thursday with six
groups still on the course. The 18 players were spread out on Nos.
15, 16 and 18. They will complete their first rounds at 9:15 a.m.
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The second round will begin from the first tee, as scheduled, at
7:25 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   PGA senior director of tournaments Kerry Haigh said ''a high
percentage of groups'' were timed by officials after their rounds
had started, but none were assessed the two-stroke penalty that
follows two warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed in this pace of play,'' Haigh said. ''We
have a pace of play policy, that is certainly enforced and will be
again tomorrow. We expect things to run on schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Haigh said the PGA set a 4-hour, 41-minute limit for every group
to finish its round. Few made that deadline on Thursday. The
threesome of Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus and Vijay Singh played its
first round in 4:58, Haigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, who played with Els, blamed the delay on the four
par-5s at Valhalla, which are all reachable in two shots by most of
the players in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing can be done,'' said Watson, who shot a 76. ''Play was
delayed on the second tee, the 10th tee and the 18th tee. The
problem is the rough around these par-5s is so bad and the greens
are so tight, if you're struggling, it takes a long time for you to
play those holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Haigh also blamed the par-5s but said there were other factors
causing the delays.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every year at the PGA Championship, we are very limited with
the amount of daylight,'' Haigh said. ''Plus, the heat index is
taxing on everyone, the course is very difficult and it's major
championship conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those factors combine for a trying day.''
</P>
<P>
   Els suggested the PGA should think twice about coming back to
Valhalla, where the PGA was also played four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not criticizing the PGA, but they might have to rethink
playing this golf course,'' he said. ''You put 150 players on a
really tough course and try to finish in one day. You're not going
to do that on this track.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he could not remember playing in a major
championship where first-round play had to be suspended because of
slow play.
</P>
<P>
   ''That has to be the longest round I've played in a major
championship,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Els, Watson and Steve Jones were due to tee off at 9:22 a.m. on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's like it was today, we'll maybe play eight holes in the
morning and the rest of the round in the afternoon,'' Els said.
''I'm not looking forward to tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Leonard, playing in the group behind Els and Watson on
Thursday, teed off at 1:43 p.m. and finished as the sun was
setting, just before 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what the solution is,'' Leonard said. ''For
professional golfers to take six hours to play 18 holes, it's
pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I don't know enough about golf to know how to fix
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Lanny Wadkins summed it up best when he was asked if he
had time for a quick question after his round.
</P>
<P>
   ''Man, I don't have time for anything,'' Wadkins said, looking
at his watch. ''It's 7:15 p.m. We've been out here six hours. It's
ridiculous. On the senior tour, we take four hours in a cart and
sit down and have a beer.''

<HEADLINE> With BC-NJ--Flash Floods-Glance  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton declared flood-ravaged Morris and Sussex
counties disaster areas Thursday, making federal relief funds
available to help New Jerseyans repair their broken homes, bridges
and roads.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster declaration sought by Gov. Christie Whitman clears
the way for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up
offices in the area to help residents and towns and assess damages.
An office will be set up within the next few days, Whitman
spokeswoman Laura Otterbourg said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who suffered flood damage will be able to apply for
grants for temporary housing, home repairs or unemployment, or
low-interest loans for home repair. Small businesses can receive
low-interest loans of up to $1.5 million. FEMA funds will also be
available to pay for 75 percent of the cost of rebuilding bridges
and roads that washed away, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, who said she was ''relieved'' by the declaration,
announced the state would pay the remaining 25 percent of any FEMA
grants to replace public property and the remainder of some FEMA
grants that cover home repairs, destroyed personal property or
medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman spokesman Peter McDonough has said damage from the
storm, which dumped more than a foot of rain on some parts of the
two counties, will surpass $100 million. Sussex County officials
have estimated destroyed roads, bridges and homes in their county
alone will cost more than $166 million to repair, while Morris
County officials have an initial damage estimate of $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   The rain on Saturday and Monday, including 14 inches of rain
that fell in Sparta on Saturday, damaged thousands of homes, wiped
out dozens of bridges, roads and dams and forced hundreds to flee
the rising waters.
</P>
<P>
   Police continued a search in Hunterdon County Thursday for a
missing kayaker who went out on the swollen Musconetcong River.
Police found Charles Weaver's kayak on Wednesday about a mile
downstream from where he went missing but had not located the
58-year-old Riegelsville, Pa., man, Holland Township police said.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that floodwaters have produced breeding grounds for
mosquitoes and the West Nile virus, Sussex and Morris counties
stepped up its efforts to kill mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Morlock, administrator of health and public safety for
Sussex County, said six people have been treating stagnant water
harboring mosquito larvae with insecticides, particularly at dams
that burst in Sparta, Byram and Stanhope over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He said the mosquitoes breed in standing water, and the larvae
take 10 to 14 days to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ''We bomb them before they build their aircrafts,'' Morlock
said.
</P>
<P>
   County officials were treating water in Sparta with insecticides
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Morris County Mosquito Commission inspectors were out over the
weekend and on Thursday in Jefferson Township checking standing
water for mosquito larvae and treating it with pesticides,
superintendent Marc Slaff said.
</P>
<P>
   The potentially fatal, mosquito-borne virus killed seven people
in New York and sickened dozens last year. Three Staten Island
residents in New York have tested positive for the virus this year.
</P>
<P>
   Five dams under close watch in Sussex County haven't faltered,
State Police spokesman John Hagerty said. Ten bridges and several
roads remained closed in the county.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and business owners seeking assistance should call
1-800-462-9029 beginning Friday, between 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. seven
days a week. The reference number is 1337. Hearing- or
speech-impaired residents should call 1-800-462-7585.

<HEADLINE> Three killed in three-vehicle crash in Warren County  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KNOWLTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Three people were killed and
three others were injured Thursday when a car crossed the center
line on Route 46 and crashed into a tractor-trailer before spinning
and striking another vehicle, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The three people in the 1985 Ford Tempo that crossed the center
line and set off the collisions at 12:25 p.m. were pronounced dead
at the scene, according to Warren County prosecutors. The names of
the driver and two passengers in the Tempo were not released
pending notification of their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the tractor-trailer, Robin Hyry, 23, of Carlton,
Minn., was not injured, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The occupants of the third vehicle were identified as Jeanne
Olivo, 36, the driver, and her two passengers, Dorothy Carbone, 71,
and Angela Olivo, 8, all of Staten Island, N.Y. All three were
treated for minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey State Police and Warren County authorities are
conducting an investigation.

<HEADLINE> Frustrated unions threaten to abandon talks  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Talks aimed at settling a 12-day-old strike by
Verizon Communications workers headed for a crucial phase late
Thursday, as union bargainers threatened to walk out unless the
company presented an acceptable offer.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators said they would walk out at midnight unless they
reached an agreement or could report substantial progress in talks,
which began in late June.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the deadline, the company said it had
''fine-tuned'' its contract proposal, but would give no details.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had talked about wanting to see substantial progress, and
I think we are seeing substantial progress,'' said Verizon
spokesman Eric Rabe.
</P>
<P>
   Myles Calvey, negotiator for the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, said he did not know whether the updated
proposal would prompt the unions to talk past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   IBEW, the smaller of two unions staging the walkout, issued the
ultimatum late Wednesday. Negotiators representing the larger
Communications Workers of America seemed split about whether to
join in abandoning the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The IBEW represents 14,700 employees in New England and upstate
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The strike of 87,200 repair and customer service workers, which
began Aug. 6, affects 25 million Verizon consumers from Maine to
Virginia. Regular phone service is not affected, but the strike has
slowed directory assistance calls and requests for new service and
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon was formed by the June merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   CWA, which has two sets of bargainers, said at least one of the
two negotiating teams also planned to leave the talks at midnight.
They represent workers from New England and New York as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very possible'' that the other team, bargaining on behalf
of workers from New Jersey to Virginia, could set the same
ultimatum, said CWA spokesman Jeff Miller. The combined CWA
negotiators represent more than 72,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe of Verizon said Thursday afternoon that the threatened
walkout by union negotiators could give all parties greater
incentive to wrap up the protracted talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes it's helpful to have a deadline,'' he said. ''It
gets people focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabe noted that Verizon is one of the nation's few big
telecommunications companies with a substantial unionized work
force.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, we're the good guys from the standpoint of union
workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe said Verizon had about 100,000 pending requests for
repairs, about 20,000 more than a week ago and more than three
times the usual number of requests. Storm damage has added to the
repair load, Rabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, police in Baldwin, N.Y., said two striking
Verizon workers were in critical condition after cutting an
electric cable in an apparent attempt to sever a telephone line.
The men were charged with criminal tampering and criminal mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Police released details of a second incident on Long Island, in
which a striking employee was charged with reckless endangerment
for allegedly forcing a Bell Atlantic van off the Long Island
Expressway on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon has taken out full-page ads in several newspapers
explaining the dispute to customers. One ad, in Thursday's New York
Times, said of the strike, ''Nobody's winning. Not our company. Not
our customers. Not the union. Not our employees, the very people we
need to keep us competitive in the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike affects Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.

<HEADLINE> Australia Drifter Charged in Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUNDABERG, Australia (AP) -- A drifter was charged Friday with
murder in the deaths of two travelers who perished in a fire that
ripped through a backpackers' hostel in eastern Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Paul Long, 37, was also charged with arson in the June 23
blaze at the Palace Backpackers Hostel that killed 15 people.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not immediately say why Long was charged in the
deaths of only two of the victims -- 22 year-old Western Australian
twins, Kellie June Slarke and Stacey Louise Slarke.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not given a possible motive. One witness has said he
saw Long standing close to the hostel just before flames engulfed
the building.
</P>
<P>
   Long was staying at the hostel in the small town of Childers,
190 miles north of Queensland state capital Brisbane, the night the
aging timber building was torched.
</P>
<P>
   At his hearing Friday, Long -- a short, slightly built man with a
bushy beard -- sat with his hands shackled to a body belt in the
dock, surrounded by three security guards.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, Long's lawyer John Fraser said his client was
aware of the charges but did not say how his client would plead.
</P>
<P>
   Long was denied bail at the hearing in Bundaberg. His next
hearing was set for Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Long was arrested five days after the fire and charged at that
time with attempted murder for allegedly wounding a police officer
with a knife during his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The hostel was popular among backpackers seeking seasonal
fruit-picking work.
</P>
<P>
   Six backpackers from Britain, four from Australia, two from the
Netherlands and one each from Ireland, South Korea and Japan were
killed in the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the bodies were so burned they could only be identified
through dental records.

<HEADLINE> Tutu Returns To Rest in S. Africa  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a
leading activist in the struggle against apartheid, returned home
from a two-year sabbatical in the United States Thursday, saying he
planned to take a well-deserved rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so wonderful to be back -- it's enough to move one to
tears,'' he told reporters after arriving at Cape Town's airport.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, who underwent surgery for prostate cancer in November last
year, said his recovery had been slower than expected and pledged
to maintain a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to come home to sleep. We have a cadre of outstanding
new leaders. We oldies, certainly I, should give them space to show
off their worth,'' he said. ''It is now time I move away from
center stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The 69-year-old Anglican archbishop, who won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1984 for his role in fighting white rule which ended with
all-race election in 1994, subsequently chaired a commission which
probed apartheid-era abuses and gave amnesty to those who confessed
of their involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu said the government and those who benefitted from apartheid
had a duty to pay reparations to people identified by the
commission as victims of the evil system.
</P>
<P>
   The jovial archbishop is widely revered and loved in South
Africa, with his personable manner endearing him to people across
the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, who was lecturing theology at Emory University in Atlanta,
showed his manner had not changed while he was away from South
Africa. He went down on his knee to tie a photographer's shoelace
and enthusiastically embraced supporters who had arrived to welcome
him home.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - It's a mantra familiar to baseball teams of all
ages: Wait 'till next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rolando Paulino All Stars from the Bronx lost 1-0 Thursday
night to the Goffstown, N.H. team in the Eastern Regional Little
League title. The New Hampshire team will go on to the Little
League World Series, which begins Sunday in Williamsport, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Three busloads of parents and fans made the 2&AMP;frac12;-hour drive to
Connecticut to cheer the team of 9-to-12-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the team's main supporters, Bronx Borough President
Fernando Ferrer, missed the game because he was attending the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But the borough president sent a telegram wishing the team luck
and promised to call youngsters after the game, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ''The spirited and dynamic Rolando Paulino All-Stars are an
inspiration to all the residents of the Bronx,'' Ferrer said.
''They persevered against tough opponents, and in doing so they
have made us all proud.''

<HEADLINE> 38 Kurds Said Killed in Iraq  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP)-- Turkish warplanes have killed 38 civilians in
a strike on a camp of Kurdish herdsmen in Iraq, an Iraqi Kurdish
group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman in Turkey's capital Ankara denied the
allegation, saying that Turkish planes would not attack civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The planes attacked a camp of herdsmen and their families while
pursuing Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, the Kurdistan Democratic
Party, or KDP, said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has waged a 15-year war against Kurdish guerrillas who
are demanding autonomy in southern Turkey, which borders on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The KDP statement wasn't clear on exactly when the attack
occurred, indicating it was either on Tuesday or Wednesday. The
group couldn't be reached for a clarification.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also said that 11 people were wounded in the
alleged raid and four were missing.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots had intended to strike targets of the Kurdistan
Workers Party or PKK in the northeastern border region of Iraq, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The PKK declared a cease-fire early this year and the rebels
began retreating from Turkey to bases in Iraq and Iran. The Turkish
armed forces did not recognize the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, KDP forces have assisted the Turkish military in
operations against the PKK inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The KDP and the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan control the
Kurdish zone of northern Iraq, an area whose autonomy has been
protected by U.S. and British planes since Iraqi government forces
brutally put down a Kurdish revolt there in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Bradstreet portrait tops auction at $40,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLIFTON PARK, N.Y. (AP) - A 240-year-old portrait of a prominent
Colonial general fetched $40,000 Thursday night at an auction of
items discovered this year upon the death of an area woman.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the auction, the only known existing portrait
of Gen. John Bradstreet, sold to William Reese, a collector from
New Haven, Conn. In the portrait by Thomas Mc ilworth, Bradstreet,
a veteran of the French and Indian War, sits stiffly without
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Carter, of Acorn Auction and Estates, said the price
was eight times higher than the previous sale topper for a painting
by Mc ilworth, perhaps driven by an increasing understanding of

sold and the auction house ''got top dollar for the majority of the

   ''We had (bidders) represented from all over the country,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other items recovered earlier this year included letters to

President Johnson's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Burr was a vice president and the man who killed Alexander
Hamilton. Key wrote the ''Star Spangled Banner.''

   And, like her step-grandfather, the auction prices for the

   ''Our belief about Martha was vindicated,'' Carter said. ''She
was perceived as a more important character than previously
believed.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Governor Plans Abortion Poll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The governor of Guanajuato state says he will
let the people decide whether he should approve or veto a highly
controversial proposal to criminalize abortion in the case of rape.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Ramon Martin Huerta said he would contract an outside
polling firm to survey citizens before making his own executive
decision on the bill the state legislature approved earlier this
month, the Reforma newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm putting this before the citizenry and will abide by what
they say,'' said Martin Huerta, who has declined to offer a public
opinion on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Guanajuato legislators from the conservative National Action
Party of President-elect Vicente Fox passed the bill on Aug. 3,
igniting a nationwide debate over the issue and raising fears about
the party's conservative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The move also prompted Mexico City's leftist mayor to submit her
own proposal that would decriminalize abortion when the life of the
mother is threatened or when the fetus has severe birth defects.
That proposal must be approved by the federal district's
legislature, a majority of which reportedly is leaning toward
supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Mexico City law allows abortions in the case of rape.
</P>
<P>
   In most of Mexico's 31 states, abortion is allowed in cases of
rape or when the life of the mother or the baby is in danger. In
other cases, abortion is illegal, punishable by one to five years
in jail for the mother and 10 for the doctor who performs it.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, struggling to bury historical fears of his party's socially
conservative stance, has said he would not support a
Guanajuato-style initiative at the federal level.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Continue at Convention  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTINE HANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- About 2,500 activists poured into the streets
Thursday for the last day of the Democratic convention, protesting
environmental destruction and greeting Al Gore's big speech with a
chorus of chants and drum beats outside the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the people demonstrated peacefully inside a
fenced protest area. But about 200 protesters, apparently preparing
for trouble, faced off against police across a chain-link fence.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators passed out vinegar and soaked it on bandannas
to fend off the effects of pepper spray. Others donned gas masks.
</P>
<P>
   A handful marched toward the police with red and black flags,
followed by dozens of others. Police stood feet away, armed with
guns that shoot pepper spray and beanbags.
</P>
<P>
   One protester held a sign that read, ''Beat me blue.'' Another's
sign read, ''Beat me, sue you.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff came after demonstrators had urged the crowd not to
get out of hand because some of the protesters were on parole or
were undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest rally bringing hundreds of demonstrators to the
downtown garment district to protest sweatshops and call for better
wages and health benefits for apparel workers.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in the garment district watched from windows of sewing
shops, waving to the demonstrators and shaking their fists in the
air in support. The activists, many of them Hispanics who say
immigrants are often the victims of unfair labor practices, danced
in the street and sang Latin songs while marching to the Staples
Center convention hall under a heavy police presence.
</P>
<P>
   In other protests:
</P>
<P>
   -- About 200 demonstrators rallied in front of the downtown
federal building to protest training exercises on a U.S. Navy
bombing range on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. Toting signs,
burning incense, banging drums and shaking rattles, protesters
marched in a circle and chanted ''no more bombs'' in Spanish and
English.
</P>
<P>
   -- At Pershing Square, a gathering place for demonstrators this
week, about 100 activists criticized Citibank for funding projects
they said were ruining the environment. The ''Spank the Bank''
protest moved about two blocks to Citibank Center downtown and
returned without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boycott Citigroup, the world's most destructive bank,'' read
stickers protesters pasted downtown.
</P>
<P>
   -- Environmental activists rallied in Century City, an area west
of downtown where Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore was
staying, and called for protection of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Save it, don't pave it,'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   The peaceful protests came a day after bottle-throwing
protesters and baton-wielding police clashed briefly outside the
Staples Center arena.
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday, police had made 192 convention-related
arrests, the bulk of them for misdemeanor violations.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office charged two protesters with
felony vandalism Thursday, but said 40 others arrested during an
animal rights protest near the site of the Democratic National
Convention were released.

Gore Accepts Democratic Presidential Nomination

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore launched his fall quest for the White House
Thursday, pledging a ''better, fairer, more prosperous America'' in the
climactic speech of the Democratic National Convention. Acknowledging ''my own
imperfections'' he said nonetheless, ''I stand here tonight as my own man,''
after eight years as vice president. In the final minutes of his convention,
Gore entered the hall to a thunderous ovation. ''In the name of all the working
families who are the strength and soul of America,'' he said, ''I accept your

nomination was formally ratified tonight, Lieberman held a flurry of private
meetings with leaders of labor, women's groups and teachers' organizations. His
slogan for the day: ''Winning is the whole deal.'' Later, with a single mighty
shout, delegates to the Democratic National Convention snapped a long-standing
assumed religious barrier by nominating Lieberman.

New Grand Jury To Hear Lewinsky Case

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray has empaneled a new grand

as he tries to determine if criminal charges are warranted, legal sources said
today, and the news angered Democrats on the night Vice President Al Gore was to
accept the party's presidential nomination at its convention in Los Angeles.
''It's probably just another Republican dirty trick,'' Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., said. The move follows through on Ray's promise to consider whether the
president should be indicted after he steps down from office next January. Legal
experts cautioned the decision doesn't mean charges will ever be filed.

<HEADLINE> Gore Trying To Connect to Voters  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Famously wooden, Al Gore never claimed he was
Mr. Personality. He tried to connect with voters Thursday night
using a homespun biography and a thick briefcase of ideas about
Social Security, better schools, a patients' bill of rights and
much, much more.
</P>
<P>
   The goal: to persuade Americans he can be just as likable as
George W. Bush -- but has a lot more experience and substance.
Friends and family lined up on the final night of the Democratic
National Convention to humanize Gore's image with stories of his
determination, humor, spontaneity and decision making.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problem, though, is that he's been struggling for well
over a year to introduce -- and reintroduce -- himself to voters. To
define and redefine himself. Eight years the understudy, he has
been overshadowed by President Clinton and denied credit for the
nation's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand here tonight as my own man and I want you to know me
for who I truly am,'' Gore said. He raced over applause in his
51-minute address to keep on speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that sometimes people say I'm too serious, that I talk
too much substance and policy,'' Gore acknowledged. ''Maybe I've
done that tonight. But the presidency is more than a popularity
contest. It's a day-by-day fight for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bush, Gore had some unwelcome distractions in Los
Angeles. There were arguments over a Playboy mansion fund-raiser
and news of a fresh grand jury investigation of Clinton. Gore
running mate Joseph Lieberman had to spend time mending fences with
blacks and others, underscoring splits within the Democratic ranks.
</P>
<P>
   One of Gore's biggest hurdles, reflected in the polls, is that
at least four of 10 Americans don't like him, won't vote for him
and haven't shown much inclination to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll this week suggested
Gore may be starting to chip away at those numbers during his
convention. But Bush is liked by twice as many voters as those who
dislike him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats don't hate Bush as much as Republicans hate Gore,''
said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something off-putting about the guy,'' said Jim Duffy,
a Democratic consultant who worked with Gore in his failed
presidential campaign in 1988. ''He just hasn't been able to
connect with people the same way Clinton does or even Bush is able
to do. He's not a good people politician. He's a much more cerebral
politician.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also has been hurt by voters' weariness over
the long political saga involving Clinton's affair with Monica
Lewinsky -- an episode that came back again on the very day Gore
accepted his party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Legal sources said Independent Counsel Robert Ray had empaneled
a new grand jury to hear evidence against Clinton. The White House
complained that the timing of the leak ''reeks to high heavens.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush managed to project a lot of confidence at his convention.
He could exult that Republicans were united. But there was a lot of
nail biting among Democrats in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden of Delaware said, ''There's a lot of
anxiety hanging over this convention'' because Democrats ''can't
understand how a guy like George W. Bush can be leading a guy with
the kind of caliber, experience and know-how as Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta said Bush was benefiting
from America's desire ''for a dynamic candidate'' who can bring
change.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Gore adviser said the Democratic convention hadn't gone
as planned. The first two days were ''a little ragged'' and that
raised the stakes for Gore's speech Thursday night, the adviser
said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Clinton's convention speech dragged past 11 p.m.
EDT when a huge part of the television audience was lost. There
also was second guessing about Lieberman's remarks about mending
affirmative action, comments that reinforced an emerging story line
alleging political flip-flops. Democrats had to devote Tuesday
night to trying to solidify the party's base of core voters.
</P>
<P>
   Merle Black, professor of politics at Emory University, said
Gore's real challenge is project himself as a likable politician
whom voters want to root for.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush had that going for him in Philadelphia,'' Black said.
''He came across in his speech as a likable person. He got stronger
as he went through the speech. A lot of Americans could buy into
that because they liked him, hoped it works out that kind of way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Oppenheimer, political scientist at Vanderbilt University,
said Gore should highlight his skills and not worry about
comparisons with Clinton or Bush. ''If you try to do what you can't
do, then you're Mike Dukakis riding in a tank,'' Oppenheimer said.
''So be yourself.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 8, Rangers 7  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Mike Lansing's second two-run double in two
innings capped a three-run rally in the ninth that gave the Boston
Red Sox an 8-7 win over the Texas Rangers on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing, whose 15 hits for the Red Sox before Thursday were all
singles, didn't start for the first time in 18 games since he was
acquired from Colorado on July 27.
</P>
<P>
   With Boston trailing 6-2, he pinch hit for Brian Daubach in the
eighth and doubled in two runs, then scored as Troy O'Leary's
infield single to first was thrown wildly for an error by Rafael
Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Then Texas made it 7-5 on Rusty Greer's third double of the game
in the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox didn't seem to have much of a chance. They had
stranded 13 runners, including men in scoring position in each of
the first seven innings, and John Wetteland, who had 26 saves in 33
opportunities, came in to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But he ran into trouble with two outs when Scott Hatteberg
walked and Jose Offerman singled to right.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gilkey hit a routine grounder to shortstop, but Royce
Clayton had trouble getting the ball out of his glove, and Gilkey
reached on the error, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox already had left the bases loaded in the second and
seventh innings, but they didn't waste this chance.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland (4-5) hit Carl Everett, who had struck out in his
previous three at-bats, cutting the lead to 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing then lined a 1-and-1 pitch off the left-field wall for
Boston's 18th hit, driving in the decisive runs and sending his
teammates racing out of the dugout to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Garces (8-0) allowed one run in one inning on consecutive
doubles by Frank Catalanotto and Greer as Boston remained four
games behind the AL East-leading New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the Red Sox had come from behind with a
three-run eighth inning that gave them a 4-3 win over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Greer and Catalanotto drove in three runs each for the Rangers,
who had taken a 3-1 lead on Catalanotto's two-run homer in the
third and Bill Haselman's solo shot in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Texas added three runs in the seventh, one on a wild throw to
second on a potential double-play grounder to Tim Wakefield and two
on Greer's double.
</P>
<P>
   Boston scored in the seventh on O'Leary's 10th homer and added
three in the eighth against Jeff Zimmerman and Mike Venafro.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored their first run off Rick Helling on Carl
Everett's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Helling-Wakefield matchup was a replay of last
Saturday's pairing in Texas, won by the Rangers 6-3. ... Lou
Merloni is 9-for-16 in four games since being called up from
Triple-A Pawtucket on Monday. He went 3-for-5 Thursday. ... Gabe
Kapler went 1-for-5 for Texas, one day after his 28-game hitting
streak, longest in the majors this season, ended. ... Helling threw
118 pitches, increasing his AL-high total to 3,047.

   BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) -- Pitcher Ben Collins scored the game's only
run and outdueled Juan Almonte as New Hampshire beat New York 1-0
in extra innings Thursday night to win the Eastern Regional title
and advance to the Little League World series.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who struck out 11 and walked two, drew a walk to open
the seventh. He scored all the way from first base when the New
York defense misplayed Jarek Ostrowski's single to right.
</P>
<P>
   ''They took a big gamble, and that won the ballgame for them,''
said Alberbo Gonzalez, manager of the Bronx team.
</P>
<P>
   Collins kept running as the ball was mishandled in right by
Victor Tores. Tores then threw to third base, but Collins scored
easily when Jesus Hernandez couldn't handle the throw.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way this game was being played, it would come down to one
play and that was our only real opportunity,'' said Frank Szumiesz,
manager of the Goffstown, N.H., team.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the seventh, New York had two runners on base,
but Collins struck out Pedro Guzman to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Almonte, who also struck out 11, finished with a two-hitter in
pitching a complete game. He did not allow a hit until the sixth
when Jonathan Berube singled with one out.
</P>

   Goffstown is the first team from New Hampshire to reach the
World Series since Bedford accomplished the feat in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Albright Visits Argentina Bomb Site  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright toured the site of a 1994 bombing attack on a Jewish
community center Thursday, showing solidarity with Washington's
allies in the fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who is on a five-nation tour of South America, joined
Foreign Minister Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini and Jewish leaders
to pay homage to the 86 victims in a solemn visit to the rebuilt

   Albright later traveled to Santiago, Chile, where she promised
that the United States would continue to declassify documents
related to the 1973-1990 dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. She
noted that after massive disclosures in June and September 1999,
some 11,000 additional documents are earmarked for declassification
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The documents refer to relations between the United States and
Chile under Pinochet, including information on some cases of human
rights violations here.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference in the Chilean capital, the secretary
also touted a U.S. program to promote peace and battle drugs in
Colombia, saying she has received strong support from other nations
for the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said reports that Brazil was cool to the multi-million
dollar ''Colombia Plan'' were wrong. She stressed she was not
requesting financial backing for the plan in the countries she is
visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with Albright, Chilean Foreign Minister Soledad Alvear
said Chile ''strongly supports the plan'' as a move in defense of
the elected democratic government of Colombian Presiden Andres
Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration plan calls for a U.S. commitment of
$1.3 billion and $621 million from other nations for beleaguered
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, Albright stood on the patio of the fortress-like
building Jewish center, beside a monument emblazoned with the Star
of David and a stone plaque etched with the word ''REMEMBER'' and
the names of the victims of the July 18, 1994, attack.
</P>
<P>
   Although Albright did not comment in public, a senior State
Department official said the secretary wanted to show solidarity
with the victims in her last appearance of a two-day visit to
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is to show solidarity with Argentina for its strong
support of efforts to fight terrorism, both through the
Organization of American States and through other forums,'' said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Little progress has been made in arresting the masterminds of
either the bombing of the Jewish center or the 1992 bombing of the
Israeli Embassy that killed 22 people. The bombings shook
Argentina's 220,000-member Jewish community, the largest in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the new eight-story Jewish center was inaugurated,
complete with double metal doors and concrete walls. Photographs of
the first center, which was destroyed, hang in a ground-floor
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion has fallen on 15 former police officers in the Jewish
center bombing. Prosecutors say most had accessory roles such as
procuring the car used in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando De la Rua took office in December and pledged
to make the bombing investigations a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have complained that investigators under former
president Carlos Menem weren't thorough.
</P>
<P>
   ''We welcome this meeting,'' said Rogelio Cichowolsky, president
of the Delegation of Jewish Associations, after Albright sat down
with Jewish leaders to discuss the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   They also spoke about an estimated 2,000 Jewish victims missing
under Argentina's 1976-83 military dictatorship and the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very important that Albright came today because the
families of the victims specifically asked for U.S. help in
investigating this case,'' said Sofia Guterman, whose only child,
Andrea, 28, was killed in the Jewish center attack.
</P>
<P>
   She regularly joins relatives of other victims to light candles
and call for justice.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Albright's visit to the site would focus attention on
the case, she said: ''Yes, absolutely.''

<HEADLINE> Comets 77, Sparks 56  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Sheryl Swoopes scored 22 points and Cynthia
Cooper added 21, and the Houston Comets used a 17-0 run to take
control in a 77-56 victory over Los Angeles on Thursday night in
Game 1 of the WNBA's Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of the best-of-three series is Sunday in Los Angeles. A
third game, if necessary, would be in Los Angeles on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks, with the best record in the WNBA this season at
28-4, beat the Comets all three time they played in the regular
season but the Comets, three-time WNBA champions, were ready this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, the two-time league MVP, and Swoopes, honored Thursday
as this season's MVP, took control early as Houston overpowered the
Sparks with the early 17-0 run that made it 19-4.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, held to 16 points in Monday's playoff game against
Sacramento, and Tina Thompson each had six points in the run.
Cooper had 15 points and Swoopes 10 in the first half as Houston
built a 17-point lead at 40-23.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks self-destructed in the first half with 16 turnovers
that the Comets turned into 25 points. Houston had eight first-half
turnovers, yielding seven points. Los Angeles had 25 turnovers for
the game, costing them 37 points.
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika led the Sparks, hitting seven 3-pointers for 21
points. Lisa Leslie had 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles shot 29 percent from the field in the first half and
didn't have a player in double figures. The Sparks shot 36 percent
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Play was hard, but tempers didn't flare the way they did in last
year's conference playoff between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie and Thompson were ejected in last season's Western
Conference finals. Leslie was fined $500 for shoving Thompson and
Thompson got a $300 fine for taunting.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NBA Player Pleads Guilty in Ariz  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Former NBA guard Sedale Threatt pleaded
guilty this week to a misdemeanor charge of criminal damage
stemming from a fight with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Threatt was accused of throwing a mirror at his wife during a
March argument. He also was accused of lobbing a steel trash can
across the living room of their home and breaking down the door to
their bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to two years' unsupervised probation and was
ordered to pay $464 in fines and court costs. He also must attend
an alcohol screening and domestic nonviolence program.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, Threatt, who played in the NBA from 1983-97 for
Philadelphia, Chicago, Seattle, Houston and the Los Angeles Lakers,
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor federal charge of failing to pay
child support. In April, he paid nearly $172,000 in child support
for six of his children as part of a pretrial release agreement.

<HEADLINE> Trainer, Jockey Winning Combination  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUIDOSO DOWNS, N.M. (AP) -- Trainer Jack Brooks and jockey Jacky
Martin, who for years were a formidable team in quarter horse
racing, reunited Thursday and have the top qualifier for next
month's 42nd running of the All American Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   Eyesa Special was clocked in 21.526 seconds in winning his
trial, the fastest time among the 10 horses that qualified for the
$2.4 million All American.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen trial races were run Thursday to determine the
futurity field, where the winner of the 440-yard sprint on Labor
Day earns $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and Martin combined to win six All Americans, the last in
1992 with Dash Thru Traffic. After they split up, Brooks won a
seventh All American with the filly Falling In Loveagain in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the best rider going,'' Brooks said of Martin. ''With
Jacky, I have so much confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyesa Special, making only his third start, won the fifth trial
by 1&AMP;frac12; lengths, taking advantage of a 5 mph tailwind to record the
best time of the day.
</P>
<P>
   A rainstorm hit Ruidoso Downs just before the fifth race and
most of the final nine races were run into a headwind. Only one
horse, Eye On Paydirt, qualified after the eighth race. Eye On
Paydirt, a gelding, got into the final spot in the top 10 with a
time of 21.925 in the 15th trial.
</P>
<P>
   Fashionisanattitude, one of four fillies in the finals, had the
second fastest time of 21.690. However, she bled after crossing the
finish line and was taken off the track in a van. Her status for
the futurity was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of 11 horses paid a $50,000 supplemental fee to get
them into the trials, but only one -- Copper Buff -- made it to the
finals. Copper Buff, winner of four of six races this summer, won
the eighth trial in 21.787, the fourth fastest time of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks also saddled another qualifier in Blazen Maven, a filly
who had the seventh fastest time of 21.873.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the qualifiers were: First Down N Surfin (21.740);
Ima Royal Winner (21.805); Whosleavingwho (21.828); Beccas Quick
Six (21.908) and Toughest Test (21.921).

<HEADLINE> Plot To Kill Milosevic Denied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Four Dutch citizens arrested for
allegedly plotting to kill President Slobodan Milosevic have
vehemently denied the accusation, their lawyers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''All four have expressly and explicitly denied charges against
them,'' Ivan Jankovic, a Belgrade lawyer defending one of the men,
said after his first meeting with his client at Belgrade's central
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is my belief that their earlier statements, including the
one on video, have been forced out of them by force, by threats or
false promises,'' Jankovic added, referring to a footage broadcast
by a Yugoslav official showing the men in military uniforms and
confessing into camera.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovic did not explain further.
</P>
<P>
   The four Dutchmen -- Jeroen van Lersel, Bas van Schaik, Sander
Zeitsen and Godfrid de Rie -- were arrested last month on suspicion
of plotting to kill Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   They were sentenced Friday to 30 days in jail for illegally
entering the country, Dutch officials said, but remained under
investigation and will probably face further charges.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovic said his client, de Rie, was ''mildly depressed and
constantly talked about his innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other defense lawyers rejected as untrue an earlier
statement from a Yugoslav official that the group had been after a
$30 million bounty for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Yugoslav Information Minister Goran Matic
said that the men were detained in July attempting to enter Kosovo,
Serbia's southern province, from Montenegro, the junior partner in
the two-state federation.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the minister showed footage allegedly taken during
interrogation of the four, dressed in military uniforms, with one
of them admitting on tape to wanting to abduct Milosevic or former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and turn them over to the U.N.
war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The video also showed maps, pocket tools, knifes and cameras
allegedly used by the Dutch. Another unidentified captive told the
camera that in case the abduction of Milosevic failed, one of them
''had the idea to kill the president, to decapitate his head, to
put it in the box and to send it home'' to the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The four Dutchmen are not the only foreigners recently arrested
on suspicion of terrorism -- two Canadians and two Britons are
imprisoned by the Yugoslav army, awaiting the military prosecutor's
decision whether to charge them.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner, who currently
holds the roating presidency of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe called on Yugoslav officials to release the
prisoners immediately.

<HEADLINE> Gore Accepts Democratic Nomination  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore charged like a star quarterback
through a gantlet of roaring fans Thursday night to claim the
Democratic presidential nomination. On center stage at last, the
eight-year apprentice offered a self-portrait of a studious fighter
for America.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I won't always be the most exciting politician. But I
pledge to you tonight: I will work for you every day and I will
never let you down,'' the vice president said in the finale to his
party's four-day national convention.
</P>
<P>
   The convention hall was awash in blue-and-white Gore pennants
and flags. Gore waded through the thousands of delegates --
barrel-chested in an open suit coat, both arms upraised, slapping
high fives. Reaching the podium, he swept his wife, Tipper, into a
dipping embrace and planted a long kiss on her lips.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates shouted ''Go Al go!'' as, in a 51-minute speech he
insisted he wrote himself, their choice for president touched on
their favorite issues, from campaign finance reform to education.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Gore and his family were joined by running mate Joe
Lieberman and his family, as metallic confetti and balloons rained
down.
</P>
<P>
   Gore consistently trails in the polls against a Republican
rival, George W. Bush, whom even Gore has called charming. Even as
he drew adulation from a hall packed with adoring Democrats, Gore
acknowledged up front his dry reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know my own imperfections. I know that sometimes people say
I'm too serious, that I talk too much substance and policy. Maybe
I've done that tonight. But the presidency is more than a
popularity contest. It's a day-by-day fight for people. Sometimes,
you have to choose to do what's difficult or unpopular,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has struggled to outrun President Clinton's shadow
since launching this campaign 14 months ago, told voters: ''We're
entering a new time. We're electing a new president.''
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned the president by name just once, calling him a
partner and giving him credit for moving the country into the
longest period of economic expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's widowed mother, Pauline, 87, blew him a kiss as the
senator's son claimed the prize that eluded the senior Sen. Albert
Gore, who died in 1998, and the younger when he ran in 1988. She
presided in a sky box, with Tipper Gore and their four children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used the evening program to try to introduce himself anew,
despite 16 years in Congress and nearly eight as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier testimonials from friends and family colored in the
corners of Gore's self-portrait: young farm hand, Vietnam vet,
mountain-climber, surrogate brother to his sister's kindly widower.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke of his exhaustive open meetings with constituents,
which he promised to continue in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to go out to you, the people, because I want to stay
in touch with your hopes, with the quiet, everyday heroism of
hardworking Americans,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''... For almost 25 years now, I've been fighting for people.''
</P>
<P>
   He outlined his stock proposals to create tax-free savings
accounts for retirement and college tuition; alleviate the estate
tax for people passing on a small business or family farm; increase
the minimum wage; codify employment rights for gays and lesbians;
hire 50,000 new community police; mandate child-safety trigger
locks on handguns; protect abortion rights, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said Gore only offered ''more of
the same old language of class warfare, partisanship and
division.''
</P>
<P>
   On campaign finance, which continues to dog Gore since his 1996
activities remain under Justice Department investigation, Gore won
a roar with his pledge to ''get all the special-interest money --
all of it -- out of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't take no for an answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore followed to the Staples Center's futuristic podium Mrs.
Gore's gauzy, biographical slide show and an Oprah-style
presentation of personal testimonials from friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Frush led Gore and his teen-age son to the 14,411-foot
summit of Mount Rainier last summer through rain, 30 mph winds,
driving hail and fog.
</P>
<P>
   ''Grace under pressure, strength of character, perseverance.
These are qualities that I want in a mountaineer and that we need
in a president,'' said Frush, a Seattle-area attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al always seemed to be a regular easygoing fellow,'' Bob
Delabar said of the old Army buddy he remembers as a real cutup.
</P>
<P>
   Gore enlisted after graduating from Harvard and then volunteered
to go to Vietnam. There, Gore served seven months as an Army
reporter. ''He chose to stand beside all of us and put his life on
the line,'' said Delabar.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Armistead, here to play down Gore's upbringing in
Washington, D.C., with his senator-father, spent boyhood summers
''of hard work'' with young Al on the Gore family farm in middle
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Also taking the microphone was spotlight-shy Frank Hunger,
husband of Gore's late sister Nancy, who died of lung cancer in
1984 at the age of 46. Gore's companion on the campaign trail,
Hunger spoke about the four Gore children.
