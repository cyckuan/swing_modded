<HEADLINE> Agfa May Enter Into List of Brussels' Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Agfa photo company may enter into
top 20 list of the Belgian stock exchange's benchmark index after
half of its shares are sold by Germany's Bayer AG on Brussels and
Frankfurt bourses this week in one of Europe's largest initial
public offerings (IPO) this year.
</P>
<P>
Shares of the Belgium-based Agfa-Gevaert NV have been priced at
22 euros (22.95 US dollars) and the trading is to start Tuesday on
the Brussels Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Agfa-Gevaert will enhance stature of the Bel20,
the Brussels Exchange's benchmark index, analysts say, as the
company, with a larger market value, is likely to leapfrog such
companies as the zinc refiner Union Miniere SA and Belgian
retailer GIB Group SA.
</P>
<P>
"We really think the quality of the Bel20 will rise," Philippe
Verstraete was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying. "Now it's got
companies on there that don't really belong," said Verstraete, an
analist at Smeets Securities who is advising investors to subscribe
to the IPO.
</P>
<P>
The 22-euro share price of Agfa-Gevaert, the No.3 film maker in
the world, will put Agfa's market value at about 3.1 billion euros
(3.23 billion US dollars). "Agfa, Bayer and the banks managing the
sale are convinced that they have set an attractive price that
offers shareholders good potential for the future," Bayer has
said.
</P>
<P>
The sale will raise 1.54 billion euros (1.6 billion US dollars)
as Bayer reorganizes to focus more on drugs and polymers. In
market value, Agfa will eclipse at least seven other companies
among the 20 members of Bel20 index, including steel-wire maker
Bekaert NV, a third of Agfa's size, which will lose its place in
the index if the film company is added.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels Exchange said Agfa would require a market
capitalization of 3 percent of the index's value to join the
benchmark. That suggests a minimum IPO price of 23.60 euros (24.61
US dollars) based on the current value of the Bel20 index,
adjusted for cross-shareholdings.
</P>
<P>
"One of the main reasons we recommand subscribing is we know
that the major institutions will buy the stock" if it enters the
Bel20, Mr. Verstraete said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Double Funds for Romania Starting 2000: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Romania's progress in
macrostability and the economic reform are mandatory processes,
which will contribute to the improvement of its image on external
markets and will ease its access to the capital market, visiting
EU officials said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Giovanni Ravasio, head of the EU General Directorate for
economic and financial relations and coordinator of the
macro-financial assistance for the candidate countries,
underscored that these processes prompted the mobilization of
important EU funds.
</P>
<P>
Francois Lamoureux, the head of the General Directorate for
relations with the Central and East European countries and
coordinator of the EU enlargement process said that starting the
year 2000, the EU would double its funds for Romania, reaching 350
million Euro.
</P>
<P>
No other East-European county, with the exception of Romania,
receives such funds, the EU official said, adding that they want
to be sure that the funds ''will be used function of a series of
priorities of the Executive, that are clear and precise''.
</P>
<P>
With reference to the loan the EU will give Romania for
balancing its trade, Ravasio announced that there already was a
principle agreement in this respect and the negotiations were on
track and were to be followed by the signing of a Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Romania will be able to use all the money it will
receive from the EU, Lamoureaux said he hoped it would be able to
take in the money and stressed that the funds should not exceed 4
percent of Romania's GDP.
</P>
<P>
The EU officials are in Romania to finalize the EU's strategy
of support to the Romanian Government regarding the economic
reform and to hold talks on the process of Romania's admission to
the EU, with a look to the Helsinki summit of next December.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Pledges Reform in Civil Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
Monday pledged to "modernize" the country's archaic public service
through a program of staff re-orientation, pay increment and law
reform.
</P>
<P>
Already, two pillars of the service, the civil service rules
and financial regulation were being updated to make them
consistent with modern management practise, Obasanjo said during
an unscheduled meeting with civil servants in capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo repeated a campaign promise to pay "adequate
remuneration" for the country's 600,000-strong public servants,
whose size had been cut by the last military regime to promote
efficiency and reduce recurrent expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The reduction came after the government had agreed on a pay
rise with the umbrella trade union for public sector workers.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt. Urges to Reopen Closed Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- All mines which closed in the past
should consider reopening again to generate more employment,
Zimbabwean Minister of Mines, Environment and Tourism Simon Moyo
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said the government is making efforts to revisit every
mine, which was closed in the past because of financial problems,
to find ways of resuscitating those to reemploy hundreds of people
who lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the official opening of a three-day seminar, the
minister said that mining is an essential sector of the economy
which contributed about seven percent to the growth domestic
product (GDP) and 35 percent to net foreign currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
"The main commodities being sought after are diamonds, gold,
platinum group metals, copper and nickel," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government recognized the role played by
small- and medium-scale mining in job creation and rural
development.
</P>
<P>
The mining industry employs about 40,000 people. Despite the
current low prices of minerals, Zimbabwe has more than 290
exclusive prospecting orders compared with 238 at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The seminar organized by the Mine Workers Association is being
attended by about 50 representatives from different mines
throughout the southern African country.

<HEADLINE> NATO Spokesman Says Make-up of Kosovo Force Not Negotiable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The make-up of the future
international security force in Kosovo must be centered around
NATO and is not negotiable, said NATO spokesman James Shea on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with radio France-Info in Brussels, Shea said
that it is one thing to have a peace keeping force without rules
of engagement or robust armaments, and another thing to have one
equipped with these.
</P>
<P>
``We know that the situation in Kosovo will be very difficult
once the Serb forces leave. There should be a force which has the
respect of all and which could create a climate of security for
the return of the refugees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Shea said that NATO will play an important but not
``monopolist'' role in the future international force in Kosovo,
which could also have troops from Russia and other NATO's partner
countries as its members.

<HEADLINE> Demining Activities Paralyzed in Angola: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Due to renewed civil war, the
demining activities have paralyzed across Angola, a senior Angolan
official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Helder Cruz, Director of the National Bureau for Removing
Obstacles and Explosives, told Xinhua that the 19 demining teams
of the government have shrunk into five as a result of the fierce
fighting and the lack of financial support.
</P>
<P>
The remaining five teams can only afford to advertising the
harm of the land mines, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The demining projects have all come to a halt while most of the
foreign experts in the bureau have returned home, Cruz said,
adding that even over half of the Angolan personnel in his bureau
left.
</P>
<P>
The director noted that the demining teams, sponsored by
foreign governments or non-governmental organizations, have moved
to other countries such as Mozambique and Cambodia due to
insecurity in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Cruz said that there are 370 to 400 cases of land mine
explosion in Angola each year, causing a lot of casualties.
</P>
<P>
As the war has escalated and the rebels of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have planted more
land mines, the causalities will increase, the director pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Angola is one of the countries which have numerous land mines.
 According to statistics released by the United Nations, more than
11 million land mines had been planted in the war-torn country
over the past three decades, posing great danger to the life of
Angolans and the economy there.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Main Opposition Appeals for End of NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Party of Social Democracy of
Romania on Monday requested a Parliament's joint session to pass a
statement that should propose an end of air raids on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The draft statement of the major Opposition mentioned the
losses the Yugoslav and the international communities have
suffered during the two months of war, reading that "from the
beginning of the conflict more than one thousand civilian died and
more than 6,000 injured people were registered and Romania's
losses amount to almost one billion dollars".
</P>
<P>
Specifying that "more than 70 percent of the Romanian public
opinion is in favor of an end of air strikes on Yugoslavia, at
least temporarily", the party proposes that Romania's Parliament
should address an appeal to all the NATO countries, the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the Parliament
of the Russian Federation to adopt a political stance that should
lead to an end of conflict in Kosovo.

PARIS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- ``Chief Jean,'' a Frenchman from
Marseille who was proclaimed in 1997 a ``prince'' of Nigeria by
the king of Ibeju, a small kingdom of Yorouba in southwest

<HEADLINE> Iraq, India Sign Cooperation Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and India on Monday signed an
agreement on economic and oil cooperation, the Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid
and his Indian counterpart K. Ramamurthy who arrived here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said in a statement that the two countries agreed to
strengthen cooperation in the fields of industry, oil, agriculture
and trade.
</P>
<P>
Terming the signing of the agreement as a significant step
toward more cooperation between Iraq and India, Rashid said that
Indian companies would work together with their Iraqi partners to
modernize Iraq's oil industry, especially in the oil refinery
sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Iraq will meet a large percentage of
India's needs for crude oil under the framework of the current
sixth phase of the U.N. oil-for-food program, and will meet all
India's needs for oil in the future.
</P>
<P>
The sixth phase of the oil-for-food deal, which took effect
last week, allows Iraq to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth
of oil in six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and India agreed that the forthcoming session of the
Iraqi-Indian joint committee for economic, trade cooperation will
be held in Baghdad in July, said Rashid.
</P>
<P>
He added that Indian companies will participate in the
oil-for-food program to meet the needs of Iraqi oil sector for
spare parts.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ramamurthy said that his meeting with President
Saddam Hussein is an important step that will actively raise the
level of relations between the two countries, adding that his
visit to Iraq has brought about positive results.
</P>
<P>
The Indian minister stressed that his country will continue to
contact with Iraq to implement Iraq's oil projects and to train
Iraq's oil staff in India, saying that his country is determined
to sign long-term contracts with Iraq in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Reopen Largest Giza Pyramid Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will reopen the Pyramid of
Cheops, the largest of the famous Giza trio, on Thursday after
more than a year of repair work, an official in charge of
antiquities said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gaballah Ali Gaballah, secretary general of the Higher
Antiquities Council, told reporters that the Sphinx temple and
three tombs near the pyramid will also be opened to visitors at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture Farouk Abdel Aziz Hosni will inaugurate the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, Egypt mended the cracks of the Pyramid of
Cheops, cleaned up graffiti and installed new lighting and
ventilation system.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the pyramid, built as a tomb for King Cheops
some 4,500 years ago, is viewed as part of Egypt's efforts to
welcome the new millennium and attract visitors to boost its
economy.
</P>
<P>
Gaballah said Egypt repaired the Sphinx temple in 12 months
following a 10-year face-lift for the nearly 4,500-year-old
half-lion, half-man figure.
</P>
<P>
The 20-meter by 20-meter temple, which stands in front of the
Sphinx, has 24 pillars representing the day's hours. It has also
two carved niches that depict sunrise and sunset.
</P>
<P>
Two of the newly discovered three tombs belong to Nefer Maet,
King Chefren's son and his prime minister and to Sneferu-kha-ef,
the king's treasurer. The third tomb belongs to Shesem-nefer,
whose title was secret keeper to a king whose name historians were
not able to identify.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 31 (Xinhua)--Three days before European Union (EU)'s
summit in Cologne, leading Social Democrats from European
countries Monday at their meeting in Bonn urged an effective fight
against the high jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
" It is our first and most important task in Europe," said
German Defence Minister Rudolf Scharping, who hosted the meeting
as chairman of the European Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
A more concrete employment pact should be passed at the two-day
summit, Scharping said.
</P>
<P>
Amid an overall jobless rate over 8 per cent, the EU has
drafted an employment pact, which is expected to be passed at the
Cologne summit.
</P>
<P>
Former President of European Commission, Jacques Delors,
reminded EU members of their responsibility in the employment
policy.
</P>
<P>
The planned employment pact is not enough for Europa, and EU
should do more to coordinate and control its members' national
policies, said Delors.
</P>
<P>
Another urgent task is to fight against crimes with a common
security policy, said the Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Under the common foreign and security policy, the EU members
must find common points in their national interests, and must
concretely decide in which fields to cooperate wisely with each
other, said former Spanish Prime Minister Felips Gonzalez.

<HEADLINE> Canada's GDP Up in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Strong showings in most industrial
sectors combined to produce a 0.3 percent increase in Canada's
gross domestic product(GDP) in March, Statistics Canada said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The latest increase extended the economy's steady expansion
since strikes put the brakes on growth in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
The statistics agency said manufacturers raised output
significantly in March, more than offsetting a decline in February
which was the first in seven months. Increased computer
wholesaling and auto retailing lifted the business sector and
business service providers expanded as well.
</P>
<P>
Construction activity was little changed after several months
of increase, and mining output fell sharply in March.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1999, the GDP rise 0.8 percent, or 3.4
percent on an annualized basis.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the booming American economy, signs that the
worst of Asia's economic crisis may be over, improved consumer
confidence and the absence of major work stoppages all played to
the Canadian economy's advantage in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers raised output 0.7 percent in March, more than
reversing a 0.3 percent decline in the previous month and putting
the industry back on a solid growth path after a strike-induced
slump in the summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Higher production of electronic, transportation and primary
metal products was partly offset by declines in the printing and
publishing and wood products industries.
</P>
<P>
Wholesalers increased sales by 1.3 percent in March, capping a
robust first quarter. Computer sales were big and distributors of
farm machinery and supplies showed gains after 18 months of
lackluster performance.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales rose 0.5 percent as most store types enjoyed solid,
if unspectacular, gains. Auto dealers, automotive parts stores and
sellers of semi-durables reported increases.

HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Rich countries are imposing policies
that shattered natural resources management in developing
countries, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said in Harare
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The policies have made our natural resources excessively cheap
while limiting our ability to export value-added natural
resources," he said when opening a National Environment
Conservation Conference to debate issues affecting people in the
areas of environment and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
He noted that rich countries are destroying the environment
management programs through mean aid programs, economic policies
and attitudes.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the policies have resulted in
developing countries trapped in indebtedness, excessive resource
extractions and perpetual exportation of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also said there was need to review environment
legislation in Zimbabwe to conform with requirements of
sustainable utilization of resources.
</P>
<P>
At the three-day conference organized by the Natural Resources
Board, over 500 delegates would examine the implications of the
country's Environment Management Bill.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said his government is confident the bill would lead to
sustainable management of the environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes on
Monday continued to violate Iraqi airspace in the north and south
of the country, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:42 (0642 GMT) 23 formations of
enemy warplanes from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated southern
Iraqi airspace over Basra, Thi-Qar, Qadisiya, Misan and Muthana
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi anti-aircraft units repulsed the enemy planes at
14:00 (1000 GMT), the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Eleven formations of enemy warplanes coming from the Turkish
airspace violated northern Iraqi airspace over Neineva, Dohuk and
Erbil provinces at 10:25 (0625 GMT), said the spokesman, adding
that Iraqi air defenses repelled the enemy planes at 14:10 (1010
GMT).
</P>
<P>
Since last December's U.S. and British bombardment of Iraq,
their warplanes have made 5,775 sorties in the south and 1,457
sorties in the north of the country, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes against
Iraq in mid-December last year to retaliate what they called
Iraq's failure to fully cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors in
charge of eliminating Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Since last December, the U.S. and British warplanes have been
regularly attacking Iraqi military and civilian targets in these
restricted zones, causing severe civilian casualties and property
damages.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Regrets IRA Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Sinn Fein
President Gerry Adams expressed his "regret" on Monday at the
deaths of eight IRA victims who went missing in the 1970s and
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
But he said it was just one of the "injustices" which sprung
from the Troubles.
</P>
<P>
Adams was speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today program as police in
the Irish Republic resumed their search for the remains of IRA
victims.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional IRA has supplied details through intermediaries
of the locations of eight victims -- all but one of whom were
Roman Catholics who went missing from Northern Ireland between
1972 and 1981.
</P>
<P>
The paramilitaries have named seven sites south of the border
and on Friday police discovered a body, believed to be that of
Eamon Molloy, at one of those -- a graveyard at Faughart in County
Louth.
</P>
<P>
Adams said: "These things happen in war...in war horrible
things are done and there can be no attempt by me to minimise that
or in any way diminish the responsibility of republicans."
</P>
<P>
Police began digging at three of the other six sites on Monday
morning. They are hopeful of finding remains at Carlingford,
County Louth, Culloville, County Monaghan and Ballynulty, County
Wicklow.
</P>
<P>
Officers leading the operation have acknowledged they are
relying on the memories of IRA personnel about events dating back
more than a quarter of a century.

<HEADLINE> Rally in Zambia Marking World No-Tobacco Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is drawing up a national
action plan against tobacco and has started collaboration with the
World Health Organization (WHO) in promoting smoking cessation.
</P>
<P>
Gavin Silwemba, Deputy Director-General of Zambia Central Board
of Health, said this on Monday at a rally marking the World
No-Tobacco Day.
</P>
<P>
WHO representative in Zambia Edward Maganu said at the rally
that there is a lower number of smokers in Africa, and Zambia in
particular, compared with other regions.
</P>
<P>
However, the WHO official noted that the number of African
smokers should be reduced further by preventing tobacco use in
children and adolescents, reducing family exposure to tobacco and
providing treatment medications.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to a time when tobacco smoking in
public and work places will be a thing of the past," he said.

<P>
BONN, May 31 (Xinhua)--German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
Monday indirectly recommended present NATO Secretary General,
Javier Solana, as European Union (EU) coordinator for foreign and
security policies.
</P>
<P>
The former Spanish foreign minister has worked very well in
Brussels, said Schroeder at a presidium session of his Social
Democratic Party (SPD) in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
It won't be bizarre that Schroeder formally nominate Solana for
the post at EU's summit meeting scheduled for June 3 in Cologne,
said SPD's federal manager, Ottmar Scheiner.
</P>
<P>
Solana, whose term in NATO will end in January, 2000, has won
support of Britain, Italy and Spain for the post as "Minister
Europa".
</P>
<P>
But diplomats in Bonn said four neutral EU members remained
reserved towards Solana, saying he stands too close with the
United States. The four countries are Austria, Finland, Sweden
and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The four countries said Solana's engagement in the Kosovo
crisis would have a negative effect on his support for Europa's
common foreign policy.

<HEADLINE> Environment Worsening in Zimbabwe: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A recent research has revealed that
the the environment situation in Zimbabwe is worsening, Permanent
Secretary of the Zimbabwean Ministry of Mines, Environment and
Tourism, Charles Chipato said in Harare Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chipato told the National Conference on Environmental
Management and Natural Resources Conservation that since the first
report on the country's environment was released in 1992, Zimbabwe
has had to grapple with increasing environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
"The worsening economic and ecological environment have caught
the majority of the people in a vicious circle," said the
permanent secretary.
</P>
<P>
"An increasing population surviving on reduced natural
resources has caused growing conflict over access to resources,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"An unfriendly economic environment characterized by falling
investment, dis-investment and job loses forces people to
over-exploit natural resources," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chipato said his ministry had developed a National Biodiversity
Strategy and action plan which would seek to enable the government
to identify priority areas and actions which should be taken to
conserve and utilize biological heritage sustainably.
</P>
<P>
The government had also established a national action plan
under the desertification convention, he said.

MOSCOW, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin
expressed hope Monday that talks on Yugoslavia on Bonn Tuesday
would yield positive results in bringing a political settlement to
the Balkan crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The week should bring a certain decision...if everything
proceeds according to plan," Chernomyrdin said after a meeting
with Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's envoy for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin is scheduled to fly to Bonn Tuesday for a fresh
round of tripartite talks with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari
and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
He said German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder would join in for
the final stage of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Following the Bonn talks, Chernomyrdin will go to Belgrade,
possibly together with Ahtisaari, to meet with Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"A framework for a positive solution for a Yugoslav settlement
has been worked out" but the "mechanisms and the principles for
putting it into practice" pose the major obstacles, he said.
</P>
<P>
He again urged NATO to halt its air raids on Yugoslavia, which
entered the 69th day Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The West must understand what might happen if this concrete
decision is not made" at the trilateral talks, he said.

<P>
LAGOS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's new President Olusegun
Obasanjo Monday suspended and put to review of all the contracts
and appointments signed by the former administration between

The new president ordered that henceforth Nigerian embassies
abroad must ensure that the processing of all visa applications be

<HEADLINE> Aidid's Faction Attacks Against Guerrilla Bases in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 31(Xinhua) -- The Somali faction, headed by
Hussein Mohamed Aidid, Sunday afternoon launched reprisal attacks
against the militia positions of the Rahanwein Resistance Army (
RRA) outside Baidoa Town in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Aidid's militia unofficial sources claimed that they have
killed 15 and captured eight RRA fighters , while they have lost
two soldiers and eight others have sustained gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the RRA side does not claim
victory nor talk about inflicting heavy losses on the side of
Aidid.
</P>
<P>
This is the most serious and disastrous fighting for the RRA
since they have intensified their campaign of hit and run against
Aidid in Baidoa town following the rumors that a consignment of
Somali bank notes arrival for Aidid in the town.
</P>
<P>
There's no official word from Aidid's side over the fighting,
but some of his militiamen have declared their determination of
wiping out all of the RRA bases around Baidoa town. Hussein Aidid
is himself in Baidoa town encouraging the clashes.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from field radios, fierce
fighting broke out around the E1-Don RRA militia base and hundreds
of militiamen of both sides were involved in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses in Baidoa said that heavily armed infantry
militiamen from Aidid's side have gone out of the town Sunday
morning to attack the militia RRA bases outside the town.
</P>
<P>
Aidid's militia commanders have apparently changed the tactic
of using battle wagons after the RRA fighters have strengthened
their defensive positions with land mines to seal off all the
roads leading to their bases.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses also said Aidid militiamen surprisingly came
from every corner of E1-Don militia base, which the RRA commanders
were only prepared for battle wagons from their enemies.
</P>
<P>
According to the VHR radio reports, loud noise of the
rocket-propelled grenades,attack hand grenades and machine guns
could be heard throughout Baidoa Sunday afternoon and the early
hours of Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has also been confirmed by the RRA spokesman here
in Mogadishu. The spokesman, Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinleh, said the
fighting has so far reached their militia base at E1-Don, 12Km
North of Baidoa town.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also confirmed their field radio went out of the
air, an indication that their base was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is still continuing, the spokesman said, but he
declined to admit that the base has fallen for Aidid's militiamen.
</P>
<P>
However, independent sources have confirmed that the E1-Don
militia base of the RRA has fallen for Aidid's side Sunday night
and that a counter- attack has Monday been launched by the RRA
fighters in their attempt of regaining control of their base.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Launches Livestock Development Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Monday launched a
national livestock development project to enhance food security,
reduce poverty and increase the country's foreign exchange
earnings.
</P>
<P>
The five-year project, which includes livestock production,
animal health, forage production and project management, will be
implemented in all regions in the Horn of African country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a five-day launching workshop,
Ethiopian acting minister of Agriculture, Mengistu Huluka, said
despite rich resources, the livestock sub-sector provides the
lowest per capita output of livestock products compared with other
African countries.
</P>
<P>
"Output from the livestock industry has not been accommodating
all the need of the rapidly increasing population of the country,"
the acting minister was quoted by the Ethiopian News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The acting minister attributed the low level of production to
poor genetic potential of the national herd, poor nutrition,
disease-based stresses, unsatisfactory management and absence of
appropriate market structures.
</P>
<P>
He said that "under such conditions it became impossible to
fulfil the minimum requirements of consumers, let alone catering
the need of the agro- industries."
</P>
<P>
The African Development Bank and the Ethiopian government will
finance the 39 million U.S. dollars project.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the project is expected to produce 288,000
tons of milk, 43,400 tons of beef and mutton, as well as 511,000
tons of fodder products annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin talked over the phone with U.S. President Bill Clinton
Russia stepped up its efforts to find a political solution to the
Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Stepashin-Clinton telephone conversation went ahead
according to prior arrangement between Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, the government information department
said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow provided no detail on the conversation except noting
that both sides agreed to maintain active dialogue toward
broadening bilateral ties and cooperation in the international
arena, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stepashin and Yeltsin's envoy for Yugoslavia Viktor
Chernomyrdin met again Monday to discuss Moscow's moves on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who is scheduled to fly to Bonn Tuesday to meet
with envoys of the United States and the European Union, also held
talks with Eduard Kukan, the Slovak foreign minister now serving
as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting between German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, Russian presidential envoy for
Yugoslavia Viktor Chernomyrdin, and U.S.Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott Tuesday in Bonn has acquired particular
importance," the Russian government's information department said.
</P>
<P>
After the Bonn meeting, Chernomyrdin is expected to fly to
Belgrade, possibly together with Ahtisaari, to meet Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a ranking Russian official reiterated
Monday that if NATO continues its military operations, especially
if it launches a ground phase, if the U.S. side shows no interest
in a peaceful solution of the Kosovo problem, "a negative process
that would be very difficult to reverse could begin" in
Russian-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia, which started on March
24, has entered its 69th day Monday and resulted in the death of
over 1,500 innocent civilians and the destruction of much of the
Balkan country's industrial infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Russian Security Council deputy secretary Valentin Sobolev,
following a meeting with the U.S. Aspen strategic group, said NATO
operations against Yugoslavia are violating all international law
norms.
</P>
<P>
They have harmed and continue to seriously harm
Russian-American relations, and undermine stability in Europe and
the whole world, he said.

<HEADLINE> Prisoners, Overseas Citizen Not to Vote in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Malawian Electoral Commission
said Monday that prisoners and citizens living abroad will not
vote in the forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections
slated for June 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the commission Justice Hames Kalaile said this when
responding to a question from journalists whether prisoners will
be able to vote on the polling day, the Malawi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We acknowledge that prisoners have a right to vote but, as for
1999 elections, they will not vote since the necessary
arrangements for them have not been put in place," Kalaile was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the only group which has been left out. Malawians
who are resident abroad would not be able to vote," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that "we must consider making provisions for them
to vote in future elections."
</P>
<P>
He said the prisoners could have voted if prison authorities
had made arrangements on how to move the prisoners to the polling
centers.
</P>
<P>
As regards the aged and blind who may not be able to make any
mark on the ballot paper, Kalaile advised that they should bring
with them a person they trust to help them vote properly.

DHAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Monday launched a
one-million-U.S.-dollar sustainable resource management project in
brackish water areas to establish an environmentally-sound,
economically viable and socially equitable community in the
country's coastal rice-shrimp culture zone.
</P>
<P>
This project, which is being aided by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), was launched under the sustainable
environment management program (SEMP), the national news agency
BSS reported.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to help make people aware of the
degradation of the environment and involve them in protecting the
quality of the eco-system, UNDP assistant resident representative
Shireen Kamal Sayeed was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It would involve poor and marginal farmers in eco-friendly
demonstration activities and support the beneficiaries in
improving their sanitation practices and water supply, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Environment and Forest Ministry is executing a unique 26
million-dollar SEMP, and brackish water management project is one
of the major intervention areas of this largest ever UNDP-funded
environment program across the world, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Still Waiting for Indian Response on Talks Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has not as yet received
any official communication from India on its offer for talks to
defuse tension at the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir, Foreign
Office spokesman Tariq Altaf said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen media reports that India has accepted the offer
but there has not been any official communication from India in
this regard, so far," Altaf told a press briefing here on the
situation at LoC.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif proposed in a telephone talk with
his Indian counterpart Atal Behari Vajpayee last Friday to send
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz to New Delhi to find ways and means
to defuse the latest tension on the LoC which, Pakistan said, has
been escalated by Indian air strikes and violations of LoC.
</P>
<P>
To a question about the Indian deployment of Mirage-2000 jets
in India-administered Kashmir, the spokesman said that Pakistan on
Monday expressed deep concern over the reported deployment of the
Mirage-2000 fighters for air strikes against "Kashmiri Mujahideen
(holy fighters)."
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely regrettable that India has brought in such
sophisticated weapons, it is unprecedented and absolutely
unacceptable," Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has held telephone conversation with Prime
Minister Sharif on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Albright talked to Sharif last night, Altaf said. However, he
did not give details of the conversation.

<HEADLINE> France to Contribute Up to 7,000 Soldiers to Kosovo Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- France could contribute from 6,000 to
7,000 soldiers to the future international peace force in Kosovo
(KFOR) after a ceasefire agreement is reached between NATO and
Yugoslavia, said a top French military officer on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The chief of general staff of the French armed forces, General
Jean-Pierre Kelche, said in a television interview that if
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic decides to withdraw his
troops from Kosovo, NATO will not ``crush'' the entire Yugoslav
forces if they leave.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that the announcement by Milosevic that he
will accept the principles of the Group of Eight for solving the
Kosovo conflict, which includes a withdrawal of Serbian forces
from Kosovo, should be confirmed by concrete action.
</P>
<P>
Kelche said that whatever happens in the coming days or weeks,
NATO will not be able to re-settle all the Kosovar refugees in
their homes before the arrival of winter.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that France, which is contributing to 10
percent of the NATO air force in its air campaign against
Yugoslavia, has so far completed 20 percent of the missions of
reconnaissance of the ``Allied Force'' operation over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the French aircraft carrier Foch, which will leave
Monday evening Adriatic Sea to return to its base in Toulon, will
be replaced by a frigate which is on its way to the combat zone.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of Foch means that France will reduce by one
fourth the number of its warplanes participating in the NATO air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
But France is ready to respond to supplementary demands by the
Supreme Commander of NATO in Europe, Wesley Clark, especially on
participation in attacks on ground targets, he said.

<HEADLINE> Judgment Reserved in Case of S. Africa's Botha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Cape High Court
Monday reserved judgment in the appeal by former state president
P.W. Botha against his conviction for snubbing the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC).
</P>
<P>
As the hearing drew to an end Monday, two judges heard attorney
for the state, Bruce Morrison, describe Botha as an "extremely
stubborn man who saw fit to call the TRC a circus," South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Morrison said Botha had initially appeared willing to testify
before the TRC, on condition the impression was sent out to the
world that he was appearing before an inquiry and not before a
tribunal hearing as such.
</P>
<P>
"He would have testified had he been able to do so in such a
manner that saved face," Morrison contended.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was launched before judges Selwyn Selikowitz and
John Foxcroft by Botha's legal team, comprising Lapa Laubscher and
Ernst Penzhorn.
</P>
<P>
Laubscher described Botha's sentence -- 10,000 rand (1,600 U.S.
dollars) or 12 months in prison, plus 12 months conditionally
suspended for five years -- as "shockingly inappropriate".
</P>
<P>
He compared it with a 50-rand (eight dollars) fine or 30 days
sentence imposed 24 years ago on an offender who had refused to
take the oath or answer questions before a commission of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
However, Morrison countered that the sentence imposed on Botha
was fair, considering his attitude to the TRC and the fact that he
had stultified it.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A total of 25,000 South
Africans die of tobacco-related illnesses every year, the Health
Department said Monday, the World No-Tobacco Day.
</P>
<P>
The department said in a statement that smokers lose an average
of 12 years of their lives in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by the Human Sciences Research Council and the
Medical Research Council indicates that 25 percent of South
Africans smoke, while the habit is growing among children at an
alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
"The harmful effects of cigarette smoke on the health of
non-smokers are of serious concern, and public smoking further
encourages this," said the health department.
</P>
<P>
Legislation was approved earlier this year to restrict smoking
in public places, to prohibit tobacco advertising and
sponsorships, and to prevent children younger than 16 years from
buying cigarettes.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Court on Rwanda Gets 3 New Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Three new judges of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) were sworn in
Monday in Arusha, northern Tanzania, the court said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
The judges were sworn in at the opening ceremony of the sixth
plenary session of the court based in Arusha Town.
</P>
<P>
Mehmet Guney of Turkey and Erik Mose of Norway were appointed
last November to replace the judges who did not seek re-election
to a second term of office.
</P>
<P>
Asoka de Zoysa Gunawardana of Sri Lanka, replaces Judge
Dionysios Kondylis of Greece who resigned from Trial Chamber III
on March 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
Their appointments bring to nine the total number of judges of
the trial chambers of the tribunal, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech after the swearing-in, legal counsel Hans Corell,
representing United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
commended the work being done by the tribunal in bringing to
justice the planners and ring leaders of the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
</P>
<P>
Corell also reaffirmed the secretary-general's support for the
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Before his appointment to the tribunal, Guney was an ambassador
in the Turkish diplomatic service and in 1998 led his country's
delegation to the United Nations Diplomatic Conference on the
Establishment of an International Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
Mose served as Judge of the Borgarting Court of Appeals, Oslo.
 Gunawardana was a Judge of the Court of Appeals of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The plenary session will continue until the end of this week
with several meetings at which judges will discuss amendment of
the Rules and Procedure and also elect a new president for a
mandate of two years.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. court on Rwanda was created by the U.N. Security
Council in November 1994 after the genocide took place in the
middle of that year. More than 500,000 people were reportedly
killed in the genocide.

<HEADLINE> Rhinos Endangered in Tanzanian Game Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Rhinos are the most
endangered species in southern Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve,
Africa's largest protected area, a wildlife expert observed in Dar
es Salaam Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ludwig Siege, a senior management official of the game reserve,
said that the current number of rhinos in Selous is between 100 to
200, with a slow reproduction of these animals.
</P>
<P>
"Rhinos are the most endangered species in the reserve,
especially in the past decades," Siege said, adding that all
measures have been taken to protect the remaining rhinos.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in 1976 in Selous Reserve showed that there
were more than 3,000 of rhinos, but the number dwindled due to
poaching especially in early 1980s, said Siege.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it is encouraging to note that Selous is rich
in wild dogs which have not been infected with the distemper
disease because of their rare or none contact with the domestic
dogs.
</P>
<P>
In Serengeti, a national park in northern Tanzania, wild dogs
are being attacked by the disease due to their connection with the
domesticated dogs in the buffer zone, he said.
</P>
<P>
Selous Game Reserve has been designated a "world heritage site"
by the United Nations due to its unique ecological importance.
</P>
<P>
The German Agency of Technical Cooperation has set aside 515
million shillings (about 725,000 U.S. dollars) in support of
Selous and other two game reserves in Tanzania for the year 1999,
to help them set up wildlife management schemes.

LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Europe's stock markets except
Frankfurt registered final gains towards the end of a subdued
session Monday due to market holidays in both London and New York.
</P>

Paris' share prices closed a lackluster session higher,
supported by bargain hunting of selective stocks. The CAC-40 index
of leading French shares closed up 36.25 points at 4351.29.
</P>
<P>
The market was slightly weaker in early trading before climbing
back in the afternoon on bargain hunting of some of the index's
recent decliners.
</P>
<P>
In Zurich, strong buying of banking stocks helped the SMI jump
almost 124 points, or 1.82 percent, to end at 6911.6.
</P>

Modest Monday advances in Tokyo and Hongkong also helped
sentiment in Europe's markets, but German investors were more
cautious as the ECB warned of trouble ahead for Europe's largest
economy unless it underwent some major surgery.

JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The New National Party (NNP)
has ruled out a coalition with the African National Congress (ANC)
in the Western Cape after South Africa's general election on June
2.
</P>
<P>
Should there be a coalition, the first choice of the NNP would
be one or more of the other opposition parties, South African
Press Association (SAPA) quoted NNP leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk
as saying in Cape Town Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NNP leader said his party is going "full-out" to win the
province on its own.
</P>
<P>
The party currently rules the province, but according to
opinion polls, the two parties are heading for a photo finish.
</P>
<P>
The opinion polls indicate that neither party will get an
absolute majority and a coalition provincial government appears to
be likely.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Richard Calland, a senior political analyst with
the Institute for Democracy in South Africa (Idasa), as saying
Monday that he believed an ANC-NNP coalition in the Western Cape
was the most likely.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to become the
largest information technology market in the Asia-Pacific region
excluding Japan by 2000, according to U.S. market research firm
International Data Corporation (IDC) on Tuesday.

LONDON -- Britain on Tuesday took a cautious stand over
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's apparent acceptance of a
Group of Eight peace plan and insisted that NATO must lead any
peacekeeping force for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It remains to be seen what he's actually accepted," Defense
Secretary George Robertson said in an interview to the Sky

</P>
<P>
"We've made it absolutely clear that our bottom line is that
all Serb troops will leave Kosovo and that there will be an
international security force with NATO at its core," he said.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made as Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari,
the European Union's Balkans envoy, was due to meet his Russian
counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin and U.S. diplomat Strobe Talbott
in Bonn on Tuesday for talks on the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>

to express their desire for peace.
</P>
<P>
This morning, children gathered at the Shangye Kindergarten to
throw their toy guns and knives into garbage cans while other
activities for International Children's Day were going on. "We are
children of the new age and don't want war or violence. We want a

Something needs to be done early on to create a happy and peaceful
life, they said.
</P>
<P>
The organizers said that this action was not specifically
directed at toy manufacturers but was meant to deal with the
present special situation and to express children's hope for peace

ISLAMABAD, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
Tuesday told visiting Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov
that they would not attend the proposed meeting of the "Six Plus

</P>
<P>

<P>
A meeting of the "Six Plus Two" group at deputy foreign

</P>
<P>
The "Six Plus Two" group comprises Afghanistan's six immediate

</P>
<P>
The sources said that Kamilov's talks with the Taliban leaders
were highly "constructive" and the two sides agreed to continue

</P>
<P>
Kamilov is the second foreign minister from a Central Asian

<HEADLINE> Cyprus-China Relations Excellent: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and China, though different
in size and geographically far apart, have had all along excellent
and friendly relations and sincere cooperation, Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a written reply to Xinhua questions before his official
visit to China, which scheduled on June 6-11, Clerides said the
good ties are based on their common adherence to peace and
stability and the principles of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
He said the political dialogue between the two countries for
realization of common objectives was invigorated with the signing
in 1997 of a Protocol of Cooperation between the Ministries of
Foreign Affairs of our two countries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a number of bilateral agreements offer the legal
framework for further expansion of our relations in the fields of
trade, economy and technical cooperation, tourism, health, mass
media and information, culture and education, the President said.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the Cypriot government attaches particular
importance to his forthcoming visit to China, hoping that "my
visit will be a milestone in our bilateral relations and will
give a new impetus to the close and fruitful cooperation in all
fields between our two countries".
</P>
<P>
China, with a remarkably enhanced international status, plays
today a constructive and active role in the world affairs. "We
attach, thus, great importance to our relationship with China
to the further growth of the ties between the two countries,"
the President stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that in view of the longstanding friendship, the close
identity of our positions on major international and regional
issues and the determination of both sides to promote even further
the existing relations and the cooperation, there is ample ground
for further development of our relations.
</P>
<P>
Clerides also said that the Cyprus' people share the grief
of the Chinese people caused by the tragic death of three Chinese
journalists and many wounded as a result of the bombing of the
Embassy building in Belgrade, adding "we condemn outright the
bombing and express our sympathy to the People of China and to the
families of the victims."
</P>
<P>
"We also understand and respect the 'one China policy' of
the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot President expressed the appreciation to China's
"principled and constructive position" on the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Botha Wins Appeal Over Truth Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Former South African President
P. W. Botha Tuesday won his Cape High Court appeal on technical
grounds against his conviction for snubbing the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC).
</P>
<P>
The court set aside both the conviction as well as the sentence
of 10, 000 rand (1,600 U.S. dollars) or 12 months imprisonment,
plus 12 months conditionally suspended, imposed by the regional
court in George, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Judge Selwyn Selikowitz, with Judge John Foxcroft concurring,
upheld the appeal on technical grounds, saying the subpoena
calling Botha to testify before the TRC on December 19, 1997 was
invalid.
</P>
<P>
This meant that Botha, who has branded the TRC a "circus," had
not acted unlawfully by failing to appear before the commission.
</P>
<P>
The subpoena, issued on December 5, was invalid because it
called Botha to appear after the TRC's active life span had
expired on December 14.
</P>
<P>
An amendment act prolonging the truth commission's activity was
only promulgated days after the subpoena was issued and was not
retroactive.
</P>
<P>
The TRC therefore did not have the power to call a hearing on
December 19.
</P>
<P>
State prosecutor Bruce Morrison had urged the court to at least
uphold a conviction on the alternative count -- hindering the
commission in the course of its duties.
</P>
<P>
But the judge said the basis for a conviction on the
alternative count was, like the main charge, dependent on the
validity of the notification itself, and the court was obliged to
reject this as well.
</P>
<P>
The judge said he was aware that "there may be many who may
consider that it is unjust" that Botha should escape on technical
point of law.
</P>
<P>
He added: "The TRC was established to perform a noble and
invaluable task. It remains however a statutory body."
</P>
<P>
Botha, 82, did not appear in the Cape Town court for the
appeal, preferring to stay in his luxury seaside home in George, a
coastal city in southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
His lawyers had argued that the TRC had disregarded its own
legal provisions by issuing the subpoena and had only itself to
blame for the dilemma.
</P>
<P>
The TRC wanted Botha, who ruled with an iron fist between 1978
and 1989, to explain his role in the State Security Council (SSC),
a panel of security chiefs who allegedly condoned the killing of
political opponents and ordered cross-border raids on liberation
activists.
</P>
<P>
The TRC was not able to conclude its work on the SSC before
handing its final report to President Nelson Mandela in October
1998 because of Botha's refusal to cooperate, state lawyers
claimed.
</P>
<P>
The state has the right to appeal against Selikowitz's
decision.
</P>
<P>
Like all senior politicians of the former National Party, which
enforced apartheid and ruled until 1994, Botha claimed to have
known nothing about security force atrocities.
</P>
<P>
But in its final report, the TRC said Botha should be held
accountable for gross human rights violations that occurred during
his 11-year rule, including the killing of political opponents.

<HEADLINE> Germany Receives Letter From Belgrade on Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 1 (Xinhua)--German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
on Tuesday afternoon received a letter from his counterpart in
Belgrade, Zivadin Jovanovic, Bonn's Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann did not give any
detail of the letter, saying it needs to be studied in following
days.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this day, Yugoslav media has said Belgrade expressed in
this letter its readiness to accept the G-8 principles on solving
the Kosovo crisis. The letter was sent on Monday, it said.
</P>
<P>
G-8, seven leading western industrial nations and Russia, in
May passed a statement of "general principles" on solution to the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The statement demanded a full withdrawal of Yugoslav troops
from Kosovo and deployment of an international peacekeeping force
with NATO at its core.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade's letter was addressed to the chairman of European
Union (EU)'s Council of Ministers, a post that Fischer currently
holds, said Erdmann, adding that the letter has come later
possibly due to some "technical reasons".
</P>
<P>
In a relative development, Fischer on Tuesday warned against a
possible escalation of Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The following days will be decisive," said Fischer in Berlin
at a meeting of EU's committee of national parliaments and the
European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Patience is needed in current situation, and if the diplomatic
mediations fail, the war will escalate, he said.
</P>
<P>
Later this day, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is due to
hold a meeting on Kosovo crisis with the EU mediator, Finnish
President Martti Ahtisaari, Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, and
U.S. deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbote.

<HEADLINE> New Chinese Names for Tropical Cyclones to Be Used From 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- New Chinese names for tropical
cyclones will be used with effect from January 1, 2000, the Hong
Kong Observatory announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macao will adopt the same
set of Chinese names for tropical cyclones to avoid confusion
arising from multiple Chinese translations for any given name, a
spokesman for the Hong Kong Observatory said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the Hong Kong Observatory, the China National
Meteorological Center, and the Macao Meteorological and
Geophysical Services have discussed the subject and agreed to a
common set of Chinese names.
</P>
<P>
The English version of a new list of Asia-Pacific names for
tropical cyclones was adopted by the Typhoon Committee at its 31st
Session held in Manila, the Philippines, at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
From the year 2000, tropical cyclones in the western North
Pacific and the South China Sea will be assigned names from the
list. It consists of a total of 140 names contributed by 14
countries and regions, including 10 names provided by the Hong
Kong Observatory.
</P>
<P>
With effect from the year 2000, the spokesman said, the Tokyo
Typhoon Center of Japan will assign a serial number and a name
from the new list to every tropical cyclone attaining tropical
storm strength.
</P>
<P>
Apart from being used in forecasts and warnings issued to the
international aviation and shipping communities, the name will
also be used officially in information on tropical cyclones issued
to the international press.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Typhoon Committee members will also adopt
these names in their respective regions subject to local
circumstances. The Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macao therefore
agreed upon a uniformed set of Chinese names.

<HEADLINE> Railway in Northwestern China Cuts International Transport Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Xinjiang Railway
Company announced today that it will rescind or lower some
international railway transport fees.
</P>
<P>
Subsidies for trains used for international freight transport
and charges for trains using the special line linking with the
Alataw Pass Station will be rescinded, and three other types of
fees mainly for international railway transport through the pass,
which is in the northern part of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
The railway section in northern Xinjiang is an important part
of the new Eurasian Continental Bridge. It starts from Urumqi's
West Station and connects with a railway in Kazakahstan at Alataw
Pass. It handles more than six million tons of goods and 1.63
million passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
By cutting fees, the Northern Xinjiang Railway Company will
lose more than 20 million yuan (about 2.5 million U.S. dollars) in
income a year, but it will increase its transport volume and get
more from the new Eurasian land bridge.

PARIS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Marcelo Rios failed to reach the last
four at the French Open on Tuesday, losing to Slovak Dominik
Hrbaty in four sets.
</P>
<P>
Hrbaty, ranked 30th in the world, won the tough competition 7-6,
6-2, 6-7, 6-2, booking his first ever semifinal at a Grand Slam

But the Chilean looked tired after his five-set defeat of
Spain's Alberto Berasategui in the previous round, unusually
making a series of unforced errors in the two hours and 28 minutes
match.

<P>
Hrbaty, the winner of the Prague tournament earlier this season,

<HEADLINE> HK Financial Secretary on Coming Middle East Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang said Tuesday that his forthcoming trip to Middle East
countries is to strengthen ties with the region.
</P>
<P>
Tsang will lead a high-level mission to Dubai in the United
Arab Emirates, and the Gulf state of Bahrain from June 5 to 8.
</P>
<P>
The major objective of the mission is to explore ways to expand
Hong Kong's business partnership with the Middle East and maximize
its huge potential, especially as a services market.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said: "The mission of the trip is to strengthen our ties
with and project a higher commercial profile Hong Kong has in this
gateway to the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Dubai and Hong Kong bear many similarities. "We both are the
leading trading center, transportation and tourism hub of the
region. Similarly, Bahrain is the financial center of the Middle
East. There are ample business opportunities between Hong Kong and
the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to get the message to our trading partners
that Hong Kong has come a long way with our economic adjustment.
There are signs that our economy has bottomed out and that costs
are coming down in significant terms. The East Asian region as a
whole offers a good buy and stands ready for foreign investment,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Trade Development Council, the mission is also
a strategic initiative to stimulate exports of consumer products
and further diversify Hong Kong's portfolio of a promising
emerging market.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Tsang on the visit will be Michael Sze, executive
director of the Trade Development Council, and 10 senior
executives from major Hong Kong banks, manufacturers, traders and
service providers.

<HEADLINE> SW China Province Bans Smoking in Capital's Public Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province in southwest China,
which is a major tobacco producer, instituted a ban on smoking in
public places in its capital Kunming today.
</P>
<P>
At Kunming Railway Station, one man who said he has been
smoking for 30 years was stopped by staff members there when he
took out a cigarette and was told that anyone caught smoking in a
public place will face stiff penalties.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of Yunnan's revenue comes from the tobacco
industry, which has been doing very well since the mid-80s. The
percentage of local people who smoke is higher than in some other
parts of China.
</P>
<P>
In Kunming and other provincial cities that are known for their
scenery, smoking has bothered many visitors from outside the
province. So, the ban on smoking is a way to create a clean,
comfortable and healthy social environment, said Zhang Chenggui, a
city government official.
</P>
<P>
The smoking ban covers waiting rooms at airports, ports,
railway and bus stations, recreation centers, sports centers,
education areas, and large shops. Some government and non-
government organizations and military departments will also be
affected.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that they will still need to strengthen the
publicity campaign and law enforcement to really make the ban take
effect.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Reaffirms "One China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose
Rangel Monday reiterated that Venezuela recognizes only one China
and will under no circumstances acknowledge any form of "One China,
One Taiwan" or Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception to welcome a Chinese delegation headed
by Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Cao Zhi, Rangel
said Venezuela is a real friend to China and hopes to maintain the
best relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He said the human rights issue is an important aspect of
Venezuelan internal and foreign policies. However, Venezuela
rejects any hypocritical toying of the sensitive issue and that's
why it voted in favor of China, Cuba and Iran at the U.N. Human
Rights Session.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that Venezuelan President Hugo Chaves
will visit China soon. He also said he welcomes Chinese
investment in his country, saying that China has abundant
investment opportunities in Venezuela and has an equally important
market for Venezuelan products.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that both countries could enhance their political ties,
economic and trade relations as well as cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhi shared Rangel's view. He said both countries have
great potential for economic cooperation. He also thanked
Venezuela's for pursuing the "One China" policy and its support to
China on the U.N. Human Rights Session.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that Taiwan is an integral part of China and
expressed the belief that China-Venezuela friendship and
cooperation will continue to develop as a result of increasing
political contacts and economic cooperation, particularly through
such high-level contacts as President Chaves' impending visit to
China.
</P>
<P>
Cao arrived here on Saturday after winding up his visit to
Colombia. He is scheduled to continue his Latin American tour to
Cuba and Jamaica on Tuesday.

CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on Tuesday
called on Israel to make a fresh drive in an effort to push the
Middle East peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa, EU Mideast envoy Miguel Moratinos expressed
EU's hope that the future would witness no crisis pertaining to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hopes of reviving the Arab-Israeli peace talks increased after
Israel's moderate Ehud Barak defeated hardline Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in the country's May 17 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Little progress has been made in the peace negotiations since
Netanyahu came to power in 1996 due to his intransigent policies.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos reiterated the importance of the role played by both
Egypt and the EU in the peace march, saying that the EU plans to
shoulder its responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European organization is ready to help smooth
away any obstacles that impede the realization of peace in the
Middle East, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which desires to play a key role in the Mideast peace
process, keeps close contacts with Egypt, the first Arab country
to sign a peace treaty with Israel and an active mediator in the
Arab-Israeli peacemaking.

<TEXT>
<P>
The board will pay special attention to industrial and
commercial administration, environmental protection, construction,
quality supervision, transport, and water conservation fees as
well.
</P>
<P>
The central government will have new national inspections of
fees local authorities levy on enterprises this year and will not
approve any new fees.
</P>
<P>
An SETC official says that these fees can be attributed to
problems in the distribution of revenues by the central and local
governments. At present, all tax revenues other than income tax go
directly to the central government. So, to increase revenues
without central government controls, local governments levy
administrative fees on enterprises and individuals.
</P>
<P>
This has eroded tax revenue base and has led to serious
defaults in tax payments by enterprises. But, over the past 12
months, the central government has removed almost all local fee
authority from local governments. It is trying to turn local fees
into taxes as soon as possible to establish new treasury and tax
systems that meet the demands of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuanzhi, the deputy director of the SETC's Enterprise
Supervision Department, says that in the next few weeks the
government will publish 10 major examples of local authorities
charging illegal fees, in the media.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Stopping Excessive Levies on Enterprises (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- To make sure that Chinese and
foreign enterprises don't end up paying the nearly 100 billion
yuan in excessive fees that local authorities charge every year,
the Chinese government is cracking down on unreasonable fee
schemes this year.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, it has stopped these fees in 26,710
cases where government departments and local authorities were
charging enterprises and individuals by cutting the annual
revenues of these departments by 98.5 billion yuan (12 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government ferreted out more than 18,000 cases of such
charges and penalized 1,273 government officials or staff members
who were involved, confiscating 240 million yuan in illegal fees.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Zheng Silin, the vice-minister of the
State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), the effects of these
measures should not be overestimated and they will take time to
make their effect felt and some areas are still levying illegal
fees.
</P>
<P>
SETC and five other ministries have formed a joint board to
deal with these burdens and it has decided that, based on their
work in the electric power, railway, and public security sectors
last year, it will focus on eliminating unreasonable agent service
fees this year. Some government departments have shifted their
duties to agents that they sponsored and charged fees through the
agents on services that they were supposed to provide to the
public for free.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Modernize Its Maritime Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Monday night his administration is committed to supporting
the modernization of the country's maritime industry and making
the Philippines a major shipbuilding center in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 25th anniversary of the Maritime Industry
Authority (Marina) at the Presidential Palace, Estrada said he
will back up efforts of Marina to propose changes in the
Philippine ship mortgage law to facilitate the acquisition of new
vessels.
</P>
<P>
The president said he would direct government agencies
concerned to immediately sit down with Marina so that amendments
in policies and regulations, where necessary, can be drawn up and
implemented as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We will strengthen our maritime industry to enable it to face
and match the challenges of the future," the president emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Paying tribute to the maritime industry's foreign exchange
contributions to the economy worth 1.5 billion U.S. dollars which
representing the 6th largest dollar remittance for the past five
years, the president said the Filipino seafarers are the
modern-day heroes.
</P>
<P>
With the deregulation of the shipping industry, Estrada said so
many routes are now being opened to Philippine ships. "In the
years to come, we can compete with the shipbuilding capabilities
of our neighbors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, he said, can also be proud that at the
beginning of the 1990s, its overseas shipping had one of the
world's largest fleets together with Greece, Japan, the United
States, Russia and Norway.

<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Chi Haotian, in a
meeting with the Chief of the General Staff of the Romanian Armed
Forces Constin Degeratu today, criticized some U.S. politicians of
irresponsibility in cooking up stories to destroy Sino-U.S.
relations and China's image.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what the Cox Report says, China has worked entirely
on its own to achieve success in a number of efforts from nuclear
weapons to high-tech research, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
He also elaborated on the Chinese government's principled stand
on the Kosovo crisis and the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy
and extended his thanks to Romania for its help in evacuating some
Chinese citizens from Yugoslavia at that time.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that Degeratu's visit is a major event in
bilateral relations and will further promote friendship and
cooperation between the armed forces of China and Romania.
</P>
<P>
Degeratu said that Romania will never forget China's support
and help during its most difficult time and that Romania has
always advocated a peaceful settlement of the Kosovo crisis
through political channels and hopes that NATO will stop its
military interference in Yugoslavia as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> British Government Denies GM Rift with Prince Charles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The British government denied on
Tuesday that it disagreed with Prince Charles over genetically
modified food, after the heir to the throne questioned its safety.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he (Prince Charles) is embarrassing the
government. I think he's raising issues which deserve to be
raised," Environment Minister Michael Meacher said in an interview
with BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
"There are 10 questions in his article, all of them entirely
fair questions. The government is trying to give answers to them.
We're not trying to duck it. We're not trying to evade. We want
the evidence to be put on the table," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an article for Tuesday's Daily Mail, Prince Charles
questioned claims that contend genetically-modified foods are safe.
</P>
<P>
"Do we really need GM food in this country?" asked Charles. "
On the basis of what we have seen so far, we don't appear to need
it at all."
</P>
<P>
Meacher also defended the government's position on genetically-
modified foods, saying the government would not force GM foods "
down people's throats" and would not put public health at risk.
</P>
<P>
However, the environmental group Friends of the Earth, which
has led public opposition of GM foods, said Charles's comments in
the Daily Mail were a blow to the government.
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted by the prince's article," said the group's
director, Charles Secrett. "It's about time the government took
account of the overwhelming tide of opinion on GM foods."
</P>
<P>
Opponents of GM foods and crops claim their long-term safety
and environmental impact have not been assessed, leading to calls
for a moratorium on crop growing until more is known.
</P>
<P>
But the government is keen to exploit the multi-million pound
market, saying GM foods could lead to cheaper and better tasting
foods.

<HEADLINE> Mideast, Caspian Cooperation Vital for Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) Tuesday urged the Middle East and the Caspian
Sea region to cooperate in the energy field to bring about a
stable oil market.
</P>
<P>
"The two regions can complement each other and cooperate in
the energy field in order to achieve stability in the oil market
and improve revenues for the oil producing countries," UAE
Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Obeid Bin Saif Al
Nasir said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks at the opening session of the 6th
International Caspian Oil and Gas Exhibition and Conference, which
opened Tuesday at Baku, Azerbaijan, UAE official WAM news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Oil production from non-OPEC (Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries) regions would stabilize and then decline in
the coming decades, and consequently, most of the oil supply to
meet future demand growth should come from the Middle East and
other newly developed areas such as the Caspian Sea region, Nasir
said.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the two regions could play a key role in
meeting the future world demand for energy, and therefore,
cooperation between the two regions in the field was vital for the
stability of the oil market, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister predicted that the current oil supply glut may
not last long and demand for oil will go up in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The world will successfully overcome current and future
economic crises and the oil market situation will continue
improving, enhanced by cooperation among producing countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the world's need for commercial energy is
expected to grow by about 21 percent in the next 10 years and by
nearly 41 percent in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the demand for oil could rise by 17 percent in the
10 years to come and by 32 percent in the next 20 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to natural gas, forecasts indicated even faster
growth rates, reaching nearly 35 percent and 65 percent by 2010
and 2020 respectively, he added.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has the world's third largest oil reserves, which stand
at 98 billion barrels, and the fourth largest natural gas proven
reserves of 6 trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is expected to undertake major developments in oil and
natural gas sectors in the future in view of the disparity
existing between reserves and production levels, the minister
said.

<HEADLINE> Romania Launches Project to Develop Rural Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government is
planning a nation-wide program to improve schooling and
educational facilities in backward rural areas, the local daily
Nine O'clock reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program, jointly financed by local authorities, government
allocations, and the World Bank, is aimed at providing more modern
educational opportunities to children living in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
There are already a number of projects under way that benefit
from co-financing on the part of the Romanian government and the
World Bank, including a mini-pilot project for the promotion or
rural information and training centers in five rural settlements
in different counties.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the education in rural schools has continued
to decline because of insufficient funding and the exodus of
teachers' to larger towns. The pupils from the rural area
represent almost half of Romania's school population, but as many
as 40 percent of them do not receive equal opportunity in
education compared to children living in towns.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Success Story of Thai Tourist Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A 7.5 percent increase in terms of
foreign tourist arrivals in Thailand at a time when the country's
gross domestic product slumped by 8 percent marked the success of
Thailand's tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
Pitak Intrawityanunt, minister of the Prime Minister's Office
and top administrator of the tourist industry in Thailand, talked
about the secret recipe of the largest single industry in the
country in an interview with Xinhua on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The success of the industry lies in the marketing mix:
products, prices, promotions and places, which are necessary to
compete in the world market, Pitak said.
</P>
<P>
"We have historic sights in the North, and scenic beaches in
the South. We have modern metropolis like Bangkok, and we also
have well-protected forests in some remote areas," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"With these diversified destinations, we can serve tourists
with different needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for prices, the currency devaluation which sparked the
financial crisis in mid 1997 made Thailand a much cheaper
destination than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
But, as officials of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)
once said that Thai hotels will do nothing that would in any way
reduce the quality of visitors' experience in spite of the
floatation of the baht and pricing pressure.
</P>
<P>
The proof was a survey of "The World's Best Value" holiday
spots published by Travel and Leisure Magazine in March 1999,
which showed that hotels, cities and resorts in Thailand scored
top marks.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok was rated the seventh-best value for money city in the
world, while Phuket, the famous island resort in southern
Thailand, the fourth-best value for money resort.
</P>
<P>
Thai hotels scored particularly well in the survey, with the
Oriental ranking the top value hotel in the world and three other
luxury hotels in Thailand being included in the top five spots in
the category of best value Asian hotels.
</P>
<P>
Promotional campaign is one of the most important parts of the
tourist industry in Thailand. The "Amazing Thailand 1998-1999"
campaign is so successful that the TAT is considering using the
slogan, which, according to Pitak, seems to have been known to
everyone, in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
As part of the "Amazing Thailand" campaign, TAT took advantage
of the rich Thai tradition to introduce various festivals, such as
Water Lantern Festival and Songkran (Water-Splashing) Festival,
whose exoticism foreign visitors find hard to forget.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, another Grand Sale month began in Thailand with the
participation of leading department stores and famous antique and
jewelry shops. The semi-annual campaign is aimed to lure shoppers
from around the world and make Bangkok a regional shopping center.
</P>
<P>
The country is also trying to make Bangkok, the capital, a
world conference center by spending 85 million baht (2.3 million
U.S. dollars) on hosting a number of international conferences.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Success Story of Thai Tourist Industry (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In addition to the marketing mix, Pitak attributed the success
of Thai tourism to the world-class services, stable political
situation and satisfactory public security.
</P>
<P>
"I know that a lot of Japanese girls come to Thailand not only
for sightseeing. They stay here long to learn make-up, cooking
skills," the minister said, "And they feel that Thailand is a safe
and friendly place with nothing to be afraid of."
</P>
<P>
Pitak also said that in a modern society, people are faced with
fierce competition in their working days.
</P>
<P>
"When they are on vacation, they want to be in a relaxing and
pleasant environment, which Thailand can provide with," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand is called 'Land of Smile'," Pitak said, "You can
enjoy world-class services here."
</P>
<P>
Thailand is bragging of the achievement of luring 7.79 million
foreigner tourists to the country and earning 265 billion baht
(6.39 billion dollars) from them in the second year when the whole
region was mired in the economic slump.
</P>
<P>
The TAT expected another big increase of 7 percent in foreign
tourist arrivals in 1999 to 8.2 million with tourism earnings
reaching 300 billion baht (8.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
To meet that target, Pitak said no market, no matter how small
it is, can be spared to loose.
</P>
<P>
He said he will lead a high-level public and private sector
delegation to visit East Europe to boost tourist arrivals from
this region.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern European market has shown visible growth of 39.4
percent to 48,464 arrivals in 1998 from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
China is another market that TAT attaches greater importance,
which, with world's largest population, has become the fourth
biggest market for Thai tourism with its 600,000 visitors in 1998,
Pitak said.
</P>
<P>
The minister expected to see a rapid growth in Chinese tourists
in Thailand to 800,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Within three years, China will become the largest market for
Thai tourism," he said.
</P>
<P>
As Thailand's largest single industry and the only one to have
seen major growth since the economic recession, tourism is
expected to create around 4 million jobs by the end of this year.
And by the year 2010, the number is predicted to grow to 5.6
million, Pitak said.
</P>
<P>
What's more, tourism revenue is expected to account for 13
percent of the country's total revenue this year.
</P>
<P>
"The government has realized that developing tourist industry
is an effective way to help revive the Thai economy," Pitak said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Parents Shop for Educational Toys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Parents throughout China visited
stores today to find toys to give their children to mark today's
celebrations of International Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
However, a recent survey revealed that some 60 percent of
Chinese parents are far less than satisfied with available toys
and expect stores to introduce new items.
</P>
<P>
The Science Times recently carried the results of a survey
showing that only six percent of parents were satisfied with the
current toy market.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of respondents voiced their preference for
imported toys, especially items featuring cartoon figures. Experts
conducting the survey noted that people prefer the attractive
appearance and high-tech aspects of foreign toys and in turn tend
to avoid purchases of traditional Chinese toys.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 67 percent of responding parents prefer to
buy educational toys, with 60 percent citing a preference to toy
bricks. Over 70 percent expressed they dislike for toys which are
simply fun, but lack any educational value.
</P>
<P>
Experts say this particular factor shows the different
education concepts between parents in China and in western
countries. Chinese parents hope to improve the cleverness of their
children even in play situations.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that 71 percent of Chinese parents consider
the educational value of toys prior to making a purchase, with
some 66 percent placing great consideration on price.
</P>
<P>
Domestically manufactured toys such as dolls are popular on
international markets. Some 50 percent of toys sold in the United
States and 80 percent in Australia were manufactured in China.
Nonetheless, the domestic toy market is far from saturated.

<HEADLINE> 3 Syrian Workers Wounded in Israeli Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Three Syiran workers were wounded
Tuesday in Israeli air raids on Lebanese guerrillas' targets in
south Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted security sources as saying that Israeli
warplanes fired several missiles on Hezbollah guerrilla's
strongholds in Iqlim Toufah, north of the Israeli occupied border
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A missile hit a parking plot in the area where three Syrian
workders were wounded, the sources said, adding that they have
been sent to hospitals in Sidon, the country's largest coastal
city in the south.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli raids came hours after Hezbollah killed a member
of Israel's allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) and wounded another by
detonating two separate roadside bombs in Jezzine as the militia
is in the process of departing the town.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting to
oust Israeli occupation forces and SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA is financed and trained by Israel to help
patrol the occupied zone. It also controls Jezzine, a pocket
north of the Israeli occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, SLA's commander Gen. Antoine Lahd announced to pull
his troops out of Jezzine, saying the town is very dangerous to
hold.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 SLA militiamen have been killed and about 400
others wounded in Jezzine over the past 14 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Lahd's plan, the pull-out has formally started
since Monday night and will be over by mid-June.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri

NAIROBI , June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Shell Oil Company has taken
over state- owned oil company, Petro-Rwanda, Jean Pierre
Rubulika, managing director of the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Nineteen Petro Stations in different prefectures of Rwanda
will be taken over by Shell", Rubulika said.
</P>
<P>
According to the head of the National Privatization Secretariat
in Rwanda , Vianney Shumbusho, the approval for the sale of the
petro stations was given by the government and will cost 2.1
million U.S. dollars, according to Rwanda News Agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The sale of the company's assets stems from the heavy losses
that have always been incurred, the company owes the government
an outstanding debt of about 4 billion dollars as indicated by
the accounts of December 1998," Shumbusho highlighted. "The
company has more liabilities than assets," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile over 160 oil company workers who were sacked early
this year vowed to sue the company and the government for failure
to pay their six months wages.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmer Rescued After 9 Hours in A Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A farmer in the northeastern
Chinese coastal city of Dalian was rescued this weekend after
being buried for nine hours down in a well whose walls caved in.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday afternoon, Fu Cheng, a 31-year-old man from a
village in Jinzhou District of Dalian, was caught 10 meters down
in a well while he was down getting water and the walls collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Local police came to the rescue and an excavator was sent for.
The machine began digging the earth from around the well, while
villagers and policemen hauled away stones. But, in the process,
there was another cave-in, making the rescue work more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Finally, at about one in the morning, Fu could be faintly heard
groaning down below and he was pulled out of the well about an
hour later.
</P>
<P>
He is now reported to be in good condition after receiving
emergency medical treatment.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Likely to Invest 1.78b Dollars to Install Telephones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government and the
private sector are likely to invest around 86.5 billion taka
(about 1.78 billion U.S. dollars) to install 877,500 new
telephones across the country in the next three years, an English
daily newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government has floated international tenders for 0.3
million phones on "build, own and operate" basis in private
sector, The Financial Express quoted Post and Telecommunications
Secretary Nazmul Ahsan Chowdhury as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government has also agreed in principle to install 50,000
wireless loop telephones by the private sector and 0.2 million
more in collaboration with the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone
Board and Japanese private sector, and the total private sector's
investment will be around 32 billion taka (about 659.8 million
dollars), according to the secretary.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations with China and Japan are going on to install
18,900 phones in 58 districts and 0.2 million personal handy
system phones in the city respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
The remaining work of installing 50,000 phones is going on in
Dhaka city, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government will invest 54.5 billion taka (about 1.12
billion dollars) for installation of the new phones, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
At present, the existing tele-density in this South Asian
country is only 0.24 per 100 people against 78 in India, 61 in
Pakistan and 90 in Sri Lanka, and it means that Bangladesh has
only one telephone for 418 people, according a report.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh invests in the telecommunications sector only 0.9
dollar per inhabitant when India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka invest
1.94, 4.40 and 13.1 dollars respectively, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The low investment is one of the prime reason for backwardness
of telecommunications in the country, it pointed out.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Usable Foreign Currency Reserve Hits New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's usable foreign currency
reserve rose to 58.73 billion U.S. dollars at the end of May, up 2.
35 billion dollars from April, according to the Bank of Korea (BOK)
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If the foreign currency deposits at the overseas branches of
South Korean banks are included, the total of usable foreign
currencies will stand at 61.41 billion U.S. dollars, up 2.15
billion dollars from April.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the increase in foreign currency
reserve to another current account surplus and additional inflows
of foreign capital for corporate and financial restructuring in
May.
</P>
<P>
Last month, one billion U.S. dollars in restructuring funds was
transferred from the World Bank together with an inflow of 240
million dollars in loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
.
</P>
<P>
South Korean foreign currency holdings were once down to less
than four billion U.S. dollars in November 1997 when the nation
borrowed 58 billion U.S. dollars from the IMF after it was gripped
by a financial crisis triggered by corporate bankruptcies and bad
loans of financial institutions in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said that in the second half, the improvement
of foreign currency reserves will slow due to outstanding payments
to overseas creditors including the IMF.

<HEADLINE> South China Sea Fishing Ban Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Several dozen fishing boats
remained berthed today in south China's Lotus Mountain Fish Harbor,
with a sign at the entrance to the wharf clearly announcing -- "
Fishing Ban Begins Today".
</P>
<P>
Chen Caizai, a fisherman in his 50s, was fully aware of the ban,
but nonetheless arrived at the wharf early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
"Fishing has provided a livelihood for generations of my family
and fishing bans were unheard of until now. I know the ban is
designed to protect aquatic resources and must be taken seriously,
" said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he will repair his trawler and nets during the two-
month moratorium.
</P>
<P>
China's first-ever fishing ban in the South China which will
run through July 31 and will cover one million sq.km. are north to
12 degrees of north latitude.
</P>
<P>
The ban will affect about 300,000 people and 21,000 fishing
boats in south China's Guangdong and Hainan provinces, and the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The South China Sea, the nation's largest territorial sea area,
enjoys tropical weather and is an ideal fishing ground. Aquatic
resource, however, have shown traces of depletion to overfishing.
</P>
<P>
An investigation carried out by research vessel "Big Dipper"
since December 1997 shows that the density of aquatic resources in
the area has dropped to only 14 percent of the level in 1978, with
the effects readily obvious in six successive fishing seasons.
</P>
<P>
Huang Liangmin, director of the South China Sea Marine Research
Institute under Chinese Academy of Sciences, attributed the
problem to human activities, including the dumping of waste and
reclaiming land from the sea.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics suggest that the number of motorized
fishing boats operating in the South China Sea has grown 10.4-fold,
or 67,000 units, over the past 20 years. The annual harvest of
aquatic products reached 3.7 million tons, a level substantially
above the estimated sustainable maximum of 2.5-2.8 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Local officials note that the fishing ban was enacted during
the spawning cycle for cash fish and will reduce the annual
harvest in the South China Sea by 16-17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Provinces in south China have engaged in an active effort to
better protect aquatic resources and are committed to introducing
advanced fishing methods, including the introduction of a global
positioning system to locate fish shoals, and introducing harsh
penalties for fishermen who engage in hazardous activities such as
introducing electric shocks and dynamiting.
</P>
<P>
Huang pointed out that it will take at least 2-3 years to
determine the effectiveness of the ban.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture began to ban fishing in Summer in
the East China and Yellow seas since 1995, and plans to extend the
moratorium period and no-fishing zone on the latter during 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel's transport market
officially switched to the use of the 0.05 percent low-sulphur
diesel fuel Tuesday in an effort to reduce air pollution,
</P>
<P>
Environmental officials said the switch is to reduce levels of
air pollution by motor vehicles, especially in populated areas,
according to the Globes business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
By using low-sulphur diesel oil, air pollution can be reduced
by 30 percent, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Egged Company, the biggest bus company in Israel, said it
has already finished the transition to the use of low-sulphur
diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
Environmental officials said Israel must work to make further
improvement in fuel products within a few years in order to catch

<HEADLINE> China's Drug Exports Grow but Problems Remain, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China witnessed growth in the
export of medicines in the first quarter this year but intensive
efforts are still required to solve problems that would otherwise
hamper the future development of drug exports, industry sources
have warned.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China exported 36,107 tons of drugs valued
at 370 million U.S. dollars during the three-month period,
respective 28 percent and three percent increases from one year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
However, behind the increase are problems including lack of
technology-intensive products, pollution caused by pharmaceutical
enterprises and decrease in the export of patented traditional
Chinese medicines.
</P>
<P>
Raw materials and preparations, including antibiotics, vitamins,
hormones and medicinal herbs, accounted for the bulk of drug
exports in the January-March period, while high-tech products such
as biopharmaceutical products only accounted 5.5 percent, or 3.65
million dollars, of the total, according to Monday's edition of
the International Business Daily.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the growth in the production of vitamins and
other medicines for more exports has also exacerbated
environmental pollution in where the factories are situated,
giving a negative impact on the health of local residents.
</P>
<P>
Another major problem is the drop in exports of patented
traditional Chinese medicines in recent years as low prices for
such export products have prompted many enterprises to shift their
production of traditional Chinese medicine to more profitable
Western drugs.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders have called for greater efforts to develop
new and high-tech drugs with greater competitiveness on
international markets. They have also called for strengthened
controls regarding the development and production scale of
products likely to create pollution.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Tuesday took a cautious
stand over Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's apparent
acceptance of a Group of Eight peace plan and insisted that NATO
must lead any peacekeeping force for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It remains to be seen what he's actually accepted," Defense
Secretary George Robertson said in an interview to the Sky
television.
</P>
<P>
"We've made it absolutely clear that our bottom line is that
all Serb troops will leave Kosovo and that there will be an
international security force with NATO at its core," he said.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made as Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari,
the European Union's Balkans envoy, was due to meet his Russian
counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin and U.S. diplomat Strobe Talbott
in Bonn on Tuesday for talks on the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
After meeting in Bonn, Ahtisaari and Chernomyrdin were then due
to fly into Belgrade on Wednesday to meet Milosevic, who the
Yugoslav official Tanjug news agency said had accepted in
principle the G-8 peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The G-8, consisting of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the
United States, Japan, Canada and Russia, initiated a peace plan
last month which aimed at ending the bombing on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said Belgrade's acceptance of some sort of
international force for Kosovo was "a sign of progress."

CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Several leading economic indicators have showed
noticeable improvement in Israel's economy in the first four
months, but experts said it remained in a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
According to a report carried by the Haaretz daily Tuesday,
the industrial production rose 1 percent in February and March,
compared with a 1-2 percent decline from October last year
through January this year.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment remained steady at 8.6 percent, or about 190,000
workforces, throughout the first quarter, slightly up from 8.5
percent during the second half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales rose 10 percent in March, following a 7
percent rise in January and 9 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
In the mean time, the consumer price index (CPI) rose by
0.3 percent in April, the lowest growth rate in the past 35
years for the month of April.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the low CPI growth is a good indication
that the economy is heading for a year of stable prices. They
estimate that inflation for this year may be lower than the
government's projection of 4 percent. Inflation stood at 8.6
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has approved the
1999 state budget, in which expenditure was set at 6.242 billion
U.S. dollars and revenues were at 5.566 billion dollars, with a
deficit of 676 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
UAE Minister of State for Financial and Industrial Affairs
Mohammed Khalfan Kharbash said the government will not resort to
borrowing to reduce the deficit, the Arabic daily Al Hayat
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new budget reveals an increase in social welfare and
service projects and it is expected to be enforced as soon as
getting sanction from the president.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development
will provide Syria with a loan of 30 million Kuwaiti dinars (100
million dollars) to finance its communications development
projects.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Minister of State for Planning Affairs Abdel Rahim Al
Soubel and General Manager of the Arab fund Abdul Latif Al Hamad
have signed an agreement to this effect, the Al Hayat reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the projects aim at improving local,
regional and international telephone services, and meeting the
rising demand of the roughly 1.65 million subscribers in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The project covers establishing new exchanges, expanding the
existing ones and building a digital, microwave and optical
network to link rural districts to principal exchanges and extend
cable networks for local subscribers in various governorates.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- As of June 1, Saudi Arabia will collect
departure fees on travelers who depart from Saudi airports as a

<HEADLINE> Macao, Guangdong Officials Hold Meeting on Border Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Macao-Guangdong Border Affairs
Coordination Group held its annual meeting here on today to
strengthen the cooperation between the two places in combating
cross-border crimes and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Domingos Fezas Vital, an advisor to the Macao governor and head
of the Macao delegation to the meeting, said that information
exchanges have been much improved in recent years and the two
sides have made marked achievements in jointly fighting crimes.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Macao is a small place with a population of over
400,000. Due to convenient border crossing, however, some 30
million persons traversed the border connecting Macao with
Guangdong Province in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we need the help and cooperation from our
neighboring area," Vital said. "The meeting enhanced mutual trust
and we have full confidence in the cooperative measures in the
future."
</P>
<P>
Chao Zhenwei, deputy secretary-general of the Guangdong
provincial government and head of the Guangdong delegation, said
after the meeting that the two sides reviewed the work in the past
year and discussed issues of common concern "with a sincere
attitude."
</P>
<P>
Chao said that the coordination and contact between Guangdong
and Macao will be carried on even after China resumes the
sovereignty over Macao on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two sides also agreed to clean up the
waters surrounding Macao to ensure better shipping.
</P>
<P>
The coordination group was set up in 1987, and annual meetings
have been held in Macao and Guangdong by turns.

<HEADLINE> Macao Jobless Rate Sets New Record of 6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Macao's unemployment rate between
February and April of this year stood at six percent, the highest
in the 1990s, and 0.3 percentage point higher than that in the
January-March period this year, the latest official statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
As compared with the same period in 1998, the February-April
period jobless rate was 2.4 percentage points higher, according to
figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the underemployment rate in the period remained
unchanged at 1.2 percent in comparison with the first three months
of this year, and down 0.3 percentage point from the February-
April period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Local economists pointed out that the government does not have
a good plan in the near future to pull down the high jobless rate,
and Macao has been affected by overall economic depression over
the past few years. To be worse, new graduates in the summer may
push the rate even higher.
</P>
<P>
One of the stopgap measures should be fewer workers introduced
from outside Macao, a local labor union leader noted.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Urges Social Stability (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Wednesday edition of People's
Daily, China's flagship newspaper, will carry an editorial calling
for an unswerving effort to ensure social stability.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that the U.S.-led NATO attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade exposed the fact that anti-China
hostile forces in the West have never abandoned their scheme to
ruin China. It notes that the attack was designed to disturb
China's unity and stability, and disrupt the nation's sound
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The ulterior motives of the atrocity committed by U.S.-led NATO
was aimed to challenge the degree of China's social stability and
the Chinese Government and people have condemned and responded
with a powerful counterblow against the sinister design of the
criminal act, according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
People throughout the nation have expressed a common will to
ensure China's stability. China needs development and China must
remain strong. China must steadfastly avoid letting a disturbance
created by outside forces spark internal chaos.
</P>

return from the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, President Jiang
Zemin called for China to unswervingly maintain social stability
in order to guarantee the completion of various reform and
modernization tasks.

Party and people from all ethnic groups across the country," the
editorial says.
</P>
<P>
"Stability is extremely important for Chinese people who are
focusing on the reform, opening and socialist modernization drive,
" says the editorial, adding that nothing can be accomplished
without political stability and unity.

stability and unity must be stopped resolutely in the embryonic
stage.
</P>
<P>
China, a nation bullied by western powers throughout history,

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Discusses Mideast Peace with Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa held talks with Lebanese leaders here on Tuesday on the
latest developments in the Middle East peace process and the
situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard now to judge the future of peace talks with Israel
in the Middle East," al-Sharaa told a news conference following
his meeting with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Prime
Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
"We can know Israel's real intentions about reviving
negotiations (with Syria and Lebanon) from where they broke off
only after the formation of (Prime Minister-elect Ehud) Barak's
government is completed," said al-Sharaa, who came here by land
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Labor Party leader Barak defeated outgoing Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the May 17 elections and has
pledged to reopen peace talks with Syria and withdraw Israeli
troops from south Lebanon within a year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, peace talks on Syria and Lebanon
tracks have been in a standstill as Netanyahu refused to return
Golan Heights to Syria and to unconditionally withdraw from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria, a main power broker in Lebanon, has been insisting that
Syrian and Lebanese tracks not be separated and be carried out
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
been spearheading a war of attrition to oust the Israeli
occupation troops and their allied South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militia out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on SLA's ongoing withdrawal from Jezzine, an enclave
just north of the security zone, al-Sharaa said the pullback would
not bring any affect on Hezbollah in liberating south Lebanon and
also on Syrian-Lebanese joint stance on peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The SLA militia began to withdraw on Tuesday from Jezzine,
which it has held for 14 years, due to rising casualties caused by
Hezbollah's attacks.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA, established in 1985, are trained and
financed by Israeli troops to help them patrol the border zone.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, al-Sharaa also delivered a message from
Syiran President Hafaz Assad to Lahoud, whose details were not
disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Canada Acts to Reduce Gas-Pump Spills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Environment Minister
Christine Stewart has proposed new regulations that would slow the
flow of gasoline at the pumps to reduce spills and emissions.
</P>
<P>
The proposed regulations would limit the flow of gasoline to a
maximum of 38 liters a minute. There is currently no national
standard in the country. According to industry officials, the
average pump speed is 40 liters per minute, but some pumps can
reach 52 liters per minute.
</P>
<P>
"These regulations ensure less toxic emissions in our air and
less spilling of gasoline into our ground," Stewart said in a
press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
The environmental benefits of the regulations are a modest, but
crucial, first step to cutting toxic emissions, according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Faster flow rates increase the chances of spills as the tank
fills up, and also increase emissions of volatile organic
compounds, which are a major contributor to urban smog.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline also contains benzene, which has been linked to cancer.
The government estimates that emissions from gas-station fill-ups
are responsible for about 6 percent of the daily intake of benzene
by adult Canadians.
</P>
<P>
Environment Canada said the proposed regulations will eliminate
two million liters a year in spills by 2001, decreasing the number
of volatile organic compounds released by 1,500 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
The amount of benzene released will drop by an estimated 15
tons a year, and will also save Canadians about one million
Canadian dollars (680,000 U.S. dollars) in fuel costs annually,
the department said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and the European Commission
have announced a joint communique in Abuja Monday on re-starting
their development cooperation following Nigeria's return to civil
rule.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the European Union's executive branch,
 expressed its intention to focus the cooperation on the fight
against poverty, promotion of democracy and good governance,
anti-corruption measures and the full integration of Nigeria in
the global economy through promotion of trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The document was released after the EU lifted all sanctions
against Nigeria the same day.
</P>
<P>
About 495 million U.S. dollars allocated to Nigeria under the
Fourth Lome Convention before 1995 can now be renegotiated,
according to the communique.
</P>
<P>
In addition, negotiations can also be opened on the use of the
new allocation which could be made available to Nigeria, said the
communique issued after discussions by the commission with
Nigerian representatives, the Daily Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to adopt a twin-track approach under which a
"quick- start package" of programs will start in 1999 while the
medium-to-long-term cooperation activities will be agreed on after
the results of a comprehensive programing study are reached.
</P>
<P>
The European Union abolished in October 1998 most of the
sanctions it adopted in 1995 because of the human rights
violations by late General Sani Abacha regime of that time.
</P>
<P>
Until now, however, development cooperation has been limited to
actions in support of human rights and democracy as well as the
activities concentrating on poverty alleviation in the framework
of decentralized cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Until 1995, Nigeria was the EU's largest development
cooperation partner with a total of 1.5 billion dollars allocated
to Nigeria under the four successive Lome Conventions since 1975.

<HEADLINE> Mass Hartal Held Against Tamil Rebels in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan Tamil political party
on Tuesday organized a mass hartal in the northern Jaffna
peninsula to protest against a series of violence unleashed by the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) said
that destabilization of civil administration in the peninsula by
the LTTE is another reason for the hartal.
</P>
<P>
"Except the hospital and pharmacies, all shops, schools,
government and private institutions will be closed. It is a
peaceful protest to highlight the anger of the civilians against
the LTTE," said the leader of the EPDP and Jaffna district
parliamentarian Douglas Devananda.
</P>
<P>
Devananda accused the LTTE of going all out to destroy the
civil administration and the day-to-day life of the innocent
Jaffna civilians.
</P>
<P>
He said: "So far in the past one year the organization has
killed 12 EPDP members and among them five were members of the
local government bodies in the peninsula."
</P>
<P>
He added that it was for the first time that a mass hartal was
organized in Jaffna peninsula, the former stronghold of the LTTE,
to protest against the LTTE since the civil administration was
re-established in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a drawn-out war against the Sri
Lankan government since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the
north and east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Ban Japanese Fishing Boats Over Tuna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia will ban Japanese
fishing boats from Australian ports and fishing zones following
Japan's decision to ignore international quotas on threatened
Southern Bluefin Tuna.
</P>
<P>
Japan has announced it will again conduct an "experimental
fishing program" for the tuna - the same method it used last year
to take 1,400 tons or 25 percent above its quota.
</P>
<P>
Japan's announcement has prompted an angry reaction from
Australia, member of the Commission for the Conservation of
Southern Bluefin Tuna.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is totally unacceptable and we are protesting
in the strongest possible terms," Australian Agriculture Minister
Mark Vaile told reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"(Australian) Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has called in
the Japanese Ambassador this evening to express those strong
concerns.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely disappointing. It is flying in the face of
Japan's international obligations under the International Law of
the Sea."
</P>
<P>
Vaile said Japan's continued overfishing of the highly prized
tuna was threatening an Australian export industry worth 110
million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Vaile said Australia was considering taking legal action
against Japan and would pursue the issue through international
forums and treaties.

<HEADLINE> Passive Smoking Affects 600 Million Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Health experts warn that harmful
tobacco smoke adversely affects one in every two Chinese citizens,
especially women and children.
</P>
<P>
Passive smoke has emerged as a common health problem in China
and an estimated 600 million people are regularly subjected to
second-hand smoke, according to Professor He Yao, managing
director of the Chinese Association on Smoking and Health.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a passive smoker as
an individual who inhales cigarette smoke for 15 minutes or longer
at least one day each week.
</P>
<P>
The overall nationwide rate for passive smoking has reached 52.
5 percent, with the rate rising to 57 percent for females and as
high as 70 percent for career women between 20-49. Some 71 percent
of homes, 32.5 percent of public venues and 25 percent of work
places lack smoke-free environment.
</P>
<P>
He, a professor with the Geriatric Institute under the People's
Liberation Army General Hospital, stressed that numerous studies
confirm that passive smoking is harmful to human health and
leading cause of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Males account for the majority of China's 320 million smokers.
Cigarettes currently claim the lives of 2,000 Chinese people daily
and the number is expected to climb to 8,000 per day or three
million annually by the middle of the next century if current
smoking patterns persist, according to a joint Chinese and foreign
study of tobacco-related deaths in China.

"In my view it needs at least ten years to beat them," the
referee stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Because of their dominance in height and jump, the Europeans
can play high ball and power game, that is why they can score
points easily," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The height is not everything but is a main factor in deciding
the outcome of volleyball matches," Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
Hassan came here to referee the AVC Club men's tournament, to
run from June 2-7, involving such elite clubs as Sichuan Fu lan of
China, Chendu Army club, Al Rayan of Qatar, NEC Blue Rockets of
Japan, Samsung Fire &AMP; Marine Insurance club of South Korea and
Paykan of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The referee gave a high opinion of China's volleyball, saying
it is "the best in Asia for the way they play and the characters
they display on the courts".
</P>
<P>
Hassan has judged the Thailand 1993 Asian championships and
Doha 1997 Asia championships as well as 1994 junior championships.
</P>
<P>
He thought China or Japan is the biggest contenders for the
club competition and played down the chances for Qatar.
</P>
<P>
"We have two or three strong spikers but our movement on the
court are too slow, and the new setter is yet to get with the
others in the team."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Second Artillery Force under
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and Northwest China Engineering
University in Xi'an recently announced plans to join in a
cooperative effort to train more high quality personnel for the
missile force.
</P>
<P>
Today's Guangming Daily reported that the university will
become a base for fostering personnel for the missile force.
</P>
<P>
The Daily noted that the project is part of the PLA's effort to
implement President Jiang Zemin's call for using science and
technology to build a powerful PLA.
</P>
<P>
The project is also an important measure designed to open more
channels to nurture high quality military personnel and promote
the further development of military colleges, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Second Artillery Force has enlisted a substantial number of
university graduates and postgraduates in recent years, including
many enlistees who have since been promoted to the senior command
level or are otherwise missile experts.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the two parties calls for the university
to supply the force with a required number of outstanding
graduates and postgraduates each year, with the force responsible
for selecting officers to attend postgraduate courses.
</P>
<P>
The missile force will also establish a defense fund to provide
support for outstanding students who agree to join the army after
graduation.

<HEADLINE> International Labor Conference to Adopt Convention on Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The 87th session of the
International Labor Conference began here Tuesday with the
discussion and adoption of a new convention banning worst forms of
child labor as one of the major issues at this year's meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting on June 1-17, government, worker and
employer representatives from 174 members of the International
Labor Organization (ILO) are expected to conclude a multi-year,
global effort to build an international consensus for a new
convention and recommendation eliminating the worst forms of child
labor.
</P>
<P>
According to ILO, the worst forms of child labor include:
</P>
<P>
-- All forms of slavery and practices similar to slavery, such
as the sale and trafficking of children, forced or compulsory
labor, debt bondage and serfdom;
</P>
<P>
-- The use, procurement or offering of a child for prostitution,
production of pornography or pornographic performances;
</P>
<P>
-- The use, procurement or offering of a child for illicit
activities, in particular for the production and trafficking of
drugs;
</P>
<P>
-- Work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it
is carried out, is likely to jeopardize the health, safety or
morals of children.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new standards were first discussed at the 1998
conference and apply to all children under the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
According to ILO estimates, some 50 to 60 million children
between the age of five and 11 are working worldwide in
circumstances that could be termed hazardous.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the conference of the ILO's governing body will
begin debate on the revision of the ILO Convention on maternity
benefits and the terms and conditions that should apply to workers
who are pregnant or are already mothers.
</P>
<P>
The proposed conclusions that will furnish the basis for
discussion and debate within the conference committee contain
proposals for the provision of maternity leave and benefits, and
recommends adoption of appropriate measures "to ensure that
maternity dose not constitute a source of discrimination in
employment."

CANBERRA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- An academically brilliant
Australian teenager pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud over
Internet, netting him almost 26,000 U.S. dollars in goods by
illegally obtaining credit card numbers, an Australian court was
told Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The youth, who was 16 at the time and cannot be named because
of being underage, pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud and one
of attempted fraud between October 1997 and February in 1998, the
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor James Godbolt at the Brisbane District Court in
Queensland state, east Australia, said the teenager accessed a
Polish website which provided the same random number selection
process as banks used to devise credit card numbers.
</P>
<P>
Once he got valid numbers, the teenager used them to buy 37,000
Australian dollars (24,000 U.S. dollars) worth of computer goods.
</P>
<P>
He also attempted to obtain 8,000 Australian dollars (5,200
U.S. dollars) in goods from Dick Smith Electronics.
</P>
<P>
Chief Judge Pat Shanahan said he had only kept the teenager out
of jail because of his youth. He sentenced him to two years'
probation and 100 hours community service.
</P>
<P>
The youth, who is now nearly 18, is studying technology at a
university in Brisbane, capital of Queensland state.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Design Databank for Ancient Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are designing a
databank of ancient lakes to provide important information to
facilitate studies of the ancient climate and help predict climate
changes in the future.
</P>
<P>
The scientists will select some 120-odd Chinese lakes subject
to different climatic conditions and will compile files containing
water level change in each body of water, according to Yu Ge, a
researcher with the Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Yu said that some 25 percent of the ancient lakes to be
catalogued have disappeared and most existing lakes have changed
dramatically in terms of area, volume and location. The oldest
lake has a history of over 10,000 years, according to Yu.
</P>
<P>
She said that changes in water levels are closely linked to
precipitation levels, temperatures and other climatic conditions.
The project will be highly valuable for further studies of climate
changes.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that a number of countries, including the United States,
Britain, Germany and France, have established similar databanks
and the establishment of a worldwide database is within sight.
However, she noted that the world database lacks information about
ancient lakes in China and central Asia.
</P>
<P>
Yu, a leading researcher in the field, said the databank will
be translated into English by the end of this year. She also noted
that databank will be published on the Internet as a part of the
worldwide database.

stood at 110.4 million U.S. dollars in April, further
deteriorating from a level of 91.8 million dollars in the previous
month, the central bank said Tuesday.
</P>

The deterioration was contributed by a significant decrease in

said in the May issue of the monthly economic review.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in export earnings was mainly attributed to the
fall in export volume as well as decline in unit export prices, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from both traditional and non-traditional sectors
decreased by 37.8 percent and 21.4 percent, respectively, over the
review period.
</P>
<P>
Decreases in export volumes of coffee, cotton, sisal, tobacco
and cashew nuts and decreases in export unit prices of cotton and
tobacco caused the decline in traditional export earnings.
</P>
<P>
During the year ending April, trade account recorded a deficit
of 956.7 million U.S. dollars, representing a 41.6 percent
worsening compared with a deficit of 676.9 million recorded in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The trade account deficit deteriorated in the review period
mainly due to a significant increase in imports coupled with a
decline in export earnings.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Weakens Sharply Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Shilling fell sharply in
heavy interbank trade Monday morning and a senior dealer
predicted that it could drop as low as 75 shillings against the
U.S. dollar in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Local trader said there were minimal commercial interest for
dollar Monday but negative sentiment on the shilling encouraged
market players to build on their dollar positions, the East
African Standard reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Four leading banks posted the shilling 70.90/71.20 against the
dollar Monday from 70.40 /71.35 at Friday's close. Two other
commercial banks had the shilling 70.95/71.35 against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Abdalla Abdulkhailik, a treasurer at Citibank, said, "we have
established a trend and no body wants to be caught short. We are
now looking at the level 73-75 level in the next few weeks."
</P>
<P>
Dollar supply from the vial agriculture and tourism sectors
remained severely depressed, said Chris Rwengo from the Standard
Chartered Bank, who added that the bank's reserves had been
dwindling while prospects for a re-establishment of funding from
the International Monetary Fund appeared dim.
</P>
<P>
Currency analysts here said they saw the shilling in the 69 to
71 range against the dollar, with any breach of 72 expected to
trigger Central Bank intervention in the market.

released recently by the State Administration for the Inspection
of Import and Export Commodities.
</P>
<P>
The notice said all cloven-footed livestock and side-line
products brought in by travelers or via mail from that country
will be confiscated and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Cloven-footed animals and their products carried by ships,
aircraft or trains that come from Guinea and travel through or

</P>
<P>
Seized animals and products smuggled in from that country will
be destroyed under the supervision of nearby quarantine
departments, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
Sheep, goats and cattle which have contracted the disease often
show symptoms in their mouths and hooves, hence the name of the

Blisters and ulcers appear inside their mouths and in and
between their hooves, and their horns split after the disease is
contracted.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Industrial Production Value Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam achieved an industrial
production value of 67,939 billion Vietnamese dong (4.887 billion
U.S. dollars) in the first five months of this year, a
10.2-percent year-on-year increase, Vietnam News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-invested enterprises increased their industrial value
by 22.5 percent, continuing to spearhead the industrial production
growth.
</P>
<P>
The state-run sector increased its value by 3.7 percent and the
non-state sector by 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Big increases were recorded in the output of crude oil, up by
30.6 percent; fertilizers, up by 13.6 percent; bicycle, 22.4
percent; motorcar assembling, almost 53 percent; fishery
processing, over 18 percent; and motorbike assembly, 45.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Because of poor marketing some industries recorded sales and
production decreases. For example, coal production was down almost
19 percent, rolled steel down 19.6 percent and TV set assembling
down 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Vietnam's industrial production in the first five
months was below expectations, Vietnamese Cabinet members said at
a monthly meeting here last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
To address the setback, they decided to take effective measures
in June such as to tackle market and purchasing power difficulties
to promote industry and to stimulate economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy Departs for Bonn Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian special envoy on Yugoslavia
crisis Viktor Chernomyrdin left for Bonn Tuesday for another round
of talks with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
"We are flying to Bonn with new proposals developed by the
Russian side and approved by the president," Chernomyrdin said
before departure.
</P>
<P>
He said the coming stage of negotiations should become
decisive. "We hope to arrive at positive results," the Interfax
news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This week should bring us to a definite decision to switch
the military conflict to a political channel," he said.
</P>
<P>
The readiness of the West to compromise "will be seen in Bonn,
" Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
"The West should realize all the negative aspects of what may
happen if a political solution is not found.
</P>
<P>
"The foundation for a political settlement has been formed and
the most difficult thing - its implementation mechanism - should
be coordinated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
has accepted the  settlement principles defined by Russia and the
seven richest Western countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite possible to bring to the negotiating table
representatives of the Serbian side and Kosovo Albanians,"
Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
From Bonn Chernomyrdin will fly to Belgrade Wednesday to meet
with Milosevic. If the talks in Bonn turn out to be successful,
his trip to Belgrade, the fourth since NATO started air strikes 69
days ago, will be accompanied by Ahtisaari.

BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A Foreign Ministry spokesman has

After the special committee on technology transfer to China

<HEADLINE> Trade of Ho Chi Minh City Appears Signs of Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Ho Chi Minh City's trading activity
in May showed a little growth compared to April but signs of
slowdown have appeared, Vietnam's English business newspaper The
Saigon Times Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The total sale of goods of the Vietnam's biggest economic hub
stood at 11,318 billion Vietnamese Dong (about 800 million U.S.
dollars), a rise of 1.02 percent over April, the lowest
month-on-month increase since the beginning of the year, The
Saigon Times Daily quoted a report from the city's Service of
Trade as saying. The figures were 1.65 percent, 5.02 percent, 1.51
percent and 1.68 percent respectively in the previous four months,
it added.
</P>
<P>
In May, Ho Chi Minh City exported 399 million dollars worth of
products to gain a trade surplus of 90 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the month the city spent 309 million dollars on imports, a
1.8 percent rise over April, raising the total import value in
five months of this year to 1.4 billion dollars, a 4.3 percent
drop from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that trading at major markets and commercial
centers continued to be thin, and purchasing power has kept on
falling after the Lunar New Year in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index of the city in May declined by 0.2
percent from April. But compared to January it raised by 2
percent.

<HEADLINE> Morteza Alviri Elected Tehran Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The city council of Tehran on
Tuesday appointed Morteza Alviri, a well-known moderate
technocrat, the mayor of the Iranian capital of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency reported Alviri was
unanimously elected Tehran mayor by the council members with
secret ballots.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in Iran's history that the mayor for the
capital was elected by a city council.
</P>
<P>
The sitting current council was fromed on the basis of an
election in February, also the first time since the Islamic
revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The post of Tehran mayor has been vacant since former mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi was put on trial last June on graft
charges. Karbaschi was imprisoned in April to serve a two-year
jail term.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Tehran city council had been in a month-long
white-hot debate over the election of the city mayor due to
serious differences among political factions, even though the
council was dominated by moderates.
</P>
<P>
Alviri, born in 1948, currently serves as advisor to Iranian
moderate President Mohammad Khatami and Secretary General of the
Organization of Iran's Free Trade Zones.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Farmers Lambast U.S. Tariff Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- About 200 New Zealand farmers
Tuesday gathered in front of the United States Embassy in
Wellington with a dozen lambs in protest against the expected
tariffs on New Zealand lambs.
</P>
<P>
They urged the U.S. President Bill Clinton to reject the
proposal by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to
impose tariffs and quota restrictions on lamb imports from New
Zealand and Australia.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton will decide by Saturday whether to sign a
bill imposing trade restrictions on New Zealand and Australian
meat imports.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators held placards and streamers with slogans such as
"NZ, Bleed by U.S. Lamb Tariff," "Subsidies Slaughter Sheep
farmers," and "Mr. Clinton, We need those exports. Don't send our
people of South land into despair."
</P>
<P>
They said they want to send a strong message to President
Clinton before he makes the decision.
</P>
<P>
Most of the demonstrators came from South land, one of New
Zealand's most important sheep meat producers, which is about a
thousand kilometers away from the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the gathering outside the U.S. Embassy, three
mayors, who led the protest farmers to Wellington, and
representatives from various political parties and business
organizations expressed their great concern about and lambasted
trade barriers the U.S. Administration is likely to impose
against New Zealand and Australian Lamb imports to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
They also strongly criticized the U.S. for saying something,
but doing the opposite.
</P>
<P>
"I'm ashamed by standing outside the Embassy of the United
States, which calls itself the flag-bearer of free trade, to
protest against its trade barriers," one representative said.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Bailey, president of the NZ Federated Farmers, the
organizer of the protest, said the protest sent a clear message
that the U.S. ITC's proposals are "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the demonstration, the farmers handed in a
protest letter to the Embassy.
</P>
<P>
A similar protest was also held outside the U.S. Consulate
General in Auckland Tuesday.

Olympic road cycling racesSYDNEY, June 1 (AFP) - Sydney Olympic
organisers under pressure from the international cycling

Union (UCI) for approval, according to SOCOG's general manager for
sport Bob Elphinston on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Daunting Tasks Lie Ahead for ANC (II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unemployment, which stands at about 30 percent, has worsened
poverty. Most workers earn below the bread line and live in
shanty houses. The new government has to build 300,000 new houses
to ease the housing shortage.
</P>
<P>
It is no accident that the country's education system is in
such a depressing state, with an official figure of 60,000
classrooms in shortage. The ANC has a long way to go before it
can fulfill its goal of free education.
</P>
<P>
To make South Africa more governable is another task for the
ANC. As complaints grow for low effectiveness and red tape, the
ANC has to take the first step to change the culture of government
from the top down.
</P>
<P>
Thabo Mbeki, ANC chairman and president-in-waiting, has chosen
to centralize control of his executives and impose his will
directly on ministers.
</P>
<P>
He has promised to make effective the main criteria in the
appointment of his cabinet ministers. ANC officials have also
indicated that the performance of ministers, once appointed, would
be constantly evaluated in the same way private sector companies
do their managers.
</P>
<P>
In addition to measures for improving government efficiency,
the ANC has outlined its policies to fulfill its tasks in the
fields of crime control, education, health, housing and job
creations:
</P>
<P>
-- Drastically reduce the number of guns in circulation and
introduce tougher gun controls and harsher sentences for serious
crimes;
</P>
<P>
-- Move as rapidly as possible to "free, dynamic and
compulsory" education and continue to ensure the fostering of a
culture of learning, teaching and service;
</P>
<P>
-- Develop a comprehensive, affordable and accessible national
public health system, financed in part by a social health
insurance program;
</P>
<P>
-- Seek an "honest agreement" with the private sector and work
with trade unions to channel investment into housing; and
</P>
<P>
-- Introduce labor-intensive investment throughout the economy,
as well as promote sectors that have large employment potential
like tourism, manufacturing, small and large-scale agriculture and
labor-intensive beneficialness of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Inherited from the first democratic government which made a
start with transformation, peace and sensible economic policies,
the next government has to get down to another five years of hard
work.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Railways to Attract Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Railways is likely to attract
serious investors when it is commercialized, Zambia Privatization
Agency has said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Tuesday quoted the agency's
technical director and acting chief executive Stuart Cruickshank
as saying that so far, there are about seven serious investors
awaiting a green light from the central government on the mode of
the privatization the railway company would take.
</P>
<P>
"The seven investors are serious and good people who are ready
to revamp the operations of the railway system in the country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cruickshank, the railway company has shown signs
of being a blue chip and is expected to reverse the common
problems faced by various firms that did not attract investors,
ending up being privatized at far lower prices than planned for.
</P>
<P>
Railway transport analysts have indicated that Zambia Railways
is expected to be given to private investors on a franchise basis.
</P>
<P>
It is also envisaged that it would be split into three
categories: goods freight, passenger freight and communications.
</P>
<P>
According to the privatization agency, a total of 242 state-run
firms have been privatized so far, out of a working portfolio of
280 companies. A key feature of the privatization program over
the next phase in Zambia will be the new government policy
guidelines on private sector participation in strategic areas of
the economy. The government has approved the concessions of
Zambia Railways.

<HEADLINE> Australian Teenager Guilty to Fraud Over Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- An academically brilliant
Australian teenager pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud over
Internet, netting him almost 26,000 U.S. dollars in goods by
illegally obtaining credit card numbers, an Australian court was
told Monday.
</P>
<P>
The youth, who was 16 at the time and cannot be named because
of being underage, pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud and one
of attempted fraud between October 1997 and February in 1998, the
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor James Godbolt at the Brisbane District Court in
Queensland state, east Australia, said the teenager accessed a
Polish website which provided the same random number selection
process as banks used to devise credit card numbers.
</P>
<P>
Once he got valid numbers, the teenager used them to buy 37,000
Australian dollars (24,000 U.S. dollars) worth of computer goods.
</P>
<P>
He also attempted to obtain 8,000 Australian dollars (5,200
U.S. dollars) in goods from Dick Smith Electronics.
</P>
<P>
Chief Judge Pat Shanahan said he had only kept the teenager out
of jail because of his youth. He sentenced him to two years'
probation and 100 hours community service.
</P>
<P>
The youth, who is now nearly 18, is studying technology at a
university in Brisbane, capital of Queensland state.

<HEADLINE> Barak Intends to Jump to Final Status Talks: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak is considering whether to, through consultations with
the United States and the Palestinians, drop the latest interim
peace agreement and jump to final status talks, the Haaretz daily
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Labor sources as saying Barak's consideration
is based on the premise that the broad coalition he is trying to
put together will have the necessary political clout to make a
final status deal, making the interim steps stipulated in the Wye
agreement unnecessary any more.
</P>
<P>
After carrying out the first of the three stages of troop
redeployments stipulated in the Wye agreement, outgoing Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu froze the implementation of the
agreement less than two months after he signed on it last October.
</P>
<P>
Barak trounced Netanyahu in Israel's general elections on May
17 on a platform which included a pledge to move forward the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and the U.S. have called on Barak to carry out
the remaining stages of the Wye agreement immediately after he
forms a new government. Barak has until early July to put together
a coalition.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are concerned that Barak might have no much
room for maneuvering in pushing the peace process forward since he
is considering to include right-wing parties such as the Likud and
the National Religious Party in his government.
</P>
<P>
The Labor sources said even if Barak decides to bypass the Wye
agreement, he would talk to Washington and the Palestinians first
as the accord is an international agreement signed by the
government of Israel.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Ban Japanese Fishing Boats Over Tuna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia will ban Japanese
fishing boats from Australian ports and fishing zones following
Japan's decision to ignore international quotas on threatened
Southern Bluefin Tuna.
</P>
<P>
Japan has announced it will again conduct an "experimental
fishing program" for the tuna - the same method it used last year
to take 1,400 tons or 25 percent above its quota.
</P>
<P>
Japan's announcement has prompted an angry reaction from
Australia, member of the Commission for the Conservation of
Southern Bluefin Tuna.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is totally unacceptable and we are protesting
in the strongest possible terms," Australian Agriculture Minister
Mark Vaile told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"(Australian) Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has called in
the Japanese Ambassador this evening to express those strong
concerns.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely disappointing. It is flying in the face of
Japan's international obligations under the International Law of
the Sea."
</P>
<P>
Vaile said Japan's continued overfishing of the highly prized
tuna was threatening an Australian export industry worth 110
million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Vaile said Australia was considering taking legal action
against Japan and would pursue the issue through international
forums and treaties.

<HEADLINE> Low Prices to Hit Kenya's Key Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's major exports and consumer
goods will be affected by a depressed world market, with some
commodities unlikely to recover after more than four years.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive review of global commodity markets prepared by
the World Bank said some commodities that will suffer from the
falling prices, a weak world economy and a glut in the world
market are tea, coffee and sugar, the East African Standard
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tea and coffee are Kenya's leading export items and major
foreign exchange earners.
</P>
<P>
The review said the poor performance of the global economy is
expected to face a second year of slow growth this year.
Developing countries such as Kenya are not expected to register
any meaningful growth until 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya tea sector is one of the areas expected to take a
beating mainly because of higher output and better quality from
other key producers such as Sri Lanka, the review said, adding
that last year, Kenya produced 280, 000 tons of the 2.89 million
tons of tea produced in the world, and exported 264,000 tons,
coming second to Sri Lanka which exported 217,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Although Kenya led in the world in tea export in 1995 and 1996,
 agricultural experts now predict that the country is unlikely to
reclaim its leading role in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The review noted that tea production in Kenya for the first
quarter of this year was lower compared to last year following an
extended period of dry weather .
</P>
<P>
In addition to dry weather, other problems confronted with
Kenya's tea sector are older tea trees and poor leaf collection
caused by poor roads, the review said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is also facing strong tea sectors in Uganda, Malawi and
South Africa, which are fighting for a larger share of Kenya's
market in Britain, Egypt and Pakistan that account for 83 percent
of the country's export market.
</P>
<P>
Other commodities such as sugar are also expected to suffer
from low prices. Sugar production has exceeded consumption for
the fourth consecutive year and stocks are near record levels.
</P>
<P>
The review predicted that coffee production will reach record
levels in 1999 and exceed consumption by between eight and nine
million bags. Coffee prices have drastically fallen mainly to
currency depreciation in Brazil, a major producer.

<TEXT>
<P>

Volleyball Confederation (AVC) Cup men's club tournament will make
its debut here on Wednesday, providing an arena for the elite
clubs of Asian countries and regions.

Insurance club of South Korea, Ai Rayan club of Qatar, Paykan club
of Iran and Sichuan Fulan club of China.

Championship which came to an end for the great gap between the
participating teams resulting from the orignial open registration
system on the clubs' own will.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian club championship cannot go on for it failed to draw
enough attention from both the spectators and sponsors, so it has
came to a blind alley," said Liu Wenbing, the assistant treasurer
of AVC.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that in view of the lackluster performances of the
championship, AVC decided to launch the AVC Cup men's club
tournament where the teams should qualify as the winner of this
season in their country leagues.
</P>
<P>
"This aims to raise the level of the competition and enhance
the appeal of the regional event," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The hosts China is allowed to field two elite clubs including
Sichuan Fu Lan and Chengdu Army club which came in first and third
respectively in China's national volleyball league this season.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The total population of poverty-
stricken people in northwest China's Qinghai Province has dropped
dramatically to one fourth of the level in early 1994.
</P>
<P>
A total of 860,000 farmers and herdsmen have escaped poverty
over the past five-odd years, with the current poverty-stricken
population standing at 330,000 people.

The goal of a massive poverty relief project initiated in 1994
centers on ensuring all poverty-stricken people have access to
adequate food and clothing by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the province has accelerated the construction of
basic facilities and harnessing rural and grassland areas subject
to drought. Qinghai has also established more township enterprises
and expanded preferential treatment to promote economic
development in key poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The per capita income of the poverty-stricken population
reached 1,128 yuan in 1998, up some 30 percent on the previous
year.

<HEADLINE> Debt-Ridden Jordanian Telecom Seeks Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The heavily indebted Jordanian
Telecommunications Company (JTC) has asked for a loan of 73
million dinars (102.2 million U.S. dollars) from the government to
keep it running and finance future projects.
</P>
<P>
The government loan, if approved, would be used to introduce a
new mobile telephone system, the Internet project and the
installation of 200,000 additional telephone lines, Jordan Times
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The JTC now carried a debt of 95.5 million dinars (139.3
million dollars) and needed investments of some 322 million
dinars (450.8 million dollars) in the coming four years, Minister
of Post and Telecommunications Jamal al-Sarayreh was quoted by the
paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The JTC could hardly pay its employees` salaries in the coming
years until new investments are made either by attracting a
strategic partner or by offering shares to the public, al-Sarayreh
said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sarayreh added that the JTC would continue to be the only
provider for regular telephone service until the year 2003 when a
license for another company would be issued.
</P>
<P>
The JTC hoped to provide mobile phone and Internet services
through a company under it before the end of 1999, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Mobile Telephone Services (Fastlink) had been the only
one cell phone network in the desert kingdom, but its monopoly in
the industry expired last November.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Upsurge Relented in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The upsurge of highland malaria in
Kisii and Gucha districts in Nyanza Province, southwestern Kenya,
has relented, the provincial medical officer Ambrose Misore has
said.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of the disease in the province over the past four
weeks killed some 150 people and more than 2,500 people were
admitted to local hospitals and clinics.
</P>
<P>
Misore said some 200 people were still admitted at the district
hospital and the majority of the dead were children, the East
African Standard reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The medical officer said in a statement that adequate drugs
have been procured and his staff are ready to deal with further
outbreaks of the scourge.
</P>
<P>
Misore also noted that treatment was being carried out
carefully because the disease had become resistant to chloroquine
and other drugs, adding that the surveillance on the malaria
outbreak was going on.
</P>
<P>
He attributed to the outbreak of the disease to the heavy rains
in the province.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Arrives in E. Timor to Prepare for Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations special
representative for East Timor's popular consultation, Ian Martin,
has arrived in Dili, capital of East Timor, on Tuesday to start
his mission in preparing the direct ballot on the territory's
autonomy package.
</P>
<P>
Martin, who is also the head of the U.N. Assessment Mission on
East Timor (UNAMET), was welcomed by local government officials
and some members of the UNAMET.
</P>
<P>
The mission will comprise up to 280 civilian police, an
international staff of 241, 420 United Nations volunteers, and
some 4,000 local staffers.
</P>
<P>
"I have arrived here to carry out the duty mandated by the U.N.
secretary general to prepare and conduct a free and democratic
popular consultation for East Timorese," Antara News Agency quoted
Martin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. presence in the region will be neutral and not take
sides with certain groups. It will cooperate with all groups in
East Timor to get more information for the success of the direct
balloting, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by Indonesia and Portugal on May 5,
the United Nations will deploy civilian police advisers from
several countries to assist Indonesian police to maintain law and
order. A key function will be the disarmament of rival factions
that are either for or against independence.
</P>
<P>
The August 8 ballot will allow the territory's people to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
In the direct vote, East Timorese aged 17 years or above have
the right to vote whether they accept the wide-ranging autonomy
package. If they reject it, the Indonesian government will
consider a separation of the province from the country's
territory.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations will support the result of the direct
balloting, whether the East Timorese accept or refuse the autonomy
package, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
"With the U.N. civilian police presence in cooperation with the
Indonesian Police, UNAMET will assure that the tripartite
agreement is implemented by the Indonesian government," Martin
added.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has assured the United Nations and
the international community that it can control security and order
in East Timor in the run-up to the scheduled August 8 ballot.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Bodies Asked Not to Comment on Bangladesh Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina has asked foreign organizations working in the country not
to make any public comment on the country's internal affairs, a
press report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hasina asked her cabinet members at a regular weekly cabinet
meeting on Monday to communicate to foreign missions in the
country to refrain from making any public comment on the country's
internal affairs, The Daily Star newspaper quoted cabinet sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report said a recent comment by World Bank Country Director
Federick Temple about the government's claim of a 5.2 percent
growth rate in 1998-99 prompted the prime minister to issue the
instruction.
</P>
<P>
Temple told a meeting on Sunday with members of the Foreign
Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry: "5.2 percent looks
miraculous, if you look at broad economic situation and the last
floods."
</P>
<P>
He said the bank had estimated the growth rate would be around
3-4 percent supplemented by good boro crops - an irrigational
paddy variety. The government had projected a growth rate of
3.8 percent in 1998-99 at the donors' consortium meeting in April
this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the economy saw good development in boro crops, the
donor representative said, the manufacturing sector and exports
did pick the way everybody thought.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was badly hit by a prolonged flood last year, which
lasted from July to September, affecting two-thirds of the country
and causing an estimated loss of 4.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to some ministers, Temple's public comment amounted
to interference in the country's internal affairs, and one of the
ministers observed that Temple sounded like a politician belonging
to the country's opposition camp, the sources was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Hasina asked her colleagues, especially the foreign minister
and the finance minister, to communicate to international
financial institutions and other foreign organizations concerned
that they should not make public comments on the internal affairs
of the country.
</P>
<P>
If they had anything to say on any issue, they were free to
communicate it to the government, she said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Court on Rwanda Gets 3 New Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Three new judges of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) were sworn in
Monday in Arusha, northern Tanzania, the court said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
The judges were sworn in at the opening ceremony of the sixth
plenary session of the court based in Arusha Town.
</P>
<P>
Mehmet Guney of Turkey and Erik Mose of Norway were appointed
last November to replace the judges who did not seek re-election
to a second term of office.
</P>
<P>
Asoka de Zoysa Gunawardana of Sri Lanka, replaces Judge
Dionysios Kondylis of Greece who resigned from Trial Chamber III
on March 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
Their appointments bring to nine the total number of judges of
the trial chambers of the tribunal, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech after the swearing-in, legal counsel Hans Corell,
representing United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
commended the work being done by the tribunal in bringing to
justice the planners and ring leaders of the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
</P>
<P>
Corell also reaffirmed the secretary-general's support for the
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Before his appointment to the tribunal, Guney was an ambassador
in the Turkish diplomatic service and in 1998 led his country's
delegation to the United Nations Diplomatic Conference on the
Establishment of an International Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
Mose served as Judge of the Borgarting Court of Appeals, Oslo.
Gunawardana was a Judge of the Court of Appeals of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The plenary session will continue until the end of this week
with several meetings at which judges will discuss amendment of
the Rules and Procedure and also elect a new president for a
mandate of two years.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. court on Rwanda was created by the U.N. Security
Council in November 1994 after the genocide took place in the
middle of that year. More than 500,000 people were reportedly
killed in the genocide.

<P>
URUMQI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Over 5.2 million children of various
ethnic groups in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region have become stronger and fitter in recent years thanks to
the establishment of a health care network.
</P>
<P>
So far, 97 percent of township-run clinics have set up
maternity and child-care centers. A regional network for women and
children at the county, township and village levels has also taken
shape to offer immunity, disease prevention and treatment services.
</P>
<P>
"The incidence of measles in Xinjiang had dropped by 92 percent
in the 20 years ending 1998 and the mortality rate of this disease
was reduced by 98 percent," said a local medical official.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate of infants has declined from 69 per thousand
in 1990 to 30 per thousand last year.
</P>
<P>
To curb the increase of mentally retarded children as a result
of iodine-deficiency, the regional government has provided
injections of iodized oil for 3.65 million child-bearing women and
spread the use of iodine-rich salt.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Remove Industry Protective Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's protective tariff
measures currently being enjoyed by local industries will
gradually fall away, making companies more efficient and
competitive in line with international trade requirements.
</P>
<P>
Tariff Commission Chairman Dzikamai Danha said Monday that
protective tariff measures would apply to infant industries in
future but would eventually be removed as the industries graduate
to fully-fledged businesses, the daily Herald newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will protect them as infant industries by giving incentives
to those involved in production, but over time, the protection
will fall away," he said.
</P>
<P>
Too much protection would lead to inefficiency and at the end
of the day the commission would fail to achieve its objectives,
Danha said, adding there was nowhere in the world where
industrialists would find zero tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The industrialists "must fully utilise their competitive
advantages and fiercely develop niche markets in the domestic and
regional markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commission was established through the Tariff Commission
Act of 1998 to investigate tariff changes, unfair trade practices
and identify anomalies in the tariff book, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was also tasked with the reviewing of the current tariff
book and recommending rates that reduce the need for ad hoc relief
measures.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the economy, the chairman said the government had
failed to fully utilise the abundant expertise within and outside
the ruling party to develop the economy.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment the economy is in a fluid state, nobody knows
what should be done to get the economy tick in the direction of
growth and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Danha, the country had good infrastructure, a good
human resources base and many more resources, which could be
pieced together and take up the challenges.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Automotive Industry Expects Rapid Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
automotive manufacturing region, will be able to produce 400,000
cars annually by 2001, with its domestic market share increasing
to 40 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xianglin, president of the Shanghai Motor Vehicle Group,
said that the city will raise about one billion yuan annually over
the next few years for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai first made cars by imitating Mercedes Benz products in
the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The auto industry began to enter a new period of technological
progress as the city moved to set up two joint ventures with two
of the world's automotive giants, Germany's Volkswagen and the
United States' General Motors, during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
One of them, Shanghai Volkswagen, developed the Santana 2000
cars through a joint design with Volkswagen's overseas firms in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Currently, it has an annual production capacity of 250,000
Santana cars, with a 92 percent localization rate and more than 90
percent of the parts are made in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai General Motors Corp., the other Sino-foreign auto
manufacturer with an investment of 1.52 billion U.S. dollars, is
the largest Sino-U.S. joint venture in China.
</P>
<P>
It came into production in April and its daily output is
expected to climb to 250 Buick cars by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, according to Chen, Shanghai will
transform its auto industry into a major part of its economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed and another wounded overnight during
Lebanese guerrillas' attacks at a time when the militia is
expected to withdraw from Jezzine on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources said the SLA soldier was killed by a
roadside bomb when his armored car was driving from Jezzine toward
the Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Jezzine, just north of the Israeli occupied zone, has been
controlled by SLA since 1985. But on Monday it announced to
withdraw from the town and completed its withdrawal by mid-June.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA, established in 1985, are trained and
financed by Israeli forces to help them patrol the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that another militiaman was wounded in a
separate bombing blast.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
claimed responsibility for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 14 years, more than 100 SLA militiamen were
killed in Jezzine and about 400 others were wounded in the bombing
ambushes launched by Hezbollah who is spearheading a war to oust
Israeli forces and its allied SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
SLA commander Antoine Lahd Monday on Monday said Jezzine is
very dangerous for his 140-man garrison, whose commander has been
killed and his predecessor seriously wounded in Hezbollah's
earlier attacks.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Wants Curb on Subsidized Pork Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Pork Industry
Board would lodge an application this week for a temporary
safeguard against subsidized pork being imported into the country
from Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
A Wellington-based newspaper Tuesday quoted Brian Milne, chief
executive of the Board, as saying that the application will be
lodged with the NZ Commerce Ministry in response to the serious
injury that subsidized imports are causing NZ port producers.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the unsubsidized New Zealand lamb exports to the United
States which is likely to impose restriction on them, he said, the
Canadian and Australian pork imports are heavily subsidized.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion also quoted Board Chairman Neil Managh as saying
that during the past year, pork imports, mainly from Canada and
Australia, have risen to 30 percent of NZ domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
This is forcing many NZ producers, especially the smaller
producers, out of business, he added.
</P>
<P>
Managh said the NZ government and Meat New Zealand, which are
fighting a battle with the United States over proposals to raise
tariffs on New Zealand and Australian lamb, have not said anything
 about the NZ safeguard action because "they are different
issues."
</P>
<P>
"Those farmers in Canada, America and Australia all have
subsidies, and we have figures to prove it," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Two New Zealand agricultural
scientists say people who eat as little as half a clove of raw
garlic a day may gain protection against bowel cancer, the New
Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Husband and wife research team Rex and Christine Munday, of
Hamilton, a city on New Zealand's North Island, are about to
publish a paper in the international journal Nutrition and Cancer
quantifying the beneficial effects of the "stinking rose," as
garlic is sometimes known.
</P>
<P>
Modern researchers have concentrated on garlic's perceived
ability to reduce the risk of disease, particularly
cardiovascular disease and intestinal bacterial infections. The
Mundays have studied its potential cancer-prevention properties,
in an effort to find out how much would need to be eaten for a
person to benefit, NZPA reported.

<HEADLINE> China to Host International Pediatrics Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China will host the 23rd
International Pediatrics and the Second International Congress on
Pediatric Nursing between September 9-14, 2001, in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The two events will be the first of their kind held in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Medical Association (CMA), the host agency, said
that the theme of the congress will focus on "Children's
Healthcare in the New Millennium". The topic will cover 30 fields
related to pediatrics and children.
</P>
<P>
The International Pediatric Association (IPA), one of the
world's largest medical organizations, has 136 member countries
and regions. The congress, which is held every three years and
usually attracts 4,000-5,000 participants, deals with all areas
concerning children and pediatrics. The congress is regarded as
the most important of international events concerning children.
</P>
<P>
The CMA praised China for its effort to extend medical care and
protection to the country's over 360 million children. The agency
also expressed hope that the congress will provide China with
useful information concerning healthcare for children in other
countries.

<P>
Unlike in 1994 when the ANC won the first all-race election,
the new government will not have the luxury of basking in the
after-glow of a "miracle" transition. The new government's tasks
are enormous and the excuse of naivety is no longer available to
those who must perform the tasks.
</P>
<P>
The ANC has to fulfill its long-promised goals of free
education, free health care, affordable housing, job creation,
improved public transport and a responsible welfare system.
</P>
<P>
People's expectations differ according to one's political,
social and economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
For the capitalist class, the owners of property and
controllers of production, expectations and concerns include how
the election will affect their stake.
</P>
<P>
The petty bourgeoisie is also waiting in the wings to see if
these elections will open more opportunities for them.
</P>
<P>
The majority blacks want the ANC to ensure them of a decent
life which includes employment, basic education, health care and
adequate housing. "Black people first" -- an election call of the
Socialist Party of Azania -- demonstrates the urgency for the ANC
to address the basic needs of the black majority.
</P>
<P>
This is in fact a promise by the ANC when it took power after
the 1994 election. How long will it take for the ANC to live up
to its promises? This is a question constantly raised by ANC
supporters and opponents alike.
</P>
<P>
There is also a series of pressing issues the ANC must divert
its major attention to -- mounting corruption, rising crimes and
deteriorating unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Joblessness, which was cited as the number one priority of
South Africans in every single survey conducted since 1994, was
surely the Achilles heel of the ANC, which has introduced
legislation that has made it difficult for businesses to take on
new workers.
</P>
<P>
But this is ignored in favor of crime, with some of the parties
 lambasting the ANC for being soft on crimes because most
perpetrators were black.
</P>
<P>
The ANC abolished the capital punishment soon after it came to
power, a move that was blamed for rising crimes. ANC officials
have indicated time and again that the party has no intention to
reinstate capital punishment.

<P>
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian People's Assembly (parliament) Speaker Ahmed Fathi
Sorour will arrive in Algeria on June 15 from Rome, Italy, at an
invitation from his Algerian counterpart Abdul Qader Bin Saleh.
</P>
<P>
He will be leading a delegation of Egyptian parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The Tanzanian government has expressed thanks to Egypt for
its help in arranging for the release of the six Tanzanian
hostages, who had been detained in Somalia within the crew of a
ship the Somali factions had hijacked last April.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- The higher joint Egyptian-Moroccan Committee will hold its
third session in Rabbat on June 8. The three-day session will be
co-chaired by President Hosni Mubarak and King Hassan II of
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The higher committee will tackle an agreement on stabilizing a
free trade zone to come into effect on April 29 after ratification
by the two countries' parliaments.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Unemployment, which stands at about 30 percent, has worsened
poverty. Most workers earn below the bread line and live in
shanty houses. The new government has to build 300,000 new houses
to ease the housing shortage.
</P>
<P>
It is no accident that the country's education system is in
such a depressing state, with an official figure of 60,000
classrooms in shortage. The ANC has a long way to go before it
can fulfill its goal of free education.
</P>
<P>
To make South Africa more governable is another task for the
ANC. As complaints grow for low effectiveness and red tape, the
ANC has to take the first step to change the culture of government
from the top down.
</P>
<P>
Thabo Mbeki, ANC chairman and president-in-waiting, has chosen
to centralize control of his executives and impose his will
directly on ministers.
</P>
<P>
He has promised to make effective the main criteria in the
appointment of his cabinet ministers. ANC officials have also
indicated that the performance of ministers, once appointed, would
be constantly evaluated in the same way private sector companies
do their managers.
</P>
<P>
In addition to measures for improving government efficiency,
the ANC has outlined its policies to fulfill its tasks in the
fields of crime control, education, health, housing and job
creations:
</P>
<P>
-- Drastically reduce the number of guns in circulation and
introduce tougher gun controls and harsher sentences for serious
crimes;
</P>
<P>
-- Move as rapidly as possible to "free, dynamic and
compulsory" education and continue to ensure the fostering of a
culture of learning, teaching and service;
</P>
<P>
-- Develop a comprehensive, affordable and accessible national
public health system, financed in part by a social health
insurance program;
</P>
<P>
-- Seek an "honest agreement" with the private sector and work
with trade unions to channel investment into housing; and
</P>
<P>
-- Introduce labor-intensive investment throughout the economy,
as well as promote sectors that have large employment potential
like tourism, manufacturing, small and large-scale agriculture and
labor-intensive beneficialness of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Inherited from the first democratic government which made a
start with transformation, peace and sensible economic policies,
the next government has to get down to another five years of hard
work.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Withdraw Export Quota for Garments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to withdraw free export quota for garments from January 1,
2000 in order to eliminate its misuse by dishonest businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Alamgir Farruk Chowdhury said on Monday that
the ministry had already taken a decision to withdraw the free
quota to save the facility from being misused, The Independent
daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But it would not be implemented immediately until the beginning
of next year to allow enough time to review the decision, he said.
The ministry was now receiving requests from business quarters to
review the decision, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury said the free quota facility was introduced to help
new exporters, but the authorities had a bitter experience as free
quota holders, who by and large did not utilize the facility, sold
the papers to others in the market thereby giving rise to a big
black-market.
</P>
<P>
Raziur Rahman Raju, chairman of the Parliamentary Standing
Committee on the Commerce Ministry, said that the committee
reviewed the procedure for garment export quota allocation on
Sunday and felt that its administration should be tightened to
check loopholes.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to withdraw the free quota was quite justified in
view of its widespread misuse by exporters, he said. Some
businessmen were even showing documents of fake garments factories
and claiming allocation of free quota only to sell it in the open
market at a high price.
</P>
<P>
The government has also tightened the procedure for transfer of
other categories of quotas from passing more than one hand to curb
speculative business, the report quoted a source as saying.
</P>
<P>
As part of the verification mechanism, the Export Promotion
Bureau (EPB) would set up on-line computer network with importers
on the other side to check that quota documents were being
properly maintained by exporters here and nobody had tampered with
the documents to his advantage, he said.
</P>
<P>
A report in Tuesday's The Daily Star newspaper said 10 of the
country's garments manufacturers were discovered to export
apparels valued at 1.43 million U.S. dollars to the United States
recently by forging export visas and quota documents.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 and 1998, 72 forged export visas were detected by the
EPB, which had served notices against all of them, with the
operation of four of them suspended and four others penalized, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The garment industry, which has become the country's largest
foreign exchange earner, earned approximately 3.8 billion dollars
in the 1997-98 fiscal year ending on June 30, 1998.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: East Asia Expected to See Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- After significant declines for three
consecutive years, East Asia's exports as a whole are expected to
pick up this year as signs of growth have already emerged in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the cyclical changes in the world electronic market
and weak global consumption demand had led to a slowdown of export
growth in East Asia. Even the 20-80 percent currency devaluation
in some East Asian countries had failed to prompt an export rise
in the 1997-98 period.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation has been changing recently. According to
official figures, the Philippines registered a 15-percent export
growth in the first quarter of this year. Singapore's non-oil
exports grew by 8.5 percent in April. The rise broke a six-month
declining trend.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, although export revenues declined in the first
quarter year on year, it rose by 2.5 percent in April. South
Korea's export also grew by 1.5 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
While East Asia has not seen remarkable export growth yet, the
prospects are brighter than last year. One reason for optimism is
that Japan's imports from East Asia began to grow again after a
year of decline.
</P>
<P>
Japan's imports from Asia rose in February for the first time
in 14 months with imports from Singapore rising by 2.7 percent and
that from China by 19.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In April, Japan's imports from Asian nations went up 1.2
percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
"A recovery in Asian nations would mean that Japan's imports
and exports with them will be boosted because of the close
economic linkage," said Masaaki Suzuki, an economist at Fuji
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
As East Asian countries' major export destination, growing
imports by Japan would inevitably stimulate export growth in the
region, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
As well, the rising imports by East Asian countries have
brightened the hope for export growth in the region, where about
40 percent of trade activities are conducted among East Asian
countries themselves.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Philippines' imports fell 18 percent due to an
economic recession. But with the economic recovery in place, the
country's imports increased by 1.5 percent in March from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, imports grew 9.4 percent year on year in April,
boosted by rising demand.
</P>
<P>
But the most encouraging news for East Asian countries is the
higher demand for semiconductors and other electronic products in
Japan, Europe and the United States, because electronics dominate
export products of the region.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, semiconductor imports grew 14 percent in April and
the United States and European countries are also purchasing more
electronic products from East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the higher demand promoted electronics exports in
the region. In Singapore, where 70 percent non-oil export products
are electronics, export of electronic products increased 14
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, whose 50 percent of export revenues are
from electronics, exports of electronics products grew by 15
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the stronger regional currencies and Japan's
economic recession will still have a negative impact on East
Asia's export and the growth will, therefore, be modest this year,
analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Inflation Seen at 7.5 Percent By Dec. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson said Monday that he was expecting the country's
inflation rate to drop to 7.5 percent by December from 8 percent
in April.
</P>
<P>
The Malaya newspaper Tuesday quoted him as saying that the
inflation rate would average at 8-9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the Central Bank's key overnight rates will again
be lowered after this week's respite if the May inflation rate
proves to be manageable.
</P>
<P>
Economists fear that the recent increase in the price of oil
might trigger another round of price hikes.
</P>

Singson told an economic forum that the financial crisis is
over for the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite pessimism that the country's economy
contracted in the first quarter, official figures showed it grew
by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The gross national product (GNP) was better than the National
Economic Development Authority's projection of 0.8 percent growth
for the three-month period.
</P>
<P>
The market sentiment at present is more upbeat as the first
quarter economic results were better-than-expected, he said.
</P>
<P>
The stockmarket index has also risen to 2,400 since the
beginning of this year when it started from its lowest level ever
recorded at 1,192 points.
</P>
<P>
However, Singson cited several stumbling blocks to recovery,
including the ability of the high-flying U.S. economy to achieve a
soft landing and the ability of the Japanese economy to finally
turn around.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Deploy 45 Military Liaison Officers in E.Timor: Wiranto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations plans to deploy
45 military liaison officers in East Timor to help make the August
direct ballot on the U.N.-sponsored autonomy package a success,
Defense Minister/Armed Forces Chief Gen. Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
"They will not be armed and will be placed in the Indonesian
security forces' units in efforts to create a conducive situation
there," Wiranto said after attending a meeting of the Security
Restoration and Law Enforcement Council which was led by President
B.J. Habibie at the presidential office here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. military liaison officers would come from some neutral
countries, Wiranto was quoted by Antara News Agency Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
With their presence, he hoped there will be no manipulated or
biased reports on East Timor regarding the holding of the
U.N.-supervised popular consultation on the autonomy package.
</P>
<P>
The 45 U.N. military liaison officers in East Timor, as
proposed by Jakarta, would complement the 241 international
officers, 420 foreign volunteers, 280 U.N. civilian police
advisors and 4,000 Indonesian officials involved in the
organization and supervision of the upcoming popular consultation.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by Indonesia and Portugal on May 5,
the U.N. will deploy civilian police advisers from several
countries to assist Indonesian police in maintaining law and
order. A key function will be the disarmament of rival factions
that are either for or against independence.
</P>
<P>
The August 8 ballot will allow the territory's people to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
In the direct vote, East Timorese aged 17 years or above have
the right to vote whether they accept the wide-ranging autonomy
package. If they reject it, the Indonesian government will
consider a separation of the province from the country's
territory.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Open-Air Market to Be Restored in Myanmar Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The five-decade-old famous Central
Open-Air Market in Myanmar's capital of Yangon, which was
demolished and demarcated for a hotel construction project, will
reopen following the failure of a South Korean company to
implement the project.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the Myanmar Business magazine,
the land plot of the open air market, located in downtown Yangon
and opposite to the popular Bo Gyoke Aung San Market, was first
leased by the Idris Hydraulic Co. of Malaysia under a contract
with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian company later handed the land lot to the Daewoo
Corporation of South Korea for building a hotel, the magazine
said.
</P>
<P>
As Daewoo could not implement the project, the previous
open-air market will be allowed to resume business as before, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been placing emphasis on building hotels as part of
its efforts to promote tourism since it opened to foreign
investment in late 1988, adopting a market-oriented economic
system.
</P>
<P>
However, the occupancy rate of hotels has been unfavorable over
the past few years and a number of foreign-invested hotel projects
have been suspended.

JAKARTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The General Election Commission
(KPU) has registered 139 organizations to participate in
monitoring activities for the June 7 general election in
Indonesia, The Indonesian Observer reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The registration for election monitoring agencies began on May

</P>
<P>
According to KPU officials, the real number of monitoring
groups is much higher than 139.

"The final number doesn't include those who directly registered
with the Regional General Election Committees throughout the
country," said KPU official Untoro Rudiyanto, who led the
registration procedures.
</P>
<P>
About 20 foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with a
total of 515 personnel will monitor the polls. At least 119
domestic NGOs with about 3,500 personnel are also to observe the
election.
</P>
<P>
The Carter Center, an organization led by former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter, has 109 personnel to take part in election
monitoring activities.
</P>
<P>
About 139 foreign diplomats from 13 countries will also be
involved in the monitoring. Most are from Australia, the United

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Bandaranaike
International Airport is to be expanded and modernized with the
construction of a boarding bridge, a new duty-free shopping
complex and a passenger terminal, official sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program, which will cost 100 million U.S. dollars, is to be
funded by the Japan Overseas Economic Development Cooperation
Fund.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation
said priority will be given to the boarding bridge which will
expedite boarding.
</P>
<P>
The program also includes the construction of a runway and the
expansion of the cargo section, which will be funded by the Sri
Lankan government, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new duty-free complex is to ease congestion when there are
heavy arrivals. An additional baggage belt will also be
constructed.
</P>
<P>
The Bandaranaike International Airport was originally an air
base of the Royal Air Force during World War II. In 1956, it was
handed over to the Ceylon Air Force.
</P>
<P>
In 1963 it was converted into a civil airport and later named
the Bandaranaike International Airport in memory of the Late prime
minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Imports Large Amount of Crude Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has to import
280,000-300,000 tons of crude oil every year as local production
cannot meet the domestic demand, said the latest issue of the
Myanmar Business magazine.
</P>
<P>
The country produces 100,000-150,000 tons of crude oil
annually.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also imports between 100,000 tons and 150,000 tons of
diesel oil annually, it said.
</P>
<P>
The crude oil and diesel, along with petrol and lubricants,
have to be imported from Singapore and Malaysia through foreign
companies such as Daewoo, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and
Petronas, it said.
</P>
<P>
To develop the crude oil and natural gas industry, Myanmar has
since late 1988 been absorbing foreign investments for undertaking
both offshore and onshore oil and gas exploration and production
projects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, foreign investment in the sector amounted
to 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in 46 projects, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Foreign oil companies involved in the sector include those from
Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand,
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Of the oil and gas fields being developed, Yadana in Myanmar's
gulf of Mottama and the Yetagun field off the Tanintharyi coast
are the two most successful ones.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Under GSP Tumble 18 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports of goods under
the GSP tax privilege program in 1998 fell by 18.69 percent to
8.54 billion U.S. dollars, according to the Foreign Trade

A report released by the department available Tuesday said
Thailand's exports under the GSP program dropped from 10.51

Of the total, agriculture goods accounted for 1.81 billion U.S.
dollars and the rest for industrial goods.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Companies to Be Fined for Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 4,000 Philippine firms will
be fined 50,000 pesos (1,250 U.S. dollars) each by the country's
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for failure to submit
their year 2000 Compliance questionnaires in December last year.
</P>
<P>
SEC said in a recently released memorandum that as of December
29, 1998, 3,943 companies had failed to comply with the
requirement to submit a duly accomplished Year 2000 Compliance
questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the penalty, SEC said companies will also be paying
for each day that they failed to submit after the December 29
deadline.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the SEC formed a Y2K task force that will be
responsible for the monitoring of the Y2K compliance of registered
firms.
</P>
<P>
The task force made a survey through questionnaires which aims
to assess the companies in three categories - their business
vulnerability, Y2K resource and Y2K plan.
</P>
<P>
SEC reported that out of the 1,040 questionnaires submitted,
667 companies said they do not depend on computerized systems
while only 81 firms said they are highly reliable on computerized
operations.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: East Asia Expected to See Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- After significant declines for three
consecutive years, East Asia's exports as a whole are expected to
pick up this year as signs of growth have already emerged in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the cyclical changes in the world electronic market
and weak global consumption demand had led to a slowdown of export
growth in East Asia. Even the 20-80 percent currency devaluation
in some East Asian countries had failed to prompt an export rise
in the 1997-98 period.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation has been changing recently. According to
official figures, the Philippines registered a 15-percent export
growth in the first quarter of this year. Singapore's non-oil
exports grew by 8.5 percent in April. The rise broke a six-month
declining trend.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, although export revenues declined in the first
quarter year on year, it rose by 2.5 percent in April. South
Korea's export also grew by 1.5 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
While East Asia has not seen remarkable export growth yet, the
prospects are brighter than last year. One reason for optimism is
that Japan's imports from East Asia began to grow again after a
year of decline.
</P>
<P>
Japan's imports from Asia rose in February for the first time
in 14 months with imports from Singapore rising by 2.7 percent and
that from China by 19.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In April, Japan's imports from Asian nations went up 1.2
percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
"A recovery in Asian nations would mean that Japan's imports
and exports with them will be boosted because of the close
economic linkage," said Masaaki Suzuki, an economist at Fuji
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
As East Asian countries' major export destination, growing
imports by Japan would inevitably stimulate export growth in the
region, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
As well, the rising imports by East Asian countries have
brightened the hope for export growth in the region, where about
40 percent of trade activities are conducted among East Asian
countries themselves.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Philippines' imports fell 18 percent due to an
economic recession. But with the economic recovery in place, the
country's imports increased by 1.5 percent in March from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, imports grew 9.4 percent year on year in April,
boosted by rising demand.
</P>
<P>
But the most encouraging news for East Asian countries is the
higher demand for semiconductors and other electronic products in
Japan, Europe and the United States, because electronics dominate
export products of the region.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, semiconductor imports grew 14 percent in April and
the United States and European countries are also purchasing more
electronic products from East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the higher demand promoted electronics exports in
the region. In Singapore, where 70 percent non-oil export products
are electronics, export of electronic products increased 14
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, whose 50 percent of export revenues are
from electronics, exports of electronics products grew by 15
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the stronger regional currencies and Japan's
economic recession will still have a negative impact on East
Asia's export and the growth will, therefore, be modest this year,
analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Slovenia to Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 31 (Xinhua) -- To strengthen bilateral ties,
Romania and Slovenia should not only implement the existing 17
cooperation agreements but also explore new fields for further
efforts, Romanian President Emil Constantinescu said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu made the remark when meeting Slovenian Foreign
Minister Boris Frlec, who was here for a one-day official visit,
according to the Media Fax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Frlec held separate meetings with Romanian Prime
Minister Radu Vasile and Foreign Minister Andrei Gabriel Plesu.
</P>
<P>
Vasile said Romania was keen on joining the efforts with
Slovenia in regional projects such as the re-construction plan of
the Balkans and the construction of an oil and natural gas pipe
linking the Caspian Sea and the Mediterranean Sea via Romania.
</P>
<P>
Frlec agreed that working together in the economic re-
construction process in the Balkan region was in the interests of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between Romania and Slovenia increased sharply
after Romania signed the Central European Free Trade Agreement in
July 1997, a bloc viewed as a stepping stone by member states for
joining the broader European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
It totaled 79.6 million U.S. dollars in 1998 and went up to 21.
2 million in the first three months of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Edge out Trail Blazers 86-85 to Go to 2-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Sean Elliott's improbable
balancing act somehow toppled the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
Elliot tiptoed along the sideline and sank his sixth 3-pointer
with 9.9 seconds left, giving the San Antonio Spurs a remarkable
86-85 victory over the Trail Blazers and a 2-0 lead in the Western
Conference finals in San Antonio today.
</P>
<P>
With the Spurs trailing by two points, Elliott took an in-
bounds pass along the right sideline. He nearly fell out of bounds
and dribbled once before keeping his heels off the sideline and
launching a 3-pointer over the outstretched arm of Rasheed Wallace.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how I did it," Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
The shot brought the Spurs all the way back from an 18-point
second-half deficit and gave them their first lead of the game.
They made it stand up as Jimmy Jackson had a shot blocked and Walt
Williams missed a banker before time expired.
</P>
<P>
Elliott scored 22 points, making 6-of-7 three-pointers. He was
the only player making any outside shots for the Spurs, who barely
escaped with their eighth straight play-off win and home-court
advantage intact.
</P>
<P>
It was a crushing loss for the Trail Blazers, who led by eight
points with less than two minutes to go. In four games at the
Alamodome this season, Portland has lost by four points, twice by
one point and in overtime.

<HEADLINE> Lijiang's Sister River Charming Tourists with Virgin Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Deriving from the same source
mountain of "Mao'er" as Lijiang River that runs through southwest
China's scenic city of Guilin, Zijiang River is charming tourists
with its completely intact ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
The poetic beauty of its sister Lijiang has been well known
around the world, which attracts annually 8.5 million tourists to
Guilin. Zijiang, however, has been up to now relatively unknown.
</P>
<P>
The river gushes down from 2,140 meters above sea level and
runs 22.5 km through bamboo forests and steep cliffs. It boasts
the most uncontaminated water in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
To better protect the "Golden River", the local government has
urged that residential and industrial sewage and waste discharge
into the river should cease.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 560 million yuan of World Bank loans has been
provided to protect the upper stretches of the Lijiang from soil
erosion. And the city government has raised another 200 million
yuan to carry out a facelift of tourist spots along the river's
banks.
</P>
<P>
The two Guilin rivers are valuable tourist destinations, where
the landscape and ethnic customs have attracted at least seven
million visitors from 130 countries and regions and 100 million
Chinese tourists over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
In an environmental assessment of 46 key Chinese cities
conducted by the National Administration of Environmental
Protection last year, the city of Guilin was top of the list.
</P>
<P>
The city has 29 hotels in various categories and the new
Liangjiang International Airport has become the largest airport in
China's midwest region, handling ten million passengers annually.
It is now capable of receiving one million overseas tourists and
10 million domestic travelers every year.

<P>
YANGON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is making efforts to enhance
industrial productivity by taking measures to improve the quality
of products and reduce production cost, a government minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Measures are being taken to introduce modern techniques,
machines and management systems and to utilize raw materials and
equipment in the most effective way, said Myanmar Minister of
Science and Technology U Thaung, who is also chairman of the
Myanmar Industrial Development Committee.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar here on Sunday on the enhancement of
productivity of the Hlinetharya Industrial Zone in Yangon, U
Thaung said various departments under his ministry will render
assistance in research work to carry out standardization, quality
control and production management tasks to help promote
productivity.

productivity in the past 40 years and there are now 18 members in
the Asia Productivity Organization (APO) which is based in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar attended a recent APO meeting as a special guest.
</P>
<P>
He said that not only the industrial sector but also the
agricultural, fish and meat, mining and other sectors should be
promoted for national economic growth.

He called for coordination and cooperation among government
departments, cooperatives and private industrialists for the
enhancement of productivity.

<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's industrial sector
grew by 5.3 percent in output value in 1997-98, accounting for 9.2
percent of the GDP and becoming the second largest contributor to
the GDP after agriculture. The figures for 1998-99 are not
available.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which began on Sunday and ends on Thursday, is
being attended by officials of government departments and over 50
representatives of the Hlinetharya Industrial Zone, the most
successful one out of the six of its kind in Yangon.

MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 4,000 Philippine firms will
be fined 50,000 pesos (1,250 U.S. dollars) each by the country's
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for failure to submit
their year 2000 Compliance questionnaires in December last year.
</P>
<P>
SEC said in a recently released memorandum that as of December
29, 1998, 3,943 companies had failed to comply with the
requirement to submit a duly accomplished Year 2000 Compliance
questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the penalty, SEC said companies will also be paying
for each day that they failed to submit after the December 29
deadline.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the SEC formed a Y2K task force that will be
responsible for the monitoring of the Y2K compliance of registered
firms.
</P>
<P>
The task force made a survey through questionnaires which aims
to assess the companies in three categories - their business
vulnerability, Y2K resource and Y2K plan.
</P>

MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A local newspaper reported Tuesday
that Philippine Airlines Inc. (PAL) is in "final discussions" for
a 70-million U.S dollar investment from the owners of the Hong
Kong-based Bank of East Asia and a firm it identified as Topworld
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer said that the cash-strapped airline
is also holding talks to secure 30 million dollars from the
Development Bank of the Philippines, the Government Service
Insurance System and Land Bank of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a top official of PAL as saying Monday that
the cash infusion would come by Friday. The airline must raise 200
million by then or face liquidation.
</P>
<P>
PAL chair Lucio Tan has already put 100 million dollars in
escrow to finance half of the fresh capital being sought by the
debt-ridden airline.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada confirmed Monday that Tan
has raised some 200 million dollars to keep PAl flying, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
PAL, which owes some 2.24 billion dollars, began implementing a
rehabilitation plan earlier this month but some key creditors have
raised objections to the plan.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, PAL's stockholders ratified the carrier's updated
rehabilitation plan at a meeting.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Opposes Forming New Rubber Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has ruled out the
acceptance of a likely offer from Malaysia and Thailand to form a
new buffer stock agency to support falling rubber prices, the
Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Trade Rahardi Ramelan said Indonesia
did not plan to join the agency to be set up by its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would prefer to work together with
Thailand and Malaysia to save the beleaguered International
Natural Rubber Organization (INRO).
</P>
<P>
"We feel it will be better if Malaysia and Thailand can sit
together with us to discuss how to revitalize INRO's buffer stock
mechanism, which failed to stabilize rubber prices because the
organization is short of money," The Jakarta Post quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Rahardi said it would be difficult for Indonesia to join the
buffer stock agency because the country would have to spend a
large amount of cash to help finance the new agency's market
intervention program.
</P>
<P>
"The planned new buffer stock agency will be based on a
tripartite agreement. If we joined, the members would only be
Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. It means the three countries
will bear all the responsibility in funding the market operation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Rahardi said that establishing a buffer stock through the
ailing INRO would be more effective because it would involve both
producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia account for more than 80
percent of world rubber production.
</P>
<P>
INRO, which includes rubber producers and consumers, uses funds
provided by members to buy rubber on the open market to support
prices and releases supplies from buffer stocks when prices rise
too high.
</P>
<P>
The group's operations are based on the U.N.-brokered
International Natural Rubber Agreement, now into its third cycle
since 1980, which is due to expire in February 2001.

<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China's chemical industry is
seeking intensified cooperation with foreign companies to
introduce advanced clean production techniques and expertise as
well as approaches to treat pollution, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to working with foreign companies to bring
advanced production expertise, waste treatment technologies and
capital to China," Lin Yincai, secretary-general of China
Association for Chemical Pollution Prevention for Chemical
Pollution Prevention and Control Technology (CACPPCT) was quoted
by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, China has made remarkable progress
in solving pollution problems in the chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
As many as 554 environmental protection supervisory stations
have been established across the nation, with more than 20,000
staff members engaged in the sector.
</P>
<P>
However, the chemical industry now produces about five billion
tons of waste water, 850 billion cubic meters of airborne
emissions and 46 million tons of solid waste each year.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, China will enhance pollution control
in the chemical sector by stressing measures taken in the
production process. Massive technical upgrading will be carried
out. Comprehensive utilization of resources is also encouraged,
according to the State Petrochemical Industry Bureau.

2003, an information industry official said Monday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government actively participates in the
standardization process of third-generation mobile
telecommunication systems. We have offered our technology and
proposals to that end," Wen Ku, vice-director of the science and
technology department with the Ministry of Information Industry,
was quoted by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wen made the remarks at the 17th Meeting of the 8/1 Task Group
with the Radio Committee of the International Telecommunications
Union (ITU-R).
</P>
<P>
The 12-day routine meeting is to discuss and define detailed
parameters to be used to set standards for third-generation mobile
telecommunications, also called IMT-2000.
</P>
<P>
The final proposal will be set and approved in October this
year at the last meeting of the 8/1 Task Group.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to standardize technologies related with third-
generation mobile telecommunication systems, the ITU has started
evaluating various standards since 1985 and has received 15
different proposals by last June.
</P>
<P>
China, with the world largest mobile phone market potential,
plays a key role in the standardization drive.
</P>
<P>
In June last year, China submitted a technology standard
proposal (TD-SCDMA) to the ITU in an attempt to gain a position in
future standardization procedures related to IMT-2000.
</P>
<P>
However, the ITU failed to reach a uniform set of standards
because of various interests represented by world telecom giants.
</P>
<P>
The typical candidate standards are the Wideband-Code Division
Multiple Access W-CDMA favored by European and Japanese companies,
and the CDMA2000 supported by North American companies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Forestry Officials Urged to Fight Tree Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A deadly tree disease - poplar
canker is sweeping across north and northeast China, destroying
green areas in several cities.
</P>
<P>
The State Forestry Administration (SFA) has urged local
forestry bureaus to take emergency measures to monitor and combat
the disease.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic is caused by bacteria-carrying parasites in the
trees, SFA officials noted in an urgent circular issued over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The bacteria has destroyed approximately 30,000 trees - causing
withering and rotting of their bark - in Shenyang City, capital of
Liaoning Province, Harbin City, capital of Heilongjiang Province
and Tianjin Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The disease has been detected in Changchun, Dalian, Anshan and
Qinhuangdao in Jilin, Liaoning and Hebei provinces, administration
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic's outbreak was "unprecedented and unexpected," and
may have been caused, in part, by weather conditions,
administration officials suggested.
</P>
<P>
"Last winter's drought reduced the water in the trees, which
weakened their ability to fight bacteria," noted Wang Xiaohua,
division director of the administration's Anti-Pest and Disease
Center.
</P>
<P>
"Another reason is the spring's humidity was good for the
growth of the bacteria," Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Forestry officials were ordered to remove the decayed and
contaminated trees to prevent further infestation, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The administration is recommending tree-friendly chemical
pesticides be used to kill the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Forestry officials were also urged to establish monitoring
centers and undertake measures to stop infestation.

<HEADLINE> Watford Back to Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- One goal each from Nick Wright and
Allan Smart sent Watford soaring into the Premiership with a clear-
cut victory over Bolton here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Graham Taylor's men hustled and bustled their opponents into
submission, and scored both their goals at crucial moments in the
last game of the domestic season.
</P>
<P>
The win means a fifth promotion for the Hornets under Taylor,
and joy for a man whose career seemed all but over in 1993 after
his tenure as England boss ended.
</P>
<P>
But under Taylor, the Hertfordshire side have come back from
difficult times in the First and Second Division to the glamour of
England's top flight.
</P>
<P>
They were started on their way by one of the best goals seen in
a play-off final from Wright, who along with Smart, was signed
from Carlisle a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old produced a spectacular overhead kick after
Peter Kennedy's corner was initially cleared by Andy Todd.
</P>
<P>
The goal came seven minutes before half-time and slightly
against the run of play.
</P>
<P>
Bolton could have taken the lead on two separate occasions
before the goal through Eidur Gudjohnsen.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Gardner played a super ball over the top of the Watford
defence to put the Dutch striker into the area and after evading
the challenge of Paul Robinson but sliced his finish a yard wide
of the Watford goal, with Alec Chamberlain beaten.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, the same player had an even better chance, after
Robbie Elliott's free-kick was deflected into his path, and his
powerful right footed shot from ten yards out was brilliantly
saved by Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
For Watford, Michel Ngonge almost cashed in on Wright's
industry, the winger robbing Todd of the ball on the halfway line
and playing his colleague in, only for full-back Elliott to make a
superb last-ditch block.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Bolton found it harder to break down the
Watford defence and their struggles were exaggerated by the hot
conditions, which left both sets of players wearily staggering
around the Wembley turf during the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
Their best opening came on the hour, Gudjohnsen flicking the
ball onto Gardner down the left and his low cross was turned over
his own crossbar from six yards by skipper Robert Page.
</P>
<P>
Page marshalled his team superbly, and inspired them to make
the breaks which ultimately produced the clinching second goal.
</P>
<P>
Scott Sellars, on as a second-half Bolton substitute, was
hassled off the ball on the halfway line, and suddenly Watford had
a three on one man advantage.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, a star for the Hornets during the entire season,
exploited the huge gaps on the Bolton right before squaring the
ball for Smart, whose first time shot easily beat Steve Banks.
</P>
<P>
Watford had come within a whisker of doubling their advantage
moments earlier when Darren Bazeley released Steve Palmer down the
right and his pin-point cross to the far post was headed just wide
by Tommy Mooney.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Scotland's Rangers football club
vice-chairman Donald Findlay has resigned over reports of
sectarianism.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Monday, the vice-chairman sang
anti-Roman Catholic songs after his club's 1-0 win over Celtic in
the Scottish Cup Final.
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old is reported to have broken into song at an
after-match party at the club's Ibrox ground on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mr Findlay, a QC and one of Scotland's leading lawyers, sang
The Sash and Follow, Follow, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
In his resignation letter, Mr Findlay describes the incident as
"a serious misjudgment".
</P>
<P>
He says his conduct "was not acceptable" and he regrets any
harm done to the club's reputation.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have recently been made by both Old Firm clubs to
diffuse religious tension between supporters, particularly in the
light of a violent game on May 2, where the referee needed
stitches after being struck by a coin.
</P>
<P>
A massive police operation was under way on Saturday when the
game itself passed off peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Later that night a 20-year-old Celtic fan was hit in the chest
by a crossbow bolt outside a Glasgow pub while another was later
attacked in a take-away.

<HEADLINE> Gullit Set to Put Future in Newcastle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle United boss Ruud Gullit is
set to end speculation over his future at the club by signing a
new extended contract on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Dutchman arrived on Tyneside last August and despite
leading the Magpies to the FA Cup Final, is yet to put pen to
paper on the two-year deal which was tabled at the time.
</P>
<P>
But after receiving assurances on cash for rebuilding his squad,
the 36-year-old is preparing to commit his immediate future to the
Magpies beyond next season.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the club and the manager have been in discussion
for some time over the details of the deal but Gullit's agent, Jon
Smith, has admitted that the talking is all but done and he is
expected to put pen to paper within weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We are talking to Newcastle about extending Ruud's contract
beyond next season," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"He's a very wealthy man and money has never really been an
issue.
</P>
<P>
"When he came to Newcastle, they made an offer and we accepted
it. The only issue cash-wise is how much Ruud has to spend on the
team, and in fairness, the Board has been very forthcoming on that.
"
</P>
<P>
The news will come as a relief to Newcastle fans, who have
shown their approval of Gullit's methods in recent months despite
some indifferent form and poor results.

<P>
ALMA ATA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Kirghizstanian President Askar
Akayevich Akayev issued a decree Monday to set up Kirghizstan's
own national frontier force.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, the Kirghizstanian national frontier force
will be composed of members from the Frontier Bureau of the
Defense Ministry and from the National Security Bureau, an
official from the President's Office told a news conference in
Bishkek on the day.
</P>
<P>
He said his country will gradually set up a unified national
frontier force.
</P>
<P>
Borders of Kirghizstan have been guarded by Russian frontier
forces since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the establishment of such a frontier
force doesn't mean that Russian troops should pull out of
Kirghizstan immediately.
</P>
<P>
Kirghizstan and Russia are consulting each other to map out a
cooperation agreement between the two frontier forces and a hand-
over plan.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side has set up a special team to help Kirghizstan
form its own frontier force, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Belgium May Face Chicken-Egg Ban, EU Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Sales of chicken and eggs produced
in Belgium may be prohibited by the European Union (EU) after
stocks of some farms were found to contain high levels of
cancer-causing chemical dioxin, an EU official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
EU experts on animal feed meet on Monday and Tuesday to
determine what a further step should be taken to curb the food
health scare. Belgium's health ministry banned domestic sales last
Friday of chicken and eggs, saying the move was a precaution
pending the results of further tests due this week.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Franz Fischler may propose a ban that
could be cleared as early as Tuesday, the official said. EU member
states have an obligation to ensure that products placed on the
market are safe, and "what we do depend on where the Belgian
authorities are in terms of handling the problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
An EU ban could apply throughout the bloc's 15 member countries
or worldwide. "A ban could be selective or global, depending on
whether the problem is universal or only linked to a limited
number of farms," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's agriculture ministry said it was investigating high
dioxin levels in chicken meat and eggs linked to a batch of animal
feed contaminated with dioxin. Currently, such dioxin is related
to a kind of oil in chicken feed. Dioxin is a highly toxic
chemical which, once absorbed into the human body, is not excreted
and can cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
The EU official said the European Commission would decide
whether to make a proposal for a ban after hearing evidence from
the Belgian authorities. Any proposal could be voted on by the
EU's top veterinary committee, which meets on Tuesday and
Wednesday. The European Commission, EU's executive branch, could
put such a ban into law as soon as possible If 15 governments of
the EU were to back the move.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Clone First Male Mouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Scientists working in the University
of Hawaii, the United States, said on Monday they have cloned the
first live male mouse from adult cells.
</P>
<P>
The male mouse, nicknamed "Fibro", which is short for
fibroblast, the type of cell from which he was derived, was cloned
using tail-tip cells of adult male mice.
</P>
<P>
Cloning entire animals from adult cells has recently been
accomplished in sheep, mice and cows.
</P>
<P>
However, previously reported clones have all been produced
using adult cells related to the female reproductive system, which
raised the question of whether male mammals can be cloned in this
way.
</P>
<P>
The birth of Fibro demonstrated that cloning using adult cells
is not restricted to female or reproductive cells at all, said the
researchers, Teruhiko Wakayama and Ryuzo Yanagimachi.
</P>
<P>
The results suggested that it should be possible to store the
complete genome of mouse in the form of adult cells such as tail
tip, rather than embryos, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, precious animals of either sex, for example
endangered species and transgenic animals, can be propagated by
cloning irrespective of their fertility status," they wrote in the
journal Nature Genetics.
</P>
<P>
To produce Fibro, the scientists, who cloned the first mouse
from the female "cumulus" cells in 1997, used cells isolated from
male mice's tail-tips freed from skin.
</P>
<P>
The nucleus of the donor male cells were injected into an
enucleated oocyte to develop into embryos, which were then
implanted into surrogate mother mice.
</P>
<P>
"Only three of 274 transferred embryos reached full term," the
researchers reported, "three mice from tail-tip cells were born
alive, all of them males with black eyes."
</P>
<P>
The weights of the three offspring were within the range for
normal newborn mice at the time of birth. Among them, two died
within one hour after caesarian section due to respiratory
failure.
</P>
<P>
The remaining male pup, Fibro, has developed into a fertile
adult male mouse with the same color as the tail-tip cell donor.
</P>
<P>
Fibro now is completely normal in all respects, including body
weight, growth and fertility, the researchers reported.
