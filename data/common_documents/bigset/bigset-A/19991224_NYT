JOHN PATON DAVIES, 91, DIPLOMAT WHO RAN AFOUL OF MCCARTHY OVER
CHINA

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Paton Davies, a leading diplomat who was among the ``old
China hands'' driven from the State Department after Sen. Joseph
McCarthy questioned their loyalty and labeled them Communist
sympathizers in the 1950s, died Thursday at his home in Asheville,
N.C. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and about a dozen of the country's most eminent China
scholars and diplomats found themselves accused of having ``lost
China'' after Mao Tse-tung's Communist forces defeated Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists, which were supported by the American
government, in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   In his attacks, McCarthy was echoing the indignant arguments of
the China lobby, as the powerful American backers of Chiang
Kai-shek were known. Among those accused of ``selling out'' Chiang
were several diplomats, including Oliver Edmund Clubb, John Carter
Vincent and John Stewart Service, and academics like Owen Lattimore
and John King Fairbank.
</P>
<P>
   But of all those Americans whose careers were blighted in the
hunt for scapegoats, Davies may be one of the most poignant
examples. He was a decorated hero of World War II destined,
according to his superiors, for high rank in the State Department.
He was regarded as a tough foe of Stalinism whose World War II
reports from China were much concerned with the threat of Soviet
domination. In 1950 he had even proposed that the United States,
with its superiority in nuclear weapons, engage in a ``preventive
showdown'' with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Nov. 5, 1954, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
dismissed him from the Foreign Service, maintaining that Davies had
``demonstrated a lack of judgment, discretion and reliability.''
According to ``The China Hands,'' a book by E.J. Kahn published in
1972, Davies was then told that if he ever needed a recommendation
for a new job, the secretary of state would be happy to provide
one.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal took place four years after McCarthy began his
pursuit of the State Department's Far Eastern division, describing
it in a Senate speech as the home base of ``individuals who are
loyal to the ideals and designs of Communism rather than those of
the free, God-fearing half of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As he stepped up his accusations that the executive branch was
sheltering Communist sympathizers, McCarthy first asserted that he
had a list of 205 State Department policy shapers who were ``known
to the secretary of state as being members of the Communist
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he mentioned a list of 57 names, and a list of 81. Pressed
to identify anyone, he declared that Lattimore, a Johns Hopkins
University professor who specialized in Mongolian studies and had
no official ties to the State Department, was ``the top Russian spy
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   When Davies and his colleagues were accused, it was noted that
many were named John, which gave rise to a bitter riddle: Who was
responsible for losing China? John S. Service, John Carter Vincent,
John Paton Davies and John Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
   In hearings that lasted for years, several of the China hands,
including Davies, Service and Vincent, were accused by Gen. Patrick
J. Hurley, Roosevelt's special envoy and then ambassador to China
in 1944-45, of sabotaging his efforts to prevent the collapse of
the Nationalist government. Among other things, they were attacked
for having known and met with Chinese Communist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the case against Davies arose from his role in the
Tawny Pipit Affair. The tawny pipit, a bird that sings loudly in
flight, was the code name for a covert intelligence-gathering
operation contemplated after the fall of the Chinese Nationalist
government in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   After the lowering of the Bamboo Curtain when the Communists
took over, Davies was delegated by George Kennan, director of
policy planning in the State Department, to attend a meeting with
Defense and Central Intelligence representatives on ways to obtain
intelligence from China. Davies suggested that approaches be made
to half a dozen Americans friendly with the Chinese Communist
leaders, with an eye toward enlisting them as double agents.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was never pursued, but in 1952 Davies' critics
contended that he had been trying to infiltrate the U.S.
intelligence network with Communist sympathizers so they might
eventually subvert their country in support of China.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by a Senate subcommittee on internal security,
Davies parried questions while adhering to his understanding that
anything involving the CIA had to be kept secret. Later,
subcommittee members tried to charge Davies with perjury on the
basis of his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Kennan, who had worked with Davies in Moscow, strongly defended
him. In his ``Memoirs 1950-1963,'' Kennan noted that Davies had
originally run afoul of Hurley by trying to warn him against Soviet
perfidy, and largely as a result of the general's charges had
suffered ``years of harassment and humiliation.'' This, Kennan
said, reflected ``the nightmarish quality'' of that time, and he
described Davies as ``a man of broad, sophisticated and skeptical
political understanding, without an ounce of pro-Communist
sympathies, and second to no one in his devotion to the interests
of our government.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Like several other American figures in the Chinese drama, John
Paton Davies Jr. was born in China _ in Kiating, Sichuan province,
on April 6, 1908. His parents were Baptist missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   He spent two years at the University of Wisconsin, another at
Yenching University outside Beijing and a fourth at Columbia, where
he graduated in 1931. He joined the Foreign Service and returned to
China the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Stationed successively in Kunming, Beijing, Mukden and Hankou,
Davies spent the next decade observing the advance of the Japanese
armies into China, protecting U.S. interests and eventually
evacuating U.S. civilians. In Hankou, then the Nationalists'
capital, he met the leading Communists, witnessed the rout of the
Nationalist forces by the Japanese and saw atrocities committed by
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, Davies was in
Washington, on the State Department's China desk. He seized an
opportunity to join the staff of Gen. Joseph Stilwell, who had just
been named commander of the China-Burma-India theater.
</P>
<P>
   Stilwell's forces suffered defeat in Burma; after leading a
painful retreat, Stilwell was given responsibility for organizing
the defense of India and China. Davies served as his chief
diplomatic aide, political adviser, interpreter, sometime press
spokesman and Dutch uncle (occasionally warning the tough soldier,
known as Vinegar Joe, to restrain his candor and optimism).
</P>
<P>
   Tensions quickly developed between the Americans and the Chiang
government, then based in Chongqing. In his reports, Davies
expressed fear that China was headed toward a civil war that the
Communists would win, and that American support of Chiang against
Mao would drive the Chinese Communists toward the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Long afterward, he said he had mistaken the Communists' evident
popularity with the idea that their ascent to power had something
to do with democracy. He also said he had underestimated the grip
of Maoist ideology in theorizing that the Communists would be open
to American investment. In essence something like this did happen,
but it took another three decades.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, 1943, Davies was on a C-46 transport flying to China
from India when an engine failed and all aboard were ordered to
jump.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Sevareid, who was aboard as a radio correspondent,
recounted the story: none of the 17 passengers had ever used a
parachute, and all hesitated. Davies, as the senior official,
jumped first, his attache case stuffed inside his shirt. It took a
month for the group to walk out of the jungle, and according to
Sevareid it was Davies who rallied them when it seemed impossible
to go on. At one point, Sevareid said, Davies gave him his last cup
of water. Davies received the Medal of Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In summer 1944, an observation group called the Dixie Mission
was sent to the Communist headquarters at Yenan after prodding by
Davies and the U.S. Army. The mission confirmed reports of
Communist strength in the north. Davies made several trips there
and passed along two offers from Mao, one to visit the United
States to discuss further ties and the other to cooperate with a
contemplated U.S. landing on the Japanese-held coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not now abandon Chiang Kai-shek,'' Davies wrote in a
memo on Nov. 15, 1944, ``but we must be realistic. We must not
indefinitely underwrite a politically bankrupt regime. We must make
a determined effort to capture politically the Chinese Communists
rather than allow them to go by default wholly to the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley, who at the time accepted Stalin's assurances of support
for Chiang and of disdain for the Chinese Communists, now began to
denounce Davies and his colleagues, saying their criticism of the
Nationalists was meant to undermine his attempt to unify the
various Chinese military forces against the Japanese. Arriving in
Yenan in November 1944, he sent Davies back to Chongqing. Davies
was relieved to obtain a transfer to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in
January 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley gained the Communists' assent to a coalition with the
Nationalists, but Chiang rejected it, proposing one unacceptable to
the Communists. In August 1945 the Japanese surrendered, and the
opposing Chinese armies raced to take over their sectors in a civil
war in which the United States backed the losing side.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hurley returned to Washington and resigned as ambassador in
November 1945, blaming the China hands, including Davies, for the
failure of his mission. The hunt for those who ``lost China'' was
well under way.
</P>
<P>
   The first victim was Service. The FBI arrested him, accusing him
of espionage in providing classified reports on China to a small
magazine called Amerasia, but he was cleared by a grand jury. He
was then accused of disloyalty on nine more occasions before
finally being dismissed on the ground of ``reasonable doubt'' of
his loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   At the embassy in Moscow, where Davies had been promoted to
first secretary, echoes of Hurley's charges aroused indignant
rebuttals from Ambassador Averell Harriman and Kennan. Secretary of
State James F. Byrnes, on a visit, jestingly asked a Soviet leader
to be nice to Davies because Hurley was calling him a Communist.
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1951, Davies served on the State Department's
policy planning staff, under Kennan. He foresaw the French defeat
in Indochina and urged that the United States avoid getting
involved. Like Kennan he remained suspicious of Moscow, and in one
paper called for a ``preventive showdown'' while the United States
still had a monopoly on atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
   He was nevertheless a major target of the China lobby, one of
whose stalwarts was another son of missionaries to China, Henry
Luce, founder and publisher of Time magazine. When Time accused
Davies of undercutting Gen. Douglas MacArthur by warning of Chinese
intervention in Korea, Kennan wrote an angry rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to Germany in 1951, Davies was called home in the next
year to testify about the Tawny Pipit Affair. He was cleared of a
Senate subcommittee's perjury charge but was transferred to Lima,
Peru, where he served as charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
   Still McCarthy hammered away at him and at Tawny Pipit until, in
late 1954, a special security board ruled that while Davies'
loyalty could not be questioned, his employment was ``not clearly
consistent with the interests of the national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies was informally invited to resign, which would have
assured him a pension. He refused. Dulles summoned him and, in a
few words, told him he had been dismissed. It was then that the
secretary offered to provide a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Davies said nothing, although he later termed the offer
``bizarre,'' because he had been found lacking ``in judgment,
discretion and reliability.'' In a statement he said: ``There has
been enough recrimination. I am not prepared to add to it and
thereby detract from the strength of my country in its mortal
struggle with the Communist enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to his family in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   In India in 1942, he had married Patricia Grady, a correspondent
for The Washington Post and the daughter of Henry F. Grady, the
first American ambassador to India. She survives, as do their seven
children: Sasha, of White Plains, N.Y.; Tiki, of Washington; John
G., of Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Susan, of Chatham, N.Y.; Jennifer,
of Seattle; Deborah, of London, and Megan, of New Orleans. Also
surviving are a brother, Donald, of State College, Pa., and 11
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had no experience in the woodworking trade, Davies
set up a shop in Lima to design and make furniture. It succeeded,
modestly. He also wrote a weekly column for a local newspaper, and
worked his writings into a book published in 1964, ``Foreign and
Other Affairs.'' In it he took a tough view of American policy in
Latin America, suggesting that Washington show more willingness to
support strong governments.
</P>
<P>
   About this time Davies returned to Washington to, as he put it,
raise his children in a democratic American climate. Friends began
a quiet effort to obtain his official rehabilitation, but it was
not until 1969 that he was granted a government security clearance
to work on a research project on Latin America at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. Even this action was not formally
announced by the State Department, though he did obtain a pension.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and his family then lived for several years in Malaga,
Spain. He and his wife settled in Asheville, N.C., when their
children began attending college.His second book, ``Dragon by the
Tail,'' was both a memoir and a history of Chinese-American
relations from 1931 to 1945. It appeared in 1972, as the Nixon
administration's involvement with China was renewing American
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Davies concluded the book with this thought: ``The truth of the
matter is that China has been since the fall of the Empire a huge
and seductive practical joke. The Western businessmen, missionaries
and educators who had tried to modernize and Christianize it
failed. The Japanese militarists who tried to conquer it failed.
The American government, which tried to democratize and unify it,
failed. The Soviet rulers who tried to insinuate control over it
failed. Chiang failed. Mao failed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 Davies, along with Fairbank and Service, was invited to
testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Its
chairman, William Fulbright, welcomed them by saying: ``It is a
very strange turn of fate that you gentlemen, who reported honestly
about conditions, were so persecuted because you were honest about
it. This is a strange thing to occur in what is called a civilized
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, while Davies was still living in Spain, the
American Foreign Service Association held a luncheon at the State
Department in honor of the old China hands. Davies was among those
invited, but he stayed home. He told friends it would have been a
long way to go for lunch.

U.S. WOMEN'S TEAM TURNS GREEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The buzz was exhilarating while it lasted. At 165
days, it was the Joy Fawcett of all hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett, you surely remember, is a mother of two and the
smotherer of many would-be goal scorers. The celebrated defender
for the U.S. women's national team provided one of the divine
storylines of the 1999 Women's World Cup, what with her graceful
juggling of marriage, motherhood and soccer.
</P>
<P>
   For three glorious weeks last summer, Fawcett and her 19 U.S.
World Cup teammates turned the world on with their smiles. They had
more spunk than Mary Richards, more camaraderie than the WJM
newsroom and not a trace of Ted Baxter's ego.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team commanded headlines wherever it went. By the time
Brandi Chastain bared her sports bra after a shootout win over
China in the final, they had collectively enjoyed more exposure
than a swimsuit model.
</P>
<P>
   They carried themselves like role models, these women who were
seeking neither fame nor fortune, but, rather, self-fulfillment.
The U.S. squad was the cause that refreshed a sporting nation
thirsting for athletes who hadn't let success spoil them.
</P>
<P>
   That was then.
</P>
<P>
   Now the best female soccer players in the world, for all their
visibility, are barely recognizable. The sobering truth is the wide
eyes and sweeping smiles are gone, replaced by outstretched palms.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team handed the U.S. Soccer Federation a red card the
other day for mishandling the negotiations for a new contract to
replace the one that expired in July.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty they've imposed is a stiff one for soccer fans who
anticipated falling in love all over again with the Americans at
the Australia Cup, the U.S. team's first major competition since
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Superstar Mia Hamm and Company have decided to stay home, their
love of the game superceded by cash concerns. Call it a Y2Karat
problem.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that the U.S. team is old enough to remember
well the days when wealth was measured in loose change.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, which is to say a decade ago, the women played
for little more than $10 a day in meal money.
</P>
<P>
   Last year each player earned $65,000 in salary and bonuses. That
put them well ahead of the average American worker but nowhere near
their male peers. So what else is new?
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Streep doesn't make as much per movie as Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis doesn't net as much per victory as Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the tool of your trade is a ball or a ballpoint pen,
women typically continue to be paid less to do the same job.
</P>
<P>
   Parity doesn't come with one penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   Equality isn't achieved in a day, or even three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Sport mirrors life. Injustices happen; just ask the Chinese
players, who watched U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry get away with
taking a step forward before each of their penalty kicks in clear
violation of the rules.
</P>
<P>
   If there was justice for all, soccer's world governing body
(FIFA) wouldn't have decided to move the dates of the next women's
World Cup up a year, to the fall of 2002. In this new slot it'll
have to be very strong indeed not to drown in the wake of the men's
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA's message, coded or not, was clear: Women's soccer, for all
its success this year, continues to trail its big brother.
</P>
<P>
   Until women's soccer gains more of a foothold in its own world
federation, the U.S. players can't afford to put growing their bank
accounts ahead of growing the game.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, pardon us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about money,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   From the mouths of Babes, isn't that what David Letterman would
say?
</P>
<P>
   When Hamm says it's not about the money, it can mean only one
thing: Women's soccer reached its goal. It's now like all the other
professional sports. &QL;

U.S. LINKING JAILED COUPLE TO TERRORISTS FROM ALGERIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Subs for new 4th graf on FBI warning about mail deliveries) (See also TERROR-CANADA, TERROR-VOICES) 
(sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT with ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal authorities said on Thursday that they had uncovered
links between a man and a woman arrested at a remote U.S. border
crossing in Vermont on Sunday and people associated with Algerian
terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   A federal magistrate ordered the suspects _ Lucia Garofalo, 35,
of Montreal, and Bouabide Chamchi, 20, of Algeria _ held for
further investigation after the U.S. attorney for Vermont, Charles
R. Tetzlaff, said their case had ``possible ramifications for
national security.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government was not specific on what, if anything, its
investigators think Ms. Garofalo and Chamchi were planning to do in
the United States. And a statement by the Justice Department, which
included a reminder that the defendants are innocent until proved
guilty, illustrated the tight rope that the authorities have been
walking recently in trying to alert citizens about terrorist
threats without causing panic.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI issued a statement on Thursday warning that terrorists
may be planning to send mail bombs to addresses in the United
States from Frankfurt, Germany, but added that it was basing the
warning on ``unsubstantiated information.'' American citizens
receiving packages with Frankfurt markings or stamps from
unfamiliar senders should not handle the packages, and should
notify local authorities immediately, the FBI statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not cite any connection on Thursday between
the two people arrested in Vermont and the arrest of Ahmed Ressam,
who was stopped as he tried to enter Washington state by ferry on
Dec. 14 and whose rented car was found to contain bomb-making
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ms. Garofalo and Chamchi said in court on Thursday
that the cases against their clients were thin. Ms. Garofalo's
court-appointed counsel, Maryann E. Kampmann, said her client was
being held on the basis of ``associations and innuendoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garofalo and Chamchi were arrested on Sunday at Burlington,
Vt., on immigration charges after a border check found Chamchi's
French passport to be fake, the authorities said. A day later,
bomb-sniffing dogs acted as though they had sniffed traces of
explosives, although the authorities have conceded that later tests
turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the authorities say telephone-billing records and
the car the two were arrested in link Ms. Garofalo to Brahim Mahdi,
who according to American intelligence officials is a ``primary
member'' of a group called the Algerian Islamic League.
</P>
<P>
   Citing their intelligence sources, the authorities said on
Thursday that the Algerian group was founded and headed by Mourad
Dhina, whom they described as an Algerian arms dealer living in
Switzerland who is connected to groups that promote terrorism in
Europe and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Mahdi and Dhina immediately denounced the government's
descriptions of them, saying they are anything but terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know her _ I don't know Chamchi,'' Dhina said in an
interview outside his Geneva apartment, where he lives with his
wife and five children. Dhina, 38, is a physicist who studied at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am personally against any act of violence in the United
States or any other part of the world,'' Dhina said. He described
the rumors about him as ``surreal,'' and said the Algerian
government had tried to discredit him for being critical of its
oppressive rule.
</P>
<P>
   Dhina said he was active in a group called the Front Islamique
du Salut, which he said was a social organization, not a nest of
terrorists. He said he was a spokesman for a political arm of the
group and had no connection with any other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Mahdi, in an interview with The Associated Press outside his
Montreal apartment, said he had never heard of the Algerian Islamic
League. Mahdi said the telephone records and the car that so
intrigued investigators were easily explained. He said he had
transferred his cellular phone to Ms. Garofalo, whom he described
as a friend, when he realized that he could not afford it. And he
said that while the car the defendants were arrested in was
registered to him, it had actually been paid for by Ms. Garofalo's
mother. Ms. Garofalo herself could not get a car loan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont on Thursday, federal prosecutors told the magistrate,
Judge Jerome J. Niedermeier, that they needed more time to assess
the risk posed by the defendants and whether they would be likely
to flee if released. The judge scheduled a hearing for Thursday on
whether Ms. Garofalo should be released, and he set a hearing for
Chamchi on Jan. 6.

   This was a deal only McLane could love. It was an $11 million
salary chop at a time when McLane already knows he'll reap a
windfall from his new stadium's revenues and merchandising provided
by the Astros' new logo.
</P>
<P>
   McLane definitely will get his. But Astros fans are getting
lumps of coal compared to the gems that took the field a season
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gone to the Mets is a warrior of a lefthander and an outfielder
in Bell who, while flaky, drove in at least 108 runs in two of the
past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Astros fans get only more promises and potential, albeit great
potential. Astros fans get only more talk of getting younger and
looking to the future.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard it all before.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we heard it when another recently departed star, Carl
Everett, arrived in Houston in 1997. We also heard it in 1993 when
Hampton arrived from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   After developing Everett and Hampton into arguably the best two
players on the team in 1999, the Astros shipped them off to two of
baseball's big clubs at the ripe old ages of 28 and 27,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In putting their spin on this deal with the Mets, the Astros
told us they were happy they could become younger and still put
terrific talents such as Dotel and Cedeno on the field for the 2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   No argument here. Dotel is quite the prospect, with a live arm,
good breaking stuff and much potential. There's that word again.
Potential.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno will step in and provide the best speed on the club. He
also should fill the ever-important No. 2 spot on manager Larry
Dierker's lineup card and likely cover lots of ground in center
field at the Gashouse.
</P>
<P>
   Both players could become stars. But then what? More
cost-cutting? More promises and potential?
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you cut it, Thursday's deal, coupled with the
previous cost-cutting deal that sent Everett to the Red Sox,
signaled the Astros' admission that they are like so many other
mid-market teams. They are little more than a glorified farm team
for the big clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The difference here is that the Astros promised more. They
brought in Randy Johnson two seasons ago and sold fans on what
looked like a dogged pursuit of a world championship. They brought
in Moises Alou and put together a murderous pitching staff that
revolved around Hampton and Jose Lima.
</P>
<P>
   They collectively marched to McLane's mantra: What have you done
today to become a champion?
</P>
<P>
   But today, instead of marching they are stepping gingerly
through the offseason, slashing salary and all but slashing their
championship ring fingers clean off.
</P>
<P>
   After boldly winning a third consecutive NL Central title in
1999, they are slipping back to mediocrity and promising only hope.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Cedeno could become a special player in the future _
there's that word again _ there is no ignoring that he is anything
but the complete package and joins a team loaded with outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Dotel could be a great pitcher someday _ yet again,
there's that ``someday'' _ he possessed a pedestrian 5.38 ERA and
had bouts with wildness last season.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be a horrible Astros team in 2000, but it will be
hard-pressed to contend for the division title. Jeff Bagwell and
Craig Biggio alone should keep the team at or slightly above .500,
but that's still taking a step backward.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Astros outfield does not figure to be as productive as
a season ago. The left side of the infield, with the light-hitting
Tim Bogar at shortstop and the injury-riddled, 36-year-old Ken
Caminiti at third, could be a question. Catching duties are up in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   And the pitching staff just lost its No. 1 man, a lefthander,
replaced by a righthander who in 2000 figures to be the No. 3
starter at best.
</P>
<P>
   There was much medication dished out by Astros brass in the wake
of Thursday's painful trade, everyone putting on happy faces and
hoping fans wouldn't recognize what this trade was all about.
</P>
<P>
   It was about getting worse instead of better. It was about more
promises and potential.
</P>
<P>
   The only hope now is that Dotel and Cedeno someday will fulfill
their potential. Then again, by that time they'll probably be
shipped off to one of the big clubs.

<P>
   It is tempting to dismiss last week's bash in Panama as the
first of many pointless parties for which the world is bracing
itself over the next week.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that appears to be how the Clinton administration
wants it to be seen. Neither the president himself nor any of his
senior officials could find the time to be present when the United
States formally handed over ownership and operation of the Panama
Canal to the host country, fulfilling the terms of a treaty signed
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   That is a shame. Admittedly, the United States' withdrawal has
been gradual, and Panama will not take charge of the canal until
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the main reason behind the sudden diary clashes _
which caused even the secretary of state to be absent _ is that the
Panama Canal Treaty is scarcely more popular today in the United
States than when it was approved by the Senate by just one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the handover warn of multiple threats to the canal.
They are worried that it will fall under Chinese control, and that
its operation will be jeopardized by Colombian guerrillas or drug
traffickers _ or, to be blunt, Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is only ten years ago this month that the United
States sent thousands of troops to invade Panama to topple the
unpleasant and undemocratic (though not especially threatening)
regime of General Manuel Antonio Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these worries are fantasies or the bogus fears of
partisan Republicans in Congress. Take the ``Chinese threat.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Panama leased the operation of container ports at each
end of the canal to Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong-Kong-based
multinational whose biggest shareholder is a friend of China's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Panama has no diplomatic relations with China (it
recognizes Taiwan), and Hutchison is a capitalist firm with no say
in the canal's operation. But even if it had one, and was a tool of
the Chinese, so what?
</P>
<P>
   As a big user of the canal, China shares with the United States
an interest in making sure it works efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's guerrillas may seem a more genuine threat. On Dec.
12, they chose to draw attention to themselves by attacking a
Colombian navy base close to the Panamanian border, reportedly
killing 45 troops.
</P>
<P>
   But that border is in remote jungle, some 300 kilometers (190
miles) from the canal. It has long been subject to incursions by
all sides in Colombia's wars _ with no discernible effect on the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if there ever were a serious threat to the canal, the
1978 treaty would allow the United States to intervene. In fact,
there are two big reasons to welcome last week's handover _ as well
as one genuine worry.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Canal Zone and its military bases were a colonial
oddity, an affront to Panamanian and Latin American nationalism _
even if Panama's birth as a nation in 1903 was decisively assisted
by the United States for its own canal-building purposes, even if
its sense of nationhood is still a bit vague, and even if many
Panamanians now lament the loss of jobs at the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if the canal is to remain competitive in a world of
bigger ships, cheap air freight and potential alternatives (such as
a canal project in Nicaragua), it requires big investment,
especially to modernize and widen its huge locks.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely to get that as a Panamanian business than as a
distant but cosseted outpost of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is no reason to doubt the ability of Panama's
officials to manage the canal (they have had plenty of practice).
Yet there are grounds for worry about whether the country's
politicians will let them do so.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, Panama has made progress towards becoming
a stable democracy. But corruption is still widespread, perhaps
more so even than it was under General Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that Panama's politicians will seek to milk the
canal's toll revenues and the assets the Americans are leaving
behind. Panama now has a big interest in making sure that this does
not happen, and so does the rest of the world. &QL;

   ``I feel about airplanes the way I feel about diets. They are
wonderful things for other people to go on,'' Jean Kerr, an
American dramatist, once quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Flying has become safer, faster and cheaper, but it seems ever
more stressful. Having successfully fought for increased
competition, to cut airfares, The Economist has now shifted its
attention to relieving the stress.
</P>
<P>
   One frequent cause is the noise that children, especially bored
ones, inflict on other travellers.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, we proposed that all planes should have child-free
zones, just like no-smoking zones: children (and parents) should be
confined to the back of the plane. As yet, sadly, no airline seems
to agree that children should be screened and not heard.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, we would like to raise another case of what
economists call a negative externality: i.e., something which is
nice for you but imposes costs on others. This is excessive
carry-on luggage.
</P>
<P>
   In America six out of ten passengers now take a suitcase on to a
flight, rather than check it in, three times as many as in 1990.
The result is delay, because flights take longer to board.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers trying to squeeze 3-foot suitcases into 2-foot
overhead bins hold up people trying to board behind them. Some
travellers have tried to take refrigerators, television sets and
even a stuffed moose head on board.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of both children and luggage could be solved in one
stroke by putting the children in the hold, to make more space for
carry-on luggage. But that, we concede, might be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, to reduce delays, most airlines are rightly imposing
stricter limits on the size or weight of bags that can be carried
on to planes.
</P>
<P>
   This has provoked outrage as passengers are forcibly separated
from their belongings at check-in. Understandably: if you put
luggage in the hold, you have to wait ages for it at the other end
_ if it shows up at all.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have experienced the nightmare of waiting at the
luggage carousel until it stops, with no sign of the suitcase you
checked in, it is clear why people prefer to lug their cases on
board.
</P>
<P>
   You took a flight from London to Tokyo; your luggage and your
smart clothes decided to hop on one to Los Angeles. Not an
externality, but certainly negative.
</P>
<P>
   In America only 0.5 percent of bags go missing, but if you are a
frequent traveller that risk is too high.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 150 frequent fliers found that two-thirds had
experienced some sort of delay or loss to their luggage in the
previous 12 months. And if luggage remains lost, your likely
compensation is paltry _ a maximum of $1,250 in America, regardless
of whether your clothes were bought at Wal-Mart or Armani.
</P>
<P>
   If airlines are to restrict carry-ons, therefore, they also need
to offer better compensation for delayed or lost luggage. At the
least they should extend frequent-flier miles to luggage as well as
its owner: if your suitcase travels to Tokyo via Los Angeles, you
should get triple frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, passengers could be made to pay if they want to
take extra luggage on board.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, given the frequent positive correlation between
the size of the traveller and the weight of his (yes, his)
carry-on, why not take a tip from Papua New Guinea?
</P>
<P>
   When flying within the country, a passenger used to be weighed
along with his luggage before boarding the plane. Fight the flab
and you can bring your bag on board. Airplanes and diets would then
indeed be closely connected. &QL;

to agree that children should be screened and not heard.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, we would like to raise another case of what
economists call a negative externality: i.e., something which is
nice for you but imposes costs on others. This is excessive
carry-on luggage.
</P>
<P>
   In America six out of ten passengers now take a suitcase on to a
flight, rather than check it in, three times as many as in 1990.
The result is delay, because flights take longer to board.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers trying to squeeze 3-foot suitcases into 2-foot
overhead bins hold up people trying to board behind them. Some
travellers have tried to take refrigerators, television sets and
even a stuffed moose head on board.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of both children and luggage could be solved in one
stroke by putting the children in the hold, to make more space for
carry-on luggage. But that, we concede, might be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, to reduce delays, most airlines are rightly imposing
stricter limits on the size or weight of bags that can be carried
on to planes.
</P>
<P>
   This has provoked outrage as passengers are forcibly separated
from their belongings at check-in. Understandably: if you put
luggage in the hold, you have to wait ages for it at the other end
_ if it shows up at all.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have experienced the nightmare of waiting at the
luggage carousel until it stops, with no sign of the suitcase you
checked in, it is clear why people prefer to lug their cases on
board.
</P>
<P>
   You took a flight from London to Tokyo; your luggage and your
smart clothes decided to hop on one to Los Angeles. Not an
externality, but certainly negative.
</P>
<P>
   In America only 0.5 percent of bags go missing, but if you are a
frequent traveller that risk is too high.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 150 frequent fliers found that two-thirds had
experienced some sort of delay or loss to their luggage in the
previous 12 months. And if luggage remains lost, your likely
compensation is paltry _ a maximum of $1,250 in America, regardless
of whether your clothes were bought at Wal-Mart or Armani.
</P>
<P>
   If airlines are to restrict carry-ons, therefore, they also need
to offer better compensation for delayed or lost luggage. At the
least they should extend frequent-flier miles to luggage as well as
its owner: if your suitcase travels to Tokyo via Los Angeles, you
should get triple frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, passengers could be made to pay if they want to
take extra luggage on board.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, given the frequent positive correlation between
the size of the traveller and the weight of his (yes, his)
carry-on, why not take a tip from Papua New Guinea?
</P>
<P>
   When flying within the country, a passenger used to be weighed
along with his luggage before boarding the plane. Fight the flab
and you can bring your bag on board. Airplanes and diets would then
indeed be closely connected. &QL;

UCLA WINS IN OVERTIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAIE, Hawaii _ It began with a turnover. Then he missed a layup.
A few minutes later, he clanked a short turnaround, a swooping hook
and another chippie. At that point, early in the second half, UCLA
forward Jerome Moiso figured out the best remedy for his
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered if I should keep shooting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Bruins, Moiso didn't listen to himself.
Instead, he regained his composure and turned on his talent just in
(over)time to lead UCLA to a much-needed 103-98 victory over South
Florida on Thursday in the Pearl Harbor Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Through baskets and assists, Moiso accounted for nine of UCLA's
15 overtime points. His sensational baseline dunk energized the
Bruins early, and his difficult turnaround with 43 seconds left
helped clinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do it,'' said Moiso, who scored 20 points and grabbed
eight rebounds. ``Dan (Gadzuric) was in foul trouble. (Actually,
Gadzuric had fouled out.) I was the only big guy in there. I had to
keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Moiso's heroics, combined with timely shooting by point guard
Earl Watson, enabled the Bruins (6-2) to claim third place in this
fourth-rate tournament. (Colorado State beat San Jose State for the
title.)
</P>
<P>
   Always the spinmeisters, they reveled in their resiliency
following Wednesday's loss to Colorado State. They basked in their
late-game execution, and they treated it like an NCAA Tournament
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking about how much we should win by, we just
needed a win,'' Watson said. ``This is the type of loss that could
have ended our season.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the tournament draw had more to do with the outcome
than UCLA's performance. While Colorado State used the
Gonzaga-esque approach and forced the Bruins to play a half-court
game, South Florida, much like DePaul, removed the shackles and let
them gallop.
</P>
<P>
   This was an offseason pickup game in the Men's Gym against
out-of-shape NBA players _ full of fast breaks and bad shots, with
little defense and no structure.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ABA game without the red, white and blue ball _ more
dunks and alley-oops than screens and bounce passes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it was perfect for the fun-and-gun Bruins. They
scored as many points in the freewheeling first half against USF as
they did in 40 grinding minutes against impeccably-prepared
Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obviously a wild game, one of the more wild ones I've
been involved in,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``But it was
probably just the remedy we needed coming off (Wednesday) night.
The tempo and pace was more to our liking.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, without Moiso's overtime brilliance, they'd have lost
for the third time in five games.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA appeared to take command with seven minutes left when
freshman Jason Kapono buried two 3-pointers from the left corner _
the exact spot from which Kapono missed the game-winner against
Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stays with you, but it's not the kind of thing I wanted
to dwell on,'' said Kapono, who scored 17 points. ``I've taken big
shots before.''
</P>
<P>
   The baskets gave UCLA an 80-72 lead, but it didn't last. South
Florida countered with a 12-2 spurt as the Bruins committed four
turnovers in seven possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso's free throws steadied UCLA, then Watson drained a

and wide open _ Bulls forward B.B. Waldon responded with a
3-pointer from the right wing to force overtime.

   The Bruins scored first when Moiso found Ryan Bailey for a lay
up. A few minutes later, Moiso spun to the left baseline and
elevated for a jam over South Florida center Scott Johnson. On the

Bruins a 99-93 lead.

   After a three-point play by South Florida's Altron Jackson,
Moiso sealed the victory with a masterful turnaround from 12 feet

QUIET YEAR IN TV SPORTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As long as you're no longer astonished by what the networks pay
for sports, 1999 was a pretty benign year in TV sports.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from heaving $17.6 billion at the cleats of the NFL, the
networks went to the money trough again to pay NASCAR ($4.2
billion), the NCAA ($6.2 billion) and Major League Baseball ($800
million) for the rights to their games. Leagues and teams now view
the networks as their own personal ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   The interesting stuff in the contracts were the terms and years.
CBS' contract for the NCAA basketball tournament wasn't up until
2003, but it went ahead and signed an 11-year extension anyway.
NASCAR was the hot property of the late '90s, but it hardly has the
kind of track record that warrants Fox committing to eight years of
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And CBS' NCAA deal includes Internet rights. If all the
e-soothsayers are right about the promise and reach of the net,
this could be the best deal of the third millennium. A look back at
the good, bad and Gray on the tube in 1999:
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Hottest trend: (end) Ignoring the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an uptick in NFL Nielsens and white-hot NASCAR
numbers, ratings for sports events remain in decline. But that's no
longer the big concern of the networks. As they continue to lose
market share to cable, satellite and the Internet, they are
gravitating to one-time events that can carry a day (or week) or
those aimed at a select demographic group.
</P>
<P>
   Sports fills both needs. So while Fox may not get super-duper
ratings from the World Series, it will win the ratings showdown for
a week or two, deliver males with wallets to advertisers, and have
a platform to promote its latest lousy animated series.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Worst trend: (end) News show repeats.
</P>
<P>
   When FSN decided to build its main late show at 10 p.m., ESPN
responded by adding an extra SportsCenter at the same time. All
this does, though, is stack one news wheel atop the other with
little differential, making the viewer feel like he's in Bill
Murray's ``Groundhog Day.''
</P>
<P>
   FSN gets a flick on the fist, too, for too often airing the same
news show on both West outlets. That's cheating the viewer, not to
mention the cable companies paying for two outlets.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Biggest loser: (end) The fine folk at Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Already paying the biggest NFL tariff ($1.1 billion a year for
ABC and ESPN), Disney surrendered in its legal battle with baseball
over Sunday night games, to the tune of $800 million over six
years. It even paid baseball a $125 million signing bonus as part
of the settlement. Did Kevin Malone negotiate this deal?
</P>
<P>
   ABC also lost the Triple Crown series to NBC, and ESPN lost its
part of the NASCAR deal. ABC kept the Indy 500, but it's damaged
goods. Keith Jackson's retirement u-turn shined a negative light on
Disney management, the Monday Night Football booth was trimmed to
two in an economy move, and the network that set the standard for
sports coverage under Roone Arledge won only one Emmy in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Biggest winner: (end) Fox Sports Net, for hiring
Keith Olbermann.
</P>
<P>
   The K.O. Kid rubs some viewers wrong, but he's a credible voice
in a jungle full of screaming banshees. One only has to look at the
wasteland of empty-headed, fratboy SportsCenter anchors trying to
fill his earpiece to judge his impact. The whole SportsCenter gig
has become such a double-edged putty knife -- must see, but
virtually unwatchable -- that Olbermann's old tag-team partner, Dan
Patrick, has moved to the highbrow world (!?!) of radio sports
talk.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Best programming: (end) That would be ESPN's
SportsCentury series, mainly the 50 profiles produced by Mark
Shapiro. The episodes were fresh and fleshed out with details of
the athlete's less-heroic or less-endearing moments or traits, like
Martina Navratilova's homosexuality, Bill Russell's aloofness, and
Carl Lewis' lack of U.S. status.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Worst programming: (end) ESPN Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what can happen when a good idea falls into the wrong
hands. When it was merely Classic Sports Network, the events aired
were indeed vintage, classic or events that had slipped under the
radar.
</P>
<P>
   But since ESPN bought the network, it has degenerated. Just
because the ABC library is now available doesn't mean viewers want
to watch vintage 1962 barrel jumping, a random minor bowl game from
the early '90s, or hackneyed theme shows.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Best comeback: (end) Marvelous Marv Albert.
</P>
<P>
   After being banished for more than a year after his sexual
assault case, Albert slowly began earning his career back a piece
at a time, until finally this week regaining his role as NBC's No.
1 NBA play-by-play man.
</P>
<P>
   On the sports totem pole of transgressions against society,
Albert's sin was minor. I know people who were more mortified to
learn Albert likes show tunes than rough sex. But Albert's
appearance on Letterman this week was a too-jolly flashback to his
pre-assault days. It had a bad vibe.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Best moment: (end) The women's World Cup final game,
which earned an 11.4 Nielsen rating and shocked all of the jaded
suits who believe men won't watch women's sports. The success of
the event underscores that the sports audience is anxious for
something fresh.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Worst moment: (end) Jim Gray's interview of Pete Rose
during the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   It was a unanimous choice, and a fitting subtext to what TV
sports reporting is all about. The most useless species is the
sideline reporter, whose job it is to fetch a coherent 10-second
sound byte and act earnest in the process. In the history of the
genre, there hasn't been a single clairvoyant moment of great TV
sideline sleuthing, except maybe the day John Dockery returned some
trash heaped on him by Lou Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   Gray's attack was pre-meditated, which made it wrong, and he
wouldn't let it go, which made it worse. And the essence of his
question could have been asked in a way that would have delivered a
portrait of Pete Rose, man in denial. Instead, we got Pete Rose,
the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I hope NBC promotes Gray to ``Dateline'' and sends
sends him to Colombia, where he could roll out some of his tough
questions for the drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Honorable mention: (end) HBO's ``Real Sports'' and
ESPN's ``Outside the Lines,'' beacons of the business ... NBC's NBA
trio of Tom Hammond, Bill Walton and Steve Jones, maybe the best
three-man booth ever. If nothing else, they have fun ... Jim Rome,
for the consistency of his talk show and growing profile of ``The
Last Word.'' ... Tiger Woods, for his Nike ``bouncing ball''
commercial, which was merely the best performance of the year.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold Dishonorable mention: (end) NBC's poor handling of
CBS-bound Dick Enberg, who deserved better for all he's done for
the network. Enberg graciously stepped away from events he wanted,
baseball play-by-play and Olympic studio host, for the good of the
network. When he merely wanted to finish his career as a NFL
announcer, the network dissed him ... Norman Esiason, the most
annoying thing on TV since the infomercial ... Ahmad Rashad ...
ESPN's hockey production team, because Brett Hull's skate is still
in the crease ... FSN, for its rude gassing of president Kitty
Cohen ... KTLA, for the Eddie Arnold/Claudia Trejos debacle ...
KXTA (1540 AM), for firing Joe MacDonnell ...
</P>
<P>
   (set rest 8 pt)
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW THE NEWS -- USC has settled its lawsuit with former
announcers Larry Kahn and Mike Lamb ... ESPN Classic airs a
Muhammad Ali marathon on Christmas day, and it will air all 50
SportsCentury profiles back-to-back and so on Jan. 1-2. &QL;

   SAFRICA-SUBURBS (Mayville, South Africa) _ The modest one-room
houses in this fledgling black suburb are the most tangible symbol
of the post-apartheid government's commitment to redressing South
Africa's stark inequalities. And the changing lives within the
brick walls offer an intimate view of the hopes and hardships of

   NY-CREW-MAYOR (New York) _ As recently as last week, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani was grudgingly content to leave the fate of his
former friend, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, in the hands of the
seven members of the Board of Education. After all, the mayor is on
the verge of declaring his candidacy for the Senate and needs
stability. But in recent days, people close to the issue say,
Giuliani became fed up with the long-playing Rudy Crew psychodrama
and let it be known that the chancellor's ouster would make a fine
Christmas present. By Dan Barry.

<P>
   CRUISE-WORKERS (Miami) _ These are boom times for the cruise
industry. Record numbers of passengers are packing bigger and
grander ships. Miami-based Carnival Corp. is averaging $2.8 million
a day in profits this year, almost all tax-free because the company
is registered in Panama. But the benefits have been slow to trickle
down to the 70,000 or so workers who keep the fleets running and
passengers dining and dancing. Although living conditions have
improved, pay for most has risen little, and some workers say their
work has become more grueling as ships have grown into floating

   OBIT-DAVIES (Undated) _ John Paton Davies, a leading diplomat
who was among the ``old China hands'' driven from the State

high-risk, high-return world of financing companies before they go

to get 8 percent interest on a typical loan, while the average
venture capital investment in a new company almost doubled this

   INTERNATIONAL-STYLE (New York) _ The Met Life (formerly Pan Am)
Building at the foot of Park Avenue is one of the worst disasters
ever to befall the New York cityscape. All New Yorkers acknowledge
the universal truth of this belief. But Kivi Sotamaa, a young
Finnish architect, likes the building very much. Most startling of
all, Satamaa appreciates the closure that the building brings to
the southern end of Park Avenue, and to the grand boulevard of
International Style office towers leading toward it. To him, and to
a surprising number of other architects and city-lovers, the
so-called Park Avenue Corridor is the architectural heart of the
20th century. The corridor is the crystallization of the New York
myth, the soaring city of work and ambition, where the sky is the
limit and dreams are fulfilled. It symbolizes New York's
displacement of Paris as the century's most vibrant City of Light.

the Prime Mover of mood and spirit. Christmas might, in fact, be
characterized as a holiday in continual, necessary decline, a

THE CARDINAL RULES OFF THE FIELD, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's known as Quarterback U, but a list of Stanford football
heroes who went on to greatness after graduation might include
names other than Jim Plunkett, John Elway and John Brodie.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the accomplishments of doctor Joe St. Geme, businessman
Hilary Shockley and attorney John Sande III. The truth of the
matter is that while the list of prominent former Stanford players
includes a Heisman Trophy winner, Rose Bowl MVPs and All-Americans,
it also includes doctors, lawyers and bankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Stanford tradition,'' said Cardinal quarterback Todd
Husak, whose team will face Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl Jan. 1.
``When they recruit you they tell you that academics are going to
play a big part in your college life here.''
</P>
<P>
   The academic tradition is so powerful it once threatened to kill
the now-vibrant football program, Plunkett recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best proof that academic and athletic traditions can
stand hand-in-hand is Cardinal receiver Troy Walters. A 1999
first-team Academic All-American, Walters will graduate Stanford
with a 3.2 GPA. He chose to attend Stanford in large part because
of its reputation as one of the most prestigious universities in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very important to me and to my parents,'' Walters
said. ``There are skills and talents that you need in life not only
in football, but in the classroom too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sande III, a prominent Nevada attorney who was Stanford's center
in the 1971 Rose Bowl, said he came to the university for an
education first, and to play football second.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I went there,'' he said. ``I always had it in the
back of my mind that academics was important. You could get
injured, or you might not be as good in college as you were in high
school, so getting a degree was important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   After his graduation in 1971, Sande attended Harvard Law School
before returning to his hometown of Reno. His son, John Sande IV,
is the Cardinal's long snapper this season.
</P>
<P>
   Several Stanford players have gone on to impressive careers in
the law. James Urkopina, a Stanford letterman in 1957 and 1958, is
now a member of the university's Board of Trustees. Rodney Gilmore
practices law in the Bay Area and works as a television commentator
for ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   As for doctors, Don Bunce, who helped lead Stanford to a Pac-8
championship and the 1972 Rose Bowl, is a graduate of the Stanford
Medical School and works as an orthopedic surgeon at the Palo Alto
Medical Foundation. St. Geme, a member of the 1980 Cardinal squad,
is an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Washington
University School of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Shockley, a member of the 1971 and 1972 Rose Bowl teams, is
president of his own company A/R Capital. Randy Vataha, an
all-conference receiver in 1970, earns his living as chief
executive officer of Game Plan Inc., an investment banking company
for professional sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to take away from other teams,'' said Cardinal head coach
Tyrone Willingham, ``but Stanford is probably the premier
university in combining quality athletics and quality academics.
This is a program that has the ability to be the best... the
members of this team have traversed a very difficult terrain and
persevered.''

<P>
   Defeated armies, like the Russians who limped out of Chechnya in
1996, eventually work out where they went wrong and _ as the
unfortunate Chechens are now discovering _ try to do better next
time.
</P>
<P>
   But military planners who reckon they have won, like the
Americans who oversaw NATO's air war against Serbia, have less
incentive to reexamine their assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months since Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic sued for peace, hundreds of thousands of words have been
penned on the military ``lessons of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the dismay of more radical thinkers in the world of
defense, there is little sign of nettles therefore being grasped,
or vested interests faced down.
</P>
<P>
   There are some features of NATO's 78-day war that every
chronicler agrees on. So long as the definition of success is kept
fairly elastic, this was the first war in history to be won by air
power alone. The winning side lost no men killed in action and
suffered very few other losses; only two manned aircraft were shot
down.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it took much longer, and much more firepower,
to bring President Milosevic to heel than NATO's political masters
had originally expected, so the Pentagon had to scramble hard to
increase the number of aircraft and missiles used against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   This tempted a man as usually sensible as Mikhail Gorbachev to
say, late in the war, that regardless of the eventual peace terms
the moral victor would be Serbia, simply because it had held out
for so long against so powerful a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Pentagon, in its most self-congratulatory moments, has
acknowledged that the campaign against Serbia did expose some
weaknesses. The credibility of its claim to be able to conduct two
big local wars at roughly the same time looks distinctly strained,
to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pentagon was only just able to field enough
``jammers'' _ aircraft which use electronics to suppress enemy air
defenses _ to keep the skies safe for its own bombers and those of
its low-tech allies.
</P>
<P>
   As Anthony Cordesman, of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, points out in a forthcoming book, Serbia
could have posed a much more deadly threat if it had called on
Russia's best technology by using S-300 surface-to-air missiles.
Future adversaries will take the point.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a broad consensus on the weapons that saved the
day for NATO. Two sorts of satellite-guided bomb _ one cheap, the
other expensive, and both in embarrassingly short supply _ have
been singled out for laurels.
</P>
<P>
   One is the JDAM or Joint Direct Attack Munition, a device
costing around $20,000 which can be strapped on to a ``dumb bomb''
to give it deadly accuracy. The other is the Tomahawk land-attack
cruise missile, which can accurately deliver explosive power from
1,000 nautical miles out to sea, at $1 million a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The other technological star of the war was the UAV, the
unmanned aerial vehicle, which in Kosovo was used only for
reconnaissance but can almost certainly be used for more violent
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the UAVs could loiter over dangerous areas without
risk to human life or at unbearable economic cost (they are only $3
million apiece) was of huge value. Up to 15 of these gallant
machines made the ultimate sacrifice. &QL;

<P>
   So much for the winners. Among the losers cited by the Center
for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, another Washington
think-tank, is the whole principle of ``tactical air power'' _ the
powerful but relatively small and short-range fighters and bombers
which have to be deployed, maintained and protected at far-flung
bases around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of giant bombers based in the United States,
such as the B-2, is on the other hand offered as evidence that this
was a pretty good war for air power of the longer-range sort.
</P>
<P>
   Others agree with this assessment. Yet the supporters of ``tac
air'' remain robust. The Pentagon is still preparing to spend more
than $300 billion on three new types of tactical aircraft: the
F-22, which is one of the Air Force's pet projects, the Navy's
FA-18 E/F, and the Joint Strike Fighter which will serve all the
services.
</P>
<P>
   There have, however, been some signs of a political backlash in
Congress against ``tac air.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lewis, a Republican congressman whose half-desert district
contains weapons-testing sites, led a successful move in October to
stop the first procurement money for the F-22. He would rather
spend the cash on more research.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that all these aircraft-building programs are
backed by powerful lobbies in the armed forces, as well as by
legislators whose districts contain the factories which make the
fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that there is little evidence that defense
planners are taking to heart what is perhaps the chief lesson of
Kosovo. That would mean questioning the whole logic of
manpower-intensive weapons systems such as fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo fight, the average $50 million tactical bomber
which took off from an airfield in, say, Italy to drop its deadly
load over Serbia had to be accompanied by a ``strike package'' of
electronic-warfare aircraft and refuelling planes as well as
interceptors to protect it from enemy fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of highly trained rescuers had to be at the ready to
recover pilots if they were shot down. And the tactical bombers
that were not operating from land bases needed billion-dollar
aircraft carriers to get them close enough to where the war was.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining and protecting all these forces at overseas bases
was such an expensive and politically sensitive business that it
apparently makes sense for the American Air Force to send
$2-billion, two-man B-2 bombers, each of which can drop up to 32
big bombs or missiles, directly from the United States to anywhere
in the world, and then have them fly home again.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding casualties is a costly business. So would it not be a
good idea to put some of the money instead into the development of
unmanned aerial vehicles which can do everything a piloted aircraft
can? &QL;

   Within a decade or so, UAVs could be as effective as manned
fighters at dropping bombs, air-to-air combat and silencing the
enemy's air defenses.

development of a technology which could make a generation of
much-loved aircraft irrelevant. &QL;

   The Kosovo war poses a similar challenge to naval planners. If
the main purpose of sea power is to deliver explosives to targets
on land, is there not some cheaper way of doing it than building
aircraft carriers which cost $5 billion each, and need an armada of
other ships to protect them?
</P>
<P>
   An alternative exists in the idea of small ``arsenal ships''
which could be packed with every known type of projectile, and yet
need a crew of only 50 (compared with a big carrier's 5,000) and
cost only about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the Navy has shown hardly any interest in these
deadly little boats. It plans to build up to 30 small new
destroyers, which need fewer men than the existing sort; but this
is only half a step forward. And it still intends to build three
new carriers. &QL;

   Vago Muradian, who keeps an eye on military matters in
Washington, says that there is support for radical changes in
defense technology _ including unmanned aircraft, arsenal ships and
airborne lasers _ at the highest levels of the Pentagon, and among
junior officers.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance comes chiefly from middle-ranking officers who
cannot bear to wave goodbye to the weapons with which they have
grown up. So it is just a matter of time, reckons David Bookstaber,
an Air Force lieutenant who has written a lot about UAVs.

their manned equivalents by every indicator,'' he predicts. ``To

   Defeated armies, like the Russians who limped out of Chechnya in
1996, eventually work out where they went wrong and _ as the
unfortunate Chechens are now discovering _ try to do better next
time.
</P>
<P>
   But military planners who reckon they have won, like the
Americans who oversaw NATO's air war against Serbia, have less
incentive to reexamine their assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months since Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic sued for peace, hundreds of thousands of words have been
penned on the military ``lessons of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the dismay of more radical thinkers in the world of
defense, there is little sign of nettles therefore being grasped,
or vested interests faced down.
</P>
<P>
   There are some features of NATO's 78-day war that every
chronicler agrees on. So long as the definition of success is kept
fairly elastic, this was the first war in history to be won by air
power alone. The winning side lost no men killed in action and
suffered very few other losses; only two manned aircraft were shot
down.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it took much longer, and much more firepower,
to bring President Milosevic to heel than NATO's political masters
had originally expected, so the Pentagon had to scramble hard to
increase the number of aircraft and missiles used against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   This tempted a man as usually sensible as Mikhail Gorbachev to
say, late in the war, that regardless of the eventual peace terms
the moral victor would be Serbia, simply because it had held out

<P>
   There must have been plenty of times over the years, given what
the world now knows about them, when Hillary Rodham Clinton dreamed
of putting some distance between herself and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as her campaign to become a senator for New York gathers
pace, she is at last getting a chance to fulfil that dream.
</P>
<P>
   She is spending more time living in the state that she hopes to
represent; and she is also putting some light between herself and
her presidential husband on a growing range of issues, from the
economic (federal subsidies for New York hospitals) to the highly
emotional (the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy for homosexuals in
the American armed forces).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's candidacy is drawing attention for all sorts of
reasons. For one thing, she is the first presidential spouse to
move on from her husband's penumbra to run for office in her own
right.
</P>
<P>
   She is also a polarizing personality who is engaged in one of
the most delicate political operations imaginable, creating a
distance from her husband without opening up a rift with him.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason for the interest is that people think
that her campaign may finally reveal the solution to a conundrum
that has puzzled America for years.
</P>
<P>
   Is Mrs. Clinton the real power behind the throne, the brains,
backbone and guts of the Bill-and-Hillary partnership, as many in
her camp have long argued? Or is she a free-rider, a woman who
could never make it on her own, but who has used her husband's
political genius to exercise power without accountability?
</P>
<P>
   So far the auguries do not look good for the Hillary camp. Her
belated discovery that she is a Yankees baseball fan served only to
emphasize her status as a carpetbagger. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her attempts to pander to New York's militant minorities have
repeatedly backfired, most famously when she endorsed her husband's
pardon of a bunch of Puerto Rican nationalists, only to backpedal
later.
</P>
<P>
   Then, more recently, she declared that she wants to march in the
St. Patrick's Day parade, only to learn that New York's gays are
locked in a furious dispute with the parade's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   She is also treading on dangerous ground when she accuses
Rudolph Giuliani, New York's mayor and her likely competitor for
the Senate, of ``criminalizing the homeless.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers may not be as hard-hearted as they like to appear.
But they do not want to go back to the days when the streets were a
panhandler's paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mrs. Clinton's fumblings result from her ambiguous
status, part official figure, part candidate. Jewish groups
lambasted her for sitting in silence while Yasser Arafat's wife
launched into an anti-Israeli rant. But as first lady she has
learned that silence is usually the best course.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Giuliani has accused her official airplane _ a small
15-seater _ of delaying regular commercial traffic at La Guardia
Airport, and his supporters have repeatedly bitched about her
Secret Service guards. But for the country's first lady a retinue
is not an optional extra.
</P>
<P>
   Other fumblings can be explained by the fact that she is a
newcomer to New York's high-voltage politics. Yet a glance at her
past suggests that in fact her problems go deeper than this.
</P>
<P>
   From her decision to keep her maiden name when she got married
(despite the fact that she was living in Arkansas), to her
dismissal of women who stay at home and bake cookies, she has
repeatedly revealed a tin ear for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was responsible for one of the great policy fiascos
of recent decades: an elaborate plan to reorganize America's
health-care system that was meant to be the centerpiece of the
first Clinton administration but, for lack of political
preparation, died as soon as it reached Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On the scandal front, she was up to her elbows in Travelgate and
Filegate. And it was Mrs. Clinton's stonewalling over Whitewater
that led to Kenneth Starr's investigation and, by extension, to the
whole impeachment fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is one of the best public speakers in the business.
She is also relentlessly organized and focused. (Even a casual
meeting with her elicits a note about how good it was to meet you.)
</P>
<P>
   In the White House's darkest moments it has usually been Mrs.
Clinton who has organized the defenses and stiffened the troops'
morale.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998 she stormed across the country boosting
endangered candidates, raising money for her party and lambasting
the ``right-wing conspiracy'' _ carrying the banner, indeed, while
her husband stayed in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she lacks two qualities that her husband possesses in
spades. The first is a capacity for moral ambiguity. Mrs. Clinton
not only disagrees with her opponents. She regards them as moral
reprobates _ members of a great reactionary plot that must be
fought at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Her second lack is the human touch. Mrs. Clinton's tin ear is
the result of her deep lack of interest in people, at least as
living, feeling individuals.
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to her during the health-care battle that, in
dealing with politicians, you need to stroke their egos as well as
dazzle them with your intellect. And she is even less sympathetic
when it comes to dealing with what one citizen of her newly adopted
home state once referred to as ``the little people.''
</P>
<P>
   One Clintonologist argues that she has ``a high usefulness
quotient'' _ it is only useful people she cozies up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never offered us a cup of coffee,'' complained one member
of her police detail back in the Arkansas days. ``She was like a
robot. Her actions were that way to anybody who wasn't on her
level. You were just in her way.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the debate about who is the real power in the
Clinton partnership is that it misses the point: they both are.
</P>
<P>
   The crises that have punctuated the president's career have
repeatedly underlined how much Bill needs Hillary's backbone and
moral absolutism. Now the first lady's fumblings in New York are
underlining how much Hillary needs Bill's political instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since they met at Yale in 1970 they have been one of the
great political partnerships, held together by their differences.
But an ex-president is hardly likely to make a new career as a
campaign manager; and Mrs. Clinton can hardly become a political
player in her own right if she is seen as her husband's cat's-paw.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's great good fortune was that he could make his
career as the front man of a partnership. Mrs. Clinton's great
problem is that, to succeed, she has to leave that partnership
behind. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   There must have been plenty of times over the years, given what
the world now knows about them, when Hillary Rodham Clinton dreamed
of putting some distance between herself and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as her campaign to become a senator for New York gathers
pace, she is at last getting a chance to fulfil that dream.
</P>
<P>
   She is spending more time living in the state that she hopes to
represent; and she is also putting some light between herself and
her presidential husband on a growing range of issues, from the
economic (federal subsidies for New York hospitals) to the highly
emotional (the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy for homosexuals in
the American armed forces).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's candidacy is drawing attention for all sorts of
reasons. For one thing, she is the first presidential spouse to
move on from her husband's penumbra to run for office in her own
right.
</P>
<P>
   She is also a polarizing personality who is engaged in one of
the most delicate political operations imaginable, creating a
distance from her husband without opening up a rift with him.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason for the interest is that people think
that her campaign may finally reveal the solution to a conundrum
that has puzzled America for years.
</P>
<P>
   Is Mrs. Clinton the real power behind the throne, the brains,
backbone and guts of the Bill-and-Hillary partnership, as many in
her camp have long argued? Or is she a free-rider, a woman who
could never make it on her own, but who has used her husband's
political genius to exercise power without accountability?
</P>
<P>
   So far the auguries do not look good for the Hillary camp. Her
belated discovery that she is a Yankees baseball fan served only to
emphasize her status as a carpetbagger. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her attempts to pander to New York's militant minorities have
repeatedly backfired, most famously when she endorsed her husband's
pardon of a bunch of Puerto Rican nationalists, only to backpedal
later.
</P>
<P>
   Then, more recently, she declared that she wants to march in the
St. Patrick's Day parade, only to learn that New York's gays are
locked in a furious dispute with the parade's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   She is also treading on dangerous ground when she accuses
Rudolph Giuliani, New York's mayor and her likely competitor for
the Senate, of ``criminalizing the homeless.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers may not be as hard-hearted as they like to appear.
But they do not want to go back to the days when the streets were a
panhandler's paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mrs. Clinton's fumblings result from her ambiguous
status, part official figure, part candidate. Jewish groups
lambasted her for sitting in silence while Yasser Arafat's wife
launched into an anti-Israeli rant. But as first lady she has
learned that silence is usually the best course.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Giuliani has accused her official airplane _ a small
15-seater _ of delaying regular commercial traffic at La Guardia
Airport, and his supporters have repeatedly bitched about her
Secret Service guards. But for the country's first lady a retinue
is not an optional extra.
</P>
<P>
   Other fumblings can be explained by the fact that she is a
newcomer to New York's high-voltage politics. Yet a glance at her
past suggests that in fact her problems go deeper than this.
</P>
<P>
   From her decision to keep her maiden name when she got married
(despite the fact that she was living in Arkansas), to her
dismissal of women who stay at home and bake cookies, she has
repeatedly revealed a tin ear for poltics.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was responsible for one of the great policy fiascos
of recent decades: an elaborate plan to reorganize America's
health-care system that was meant to be the centerpiece of the
first Clinton administration but, for lack of political
preparation, died as soon as it reached Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On the scandal front, she was up to her elbows in Travelgate and
Filegate. And it was Mrs. Clinton's stonewalling over Whitewater
that led to Kenneth Starr's investigation and, by extension, to the
whole impeachment fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is one of the best public speakers in the business.
She is also relentlessly organized and focused. (Even a casual
meeting with her elicits a note about how good it was to meet you.)
</P>
<P>
   In the White House's darkest moments it has usually been Mrs.
Clinton who has organized the defenses and stiffened the troops'
morale.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998 she stormed across the country boosting
endangered candidates, raising money for her party and lambasting
the ``right-wing conspiracy'' _ carrying the banner, indeed, while
her husband stayed in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she lacks two qualities that her husband possesses in
spades. The first is a capacity for moral ambiguity. Mrs. Clinton
not only disagrees with her opponents. She regards them as moral
reprobates _ members of a great reactionary plot that must be
fought at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Her second lack is the human touch. Mrs. Clinton's tin ear is
the result of her deep lack of interest in people, at least as
living, feeling individuals.
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to her during the health-care battle that, in
dealing with politicians, you need to stroke their egos as well as
dazzle them with your intellect. And she is even less sympathetic
when it comes to dealing with what one citizen of her newly adopted
home state once referred to as ``the little people.''
</P>
<P>
   One Clintonologist argues that she has ``a high usefulness
quotient'' _ it is only useful people she cozies up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never offered us a cup of coffee,'' complained one member
of her police detail back in the Arkansas days. ``She was like a
robot. Her actions were that way to anybody who wasn't on her
level. You were just in her way.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the debate about who is the real power in the
Clinton partnership is that it misses the point: they both are.
</P>
<P>
   The crises that have punctuated the president's career have
repeatedly underlined how much Bill needs Hillary's backbone and
moral absolutism. Now the first lady's fumblings in New York are
underlining how much Hillary needs Bill's political instincts.

DOSE OF BUDGETING CURES HEADACHES FROM HOLIDAY SPENDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jason Takenouchi  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The average holiday shopping binge only lasts a
few weeks, but the financial baggage can stretch well into the next
millennium if you aren't careful.
</P>
<P>
   Credit counselors agree that smart spending is the key to
getting your financial house in order and keeping out of the red.
But for erstwhile overspenders who are already in financial straits
-- with a pile of overdue bills alongside those nicely wrapped
gifts -- more extreme steps may be in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing for the after-holiday spending blues is to sit
down and work out a budget,'' said Dave Matheny, public relations
director for the nonprofit Credit Counseling Centers of America.
``The biggest thing is to focus on where the money is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Your budget should include all your expenses, including food,
transportation, utilities and movie rentals.
</P>
<P>
   A comprehensive budget is only the first step, though. Further
debt management measures recommended by credit counselors include:
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Find out how much you owe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might seem obvious, but often people don't want to open
up their bills and face them,'' said Jennifer Root, public
relations director for the nonprofit Consumer Credit Counseling
Service of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!When you write your budget, be sure to include obligations
that only come once or twice a year. That will help prepare you car
registration payments, taxes or other big expenses down the road.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!If you have a lot of credit card debt, try to make more
than just the minimum payments.
</P>
<P>
   According to CCCS-LA, it can take more than 16 years of minimum
payments to pay the average household's $840 in holiday spending.
Even a sturdy plastic Santa won't last that long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people feel like if they're paying the minimum, that's
good,'' Root said. ``In reality, that really isn't OK.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Find places to cut back until your finances recover. Brown
bag lunches may not be prestigious, but they will save you money.
</P>
<P>
   -- Get help if you need it. Several nonprofit agencies offer
free credit counseling, and most are listed in the phone book. Be
sure to ask if the agency is accredited.
</P>
<P>
   -- If you're having problems making payments, talk it over with
your creditors. They probably don't want you to go bankrupt,
either, and they may be willing to alter your payment schedule or
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't expect instant results. If it took you a few years to
amass your debt, that same debt won't go away overnight.
</P>
<P>
   But budgeting doesn't have to be all doom and gloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``As part of your budget, just like you pay utility bills of a
mortgage, pay an amount to yourself,'' Matheny said. After your
finances are in order, that money should be used as a reward --
such as a vacation or special purchase -- that will make all the
austerity worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the idea of holding off now for something bigger or
better in the future,'' Matheny said.
</P>
<P>
   Once your finances are in a semblance of order, you can get to
work on repairing your credit.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that if you missed payments or paid bills late, your
credit report will reflect that for several years. Those black
marks could hurt your chances to get a loan or finance a major
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   You can improve your credit with a little discipline, though.
Some advice from the experts:
</P>
<P>
   -- The best way to boost your credit is by proving your
worthiness. Bring your payments up to date and pay your bills on
time.
</P>
<P>
   -- In general, avoid credit repair companies. Credit counselors
say most of the services offered by such companies are available
for free elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   -- Build an emergency fund. If disaster strikes, you can draw
down the fund instead of getting into deeper debt. &QL;

NETS DEFEAT 76ERS, 99-94 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Kendall Gill is one of Don Casey's
favorite players in the National Basketball Association. Gill is
also a close friend to Casey, the New Jersey Nets' coach. But that
did not stop Casey from wincing, praying and crossing his fingers
when Gill received a pass from Kerry Kittles with 14 seconds left
in Thursday night's game against the Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets were holding on to a slippery 2-point lead, and Gill
was clearly about to hoist a wide-open 21-foot jump shot from the
right corner. With Gill being far from a great outside shooter and
Philadelphia's Allen Iverson playing phenomenally, the chances of a
miss and subsequent heart-wrenching loss to the hated 76ers were
good. And Casey knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been shooting well and I was saying to myself, `If
there's a God and he's fair and let us assume that he came from
Africa or Egypt, it will go in,''' Casey said moments after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The shot indeed went in and gave the Nets the cushion they
needed to pull out a 99-94 victory over Philadelphia, the team
coached by the dreaded Larry Brown and John Calipari and led by
Iverson's dazzling 42-point performance.
</P>
<P>
   There was great symbolism in Gill's hitting the final shot,
particularly from a spot just a few feet in front of Brown. In
preseason comments about Calipari's firing last season as head
coach of the Nets, Brown, a longtime friend of Calipari, implied
that Gill was unprofessional and a problem player who conspired
with Jayson Williams, General Manager John Nash, the team president
Michael Rowe and Casey to have Calipari ousted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was apropos,'' Casey said of Gill's shot. ``The guy blasted
him in the paper, and he shoots a game-winner right in front of
him. It's very dramatic. For that, I feel good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Casey also felt good for himself. He had not been left
untouched by Brown, who was ejected in the 76ers' first trip to the
Meadowlands on Nov. 20 only to have Calipari take over and lead
Philadelphia to a humiliating 100-96 victory. At the time, the Nets
were foundering at 1-9, and Casey seemed on the verge of being
fired. While both Brown and Calipari denied planning that turn of
events, almost everyone associated with the Nets believes it was
staged. So after hitting the final shot tonight, Gill yelled some
choice words at Brown while walking toward the Nets' bench during a
timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what I was saying, but it was in the heat of
the moment,'' Gill said. ``It wasn't Merry Christmas or Happy New
Year.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Nets broke the huddle, Gill and Casey shared a few
words, a smile and a hug on the sideline before Gill returned to
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time they were here, we thought that Larry Brown got
thrown out of the game on purpose so that Cal could coach them,''
Gill said in explaining his impromptu chitchat with Casey. ``They
knew that we were struggling at that time. So this time, I told
Case that that was his Christmas present from me. He bought me a
money clip, and I got him a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill's success in the clutch epitomized his improved play
lately. While struggling earlier in the season, he missed a similar
wide-open jumper in the closing moments of a 96-92 loss at
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I had the opportunity to hit the shot,'' said Gill,
who had 10 of his 11 points in the second half. ``Everybody thinks
I can't shoot, but you can't score 10,000 points in this league
without being able to shoot. This was the biggest shot for me all
year and this was our biggest win because we beat the guys that
smashed us in the newspapers. I think we have sort of a rivalry
going with them now, since we're so close and Cal is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was the best victory for us this year, period.
Scratch all the rest of them. This one really meant something to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets started with playoff intensity and effectiveness,
leading by as many as 14 points in the first half and taking a
53-43 lead at halftime. They headed into the fourth quarter ahead
by 74-64 when Philadelphia began its charge.
</P>
<P>
   With Iverson, who made 11 of 26 field-goal attempts and 17 of 20
free throws over all, scoring 6 points, the 76ers moved within
82-81 with six minutes left. But Jamie Feick nailed a 21-footer,
then followed a layup by Keith Van Horn (25 points, 12 rebounds)
with a great midair assist to push the Nets' lead back to 89-83.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kendall's shot, Feick's pass and Feick's rebound were the
three biggest plays of the game and every game, you have to have
three big plays and those were them,'' said Stephon Marbury, who
joined Kerry Kittles with 21 points for the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   But the 76ers would not die quickly. They pulled within 96-94 on
two free throws by Iverson with 1 minute 14 seconds left, and
seemed ready to crush the Nets again until Gill received the pass,
made the shot and ruined their plans. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The shop is open, but you cannot get through the door
for the crowds flooding in from across the country. After you
finally squeeze inside, you have a question.
</P>
<P>
   A sales assistant asks you to write it down and tells you that
someone might reply _ after next Tuesday. You fill your shopping
basket anyway. At the till, however, the cashier removes several
items from your cart: ``Sorry, these are just for display. We are
sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, you discover your credit card has been charged anyway _
twice, in fact. And, mysteriously, your bag contains things you
have never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   You go back to the store to complain. The sales assistant has no
memory of who you are or of what you bought. He suggests you
auction your unwanted purchases on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would accept such treatment in a real shop. But Internet
shopping is blighted by overburdened Web sites without a precise
idea of their inventory, or of how to serve customers, or of when
deliveries will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas e-commerce was still a novelty, and customers
were willing to put up with all sorts of shortcomings. But with
sales expected to double to $6 billion this year, online shopping
is past being a prototype. Customers expect to be treated well.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has done everything in its power to raise their
expectations. The airwaves are echoing with jingles promising
perfect online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most online retailers are merely pretty facades. Their
priority is to create a buzz (what Web retailers dignify as ``brand
building'') so as to attract traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, only 5-20 percent of their investment goes on
merchandising, logistics and fulfillment, estimates Keng Lim, boss
of Escalate, which provides back-office systems for Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Boo.com, a Swedish sports-fashion retailer, spent $100 million
on public relations and advertising before it had even freed its
Web site from bugs. Few Internet entrepreneurs have enough
retailing experience to build the logistics and customer management
that stand behind a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows how often I have been in a room with a 27-year-old
guy who can dream up a fancy Web site, but hasn't a clue about the
complexities of the back office,'' scoffs Harold Hughes, of
Pandesic, which sells computer systems to Web merchants.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem hopelessly shortsighted. Yet, according to the
received wisdom of the Internet, building a business in such a
lopsided way might be the clever _ and possibly the only _ thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Most online retailers believe they are in a sprint to gain
market share over Christmas. Send.com, an upmarket gift site, has
spent $20 million on marketing in the past eight weeks _ five times
its original budget.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lannon, its chief executive, thinks the strategy is
sound: ``I look at this like an election campaign. If the election
is in December it doesn't make sense to say in January, I wish we
had spent more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the two or three firms with the largest sales in their
niche will be able to raise fresh money next year. The rest are
likely either to fail or to be bought.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, even those that go bankrupt may succeed financially:
if a site has attracted a decent amount of traffic, a buyer may
think it worth enough to make its founders rich.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the approach is creating jerry-built companies.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm and consultancy, has
devised a measure of quality, called BetterWeb, which analyzes such
things as orders, returns and complaints.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 300 e-merchants it has surveyed passes muster.
Sometimes the lack of experience borders on naivete.
</P>
<P>
   Eve.com, a beauty-products site, tried to sell perfumes, only to
discover that these were classed as ``hazardous materials'' and
that to ship them via UPS required a license. That took months to
get.
</P>
<P>
   Most shortcomings are to do with computers and therefore harder
to fix. Even the best sites, such as eBay, are prone to crash or
are struggling to find skilled IT professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Others have fallen into the trap of buying software packages
that suited them when they were small, but which cannot be scaled
up to process larger volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Internet retailers racing towards Christmas have had
neither the time nor the money to build systems that can cope with
huge, unpredictable surges in web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most gruelling struggle is to tie together old
computer systems so as to link their Web sites to data banks and
warehouses. Only then can firms know what is in stock, guarantee
delivery times and let customers track orders.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Sharp, who left Microsoft to become the chief technology
officer at iTurf, a Web site and catalogue retailer for teenagers,
says that without integrated systems firms cannot assess what
people are doing on their site or the value of an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of technical experience will show how flaky many of these
companies are,'' he says, adding that proper integration can take
years.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they get their computer systems right, most online
retailers are ill-prepared for the difficulties of handling
thousands or millions of small, frequent and individual orders. &QL;

   Take toysmart.com, which is based in Massachusetts and is

educational toys _ no Barbies or Pokemons here _ and has built and
equipped a 150,000-square-foot warehouse in less than four months.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to its chaotic headquarters in Waltham trip over staff
and children strewn across the floor happily ``testing'' lego sets,
wooden trains and science kits (a favorite ``raises'' live
butterflies).
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart, which did more business in the first 30 hours of
December this year than in the whole of December 1998, is spending
more on its back office than most of its rivals, and has hired IT
and warehousing professionals from GTE and LL Bean.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it has had its glitches _ or ``gotchas'' as David
Lord, the chief executive, calls them. Some of these are easily put
right: the firm bought a new bank of printers to keep up with
demand for individual labels.
</P>
<P>
   More serious have been mismatches between stock on the Web site
and in the warehouse, because of delays in gaining approval for
credit cards and in checking handpicked orders.
</P>
<P>
   Clever electronics cannot solve every back-office glitch.
Although toysmart's warehouse is full of gleaming packing machines
and conveyor belts, there are no robots here. Every order is
assembled by hand using a system of codes that even an experienced
packer says takes ``ages'' to master.
</P>
<P>
   Pandesic's Hughes says that to meet the Christmas rush, many Web
retailers are employing ``tattooed musclemen'' to handle their
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Even toysmart's Lord is pressing his family, board directors and
local mothers to pick and wrap orders.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to outsource everything from customer service to
fulfillment. iTurf's chief executive, Steve Kahn, calls this
``dancing with the devil.'' He describes the group's flirtation
with outsourcing as a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There tends to be a conflict of interest, because the service
firm is trying to cut costs, whereas the online retailer wants
additional resources. &QL;

   Handspring, which makes handheld computers, is paying the price.
Its customers are being billed several times, and many have been
unable to cancel orders.
</P>
<P>
   In the Christmas rush, sites are building incomplete systems.
Without tools for customizing pages, software that can identify
frequent customers or e-mail systems that help customers get quick
answers, sites will lose visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, once a system is in place, it is hard to slot in new
features. And that is the real lesson from all the bodging and
jerry-building.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, online retailers need to construct more than just
bright Web sites made alluring by huge amounts of advertising. The
solution is to build top-notch distribution centers and warehouses.
But, as Amazon _ probably the best online retailer _ is
discovering, that is very expensive, indeed. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The shop is open, but you cannot get through the door
for the crowds flooding in from across the country. After you
finally squeeze inside, you have a question.
</P>
<P>
   A sales assistant asks you to write it down and tells you that
someone might reply _ after next Tuesday. You fill your shopping
basket anyway. At the till, however, the cashier removes several
items from your cart: ``Sorry, these are just for display. We are
sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, you discover your credit card has been charged anyway _
twice, in fact. And, mysteriously, your bag contains things you
have never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   You go back to the store to complain. The sales assistant has no
memory of who you are or of what you bought. He suggests you
auction your unwanted purchases on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would accept such treatment in a real shop. But Internet
shopping is blighted by overburdened Web sites without a precise
idea of their inventory, or of how to serve customers, or of when
deliveries will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas e-commerce was still a novelty, and customers
were willing to put up with all sorts of shortcomings. But with
sales expected to double to $6 billion this year, online shopping
is past being a prototype. Customers expect to be treated well.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has done everything in its power to raise their
expectations. The airwaves are echoing with jingles promising
perfect online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most online retailers are merely pretty facades. Their
priority is to create a buzz (what Web retailers dignify as ``brand

<P>
   Visitors to its chaotic headquarters in Waltham trip over staff
and children strewn across the floor happily ``testing'' lego sets,
wooden trains and science kits (a favorite ``raises'' live
butterflies).
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart, which did more business in the first 30 hours of
December this year than in the whole of December 1998, is spending
more on its back office than most of its rivals, and has hired IT
and warehousing professionals from GTE and LL Bean.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it has had its glitches _ or ``gotchas'' as David
Lord, the chief executive, calls them. Some of these are easily put
right: the firm bought a new bank of printers to keep up with
demand for individual labels.
</P>
<P>
   More serious have been mismatches between stock on the Web site
and in the warehouse, because of delays in gaining approval for
credit cards and in checking handpicked orders.
</P>
<P>
   Clever electronics cannot solve every back-office glitch.
Although toysmart's warehouse is full of gleaming packing machines
and conveyor belts, there are no robots here. Every order is
assembled by hand using a system of codes that even an experienced
packer says takes ``ages'' to master.
</P>
<P>
   Pandesic's Hughes says that to meet the Christmas rush, many Web
retailers are employing ``tattooed musclemen'' to handle their
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Even toysmart's Lord is pressing his family, board directors and
local mothers to pick and wrap orders.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to outsource everything from customer service to
fulfillment. iTurf's chief executive, Steve Kahn, calls this
``dancing with the devil.'' He describes the group's flirtation
with outsourcing as a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There tends to be a conflict of interest, because the service
firm is trying to cut costs, whereas the online retailer wants
additional resources. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,350) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Handspring, which makes handheld computers, is paying the price.
Its customers are being billed several times, and many have been
unable to cancel orders.
</P>
<P>
   In the Christmas rush, sites are building incomplete systems.
Without tools for customizing pages, software that can identify
frequent customers or e-mail systems that help customers get quick
answers, sites will lose visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, once a system is in place, it is hard to slot in new
features. And that is the real lesson from all the bodging and
jerry-building.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, online retailers need to construct more than just
bright Web sites made alluring by huge amounts of advertising. The
solution is to build top-notch distribution centers and warehouses.
But, as Amazon _ probably the best online retailer _ is
discovering, that is very expensive, indeed. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Has the millennium bug been crushed?
</P>
<P>
   The world must wait until Jan. 1 to see if all of those Y2K
projects have done the trick. But the nerds seem to have persuaded
us that disruption will not be serious and on New Millennium's Day,
life will carry on.
</P>
<P>
   That emerges from the latest world poll, carried out by Angus
Reid for The Economist. The Canadian polling firm interviewed
representative adult samples in 21 countries from mid-November to
early December _ nearly 12,000 respondents in all.
</P>
<P>
   We asked our sample group if they thought the bug would cause
``serious and widespread economic disruption'' in their country, or
``some economic disruption, but not serious'' or ``little or no
disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 7 percent, weighted by population, said they had never
heard of the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Though practically everyone knew about it in, say, America and
Hong Kong, 32 percent of Russians and 29 percent of Turks professed
total ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Others had heard of it, but were unsure of its likely
consequences. Overall, this was true of 6 percent of our sample.
</P>
<P>
   What follows ignores such answers and concentrates on the rest.
Globally, only 8 percent of those who have an opinion expect
widespread disruption in their own countries. However, a further 41
percent expect some economic damage.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, those expecting some trouble and those expecting none
are evenly balanced.
</P>
<P>
   The share of pessimists varies greatly. In America and Canada,
only 2 percent expect really serious trouble, as do 4 percent in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   However, widespread disruption is expected by 10 percent of
French, 12 percent of Japanese and 14 percent of Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia is also worried. In South Korea and Japan,
roughly three-quarters of those expressing a view expect at least
some damage.
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of planning, what matters is how people behave.
Will they refuse to fly? Will they refuse to buy? Might many
confine themselves to the safety of their own homes (if safe they
be)?
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the proportion saying that they will avoid nothing is a
high 68 percent. Again, the figure conceals large variations. For
example, 90 percent of Spaniards and 89 percent of Italians plan to
carry on as normal. By contrast, that is true of only 52 percent of
South Koreans, and 53 percent of Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some businesses are going to take a hit _
especially airlines. When asked if there was anything they would
avoid on millennium day, around a fifth of Americans and Canadians
volunteered that they would refuse to fly, despite their optimism
in this poll.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, very few Italians and no Spaniards would not fly.
</P>
<P>
   Very few people anywhere say they will not drive, use elevators,
or travel on trains and the underground.
</P>
<P>
   Our poll prompts one thought. The reaction against genetically
modified food has led to talk of a crisis of public confidence in
science. People are no longer, it is said, ready to trust the
experts when they assure the world.

 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has the millennium bug been crushed?
</P>
<P>
   The world must wait until Jan. 1 to see if all of those Y2K
projects have done the trick. But the nerds seem to have persuaded
us that disruption will not be serious and on New Millennium's Day,
life will carry on.
</P>
<P>
   That emerges from the latest world poll, carried out by Angus
Reid for The Economist. The Canadian polling firm interviewed
representative adult samples in 21 countries from mid-November to
early December _ nearly 12,000 respondents in all.
</P>
<P>
   We asked our sample group if they thought the bug would cause
``serious and widespread economic disruption'' in their country, or
``some economic disruption, but not serious'' or ``little or no
disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 7 percent, weighted by population, said they had never
heard of the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Though practically everyone knew about it in, say, America and
Hong Kong, 32 percent of Russians and 29 percent of Turks professed
total ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Others had heard of it, but were unsure of its likely
consequences. Overall, this was true of 6 percent of our sample.
</P>
<P>
   What follows ignores such answers and concentrates on the rest.
Globally, only 8 percent of those who have an opinion expect
widespread disruption in their own countries. However, a further 41
percent expect some economic damage.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, those expecting some trouble and those expecting none
are evenly balanced.
</P>
<P>
   The share of pessimists varies greatly. In America and Canada,
only 2 percent expect really serious trouble, as do 4 percent in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   However, widespread disruption is expected by 10 percent of
French, 12 percent of Japanese and 14 percent of Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia is also worried. In South Korea and Japan,
roughly three-quarters of those expressing a view expect at least
some damage.
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of planning, what matters is how people behave.
Will they refuse to fly? Will they refuse to buy? Might many
confine themselves to the safety of their own homes (if safe they
be)?
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the proportion saying that they will avoid nothing is a
high 68 percent. Again, the figure conceals large variations. For
example, 90 percent of Spaniards and 89 percent of Italians plan to
carry on as normal. By contrast, that is true of only 52 percent of
South Koreans, and 53 percent of Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some businesses are going to take a hit _
especially airlines. When asked if there was anything they would
avoid on millennium day, around a fifth of Americans and Canadians
volunteered that they would refuse to fly, despite their optimism
in this poll.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, very few Italians and no Spaniards would not fly.
</P>
<P>
   Very few people anywhere say they will not drive, use elevators,
or travel on trains and the underground.
</P>
<P>
   Our poll prompts one thought. The reaction against genetically
modified food has led to talk of a crisis of public confidence in
science. People are no longer, it is said, ready to trust the
experts when they assure the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for most people, the only reason to think that the bug is
safe is that experts say so. And, although events may prove the
scientists wrong, most people seem inclined to believe them.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, people can still be persuaded by scientists, provided
it is done right. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   To assess a diabetic's risk of heart disease, a doctor typically
takes a blood sample to look for biochemical telltales such as the
level of insulin.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional method certainly does not involve sitting the
patient down on a psychiatrist's couch to see if a glass of water
looks half empty or half full.
</P>
<P>
   The latter technique may, however, turn out to be as much to the
point as blood tests, because some new research suggests that
depressed diabetics are, quite literally, prone to getting their
hearts broken.
</P>
<P>
   This study, which is to be published in January's
``Atherosclerosis'' by Trevor Orchard, an epidemiologist at the
University of Pittsburgh, is one piece of a mosaic that
psychologists and epidemiologists have been fitting together over
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece is an answer to the question of why depressed
people seem particularly susceptible to infection.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that is emerging as the pieces fit together suggests
that the old tag ``a healthy mind in a healthy body'' frequently
needs to be inverted.
</P>
<P>
   An unhealthy mind can lead directly to an unhealthy body _ and
therefore another old medical tag ``treat the patient, not the
disease'' takes on a new significance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Orchard explored this interaction between mind and body
using data collected during the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes
Complications Study, which was designed to identify those factors
that worsen the health of people already suffering from diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``juvenile-onset'' (type-I) diabetes, these complications can
be as deadly as the ailment itself. Type-I diabetics cannot produce
insulin _ a hormone which regulates the level of sugar in the
blood. They must therefore inject themselves with insulin at
regular intervals or else risk coma or sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if this were not sobering enough, type-I diabetics also
have a tendency to suffer from early and severe arteriosclerosis, a
condition in which the walls of the blood vessels thicken and
harden.
</P>
<P>
   Arteriosclerosis of the coronary arteries is particularly
dangerous, for these vessels supply blood to the muscle of the
heart. As the coronary-artery walls narrow, the flow of nutrients
and oxygen to the heart slows, and coronary heart disease (CHD)
follows.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Orchard's analysis involved more than 600 diabetics, who
were examined at two-year intervals over six years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to undergoing the usual physiological tests, the
participants were also evaluated at the beginning of the study by
the ``Beck Depression Inventory.'' This test rates individual
symptoms of depression (such as pessimism, suicidal ideas, social
withdrawal and loss of libido).
</P>
<P>
   The more depressed a patient is, the more points he accumulates.
A patient's score on the Beck scale turned out to be a good
predictor of his eventual level of CHD _ better, indeed, than high
levels of blood sugar, the standard symptom of diabetic disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Those without CHD scored significantly lower than those with it.
And patients who developed angina, a painful heart condition
resulting from arteriosclerosis, had depression scores that were
nearly twice as high (12.2) as diabetics whose hearts stayed
healthy (6.6).
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics, of course, whether depressed or not, are seriously
ill people. But it has been known for a long time that people with
no serious illness other than depression are more likely to die
than those who are otherwise similar, but mentally healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their causes of death have some visible connection with
their disease _ suicide, violent accidents and drug abuse are high
on the list. But depressed patients also die more often than the
mentally healthy from ``natural'' causes such as pneumonia and
influenza. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 600, OR CONTINUE TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The question of why severely depressed patients suffer from
infections more often than the average person attracted the
attention of Gregory Miller, a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon
University, also in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal body, infectious organisms are met by a battalion of
cells known as lymphocytes. Some of these attack the invaders
directly. Others produce antibodies that gum them up. But the
immune systems of the severely depressed tend to mount a weaker
counterattack than those of the mentally fit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Miller and his colleagues think they have the explanation
for this immunological apathy. In the past, studies relating mental
depression to depression of the immune system have usually been
performed on patients stuck in hospital. This complicates matters,
because the mere fact of being in a hospital affects a patient's
mood and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dr. Miller studied 32 depressed women who were not in
hospital, and matched them with a control group of healthy women.
As he reports in the latest issue of ``Psychosomatic Medicine,''
lymphocytes from the depressed women responded much less than those
from the normal women when exposed to agents that induce
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for this relies on the observation that
depression is often accompanied by a hormonal imbalance in the
brain. The disease is associated with abnormal levels of
norepinephrine and estradiol, hormones that are known to help
regulate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Miller's results, however, showed that this biochemical
difference could not, by itself, account for the weakness of the
responses shown to infection by the depressed women. There must be
something else involved.
</P>
<P>
   When he and his colleagues started examining the women in
question, they found that the depressed subjects had very different
ways of life from the controls. They smoked more, drank more
caffeinated drinks, slept more fitfully, and exercised less.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps surprisingly, only one of these differences, that
in physical activity, proved to have a significant relationship
with lymphocyte production. Dr. Miller found that physical activity
accounted for about half of the difference in immunity between
depressed and normal women.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that exercise represents the first clear behavioral
link between depression and a dysfunctional immune system.
</P>
<P>
   If that speculation proves correct, encouraging depressed people
to exercise should help to protect them from illness _ and the
strange correlations between depression, pneumonia and influenza
may finally make some sense. &QL;

VALENZUELA HAS MORE BELIEVERS THIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ Pat Valenzuela and Laffit Pincay could be described as
opposites.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay has become thoroughbred racing's all-time leading jockey
by showing up every day thanks to his superhuman devotion to
physical fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela has squandered his Pincay-like talent in a series of
suspensions for absences related to his drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   So why were people rooting for Valenzuela as well as Pincay
during the recent Hollywood Park season, in which Pincay won the
riding title with 32 victories and Valenzuela was second with 28?
Because weeks into a comeback from a nearly two-year suspension _
his eighth since his 1989 Kentucky Derby victory aboard Sunday
Silence _ Valenzuela is convincing people that this time will be
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sincerity I haven't seen in the past,'' said Hall of
Fame jockey Gary Stevens, who has been critical of racing officials
for giving Valenzuela too many chances. ``That's a welcome change
for everybody. In the past, he'd come back sounding remorseful, and
after winning for two weeks, there'd be a cockiness. He seems to be
appreciative of the opportunity he's gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, 37, spent 25 days of his latest suspension in the
Los Angeles men's jail on an armed-robbery charge that proved
groundless. In September, shortly before the Oak Tree meet at Santa
Anita, he was granted an unusual, one-year, ``conditional'' license
by the California Horse Racing Board, and he had to sign an
agreement to submit to random drug and alcohol testing and continue
substance-abuse treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He finished out of the top 10 with nine wins (7 percent) at Oak
Tree before getting back in form at the Hollywood Park meet that
ended Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he'd make it when I first saw him,'' said
leading trainer Bob Baffert. ``He looked terrible on a horse. I
wasn't going to use him.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert wound up teaming with Valenzuela for three victories at
Hollywood Park, and will entrust the rider with the appropriately
named Straight Man in the Malibu Stakes as Santa Anita opens an
87-day season Sunday. Valenzuela will seek his first stakes victory
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``P. Val's showing you can never lose your talent,'' Baffert
said.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela knows this is his last chance. People see it in his
manner. Valenzuela has drawn a comparison between himself and Pat
Day, the Hall of Fame jockey who cleaned up his life after
embracing Christianity in the 1980s. The question is whether
Valenzuela can stay straight as long as Day has.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a peace within him, it seems,'' said Bob Meldahl, one
of Valenzuela's ex-agents, who books mounts for Pincay these days.
``If that's true, he's going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a different guy right now, a lot more humble,'' said Jim
Pegram, who was Valenzuela's agent in 1994-95. ``Before, you always
wondered how long it's going to last. I personally think he's got a
shot this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The opener: Breeders' Cup Classic winner Cat Thief, with Day
riding, drew the outside post against six other 3-year-olds for the
7-furlong Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sixth race on a noon program Sunday. The Malibu field,
from the rail out: Prime Timber, Painter, Five Star Day, Straight
Man, Love That Red, Desert Hero and Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   One-horse races: The year isn't over, and we already have a 1999
Eclipse Award winner. It's Silverbulletday, who received all the
votes in the 3-year-old fillies division. ``Finalists'' _ the top
three vote-getters in each division _ were revealed this week.
</P>
<P>
   Champions will be announced Jan. 17 at a dinner at the Beverly
Hilton. Voters faced a difficult decision on Horse of the Year, but
in most of the divisional Eclipse Awards it's easy to figure out
who'll be honored. I voted for Chilukki (2-year-old filly),
Charismatic (3-year-old), Beautiful Pleasure (older female),
Daylami (turf horse), Soaring Softly (turf female) and Artax
(sprint), and expect them to win.
</P>
<P>
   Only two categories inspired much debate. I went for Anees
(2-year-olds) and Victory Gallop (older male). A case can be made
for Greenwood Lake, winner of the Champagne and Remsen in New York,
over Anees, who made the Breeders' Cup Juvenile his only stakes
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenwood Lake shouldn't be rewarded for skipping the
Breeders' Cup while in good health. Trainer Nick Zito thinks he is
enhancing his colt's Kentucky Derby chances; fine he'll get his
prize on the first Saturday in May.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, the Gulfstream Park and Oaklawn handicap winner and a
factor throughout the year, could beat out Victory Gallop, retired
in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But Victory Gallop had the edge when he retired with an injury
after winning the two horses' only meeting in the Whitney, and
Behrens didn't win another race.
</P>
<P>
   As for Horse of the Year, I'm for Daylami, the Dubai-owned horse
whose only U.S. start produced the top performance of Breeders' Cup
day, a 2-length victory in the Turf. The other finalists are
sprinter Artax and Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   My votes in the two-legged categories: Jerry Bailey (jockey), D.
Wayne Lukas (trainer) and Mike Pegram (owner).
</P>
<P>
   The 11-month year: The National Thoroughbred Racing Association,
which runs the Eclipse Awards now, required ballots to be returned
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The past-performance charts for award contenders that were
mailed in late November didn't include last month's classy Turf
Festival at Hollywood Park and there was nothing to remind voters
that a handful of major races were to be run in December.
</P>
<P>
   The early voting isn't expected to affect results. But what
would have happened if Breeders' Cup Classic winner Cat Thief were
a stronger candidate for outstanding 3-year-old or Horse of the
Year? His scheduled start in the Malibu wouldn't count. How
embarrassing would that have been for the NTRA?
</P>
<P>
   The organization explains that the early voting was necessary
because of the earlier-than-usual date of the awards dinner. We're
past the point where the NTRA, designed to be racing's ``league
office,'' is impressing people with the mere fact of its existence.
</P>
<P>
   The Eclipse balloting is an example of the NTRA being more
interested in running things than in running them well. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Cuttino Mobley heard those words again, and after so many nights of
profanity, he sought to clean up the locker-room language.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets stared into the face of their biggest problem and
whipped it, pulling away down the stretch for a 105-89 win over the
Washington Wizards on Thursday before 14,841 at Compaq Center.
Mobley keyed the late run and finished with 20 points, his third
consecutive night of scoring 20 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, there was one last bit of unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about let's just stop talking about the fourth quarter?''
he said. ``How about that? Then you won't have to think about it.
Is that better?''
</P>
<P>
   But with a few more games like Thursday's, those ugly words went
from vulgar to poetry. The final quarter went from weakness to
strength. And there was little doubt what was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot all about it,'' Rockets guard Steve Francis said. ``I
didn't even think about the fourth quarter until way into it.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their other problems in the calamitous early season, the
Rockets had fallen 10 games on the wrong side of .500 largely
because of their inability to win the fourth quarter. In the
previous four games, the Rockets had averaged just 16.5 points on
30.5-percent shooting in the fourth quarter. They had managed just
11 points in two of their previous three fourth quarters, their
worst scoring periods of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But with the game on the line Thursday, the Rockets took command
down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good,'' Francis said of the fast finish. ``I was
really excited and happy we had a chance to do that. It started at
the beginning of the fourth quarter _ we recognized we just have to
continue playing the way we've been playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Matt Bullard nailed a 3-pointer, his fourth of the game,
to push the lead to seven. Suddenly, shooters who had been missing
were on target. Tough fast-break drives that in previous games had
produced blown layups were successful Thursday. And when the
Rockets needed to come up with the stops to take control of the
game, they held the Wizards to one field goal in a 5:17 stretch of
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Francis had made four of 14 shots when Bryce Drew passed to him
at the top of the key. Francis immediately nailed a trey. Drew
pulled up for a jumper and a nine-point lead. Mobley hit a pair of
free throws. Kenny Thomas added another. And when Mobley stripped
Mitch Richmond, he took off on a fast break, drawing a foul from
Michael Smith for a three-point play and a 90-78 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley found Kelvin Cato inside for a dunk, and the Rockets had
their largest lead, 93-78, with 4:49 left, completing a 13-4 run.
But the Rockets maintained they were better down the stretch
because they had executed more expertly all game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been practicing well on this,'' Cato said. ``We're
getting time to practice and practice. We ran the plays it took to
win the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets did not shoot well most of the night. They made just
43.8 percent of their shots. But the Rockets, the most
turnover-prone team in the NBA, had just 13. Of their 35 field
goals, 25 came on assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is stuff we've been working on, but I think we're getting
better at running all the different sets that we now have and it's
really helping our offense,'' Bullard said. ``We were able to get a
big win tonight _ win by a lot of points _ and I think guys are
getting into the offense. They're getting into the right places
earlier, and we're running the plays a lot crisper.''
</P>
<P>
   The best example might have been the last play of the decisive
fourth-quarter run, when Mobley drew a defender to him inside, then
found Cato. One game after Mobley was so critical of himself for
failing to effectively pass in traffic, he had five assists, three
on penetrations that ended with a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just basketball,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
``That's reading the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard had a season-high 16 points, making six of 11 shots and
four of six treys. Cato had 20 points in 39 minutes off the bench
and matched his career high with 12 rebounds. Thomas had 10
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, struggling with his shot much of the night _ he made
one of his first nine attempts _ had 11 assists without a turnover
and came on late to finish with 16 points. He left the court in the
final two minutes when his back stiffened, but the problem was
considered minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullard got us off to a good start,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I
thought the bench gave us a tremendous lift. A lot of guys played
well. I loved to see 13 turnovers for eight points. That's such a
big difference. I thought we did a pretty good job containing
(guard Rod) Strickland. Cato was active. Cuttino was outstanding.
And Steve, 11 assists. There were a lot of contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   And when they ignored the arrival of the fourth quarter, they
played one worth remembering.

CLIPPERS DEFEAT KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With more creative shuffling of the deck than
usual, a fistful of jokers can beat three Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who historically provide more talk-show punch
lines than the Clinton administration, survived a three-pronged
assault from Chris Webber (33 points), Corliss Williamson and Jason
Williams to hand Sacramento a 97-91 defeat Thursday night before
14,315 fans at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (8-18) prolonged assistant coach Jim Todd's winning
streak (two) that began Wednesday night in Oakland when head coach
Chris Ford surrendered to lower back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Hudson was their trump card against the Kings with 16
points, 10 assists and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the unofficial and typical conspiracy of
less-than-equitable officiating, the Clippers had to deal with
Lamar Odom jumping on the illness bandwagon. The rookie forward had
13 points, nine rebounds and four blocks, but accomplished these
numbers with rising flu symptoms. He attracted his second and
disqualifying technical foul at 7:48 left to play and the Clippers
juggling an 84-77 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Maurice Taylor, who missed the Golden State game with
an assist from the flu, returned at less than peak efficiency but
rallied for 14 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (14-10), who usually are more dangerous in transition
than Lon Chaney, almost did themselves in by coughing up 15
turnovers in the first half. Much of their technical difficulty was
registered by Williams, the flashiest thing we've seen out of
Sacramento since Jerry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Williams seemed more interested in trotting out his considerable
razzle-dazzle than efficiently slicing through the Clipper defense.
And Williams, who may be a bigger defensive liability than your
cousin Vinny, was butchered by Clipper Troy Hudson (12 points and
six assists in the first half).
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento's deadly subs the self-aware Bench Mob were
out-mobbed by the Clippers two-man gang of Keith Closs and Charles
Jones. Closs had nine points, six rebounds and two blocks in relief
of center Michael Olowokandi, while Jones had 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   With Webber spanking them for 13 points, the Clippers trailed,
29-22, after one quarter. But with Hudson smoking Williams and his
caddy former Clipper Darrick Martin the Clippers outscored the
Kings, 29-16, in round two and took a 51-45 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento cut into the lead by two in the third quarter, but
the Clips endured another Webber salvo to grab the win, their
fourth in six games.
</P>
<P>
   CLIPPERS NOTES: Todd, when pressed Friday for an ETA on Ford's
return, said, ``I was hoping for tonight.'' Oh, he doesn't mind the
responsibility of being in charge, but also appreciates the
expectations. ``It's a little different sitting in that seat. But
really, my job is to be an extension of the head coach.'' ... Since
Ford has been in L.A., Closs by poor choices on and off the court
has held down the job of heating up the bench. But Wednesday night
in Oakland, the 7-foot-3 backup center took advantage of the
diminished roster to earn 20 minutes, producing 10 points and eight
rebounds. ``It felt great being able to get up off the bench and
made positive contributions on the court ... get in the other
team's way,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To paraphrase a certain wartime prime minister, you
might say that Britain and the United States are two countries
divided by a common religious holiday.
</P>
<P>
   That is Christmas, except that you can't say Christmas here, of
course, for fear of offending non-Christians, for whom it is not a
holiday but a shopping opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a baffling time for expatriates and, it seems, for
some Americans also.
</P>
<P>
   Even the first lady hasn't quite got the nuances of the season
taped. My neighbor at a dinner the other night, recounted how she
had recently arranged a breakfast meeting for Hillary Rodham
Clinton in New York City among supporters and donors.
</P>
<P>
   After it was over, guests were lining up to complain to her
about Hillary's speech. She had mentioned Christmas no fewer than
six times, but had never once made reference to the Jewish holiday
of Hanukkah.
</P>
<P>
   This would have been clumsy from any speaker in New York in
December. But from Hillary _ who wants to be its senator _ it was
plain dumb.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner, by the way, was given by a British couple whose
friends are mostly Americans. They win the prize, by contrast, for
cross-cultural sensitivity. We were called to together to
``celebrate the festive season.''
</P>
<P>
   There was Christmas pudding and a vanilla mousse affair for
dessert and, for the main course, turkey but also scallops. (The
incineration of the pudding in a puddle of brandy evidently
astonished a Japanese couple at my table. They had mousse.)
</P>
<P>
   Cleverest of all was the carol-singing after dinner. Ushered
into a small salon with a grand piano and professional pianist
waiting, we received nineteen pages of our favorite Christmas
numbers with all their verses. But the favorites in America are
often completely unfamiliar to the British.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little shocking to realize that I was enjoying singing
the American numbers almost more than the ones I knew from English
school days. I think it must be the Bob Hope in me.
</P>
<P>
   Among those you might want to try at home (after a drink or
three) are: ``It's Beginning to Look Like Christmas,'' ``Winter
Wonderland,'' ``Rockin' Round the Christmas Tree'' and ``Let it
Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!''
</P>
<P>
   There was only one that we all felt compelled to sing twice _
``White Christmas'' (As in, ``I'm dreaming of...'').
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, I think I have got the lights more or less
right on our house. Draping your every down pipe and garden shrub
with thousands of tiny white bulbs is obligatory in the suburbs. I
swear they will be able to spot our road from the just-launched
shuttle. It doesn't just glow, it pulsates.
</P>
<P>
   I am pleased with myself, because I have finally twigged to the
labor-saving magic of those little timers normally used to switch
lamps on and off to trick burglars when you are away.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two sets of lights snaking around our home can look
after themselves at dusk and midnight. No more traipsing out in the
snow in underwear at bedtime to pull out plugs from soggy outdoor
sockets, risking electrocution.
</P>
<P>
   I am proud of one friend, who is resolutely keeping her house
dark this year. The neighbors, she says, can lump it. But then, she
is in a funk generally.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with sulky, adolescent offspring, she is also refusing to
trim a Christmas tree that stands ready in her sitting room,
expectant but entirely naked.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the right Christmas tree is a whole other challenge. I
am not sure if it is genetic engineering, but the trees here are
simply fuller and shapelier than the sorry twigs I remember in
England. But the pressure is on every year to find the perfect
specimen.
</P>
<P>
   We have failed this time _ the tree's skirt is a little narrow.
We got it from among hundreds piled outside our local church.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, we have driven to a tree farm to tramp around in
forests of the things with a saw. This is invariably miserable.
Undergrowth obscures the trees and last year my wife took a slice
from our son's nose.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, we will try a different farm that chops the trees for
you and hangs them from a wooden frame like so many turkeys. Then
you can study their profile without hindrance.
</P>
<P>
   We have tripped up in our search for an organic turkey also.
When we rang the wonderful delicatessen that is near the Vermont
house where we will be spending Christmas itself, they told us that
they weren't doing turkeys this year.
</P>
<P>
   I suggested to them that this was a little eccentric. They
replied that the local farm that supplies them simply has none left
_ all of their birds were eaten at Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, here is this year's 100 percent politically-correct
seasonal greeting: ``Have a Merry Millennium.'' &QL;

 By GEOFFREY LEAN  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia and America are starting up an unprecedented joint early
warning system this week, amid fears that the millennium ``bug''start a nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   Top brass from both sides will watch missile warning screens
side by side in a specially constructed building until a week after
the new year.
</P>
<P>
   They will try to detect false alarms from computer glitches, and
avoid launching nuclear strikes in response.
</P>
<P>
   But leading experts _ including Nobel Peace Prize-winners and
one of America's most distinguished bomb designers _ says this does
not go far enough, and are campaigning for Presidents Yeltsin and
Clinton to deactivate their nuclear arsenals over the turn of the
year. They say that the dangers have been made even greater by the
tensions over the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The two superpowers have 4,400 nuclear weapons _ more than
enough to destroy the world _ ready to be launched at a moment's
notice.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, experts say, false alarms generated by faulty
equipment have caused an alarming number of near misses: on one
occasion a poorly designed chip, costing just 64 cents, deep in the
U.S. Defense Department's telephone switchboard hardware, started
sending out signals that a Soviet attack was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Last year an authoritative report concluded that there could be
``no confidence'' that the Pentagon would get its systems ready for
Y2K, as the millennium bug is known in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Though the U.S. has enormously improved its preparedness since,
experts say that no one can be certain that its systems are 100
percent fool-proof; and there is acute alarm about Russia's
decaying nuclear control system.
</P>
<P>
   This Wednesday some 20 senior Russian officers joined a similar
number of Americans at a specially built ``Center for Y2K
Stability'' in Colorado Springs, Colo., near the U.S. early warning
command center deep in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The center will become fully operational on Dec. 28 and from
then until Jan. 7 two Russian officers and two Americans will sit
side by side around the clock, with hotlines to their respective
command centers.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, which has echoes of the admission of a Russian
general to the U.S. war room in the film ``Dr. Strangelove,'' is
modeled on the shared system of air-traffic control used in Berlin
during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But experts insist that the chances of an accidental war remain.
Sir Joseph Rotblat, a member of the wartime Manhattan Project, who
won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 for his work on nuclear
disarmament, told The Independent on Sunday: ``You cannot exclude
the possibility that something may go wrong. The probability of it
may be very slight, but the consequences would be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Ted Taylor, who was one of the U.S.'s most senior bomb
designers, adds: ``No one can estimate the risk. It may be one in
10 or one in 1,000, but it is certainly there.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that keeping nuclear weapons on red alert after the end
of the Cold War ``may be one of the biggest mistakes humans have
ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   Both have joined the campaign led by Dr. Helen Caldicott, the
founding president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, which
is trying to persuade the leaders of both superpowers to deactivate
their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say that the danger is not that nuclear weapons will
launch themselves automatically, but that the millennium bug will
cause false alarms and shorten the 15 minutes in which a decision
has to be taken on whether to launch a retaliatory strike.
</P>
<P>
   With tensions between Russia and the United States at their
highest for years, even the joint control center may not overcome
the mistrust, they say. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia and America are starting up an unprecedented joint early
warning system this week, amid fears that the millennium ``bug''
could start a nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   Top brass from both sides will watch missile warning screens
side by side in a specially constructed building until a week after
the new year.
</P>
<P>
   They will try to detect false alarms from computer glitches, and
avoid launching nuclear strikes in response.
</P>
<P>
   But leading experts _ including Nobel Peace Prize-winners and
one of America's most distinguished bomb designers _ says this does
not go far enough, and are campaigning for Presidents Yeltsin and
Clinton to deactivate their nuclear arsenals over the turn of the
year. They say that the dangers have been made even greater by the
tensions over the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The two superpowers have 4,400 nuclear weapons _ more than
enough to destroy the world _ ready to be launched at a moment's
notice.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, experts say, false alarms generated by faulty
equipment have caused an alarming number of near misses: on one
occasion a poorly designed chip, costing just 64 cents, deep in the
U.S. Defense Department's telephone switchboard hardware, started
sending out signals that a Soviet attack was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Last year an authoritative report concluded that there could be
``no confidence'' that the Pentagon would get its systems ready for
Y2K, as the millennium bug is known in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Though the U.S. has enormously improved its preparedness since,
experts say that no one can be certain that its systems are 100
percent fool-proof; and there is acute alarm about Russia's
decaying nuclear control system.
</P>
<P>
   This Wednesday some 20 senior Russian officers joined a similar
number of Americans at a specially built ``Center for Y2K
Stability'' in Colorado Springs, Colo., near the U.S. early warning
command center deep in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The center will become fully operational on Dec. 28 and from
then until Jan. 7 two Russian officers and two Americans will sit
side by side around the clock, with hotlines to their respective
command centers.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, which has echoes of the admission of a Russian
general to the U.S. war room in the film ``Dr. Strangelove,'' is
modeled on the shared system of air-traffic control used in Berlin
during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But experts insist that the chances of an accidental war remain.
Sir Joseph Rotblat, a member of the wartime Manhattan Project, who
won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 for his work on nuclear
disarmament, told The Independent on Sunday: ``You cannot exclude
the possibility that something may go wrong. The probability of it
may be very slight, but the consequences would be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Ted Taylor, who was one of the U.S.'s most senior bomb
designers, adds: ``No one can estimate the risk. It may be one in
10 or one in 1,000, but it is certainly there.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that keeping nuclear weapons on red alert after the end
of the Cold War ``may be one of the biggest mistakes humans have
ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   Both have joined the campaign led by Dr. Helen Caldicott, the
founding president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, which
is trying to persuade the leaders of both superpowers to deactivate
their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say that the danger is not that nuclear weapons will
launch themselves automatically, but that the millennium bug will
cause false alarms and shorten the 15 minutes in which a decision
has to be taken on whether to launch a retaliatory strike.
</P>
<P>
   With tensions between Russia and the United States at their
highest for years, even the joint control center may not overcome
the mistrust, they say. &QL;

S.F. STORES SAY HOLIDAYS ARE BOOM TIMES FOR SHOPLIFTERS  
 
 
 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID LAZARUS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ 'Tis the season for sticky fingers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   While San Francisco retailers are enjoying robust sales as
Christmas fast approaches, they also say that shoplifting is
rampant in their stores.
</P>
<P>
   And, with varying degrees of resignation, they say there's
little they can do to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to assume that everyone who walks into the store
is a potential shoplifter,'' said Angela Coffey, merchandising
manager at the J. Crew outlet in the downtown San Francisco
Shopping Centre. ``You try and watch them all, but it's not always
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to pick your battles,'' she said. ``You're not going
to worry about $10 hair accessories when you have $200 cashmere
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then _ and this is something most retailers don't want you
to know _ the unwritten rule is that if a shoplifter makes it out
the door with an item, it's pretty much history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're told not to chase,'' Coffey said. ``It's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, shoplifting has been in decline in recent years.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, there were 2,996
reported incidents in 1996, 2,788 in 1997 and 2,467 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, merchants, business groups, the district
attorney's office and even the police say shoplifting is on the
rise. The only thing that is down, they say, is the number of shops
actually reporting thefts to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many retailers have made the determination that it's not cost
effective to seek prosecution,'' said Bruce Van Kleeck, vice
president of the National Retail Federation in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to pull people off the job for court
appearances and paperwork,'' he said. ``It's a business decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchants also say that in some cases stores fear being hit by a
lawsuit if the suspected shoplifter insists that an honest mistake
was made.
</P>
<P>
   For many merchants, a certain degree of theft _ or ``inventory
shrinkage'' in retail-industry parlance _ is simply accepted as the
price of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   It is the flip side of the booming U.S. economy. More money in
circulation compels merchants to place more items on the floor to
attract shoppers. But more items on the floor also make for a more
tempting target for those disposed to take a five-finger discount.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Johnson, a spokesman for the San Francisco district
attorney's office, said shoplifting is ``way up'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it up, the shoplifters are getting bolder,'' he
said. ``They're walking out with bigger and bigger items. There's
no attempt to conceal. They just grab them and walk.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager of one store in the San Francisco Shopping Centre,
who requested anonymity, observed that shoplifters are growing
bolder because they know that the consequences of being caught are
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoplifters know the laws better than the merchants,'' he
said. ``They know that even if they get arrested, they'll be out in
two hours.''
</P>
<P>
   He glanced around his own shop, an outlet for a national
clothing chain. There was no guard on duty, no cameras visible on
the walls or ceiling. There weren't even security tags on the
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had guys who took things, got caught, and three hours
later they were back,'' the store manager said. ``You just can't do
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on whether the store is interested in
cooperating,'' said Jim Deignan, a spokesman for the Police
Department. Some retailers, he said, have declined to pursue
arrests even when a shoplifter has been caught red-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be running from store to store all day if shoplifting did
get reported,'' said Officer Al Melendez, who patrols Union Square.
``But it doesn't. The actual amount of shoplifting going on _ I
can't even imagine the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Melendez cited the example of a repeat offender that he called
``Pockmark Face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy goes to Brooks Brothers three times a week,''
Melendez said. ``Each time, he grabs a stack of shirts and runs out
of the store. The salespeople never report it.''
</P>
<P>
   All merchants interviewed said stores in downtown San Francisco
are hit more frequently by slick ``professional'' shoplifters as
opposed to teenagers making off with small items.
</P>
<P>
   They said shoplifters will typically case a store several times
to gauge the level of security. ``If the shoplifter sees a lot of
new faces among the staff, they'll feel more confident,'' one store
manager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also see more of them working in teams, where one will make
a distraction while the other takes items,'' she said. ``Or they
come in with an entire family and pass the items to a child. We're
not going to accuse a 5-year-old child.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Wallace, president of the Bay Area Better Business Bureau,
agreed that shoplifters are growing more sophisticated in their
methods as stores struggle to keep pace by adopting more advanced
security measures.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bay Area bureau has yet to study shoplifting in
detail, the nationwide Council of Better Business Bureaus points to
a recent study commissioned by the Louisville, Ky., branch.
</P>
<P>
   It found that U.S. businesses lose an estimated $16 billion a
year to shoplifting, and that one-third of all new enterprises fail
because of retail theft (often committed by employees).
</P>
<P>
   It also found that while adolescents account for nearly half of
all shoplifting, they make off with only a third as much as their
adult counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Mattingly, president of the Louisville Better Business
Bureau, said many stores are responding by investing in additional
cameras, electronic sensors and security personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these things are expensive,'' he said, ``and consumers end
up paying the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly estimated that as much as 3 percent of an item's
retail cost reflects the store's security expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of stores at the San Francisco Shopping Centre
employ their own guards. Most rely instead on salespeople keeping
an eye out for potential shoplifters.
</P>
<P>
   At American Eagle Outfitters on the ground floor, a display
table full of colorful fleece pullovers sits just inside the
entrance. A thief could be out the door with one in just two steps.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyenne Santos, whose blue blazer and gray slacks instantly
mark him as a security guard, said he watches customers' eyes and
hands, ``and the way they come in and touch things.''
</P>
<P>
   But if one of those customers suddenly grabbed an item and
bolted for the door, he said, he would probably do little if
anything to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to let people go,'' Santos said. ``If I go after
them and they get hit by a car, my company would be liable.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Crew's Coffey essentially conceded that if a shoplifter is
determined to walk out of a store with stolen goods, he or she will
probably get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, some thieves add insult to injury by coming back to
return unwanted items.
</P>
<P>
   ``The professionals take things into the fitting room and use a
garden tool to remove sensors,'' Coffey said. ``They come back
later with the same things. Then they try and get store credit for
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   She shook her head. ``It's frustrating.''

RESOLUTIONS FOR A NEW MILLENNIUM  &HT;     
   
  
</HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT OSTLER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's been a good millennium. Some of man's greatest achievements:
<P>
   The Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The Industrial Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Catch.
</P>
<P>
   If I left out anything important, contact me at the Column
Correction Hotline. Sorry about giving out the wrong number last
time. My bad.
</P>
<P>
   Operators are standing by to misdirect your call or sell you
infomercial items that Steve Garvey guarantees will shrink your
waistline and/or shine your car.
</P>
<P>
   If you are put on hold, please enjoy ``Ravi Shankar's Greatest
Hits Volume III,'' and be assured that your call is very important
to us (and to Ravi, who gets royalties).
</P>
<P>
   The operators have been swamped with calls from readers who
caught my recent reference to ``pasta pazool'' in the Dean Martin
song ``That's Amore.'' It turns out that Deano was actually singing
about pasta  &LR; fazool,  &LR; which is slang for pasta a fagioli, which is
pasta and beans.
</P>
<P>
   A pasta pazool, of course, is the edible festive hat worn by
Italian Shriners.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; BY THE WAY,  &LR; Merry Fill-in-the-Blank.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't everyone wear a badge during this season, indicating
his or her Big Holiday of choice? Save us the agony of selecting
the appropriate greeting.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it's Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah, but what is
Kwanzaa's favored adjective? Have yourself a kooky little Kwanzaa?
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful thing is, although we all go our separate
ethnic/cultural/religious ways to celebrate our holidays, Sunday we
will all be re-united as the Family of Man in the gift-return
lines, praying together that we brought the right receipts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; THEN COMES Y2K,  &LR; which will be even more festive than the other Big
Holidays, because computer glitches will wipe out all your credit
card debt.
</P>
<P>
   You would be foolish not to max out all your credit cards, trust
me. If you don't do it, don't come to me on January 2 begging to
borrow my new Maserati.
</P>
<P>
   The new millennium scares me a bit, though. You can't treat it
like just another new year. You can't make New Year's resolutions,
you have to make New Millennium resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   I will lose so much weight that when I cut in a theater line, a
guy behind me will shout, ``Hey, Gandhi, get your bony ass in the
back of the line!'' I will cure a major disease, or catch one,
whichever comes first. I will play shortstop for the Yankees. I
will vacuum under the back seat of my car.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WE ALL  &LR; feel compelled to celebrate this New Year's extra hard. We
will wear gaudier and more festive lamp shades. Many of us will
stagger into the new millennium as Pukemon.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us won't make it. Reportedly, members of one doomsday
cult are coming to San Francisco to commit mass suicide by using
crosswalks.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, if you drink too much on New Millennium Eve, when it's
time to go home, stand on a street corner and hail a cab. You won't
get one, but your efforts will provide a lot of hilarious
entertainment for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; ALREADY  &LR; I miss the old millennium, and some of the stuff that will
get left behind due to limited space in the lifeboats.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Macarena. Not the Macarena as performed by drunken fat
guys at basketball games, but the slinky, sensuous real thing. My
wife could do a mean Macarena.
</P>
<P>
   I worry that the new millennium, despite all the hype, will be a
disappointment, that it will be the old millennium with a coat of
cheap paint that we won't notice until we lean against it.
</P>
<P>
   What if we wake up on Jan. 1 and we don't have buns of steel and
a new Harley and a boss who suddenly understands our quirky genius?
</P>
<P>
   What if the rich are still way too rich, and the busiest hotel
in town is still the Market Street Sidewalk Inn?
</P>
<P>
   What if, despite shock therapy and a new regimen of
pogo-stick-aerobics, the same nonsense continues to flow from these
very fingertips on this very keyboard? Another long millennium with
no Pulitzer?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; THERE'S GOOD REASON  &LR; to celebrate the New, Improved Mil, of course:
</P>
<P>
   Because we can. We're here. Assuming, of course, that turns out
to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, we have survived a half century in which hundreds of
reality-challenged, power-crazed, thin-skinned world leaders sat
with twitching index fingers poised over red buttons. By all
rights, the planet should by now be a lump of smoking coal.
</P>
<P>
   In America, we have created a nation that annoys a lot of
people, including many Americans. We have rubbed many people the
wrong way, and now they want to rub back. So be careful. If a
stranger asks you to hold what appears to be a bowling ball with a
sizzling fuse, you'll know you've watched too many cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I'm taking the rest of the century off (not counting this
column). I plan to climb to the top of a Himalayan mountain and do
some deep meditation and soul searching, but of course I will still
be receiving cell calls, e-mail, voice mail, faxes, beeper
messages, telegrams and bills.
</P>
<P>
   And to you, dear reader _ loyal, devoted, accidental or
otherwise: My best wishes for a wacky Whatever, my profound and
groveling gratitude, and a tip of the old pasta pazool.

CHILD SAVED AS NEIGHBOR DOUSES FIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Lisa Van Proyen  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A suburban Los Angeles man is being hailed as a
hero after he saved a 3-year-old boy's life by racing into a
smoke-filled apartment to douse a Christmas tree fire with buckets
of water.
</P>
<P>
   Gerardo Perez said he heard a child's screams Wednesday night
and saw 15-foot flames leaping from an upstairs apartment. An
electrical short in Christmas lights had sparked a fire that
consumed the tree, presents and living room, overwhelming the
toddler with smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking. I was just trying to get the child out and
at that moment, you don't think, you just react,'' Perez said,
nursing a burn to his shoulder on his own without medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 33, deflected the praise, saying instead that many people
from the apartment complex worked to extinguish the blaze. He also
noted that 11-year-old Daniel Garcia had returned to the apartment
to rescue his 3-year-old brother, Arturo Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of the Garcia family credited him with saving the
children and the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the one who saved him. My aunt tried to get him out, but
the smoke was too intense. He took his shirt off and went in with
buckets of water. We're glad that he did this for us,'' said Carlos
Ontiveros, a cousin of the two injured boys.
</P>
<P>
   The toddler was not burned, but was overcome by smoke and
remained in critical condition Thursday afternoon with
life-threatening injuries to his lungs at Valley Presbyterian
Hospital, a hospital official said.
</P>
<P>
   His brother was also under treatment for smoke inhalation and in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The Garcias had lived in the second-floor apartment in the 8800
block of Langdon Avenue for six months and at the time of the fire
were readying for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very sad for them,'' said Daniel Pomposo, 12, who lives
below the Garcias.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said they plan to buy the Garcia family gifts, things
they need most due to losses in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could probably try to make up for their Christmas. Having
two kids in the hospital at Christmas is traumatic ... We will try
to make their Christmas more meaningful,'' said a neighbor,
Josefina Fuentes.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal began about 8 p.m. when the tree burst into flames.
As Perez made his way up to the apartment, he said he heard,
``Mommy! mommy!''
</P>
<P>
   The toddler was in the middle of the living room next to a
Christmas tree, but Perez couldn't see him through the thick smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Perez furiously grabbed buckets from neighbors, who filled them
from a pool as others called 911.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway inside the living room, Perez dumped the water
near the tree, getting within a few feet of flames, burning his
shoulder. As the flames consumed the tree, the Christmas presents
at its base, and the rest of the living room, about 15 neighbors
battled the blaze, grabbing fire extinguishers and using a hose
from the first floor to douse flames through the window, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a woman screaming that her son was trapped inside. I
felt helpless,'' said Ricardo Recinos, who was baby-sitting his
1-year-old nephew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christmas lights were popping. I could feel the heat way
over here. It was pretty intense for a small house fire,'' Recinos

   The older brother managed to escape from the burning apartment
with his mother, Angeles Garcia. But minutes later, after Perez and
others had put out most of the flames, the older teary-eyed brother
grabbed a flashlight out of a neighbor's hand and rushed into the
smoke-filled apartment to rescue his younger brother, family and
neighbors said. ``He pulled my flashlight out of my hand and ran
inside looking for his brother. I believe it was him who brought
him out,'' Fuentes said.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing neighbors knew, the two brothers were outside the
apartment with their mother by their side. And the firefighters
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes and at least a dozen other neighbors praised one another
for their quick actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never underestimate what kind of neighbors you have.
Today, it's for you, tomorrow it will be for me,'' Fuentes said.
``I feel real proud of my neighbors.''

CHOOSING THE RIGHT STAINLESS STEEL SINK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 26, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We are looking at stainless steel kitchen sinks and other
kitchen items for our house. One store said that the differences in
stainless steel sinks for sale is the amount of nickel in the
steel. Another store said the difference is in the weight. Who's
right?
</P>
<P>
   GALE BATSIMM, North Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think I am on the side the store that mentioned nickel
content as an indication of stainless steel quality. It is the
quality of the steel, not its weight, that counts, although a heavy
sink is better than a light one.
</P>
<P>
   More important, there are two types of stainless steel. One day
recently the handyman got himself into a mess by declaring that if
stainless steel rusts, it is not stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Two readers pointed out that there are two kinds of
stainless steel. Here is how Arthur Rosen of Randolpoh put it:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two series (groups) of stainless steels; the 300 and
400 series. Although both are considered stainless steel, their
materialscontent and method of manufacture are different. One
easily identifiable difference between the two series is that the
300 series is non-magnetic and will not rust whereas the 400 series
is magnetic and can rust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although most `stainelss steel' sinks are made of the
non-rusting 300 series stainless steel, it is possible that some
sinks have been made with the 400 series. I suggest you have your
reader check the sink with a magnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible to make even the 300 series stainless steels
magnetic under cartain circumstances. Improper welding techniques
and/or mechanical work with, say, a grinder, will make the area of
the sink that was welded and/or ground become magnetic.''
</P>
<P>
   So, with this information, the handyman suggests you opt for a
300 series sink. And, the heavier and more expensive, the better,
but it does not necessarily have to be the top price.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My shower pads (floors of the stalls) are made of some kind
of stone and binder, very smooth and shiny. Parts of them are
turning black. They are OK dry, but when wet, they are black, but
only where people stand in the shower. How can I clean up that
black?
</P>
<P>
   BRUCE TRUESDALE, Nantucket, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Those shower floors are most likely terrazzo, a ground stone
with binder, then smoothed and polished. I think the finish is worn
just a bit where people stand, enough to get dirty. The dirt is
ground in and looks worse when the floor is wet.
</P>
<P>
   To fix it, make a strong solution of Spic and Span and water,
add a cup of household bleach to the solution, soak the floor with
this solution and let it stand for 5 or 10 minutes (so it can do
its work), then scrub and rinse. When it dries, apply one or more
coats of a masonry sealer or tile sealer; repeat this once a year.
This will make the terrazzo water resistant, and may correct the
problem. If nothing seems to work, you could tile the floor with
glazed ceramic tile, using a thin-set mortar.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My problem is with a second-floor balcony, one that sticks
out of the wall with no support under it. Water comes in
over/under/around the door threshold in driving rain, leaking to
the bathroom below. We removed the flashing under the threshold and
noticed that there was no caulking. We then caulked that area, and
the problem is about 90 percent better, but still water is coming
in. What can we do?
</P>
<P>
   MELISSA BUOYMANN, Machias, Maine
</P>
<P>
   A. The balcony is sturdy, set on lookout joists, which are
simply an extension of the floor joists through the wall to as far
as the balcony edge, which in your case is four feet. I will bet
that the threshold is just an inch or so above the balcony floor,
and therein lies the problem. A door entering onto a balcony should
have a full step down from threshold to balcony floor, which is
about 7 1/2 inches. This step will allow flashing to keep out
windblown rain.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less is inadequate, although you could raise the door 7
1/2 inches; that is fussy work, but possible. Adding to your
problem is the possibility of rain going through the balcony floor
and running down the wall between the joists, causing more leaks.
</P>
<P>
   A possible cure, if you do not raise the door: For the
threshold, caulk the joint directly under the threshold and
anywhere else you think water is coming in. Nail copper or aluminum
flashing on the wall immediately under the threshold (sill), and
fold it so a bit of it is lying on the balcony floor. This will
allow water that hits it to drip down onto the floor and drip
harmlessly away, windblown or not.
</P>
<P>
   And, check the outside wall under the balcony, between those
lookout joists; that wall should be weatherproof to resist
windblown rain, which is frequent since your house, as you said,
faces the ocean, right on the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of water is the bottom of the door. Make sure it
is well sealed. If not, install a moving threshold, one that pops
up when the door is opened and pops down to form a tight seal when
it is closed.
</P>
<P>

IMPROVING THEIR WORLD IS BACK `IN' AT TUFTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 26, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fruits of liberty that Americans enjoy, and help spread
across the planet, were planted and flourished in the rich soil of
democracy. But history has recorded the decay of democracies as
well as the blissful ripening of ours.
</P>
<P>
   As the millennium beckons, more people are looking forward
rather than back. But on the campus of Tufts University in Medford,
the doleful pronouncement of Edward Gibbon over ancient Athens, the
America of its day, is not only heard but heeded.
</P>
<P>
   As recounted by professor Brian O'Connell, Gibbon's ``Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire'' gave this epitaph for once-mighty
Athenians after they became corrupted by indolence, greed, and
immorality: ``In the end, more than they wanted freedom, they
wanted security. They wanted a comfortable life, and they lost it
all _ security, comfort and freedom . . . when the Athenians
finally wanted not to give to society, but for society to give to
them, when the freedom they wished for most was freedom from
responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it happen here? Without question.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is now the longest-running democracy in
history, as well as the richest and most powerful, and with the
most widely shared prosperity. But how do we keep it? John
DiBiaggio, the president of Tufts, is convinced you make a down
payment on preserving democracy by educating college kids as to
what it takes. Now the university's board of trustees has embraced
the notion, voting to launch the loftily titled University College
of Citizenship and Public Service. The idea is to promote the
notion of ``giving back'' and ``a desire to make the world a better
place,'' according to the trustees' minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And because DiBiaggio (eight years at Tufts, 14 years as
president at the University of Connecticut and Michigan State) is
currently head of both the American Council on Education, higher
ed's largest umbrella group of 3,500 colleges, and the Campus
Compact, a group of 700 schools committed to community action,
there's a chance that the bonfire lit at Tufts may catch on
elsewhere. The goal is to imbue in every Tufts student _ each of
the 4,800 undergrads plus the graduate students in various
disciplines _ the ethic of citizen involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts has mounted a good start; 1,000 students already take part
in a broad array of community activism ranging from AIDS to
environmental causes. But the new scheme envisions two or three
years of run-up to the hoped-for goal of commandeering $35 million
in new gifts to launch a university-wide, full-court press on the
philosophy of active citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Do not count DiBiaggio among those who see the 1960s through
rose-colored glasses. In a recent interview he ticked off the
excesses of that era: ``Kids had no input in decision-making then,
and no due process. For the kids in the '60s and '70s, it was not
just about civil rights or the Vietnam War. We put nonsense courses
in their curriculum and we inflated their grades.'' That triggered
cynicism and disengagement, he argues. ``Then they became very
apathetic and focused on themselves. Now, there's a rebirth.''
</P>
<P>
   So citizen involvement will become ``a hallmark of Tufts
education across all our degrees,'' said Dean Robert Hollister.
``Our focus on civic leadership and our across-the-curriculum
commitment sets this initiative apart from the efforts of other
colleges and universities.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBiaggio reckons sensitivity to civic concerns can be fragile
and expire easily. ``In the '80s, the first time we saw homeless
people in the streets since the Depression, we were shocked. Now,
we brush by them, don't even know they are there.'' What Tufts can
do about that, and about the erosion of all sorts of democratic
bulwarks, is recommit its campus to the ethic of citizenship, of
responsibility to a meaning larger than one's own paycheck or
401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 15 percent of the 18- to 25-year-olds voted in the last
election,'' he said. So it will take more than just some subtle
pushing in the direction of more volunteerism, he said. ``We can't
let it just be that. There's got to be some meaning in it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the redrawn game plan, students in every course
and discipline will be steered to the relevance of what they are
learning to real life in real places. Engineering students studying
environmental remediation, for instance, will be assigned real
chores in cleaning up a brownfields site. ``They have to translate
what they're doing,'' said DiBiaggio, from the classroom to the
community.
</P>
<P>
   There are successful examples aplenty. There are 25 students in
the Tufts Literacy Corps. Others go on ``Volunteer Vacation''
during spring break to build housing for Habitat for Humanity.
``Our medical students are more altruistic, less materialistic;
it's a wonderful shift,'' he enthuses.
</P>
<P>
   This is student-driven, Hollister said. Two-thirds of incoming
students in a survey asked that community service be a structured
part of their university life. O'Connell sees the shift as a return
to notions of citizenship that were more deeply ingrained at
midcentury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 50 years we've pretty much phased out anything
like civics or citizen education from schools and colleges,''
O'Connell said. When the Department of Education surveyed high
school students, 4 out of 10 flunked even the basic concepts, he
said. ``A hundred years ago, one of the primary goals of a college
education was to prepare them to be community leaders and active
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   But we began trimming back, to load up on science and vocational
courses. ``We're forgetting that democracy depends on the degree to
which citizens are prepared.'' This is why Plato took a dim view of
democracy, when the lowest common denominator of the rabble could
elect leaders who promised them the easy life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now the longest-lived democracy in the history of the
world,'' O'Connellsaid. ``It's provided us more liberty and
opportunity than any nation known, and no institution can presume
that preserving this democracy for those who come after us is
someone's else's business.''

RETIREEE WITH MINIMAL FINANCIAL NEEDS IN GOOD POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 26, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am married, age 64 and would like to retire about midway
through next year. I will have income of $74,400 from pensions and
$25,600 from two rental properties. I would also like to have
income of $20,000 a year from my investments, which would be used
to accelerate mortgage payments so my home mortgage and those on
the rental properties would be paid off in six years. The
investments include a $260,000 410(k) plan, from one employer, a
$125,000 401(k) with another employer, and a $30,000 account in
four mutual funds. Nearly all of the accounts are in stock funds or
stocks. How would you suggest I consolidate the portfolio either
for early payment of the mortgages or payment over the traditional
mortgage course, which would take 10 years? How might I make the
transition from pre-retirement to post-retirement assets?
</P>
<P>
   K.K., San Diego,
</P>
<P>
   A. I think youre in a good position to make no transition at
all. Since your pensions and rental income stream are sufficient to
supply all the money you need to live on, you can treat the entire
investment portfolio as long-term reserves. You would require a
total return of only 4.82 percent to support withdrawals of $20,000
a year during the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   Although I consistently look down on the idea of drawing an
income stream from a stock-dominated portfolio when the investor is
counting on stock market gains to support the withdrawals, in your
case your needs are so small and your savings sufficiently large
that assuming the risk seems very sensible to me.
</P>
<P>
   So my suggestion would be to simply draw the funds evenly from
your various accounts as needed to meet the mortgage prepayment
schedule. You could begin by taking the actual portfolio yield,
although that probably represents less that 1.5 percent of the
portfolio balance. It doesnt seem to me that there is any
particular imbalance in the portfolio, assuming you agree that you
are in a sufficiently strong financial position to be almost fully
invested in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   One strategy you might employ would be to assess your market
performance at the end of each year, and if you find that the
market performance of the previous year did not support the 4.82
percent withdrawals, you could defer prepayments during the
following year, meaning you would stretching out the mortgage
prepayment schedule, but also meaning that you would not be selling
stock positions into a weak market.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you feel that upon retirement your
portfolio should be more conservative, you could swap your $95,000
position in Investment Company of America for shares in a sister
fund, Income Company of America. The latter is a balanced fund with
its investments about evenly divided between stocks and
fixed-income holdings. Similarly, you could transfer some of the
funds in your second 401(k) to the balanced account, where your
current position represents a token participation in the
fixed-income markets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm a 36-year-old stay-at-home mother of three boys -- aged
six, two and 11 months. My husband is 38 years old and has 12 years
in the U.S. Navy. After 15 years he has the options of receiving a
$30,000 bonus and a pension representing 40 percent of his basic
pay, or of taking a pension representing 50 percent of his base
pay. Right now, our investments total $37,000, with Roth IRAs in
Janus fund and Janus Overseas, and accounts in Neuberger Berman
Guardian, Acorn fund, and savings bonds. We fully fund each of our
Roth IRAs each year and add $100 per month to each of the other
three accounts. I am thinking of replacing the Neuberger fund with
Vanguard Index Value and the savings bonds with Vanguard Total Bond
Market Index. Which option do you suggest for the pension -- taking
the bonus and investing it, or taking the higher pension? If we
were to take the bonus, how should we invest it?
</P>
<P>
   A.M., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. My guess is that the reasoning behind the idea of the bonus
is to supply retiring servicemen with a pool of cash to tide them
over until they establish themselves in a second career. But I
think you would be much better off in the long run if you went for
the higher pension. You dont cite the estimated base pay for your
husband at the time of his retirement, but lets work out an
estimate based on a $40,000 earnings level. If you took the bonus
and a pension of $16,000 a year, you would have to achieve average
investment levels of 13.33 percent to bring in the $4,000 which
would represent the equivalent of the 50 percent pension. If your
husbands base pay is higher, then the level of returns needed to
make the bonus-plus-pension deal match the pension-without-bonus
package would be even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Recent stock market years notwithstanding, I dont think that
expectations of long-term market returns in excess of 13 percent
are reasonable, so I would definitely go for the higher pension.
</P>
<P>
   But I also suggest that you make a change in your savings
pattern to insure that you will be in a position to turn down that
bonus. You will doubtless need some extra cash during that
change-of-careers period, and the time to start saving it is now.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to curtail your monthly contributions to
both mutual funds and to the savings bond program and to put that
$300 a month into a money market fund. In three years, with a
presumption of average returns of 5 percent from the money fund,
you would accumulate $11,609, and with any luck, that should be
sufficient to fund you through the transition. If it is not, you
could at that point liquidate some of your savings bond
accumulation. If the transition turns out to be smooth and requires
little or none of your savings, at that point you could restore the
cash you would have saved to your mutual fund accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I agree that it would be wise to swap the position in
Neuberger Berman Guardian for shares of Vanguard Index Value. Index
Value has outperformed the Neuberger fund consistently in recent
years, and its low expenses seem to me to augur continued better
performance in the large-cap value market segment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 55 and my husband 59; we plan to retire in two years. We
have $137,000 in various bank CDs, $24,000 in six taxable mutual
fund accounts, and IRA and 401(k) accounts with $270,000 in CDs,
$30,000 in a fixed annuity, $25,000 in a Fidelity Advisor Balanced
account, and $31,000 in 10 additional mutual fund accounts. How can
we better diversify our investments so that we can beat inflation?
We will need $24,000 a year from our investments when we retire.
</P>
<P>
   K.K., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. This is one of those tough situations to advise in, since Ive
always assumed that when a person has built an ultra-conservative
portfolio, it hasnt happened by accident. Thus with my estimate
that you have 91.3 percent of your portfolio on the fixed-income
side, I've guessed that you are very risk-averse.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly coming up with the $24,000 will be no problem; the
yields on your CD accounts alone should be sufficient to bring you
that income stream. But your remaining investments are too
conservative to give you a good shot at countering the effects of
inflation in your later years. Your broad array of mutual funds
don't give you much in the way of diversification, since the
positions in the funds which might give you the kind of long-term
growth you need are too small. These are funds such as Fidelity
Growth and Income, Barclay S&AMP;P Midcap Stock and Barclay S&AMP;P 500
funds. My suggestion would be to pare the portfolio down so that
you have about $75,000 in such funds, and the remaining in your
choice of the many balanced or asset allocation funds. This would
still leave you with more than 80 percent of your savings in
fixed-income investments, but it would be a step in the right
direction.

FAT MAN IN A MIDDLE SEAT 
Forty Years of Covering Politics 
By Jack W. Germond 
Random House, 284 pp., $25.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On numerous occasions in his memoirs, covering 40 years on the
political-reporting beat, Jack Germond takes us on an almost Hunter
Thompson-esque journey of caloric and fermented excess.
</P>
<P>
   One 1966 night on the town with a Richard Nixon aide, for
example, consisted of 13 Irish coffees in a cocktail lounge and
beers in an after-hours club. As Germond wistfully notes, today's
generation of clean-living reporters drink white wine instead of
whiskey and eat salads instead of steak.
</P>
<P>
   That's the core point of ``Fat Man in a Middle Seat'': Things
sure have changed in politics. Not only the lifestyles of
journalists but the rules of the game and the relationships between
the media and the pols.
</P>
<P>
   Germond _ a political columnist for The Baltimore Sun and TV
pundit best known as the mildly cantankerous liberal on ``The
McLaughlin Group'' _ has traded toasts with many of the nation's
leading postwar pols. And the book is at its most engaging when he
delivers his personal critiques of those figures.
</P>
<P>
   George Wallace was a political animal whose racism represented
more a campaign tool than heartfelt conviction. ``Clean Gene''
McCarthy, the saintly darling of the left in the 1968 presidential
race, showed an uglier side in private, carping about the press and
even bad-mouthing the loyal students who fueled his insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Germond didn't click personally with Richard
Nixon, who comes across as the kind of tortured soul portrayed in
Oliver Stone's movie ``Nixon.'' The author soured on Jimmy Carter,
eventually coming to view him as fatally weak. (The epiphany comes
in 1979 when Carter, angry at the negative columns Germond is
writing about him, invites him for drinks at the White House and
fails to give the columnist a sufficiently fearsome tongue-lashing.
``If this were Lyndon Johnson, I'd be afraid my barn would be
burning at this very moment,'' he writes.)
</P>
<P>
   Germond portrays Ronald Reagan as a distracted dolt and assails
Clinton for being ``the most selfish and egocentric politician I
have ever seen.'' Germond seems to anoint Bobby Kennedy as his
favorite pol, and saves his greatest disdain for George Bush, whom
he calls ``the most vacuous man to occupy the Oval Office in my
time in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbled throughout ``Fat Man in a Middle Seat'' are clear
examples of how the politics/journalism equation has changed.
Germond recalls, for instance, how he once talked Robert Strauss
out of running for president in the 1980s. That's the kind of
too-cozy relationship between reporter and source that would earn
Germond a tongue-lashing from Brill's Content today. The author
admits he didn't maintain proper ``detachment,'' but brushes the
issue aside by saying, ``I couldn't help but go into the tank for
Strauss; he was too good company.''
</P>
<P>
   In another telling passage, Germond recounts sitting in a hotel
while a woman who had just emerged from a tryst with George Wallace
bragged about it. ``It never occurred to me to report it,'' he
writes. ``These days it could be Page One stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Germond is clearly no devotee of the introspective,
self-flagellating brand of journalism. And it's refreshing to read
a book about the media that doesn't lecture on how to restore
faltering public trust in the Fourth Estate. He even has the
temerity to admit his preference for what ``politial scientists
disparage as horse race journalism, which means putting the
emphasis on winners and losers rather than the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Germond imparts his most serious message in the book's final
pages, warning that political journalism's ``most egregious
weakness'' is the tendency to transform a candidate's minor gaffe
into a major story without ``any sense of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, Germond recalls a 1979 Maine GOP straw poll
that Howard Baker lost to George Bush by 20 votes after delivering
a bad speech. Baker was instantly buried by the press, which
trashed his political skills without asking what Germond deemed to
be the crucial question: ``Why in the world should a public
official of the quality of Howard Baker be eliminated as a
presidential candidate on the basis of this one episode?''
</P>
<P>
   On the plane back to Washington from Maine, Germond sat with a
top Baker adviser who gamely tried to spin the defeat while
``swill(ing) down six Jack Daniels.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers will find that such Germond moralizing is relatively
rare. His encyclopedic recall of the tippling habits of Baker's
aide is much more typical of the breezy style of the book.

`NO FORGIVENESS IN MCAS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The titles of the senior humanities portfolios collected last
week by Eileen Shakespear at Fenway High School were impressive
enough: ``The Chilean Military Coup of 1973,'' ``The Vietnam War's
Effect on Veterans,'' ``The Persecution of Homosexuals During World
War II,'' ``Kurt Vonnegut and the First Amendment,'' and ``What
Made Hitler So Powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Other subjects included the Tuskegee experiment of untreated
syphilis on African-American men, the Milgram experiment on how far
people would follow orders against their personal conscience,
genital mutilation, busing in Boston, Salvador Dali, and Thomas
Jefferson's fathering of a black woman.
</P>
<P>
   Just as interesting were the students who were not finished.
About 15 students were in a computer lab, typing so hard that their
pecking filled the air like jackhammers. Their fingers were
seemingly so loud because their mouths were so quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so amazing is that they are working so hard, but most
of the kids flunk the portfolios the first time around,''
Shakespear said. ``Some of them will cry. They will all feel real
bad. But it shows they care about their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as if on cue, some ninth-grade boys walked down the
hallway. Unlike the quiet focus of the seniors, they walked in a
more sloppy swagger, talking loudly. ``That's how many of them come
to us when they start here,'' Shakespear said. ``I become angry
when I hear that Fenway does better because we get better kids. Our
kids come in like ninth graders everywhere, with hoods over their
heads. A lot of them come without a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The students end up finding a purpose in a way that should make
the state think far more carefully about its myopic mission to
judge students solely on the basis of standardized test scores.
Fenway is a school where scores do not predict success.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty rate of the school is 60 percent. If the MCAS were
required for graduation right now instead of 2003, 56 percent of
Fenway students would fail in English, 85 percent would fail in
math, and 74 percent would fail in science. Taken together, the
categories of ``failing'' and ``needs improvement'' take in 88
percent of Fenway 10th graders in English, 99 percent in math, and
93 percent in science.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Director Larry Myatt walks the halls with an electric step
and infectious pride. The reason is simple. He said, ``Ninety
percent of our students come in here with scores that are failing.
Ninety percent of our kids go on to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Myatt, given the powers of a pilot school, has crafted an
environment where teachers like Shakespear can tap into the
potential of students. Unlike the horrors of larger high schools
where one teacher may have several classes of 25 to 35 students
each, Shakespear has only 45 students, split into two sections,
with a teaching intern and a twice-a-week volunteer who can reduce
her student-to-teacher ratio to as low as 7-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks your heart to keep hearing about teachers with 150
students,'' said Shakespear, a former middle school teacher. ``I
might not be here teaching today if I had that load.''
</P>
<P>
   In technology, Fenway has far more superior access to the
Internet than most Boston public schools. All its classroom
computers are on the Internet, compared with 40 percent for the
city and 66 percent for the state. While the state's ratio of
students per computer is 6.3-to-1 and the Boston system's ratio is
5-to-1, the ratio at the Fenway is 2.2 students per computer.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Myatt has made the rewards for learning
tangible. Few Fenway students score above 1,000 on the SATs, but he
has developed relationships with colleges that search for potential
beyond one-shot tests. Graduates go on to Wheaton, Brandeis, Tufts,
Tuskegee, Hampshire, Suffolk, Bradford, and public institutions in
Massachusetts. Myatt said two graduates have gone on to become
class presidents at Wheaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still struggle,'' Myatt said. ``They still have catching
up to do because they are now with more affluent kids. But they're
on their way. If these kids were to have been judged solely on the
MCAS, they may have never gotten the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   That disturbs Myatt, who was involved in the early discussions
of what would become the Massachusetts Comprehensive System
Assessment. He had hoped it would be a tool to identify problem
schools and districts in order to improve them. Now he says it has
become a tool more for punishing students and blaming parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no forgiveness in MCAS,'' Myatt said. ``There is no
hunger, no thirst, no intellectual gratification you can measure in
these tests. These scores send a message to our kind of students
that `You failed by a long shot.' I fear so many kids will see it
as a such a long shot, they will drop out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that the MCAS can't be useful as an organizing
tool for curriculum. But there are plenty of kids who test well who
can't critically think their way out of a paper bag. The more you
use this as the single instrument to judge our kids, the more kids
you leave to the side. As far as I can see, all the MCAS is doing
is turning into a real estate indicator.''

GETTING INTO TOP SCHOOLS IS EASIER THAN IT SEEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, in addition to their Christmas presents, tens of
thousands of high school seniors will be opening a far less
satisfying seasonal item: rejections or deferrals on their early
applications to college.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news will likely have their parents grousing at holiday
parties about how difficult it must be to get into college.
</P>
<P>
   And it is, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the nation's 2,044 four-year colleges and
universities _ indeed, the majority of those in the US News and
World Report Top 50 _ accept fully half the students who apply.
Many more schools, including some among the Seven Sisters and the
country's top public universities, accept two out of three, or even
three out of four, of their applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The happy little secret of college admissions is that a very
large percentage of students get into one of their top choice
colleges,'' said Richard Zeckhauser, a professor of political
economy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, who studies
college admissions. ``But the colleges won't tell you this, because
it's in their interest to say this is a very competitive process.''
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that schools like Harvard, Brown and Stanford,
all of which accepted just more than 10 percent of applicants last
spring, are tough to get into. But those schools, trendsetters in
so many ways, have come to shape _ and hype _ popular perception of
college admissions, making parents and students think that colleges
are much more choosy than they actually are.
</P>
<P>
   This year promises to heighten the hype. The number of early
applications has gone up sharply, but the percentage of acceptances
has stayed about the same, so a greater number of students will
receive rejection notices or deferrals this month. A deferral
pushes an applicant into the regular pool of candidates who will
not find out if they are accepted until April. And it may also make
it seem like colleges have become that much more selective.
</P>
<P>
   Several indicators, though, offer a reality check.
</P>
<P>
   Consider last spring's acceptance rates at several top schools,
as indicated by the colleges for the annual US News rankings. Smith
College took 56 percent of applicants, Mount Holyoke 64 percent.
The University of Chicago accepted 61 percent of applicants,
Brandeis, 57 percent. Two top ranked public universities, The
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and the University of Wisconsin
at Madison, accepted 59 percent and 73 percent of applicants,
respectively. Carleton College and Macalester College, both top
liberal arts schools, accepted 56 percent of applicants, and
Vanderbilt, the 20th-ranked national university, accepted 59
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's generally written about is how hard it is to get into
these schools, that less than one in four people are accepted, that
all schools cost $120,000. But that's only a small percentage of
the schools,'' said Robert Morse, who compiles the US News
rankings. ``Outside of the Top 10, Top 25 schools, it's rare to
find schools that accept less than 50 percent of students.''
</P>
<P>
   Another measure is the acceptance rate at the 500-odd schools
that offer some kind of early application programs. According to a
survey by the National Association for College Admission
Counseling, about half those schools say they admit between 60 and
79 percent of total applicants, whether they apply early or
regular. About 20 percent admitted 80 percent or more. Less than 5
percent admitted less than 20 percent of applicants.
</P>
<P>
   And in April of each year, at the end of the admissions cycle,
executive director Joyce Smith points out, the association
publishes a list of 300 to 400 schools that are still willing to
consider applications. The Ivies aren't on the list, but some
renowned schools are: Lesley and Simmons colleges, Fordham
University, the flagship campus of Pennsylvania State University,
Dickinson College, and Temple University.
</P>
<P>
   High school guidance counselors say it's rare that they have to
resort to using that list. But that's only because most of their
students get into their top choice schools.
</P>
<P>
   Milton High School, for example, each year surveys how many of
their seniors get into their first or second choice school. That
rate has held steady at about 80 percent for several years. While
other high schools say they don't do similar checks, they believe
the rates are about the same.
</P>
<P>
   The message guidance counselors want to convey? Plan ahead, but
relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, we live through this whole thing with early
decision, then we live through the wait list, but overall it works
out,'' said Vincent D'Antona, director of guidance and counseling
for the Arlington schools. ``We hype this college stuff, but in the
end, they're all going to be OK. Most are going to get their first
choice or maybe their second choice, and in a rare few, it might be
their third.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is the perception one of a process so exclusive?
</P>
<P>
   Colleges want to look as selective as possible so they can
ultimately attract a better and better pool of students.
</P>
<P>
   Admissions officers privately concede that some schools will try
to encourage applications, even from students they know don't meet
their standards, so they can reject more students, and look more
choosy. Less scrupulous schools may count half-completed
applications, or students who had the College Board send SAT scores
but did not apply, as requests for admission, Zeckhauser said, so
they can say they rejected more students.
</P>
<P>
   The more selective the colleges are, the more appealing they
become. They start to attract the attention of students with better
SAT scores and grades, which sends their rankings, and desirability
even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Admissions specialists argue that this is the principal reason
so many colleges now use the common application, which allows
students to use the same form to apply to dozens of schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scarcity is where it's at,'' said Bill Mayher, a former
guidance counselor at top private schools outside New York and
Boston, and the author of ``The College Admissions Mystique.''
``Improving the product isn't going to bring in more customers,
selectivity does. The way kids perceive it, if a college is hard to
get into, it's good. If it's less hard to get into, it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy feeds the frenzy: high schools say that seniors are
applying to 10 or 12 schools now, up from four or five just five
years ago. More applications mean more rejections and thus the
perception of greater selectivity.
</P>
<P>
   Mayher says early applications have made the whole cycle even
more vicious: ``The letters come out in the high point of American
communication, which is the preholiday cocktail party, office
party. When the parental rumor mill is operating full-tilt,
everybody is talking about which first rate students have been
deferred. Stoking those fires has been an incredibly successful
move for colleges, because they don't even get caught marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   But selectivity is also in the interest of students.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always want to be part of a group they can't get
into,'' Zeckhauser said. ``Can you imagine if the college wrote to
every kid saying, `Congratulations, you got in, do you realize that
70 percent of applicants got in?' Instead, the president welcomes
them opening day, saying `You're very lucky to be here, we had an
incredibly strong pool,` and everyone looks around and feels
great.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, college and high school admissions advisers say,
is to get students to focus on what school is best for them, not
simply the best school.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to go to elite schools, even if they're not
elite kids,'' said Jim O'Loughlin, a guidance counselor at
Groton-Dunstable (Mass.) Regional High School. ``Those are the
schools the kids figure they have to go to.''

QUARTERBACK BISHOP MAY CALL AN OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Think of your own child. You see wonderful
potential. You have big, elaborate plans for him or her. You want
him or her to be a doctor or a CEO of a Fortune 500 company, but
then you find out he or she really wants to do something completely
different. You're exasperated. Then, after the initial shock,
you're happy.
</P>
<P>
   Well Patriots fans, such might be the case with your favorite
son, Michael Bishop, perhaps the most celebrated third-string
quarterback since Doug Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   You have big plans for Bishop as a quarterback in the NFL, but
your collective hearts may be broken. ``My first love is
baseball,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball?
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. This is a the kid who some believe should replace
Drew Bledsoe for the final two games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is my No. 1 sport,'' Bishop said. ``A lot of people
didn't know that. I think I'm a better baseball player than I am a
football player. You're always better at your first love.''
</P>
<P>
   This might be good news for the Cleveland Indians, who drafted
him. Bishop last played baseball at Blinn Jr. College, a
baseball/football factory in southern Texas. One said, ``Good
tools. Good speed. He has a gun for an arm, but he's raw. He'll
have trouble hitting the curveball at different levels, but he's a
determined, hard worker who could make himself into a player.''
Bishop is a third baseman, who would probably be moved to the
outfield to take advantage of his speed.
</P>
<P>
   Could he be a good player?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is given,'' said Bishop. ``You have to work for it.
You can't promise anything. I still have to work hard at what I
have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some thought Bishop should have been utilized this season to
take advantage of his athleticism. But Pete Carroll and his
offensive coaches thought Bishop should learn to play quarterback
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have caught the ball or run the ball or . . . I have a
good-enough arm to get the ball to the receivers,'' Bishop said.
``I would have been glad to do whatever they wanted me to do to get
on the field. They wanted me to learn to be the best quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Patriots brass constantly mentions NFL Europe,
which has become a steppingstone for many NFL quarterbacks,
including St. Louis's Kurt Warner, Washington's Brad Johnson, and
Seattle's Jon Kitna.
</P>
<P>
   When Bishop speaks to Patriots' vice president of player
personnel Bobby Grier at the end of the season, he will likely hear
that Grier has an offer for him to play for the Frankfurt Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't changed my mind about it,'' said Bishop. ``I've been
asked about Europe since the season was halfway over. I just want
to concentrate on these two wins and then go home to Texas and do
some thinking. Even if I did go to Europe and play well for 10
games, I'd be in the same position I am now. It's a no-win
situation. I don't want to fight battles that I have no chance of
winning. I just want to stay here, lift weights, run.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that the exposure in Europe might spark interest from
another team, Bishop said, ``That's a good point, but if that
doesn't happen, and I'm in the same situation, I don't want to go
there and get on top of my game and then come back and have to
watch everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is a huge fan of Bishop's, but he hasn't found the
proper time to fit him into the game. Carroll envisioned the
Patriots' offense being so powerful that he would be able to play
Bishop late in games, but it hasn't turned out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the way this guy plays football,'' said Carroll. ``I've
never seen a guy with such a fire on the field. I am very strong
about this, I have no reservation he can play in this league. From
what I've seen he can be a factor. I've based that on seeing some
of the other young guys who have come into the league this year and
seeing them on the field. I look for us to get in a position where
he can play. If he had to play, I wouldn't hesitate in putting him
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, a seventh-round pick from Kansas State, was also the
runner-up for the Heisman Trophy. Starting all 25 games at Kansas
State, he finished with a 22-3 record and 36 touchdown passes in
two seasons. He rushed for 748 yards on 177 carries with 14
touchdowns and threw for 2,844 yards in his senior season. He was
24-0 at Blinn and won two NJCAA titles.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, according to team sources, hasn't been the most studious
of players, spending little time going over film and the playbook.
</P>
<P>
   He has a basic understanding of the offense so that if he had to
play, the Patriots would simplify the offense to its base level
(which is not such a bad idea for Bledsoe), and Bishop would also
add his freelancing ability to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everything they've wanted me to learn,'' he said. ``I
can run the exact same plays as Drew and John (Friesz) if I had the
chance. I'm always doing all I can. I feel like I put myself in a
situation where my teammates have confidence in me. I learned a lot
by watching. Not being able to play has been a setback. I learned
some good things and some bad things. I've just tried to keep
myself focussed to be the best athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing he will not do is beg for playing time. ``I'm not
going to put myself in the situation where I'm going to ask them to
play,'' Bishop said. ``If they want me to go out and help the team,
I'll do the best I can. But otherwise I'll just sit back and learn
from Drew. I'm not going to beg to get into a game. If you prepare
yourself well, you know what's going on and you have confidence,
you can get the job done. With me I know I'll come in and put
points on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite having a completely different style than Bledsoe, Bishop
said he's learned from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just learned from hearing some of the things he's said,''
said Bishop. ``He's struggled this year, but he's still one of the
best in the league. He's always talking about what he's doing wrong
or what he's doing right, and if you listen hard enough, you can
begin to understand some things.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said that while Bishop's athleticism could carry him
through a game, his inexperience is cause for reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand the lack of time he's had at playing
our system at our level,'' said Carroll. ``He hasn't had that. I
think he's a regular first-year guy. He thinks he can do anything.
No challenge is too much for him. He has a tremendous competitive
attitude, but it doesn't mean he's ready to run the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead, maybe he's ready to run the bases.

`CRADLE WILL ROCK' BRINGS THE '30S VIVIDLY TO THE SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
CRADLE WILL ROCK 
Written and directed by: Tim Robbins 
Starring: Hank Azaria, Bob Balaban, Ruben Blades, Joan Cusack, John
Cusack, Cary Elwes, Philip Baker Hall, Cherry Jones, Angus
MacFadyen, Bill Murray, Vanessa Redgrave, Susan Sarandon, Jamey
  Sheridan, John Turturro,  Emily Watson 
Running time: 133 minutes 
Rated: R (some language and sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cradle Will Rock'' is film's most gratifying piece of time
travel since ``Shakespeare in Love.'' It's not just that Tim
Robbins so richly evokes the most invigorating decade of the
American century _ the 1930s _ when art, passion, and politics came
together in populist ways that continue to energize artistic
endeavor today. Robbins doesn't just throw everything he knows into
``Cradle Will Rock.'' He throws everything he is into it. It isn't
perfect, but there isn't a film this year that's more alive with
heart, richness, and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of what Robbins calls a mostly true story is the
musical Marc Blitzstein wrote for the Federal Theater in 1936.
``The Cradle Will Rock'' (why Robbins dropped the article I don't
know), aflame with idealism, depicted steelworkers fighting back
against owners downsizing them into the Depression before the word
downsizing was invented. Today, of course, the steel mills mostly
have been moved to other countries. Even in its own time, ``The
Cradle Will Rock'' probably would have joined most earnest agitprop
in being quickly forgotten. But it got a great boost from its
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   When Red-baiting right-wing politicians succeeded in locking the
troupe out of its theater on opening night, the company, with its
ranks swelled by a sympathetic public, marched 21 blocks uptown to
another theater. Forbidden by their own union from appearing
onstage, the actors performed from their seats and other places in
the auditorium while Blitzstein, who was not a member of the
musicians union, accompanied from an onstage piano. The result was
an electrifying evening of musical theater history. Using the event
as his centerpiece, Robbins fashions a rousing evocation of a
cultural landscape that much American art can still call home.
</P>
<P>
   Although the film is not without some broad political
cartooning, Robbins adroitly and virtuosically echoes both the
structure of Blitzstein's folk opera and another famous collision
of a few years prior. In 1932, Nelson Rockefeller commissioned
Mexican artist Diego Rivera to paint a mural in the then new
Rockefeller Center lobby, only to have it destroyed when Rivera
insisted on featuring in it both Lenin and a stream of syphilis
bacteria soaring out over the heads of capitalists. In a sense,
this film is Robbins's own version of that mural. It's also a
provocative continuation, metaphorically speaking, of that march
through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Blades is an enlivening presence as the mischievous
Rivera. John Cusack transcends caricature to actually arrive at
moments of sympathy as Rockefeller, who finds that his appreciation
of art has its limits. Cusack's Rockefeller is the kind of guy who
can dance in Rivera's studio with a reluctant Frieda Kahlo and two
nude models, yet still utterly lack the capacity to appreciate the
rich irony in Rivera's mural sitting above the altar in one of the
great temples of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But the main event is the Federal Theater episode, and Robbins
fleshes it out with delicious theatricality, For the most part, it
is wonderfully realized by a cast that somehow refrains from
smacking its lips over the juicy parts Robbins has written for
them. It's essential to put a believable Orson Welles on screen and
Angus MacFadyen flails and billows and bellows in an unwavering
state of high dudgeon as the then boy-genius, who saw no conflict
between his self-appointed role as proletarian spokesman and
recipient of liquor-laced luncheons at the 21 Club, that
speakeasy-turned-posh-eatery. Cary Elwes provides droll
counterpoint as his snooty and mismatched colleague, John Houseman.
We can believe that however ill-suited they may have been, they
were amazingly productive.
</P>
<P>
   Working the up-market end of Robbins's canvas are Vanessa
Redgrave, as a dithery but well-intentioned patron of the arts,
Philip Baker Hall as her steel magnate husband who at least doesn't
pretend to be a deep soul, and Susan Sarandon, as Mussolini's
smooth ex-mistress and current emissary, offering the plutocrat a
da Vinci as a bribe to keep exporting steel to Il Duce. In
deliberate and effective contrast that leaves no shred of doubt
about the dialectic Robbins is after, John Turturro shines as a
poor but principled actor who turns his back on the security
offered by members of his family because he won't endorse their
tolerance of fascism. Hank Azaria is another plus as Blitzstein,
haunted by visions of his big influence, Bertolt Brecht.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Watson burns with pale fire, too, as unemployed Olive
Stanton, who played the key role of a prostitute in the musical,
then disappeared from view. With her expressive button face
dominated by eyes that dare not be anything but pragmatic as she
contemplates the source of her next meal and a plan for getting
through the night, Watson's performance effortlessly hits the right
note of Depression-era poignancy that would never dream of
descending to self-pity. Watson is the soul of the movie. The
others talk a lot about the masses and the bread stolen from the
mouths of workers. When Watson's blue eyes go dead, we know she's
the one who has actually gone hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Cusack and Bill Murray make emotional poverty piercingly
poignant as pinched, damaged people who give more comfort to the
enemies of the Federal Theater than to each other.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to pick a favorite performance, it would be that of
Cherry Jones, as that indefatigable warrior, Hallie Flanagan, who
not only convinces as the rock upon which the theater is built, but
as the angel of theater itself. Long after the Federal Theater and
its comrade in arms, The Group Theater, dissolved, they continued
to catalyze the best in taboo-shattering American theater, with a
spirit of insurrection built into its ethos.
</P>
<P>
   Working the other side of the street, Sarandon is scarcely less
wonderful as Mussolini's press agent, drumming up good will and a
steel deal. Not that ``Cradle Will Rock'' is without a few missteps
in its rush to line up its dialectics. I wish, for instance, that
more care had been taken in the casting of William Randolph Hearst,
who just four years later was to clash famously with Welles over
``Citizen Kane.'' But Robbins and ``Cradle Will Rock'' are on the
side of the angels here, and their shortfall is the result of
overreaching ambition. Although downsizing and homelessness have
hardly vanished, ``Cradle Will Rock'' is virtually alone in
reigniting the activist torch as grandly as it does and recapturing
the sizzle of the '30s.

AT 89, HE HAS DONE IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you tried to figure out which New Englanders got the most
fun, adventure, and zest out of the century nearing its end, you'd
be hard pressed to do better than settle upon Bradford Washburn and
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he sweet-talked the former Barbara Polk into a life
of mountain-climbing and exploration to spice up the routine of
museum work, the wiry 89-year-old and his spouse have been up and
down more often than Jack and Jill.
</P>
<P>
   Explorer, cartographer, climber, and photographer of the
planet's wildest and most remote places, Washburn's life unrolled
like an endless script of an adventure novel from the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   Mt. Everest, Mt. McKinley, and the Grand Canyon have all fallen
under his eye, lens, and mapmaker's pencil. And the fruits of a
remarkable life are gathered in an exhibition at Boston
University's Department of Special Collections in the Mugar Library
off Commonwealth Avenue. There's a picture of his father, Henry,
dean of the Episcopal Theological School, riding a white horse
along an unpaved Brattle Street in Cambridge in 1910, the year
Bradford was born.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of the family letters and photographs, astonishing
for their freshness and cheerful affection, detail a childhood that
seems scripted for a simpler, more idyllic era. When Brad became
captain of the Groton School baseball team, father weighed in with
a manly letter of congratulations, leavened with Victorian-era
advice useful to this day:
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch the way your men play . . . be particularly careful to
find out which boys are the best heads, that is the boys who are
calmest and make the quickest and best decisions as to what plays
to make, and then find out where they play the best. And be just as
strict with yourself as you are with the others.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a crude but serviceable childhood map of Squam Lake in
New Hampshire, with colored shading indicating best spots for
pickerel and bass fishing. A typed manuscript from the boy
naturalist later made it into print in ``The Churchman'' magazine.
Brad sternly admonishes piscators: ``I have fished to eat, it is
not good to fish for fun and after you have a great many fish to
throw them away or give them to the cat. God never intended them to
be thrown away, he expects them to swim around and chase their
tails.''
</P>
<P>
   At 17 he climbed Mt. Blanc, Western Europe's tallest peak, and
wrote about it. In Alaska, he climbed down a tricky crevasse at the
end of a 100-foot rope to rescue three fallen sled dogs, a perilous
business that qualifies him as dog lover of the century.
</P>
<P>
   His honeymoon with Barbara included ``bringing along eight
college kids,'' says Tom Winship, the retired Boston Globe editor
who photographed the couple atop Alaska's Mt. Bertha in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I recall,'' Washburn deadpanned the night of his BU exhibit
opening, ``I set the camera up, handed it to Tom, and told him just
to push the button.'' Mt. Bertha was named for a famed local
prostitute, a landmark in her own way, Washburn chortled, a fact he
learned only later.
</P>
<P>
   Winship said the 1940 party included a European ski instructor
``who turned out to be a spy; the SOB had been a leader of Nazi
youth in Salzburg. He was arrested after we got back from the two
months on the glacier.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit displays a cautionary letter from Gilbert Grosvenor,
the gray eminence of the National Georgraphic Society, and warns of
an upcoming Alaska trek when Brad was, at age 24, appointed chief:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yours is the first expedition we have trusted to a man as
young as yourself . . . The ascent of previously unscaled mountains
is always attended with considerable uncertainty and peril . . .
The fact that you have, in your few years of active work, made a
really remarkable record of achievement in Europe, the United
States, and Alaska, which is good evidence of your ability to
prepare beforehand, might very naturally lead you to be a little
over-confident and to take risks in this summer's expedition that
an older man might not venture to take.''
</P>
<P>
   But it all ended well, as did most of his jaunts, including
hanging out of a plane over Mt. Everest with a camera.
</P>
<P>
   Photos of Washburn's astonishing landscapes are in a concurrent
exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Do not count Brad Washburn among those who look back with more
fondness than they contemplate the road ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you pass 80, one must spend every single minute looking
ahead,'' he said in a speech in Switzerland five years ago. ``We
are living today in an ever-more-thrilling world.'' Between
adventures, he led the Museum of Science to ``keep the public,
young and old alike, abreast of this marvelous world of change _ to
open eyes, to broaden horizons, to stimulate the curiosity and
creativity of our citizenry.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Dr. Howard Gotlieb, who heads BU's Special Collections,
``Brad has done everything, been everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad way to pass the century.

THE MEDICAID ISSUE: SAME PLAN, DIFFERENT SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he surveyed the health care industry six years
ago, and considered ways to improve it, President Clinton proposed
eliminating Medicaid, the federal-state insurance plan for the poor
and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   It is a huge program, covering 35 million people and one of
every three births. But the group that designed Clinton's health
plan viewed Medicaid as deeply flawed: Its rules are confusing, and
many eligible people do not enroll.
</P>
<P>
   It also segregates the poor in their own health system, leading
to lower quality care.
</P>
<P>
   Now, years after the president's Medicaid plan died, along with
his health-care overhaul, a big-name Democrat is building a
presidential campaign around on a similar idea.
</P>
<P>
   But in a twist, the new proposal comes from former Senator Bill
Bradley. And its chief critic is a man who once backed Clinton's
idea, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, in fact, has been one of the most serious points of
contention between the two candidates. Gore says Bradley's approach
could disrupt care for the needy; Bradley says Gore is unfairly
twisting his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 7 million disabled Americans who rely on Medicaid,
many of them to get out of bed each morning,'' Gore said to Bradley
in a testy exchange last week on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``Half
of the people with AIDS, and two-thirds of all the seniors in
nursing homes, rely on Medicaid. He eliminates it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says Gore has distorted his notion. ``There's an absence
of telling the whole story,'' he said on the program.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley aides call Gore hypocritical for attacking a plan the
vice president once supported, and that claim resonates with some
Medicaid specialists. ``There are details one can worry about, but
it seems peculiar to make the issue one of principle, since the
principle was part of the Clinton/Gore national health reform,''
said Paul Offner, a Georgetown University professor who ran the
Medicaid programs for Ohio and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that the Gore campaign is criticizing
Bradley, because Bradley's plan similar to what he originally
wanted to do years ago,'' John Holahan, a health policy specialist
at the Urban Institute, said of Gore. Holahan says either plan
could be made to work.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicaid debate is one piece of a broader discussion of
health care that has become central to the Democratic primary
campaign. In general, Bradley would spend far more money than Gore
_ as much as $650 billion over 10 years _ in an attempt to move
toward covering all 44.3 million Americans who have no insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would spend $264 billion on a plan that focuses most
intensely on serving the poor and near-poor. He claims to cover as
many as 15 million uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As in Clinton's 1994 proposal, Bradley would eliminate Medicaid
and give beneficiaries money to buy insurance in the private
market. He would build on the existing Federal Employees Health
Benefits Program, which provides insurance to federal employees,
using it to enroll Medicaid beneficiaries and educate them on their
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bradley would give money to the many poor and
near-poor people who do not qualify for Medicaid because they have
no children or do not meet other guidelines. ``Medicaid is supposed
to cover people who are poor, but 40 percent of the people who are
in poverty in this country do not have any health insurance,
none,'' Bradley said recently. ``Medicaid doesn't cover them. Under
our proposal, they would have health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore says that he is open to replacing Medicaid with something
better, but that Bradley's plan falls short. He has three major
criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   First, Gore says, Bradley offers beneficiaries too little money
to buy insurance, forcing them to pay part of their premiums from
their own pockets. Many would refuse, Gore says, so Bradley would
actually take insurance away from many poor people who currently
have it.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would give $1,800 on average to each adult to buy
insurance. That is enough to buy coverage from only 12 of the 300
private plans that offer insurance through the federal employees'
program, said Kenneth Thorpe, a professor of health policy at Emory
University in Atlanta, who is not aligned with either campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Those 12 plans cover only 5 percent of people in the federal
program, and none operates in Washington, Los Angeles, New York, or
anywhere in New England. If they moved into those regions, Thorpe
said, they would have to raise their premiums to adjust for higher
costs in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Bradley plan, there's a high likelihood and almost
certainty that a Medicaid beneficiary will have to pay toward the
premium of a new health plan,'' said Thorpe, who was a senior
Clinton administration health official when the president offered
his own plan.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's camp says that many states are already moving
their Medicaid beneficiaries into private managed care plans _ and
for less than Bradley's $1,800 per adult. Tennessee pays for $1,189
a year, for example, and California pays $993.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's second criticism is that private plans offer fewer
benefits than does Medicaid, which covers transportation to a
doctor's office and requires low or no copayments for medication
and doctors' visits. Those features are designed to make sure that
low-income people stay in the program.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1994 plan, Clinton would have provided those services as
free add-ons once Medicaid beneficiaries joined private plans. But
Gore says Bradley would not provide them, and that eligible people
would leave the program rather than pay for those services out of
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Higgins, an adviser to the Bradley campaign, said health
plans would be forced to require these extra services if they
wanted to serve Medicaid beneficiaries, and that competition among
the plans would keep the costs down. ``The vice president talks
about the Bradley proposal as if it is an experiment,'' Higgins
said. ``But under the Clinton-Gore administration, at least 20
states have received waivers to convert their Medicaid programs to
do just this.''
</P>
<P>
   The third Gore criticism involves Medicaid payments to nursing
homes. After removing all state responsibility for Medicaid,
Bradley would hand states full responsibility for paying for
low-income people to stay in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said the shared federal-state responsibility today leads
to poor service, but Gore's side says that under law, the federal
government could not enforce its quality standards if it did not
fund nursing homes. The result would be a deterioration of service
at nursing homes, they say.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore would leave Medicaid intact and make 1
million additional children eligible for it and for a related
federal-state program. Most important, he would tell parents that
if their children are eligible for either health program, then the
parents are, as well. Gore believes this will he a powerful
incentive for parents to contact state authorities and enroll their
families.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley says Gore's approach errs in keeping Medicaid's
burdensome administrative apparatus in place. Moreover, he says
Gore would not cover adults without children or families who
narrowly miss Medicaid income cutoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would Gore eliminate ``the stigmatization that comes from
Medicaid,'' Bradley said recently in a comment that echoed the
conclusion of Hillary Rodham Clinton's 1993 task force.
</P>
<P>
   Several independent specialists say that in many ways, the
debate is off the point. Both the Gore and Bradley plans could be
made to cover millions of additional people.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicaid system is able to handle the new people that Gore
would enroll, they say. And at the right price, every low-income
American could find private insurance, as Bradley wants. The big
question is whether each candidate can cover the additional people
he claims for the price he has set, and whether he would add more
money to his plan if he fell short of his coverage goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could screw it up,'' Holahan said of the Bradley plan.
``But good people thinking through it carefully could make it
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that one approach is better. They're different
judgments about politics,'' Offner said. After watching Clinton's
1994 proposal collapse, ``Gore is saying the incremental approach
works best, while Bradley says we can make big steps.''

GODSMACK'S MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aerosmith is headed out of town _ and so is Phish and the J.
Geils Band, the other area giants that have played many New Year's
Eve shows around town. That leaves newly crowned stars Godsmack to
fill the local concert void with ``Smackfest 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you heard it right _ ``Smackfest 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an ambitious, hard-rock event coming to the unlikely
setting of Boston's Bayside Exposition Center, which more typically
has car shows and flower shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed some room, and we're going to try to make it as much
of a festival atmosphere as possible,'' Godsmack's Sully Erna says
of his band's New Year's Eve bash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have vendors in the crowd, psychic readers, and
a Harley-Davidson exhibition _ stuff like that. And we'll have two
stages. We're hoping between 7,000 and 10,000 people show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Godsmack will perform late (``we have a special surprise at
midnight,'' says Erna), capping a high-decibel, sonic slugfest that
includes Staind, Tree, and Reveille. And if all goes well, then
``maybe every year we'll have a Smackfest. I don't see why not.''
</P>
<P>
   Erna and his mates are an ambitious bunch _ and their ambition
has been rewarded this year. The band's self-titled album sold 2
million copies _ the most for any Boston act this year. Its twin
radio hits, ``Whatever'' (core verse: ``I'm doing the best that I
can _ now go away!'') and ``Keep Away,'' have made the band this
year's most-played group on active-rock radio stations in the
country, according to trade magazine Radio &AMP; Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's awesome considering that Metallica is mandatory on
every rock station,'' says Erna, whose group likewise beat out Limp
Bizkit and Rage Against the Machine for airplay.
</P>
<P>
   Godsmack also was on the summer Ozzfest tour and had a major
coming-out show at Woodstock '99, where its intense, hammer-down
set ranked among the best of that crazy weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great year. We've grown at a really good pace,''
Erna says from Birmingham, England, where Godsmack is finishing a
European tour with Black Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of good times, we've been seeing all different
kinds of countries, the album's been selling well, and we put out
three videos. We're building our fan base every day. It's just been
an amazing year. In one sense it's a surprise, but in the other
sense, we're very glad that we're being rewarded for all the hard
work we're doing on the road. We are definitely pounding away out
here, and everyone is just super-fried at this point. This is our
14th month in a row that we've been out and we're just tired and
want to go home and rest and recharge our batteries. But at the
same time, at least while we're going through this kind of work and
exhausting ourselves, it's paying off.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the European tour with Sabbath, Godsmack, which first won
fame by being played on local station WAAF-FM (107.3), did its own
autumn headlining tour of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had such a high demand for it that we built a stage and
added crew members and we had lights and riggers and sound
technicians and all sorts of people working for us,'' says Erna.
``We had two 18-wheelers and two tour buses and we took the show on
the road. We nearly sold out everywhere we played and everyone did
a really good job. But it was hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has kept plowing ahead _ and Erna hasn't lost his
voice, a rarity for a hard-rock belter.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, it just hangs in there with me,'' he says
of his instrument. ``I don't really have that much of a problem
with losing my voice. Sometimes I get tired, but a lot of that is
self-induced pain, because I drink too much the night before. All
in all, I've had really good luck with my voice and I don't know
what to attribute that to. I wasn't ever trained, or anything like
that. Whatever I'm doing, I'm doing fairly right.''
</P>
<P>
   He has suffered, however, through a bout of insomnia, which
struck him on several recent nights of the European tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because my body didn't get used to Europe time
and I am still on Eastern time,'' says Erna, whose band has been to
Europe twice this year, but will take next month off and then start
a new album in February. ``It's also because I'm anxious to get
home and I have so many things to do for Christmas, it just keeps
my mind running at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs of home were noticed in recent gigs in the German cities
of Munich and Stuttgart, where fans held aloft WAAF shirts for the
band to see. ``I thought: Either someone is here on vacation or
they've been doing their homework,'' says Erna.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how Godsmack was treated by the headlining Black
Sabbath, Erna replies, ``They're pranksters! When we did the show
in Munich, it was in this old warehouse building, and above the
left-hand side of the stage is this catwalk where you walk over the
crowd. So if you open the dressing room doors, you can look over
the catwalk and down below, where they are serving beers. Me and
Robbie (Merrill, a Godsmack bandmate) are standing out there,
leaning against the railing, and right below us were three or four
girls cracking beers for everybody. Suddenly, Ozzy and Tony
(Osbourne and Iommi, respectively, of Sabbath) come flying out of
the room and Ozzy throws down two stink bombs and runs back into
their room, so we were blamed for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that was my Ozzy story for the tour. And the funny thing
is, when we first met his son Jack at the Ozzfest, we met him the
same way. He came around the corner in a golf cart and threw a
stink bomb at everyone. Now I know where he gets his personality
from! But, really, they're funny guys. They're just having a good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   One final note about the Smackfest: It will be taped as part of
a future home video. ``We have been shooting since the Ozzfest,''
says Erna. ``So we have a lot of pretty funny footage. And
Smackfest will be the climax of the year. We will definitely get it
on film.''

E-MERCHANT SELLS THE HOPE OF SMARTER KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For late 1999, the advertising formula for e-commerce retailers
has been pretty straightforward: Raise a bunch of money, then throw
most of it at a big television ad campaign that drives customers to
the retailer's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   SmarterKids.com Inc. employs a different kind of marketing
strategy, one that relies on everything from plugs on McDonald's
lunch tray liners to e-mail solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, SmarterKids.com sells toys on line. A rival is
eToys Inc., which has spent an estimated $40 million on ads over
the holidays, as it aims to become the top on-line toy store.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when education reform is a hot issue, SmarterKids.com
looks to differentiate itself from the competition by targeting
educational toys.
</P>
<P>
   At its Web site, parents can fill out questionnaires about their
children, entering age, personality traits, and scores from such
standardized exams as the MCAS in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   After processing this information, a program on the Web site
presents users with a list of toys, games, and educational products
that is intended to meet the individual needs of the child.
</P>
<P>
   This capacity makes SmarterKids.com's Web site the equivalent of
``a smart sales clerk,'' says chief executive David Blohm from the
company's Needham, Mass. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet toy stores are mere ``catalogs on line,'' he
said. But SmarterKids.com ``takes e-commerce to the next level,''
Blohm said.
</P>
<P>
   When parents make repeat visits to SmarterKids.com, its
storefront software takes into account past purchases and what
parents have told it about their children. In other words,
different parents see a different mix of products when they visit
the site.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to inspire customer loyalty by ``creating a private
store for every child,'' Blohm says.
</P>
<P>
   On-line toy stores have been put to the test this holiday
season. In some cases, big television ad campaigns have driven more
traffic to some of these Web sites than they can handle. One site
that's struggling belongs to Toys ``R'' Us Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because it has done far less television advertising,
SmarterKids.com can make the claim that it's had no big problems
with site crashes and bungled orders.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings groups have given high marks to SmarterKids.com's site,
but investors remain wary. In its first day of public trading last
month on Nasdaq, SmarterKids.com stock traded at 14. Thursday its
shares closed at 8.
</P>
<P>
   EToys has seen an even more dramatic swing. In three months, its
stock has fallen from 80 to just over 30. Perhaps investors fear
that a post-holiday shakeout will inflict heavy casualties on the
crowded on-line toy retail category.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge ahead for SmarterKids.com: It outsources its
warehouse operations and may soon outgrow its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht &AMP; Quist LLC, the lead manager of the initial public
offering for SmarterKids.com, projects fourth-quarter sales of $4.3
million and next year's sales at $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   SmarterKids.com may need fewer television ads because it refuses
to sell television-hyped toys such as Pokemon and Furby.
</P>
<P>
   Many on-line toy merchants have been devoting 75 percent of
their marketing budgets to television ads, said Al Noyes, a
SmarterKids.com executive. His company, in contrast, is spending
only about a quarter of its marketing dollars on television.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at working mothers and created by the Wenham ad agency
Mullen, a SmarterKids.com television ad campaign has been airing
for the past few weeks. The ads show children at play. ``Open
minds, open worlds'' is part of the message.
</P>
<P>
   SmarterKids.com declines to disclose how much it spends on
marketing, but a chunk of its money goes to buying customer lists
from other Web sites, such as Coolsavings.com, which promises
consumers all sorts of discount coupons and rebates in return for
some personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Once in possession of one of these lists, SmarterKids.com
behaves like a company sending out a mass mailing. But instead of
snail mail, SmarterKids.com uses e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Potential savings may be enormous. It costs about 70 cents for a
direct marketer to send out a piece of mail, Blohm says. An e-mail
can cost less than a dime, and consumers tend to respond to e-mail
faster than other direct marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to reach a broader audience, SmarterKids.com recently
paid McDonald's Corp. to print some SmarterKids.com literature on
the fast-food company's tray liners. The liner copy makes a claim
that SmarterKids.com can help turn children into better readers.
</P>
<P>
   Another marketing effort has SmarterKids.com operating boutiques
for so-called content Web sites, such as LightSpan.com, a sort of
on-line community of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   While such boutiques boost revenues, another goal is to raise
the visibility of SmarterKids.com with educators. The hope is that
when parents ask a teacher how to help their child improve in
school, one piece of advice might be: ``Check out
SmarterKids.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Such initiatives are aimed at customer acquisition, Blohm says,
while radio and television advertising will mostly be reserved for
building the SmarterKids.com brand.
</P>
<P>
   Says Blohm, ``TV can only be part of an overall strategy.''

SPACE SPOOF HITS ITS TARGET 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
GALAXY QUEST 
Directed by: Dean Parisot 
Screenplay by: David Howard, Robert Gordon 
Starring: Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub,
Sam Rockwell, Daryl Mitchell, Enrico Colantoni, Robin Sachs,
Patrick Breen, Missi Pyle, Jed Rees, Justin Long 
Running time: 102 minutes 
Rated: PG (some action violence, mild language and sensuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' isn't the first film to goof on ``Star Trek,''
but it may be the first to include a role for Trekkies. That's part
of what makes it a clever, affectionate, and entertaining holiday
snack for sci-fi fans. Falling somewhere between slick and cheesy,
it wrings levity from a mischievous concept _ TV stars of a
canceled series spacejacked by naive aliens in need of protection.
They think the actors are real space heroes. The stars, meanwhile,
are stars no longer. The series was canceled 20 years ago. They
grumpily appear in costume at conventions of die-hard fans called
Questarians, but only so they can pay their bills by signing
autographs at $15 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   It won't do to push the correspondences too far, but there's
something of William Shatner's Kirk in Tim Allen's Commander
Taggart. Alan Rickman's Dr. Lazarus looks a little like a Klingon,
but he's obviously the Spock figure. And Sigourney Weaver's
Lieutenant Tawny Madison is at the opposite end of the spectrum
from her Ripley character in ``Alien.'' Much is made of her
abundant cleavage, but the space bimbo stuff is offset by the fact
that the actress she's playing, Gwen DeMarco, is the most sensitive
and perceptive among the group. Rickman gets the most mileage out
of their communal gloom as a Shakespearean actor steeped in
melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   The good aliens are amusingly conceived too. Looking like
tutti-frutti octopuses, they're able to alter their appearance to
seem sort of human in a stoned way. They suggest cousins of Brent
Spiner's Data on helium, as they blissfully wait for the heroics to
start once they've beamed the actors aboard the real spaceship they
modeled on the bare-bones sets they saw on reruns they picked up in
space. Enrico Colantoni, the photog of ``Just Shoot Me,'' is
sweetly goofy as the trusting leader of the dwindling race known as
the Thermians. He's ably abetted by Missi Pyle's intergalactic
Betty Boop, who falls for Tony Shalhoub's faux engineer.
</P>
<P>
   The bad guys, led by Robin Sachs, suggest a gang of angry and
heavily armed lobsters. The action, especially on a sandy planet,
has the primitive feel of vintage TV. The special effects are good
enough, and the creatures include one original _ a monster made
entirely of boulders. Insofar as the film has a message, it's about
being nice to your fans, because you need them more than you think.
This is borne out when the actors don't know how to make the
spaceship work, and have to phone one of their maniacal devotees on
Earth to get help. What's funniest, apart from Allen's riffs on the
has-been's ego, are the sweetly loopy aliens, tottering a la C3PO
up and down this or that very functional, very bare corridor.
``Galaxy Quest'' is a savvy little side dish of a movie.

`AFFAIR' SHOWS ITS CRAFT, BUT WASHES OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE END OF THE AFFAIR 
Written and directed by: Neil Jordan (based on Graham Greene's
novel) 
Starring: Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore, Stephen Rea, Ian Hart,
Jason Isaacs, James Bolam, Samuel Bould 
Running time: 105 minutes 
Rated: R (scenes of strong sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' is that most heartbreaking of artistic
endeavors _ the immaculately crafted film that just sits there and
refuses to come to life. Or at least not the extraordinary kind of
life it asks of itself. Maybe it's all the rain. It seems to be
raining all the time in Neil Jordan's downbeat take on Graham
Greene's semi-autobiographical World War II love story. Actually,
it's really more about the cost of love than about love itself,
although there are more than a few really sexy scenes between Ralph
Fiennes's novelist and Julianne Moore's appetite-filled but
unsatisfied wife of a diplomat. When they make love as the air raid
sirens howl, it's sometimes the Luftwaffe that makes the earth
move.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we can believe in the liberating sexiness, we also can
believe in the novelist's fulminating jealousy when after one
particular bomb blast the woman named Sarah inexplicably ends the
affair. The mystery of what made her do so is what occupies most of
the story, with copious flashbacks and no small amount of irony,
that begins just after the war, in the omnipresent drizzle, when
the husband asks the novelist, whom he met but never suspected was
cuckolding him, to trail his wife because she's been behaving
mysteriously. This sends the novelist into a much more agitated
state than the husband's. If she didn't end the affair to go back
to her husband, then who is her new love interest? It's consuming
him.
</P>
<P>
   If Greene saw himself in the novelist, it can't be said that he
painted a flattering self-portrait. Not all of Fiennes's acuity can
overcome the fact that the novelist is more than a bit of a pill.
Julianne Moore of the alabaster skin _ having herself quite a year,
what with ``An Ideal Husband'' and ``Magnolia'' _ fills the screen
with genteel anguish as well as a quite believably earthy side.
Yet, filled with grace as some of them are, the pieces never really
add up here, and the answer to the mystery, when it is revealed,
falls short of amazing us.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has been scrupulously faithful to Greene's novel and this
film at least is miles ahead of a 1955 version with Deborah Kerr
and Van Johnson. Longtime Jordan collaborator Stephen Rea does a
heroic job of projecting understated decency and thus is seemingly
sympathetic as the husband. Never is he merely a boring cuckold,
even if he apparently doesn't know enough to come in out of the
rain. Still, ``The End of the Affair'' falls stubbornly short of
making a serious bid to enter the pantheon of star-crossed lover
films. This waterlogged ``End of the Affair'' recalls ``The English
Patient,'' but with rain instead of sand.

THE CLICK BEFORE CHRISTMAS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, Virginia, there is an Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house,
</P>
<P>
   not a creature was stirring, not even the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Its duty was done _ click, click, click, click.
</P>
<P>
   And now we no longer needed St. Nick. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The packages were stacked near our doorstep with care.
</P>
<P>
   Like a cyberspace miracle, they landed there.
</P>
<P>
   All we must do is wrap them with glee
</P>
<P>
   and put them under our Christmas tree. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, out on the porch there arose such a clatter,
</P>
<P>
   we looked outside to see what was the matter.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mike down the street, with a problem, you see.
</P>
<P>
   He had nothing to put under his Christmas tree. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He ordered on line for Robert, who's 5.
</P>
<P>
   But, for some unknown reason, things never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``What should I do?'' he said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just say Santa's late,'' we smugly said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As he scampered off quickly, in search of a mall,
</P>
<P>
   I thought of the Christmas lists we used to scrawl.
</P>
<P>
   There were no videos, Nintendo or special Game Boy _
</P>
<P>
   just books, a doll, and a favorite toy. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We handed our list to Mom and to Dad;
</P>
<P>
   then just hoped Santa would make us real glad.
</P>
<P>
   The stores were special, filled with delights _
</P>
<P>
   garlands and ornaments, red and green lights. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They went up in December _ not early fall _
</P>
<P>
   and the mood was as bright as a winter snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   It was a treat, way back then, to go to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   We'd go at Christmas and have quite a ball. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But then, something happened, I'm not quite sure why.
</P>
<P>
   It was no longer fun; the stores made us cry.
</P>
<P>
   The parking, the lines, the unfriendly clerks.
</P>
<P>
   The people around us, they were always such jerks. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make even an old-fashioned girl,
</P>
<P>
   think the new-fangled Net could be worth a whirl.
</P>
<P>
   I clicked on a Web site, and it hit like a bomb:
</P>
<P>
   There was Land's End and J. Crew and eToys.com. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just give up your credit card, click on the mouse,
</P>
<P>
   and wait for the goodies to fill up your house.
</P>
<P>
   At first, I was nervous. Was it a safe bet?
</P>
<P>
   Could I shop til I drop and not break a sweat? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, said my husband, with manly disdain.
</P>
<P>
   You can run up our debt in sun or in rain.
</P>
<P>
   I did the clothes and he did the toys.
</P>
<P>
   Even in cyberspace, boys will be boys. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We filled up our carts and clicked once to send.
</P>
<P>
   And simple as that, our spree came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   No crowds, no headaches, no hassles, no fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Just a purring PC _ and the two of us. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's scary how simple it could be to spread joy
</P>
<P>
   to a 6-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Laying a finger alongside my nose,
</P>
<P>
   I shut down the computer and walked off on tiptoes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The kids were asleep as I said with delight:
</P>
<P>
   Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mike down the street _ well, things are not yet quite
right.
</P>
<P>
   He still needs a miracle this Christmas night!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(End poetry style) &QL;

`RIPLEY' A SEDUCTIVE LOOK AT DEVIOUSNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

Written and directed by: Anthony Minghella (based on Patricia
Highsmith's novel) 
Starring: Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Cate Blanchett,
Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jack Davenport, James Rebhorn, Sergio
Rubini, Philip Baker Hall 
Running time: 160 minutes 
Rated: R (violence, language and brief nudity)

<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is a slick, twisty, top-of-the-line
crime thriller with gorgeously sensual textures and a screenful of
wickedly faceted performances. But mostly it's the film's avoidance
of simplistic good guy-bad guy labeling that sets it apart. It
grabs us as gradually as temptation grabs Matt Damon's have-not
with his smiling face pressed up against the lifestyle he'd love to
make a permanent part of his life. ``The Talented Mr. Ripley''
knows how corruption works. That's what makes it such an
entertainingly seductive and then unsettling carnival of
deviousness.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Highsmith, who wrote the novel on which the movie is
based, believed that crime, even murder, was not the product of
intrinsically evil people, but of one thing leading to another.
That's the way it happens here as Damon's impoverished 1958 college
grad gets a job playing piano at a rich man's party, is mistaken
for a guest, then is mistaken for a college buddy of the rich man's
playboy son who is knocking around Europe spending the old man's
money, much to the latter's annoyance. So James Rebhorn's grumpy
tycoon hires Damon's Tom Ripley to go to Europe and bring the
spendthrift home. Almost immediately the deviousness starts.
</P>
<P>
   Before he even lays eyes on Jude Law's golden boy, Dickie
Greenleaf, Ripley has a shipboard encounter with Cate Blanchett's
slightly out-of-it socialite, whose yearning parallels his in ways
she'll never know. Not wanting to present himself to her as her
social inferior, he introduces himself as Dickie Greenleaf. She
buys the lie. For a moment, they're soulmates in yearning, sharing
a communion that only he's clued into. She has money, but not the
entree she thinks Dickie can give her. He has neither money nor
entree, but his mind starts racing after both.
</P>
<P>
   It's at that point that Ripley's smile changes. His toothy grin,
initially boyish and open, starts looking like the root of all
evil. We wouldn't feel the evil if we didn't first feel the
yearning. And the yearning in Ripley's case is nothing more than
good old American ambition and social climbing. We also sense that
the corruption begins in Ripley's rejection of himself because he's
poor. Part of the reason he's such a chameleon is that he feels
empty inside. He feels he has no identity worth asserting. From
there, it's the shortest of leaps to his belief that it's better to
be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
</P>
<P>
   He begins by co-opting Dickie as soon as he meets him, becoming
a double agent by telling Dickie of his father's scheme, proposing
to subvert it by joining forces to spend even more of the old man's
money. Then he begins charming Dickie, bonding with him by feigning
an interest in jazz. He also gets on the good side of Dickie's
girlfriend, Marge, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. They become a
pleasure-seeking threesome, tooling around the warmer precincts of
Italy when la vita was still dolce for rich Americans. The film
would quickly capsize if Law's privileged Dickie wasn't so
believably charismatic, so convincingly cavalier. Next to him,
Ripley, in his specs and corduroy jacket, seems a bit of a dork.
Marge, pressuring Dickie for a commitment, seems brittle.
</P>
<P>
   Bookending Blanchett's deb on the periphery of the story is
Philip Seymour Hoffman's arrogant boor, using his money and
position like a truncheon on poor Tom. Where Blanchett's Meredith
is dense but good-hearted, Hoffman's Freddie is into social
thuggery. If anyone is to die, and you can feel the slippery slope
steepening, you want it to be him. Sure enough, there is a killing.
It happens in an unplanned way, but once it does, everything starts
accelerating, including Ripley's improvisational giftedness, a
surprising revelation of emotional depth in Marge, and the
realization of just how deadly the oedipal war was that Ripley
stepped into between the son on the run and his disapproving
father.
</P>
<P>
   The acting is filled with enlivening detail and specificity.
Damon, revealing a much more explicit and explicitly ruinous
revelation of Ripley's gay crush on Dickie, with this single role
in this singular film impressively extends his reach as an actor.
The others compel as much respect, too. As he showed in ``The
English Patient,'' director Anthony Minghella has a real talent for
conjuring up a sense of place, in this case the seductive
languorousness of the Italian Riviera, where the temptation to
drink a late breakfast in a rented villa with history in every
stone, then sun yourself on the deck of a rented cabin cruiser, is
so irresistible that you can all but feel it dragging Ripley into
its gravitational field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is ``The Great Gatsby'' of crime
capers, as Ripley tries on Dickie's clothes and wonders what it
would be like to try on his life as well. The sun gives way to the
grave clarity of gray skies after Dickie seduces a local woman to
dire effect and we begin to feel the whole charmed interlude slip
away. The emotional jolts, when they come, hit harder than the
proverbial blunt instrument. Minghella's changes most notably
involve, in addition to more overt displays of Ripley's homosexual
attraction to Dickie, a string of male betrayals sustained by
Paltrow's Marge. The film falters in its ending. But Ripley never
does, and neither do any of the players. Like Ripley, the film
takes its cue from jazzy riffs, enjoying the danger of hurtling to
parts unknown.

   COPS-TRIAL (Albany, N.Y.) _ The judge picked to preside over the
trial of four white New York City police officers charged with
murdering a West African immigrant in the Bronx is a tough jurist
known for running an orderly courtroom. State Supreme Court Justice

   REINDEER (Albany, N.Y.) _ We hear about them once a year. They
have Teutonic names like Donner, Blitzen and Rudolph, and lead a
sleigh from the North Pole, delivering presents throughout the
world. That's fine for Hollywood. But in the cruel, sub-freezing
chill of the arctic, the truth is not so glamorous. The North Pole
part is accurate enough; reindeer predominate in Lapland, on the
polar fringes of Scandinavia. The sleigh-driving days are fading,
however, as the Lapps (who like to be called Sami), herd the
domesticated beasts with snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles. Cute
to children at Christmas, reindeer are food and business to these
herdsmen. Think pelts. Think shoes. Or a variety of delicacies from
smoked reindeer heart to reindeer strips on mashed potatoes with
reindeer gravy and lingonberries. By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN.

   NEWYEAR _ ATLANTA _ Rosalyn McCrary had a bad case of the
Millenium jitters. The banquet server at the Marriott Hotel at
Lenox was scheduled to work New Year's Eve but feared leaving her
young son at home alone. So she approached her boss about the
problem. That discussion set into motion a novel way to help
workesrs cope with being sepArated during the holiday. The hotel
management has set aside 50 rooms _ that go for mroe than $200 a
night _ for employees and their families. The hotel will pay the
costs of the room and food for the night. It's a small price to pay
for their peace of mind, said the hotel's GM. (Poole, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   SHOPLIFTING _ It's a gangbuster holiday season for retailers,
but it's also one for shoplifters. The more shoppers in retail
stores, the greater the chance that the employees will be
distracted. Thieves are lifting everything from athletic shoes to
CD's, which rank among the nation's most stolen items, according to
a 1998-1999 study conducted by Loss Prevention Specialists, a
consulting group in Winter Park, Fla. (Degross, Atlanta

the spiritual and commercial side of the holiday. (Blake, Atlanta

   CHRISTIAN-MUSIC _ DAYTON, Ohio _ James Lloyd looks at the top 10
artists who helped the Christian music explosion in the 1990s. It's
now the No. 5 most popular musical genre, ahead of jazz, metal,
classical and Latin music. Do not use before Dec. 26. (Lloyd,

<P>
   Eds: The following package on the truth behind Jesus and his
story has moved through the week and is moving again for today:
</P>
<P>
   JESUS-APPEARANCE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jesus Christ is
worshiped as the human incarnation of the son of God, and his
likeness has been reproduced for hundreds of years by thousands of
artists. But they've all been making it up. The Apostles were
assiduous in copying down Jesus' message, but no one bothered to
write about his appearance. We know some things he said, but not at
all how he sounded. And though Bible readers are given vague hints
about the visage of the Prince of Peace, even those are
contradictory. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JESUS-CRUCIFY _ The spikes nailed through Jesus' wrists and
ankles did not kill him. The crown of thorns that cut into his brow
was little more than a nuisance, and the whipping he endured before
he was crucified was almost an act of mercy. (Belkin, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JESUS-LIFE _ Jesus may have been the Prince of Peace, but if his
life was at all typical of his fellow Nazarenes in the first
century, he didn't live like royalty while he was growing up.
(Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JESUS-MISTLETOE _ The mistletoe you're trying to get caught
under this Christmas season wasn't always the semi-parasitic plant
it is today. According to an old French folk story, mistletoe used
to be a tree in its own right until it was caught in the wrong
place at the wrong time. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JESUS-GIFTS _ It takes a little of the magic away from the Magi
to be able to buy frankincense and myrrh for $2.95 in the incense
department at just about any New Age bookstore. But in their day,
the Three Wise Men had a different set of circumstances with which
to deal. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

REINDEER IN LAPLAND AREN'T JUST FOR SLEIGHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ We hear about them once a year. They have
Teutonic names like Donner, Blitzen and Rudolph, and lead a sleigh
from the North Pole, delivering presents throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine for Hollywood. But in the cruel, sub-freezing chill
of the arctic, the truth is not so glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   The North Pole part is accurate enough; reindeer predominate in
Lapland, on the polar fringes of Scandinavia. The sleigh-driving
days are fading, however, as the Lapps (who like to be called
Sami), herd the domesticated beasts with snowmobiles and
all-terrain vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Cute to children at Christmas, reindeer are food and business to
these herdsmen. Think pelts. Think shoes. Or a variety of
delicacies from smoked reindeer heart to reindeer strips on mashed
potatoes with reindeer gravy and lingonberries.
</P>
<P>
   These were among the observations of a group of University at
Albany researchers who visited Finnish Lapland in June under a
3-year, $205,000 National Science Foundation Grant to explore 4
arctic locales. Their purpose was as rooted in '90s values as
reindeer tales are mired in Christmas past: to look at gender roles
among reindeer herders, and show that women in indigenous societies
play an active role in the hunting and processing of food.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Jarvenpa, chair of the UAlbany anthropology department,
sees it as filling in the blanks in the anthropological record,
where women have often been kept on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional view is that women are attached to the home
and hearth,'' he said. ``But if you're actually on the scene,
looking at how these people actually make a living, that view
breaks down.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvenpa and Hetty Jo Brumbach, associate curator of
anthropology and co-investigator on the grant, found that even
though men are usually dispatched to kill large animals, women play
a huge role in scouting the game, butchering and processing the
animals.
</P>
<P>
   The pair have traveled to the polar nether-regions of Northern
Canada and Alaska and will go to Siberia this summer to complete
their review.
</P>
<P>
   These unexplored regions, rich in oil and mineral reserves, have
been relatively untouched by industrialization, Jarvenpa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area of the world was contacted rather late by Europeans
and industry is a very recent phenomenon there,'' he said. ``It's a
very unpopulated part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the reindeer population (roughly 700,000 in
Scandinavia) far outnumbers the human population.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvenpa said he didn't hear much about the Christmas-notion of
reindeer in his travels, although much of the story _ including
Santa Claus' elves and their pointy hats _ derives from the dress
of the Sami people and their small frames.
</P>
<P>
   The yuletide lore largely derives from the 1822 poem by Clement
Clarke Moore, known today as ``'Twas the Night Before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph and his red nose didn't appear until 1939, as a
promotional gimmick by an American retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Such ideas seem remote when reindeer is your daily sustenance,
Jarvenpa said. He sampled a wide variety of reindeer cuisine on his
trip, including reindeer soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tasty,'' he said.

JUDGE IN TRIAL OF POLICEMAN HAS REPUTATION AS TOUGH JURIST

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Judge picked to preside over the trial of
four white New York City police officers charged with murdering a
West African immigrant in the Bronx is a tough jurist known for

   State Supreme Court Justice Joseph C. Teresi was named Thursday

Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy. The officers are charged with
second-degree murder and reckless endangerment in the Feb. 4
shooting of Amadou Diallo. They are accused of firing 41 bullets,
hitting the unarmed victim 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo case is Teresi's most high-profile assignment in his
six years as a judge. Earlier, he spent more than 20 years as an
assistant public defender who represented hundreds of criminal
court defendants in Albany County.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Chief Administrative Judge Jonathan Lippman, head of
the administrative arm of the state court system, ends a week of
speculation over which Albany judge would get the controversial
police brutality case.
</P>
<P>
   The case was moved from the Bronx because of widespread
publicity and anti-police protests after the fatal shooting. The
cops maintain they believed Diallo, a street vendor who had never
been in trouble with the law, was reaching for a gun. The incident
occurred while police were searching for a rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi will be in the spotlight because critics see Albany as a
conservative community with a smaller minority population than in
the Bronx. The appointment has already drawn criticism from New
York City activists.
</P>
<P>
   The choice came down to Teresi and Supreme Court Justice Thomas
W. Keegan, the administrative judge in this area. Keegan was viewed
as too busy. As police court judge in 1988, Keegan sentenced the
Rev. Al Sharpton and folk singer Pete Seeger and 10 others to 15
days in jail after a protest here. Sharpton is a key figure in the
Diallo protests, but it is not known whether that sentencing had
any impact on the Teresi assignment.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for the start of the trial, although it
could begin as early as Jan. 31, sources said. The Office of Court
Administration may announce a date next week, spokesman David
Bookstaver said.
</P>
<P>
   A New York City appellate court last week moved the case from
the Bronx to Albany to ensure the officers a fair trial. The court
agreed with defense lawyers that widespread news coverage of the
incident and public sentiment, which erupted in demonstrations,
would make it impossible to seat an impartial jury in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi, 53, a Democrat, has handled several criminal proceedings
since becoming a judge, although most of his cases have been civil
matters, the primary focus of the Supreme Court in upstate
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Teresi, who had long sought a judgeship, was easily elected in
November 1993, running with the endorsement of Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an excellent trial judge, and I'm sure he'll do a fine
job,'' Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed as a tough but even-handed jurist, Teresi takes charge of
the courtroom and expects lawyers to proceed in an orderly fashion.
He has been stern, sometimes to the consternation of trial
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   He is well-versed in the penal code and criminal law procedure,
having worked as a part-time assistant Albany County public
defender between July 1972 and Dec. 31, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   From 1973 until his judgeship, Teresi was an associate and later
a partner with the Albany law firm of Ainsworth, Sullivan Tracy,
Knauf, Warner and Ruslander. As a trial attorney, his emphasis was
on defense litigation in torts, products liability, malpractice,
civil rights violations and industrial accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of Teresi's assignment, dissidents in New York City
were crying foul. Randy Credico of the William Moses Kunstler Fund
for Racial Justice said he had been researching both Teresi and
Keegan, expecting either to be named. The agency focuses mostly on
trying to achieve justice for defendants convicted under the strict
Rockefeller drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   Credico said he doesn't believe that Teresi or Keegan would be
impartial. He said he is forwarding his research on Teresi to
Sharpton who has denounced the moving of the trial to Albany.
Credico is attempting to research Teresi's record regarding
sentencing of minority defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I categorically believe that under no uncertain terms this man
(Teresi) will be pro-defense in this case,'' Credico said. ``When
you become a Supreme Court justice in a conservative city like
Albany _ and even though there are a lot of Democrats, I call them
southern Democrats _ you have to become more pro-prosecution and
pro-police.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, on Thursday at the same time Teresi was being named,
inmate Elaine Bartlett was granted clemency by Gov. George Pataki.
She was sentenced to 20 years to life in Albany County in 1984
under the Rockefeller laws while represented by Assistant Public
Defender Teresi, Credico said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Office of Court Administration ``thinks they gave us the
soft one, someone to mollify the protesters down here, they're
wrong,'' Credico said. ``Judge Teresi is going to be met with just
as much resistance as Thomas Keegan.''
</P>
<P>
   Teresi declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstaver defended the choice. ``This was not a quick
decision,'' he said. ``Judge Lippman has been deliberating for
several days. It was an important decision.'' Lippman consulted
with Judge Joseph J. Traficanti Jr., the deputy chief
administrative judge for courts outside of New York City, and
Justice Anthony V. Cardona, the presiding justice of the Appellate
Division in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Taken into consideration was availability, Bookstaver said. ``We
had to find a judge available to take this case right now. Keeping
the case on track was an important factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Expertise was considered, he said, although all the judges
considered were certainly qualified. Demeanor was looked at, along
with fairness, he said. Also it was decided to not choose a county
judge so as not to create a backlog of felony cases in that court.

NEW YORK GRANTS CLEMENCY TO FOUR CONVICTED UNDER STATE'S DRUG LAW

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Four prison inmates serving time under New York
state's harsh Rockefeller Drug Laws have been granted clemency in a
yuletide gesture of mercy by Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's decision on Thursday to commute the prison
sentences of Elaine Bartlett, Robert Bavisotto, Jan Warren and
Arlene Oberg does not mean they will be released automatically. All
four will appear early next month before the state Parole Board.
</P>
<P>
   But generally, the Parole Board gives quick releases to inmates
who have been granted gubernatorial clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just very happy _ it's so great that she's coming
home,'' an emotional Robert Bartlett said of his mother, Elaine,
who has been incarcerated at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility
since 1984 and had twice applied for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to try to make up for the last 15 years,'' said Robert
Bartlett, who was nine when his mother went to prison. ``She's
missed a lot, and we've missed a lot. It's like a brand-new
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Bartlett was convicted of selling four ounces of cocaine
in a Latham, N.Y., motel and was sentenced to 20 years to life in
prison. Bartlett, 42, was one of four inmates profiled by the Times
Union this year in a series on the Rockefeller Drug Laws.
</P>
<P>
   Under the laws _ which set mandatory minimum sentences of 15
years to life for possessing or selling relatively small amounts of
narcotics _ drug felons in New York are often more severely
punished than defendants convicted of violent crimes like rape and
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of the 71,000 people in state prisons are
serving time under the Rockefeller Drug Laws, according to data
provided by the Correctional Association of New York State. While
most gubernatorial clemencies were granted to murderers 25 years
ago, nearly all in the last two decades have gone to drug felons,
state records show.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki did not grant clemency to any of the inmates who applied
for release in 1998. In October, however, he gave clemency to
Patricia Feerick, a former police lieutenant in New York City who
was serving a two-year jail term after being convicted of
vandalizing a Harlem apartment during a drug raid.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal justice experts had feared Pataki would not give
clemency to the more than 175 other inmates who applied for mercy
this year as the GOP governor seeks to be considered for national
office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``While I remain firmly committed to continuing our
successful efforts to fight crime, these individuals have worked
hard to earn a second chance,'' Pataki said in a statement released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The three women up for release also had a powerful ally in their
corner: Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, R-Brunswick, who in
July called on the governor to give clemency to Bartlett, Warren
and Oberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we looked at their backgrounds, we just feel that they
have paid their penalty sufficiently to society,'' Bruno said
Thursday. ``There just isn't any merit to keeping them
incarcerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said all four inmates to win clemency Thursday excelled
in educational, vocational and volunteer programs while in prison.
All four were also first-time offenders who were given long
sentences for drug sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bavisottserved 18 years of his minimum 20-to-life
sentence. He tutored inmates in math and electrical work, taught
himself computer science and completed his first year of college.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, 47, earned an associate degree from Mercy College and
began work on her bachelor's degree from Marymount College while at
Bedford Hills. Warren served 12 years of her 15-to-life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Oberg, 33, earned her high school equivalency degree and her
associate degree and is working toward her bachelor's degree. She
gave birth to her daughter, Lisa, while serving 11 years of her
20-to-life sentence at Bedford Hills. Now 11, Lisa met with Bruno
last year to ask for her mother's release.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, who served 16 years of her 20-to-life sentence, earned
her bachelor's degree and is working toward a master's. She
volunteered as a child care aide and in Bedford Hills' literacy
program.
</P>
<P>
   For the immediate future, ``she just wants to spend a lot of
time with us,'' Robert Bartlett said. ``We've only been able to see
her once every other month.''

</P>
<P>
   CHRISTMAS-POPE (Rome) _ In a moment he has been waiting for his
entire papacy, John Paul II on Friday night will open the Holy Door
to Saint Peter's basilica, ushering in a Holy Year that is intended
to set the tone for the entire third millennium. Before celebrating
Christmas Midnight Mass, John Paul II, following a 500-year-old
ritual, will push open wide doors that are kept bricked up until a
Holy Year begins, and sink to his knees in prayer while a choir
sings a Latin acclamation. By Alessandra Stanley.

Minister Barak appoints a team to negotiate with Lebanon. By Joel

</P>
<P>
   INDIA-HIJACK (Dateline to kum) _ Developing. An Indian Airlines
plane carrying about 180 people from Nepal to New Delhi was
hijacked today and flown to Pakistan. Hijackers demanding fuel and
food. India says 4 people have been killed on the plane. The

</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-SHOPPING (Undated) _ The millennium may turn out to be a
bust, but Christmas 1999 was swinging. Official data will not be
available until early January _ and many of the biggest shopping
days are still to come with post-season sales _ but already retail
analysts are saying the nation's largest stores are right on track
to see a rise in purchasing well in excess of 6 percent. That would
make 1999 the strongest Christmas season since 1992, a fitting, and
not unexpected climax to a year where Americans _ encouraged by a
soaring stock market and rising wages _ have indulged in a
sustained shopping spree. By Leslie Kaufman.

</P>
<P>
   EGYPT-BEER (Cairo) _ When the Egyptian government put the
national beer company up for sale a few years ago, nobody was
buying. But Ahmed Zayat, a 30ish Egyptian wheeler-dealer who had
worked for Wall Street firms, saw a gold mine. Nearly three years
after taking control of the company, Al Ahram Beverages, Zayat has
turned it into one of the best performing companies in Egypt. With
the help of consultants from Carlsberg, the Swedish brewer, he has
begun turning out first rate beer. And he has discovered that the
real gold may be in a line of non-alcoholic beers _ some with
apple, lemon and strawberry flavors. Zayat's success has been a
catalyst for a new wave of investment in Egypt. The beer company
was just one of more than 300 state-owned companies that the
government had been hoping to sell as Egypt took the lead in a
shift across the Middle East from centrally planned economies to
free enterprise. By Joseph B. Treaster.

<P>
   BOND-RATES (Undated) _ For much of this year, the question had
been: What happens if there are real computer generated problems at
the turn to the Year 2000? But as the year wound to a close _ and
as the fears of Year 2000 faded _ the question has changed to: What
if there are no Year 2000 computer problems? That switch in
sentiment, prompted in part by the Federal Reserve's efforts to
assure that financial markets function as smoothly as possible at
year's end, has already helped push Treasury interest rates higher
as investors have decided that they do not need the safe harbor of
the Treasury market. And Treasury interest rates could move even
higher in early January if, indeed, Year 2000 turns out to be not
much more than a computer blip. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.
</P>
<P>
   KODAK-FISHER (Rochester, N.Y.) _ George M.C. Fisher, Eastman
Kodak's chief executive, talks about his turnaround effort, as he
prepares to say goodbye. A Q&AMP;A by Claudia H. Deutsch.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-TOBACCO (Undated) _ The California state treasurer imposes
a moratorium on state investments in tobacco stocks and asks the
state's big public employee pension fund to consider divesting its
shares. By Milt Freudenheim.
</P>
<P>
   LATIN-Y2K (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ With less than a week to go, no
one is quite sure what the fallout will be from Latin America's
approach to dealing with the Year 2000 problem. Some of the
region's poorest countries, like Paraguay, are drastically
ill-prepared, while other nations, like Chile and Mexico, planned
ahead and budgeted funds to sufficiently adapt their government
computers. Nevertheless, there appears to be a consensus emerging
among the people who have been rushing to prepare the region: The
parts of Latin America most at risk are also the most
technologically advanced, while the most underdeveloped regions,
while they will almost surely also be affected by the problem, are
not likely to suffer as much as the pockets of wealth. By Simon
Romero.

   NEW-RELIGIONS (Undated) _ Studying new religions is a growing

</P>
<P>
   MODERN-MASKS (Undated) _ Once upon a time masks belonged to
anthropology. They were strange objects made of wood, shells,
feathers and bells that primitives wore for coming-of-age rituals,
funerary rites, rain dances, fertility festivals and seasonal
get-togethers. Modern people also wear masks: hockey masks, gas
masks, surgical masks. You could say that modern masks are just for
protection. You could also say that hockey, war and surgery are
rituals and that these masks reveal something about the
relationships of the people who wear them. And now puppeteers,
artists and dramatists are spinning their own theories about the
place of masks in modern culture now, and they are finding that it
is not all kinship or cranial protection. By Barbara Boxer. (1300

</P>
<P>
   ZERO (Undated) _ Before the millennium gasps its last tired
breath, a final tribute must be paid to something overlooked. It
might seem to be nothing, yet during the last 1,000 years it has
transformed physics, mathematics, commerce and the shape of Western
civilization. That something is nothing. And that nothing is marked
by something. The object in question is the number zero. And zero,
whose presence declares absence, is a cipher in more ways than one
_ or maybe in more ways than none. Edward Rothstein looks at two
recents books about zero. (1000 words)

   MODERN-MASKS (Undated) _ Once upon a time masks belonged to
anthropology. They were strange objects made of wood, shells,
feathers and bells that primitives wore for coming-of-age rituals,
funerary rites, rain dances, fertility festivals and seasonal
get-togethers. Modern people also wear masks: hockey masks, gas
masks, surgical masks. You could say that modern masks are just for
protection. You could also say that hockey, war and surgery are
rituals and that these masks reveal something about the
relationships of the people who wear them. And now puppeteers,
artists and dramatists are spinning their own theories about the
place of masks in modern culture now, and they are finding that it
is not all kinship or cranial protection. By Barbara Boxer. (1300

   ZERO (Undated) _ Before the millennium gasps its last tired
breath, a final tribute must be paid to something overlooked. It
might seem to be nothing, yet during the last 1,000 years it has
transformed physics, mathematics, commerce and the shape of Western
civilization. That something is nothing. And that nothing is marked
by something. The object in question is the number zero. And zero,
whose presence declares absence, is a cipher in more ways than one
_ or maybe in more ways than none. Edward Rothstein looks at two
recents books about zero. (1000 words)

have acquired Mike Piazza, Robin Ventura, Armando Benitez and now
Mike Hampton. No team has been as aggressive in piling on talent,

with the world champion Yankees and are trying to compete. By

ECONOMIC VIEW: VIRGINIA GOVERNOR LEADS CHARGE AGAINST TAXING
INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 26)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To listen to Virginia Gov. James Gilmore, a
conservative, tax-cutting Republican, the escalating debate over
whether to make the Internet a permanently tax-free shopping zone
is no contest.
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside concerns that state and local sales tax revenue
would dry up as shoppers fled the malls for the Web. He suggested
that traditional retailers should stop whining about unfair
competition from the Internet and start viewing the technology as
an opportunity to build new markets. And he said the best economic
strategy is to nurture the Web's potential to preserve the
competitive advantage that is the basis of the America's current
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the slightest interest in destroying the tax base
of cities, states and counties,'' said Gilmore in an interview.
``But there is an interesting philosophical debate going on here.
Some politicians are basically saying that you have to have
fairness and a level playing field. Since we're going to have a
sales tax, we have to apply it to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Gilmore said, is precisely the wrong approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government is entitled to the revenue it needs to provide
services, but it is not entitled to reach into new areas to get
revenues it doesn't need,'' he said. ``Government is not entitled
to a taxation windfall just because a new industry has emerged.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were any doubts that the Internet is reshaping the
economy in fundamental and far-reaching ways, they were dispelled
this year, as dot-com stocks drove Wall Street, as the stodgiest of
corporations embraced the power of the Web and as technology-driven
enhancements in business efficiency startled Alan Greenspan and his
colleagues at the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But economic policy-makers are only beginning to respond, and
the political parties are just starting to recognize the potency of
technology-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   No issue has had a higher profile in recent months than tax-free
cybershopping, a perk (or quirk) of electronic commerce that
millions of consumers enjoyed for the first time this holiday
shopping season. Online shoppers usually must pay for shipping, but
rarely pay any sales tax on goods bought from companies that do not
have physical presence, like a store or a warehouse, in the state
where they live.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has come up regularly in the presidential campaign.
Both Al Gore and George W. Bush have said they favor extending the
current moratorium on Internet taxation while the matter is
studied, but are concerned about the fallout for state finances and
traditional retailers. Most of Bush's Republican rivals want to
make the moratorium permanent.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tough issue, raising questions of fairness and ideology
without providing much middle ground on which a compromise can be
built, and there are passionate voices on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   But no one argues the case against Internet taxation more
vociferously or with greater certitude than Gilmore. He has built
his political identity on tax cutting, and the state he governs is
home to one of the most successful technology corridors outside
California, with America Online among his many Internet-dependent
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore was chosen by Republican leaders in Congress to be
chairman of a national commission studying the issue. Its latest
meeting, this month in San Francisco, reached a deadlock between
members who think applying sales tax to electronic transactions is
both proper and technically feasible and those, like Gilmore, who
think it would be a mistake and would anyway be too complicated to
enforce.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Gilmore said, there is no sign that online sales
are coming at the expense of traditional retailers or are eating
into state and local tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistical data will have to come later,'' he said. ``But
at this point you only have to look into the stores and the malls
and ask, `How's business?' Business is booming. There is no
evidence I can see that sales tax revenue is down or that commerce
in traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing is down.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's message to traditional retailers, especially
local stores, is to stop fighting the Internet and embrace it:
``It's wonderful for small business. It's a dynamic development
that gives small-business people the ability to broaden their bases
and compete with big business.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore acknowledged the importance of ensuring Internet access
for the poor, so online commerce and its benefits will not flow
only to those who can afford computers and monthly service fees.
</P>
<P>
   His bottom line is that because no one can foresee precisely how
electronic commerce will develop or what its economic effects will
be, the best policy is to bar the door to Internet sales taxes. But
that same uncertainty might equally argue for a more flexible
approach, one that does not prejudge where technology will drive an
economy now changing in ways no one yet fully grasps.

FROM HARVARD TO HARRAH'S, IN SEARCH OF FREQUENT GAMBLERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Gary Loveman, chief operating officer of Harrah's
Entertainment, thinks gamblers are promiscuous. ``We have customers
who play around with everybody,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He is referring not to bedroom habits, but rather to gamblers'
lack of loyalty to any particular casino company. Loveman, a former
Harvard Business School professor, is trying to change that. If he
succeeds, he will have created a new model for growth in the casino
business.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's has invested more than $100 million in computers and
software to develop what is widely regarded as the industry's most
sophisticated ``frequent bettor'' program. Like airline
frequent-flier plans, Harrah's ``Total Rewards'' program awards
participants with perks _ in this case, rooms, meals and other
benefits _ and bombards them with promotional mail.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to grow by getting more business from Harrah's
existing casinos and customer base. That is in contrast to the
strategy of other companies: building splashy new casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge margin for profitable growth without having to
build ever more elaborate and sophisticated facilities,'' said
Loveman, wearing a pullover shirt at Harrah's headquarters here,
where everyone else seemed to be in suits. It is, he said, ``the
triumph of software over hardware in gaming.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, analysts say, the strategy is working. Harrah's and its
chief executive, Philip Satre, have received praise from trade
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Coccimiglio, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said
Harrah's has had greater revenue growth in most markets than the
industry as a whole, despite having casinos that are far from the
fanciest. In the third quarter, he said, Harrah's grew nearly three
times as fast as the overall market in Laughlin, Nev., and twice as
fast in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Even rivals have praise for the initiative. ``Harrah's has done
far better than anyone at that, and they've developed a brand in an
industry that's brandless,'' said James Murren, chief financial
officer of MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   But Harry Curtis, an analyst at Robertson Stephens, cautioned
that it was too early to tell how much of the success stemmed from
Harrah's strategy and how much from the overall strength of the
gambling business.
</P>
<P>
   Loveman, 39, received his doctorate in economics from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and became an assistant
professor at the Harvard Business School, writing papers or books
on topics from technology to East European economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   He also taught a popular course in the management of service
companies. ``That was his real obsession,'' said Thomas DeLong, a
professor of management at Harvard. He said it was not unusual for
professors there to go into consulting or investment banking, but
that gambling was a bit of a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Loveman taught a training course at Promus
Cos., predecessor to Harrah's. He was smitten by gambling _ as a
business and as an academic challenge, though not as a pastime.
``It's a data-rich industry,'' he said, ``and analytically it's
quite sophisticated,'' making it an ideal place to test his
theories.
</P>
<P>
   Loveman wrote an unsolicited letter to Satre offering ideas on
how the company could grow. He was hired as a consultant. Later, in
May 1998, though he had never held a full-time corporate job,
Loveman was hired as chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Satre said an outsider was needed to carry out Harrah's
marketing effort.``If there's an analogy, it's Lou Gerstner going
into IBM,'' he said, referring to Gerstner's move from RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Harrah's started its rewards program, in which
customers are issued a card that they insert into slot machines and
that keeps track of how much they gamble. Other casinos have
similar programs, but Harrah's offers it on a national basis, with
the points valid at any of its 19 casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This works because we have the broadest distribution of
properties,'' Satre said. To expand its empire, Harrah's in the
last two years has bought the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and
the Showboat chain and has agreed to acquire Players International
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry that generally develops its talent internally,
Loveman has hired data-mining and marketing experts from companies
like American Express. New software has been developed that not
only keeps track of how much customers gamble but predicts who
might be induced to gamble more. The database, which includes
anyone who stays at a Harrah's hotel, now contains more than 18
million names, of which about 9 million are card holders.
Sixty-five percent of the gambling in the company's casinos is now
done by its 9 million card holders, and the revenue from
cross-market customers _ people who play in more than one Harrah's
casino _ has risen more than 30 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   While such databases raise privacy issues, Loveman said the
company does not sell the list to other companies. He dismissed any
concerns that constant promotions could be creating problem
gamblers, saying the company removes anyone from the mailing list
who requests it.
</P>
<P>
   Officially on a two-year leave from Harvard that ends in June,
Loveman spends weekends with his wife and three children at his
home in Wellesley, Mass. But he said that when his leave expires,
he will resign from the ivory tower to stay at Harrah's. ``It's
been certainly the most exciting period of time I've had in my
professional life,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the dance show ``Swing'' opened on Broadway in
early December, the audience had an unusual component: about 50
people in the packed theater had turned up not only to see the
show, but also to see how their investment in it had turned out _
and to celebrate afterward at a new dance club called Exit.
</P>
<P>
   As the song from ``Cabaret'' says, ``Money makes the world go
around.'' That goes for Broadway, too.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance on the Great White Way may be booming, but those
willing to put money into what remains a high-risk, low-return
investment are still hard to come by. As mounting a show becomes
more expensive _ musicals now cost $5 million to $12 million _
producers have been forced to rethink how they finance their
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations like SFX Entertainment, Walt Disney and Cablevision
_ which have produced shows like ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde,'' ``Beauty and
the Beast'' and ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' respectively _ are
digging deeper into their own pockets to mount the splashy
productions that attract big audiences _ and to sustain those that
need time to build an audience after bad reviews (read
``Footloose'').
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime producers are toying with a structure _ similar to
that of a mutual fund _ in which they would establish a pool of
money from investors to support several productions, rather than
raising money project by project.
</P>
<P>
   And the producers of ``Swing'' _ Steven Baruch, a onetime real
estate developer, and his partners Richard Frankel, Thomas Viertel
and Marc Routh _ continue to finance Broadway and off-Broadway
shows as much as possible by shaking the trees for $10,000
increments from a multitude of individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   What's in it for investors? Potential profit, first of all;
investing in theater is by no means an altruistic endeavor. And
there are a few perks: prime tickets to opening night, the
occasionally star-studded party afterward, and other extras like
framed posters, cast recordings or souvenir books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Backing a show is different than just going to the theater,''
said Andrew Benerofe, a real estate investor and developer who said
he had never turned down the opportunity to put $10,000 into one of
Baruch's productions. ``You live with the construction and building
of a show.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, have reason to be cautious. Despite the
strong economy and the revival of Times Square, theater remains a
risky investment. With only one of five shows breaking even in the
average year _ let alone making a profit _ big investors in the
shows that fail still stand to be burned.
</P>
<P>
   David Richenthal, who produced last season's hit revival of
``Death of a Salesman,'' said he warns his investors with a
standard speech: ``It's like drilling for oil. There can be two or
three dry holes, but if you stay with it, you can hit a gusher.''
(The critically acclaimed ``Salesman,'' of course, qualifies as a
gusher.)
</P>
<P>
   Because oil drillers are hard to come by, the producers of
``Swing'' raise money one modest investor at a time. Baruch said
the strategy has paid off: if someone had put $10,000 into every
show he and his colleagues have produced since they started 15
years ago, that investor would have seen an internal rate of return
of about 41 percent a year. ``I dare say I doubt anybody has a
better track record,'' Baruch said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for ``Swing,'' which cost $5.6 million, the Baruch group
raised only about $1.5 million from individuals. Baruch said it was
impossible to mount a big musical today with only small investors.
Assuming that ``Swing,'' which opened to mixed reviews, builds an
audience, it will need 28 weeks to recoup its investment at 70
percent capacity _ or 21 weeks at 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most Broadway producers say the Baruch method is too cumbersome.
``When plays _ forget musicals _ cost $1 million to $2 million on
average, it becomes simply too much,'' Richenthal said. ``I find
producing hard enough without having to deal with a group of 50
investors. It would drive me bananas, and I think most of us feel
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Weissler, who with his wife, Fran, has produced Broadway
shows like ``Chicago'' and ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' said cobbling
together small increments takes too much time. ``If you're going to
do a production today, you have to move quickly,'' Weissler said.
``It doesn't allow you two years to raise your capital. Your
financing has to be in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Baruch acknowledges that his job has become more difficult over
the years. In 1985, it took 17 people to raise the $175,000 needed
to produce his first show, ``Penn and Teller,'' off-Broadway. Now,
with shows much more expensive, he has had to build a pool of 200
to 300 investors from which to draw.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Penn and Teller,'' Baruch's team made a name for itself
by producing classy off-Broadway shows like ``Frankie and Johnny in
the Clair de Lune'' and ``Love Letters.'' Then it tried its hand at
Broadway and, all told, has backed 35 shows in full or in part,
including the long-running ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' and a
shorter-lived show, the revival of ``The Sound of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of his investors, Baruch said, have stayed active because
they can afford to play around with $10,000 year after year.
``People would not commit suicide if we failed,'' Baruch said.
``And it isn't all that hard to find $10,000 players, given our
track record.''
</P>
<P>
   Benerofe said he made money investing in shows with Baruch like
``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``Love Letters.'' And although Benerofe
said, ``you go into each one with the idea of making a profit,'' he
added that ``the investments are modest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's not terribly serious if it makes it or it doesn't make
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To update investors on a show's progress, Baruch said, he
inundates them with paperwork _ including all the reviews (bad as
well as good), press clippings from all over the country and
statistics on financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Producers say investors look for strong track records. Because
of his past successes, Richenthal said he had three times as much
capital offered to him for ``Salesman'' as he needed. And it was
doubly easy to raise money for ``The Price,'' also by Arthur
Miller, which opened this season, because ``Salesman'' was such a
hit. Nevertheless, Richenthal said ``Death of a Salesman,'' which
starred Brian Dennehy as Willy Loman, cost him $2 million to
produce, compared with the $48,000 it cost originally in 1949. The
play closed at a profit after an extended, nine-month run.
</P>
<P>
   But large investors, producers say, can come with their own
baggage. They often want a credit in the program. Sometimes they
fancy themselves as part of the creative team and hold forth with
unsolicited notes on the show (which, producers say, they rarely
pass along to the creative team). And if a show fails, Richenthal
said, some investors will call to complain, ``Why didn't you take
out a bigger ad?'' or ``Why did you take out such a big ad?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can second-guess whatever you do, and they have a right
to,'' Richenthal said. ``That's why I would rather have a group of
fewer investors and pay proper attention to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Richenthal said he usually gathered 5 to 15 investors for a show
_ each of whom puts in a minimum of $25,000 _ and that he is the
only general partner in what he produces. ``I think there needs to
be one decision maker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' focus on getting credit can be distracting, he added.
``There are times when those of us who truly are there, stepping on
the grapes 12 hours a day, find the work we do seeming to be
diluted by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly as a result, producers have toyed with the idea of
trying to make themselves more independent of investors. Producers
say that the promise of a public company that is focused on
Broadway productions died last year, when Livent, the producer of
``Ragtime'' and other shows, declared bankruptcy and was later
acquired by SFX. They predicted that it would be a long time before
someone ventured down that road again.
</P>
<P>
   But Richenthal said he was considering identifying a few
specific projects over two or three seasons and raising money for
all of them at once _ the way a mutual fund gathers money to invest
in a portfolio of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   SFX Theatrical chairman and chief executive Miles Wilkin said
his company, along with Jujamcyn Theaters, is considering a similar
venture. ``We have discussed it earnestly over the last 12
months,'' Wilkin said. ``Not only researched it, but structured
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's stopping them? Wilkin said he and his colleagues would
``have to get comfortable with'' having enough projects in
production to make prospective investors feel secure. He likened it
to trusting your fund manager: ``You give up being able to pick
stocks for a predictable rate of return.''
</P>
<P>
   And is there ever such a thing as a predictable rate of return
in the unpredictable world of theater? ``You have to average out
those peaks and valleys,'' Wilkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, old habits die hard, producers say. And theater
investors are used to backing specific shows that interest them,
not simply putting their money and trust in producers.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Roth, who counts ``Wit'' among the many shows she has
produced, said people who support her off-Broadway shows ``have a
different investor mentality,'' less angel than savior. ``They tend
to think, `Gee, this is a good project, and if I don't help it
happen, it might not happen,''' Ms. Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ms. Roth, who has teamed up with the Baruch group
on several projects, said the multiple-investor approach was not
for her. ``It's tedious,'' Ms. Roth said. ``I give them credit for
being so tenacious.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that his strategy is labor intensive, Baruch
said it has kept him and his colleagues in business. ``When you're
dependent on big players, after a flop or two, you can lose them,''
he said. ``We always have people who will come back for more.''

THE INCREDIBLE DISAPPEARING UNLOVED LUXURY-CAR TAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 26)  
 (bl)  
 By WENDY WARREN KEEBLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If buying a Mercedes-Benz S500 or a Cadillac DeVille is on your
list of Y2K resolutions, Congress brings you New Year's cheer. When
the ball drops in Times Square, the luxury-tax rate will fall,
too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday, car buyers will pay a 5 percent tax _ down from
6 percent this year _ on the amount by which a vehicle's
transaction price exceeds $38,000.
</P>
<P>
   That $38,000 threshold is more good news: Since 1997, the
federal government has imposed the tax on vehicles costing $36,000
or more. Exceptions are vehicles with loaded weights of more than
6,000 pounds, including large sport utilities like the Cadillac
Escalade, Chevrolet Suburban, Lexus LX 470 and Lincoln Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the luxury tax on automobiles is being phased out on a
schedule that is to culminate in its demise on Jan. 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The changes for 2000 are being toasted by groups like the
American International Automobile Dealers Association, whose
members sell vehicles from foreign manufacturers. The group, which
accounts for a lot of luxury-car sales, has led an industry effort
to eliminate the tax, which took effect in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Even at lower rates, and even among wealthy buyers, the tax can
be a sticking point in negotiations, dealers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who have incomes that let them afford these cars
have those incomes because they're smart,'' said Walter Huizenga,
president of the dealers group. ``They're good negotiators. It's
not, `I can't afford that tax,' it's `I don't want to pay that
tax.'''
</P>
<P>
   So the tax's decline is good for buyers and sellers. ``It's a
tax that needs to go away, and it is going away,'' Huizenga said.

<P>
   These days, an automaker doesn't want to be caught offering a
dull, me-too product in the heart of the market. The $25,000 price
range is a predatory jungle inhabited by best sellers like the
Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, American favorites like the Ford
Taurus and Buick LeSabre and sporty imports like the BMW 323i and
Audi A4 _ not to mention a battalion of minivans, well-regarded
sedans like the Volkswagen Passat and Olds Intrigue and sporty
coupes like the Toyota Celica.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is also the Volvo S40, a compact sport sedan priced
just below $25,000 that is aimed at the young buyers who have long
eluded, or even ignored, Volvo. This will be a very tough market
for the Swedish company to crack. If things aren't crowded enough
now, Lexus and Jaguar have new small cars in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo, known for its extensive safety features, has generally
catered to older buyers (average age, 45) who didn't mind trading a
little flair in the styling department and a little sizzle under
the hood for big, boxy, even boring designs. Big, boxy and boring
aren't my words _ they rolled off the tongues of 20-to-35-year olds
when Volvo asked them to describe its cars.
</P>
<P>
   With the S40 sedan _ and a wagon version called the V40 _ Volvo
is trying to attract younger buyers with a few coins jangling in
their pockets. The auto marketers call this the ``entry-level
luxury market.'' In fact, it is a big-growth, high-profit business
where every luxury brand worthy of its burled wood inserts and
heated seats is trying to make a splash.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo wants buyers who are under 35 and don't mind the limits of
a smaller car, who want some European panache but might not have
the cash for an Audi, BMW or a Saab, all of which can easily barrel
through the $30,000 level.
</P>
<P>
   The S40 and the V40 are the latest in a string of new models
that Volvo has brought to the United States. By next fall, the
automaker _ which was bought by Ford this year _ will have
completed a three-year overhaul of its entire American lineup. Last
year, its most significant change was the S80, a new flagship sedan
with front-wheel drive and nary a square corner on its skin.
</P>
<P>
   The S40 echoes that look. With a nicely raked front end and a
swooping rear roofline, this curvy little Volvo is attractive. It
feels small inside, but the space is cleverly used. The rear seat
is surprisingly roomy, for instance, thanks to a design trick: The
rear seats are angled back more than usual to put extra space
between the front and rear passengers and increase the headroom.
</P>
<P>
   The S40 comes well-equipped, especially in comparison with the
hot-selling BMW 323i, a car with a starting price $4,000 higher. On
its base model, BMW skimps on touches that buyers have come to
expect: front and rear armrests cost extra, the visors do not have
lighted mirrors and the rear seat does not fold to add cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   The S40, which is built in the Netherlands in a joint venture
with Mitsubishi, comes with all those trimmings and more. While BMW
offers a powerful 2.5-liter six-cylinder engine, Volvo uses a
1.9-liter in-line four that is turbocharged and intercooled to perk
up acceleration. The engine certainly delivers reasonable pickup
and handling for a sport sedan, but it does not have the power
surge of BMW's six. Volvo has tried to reduce the lag time before
the turbo kicks in, but I still noticed a slight hesitation before
the car raced ahead.
</P>
<P>
   With its balanced suspension, precise steering and firm ride,
the BMW 3-Series has long served as the ride-and-handling benchmark
for sport sedans. Volvo cannot match BMW in that respect, but it
does not fall far off the mark. I did not feel as confident in the
S40 on parkway cloverleafs and twisting country roads as I did in
the BMW or, for that matter, in the Audi A4. The Swedes can still
learn something from the Germans about suspensions and handling.
</P>
<P>
   And Volvo might even consult its countrymen at Saab, whose 9-3
and 9-5 cars have the most impressive turbocharged four-cylinder
engines I have yet encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo does excel in safety features. If you want to feel safer,
you might consider an armored personnel carrier. There are two huge
air bags in the dashboard and two in the sides of each front seat
that provide extensive protection to heads and torsos. The
passenger compartment has been substantially reinforced, in case of
a rollover, and the side pillars and door beams were engineered to
absorb the brunt of the impact if the car is struck from the side.
</P>
<P>
   The headrests, though they don't offer much comfort in highway
cruising, are supposed to provide elaborate whiplash protection if
the car is struck from the rear.
</P>
<P>
   For all the focus on safety, however, the S40 does not have a
headrest in the center of the rear seat, something one finds on
less expensive European cars like the Volkswagen Jetta. The S40
does have a three-point belt for the middle rear passenger.
</P>
<P>
   There are also pockets in the backs of the front seats and small
side pockets in the rear doors. The rear seat is split in a 70-30
configuration, and both parts flip down to swallow cargo that the
trunk cannot contain. There was but one cup holder for the rear
passengers (and just one more up front), and the rear windows did
not fully retract.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest annoyance was the placement of the power window
buttons on the center console, next to the mirror controls. With
the armrest down, those buttons are difficult to reach. Time and
again as I approached a toll booth, I groped for the window buttons
and ended up moving the mirrors out of place or accidentally
lowering the passenger window. Volvo says it has heard similar
complaints and plans to redesign the center console on 2001 models.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Volvo was cozy but comfortable. The seats
delivered pleasant support and included adjustable lower-back
support. Wind noise was minimal. The four-speed automatic
transmission has three shift modes: sport, economy and winter. A
five-speed manual transmission is not available, but Volvo says it
is thinking of adding one. Sporting drivers can shift for
themselves with the A4, 323i and Infiniti G20.
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded field, the S40 certainly stood out for its safety
and for its value. Compared with the three cars I drove for
comparison's sake, the S40 was less expensive than the BMW and the
Audi and not much more than the G20. As for the curse of being big,
boxy and boring, Volvo has definitely overcome the first two. It is
making progress on the third.

BEHIND A THUD IN AN INTERNET STOCK PRICE

603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)

<P>
   When InterTrust Technologies Corp., went public Oct. 27 at $18 a
share, it was a model for a successful Internet start-up. A maker
of software used to manage the sale of digital content like music,
InterTrust has a clever business plan, strong partners and
respected management. The shares took off, closing at $187.25 on
Dec. 8, buoyed by positive analyst reports from three of the four
brokerage firms that underwrote the offering.
</P>
<P>
   All investors had to do was wait for the bump-up in the share
price when a fourth underwriter, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney,
issued its report on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a bombshell. On Dec. 15, Salomon issued its report. But
instead of serving up a buy rating, as underwriters almost
inevitably do when starting coverage of a stock they helped to
underwrite, Salomon gave the stock what it calls a 3S rating _ the
equivalent of a lowly ``hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold is precisely what shareholders did not do. They sold with a
vengeance, sending the stock down $33.375 in one day, to $121.6875,
a plunge of more than 20 percent. The stock now trades at
$124.8125.
</P>
<P>
   In the momentum-fueled world of Internet stocks, the event
offered a reminder of how investors can punish those that receive
anything less than exuberant plaudits. But it also offered insight
into how analysts deal with the challenge of valuing companies in
the evolving Internet market _ and the discomfort that some of them
have with the notion of using those valuations to determine their
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Zandi, the Salomon analyst who wrote the report, praised
the company's management, business model and potential to dominate
its market.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Zandi says InterTrust's net margins may eventually rival
those of Microsoft _ more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he says, his hold rating came down to his price
forecast. According to his calculations, InterTrust should be
trading at $170 a share in 12 months. Since the company was already
trading at $155 at the time of the report, he concluded that it was
already ``valued to the vision.''
</P>
<P>
   To arrive at his target price, Zandi estimated InterTrust's
future market, prices, margins and eventual growth rate, and
discounted the resulting earnings. Even a tiny change in one of the
estimates could have had a huge effect on his price target.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, valuing early-stage companies like InterTrust is, in the
words of one analyst, ``more art than science.'' And that is one
reason that the other, bullish analysts disagreed with Zandi.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Todd Raker, an analyst at Credit Suisse First
Boston, Intertrust's lead underwriter, said he had moved away from
assigning target prices to early-stage companies because of the
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing a pure valuation call on early-market stocks is a very
difficult task to achieve with any level of confidence,'' he said.
``I think what investors should be focused on is finding very
attractive business models that generate a lot of cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Raker uses discounted cash flow analysis in his reports. But
rather than coming up with hard numbers, he computes upper and
lower limits on variables like market size and then comes up with a
range of possible values for the stock. He estimates that
InterTrust is worth from $58 to $200 a share _ an exceedingly wide
range.
</P>
<P>
   He says his current rating, a strong buy, is justified because
he believes his analysis to be conservative and because the stock
is trading within his range. In another report, Raimundo Archibold,
an analyst at J.P. Morgan, another underwriter, calculated a
relative valuation for InterTrust. He took a class of similar
companies, looking at their revenue multiples and long-term growth
rates. That showed InterTrust shares could hit $214 in the near
term and $562 in the next 12 months _ although he does not
characterize those numbers as official price targets.
</P>
<P>
   (The fourth underwriter, Soundview Technology, called price
forecasts ``a challenge'' but nevertheless cited a price target of
$250.)
</P>
<P>
   Zandi said he had no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I hear from people who wring their hands at these
valuations is that it's ludicrous,'' he said. ``But you have to do
it _ you have to decide whether to buy and sell these things.'' He
added that Salomon requires its analysts to assign price targets to
stocks they cover.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors who are focused on the Internet are throwing up
their hands at nebulous valuations. Peter Doyle, a co-manager of
the Internet Fund, said he and his staff did their own research.
``We don't really use Wall Street research in any measurable way,
he said, ``because the research tends to be very subjective.''

WHERE (ONLY) THE TALL CORN GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 26, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the flap last fall about Edmund Morris' biography of
Ronald Reagan? Morris invented a fictional first-person narrator in
order to make more readable his ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald
Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   The book has sold briskly, according to Random House: well
enough, but not nearly as well as it might have if it hadn't been
savaged by most historians, journalists, and every self-interested
interpreter of Reagan's reputation on the political landscape. It
has fallen off the best-sellers lists.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked in the fracas was the story of another biography of a
Republican president. George Nash's life of Herbert Hoover took the
opposite tack from that of Morris: scrupulous, lengthy, objective,
scholarly.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's reward was to have the plug pulled on his project halfway
through by his backers, who complained of the cost and the length
of the project.
</P>
<P>
   With three volumes down, and another four or five to go, the
story was beginning to get really interesting. ``The Engineer
1874-1914,'' ``The Humanitarian 1914-1917,'' and ``The Master of
Emergencies 1917-1918'' had been published, heavily subsidized by
their sponsors, the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Another thousand pages had been written on the year 1919 alone,
during which Hoover served as a kind of one-man Marshall Plan in
charge of US aid to Europe and Russia at the end of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Next would come his years as Secretary of Commerce under Warren
Harding and Calvin Coolidge, his single term as president during
the years in which the Great Depression settled over the industrial
world like an unnatural winter, then the long period of
post-presidential influence among conservatives around the world.
Hoover died in 1964, the year Barry Goldwater was the Republican
nominee for President.
</P>
<P>
   Nash even took a year off to write a monograph on Hoover and
Stanford University. The Quaker-raised youth was a freshman there
when the fledgling university opened its doors in 1891, Nash points
out. He's still there in spirit, in the form of the Hoover
Institution for War, Peace and Revolution, a peculiar research
institute whose great stone tower dominates the leafy campus.
</P>
<P>
   It was all too much for the Iowa businesspersons and Hoover
friends and family members on the board of the Library Association
in the cheerful little farming community of West Branch, Iowa,
where Hoover had been born. By the mid '90s, they were running out
of the money they had to keep Nash writing.
</P>
<P>
   They were reluctant to raise more, impatient to see the end of
the saga, unwilling or unable to find some other GOP moneybags to
take over the project. The president's grandson, Herbert Hoover
III, known as Pete, turned 71 this year. Nash's 80-year-old mother
joked that her son wouldn't finish the project in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1995, after nearly 20 years of supporting the biographer,
the Library Association gave Nash his walking papers. A committee
headed by former Senator Mark Hatfield (R-Oregon) parceled out
assignments for the three remaining volumes of the original plan to
university-based Hoover experts. And George Nash, whose very visage
had come to resemble that of his subject as closely as if he had
been Hoover's son, put down what he thought had been his life's
work and started casting about for another task.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the following question: if the community that
howled at Edmund Morris for the liberties he took popularizing the
Ronald Reagan story cannot support a single superb scholar doing
the definitive life of the other great Republican innovator of the
20th century, just how sturdy are the intellectual underpinnings of
the current wave of conservatism, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   (What about Theodore Roosevelt, president from 1901 until 1909?
He's probably best understood as belonging to the ``long'' 19th
century. Dwight D. Eisenhower was more an interpreter of traditions
pioneered by the Democrats than a GOP original.)
</P>
<P>
   Nash was a freshly-minted Harvard PhD in intellectual history
when he answered an ad from the friends of the Hoover Library in
1974. They were seeking a historian to make use of newly-opened
material at the presidential archive in West Branch, Iowa, not far
from Iowa City. It was a bad year for 20th-century American
historians in the job market. Nash wasn't anxious to leave the
Connecticut River valley where he had been raised (South Hadley,
Mass.) and educated (Amherst College.)
</P>
<P>
   Nash's first book, ``The Conservative Intellectual Movement in
America Since 1945,'' was nearly complete. (It appeared in 1976.)
So rather than sign on as a teacher in a university where he did
not want to be, Nash agreed to write a six-volume life of Hoover,
the contract extending into the mid-1990s. He became an independent
scholar.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the United States was just entering its Turn to
the Right _ then, as now, very little understood. Nash's book
fairly quickly was recognized as a work of profound historical
imagination _ a thorough examination of the intellectual roots of a
phenomenon that had been dismissed nearly univerally in
universities as irrelevant only a few years before.
</P>
<P>
   Here was not just William F. Buckley, the conservative whom
everybody already knew, but Ludwig von Mises, Richard Weaver, Leo
Strauss, Friederich Hayek, Eric Vogelin, Willmore Kendall, Peter
Viereck, Russell Kirk, and a raft of other serious thinkers who
labored far from the media spotlight in the years before the
conservative resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the time Ronald Reagan was in the White House, Nash had
shunned the heavily-endowed policy ``think-tanks'' that swept to
prominence with the Republicans in order to spend much of each year
at the presidential library in West Branch. In Hoover's lifetime,
busloads of schoolchildren had been delivered annually to the
presidential homestead, there to sing the state song to the Great
Man (``Iowa! Iowa! That's where the tall corn grows. . .). Now 60
years later a trio of Harvard historians (Richard Norton Smith,
Steven Kesselman, and Nash) labored over his papers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Cato Institute libertarians, American Enterprise
Institute ``paleo-conservatives,'' Hudson Institute
``supply-siders'' spent money like water. Nash bore down in Iowa on
topics as remote from the present day as Hoover's experiences as a
mining engineer and his adventures as a young husband in Beijing
during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. It was an act of seeming
self-abnegation of astonishing proportions.
</P>
<P>
   As the years rolled on, however _ as Reagan gave way to George
Bush, who in turn was upset after a single term by Bill Clinton on
the strength of a short and mild recession; after Ross Perot, Pat
Buchanan, and Steve Forbes launched an angry revolt _ the Hoover
biography project began to take on significance and charm.
</P>
<P>
   What, after all, were the roots of the man Joan Hoff Wilson had
called ``the forgotten progressive?'' How did Hoover cope with the
strains within the Republican party between cosmopolitan
corporatists and populist isolationists, beginning in the 1920s?
What was the effect on ``liberal Republicanism'' of his eclipse?
</P>
<P>
   It is a truism that each generation must rewrite history in the
light of its own experience. In this sense Nash was the
indispensible historian of the generation of the 1960s _ well into
the task of reinterpreting intellectual experiences that had been
distorted, inevitably, by triumphalist interpretations of Franklin
Roosevelt's New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Tt was, alas, too good to be true. Arthur S. Link's life-long
preoccupation with Woodrow Wilson (60-odd volumes of edited
papers!); Dumas Malone's six-volume life of Thomas Jefferson; John
Simon's laborious attention to the career of Ulysses S. Grant: all
magnificent obsessions supported by day jobs in universities. The
Hoover Library Association shared no such lofty motives. No other
sponsor could be found. And unlike the Edmund Morris episode,
hardly anyone in the vast conservative opinion-making apparatus
breathed a word.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nash is looking for another commission. Perhaps a full
length sequel to ``The Conservative Intellectual Movement in
America Since 1945?'' ``That is one of the ideas I have been
considering,'' says the historian. At least that book is back in
print, in a handsome 1996 edition, thanks to the Intercollegiate
Studies Institute in Wilmington, Del. Too bad a similarly generous
sponsor couldn't have been found for the rest of the Hoover
project.

PITINO EAGER FOR TEAM TO LIVE UP TO PLAYOFF PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was a year unlike any other in the history of the
NBA. A lockout precipitated by the owners' concerns over escalating
costs threatend to wipe out the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, regular-season games were canceled. The
All-Star Game was canceled. The whole season was within 48 hours of
being wiped out when an agreement was reached in early January.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a season of 50 games in 90 days. Training camps
were limited to two weeks. Players were out of shape, out of sorts,
or both. Coaches scrambled to fill rosters and game plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was the least fun coaching that I've had in my
entire coaching career,'' Rick Pitino said. ``There was no time to
teach. Everything was rushed. It was a total nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two schools of thought as to which teams would
benefit once the shortened season began. Some figured veteran teams
would prosper. Some figured that younger teams, like the Celtics,
would have the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino had a reason for not liking the season. His team didn't
win and it was fractured by in-fighting. Players argued on the
floor. Pitino made yet another trade involving a key player. A
rookie turned out to be the team's most complete player.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were still in the thick of things after a 6-5
February. But they lost 12 of their first 14 in the month of March
to fall out of contention. During that swoon, Pitino basically
punted on the season and said he already was looking forward to
next season. He also guaranteed the team would make the playoffs in
1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't sit well with anyone. For the first time, Pitino and
his team heard boos in the FleetCenter. Fans derisively called for
M.L. Carr to come back. Antoine Walker was regularly jeered for
missing shots, even if they were good shots. The team would win
only 10 of 25 games at home and finish the season 19-31, well out
of the playoffs for the fourth straight year.

SKATING THE LONG PATH OF REBUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The rebuilding process isn't finished by any means, but
the Bruins in 1999 finally won a playoff round, knocking off the
Carolina Hurricanes (nee Hartford Whalers) in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by Byron Dafoe's steady netminding, including shutouts in
Games 1 and 6 of their first-round playoff series last April, and
helped by the emergence of young forwards Joe Thornton, Jason
Allison, Anson Carter, and Sergei Samsonov, the Bruins were shaping
up as true contenders in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, they met up with the Buffalo Sabres in Round 2.
Baffled by Buffalo's strong checking, especially the line of
Michael Peca-Dixon Ward-Vaclav Varada, the Bruins could generate
little offense after winning the opening game of the series. They
lost the next three, by a collective score of 9-3, and eventually
were dismissed in a sixth game at Buffalo, their offense just too
shallow and unproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it was the best hockey year in the Hub since 1994, the
season the Bruins knocked off the Canadiens in Round 1 before being
rubbed out by New Jersey in Round 2. After first-round flops in '95
(New Jersey) and '96 (Florida), failing to qualify in '97, and then
getting dismissed in Round 1 again in '98 (Washington), the
franchise finally appeared to have established a young core of
talent that could be the nucleus of a winning team for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   The offseason brought its usual amount of contract-related
tension. After all, what's summer in Boston without the usual
harangues and holdups when players engage in financial arm
wrestling with Messrs. Harry Sinden and Mike O'Connell?
</P>
<P>
   When the smoke cleared this time, reliable center Tim Taylor had
moved on to the Rangers as a free agent; defenseman Dave Ellett and
forward Ken Baumgartner had their contracts bought out; and _
setting an NHL precedent _ the Bruins had walked away from the $2.8
million salary Dmitri Khristich was awarded in arbitration,
ultimately dealing his rights to Toronto for a second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999-2000 season got off to a rocky start, with No. 1
netminder Byron Dafoe holding out in a contract dispute. The Bruins
opened with a nine-game winless stretch (0-5-4), the Black and
Gold's worst start in 35 years. A month into his holdout, Dafoe
signed a three-year pact worth $9.45 million, less the month's pay
he forfeited while haggling.
</P>
<P>
   As the calendar year draws to a close, Pat Burns's bunch is
attempting to recapture the stride and emotion that was there in
the spring. Still without a Stanley Cup since 1972, their fan base
still incredibly loyal, the Bruins need to add some reliable
scoring if they're going to make a real run for it come April.

THE YEAR OF PEDRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It will be remembered as ``El Ano del Pedro,'' a fin de
siecle performance by Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez that took its
place among the greatest by any Sox pitcher while challenging the
best of any modern-day pitcher, including Hall of Famers Sandy
Koufax and Bob Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez won 23 games while losing just four, and his earned run
average of 2.40 was less than half of the league average (4.86).
Martinez also struck out a league-leading 313 batters while walking
just 37, and entered the realm of legend when, in the deciding game
of the AL division series against the Cleveland Indians, pitched
six hitless innings of relief despite a strained muscle in the back
of his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, despite the loss of free agent Mo Vaughn, won 94 games
and became the first Sox team since World War I to go to the
postseason in consecutive seasons. For this achievement, Jimy
Williams was named the American League's Manager of the Year, as he
overcame a season-shortening injury to closer Tom Gordon and three
trips to the DL by starter Bret Saberhagen to guide the Sox to the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who had not won a postseason series since 1986, staged
an improbable comeback from a two-games-to-none deficit to win the
AL division series against the Indians, outslugging the major
leagues' highest-scoring team in the final two games.
</P>
<P>
   In a year in which they hosted what many have called the most
memorable All-Star experience ever _ including an epic showing by
Mark McGwire in the home run derby and a heart-tugging salute to
Hall of Famer Ted Williams in a pregame ceremony _ the Sox finished
the year by meeting the Yankees for the first time ever in a
postseason series. The Yankees won their AL Championship Series,
four games to one, but not before the Sox humiliated their former
ace, Roger Clemens, in a matchup against Martinez that was promoted
like a heavyweight title bout.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dan Duquette, who endured withering criticism
after Vaughn's departure, was vindicated by the performance of
newcomers Jose Offerman, who hit .429 in the postseason as the Red
Sox leadoff man, and Brian Daubach, a minor-league journeyman who
inherited Vaughn's role as lefthanded slugger and hit 21 home runs.
Catcher Jason Varitek had a breakthrough season, and Derek Lowe
became one of the league's best relievers, making their acquisition
from Seattle two years before one of Duquette's finest hours. And
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, Duquette's first draft pick after he
was hired by Boston in 1994, won the AL batting crown with a .357
average.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1900s ended with the Red Sox going 81 years without a
World Series title, and 2000 begins with plans for the construction
of a new Fenway Park.

   At Least E-Tailing Works in High Places
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton, for the first time, shopped online this
holiday season. Not surprisingly, he hasn't reported the delivery
problems that some constituents have had.
</P>
<P>
   From his antique wooden desk in the Oval Office, using a Compaq
laptop, the president ordered gifts last Monday from two Web sites,
said Nanda Chitre, a White House spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   He bought horsehair bracelets from a Web site,
www.lakotafund.org, that benefits the Oglala Lakota Nation in South
Dakota. And he bought a book, ``Children from Australia to
Zimbabwe,'' which invites children to experience what it is like to
grow up in other countries, from www.world2market.com.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts were sent to the White House, Ms. Chitre said, using
the special ZIP code that routes mail to the presidential
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Washington, Vice President Al Gore (who once
claimed to be the father of the Internet) also bought gifts online
this holiday season. But a spokesman declined to disclose details,
saying that Gore did not want to look as if he were endorsing
specific sites.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, shopped the
old-fashioned way this year, according to a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Help With That Perfect Gift  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even deep-pocketed executives stumble in buying the right
Christmas gift for their spouses. Al Piergallini, head of worldwide
consumer health at Novartis in Summit, N.J., acknowledges having
even more trouble than most. ``I always try to to find out what my
wife really wants,'' he said, ``but it is very difficult for me to
buy Christmas presents for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this year. On a recent trip to Fortunoff, Piergallini's
wife, Lorraine, spotted a piece of antique silver and asked him to
flip open his wallet. Piergallini obliged, but he still is not sure
what he bought. ``It's hard to say about those antique silver
pieces,'' he said. ``It goes in that category as the silver stuff
you put in your dining room.''
</P>
<P>
   Going Home, After the Holidays  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch,
hasn't been wild about American stocks lately, but he is bullish on
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Clough, 57, was living and working in the Boston area when
Merrill hired him 14 years ago. He still lives there, commuting to
Merrill's Manhattan headquarters almost every week. Soon, he will
be back in Boston full time _ well, as soon as Merrill decides who
will succeed him. It may take two people.
</P>
<P>
   People at Merrill say David Bowers, the firm's European
strategist in London is in line for the job _ at least the global
part. Bowers, who is British, said decisions would be made after
the holidays. But, he added, ``I'd be very surprised if the U.S.
equity strategy was run by anybody other than an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoting Bowers would reflect Merrill's move from a domestic
firm to a global one. ``The function changed a lot while I was
here,'' Clough said. In recent years, he has spent much time
studying foreign financial markets (racking up more than 3 million
miles on airplanes). He is very proud of his call last year urging
investors to put more money into Japanese securities, which paid
off handsomely. Indeed, he remains bullish on overseas markets,
predicting they will beat the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
next year. His bearish views on domestic investing have been more
controversial, especially among the firm's 14,000 brokers. But
Merrill officials say Clough's departure is unrelated to that
stance.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Merrill, he will set up shop managing money for
charitable foundations and some wealthy families. And he will spend
more time on his other calling. He is a deacon in the Roman
Catholic Church, authorized to marry and baptize people. And, of
course, he helps the Archdiocese of Boston manage its money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keeping an Eye on a Rival?
</P>
<P>
   The competition in Brazil's Internet industry is getting really
heated, thanks to Bob Wollheim, president of the Brazilian
subsidiary of StarMedia Network, the New York-based Internet
company that focuses on Latin America. He recently rented the side
of an apartment building near the Sao Paulo headquarters of its
largest rival, Universo Online, for a monster billboard of
StarMedia's logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when those guys stand up from their desks to look out the
window, they'll be reminded of the competition,'' Wollheim said,
chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Caio Tulio Costa, UOL's managing director, was not amused.
``It's a waste of their investors' money,'' he said.

PATS PASS ON PLAYOFFS AFTER SECOND-HALF COLLAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ After a first-round playoff loss to
Jacksonville, the Patriots front office conducted a two-week
evaluation period and backstair interviews with players before
announcing that Pete Carroll was still the coach. Almost a year
later, the same topic is the hot issue after the Patriots tumbled
to 7-7 and out of the playoffs for the first time since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But, then, they should have known this wasn't going to be their
year when Robert Edwards, who rushed for 1,115 yards in '98 as
Curtis Martin's rookie replacement, suffered a potential
career-ending knee injury in a beach flag football game during Pro
Bowl weekend at Honolulu last February. The lack of a running game
has often been blamed for their recent stumble.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also continued to feel the bite of the salary cap,
having to let center Dave Wohlabaugh, linebacker Todd Collins,
punter/backup quarterback Tom Tupa, and safety Willie Clay walk
away. But on the flip side they inked cornerback Ty Law to the
richest contract ever given a Patriot, a seven-year, $50 million
deal complete with a $14.2 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   In April, they went to the draft and came away with better
players than they had the previous two seasons under Bobby Grier's
watch, taking Damien Woody with the 17th pick overall _ a must pick
(after losing Wohlabaugh) who showed promise in the middle of the
beleaguered offensive line. Five slots later, they tabbed colorful
Ohio State linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, who stepped right into the
starting lineup when starting middle linebacker suffered a biceps
injury for the second straight year and missed most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally took the field in September amid predictions
that they were a fourth-place team, the Patriots surprised everyone
by jumping off to a 4-0 start _ including an opening-day,
last-minute win over the hated Jets. New England was sitting pretty
at 6-2 going into the bye week, Drew Bledsoe enjoying an MVP-like
season. But then it all fell apart. Suddenly, defenses were all
over Bledsoe, who threw just five touchdown passes and 16
interceptions in the next six games as the team fell to 7-7 and
fourth place, leaving Carroll and more than a few others on shaky
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The season had plenty of distractions. Wide receiver Vincent
Brisby complained about not being active for the first few games,
and perennial Pro Bowl tight end Ben Coates was angered when he
went without a catch in a 27-3 win over Arizona Oct. 31 and asked
out if the Patriots weren't going to use him. Second-year tight end
Rod Rutledge was involved in a late-night, high-speed automobile
accident returning from a Providence strip club, and Lawyer Milloy
and Brisby got into a fight _ during a benefit for the Big Brothers
and Boys Clubs at a Saugus nightclub _ that spilled over into a
team meeting on Thanksgiving Day. That same morning, Terry Glenn
was late for the team meeting after being caught speeding through
Walpole, and later he was hit with a civil suit stemming from an
alleged incident with a woman after that Saugus function.
</P>
<P>
   But with a new stadium on the horizon after the Massachusetts
legislature finally approved infrastructure funds and the town of
Foxborough approved zoning, the Patriots are hoping to find better
days ahead. They just don't know who'll be leading them there.

ABBY JOSEPH COHEN STILL BULLISH, BUT PULLING IN THE HORNS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Abby Joseph Cohen puts it, she has been ``jumping up and
down'' since the early 1990s, telling clients across America that
the stock market had plenty of room to grow, even when other
strategists said the opposite was true.
</P>
<P>
   Using conservative and well-researched earnings estimates and
factoring in the economy's low-inflation environment, Ms. Cohen,
the diva of this bull market, has argued in her measured way that
the stock market's undervaluation was a reason to expect good
returns from equities.
</P>
<P>
   Well, she's not jumping up and down any more. In her 2000
forecast, Ms. Cohen, market strategist at Goldman Sachs, said the
stock market is fairly valued. In an interview last week, she said
the market has been fairly valued since March.
</P>
<P>
   She is emphasizing this point now, she said, because ``this is
the first time we have spent any length of time at fair value in
this bull run.'' Then she added: ``We no longer think the market is
cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a big change. It means, she said, that price
appreciation will move back to its historical trend, that is, high
single-digit annual increases in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index.
</P>
<P>
   That pace would be a lot slower than investors are used to. In
1999, for the fifth consecutive year, the S&AMP;P 500, as well as the
market's two other marquee indexes _ the Dow Jones industrial
average and the NASDAQ composite _ are heading for double-digit
returns.
</P>
<P>
   So why haven't alarm bells been ringing since she issued her
report Dec. 16? It is possible that many investors have ignored
this warning because her market forecasts have always been
understated. While she has been correct about the market _ and has
not buckled during sharp downturns during 1997 and 1998 _ her
forecasts for the gains in the S&AMP;P 500 and the Dow have been short
of actual performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen says she does that on purpose. ``I am trying to come
up with a forecast that is not on the extreme end of the bell
curve,'' she said. ``I want a forecast that we are comfortable with
achieving.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the understated nature of her forecasts, the themes
she lays out each year assume added importance. And, until now,
they have remained pretty constant.
</P>
<P>
   She often reminds investors, for example, that market advances
follow a staircase pattern _ spurts followed by trading ranges.
That theme should be even more relevant in a market with slower
growth. Her ``Supertanker America'' theme, which argues that global
crises will not derail the United States economy, still holds true.
The same goes for the ``Silly Putty'' theme, which has claimed for
years that the profit and economic expansion will stretch much
longer than anyone expects. The need for nimble stock-picking,
another theme, is even more important in a market where 67 percent
of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange are 20 percent or more
below their 52-week highs.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the first change in one of her major themes since she
became a bull in early 1991. Ms. Cohen argued for years that the
stock market could live with higher price-to-earnings ratios when
inflation was low. Lower inflation, she has said, increases
investor confidence in the growth of profits and makes them willing
to pay more for a given level of earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But now, she noted, inflation is beginning to rise modestly.
That means ``inflation is no longer going down and it is no longer
something that gives us a significant margin for improvement in
valuations,'' she said. That, she explained, is a reason for
believing that the market will stay fairly valued.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that Ms. Cohen is pessimistic. The market,
she says, will hit new highs in 2000, with operating earnings for
the S&AMP;P 500 rising 8 percent. And the earnings will be more solid
than the percentage increase implies because the second half of
2000 will have to be compared with a very strong second half of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Cohen's market forecast, which she says provides
direction, not precision, she puts the S&AMP;P 500 at 1,525 and the Dow
at 12,300 at the end of next year. Those are jumps of 4.6 percent
and 7.8 percent, respectively, from the levels Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen is favoring financial stocks, including banks and
insurance companies, in part because they fell so sharply this year
that she thinks they are good values. ``You are buying a financial
services growth stock at a 40 percent discount to the market,'' she
said. And technology stocks are still on her list, although she
thinks the ``valuations are not as appealing as they were.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threat Ms. Cohen sees is the politics of a
presidential election year, a factor that many strategists have not
even mentioned in their musings about 2000. ``Directional changes
could be problematic,'' she wrote in her outlook analysis. ``For
example, federal budget policy has been moving toward restraint
since 1992; proposals for excessive tax cuts or spending programs
could be worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   She dismisses the risk of a surge in inflation and says Year
2000 computer problems will be few. She does not think that
economic recovery and stock-market rallies abroad will siphon off
investors from the U.S. market. Indeed, Ms. Cohen said global
growth would help the profits of American multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   And she says the stock market will weather the rate increases
that she and most other analysts expect the Federal Reserve to make
early next year if the economic growth refuses to slow from the
torrid 5 percent annual pace of the last six months. ``This is
something that will not come as a surprise,'' she said. ``It is
already a built-in presumption.''
</P>
<P>
   So the shock for investors, if Ms. Cohen is right about market
valuations, is that normal returns next year will look puny
compared with the last five, robust years.

DALLAS' DEEP ELLUM: REVITALIZED, FOR WORK AND PLAY

   DALLAS _ In 1986, when Brady Wood came here as a teen-ager from
New Orleans, he thought something was missing in the city _ like a
soul. ``This place was a great cultural void,'' he said. ``Too
clean, too much glass and steel.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Wood, now 32, says Dallas finally has ``a place
that's cool'': the Deep Ellum neighborhood, just across the Central
Expressway from downtown. And he had a hand in transforming it.
</P>
<P>
   Once a jumble of half-abandoned industrial buildings and the
site of the city's largest homeless encampment, Deep Ellum is now a
magnet for young professionals, stylish stores and the city's
growing Internet industry. It has a proliferation of retail
businesses selling most everything from trendy furniture to
tattoos, and dozens of places to eat, drink, dance and socialize.
``This neighborhood,'' said Wood, who owns two nightspots and two
restaurants in the district, ``could be the next Melrose or Soho.''
</P>
<P>
   There is more to the comparison than a developer's enthusiasm.
The evolution of Deep Ellum into a thriving entertainment and
creative business center reflects a broader national trend. Growing
populations of single people, young couples without children and,
more recently, empty nesters are recolonizing near-downtown
districts in New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and other
cities, and creative businesses like design studios, ad agencies
and Internet start-ups are following them in.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, Deep Ellum provides noteworthy evidence
that the same dynamic is at work in a new category of cities, like
Dallas, that did most of their growing after World War II and never
before possessed neighborhoods that many people would call hip.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, the emergence of Deep Ellum started with two
ingredients: cheap rents and old buildings. In its first heyday in
the 1930s, Deep Ellum was a center for African-American
entertainment, but by the 1980s it had withered to a handful of
restaurants and bars and little else. One of the rare parts of this
thoroughly modern city untouched by large-scale redevelopment, Deep
Ellum had blocks of old warehouses and factories ideal for
conversion into artists' lofts.
</P>
<P>
   When a few art galleries and nightclubs moved in, attracted by
the cheap rents, real estate investors like Wood and Don Blanton
saw possibilities. ``I did a lot of traveling in the country, and
Dallas didn't have anything like that for people,'' said Blanton,
who now owns 35 buildings in Deep Ellum. ``We had no Greenwich
Village or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly two decades for the vision to become reality, but
the rewards have been great for the pioneer investors. Buildings
that changed hands in the 1980s at $5 a square foot now attract
offers in the range of $100 a square foot. Yet Blanton, a West
Texas native who lives and works in Deep Ellum _ his spacious loft
is a short walk from his office on Commerce Street _ thinks it is
not yet time to sell. In fact, he is looking for more properties in
the district.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone: corporate real estate interests are appearing
on the scene. A major developer, Joseph Beard of Westdale Asset
Management, plans to refurbish an old building at the western edge
of Deep Ellum as part of a $90 million hotel-retail complex.
</P>
<P>
   Beard, whose firm specializes in condominiums and apartment
complexes, is impressed by the return of a residential population
to the district. According to Barry Annino, 42, a longtime local
real estate agent, the number of apartment and loft dwellers in
Deep Ellum has risen to more than 2,000, from 200 a decade ago. And
based on projects already announced, Beard estimated that the
number would more than triple again in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   With the new residents has come a surge in interest from
Internet businesses. In the past, Dallas' technology companies
tended to cluster in suburbs like Richardson and Plano, but Deep
Ellum is rapidly becoming a preferred home for dot-com concerns
like Broadcast.com (now part of Yahoo), which announced a move into
an 80,000-square-foot warehouse, with 700 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Annino, a former tennis pro from Queens who came to Dallas in
1985, leased Broadcast.com its first 3,000-square-foot building
here five years ago. Regarded as the unofficial mayor of the
neighborhood, Annino sees Yahoo's decision to keep the company in
Deep Ellum as validation of the district's emergence as a prime
location for Internet businesses. Many smaller companies that have
leased space there, he said, have told him that they were attracted
by the new ambience of the district, in much the same way as their
analogues have been drawn to Tribeca in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This location is perfect for a business like mine,'' said
Brett Strauss, 33, the president of Third Stone, an eight-person
Web design studio on Canton Street that counts Broadcast.com among
its customers. ``You have to be near the heart of things, near the
talent pool. This is young industry and this is a young part of
town.''
</P>
<P>
   In many eyes, one cloud hangs over Deep Ellum's future.
Experience elsewhere teaches that a neighborhood that is newly
fashionable is also newly vulnerable: Longtime residents like Brady
Wood worry that the boom times that are following Deep Ellum's
so-called discovery will wind up obliterating the character of the
place that has made it so attractive.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Soho first gained cachet as an artists' haven, but
rising rents have driven many of the artists away even as galleries
and restaurants have thrived. If not monitored carefully, Wood
said, the same dynamic could play out in Deep Ellum, snuffing out
the neighborhood's spontaneity as its one-of-a-kind shops are
overwhelmed by national chains and as local bohemians are
supplanted by well-turned-out young lawyers and stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this neighborhood,'' he said over coffee at Cafe
Brazil, a local late-night hangout. ``It's a great place to work,
and it keeps me in Dallas. But if it lost its character and became
like everywhere else here, I'd have to go back to New Orleans.''

<P>
   MILLENNIUM-TIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ This New Year's Eve feels
different, no matter how arbitrary the date announcing the new
millennium may be. But the big round number about to invade our
lives has an undeniable symbolic force. Is this mere superstition?
Perhaps not entirely, for while our systems for measuring time may
be arbitrary, they are also necessary. We live suspended in
infinite time and space. But humans are mortal and finite, and we
need borders and markers to grasp the world in our minds. By Eva
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   EXCESS-REVIEW (Undated) _ There is so much money sloshing around
that it seems to have overwhelmed the last vestiges of Puritan
guilt over spending it. As the stock market and corporate profits
continue to rise, charities nationwide report that donations from
both individuals and companies are donating have fallen this year.
The very idea of wretched excess, of buying as vulgar and wealth as
morally dangerous, has given way to a display-and-play ethos. By
Monique P. Yazigi.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inside the section:
</P>
<P>
   ENUFF-EHYPE-REVIEW (Undated) _ E-nuff already. It is the surest
sign that the Internet is totally mainstream: Everyone is tired of
it, not just the sleep-starved workers at dot-com startups, but
everyone _ man and beast alike. Turn on the television and you are
assaulted by an endless parade of jabbering advertisements for
e-commerce companies. Newspapers are so bloated these days with ads
for dot-com marketers that dogs across the nation must be loosening
their teeth and straining their necks to fetch them. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   GAY-MARRIAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Vermont Supreme Court seemed
to drop a bombshell last week when it ruled that gay couples must
either be allowed to marry or get the same benefits as heterosexual
couples. As gay rights advocates and their opponents squared off
over the decision, some of them agreed that the real battleground
will take place not in legal courtrooms but in the court of public
opinion. By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-DEBATES-ADS-REVIEW (Des Moines) _ Vice President Gore's
proposal to scrap all 30-second television spots in favor of
twice-weekly debates with former Sen. Bill Bradley is an indirect
approach to a spending curb. It would forswear the most costly way
to spend campaign cash: the 30-second TV ads, whose price rises
sharply each election cycle. If nobody bought 30-second spots
praising or condemning candidates like competing brands of laundry
detergent, campaign costs would drop dramatically _ and the level
of political discourse might rise. But nobody expects that to
happen. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   MENTAL-HEALTH-REVIEW (New York) _ Public policy on treating
mental illness often gets made in strange, circuitous ways.
Ultimately it is the states, not the federal government, that are
responsible for providing funding and treatment. In New York, major
changes are in the works come courtesy not of the president nor the
surgeon general, but thanks to one schizophrenic who pushed a woman
into the path of a subway train. By Michael Winerip.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-U.S. (United Nations) _ The Clinton administration has
finally retreated from a policy of making the United Nations the
focal point of policy on Iraq _ and, indeed, from making Iraq a
focal point of policy. Now fixed on the glittering prize of a
broader Middle East peace among Israel and its neighbors, the
administration has let Iraq slip into the middle distance, where it
is likely to remain for the last year of the Clinton era unless
President Saddam Hussein does something very foolish and
provocative. By Barbara Crossette. (Moving in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   NEWYEAR-WARNINGS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The air is filled with
apocalyptic warnings tied to the turn of the millennium. But there
is plenty more to worry about than serious threats like terrorism,
doomsday cults and Y2K calamities. A sampling of alarming bulletins
culled from recent press releases and news reports.

SEEING THE STRANGEST NUMBER FROM 2 SIDES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of story.) 
(DW) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the millennium gasps its last tired breath, a final
tribute must be paid to something overlooked. It might seem to be
nothing, yet during the last 1,000 years it has transformed
physics, mathematics, commerce and the shape of Western
civilization. That something is nothing.
</P>
<P>
   That nothing is marked by something. Pardon the cryptic
formulations, but the object in question is the number zero. Zero,
whose presence declares absence, is a cipher in more ways than one
_ or maybe in more ways than none. Even our word for ``cipher''
seems to have its origins in the Sanskrit word sunya, which means
void. The word may have then been passed to Arabic as sifr and
branched off in one direction toward cipher and in Italy turning
into zeiro, zefor and zevero _ sources of our zero.
</P>
<P>
   It is only in the past millennium that this number has come into
its own, making Western mathematics and science possible. What a
strange number it is! It is never used to count any real objects;
it is a conceptual invention. Whitehead called it ``the most
civilized of the cardinals'' because it is only needed for
``cultivated modes of thought.'' So it has seemed: it inspired the
calculus, spurred explorations of the infinite and now holds court
in contemporary physics' most baroque theories.
</P>
<P>
   It has also just inspired two books: Robert Kaplan's ``The
Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero'' (Oxford) and Charles
Seife's ``Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea (due in February
from Viking).
</P>
<P>
   Both trace zero's origins from Sumerian strokes with hollow
reeds in wet clay; both note Greek uneasiness with the idea (for
the Greeks, Kaplan suggests, zero ``wasn't a thing, a number, but a
condition'' ). Both point out that it was in India, nearly 2,000
years ago, that zero was first treated as an object worthy of
contemplation _ perhaps because of Hindu religious interest in the
concept of the void. But it still had a long way to go before it
became a number among others, although somewhat more mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   For in both books too, even as zero sheds light, it casts
shadows. It may have simplified arithmetic (compare the calculation
MM x CCCI with 2000 x 301), but it also introduced a snake into the
garden (try dividing any number by zero or raising zero to the zero
power _ everything falls apart). It led to the development of
perspective in Renaissance painting (zero is in the infinitely
distant vanishing point) and was also associated with gruesome
rituals (Kaplan describes the intricate cycles of the Mayan
calendar that returned to zero every 52 years _ an occasion marked
by the sacrificial ripping of hearts and jaws from living victims).
</P>
<P>
   Zero's heroes, in fact, seem to have had as much contact with
the irrational as the rational. These books are full of zero's
eccentrics and victims. Seife gives us such zero-inspired thinkers
as the Greek philosopher Zeno, stabbed to death after chewing off a
tyrant's ear; the medieval philosopher Boethius, clubbed to death;
the 16th-century scientist Giordano Bruno, burned at the stake.
Kaplan offers John Napier, the 16th-century Scottish baron, who
dabbled in the occult, predicted the time of the last judgment and
discovered how to solve complicated algebraic equations by setting
them equal to zero.
</P>
<P>
   For all their similarities, though, the books' accounts of
nothingness approach zero from different directions. Seife is the
U.S. correspondent for New Scientist and recounts his story as an
accomplished science journalist, standing on the outside bringing
clarity to complex ideas. The prose doesn't sparkle, but the crisp
explanations are refreshing. In explaining how an ellipse evolves
into a parabola, for example, Seife suggests gradually tilting a
flashlight as its beam spreads upon a wall. Seife also gracefully
surveys the weirdness of modern physics, where vacuums exert
pressure and notions of ``zero-point energy'' inspire fantasies of
space travel.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, on the other hand, comes at zero from the inside, always
probing, speculating, spinning elaborate metaphors. He resembles
the brilliant zero-haunted eccentrics he describes _ like the
scientist who, while studying absolute zero, the coldest possible
temperature, sleeps with his windows open in frigid weather and
dusts snow off his bed in the morning. Kaplan's riffs have the
range of an autodidact and take the risks of an independent
scholar; he has taught mathematics and also philosophy, Greek,
German and Sanskrit. Kaplan doesn't follow Seife's path into modern
physics; instead he immerses himself in the metaphysical and
psychological currents left in zero's wake.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of Kaplan's eccentric path are chunks of precious,
puzzling prose (zero, he writes, ``is our chaperone at the dance of
change''). His fearlessness is enticing. He uses his knowledge of
Sanskrit to explain odd arithmetic systems in which consonants were
used to represent numbers. He suggests that the first zeros may
have been the circular traces left in sand by stones removed during
early calculations. He guesses that the design of an early medieval
zero may have been inspired by the brand used to scar a thief's
face.
</P>
<P>
   These books _ one straightforward and bright, the other shadowy
and provocative _ seem to embody the two faces of zero. In Kaplan's
book, the mysterious face is invoked by John Donne: ``How
invisible, how unintelligible a thing, then, is this Nothing!'' The
other is conjured by William Blake: ``To me the world is all one
continued vision of Fancy or Imagination.'' Their sum is greater
than zero.

   BALTIMORE _ Far from contemplating retirement, as many men of 66
would do, Gordon Becker is setting out, again, to reinvent the
business he has been building for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Becker Group of Baltimore, the dominant player in a niche
business that it more or less invented _ providing seasonal
decorations for shopping malls _ is now throwing itself into the
world of ``shoppertainment,'' the creation of entertainment events
and attractions at malls to keep shoppers from defecting to the
Internet. It's risky, as Becker knows all too well: in the 1970s,
losing focus on his core business led to a Chapter 11
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, he says, growth is being supercharged by two
people _ a venture capitalist who has taken a large position in the
company and a successful entrepreneur with a stellar record in
building public and private service-sector businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Those two wise men also happen to be his sons, Eric, 37, and
Doug, 33.
</P>
<P>
   The Beckers offer an unusual case study in deep-rooted family
entrepreneurship. When the boys were growing up, their father was
their adviser in a string of teen-age businesses. Now the sons,
whose various ventures have grown into businesses worth more than
$750 million, are the advisers, stepping in to help take Dad's
business to a new level. Along the way, the Beckers have found ways
to keep the business partnership civil to the point that the
families even vacation together.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a model for how you create next generations for
family enterprises,'' said Fredda Ferz Brown, managing partner of
the Metropolitan Group, a consultant to family-owned companies that
is based in Leonia, N.J..
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Becker's father was an entrepreneur of sorts himself, a
nightclub owner and violinist with his own big band that once
featured Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. No one was surprised in 1947 when
Gordon, then 14, came up with an idea for drawing more customers
into a children's clothing store owned by a cousin. When he dressed
as Santa and sat in the front window for 75 cents an hour, sales
took off. After college, he started a Santa school to supply St.
Nicks to stores around Baltimore and Washington. That business
evolved into a company that dressed malls for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Becker often took his boys along to work, where giant
Christmas ornaments for his mall clients were made. ``I think our
early entrepreneurial interest comes from this,'' Eric Becker
recalled. ``We would bring our friends there, and it's where
everyone wanted to go play _ `My dad's just a brain surgeon; yours
is Santa Claus!'''
</P>
<P>
   A smart move, Ms. Brown said: ``Rather than just hearing Dad
moan and groan at the end of the day about what went wrong, they
get to participate in the fun of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys developed their own business interests when they were
as young as 9 or 10 _ Eric was selling garden seeds and greeting
cards, running a for-profit rocketry club and selling painter's
hats when they were in vogue with preteen-agers, while Doug
tinkered with various inventions. Their father gave advice when
asked, but didn't insist that the boys accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``His approach was, `Good luck, and if you stumble, get up and
keep on going,''' Eric Becker said. ``There was no `I told you so.'
He would ask us what we learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Becker had his own share of stumbles, and found himself
having to reinvent his business every 7 to 10 years. A frequent
mistake: holding on too long to low-profit operations, tying up
resources that could have been better employed. ``It was typical
small-business thinking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After one too many cases in which a mistake by a $300 Santa
soured relations with a $10,000-a-year client, he shut down the
Santa school. And he scrapped a promotional-events business that
booked talent like Igor the Great, who allowed himself to be shot
from a cannon across a shopping center parking lot _ but only when
the wind was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cars were lined up and horns were honking; people were really
tired of waiting and he was saying: `Igor no go! Flag is flying,
Igor no go,''' Gordon Becker remembered with a shake of his head.
He would plead and negotiate and eventually get Igor launched. But
after a while the distractions and frustrations of the events
business persuaded him to focus on Christmas instead.
</P>
<P>
   By 1974 the Becker Group had revenue of $2 million a year but
was making very little profit. A consultant told Gordon Becker that
installing and repairing the mall decorations had become too
costly, so he made plans to close that part of the business.
Somehow his employees found out, he said, and sabotaged him in 1975
by purposely sending decorations to the wrong malls.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting the decorations sorted out and re-shipped put the
company in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection, Becker said: ``I
lost close to $1 million. I was broke.'' But his clients and
suppliers rallied behind him, and he emerged from Chapter 11 in
just five months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Becker rebuilt his business ``by millimeters,'' he said,
his sons were developing their own business ideas. Along with two
friends, they put together several pieces of existing technology to
create LifeCard, a plastic card with a patient's entire medical
history. Eric quit college in 1984, one semester shy of graduation,
to pursue the idea, and Doug decided not to enroll at the
University of Pennsylvania, where he had been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Neither son remembers any complaint from Dad. ``He let me use
his office for meetings,'' Doug said. ``When we needed a lawyer, he
provided his. He was very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers sold LifeCard to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Maryland
at the end of 1985 for an undisclosed sum in the millions and used
the proceeds for new ventures. Eric is now chief executive of the
Sterling Group, an investment company with stakes in a dozen
companies in fields from food brokering to audio-visual supply,
plus real estate interests and a venture capital fund with $100
million in assets. Doug is now co-chief executive of Sylvan
Learning Systems, an education and training company with a $643
million capitalization and third-quarter revenues of $136.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   The generational tables began turning about four years ago. At
first Gordon Becker's approach was indirect. ``Dad didn't come and
say, `I'd like your advice,''' Eric Becker said. ``It was more
like, `Can you come to this meeting, I'd like to know what you
think.'''
</P>
<P>
   That changed suddenly last year. ``Dad turned 65,'' Eric said,
``and called me on the phone and said: `It's time. This business is
going to be you boys' one day, so it might as well be sooner rather
than later.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown saw merit in the choice to wait until then to broach
the succession issue. ``He never pushed,'' she observed. ``It
wasn't a legacy, it was an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   And a good one, the brothers say. The Becker Group has about
1,000 malls in the United States as customers, along with 500 in 26
places from Brazil to Hong Kong to Spain. In addition to
longstanding licenses to use copyrighted characters and imagery in
holiday-theme mall events like Beatrix Potter Easter and Walt
Disney Christmas, it has added arrangements with Major League
Baseball and with Universal Studios for its classic movie monsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for more ways to reach customers with
important messages,'' Doug Becker said. ``My father's business is
in a unique place to present these messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have seen the same trend, and the Becker Group's new
events unit, called Barnstorm, will be up against substantial
competition. The Simon Property Group, a leading mall operator, has
announced a partnership with the Turner Broadcasting unit of Time
Warner to produce mall events, and smaller operators like the
11-mall Mills Corp. are also putting together entertainment groups.
Doug Becker said Barnstorm would concentrate on carving a niche
rather than trying to be the biggest in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Becker said one idea the company was pursuing is a
mini-circus that would perform throughout the mall, with
opportunities for shoppers to participate. ``Your kid could learn
clowning, and actually perform with a clown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be Igor the Great all over again? ``We need to meet the
clients' needs, and the needs have changed,'' Gordon Becker said.
``Malls now consider themselves media. They sell advertising space
on trash cans, on railings, on windows.'' And that thinking extends
to promotional events, with malls sharing the cost with corporate
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   How has father taken to having the boys planning the course of a
company from which he has no intention of retiring? ``I love it,''
he said. ``My mother and father thought I was a rocket scientist
because I took a Santa suit and built a multimillion-dollar
business. Doug didn't go to college and Eric didn't graduate, and I
think they are rocket scientists.''

 &HT;    BETHLEHEM DRAWS WORLD'S FAITHFUL FOR CELEBRATION
 &HT;    770&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ In a land known for conflict, people from
different nations and faiths joined Friday night in the town where
Christianity was born to celebrate the last Christmas of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Manger Square, the small stone plaza in front of the
1,500-year-old Church of the Nativity, displayed a panorama of
religious and international ritual throughout the day. There were
the solemn Friday prayers of kneeling Muslims and the jubilant
tones of a gospel choir from Houston, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The day culminated with a midnight mass attended by Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat and a handful of leaders from European and
African countries. The mass was shown on a large screen on a
high-tech stage.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of American pilgrims and tourists set aside official
U.S. warnings about millennial terrorism and turned out for the
event. The day was overseen by a heavy Palestinian security
presence _ 3,000 police in navy blue uniforms, under cover in
civilian garb or wearing blue camouflage paramilitary outfits and
carrying Kalishnikov rifles.
</P>
<P>
   For local Christian Palestinians, who make up about a third of
the city of 50,000, the day was a salve for wounded egos. Intensely
proud of sharing their birthplace with Christ, they have seen their
numbers overtaken by an influx of Muslim refugees and their city
suffer decades of Israeli occupation and Palestinian uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Eve celebrations took place here even before control
was transferred from Israeli occupation to the Palestinian
Authority in 1995. But this was the biggest observance, and comes
amid nearly $200 million of improvements in the city. New hotels
are being built, roads and sewage systems upgraded, and Manger
Square has been converted from a bus parking lot to a tree-lined
piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Christians are gathering, more than in other years.
They are more united,'' said Nadia Ghattes, 25, who was strolling
the city's remodeled Star Street with her husband and daughter.
``They are trying to show that we are here. That there are
Christians here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were born here, we are going to live here and we are going
to die here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the foreign religious pilgrims and tourists who came to the
city, just five miles south of Jerusalem, it was a chance to see
how the new Bethlehem stands up to the biblical one.
</P>
<P>
   They found themselves surprised, moved and overwhelmed. The
marching bands and bagpipe troupes, a staple of Palestinian
celebrations, caught some off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to see the nativity scene,'' said Barbara Mosher, 68,
a retired acrobatic pilot from Waynesville, Ohio, near Dayton.
``The parade was unexpected. I didn't know it would be so
carnival-like, but I enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin Harlamert, a retired judge from Oakwood, Ohio, said he had
come here before but was awakened this time to the Christian
Palestinian presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are wearing crosses on their necks and that
surprised me,'' he said. ``It's good to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminders of Middle Eastern turbulence were on hand Friday. In
the Israeli city of Netanya, police set off a controlled explosion
what they said was a powerful pipe bomb found in a crowded street.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethlehem, scars of old conflicts remain. The city suffers
from high unemployment and is bordered by refugee camps. Christians
have emigrated in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Stone remnants on the wall of the Byzantine-era Church of the
Nativity show that the door has been lowered twice to keep out
pillaging intruders. Now, the faithful must bow to enter the small
passage.
</P>
<P>
   It was in a grotto atop which this cavernous church was built
where Christ was believed to have been born at midnight on a cold
desert evening about 2,000 years ago. Pilgrims kneel there to touch
and kiss the stone. A handful of shepherds still graze their flocks
on the rocky hillsides nearby, between Palestinian development and
Jewish settlements on land captured by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, however, offered high-tech entertainment and
nationalist overtones for a people yearning for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   At least 6,000 Christians, Muslims, Palestinians and foreigners
watched the midnight mass under a light drizzle. One speaker called
the unusual rain in the desert town ``our Christmas present.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, other sides of the square offered other
cultural samplings. Hundreds of Muslims, the majority faith in this
Palestinian town, knelt in the square for noon prayers as onlookers
stood by with mylar Santa Claus balloons and the smell of shwarma
lamb barbecue wafted overhead. Palestinian flags were paired with
flags of states from around the world on the buildings of the
square.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A spot underneath those flags saw another landmark, if much less
momentous than the end of a millennium. Workers rushed to open a
Checkers restaurant, the first big-name American franchise to find
a place at the doorstep of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a quarter of those attending the nighttime show were
local Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   There have been simmering tensions in Bethlehem as the
demographics have shifted from a Christian to a Muslim majority.
Some Christians complained that even on Christmas Eve, the call to
pray from a mosque on Manger Square drowned out the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   But many Muslims say they also took pride in the attention
Bethlehem derives as the seat of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy to see people of all lands and nationalities
here,'' said Ala Moh'd(cq) Mustafa, a Muslim medical student born
in Bethlehem. ``All my friends are Christian, I have to celebrate
with them.''

PIERCE INJURY BOOSTS WILLIAMS' COURT TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Early in the season, Eric Williams was most active and
most entertaining on the sideline. Always a cheerleader, the
6-foot-8-inch forward shouted encouragement from his seat. He stood
to applaud his teammates when they returned to the bench for a
timeout. His expressive face often served as a barometer of the
Celtics' streaky play; he would smile widely one minute then become
contorted with frustration the next.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last seven games, the sideshow has been dramatically
shortened. Williams no longer has much idle time to cheer. Now,
fans must catch his act on the court.
</P>
<P>
   With Paul Pierce on the injured list for the last seven games,
Williams has recorded six starts at small forward while Adrian
Griffin has shifted to the backcourt. During that time, Williams
has shown that he can contribute. In Pierce's absence, Williams has
averaged 31.4 minutes and 8.4 points per game. His best performance
of that stretch came against the Lakers, when he posted 12 points,
3 steals, and 4 rebounds in 38 minutes off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real unfortunate thing for our team when Paul was
injured because he's a real big part of our success this year,''
said Williams. ``But it gave me a better chance to get some
awareness on the court for myself. It gave me some more
opportunities to play and get a feel for the court with some of the
starting unit guys that I might not usually get a lot of time with.
I think it's going to be good in the long run because they have the
confidence that they can insert me at any position at any given
time no matter what the situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   The extra time on the floor does not surprise Williams, but he
believes more minutes were exactly what he needed to improve his
game. The forward says his defensive skills helped coach Rick
Pitino decide to play him more. His defensive presence against
Atlanta helped keep Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson in check. He used
his height advantage and quickness to guard the Hawks' top scoring
threats and limit their productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of our better defensive players,'' said Pitino. ``He
scores well. He's very unselfish. He's improving his shooting. So,
if you can look for a silver lining, which is certainly not in wins
and losses, it's Eric Williams getting more playing time and
emerging into a better basketball player.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino would not be offering praise if injury had not taught
Williams to make the most of every opportunity. Williams's outlook
on his career changed when he collided with Karl Malone four games
into the 1997-98 season. Williams suffered a torn right ACL as a
result. It took reconstructive surgery and a year and a half of
rehabilitation before he felt he had returned to his pre-injury
level of fitness. Time away from the game gave Williams a chance to
reflect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my fifth year now,'' said Williams, who was drafted
14th overall by the Celtics in 1995, traded to Denver in 1997, and
returned to Boston in an early August trade this year. ``I was
injured three years ago for a whole year and I had some time to
assess what was going on in my life and my career. I'm more
professional now. If Coach P or any of the coaches need me to do
something, then I'm going to step it up. That may mean being a
cheerleader on the sidelines or coming out like I did in the second
game of the season and scoring 18 points. Now, I'm out there being
an integral part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pitino: ``I wish everybody's attitude could be like Eric
Williams and Walter McCarty. Regardless of how they play, they give
you 100 percent and they root their teammates on.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was Williams's attitude and sideline enthusiasm
that first impressed Pitino. Although the 27-year-old did not play
in the season-opener against Toronto, he led the cheering during
and after Boston's road victory. The next night in the Celtics'
home opener, Pitino rewarded Williams with 14 minutes of playing
time. He responded with 18 points, 5 rebounds, and 1 steal.
</P>
<P>
   With Pierce on the mend and Danny Fortson scheduled to return
against the Clippers Sunday, Williams likely will see fewer
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with him. He'll take his act on the road or back to
the bench. And when another opportunity presents itself, Williams
will be more than ready to take the main stage again.

ELLISON COMFORTABLE WITH SPECIAL TEAMS ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Jerry Ellison does not expect to continue in
his role as the Patriots' secret weapon.
</P>
<P>
   First, because other teams certainly must know about Ellison
after he caught four passes for 50 yards in a 24-9 loss at
Philadelphia last Sunday. Second, because he plans to return to his
place as special teams specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I played well when I got in there and, hopefully,
I'll continue to do that,'' Ellison said while preparing for
Sunday's game against Buffalo. ``It's been a while since I've had a
chance to do that. But I know my role. I was brought in to play on
special teams and I am comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, who turned 28 last Monday, showed flashes of
explosiveness in his first two seasons at Tampa Bay in 1995 and
'96. But Ellison made his mark on special teams as the Bucs
qualified for the playoffs in '97 and has made a career as a
dependable player on kickoffs and punt situations and as a reserve
running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every player is ambitious and I want to continue to be able to
contribute on offense,'' Ellison said. ``A couple of guys got hurt
and I jumped at the opportunity. But I've still got a job to do.
You can't get overexcited that you're not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Ellison make similar contributions on a regular basis?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can, but it remains to be seen,'' he said. ``I have
to take it one game at a time. I've still got to prove myself. You
have to get the confidence of the coaches and of the players around
you. If you don't perform, of course, they are not going to put you
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison entered the game in Philadelphia before the Patriots'
cause was completely lost. He caught a 23-yard pass from Drew
Bledsoe, then a caught a 7-yarder at the Philadelphia 13-yard line
to revive some hope. But that would be Bledsoe's last completion
until the Patriots' final possession of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison performed on that final possession, but likely will
return to a lower-profile status against the Bills, though the
Patriots could use a spark after having failed to score more than
two touchdowns in a game since a 27-3 win at Arizona Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``All teams that win championships have good special teams,''
Ellison said. ``At first, when I started playing, I didn't pay
attention to the importance of special teams. But that was a major
factor in our success at Tampa Bay. We had a couple of guys who
could return the ball, but sometimes it was just getting the team
good field position so the offense could control the ball and put
it in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things that happen on special teams can decide the game
_ a slip-up by one guy and the other team can score or block a
punt. And you saw the importance of special teams with Green Bay a
couple of years ago with Desmond Howard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said he always wants to play more but is confident in
his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``My motto is that I will do anything to help the team win,
whether it's special teams or whatever they want me to do,'' he
said.

QUIETLY, DOT-COMS REWRITE RULES ON OFFICE ROMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 26)

<TEXT>
<P>
   A date. That's what Kate Hayes wants for New Year's Eve. Someone
to clink champagne glasses with. Someone to kiss at the stroke of
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Hayes has been doing something she had vowed she would
never do: She is actively pursuing a mate through work. For the
past few months, she has told everyone she meets _ clients,
colleagues, her superior _ that she is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so in the millennium-date fret mode,'' said Ms. Hayes,
who is 25 and a director at Hireminds.net, an Internet and Web
staffing specialist in Cambridge, Mass. ``Some of my colleagues
interview people who are prospective clients, and if I'm not
representing them, then I think I can date them. I feel out the
situation: `Hey, I heard about this party, why don't you go, it
would be a great way for you to meet people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hayes is among many young people at Internet and high
technology start-ups using the workplace as a launching pad to find
love. Not content with redefining other aspects of workplace
culture, dot-com companies, often populated by the young and
dedicated, are throwing out corporate rules that discouraged dating
and fraternization among employees. But they are finding that
writing the new conduct codes, which often allow relationships
between a boss and an employee, is not so easy.
</P>
<P>
   People have always found romance on the job. In a 1999 survey
conducted by Careermag.com, an online job and career Web site based
in Boulder, Colo., 20 percent of 10,000 respondents said they had
had an affair with another worker. According to a 1988 report by
the Bureau of National Affairs, a private research group in
Washington, one-third of all relationships begin in the office. And
in a 1994 survey of of 485 managers and executives from Fortune 500
companies, the American Management Association found that 74
percent said it was all right to date a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dot-com set, workplace dating is almost de rigueur.
</P>
<P>
   ``For such a long time people would discourage any social
interaction at work, but a lot of corporations are realizing that
this is a dedicated work force, extremely hard workers,'' said
Tiffany Shlain, 29, founder and director of the Webby awards, the
Oscars of the Internet. Saying she was ``a bit old-fashioned on a
lot of things,'' Ms. Shlain added that she could see why allowing
dating was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always cared to make sure my staff enjoys their work
environment,'' she said. ``You have to cater more to the needs of
the people working for you. It would be cold-hearted and
nearsighted not to create an environment they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara Engel, a senior public relations manager at Excite(AT)home,
in Redwood City, Calif., agreed. ``Dating isn't encouraged here per
se, but it's definitely a social environment,'' she said. ``It's
not exploited _ people aren't running around holding hands and
making out in the bathrooms _ but it exists. You really get to know
people and you're working toward the same goal and it fosters
romance. People work 10 hours a day in some cases. Your work
becomes your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Like their forerunners in Silicon Valley, many Internet
companies hold happy hours or keg parties at the end of the week
attended by both upper management and underlings. Partly because
most people in such companies are around the same age, the
boundaries of behavior can be blurry.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie  &QL; 
Armistead met his wife, Katherine, at Interactive Planet Inc., a
privately held Internet development company in Atlanta. He was the
senior account manager; she was an account manager. They sat about
10 feet apart. ``Technically, I was her boss,'' Armistead said.
</P>
<P>
   The company had only about 15 employees, ``so there was some
sensitivity to dating in the office,'' he said. The couple kept
their romance secret until it became clear that it was becoming
serious.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they went to lunch with their boss _ Armistead's former
college roommate _ and came clean. ``I expected to lose my job,''
Armistead recalled. ``It was his company, and he cared a great
deal. His concern was being able to portray a professional work
environment to our core client base. He didn't want us to work on
the same accounts in case we had personal problems. It could have
gone either way, but he said, `Well, you're both very
professional.' But he made it clear that we wouldn't be working on
the same project.'' (Both have since moved to other companies.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Ethan Winning, a management consultant in Walnut
Creek, Calif., who specializes in employee handbooks, policies and
procedures, only about 10 percent of companies have written
policies on dating and fraternization. But most employers, worried
about sexual harassment claims, discourage managers from dating
subordinates. They may also separate couples, transferring one
person to another part of the company, requiring one to report to a
different manager or even asking one to resign _ especially if they
marry.
</P>
<P>
   At Internet start-ups, where there are often fewer than 30
employees, such moves can be impractical. And some employers have
another rationale for allowing dating: they believe that happy
employees are productive, too.
</P>
<P>
   But some workers and companies have found that the new attitude
can cause problems. Lori Park and Lisa Bongiorno each recently
filed a $10 million lawsuit in New York state Supreme Court against
Juno Online Services of Manhattan and a senior manager. Each woman
contended that the company allowed a sexually hostile environment
and that she had been sexually harassed by a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Park, 25, who was a software engineer at Juno, said she
dated Matthew Battles, a senior vice president, for the year and a
half she was there. Ms. Bongiorno, 28, who was an account
executive, said she was romantically involved with the senior vice
president for strategic marketing, Jordan Birnbaum.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got there, I didn't want to be involved with
dating in the office,'' Ms. Bongiorno said. ``But I was told that
once I got used to the Juno environment, I would soon see that
dating was acceptable and encouraged.'' She worked at Juno from
February 1997 through February 1999, when she was dismissed. She
blames Birnbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum and Battles declined to comment last week, according to
the company's public relations representative, Howard Rubenstein
Associates. In a statement, Juno general counsel Richard Buchband
denied all accusations in both suits. He said that Ms. Bongiorno's
case was dismissed in October on technical grounds and that it was
without merit. He said Ms. Park had been treated in a
``professional and lawful'' manner; Ms. Park's suit is pending.
``Our firm has strict policies and procedures to protect our
employees against any mistreatment in the workplace,'' Buchband
added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bongiorno is appealing her suit's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Park, who now works at another Internet company, said she
had been terrified to break up with Battles for fear of losing her
job. ``A lot of people were dating within the company, and it's a
bad idea because people treat you differently,'' she said. ``I felt
that everyone was trying to get on my good side or say things to me
to get to Matt. You can't legislate workplace dating, but I
wouldn't do it again. It makes your private life totally public and
if your lover is more important than you, you never know what
they're going to do to you. And it's your livelihood and your
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning, the management consultant, called dating within an
office ``the worst idea you can possibly come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies, in general, don't want to talk about this,'' he
added. ``They'd rather talk about their salaries than dating.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning, who has written behavioral guidelines and rules of
conduct for dot-coms and high-technology companies, wishes that
more young companies would adopt written employment policies.
``They think they're very progressive in Silicon Valley, Boston,
New York or Minneapolis,'' he said. ``They're all very young and
they don't care what their employees do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said couples should be aware of the pitfalls of intra-office
dating. ``You can always say that a dating relationship interferes
with the work flow,'' he said. ``You know how catty people are,
what the rumor mill is like. And the breakup of a relationship _
marriage or not _ can tear an organization apart. The company does
have a right to protect its interest, even without a written
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, there are other things on the minds of many
young people _ like the more pressing issue of a New Year's date.
``I go to tons of Cyber Brew parties and I always mention that I'm
single,'' Ms. Hayes said. ``I can put a spin on it that makes it
business-related, so it's also business-motivated for me, because
when I go to a party I'm socializing but also networking. Even if
it's a bum date, I still get work.''

TIME CATCHING UP WITH AGELESS RAY BOURQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ultimately, there will be a line drawn beneath Ray
Bourque's career. Father Time eventually corners every player,
ordinary and extraordinary, and has yet to lose that little
one-on-one battle between the eternal and the mere mortal.
</P>
<P>
   As great as Bourque has been for 20 1/2 National Hockey League
seasons, he, too, will face that inevitable tap on the shoulder,
the calling out, the realization that it is time to stop. For
Bourque, who will turn 39 Tuesday, the end may come at the end of
this season. For now, though, he remains on the Boston blue line,
his skills still ranking him among the game's elite defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to leave the game where you've got guys saying,
`Get out, you can't do it anymore,' '' Bourque said not long ago,
contemplating the day his career will end. ``I don't want to be
dragging. That's not the way I want to go out. I'd love to go out
still playing a good, solid brand of hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what history records beneath Bourque's name _ and it
appears inevitable that it won't show a Stanley Cup _ he will be
remembered not only for his endurance and longevity, but for the
blend of consistency and quality he brought to the ice for two-plus
decades. He won the Calder Trophy as the league's top rookie in
1979-80. He has five Norris Trophies as the NHL's best defenseman.
He has been voted a first-team All-Star a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades in the Hub, Bourque has been the
Rolex, not the Timex. For nearly 1,500 games and nearly as many
points, he has been the most consistently superior performer ever
to wear the franchise's spoked B. There have been those blessed
with greater talent and acclaim (Bobby Orr) and those with more
flash (Phil Esposito) and certainly more showmanship (Eddie Shore),
and many (some faceless) with more Cups. But Bourque, Cup or no
Cup, has become the franchise standard for doing the best for the
longest period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be remembered just as a guy who showed up every
night and played his heart out,'' said Bourque. ``Just a guy who
was there, game in and game out, and was there for his teammates.
That's pretty much what I've tried to bring, and what I expect from
others, and I hope (as captain) that I get from others. I think
I'll be remembered for that, just as a guy who was there, every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was 19 when the Bruins made him the eighth selection
overall in the 1979 entry draft. Raised in St. Laurent, a
working-class suburb of Montreal, he and his two brothers refined
their shooting skills by taking aim at a makeshift hockey net that
their father propped against the cellar wall in their apartment
building. To this day, Bourque remains one of the game's most
accurate and hardest shooters, always the one to beat at the NHL
skills competition during the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, the whole wall cracked and water came in,'' said
Ray Bourque Sr., recalling how sons Raymond, Richard, and Normand
endlessly fired pucks in the basement. ``We were renting the place.
I had to fill the wall with special cement, some kind of crack
filler, before we moved out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Creighton, new on the job as Don Cherry's replacement, was
the Bruins' coach upon Bourque's arrival in Boston. By the end of
the '79-80 season, Creighton had been dismissed and Bourque, with
65 points in 80 games, had played well enough to be the first Bruin
named the league's rookie of the year since Derek Sanderson a dozen
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's first contract was worth $100,000 a season, about the
going rate for highly touted picks at the time. These days he earns
$6 million a season, almost $75,000 per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fortunate, that I've been able to touch both ends of
it,'' said Bourque, reflecting on the salary inflation every pro
sport has experienced in the last 20-plus years. ``I've seen the
old players that really didn't earn all that much, but went out and
really had a passion for the game, and now the kids who are coming
up are a little different in how they look at it. It seems like
their knowledge of the history of the game isn't as sharp, or it
isn't there as much. And their thinking process is a little
different. They hit the jackpot right off the bat, a lot of these
kids. They're trained like that at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played, I just thought about playing. You just wanted
to play, and you weren't thinking about all the other stuff that
was going to be there for you if you did make it _ kind of this pot
of gold. But that's the way it is now. That's reality.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Bourque's ninth year in Boston before the Bruins finally
made the Cup finals in 1988. He already had one Norris Trophy by
then, was about to receive his second, and he collected 21 points
in 23 playoff games that year before the Bruins finally succumbed
to the powerful Edmonton Oilers. Two years later, on his way to
winning a third Norris, he helped the Bruins again reach the final,
where they once more were rubbed out by the Oilers, who by then
were without superstar Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   If ever Bourque was going to win the Cup, it was that spring of
'90. But even with Gretzky gone, essentially sold to the Los
Angeles Kings only weeks after the Oilers defeated the Bruins in
'88, the Oilers still finished off the Bruins in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes (it's a matter of being) in the right place at the
right time,'' said Bourque. ``Obviously, there are some guys who
are a big part of (Cup-winning) teams and you've got to have them.
You look at guys like Gretzky and (Mark) Messier, all these guys
that have won many Cups, and they're huge. But you also look at
their teams, and many times they played on great teams. I've played
on really good teams. How many great teams have we had here in
(20-plus) years?''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's last great teams won the Cup in 1970 and '72, the Big,
Bad Bruins of Orr, Esposito, Gerry Cheevers, John Bucyk, et al. It
was but a kernel of a dynasty, one that quickly eroded under the
influence of the higher-paying World Hockey Association and, to a
degree, the lack of self-discipline that was inherent in the era.
If only a handful of those players had been as loyal and as
physically disciplined and conditioned as Bourque, his career
likely would have dovetailed with a championship-caliber run that
could have endured through the '70s and perhaps lasted through the
great Oilers teams of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't have enough,'' said Bourque, reflecting on
competitive gaps during his career. ``There are a few things that
come into play.''
</P>
<P>
   Two nights during Bourque's career stand out above all others.
</P>
<P>
   One came Dec. 3, 1987, when he showed an uncharacteristic flair
for the dramatic, surprisingly surrendering his No. 7 sweater the
night Esposito's No. 7 was retired to the Garden rafters.
Esposito's jaw dropped, a tear came to his eye, and the old
building's foundation shook when the beaming Bourque shed his
sweater to unveil the No. 77 he would wear from that day forward.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2 1/2 years later, on April 17, 1990, in the first round of
the playoffs, the Garden was the stage for even greater Bourque
drama. Pitted against their New England rivals, the Hartford
Whalers, the Bruins were pushed to Game 7 and faced with the
unenviable prospect of taking on the Whale without Bourque. Hobbled
by a hip injury and unavailable for Games 3-6 of the series,
Bourque was not thought to be capable of playing in the decisive
game.
</P>
<P>
   But to the amazement of even his teammates, Bourque made a
valiant return, and helped set up Boston's first goal in a 3-1
victory. When his name wasn't listed as a scratch in the pregame
public address announcment, the sellout crowd of 14,448 roared, and
it bellowed again when Bourque took his first shift with 52 seconds
gone in the first period. It was as if he were a returning war
hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't hacker tennis or a jog around the park,'' said
then-coach Mike Milbury, shocked that Bourque could play at such
high efficiency after being unable to skate for 10 days. ``This is
big-league hockey. I don't know how he got through it.''
</P>
<P>
   And if ultimately his career ends without his name etched in the
Cup?
</P>
<P>
   ``So? That ain't gonna change my life,'' he said. ``I mean, the
game's been so good to me. I appreciate the game. I respect the
game. I know what it's all about. I know how hard it is to win a
Cup. I've been through it. But, you know, I'm going to walk away
from this game, whenever that day is _ with or without a Cup _ and
it ain't gonna change anything.''

A WORKSHOP NURTURES ASIAN AMERICAN WRITERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT WADDELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It started in a Greek-owned diner eight years ago,
with a half dozen Asian-American writers talking about what seemed
to be an explosion of literary efforts around them. What better
place for the conversation, since much of the writing dealt with
the struggle of Asian immigrants and their children to come to
terms with the quirks and textures of American life.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of novels like ``The Woman Warrior'' by Maxine
Hong Kingston in 1976 and ``The Joy Luck Club'' by Amy Tan in 1989
profoundly influenced many young writers. But those at the diner
table felt that a more active hand was needed to nurture those who
were struggling with their own work.
</P>
<P>
   The result is the Asian American Writers' Workshop, whose
membership has grown to 600, more than 100 of them writers, and
whose mailing list has grown to 7,000. Operating from a basement
under the Gap store on St. Marks Place and Second Avenue, the group
helps members in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a year it publishes both literary anthologies and The
Asian Pacific American Journal, which features short stories,
poetry and essays, and it has a magazine, Ten, with articles about
writers and writing. It also awards grants to struggling writers
and runs educational programs and groups for writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By supporting the writers, we're supporting the future,'' said
Quang Bao, managing director of the organization, which has a
$450,000 annual budget supported with donations and government
grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each story builds a collective history and increases community
visibility,'' he said. ``There are a diverse group of people who
tell their stories in diverse ways. We want to tell as many stories
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his hope was that the work would be considered purely on
its quality and not more sociologically as a from of ethnic
expression. He said he wanted to move to the point where ``we can
call it literature and not go into these hyphenated categories.''
</P>
<P>
   Members range from established authors to neophytes. In the last
two years many have published works and received generally positive
reviews. Among the books are Lois-Ann Yamanaka's ``Heads by Harry''
(Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux), Ruth Ozeki's ``My Year of Meats''
(Viking), Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's ``Sister of My Heart''
(Doubleday) and Bino Realuyo's ``Umbrella Country'' (Ballantine
Books).
</P>
<P>
   Kyung Cho, a literary agent at Jane Dystel Agency who is writing
a historical novel, ``The Encyclopedia of Korean Culture,'' said
that many Asian-American writers have relied heavily on biography
and autobiography to tell individual stories and historical
narratives. As younger writers begin to define themselves and their
art, fiction, often emerging from factual situations, is being used
by a growing number.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Hagedorn, author of ``Dogeaters,'' which was nominated
for a National Book Award in 1990, said: ``We're not just writing
about our grandmother and a bowl of rice anymore. It's a very
healthy movement, a growing movement since the 1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   The workshop has a program for more than 50 students from 15 New
York City high schools with writing classes, discussions on race
and identity, and instruction in making videos. The group has a
bookstore at their office at 37 St. Marks Place with more than
2,000 titles by Asian-American writers.
</P>
<P>
   But it helps writers most by publishing their works and making
grants. Each year since 1993, three writers under 30 who live in
the city have received $5,500 Van Lier Fellowships. At least 150
writers have been published in workshop anthologies or in its
magazines. The anthologies generally focus on one segment of Asian
society like gays and lesbians, Filipinos and Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Bao said that although the anthologies each have a theme, ``at
our writing workshops anything goes, it's a lab for artistic
experimentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Bao said, the group hopes to move to a larger office
and give special attention to the 25th anniversary of the mass
movement of Vietnamese refugees to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very inspiring and supportive environment,'' said
Andrea Louie, the Chinese-American author of ``Moon Cakes''
(Ballantine, 1995) ``I've enjoyed the diasporaic experience of
different groups. Even though it's different, we're very much the
same.''

   MEDICARE-DRUGS (Washington) _ Federal officials are refining
their strategies to obtain drug coverage for the elderly through
Medicare. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   NY-CREW-SEARCH (New York) _ With frenzied speculation already
underway about potential successors to Schools Chancellor Rudy
Crew, members of the Board of Education and officials in Mayor
Giuliani's administration remained focused Thursday on the more
immediate question of who would actually carry out the search for a
new schools chief in an atmosphere that is expected to be even more
politically charged than usual. By David M. Herszenhorn.
</P>
<P>
   WHITE-CHRISTMAS (Darien, Conn.) _ The meteorologists may say
that there hasn't been any snow this winter in this quaint and
affluent town. But don't to one resident's 11 grandchildren. Come
Christmas morning, they will discover a hill on their grandparents'
property blanketed with snow, giving them the perfect place to test
out the sleds and toboggans they will receive as presents on
Saturday. What's more, they will also see that they'll be the only
ones for miles and miles with a patch of winter in a landscape of
green and brown. But it's not Santa or even Mother Nature who
created their private winter wonderland. Instead, they can thank
the latest indulgence of the go-go 90s: a man-made, made-to-order
white Christmas. By David W. Chen.

   CHRISTMAS-POPE (Rome) _ In a moment he has been waiting for his

Saint Peter's basilica, ushering in a Holy Year that is supposed to
set the tone for the entire third millennium. By Alessandra
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-PRESS (Portsmouth, N.H.) _ Among political reporters, the
extraordinary access that John McCain provides has become the stuff
of instant legend. For hour after hour, he takes on all comers on
the bus his staff has christened Straight Talk Express. In fact,
this maverick Republican conservative will spar and ruminate,
banter and cajole, kick back and hold forth for as long as anyone
with a pad or a microphone cares. And sometimes, even longer. The
result: an unusually tension-free detente between the press and a
candidate from a wing of a party that often has viewed journalists
as the enemy. Indeed, some in the conservative movement are so
deeply resentful of McCain's clubbiness with the press and
incredulous at the huge amount of attention he has garnered _
earlier this month, for instance, Time ran his photo on the cover
and a package of five stories on his candidacy _ that they detect a
strong whiff of favoritism. By Peter Marks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Visitors to Home House could be forgiven for supposing that they
are crossing the hallowed portals of a traditional gentlemen's
club, one of those temples to upper-class masculinity that have
played a key role in London life since the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   It is a suitably grand building, built in 1777 for the Countess
of Home. A rather austere lobby leads to grand reception rooms
elaborately decorated with gilt, stucco, rich furnishings and
glittering chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   Home House is a members-only club, but that is where the
comparison pretty much ends. At lunch in its dining room,
overlooking Portman Square in the fashionable West End of London,
handsome young staff members serve ``modern European'' food to an
eclectic mix of people: men, women, black, white, straight, gay, of
all ages. But all are uniformly chic. They are as up-to-the-minute
as the art on the walls (vast contemporary canvases hung amid
18th-century detail), with their mobile phones at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   Opened this year after an $18 million makeover, Home House has
all the see-and-be-seen theater of a boutique hotel. The Britpack
actor Sean Pertwee and Zach Goldsmith, a socialite, both held their
wedding parties there. Madonna and Whitney Houston have been guests
in the beautiful bedrooms upstairs, while the bar, with its video
screens, fashionable cocktails and music graduating from mellow to
lively as the night progresses, has something of the buzz of a
nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Home House is the latest, grandest and arguably most ambitious
of a new generation of members' clubs to open in the last two
decades _ places like the Groucho, Black's, the Academy, Soho House
and the Cobden. Rather louche, in some cases almost seedy compared
to the grand old clubs of St. James', these newcomers don't fit the
term ``gentlemen's club'' _ women are welcome as members, and most
of the men would view the word ``gentlemen'' as anachronistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can bring a business client to lunch, and I can bring my
boyfriend, which I'd hesitate to do in other clubs,'' said Ian
Scott, a regular at Home House, who is also a member of three
traditional clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can also take my mother to lunch here, and she'll love
it,'' added Scott, a managing director of an advertising agency.
``It's less formal perhaps, but the food is excellent, and it's
completely pukka.'' (That is, first-class.)
</P>
<P>
   Traditional clubs _ where to this day men in Savile Row suits
and bespoke shoes, many sitting alone and reading a newspaper,
order meals of roast pheasant washed down with claret _ were
designed as one more way in which the leisured classes could enjoy
their leisure.
</P>
<P>
   Their rule books discourage the discussion of business (with the
exception of politics in those two great political rivals of the
19th century, the Reform and the oh-so-Tory Carlton Club), which is
certainly not the case in this new generation of London clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Based mostly in Soho, an area of London roughly equivalent to
its namesake in New York and home to many of Britain's
media-related businesses, the new clubs are primarily places to
entertain clients, to table hop, to network and to socialize with
one's peers, akin to power-lunch spots like the Four Seasons or
Michael's in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But in London, ``networking in clubs is more likely to mean
dinner or drinking in the evening,'' said Matt Seaton, a
contributing editor to British Esquire and a member of the Academy
Club.
</P>
<P>
   There is no real equivalent in New York to the current London
scene, where everyone seems to be angling to get in somewhere. The
private clubs fulfill the weeding-out role performed by
list-keeping doormen at New York City night spots, or by publicists
in control of parties for stores, films and some charity events.
</P>
<P>
   Soho is also the center of London's rather raucous night life, a
district filled with bars, restaurants and nightclubs, and it's no
accident that at clubs like Soho House, with many members in the
film business, or the Groucho, a literary club, business is
combined with some serious drinking, particularly as clubs evade
English licensing laws, which force most pubs to close at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a member of Soho House for two reasons,'' said Amanda
Posey, an independent film producer. ``First, because of my work _
it's perfect for meetings, entertaining, screenings. The other
reason is that it's great to have somewhere central where you can
drink after 11 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   The Groucho, founded by writers and editors, is a place for
publishing industry lunches, but by night it becomes a thoroughly
raffish, boisterous, rather boozy venue filled with a heady mix of
journalists, publicists and television folk, with the likes of
Damien Hirst and Robbie Williams thrown in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Soho House has recently explored opening a branch in New York,
but has been stalled by local laws prohibiting for-profit,
members-only clubs. ``I think the laws about clubs are old, and I
think they're holding New York back in this area,'' said Jonny
Ohlson, the director of Soho House.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is often assumed that London clubs were formed by
like-minded individuals for the pure pleasure of one another's
company, the new ones in particular tend to be profit-making
ventures, and even some dating from the 1700s were organized by
entrepreneurs or chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Clivaz, an entrepreneur, who came up with the idea for
Home House, said he identified ``a gap in the market for a club
where you could enjoy grand surroundings with a relaxed atmosphere;
a club where it didn't matter about your origins, your gender, your
background, your sexuality and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly a workers' paradise, though. The fee to join is
$2,000 (less for those under 30 and for overseas members), plus
annual dues of $2,000. There is now a six-month waiting list to
join, except for overseas members.
</P>
<P>
   Members must be elected, and election to all London clubs runs
along similar, traditional lines. An existing member proposes you,
another seconds, and you hope not to be vetoed or blackballed by
other members. Membership signals status of a distinctly modern
kind _ connectedness _ and as power ebbs away from the traditional
ruling classes in Britain, it has flowed toward places like Soho
House, where Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, lunched
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about belonging to the old Establishment anymore,''
Seaton said. ``It's about being connected to the media industries,
which New Labor sees as political tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Labor Party, entrenched in power, has stepped up a
campaign that seems aimed at sidelining the old gentlemen's clubs
and all they represent. The party recently floated plans to ban
men-only clubs on ``equal opportunities'' grounds, causing
consternation in St. James'.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Coming on top of Prime Minister Tony Blair's blistering attack
on ``the forces of conservatism'' three months ago, his reform of
the House of Lords (formerly described as the best and the most
exclusive club in London, with a largely hereditary membership) and
a proposal to ban fox hunting, it seems almost as if Labor is no
longer bent on bashing the rich, but on outright persecuting the
posh.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional clubs, formed partly so men could drink, eat and
gamble to their hearts' content, out of sight of wives and mothers,
remain thoroughly masculine worlds. Women are sometimes admitted
for lunch, or for parties (or as an ``honorary man,'' which is
Margaret Thatcher's status at the Carlton).
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that women are thereby excluded from
power-brokering _ the justification for ending single-sex policies
_ is pooh-poohed by Anthony Lejeune, the author of a history of
London clubs and a member of White's (one of the oldest of all).
</P>
<P>
   He argued for the status quo based on the very decline of the
old-line clubs' importance. ``Thirty years ago, I'd say pretty well
every Conservative MP was a member of the Carlton,'' he said.
``Today, I'd estimate about 30 or so are. MPs are simply not those
kind of people anymore.'' The belief that excluding women means
that they are missing out on major business deals is mistaken, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   If the Carlton is out in the cold in the Britain of New Labor,
Blair's name for his reinvented party, so the Travelers Club,
founded in 1814 by Lord Castlereagh, then the foreign secretary,
and Talleyrand, and reputed to be the haunt of powerful Foreign
Office mandarins, diplomats and the upper echelons of MI6, now
seems equally a backwater. It is no longer a place from which
treaties are brokered and gunboats dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   But while the traditional clubs' influence in world affairs may
have waned, the clubs have worked hard to attract young
professionals, and some have succeeded by cannily extolling their
ancient charms _ leather armchairs, faded carpets, portraits and
busts of past members. Some of the traditional clubs now have
seven- or eight-year waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Victor, an American-born, London-based literary agent, is a
member of both the venerable Garrick Club, the haunt of actors,
lawyers and writers, and a founder of the Groucho, and he finds
merits in both. ``I helped found the Groucho partly because I
wanted a club where men and women were on an absolutely equal
footing,'' he said. ``I took a woman to lunch at the Garrick today,
and she was made absolutely welcome, but there are rooms she can't
go into and so on. That's a very big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are great places for entertaining,'' he continued. ``The
Groucho is somewhere I'd go to when I've arranged to meet someone
for a drink or for dinner, but the Garrick has many of the
qualities of home. I can step into this wonderful old building,
leaving the noise of the city behind me, have a cup of tea, read a
newspaper, write a letter. Or you can also just sit down to lunch
at the members' table there, start talking to the person sitting
beside you and perhaps have some wonderful conversation.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To our day off!'' said Jaime Windrow, raising her
cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' said Amy Krawcek, raising hers. ``A much-deserved and
needed day off.''
</P>
<P>
   They clinked glasses with Kristin Tudor and Jacqueline Collins
in the unison one would expect from four Rockettes stepping out for
the night.
</P>
<P>
   These are not your grandfather's Rockettes. Variously sporting
leather pants, fake fur, feather cuffs, pashmina scarves and cell
phones, these women, all in their 20s, hit Veruka, a downtown club,
on Monday night to replenish calories lost during their grueling
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can't believe we have to work on the holidays,'' Ms.
Windrow said, ``but the holidays are what we're all about.''
(They're only employed full time from October to early January.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Krawcek added, ``we are all so tired of Christmas
music!''
</P>
<P>
   Over eight brutal weeks, two 36-Rockette teams (plus four
substitutes) split as many as 32 weekly performances of ``The Radio
City Christmas Spectacular.'' They have to whip through multiple
costume changes, from '20s flappers to toy soldiers to
white-antlered reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we're so glamorous,'' said Ms. Krawcek, a
spirited brunette from Wisconsin, ``but we're in the dressing room
between shows with ice wrapped around our bunions saying, `Please
don't make me put my shoes back on!' or napping in sleeping bags.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krawcek pointed out that they had just performed 17 shows in
one week, while a typical Broadway dancer does 8.
</P>
<P>
   These four Rockettes, who have been with the company two to four
years, share a dressing room with eight other dancers. Ms. Windrow
likened it to ``a big sorority _ a therapy group.'' Since the
troupe is organized by height, these four, all 5-foot-8 or
5-foot-9, are positioned near one another onstage, and they all
work the late shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go out after the shows and wind down,'' said Ms.
Windrow, a redhead who grew up in Rhode Island, danced at Busch
Gardens, Disney World and MTV and will become a Knicks City Dancer
after the show on Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on and the cosmopolitans kept flowing, the
women were easily prompted to re-enact the ``Marshmallow World''
number from the show, accompanying themselves on air ukuleles. And
they began to spill some secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tudor, a blond Oklahoman, turned out to be married. Two of
the women showed off pierced navels, though they are against
official Rockette policy. Why? Because during the toy soldier
routine, when the dancers do a domino-like fall into each others
arms, there's concern that the rings might rip out.
</P>
<P>
   After a few last turns on the nearly empty dance floor, the
dancers grew famished. On Mondays, Veruka's kitchen is closed, so
they went in search of food, first to the Coffee Shop, which was
closed for a Christmas party, and then to Joe's Pub, where a weekly
event called Slag was in full swing. But it was 1 a.m., and the
kitchen had just shut down. Exasperated, Ms. Tudor, the team's
dance captain and unofficial den mother, ducked out to forage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Windrow and Ms. Collins, a black-haired Long Island native,
took to the dance floor until Ms. Tudor returned with bags from
McDonald's. Ms. Tudor, a vegetarian, ate a Filet-O-Fish. Ms.
Krawcek removed her burger from the bun, firmly declaring, ``No
carbohydrates!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Windrow was reinvigorated. ``We have a day off tomorrow!''
she reminded everyone as she gobbled fries. ``I'm not a reindeer _
I'm a human!''

FOR SOME RETAILERS, HOLIDAY IS ALWAYS WHERE IT'S AT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Scrooge's mandate from the spirits _ keep Christmas in
your heart all year round _ also happens to be a business plan for
John Svenson and Tom Baldwin, operators of two distinct retail
chains that traffic almost exclusively in holiday merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The Svenson family runs The Christmas Dove, and Baldwin is a
cofounder of Christmas Corner. While they sell similar merchandise,
each has a different strategy.
</P>
<P>
   With four stores and a retail Web site, The Christmas Dove is
open for business all year long. But though it is a 52-week
operation with a full-time staff, Christmas Corner opens most of
its 40 stores only in the months leading up to Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   At Faneuil Hall Marketplace, the recently refurbished Christmas
Dove sells just about anything a holiday home decorator could want,
from $9 Snoopy ornaments to $220 wooden figures inspired by the
Nutcracker ballet. For those who would deck the halls with a Tiny
Tim theme or a Wizard of Oz motif, there's plenty of product.
</P>
<P>
   As the store's $600,000 redesign suggests, business is booming,
and among the reasons why are a chap named Christopher Radko,
licensed goods from the likes of Disney, and the insatiable
appetite of tourists for year-round Yule gewgaws.
</P>
<P>
   According to Svenson, collectibles are the biggest thing to hit
his business this decade, and Radko gets much of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to collectibles, his Christmas tree ornaments are
as prized as Millennium Barbies or the latest Beanie Baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one rock star in our world, it's Radko,'' says
Garth Svenson, one of two sons in the family business.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Svensons, Radko's grandmother festooned the
Christmas trees of his youth with hand-blown glass ornaments from
Eastern Europe. But when the adult Radko went to buy his own
ornaments, he found that no US retailers carried them. So he
started his own business, and the rest is merchandising history.
</P>
<P>
   At The Christmas Dove, ornaments that bear his name can fetch
anywhere from about $25 to just over $200, and each season's new
designs are eagerly awaited by the affluent middle-age women who
make up a large part of Radko's following.
</P>
<P>
   Radko ornaments aren't the only items being hoarded. Collectors
also buy tiny Victorian villages made by Department 56. And for
those who want more than a simple creche, a nativity line from
Fontanini offers a full range of accessories. Buying a few pieces a
year, a collector can build a miniature Bethlehem that has
everything but a Lionel toy train running through it.
</P>
<P>
   Licensed products are nearly as big as collectibles. Teletubby
ornaments sold out quickly this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had Pokemon,'' Mark Svenson says wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   If collectors drive the high-end of the business, it's tourists
who make the cash registers ring 52 weeks of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the season, an ornament that evokes a vacation
spot makes a perfect tourist memento, says Garth Svenson.
</P>
<P>
   Already the store offers a line of Christmas mice collectibles,
and some day Boston tourists may be able to buy mice dressed up
like Paul Revere and Revolutionary War patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Because many ornaments are cheap and portable, they make good
gifts for a vacationer's house-sitter or for ``Aunt Mary who
watered the plants while you were gone,'' John Svenson says.
</P>
<P>
   With tourists in mind, he and his wife, Linda, have sited
several of their stores along routes traveled by vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a Christmas Dove in Ogunquit, Maine, that does a brisk
trade in the summer. But because so few vacationers visit Maine in
the winter, the store is closed in December.
</P>
<P>
   At Christmas Corner, Baldwin employs a different strategy. His
Albany, N.Y. company leases vacant mall space for stores that open
around September and close around New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the chain is operating temporary stores in about 40
locations.
</P>
<P>
   With permanent space, The Christmas Dove can attempt to be a
holiday showcase.
</P>
<P>
   But because Christmas Corner stores can be in different space
every year, ``we skew toward the traditional and what people are
used to,'' Baldwin says of his merchandising strategy.
</P>
<P>
   According to Baldwin, better mall locations and a strong economy
have led to improved sales this year. But like The Christmas Dove,
Christmas Corner is a privately owned business and does not
disclose earnings or revenues.
</P>
<P>
   While most Christmas Corners are temporary, there is a
year-round staff and two permanent stores in tourist locations, one
in Atlantic City, N.J.; the other in Lake George, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It was the tourist traffic that lured the Svensons to Boston in
1980, a few years after they opened their first Christmas Dove in
Barrington, N.H.

<P>
   The Svensons located their store in Faneuil Hall Marketplace,
which had recently reinvented itself as a new kind of urban
shopping center that featured food courts and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Unique and wildly popular at first, the marketplace partly
became a victim of its own success. New malls copied its
innovations and lured away some customers. Then the ongoing Big Dig
project encroached on its space, disrupting the pedestrian traffic
that helped the marketplace boom in its first decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the willingness of the Svensons to invest in a remodeled
store, marketplace general manager Skip Coppola sees more signs of
a rebound. When the Big Dig is finished, Faneuil Hall Marketplace
will recapture much of its past glory, he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The new two-level Christmas Dove is certainly impressive.
Designed to evoke a Dickensian village, it's more than four times
larger than the old store it replaces.
</P>
<P>
   If The Christmas Dove is full of Victoriana and Radko objets
d'art, Christmas Corner stores stick to a more basic approach.
</P>
<P>
   After all, says cofounder Baldwin, ``Santa Clause and little red
balls have been popular for hundreds of years.''

TREASURY RATES RISE AS THREAT OF YEAR 2000 PROBLEMS DIMINISHES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For much of this year, the question in financial
markets has been: What happens if there are real computer-generated
problems at the turn to the Year 2000? But as 1999 closes _ and as
the fears of Year 2000 fade _ the question has changed to: What if
there are no Year 2000 computer problems?
</P>
<P>
   That switch in sentiment, prompted in part by the Federal
Reserve's efforts to assure that the markets function as smoothly
as possible at year's end, has helped push Treasury interest rates
higher. Investors simply have decided that they do not need the
safe harbor of the government securities market.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury interest rates are likely to move even higher in early
January if, indeed, Year 2000 turns out to be not much more than a
computer blip. That means the yield on the 30-year bond, which was
at 6.49 percent Thursday, should easily shoot past 6.50 percent,
the highest it has been since September 1997. (Financial markets in
the United States were closed Friday in observance of the Christmas
holiday.)
</P>
<P>
   The main force driving all interest rates higher recently has
been a growing consensus among investors that the Federal Reserve
will be forced to raise its short-term interest rate target a
quarter of a percentage point at least twice early next year to
slow economic growth to a noninflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
   That fear has helped push the yield on the 30-year bond up
almost half a percentage point since mid-November. The yield on the
two-year note, which is more sensitive to Fed rate moves, is at
6.23 percent, the highest it has been since May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has already raised its short-term interest rate target
three-quarters of a percentage point in three quarter-point moves
this year. But the 5 percent growth rate of the nation's gross
domestic product in the last six months is still well above the
central bank's speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve officials made their worries about the pace of
growth clear in the statement they issued after their policy-making
meeting Tuesday. Though they left their short-term interest rate
target unchanged, at 5.50 percent, and did not indicate that their
next move would be a rate increase because, they attributed that
stance to ``market uncertainties associated with the century date
change.''
</P>
<P>
   They said that they still remained ``concerned with the
possibility that, over time, increases in demand will continue to
exceed the growth in potential supply, even after taking account of
the remarkable rise in productivity growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Such trends, the statement continued, ``could foster
inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's
exemplary performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the recent performance of corporate bonds and riskier
high-yield junk bonds, in comparison to the Treasury market, shows
that investors are also getting back some of their appetite for
risk, a signal that they are less worried about Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Since Nov. 5, when the yield on the 30-year bond was 6.05
percent, it has risen 44 basis points, or hundredths of a
percentage point. In that same time, the yield on junk bonds is up
just 12 basis points, while corporate bond yields are up 35 basis
points.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Honeig &AMP; Co.
in Rye Brook, those numbers show that investors are selling
government notes and bonds and buying corporate bonds because they
do not think they need the protection that the essentially
risk-free Treasury market provides.
</P>
<P>
   The selling adds to the pressure on Treasuries. If there are no
bad computer glitches at the turn of the year, the probability of
problems ``goes from small to zero, and you have to conclude that
the last vestige of Y2K hedges will be unwound,'' Barbera added.
That would mean more selling and even higher Treasury yields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Treasuries have more to give up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve should get just as much credit for this
relaxation of Year 2000 fears as it gets for the fears that it will
raise its interest rate target next year.
</P>
<P>
   Central bank officials have been aggressive in their efforts to
assure that financial markets would not seize up near the end of
1999 and the start of 2000. Officials were worried, in part, that
just the fear of computer problems _ even if they never occurred _
would force many corporations and financial institutions out of the
market at year-end and leave others without the ability to raise
cash to meet ordinary needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's reassurance campaign was capped in October, when the
central bank announced the sale of a form of Year 2000 insurance.
In seven separate weekly auctions, the Fed sold options that would
guarantee the availability of billions of dollars in ready cash
between Dec. 23 and Jan. 12. In the seven auctions, the Fed sold
$481 billion of insurance, easily enough to make a lot of investors
feel comfortable.

   NEW YORK _ ``Parties run off affluent times,'' said Ann Douglas,
a historian and chronicler of that endless and great party,
Manhattan in the 1920s. ``This is when excitement is high and
society can express itself by wasting things.'' Her apercu explains
why a list of New York's most talked-about hosts of the 20th
century does not contain the name Brooke Astor. Rather it includes
Leonard Bernstein, Steve Rubell, Gayfryd Steinberg, Malcolm S.
Forbes and Puffy Combs.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to memorable parties, success is in direct
proportion to the outrage produced. Nothing, that is, succeeds like
wretched excess. Parties are to be measured by the column inches of
ritualized contumely printed by newspapers, including this one,
tsk-tsking over the frivolity of the privileged classes.
</P>
<P>
   With this guideline in mind, your correspondent combed through
the shelf of cocktail-party literature (the journals of Edmund
Wilson, the columns of Liz Smith) and compiled a party canon. Here
are 10 of the most famous, and infamous, celebrations by New
Yorkers in the last 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Cult of the Magazine, Part I: Fund-Raiser for The Masses,
Webster Hall, 1913. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Masses was a radical socialist magazine, the flower of the
new bohemia that had taken root in Greenwich Village. It published
short fiction by John Reed, as well as humor and general
intellectual rabble-rousing. Even though none of its contributors
were paid a dime, the magazine gasped for funds, so its desperate
editor, Max Eastman, organized a fund-raiser at Webster Hall. (Yes,
the same Webster Hall on East 11th Street where drag go-go dancers
later shimmied.) Admission was $1 with costume, $2 for plain
clothes. Drunkenness ensued, followed by nudity as the costumes
inevitably came off.
</P>
<P>
   Nudity on dance floors was thus established as ``something of a
trend,'' Terry Miller wrote in ``Greenwich Village and How It Got
That Way'' (Crown, 1990), echoing down to this day. Thanks to the
ball, The Masses was able to continue publishing into the early
days of World War I, known chiefly for its antiwar, front-line
reports by Reed. By 1917, its editors had been indicted for
sedition (all were later acquitted), and the magazine folded,
prompting a snide epitaph: ``The Masses, a magazine that didn't
give a damn, and got caught.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Downtown, Uptown: Opening Party for the Dark Tower, 1928.  &LR;  At
the peak of the Harlem Renaissance and Prohibition, a
hair-straightening heiress named A'Lelia Walker Robinson opened her
136th Street mansion, christened the Dark Tower, as a literary
salon and dining club. It was the perfect site for discovering, as
Ann Douglas put it, ``the potent combination of stimulants and
strangers.'' Rothschilds, rebels and writers, including Langston
Hughes and Countee Cullen, drank Ms. Robinson's exquisite
Champagne, ignored her reportedly banal conversation and generally
``stretched themselves to be as sophisticated as New Yorkers have
since casually become,'' said David Levering Lewis, author of
``When Harlem Was in Vogue'' (Penguin, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``If modernism is the metaphor for the 20th century, you
couldn't think of a better site for it, for the new mix of things,
than Harlem,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robinson, a daughter of Mme. C.J. Walker, one of the first
black millionaires, hoped her Georgian-style double town house,
with its bow front and French interiors, would be a haven for
writers and painters. But soon after the Dark Tower opened,
something went awry. The place was fabulous, but so were the
prices, Lewis wrote, and there was too strict a door policy,
effectively shutting out the very people Ms. Robinson had seemed
intent on welcoming. In their place were mainly ``the rich, the
prominent and the striving,'' Lewis wrote, adding, ``The artists
left hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Block Party and an Angry Mayor: Seventh Avenue, V-E Day, May
7, 1945.  &LR;  ``Unofficial'' news of Germany's surrender set New
Yorkers to dancing in the streets. They were throwing paper from
windows in Times Square. In the Garment District down Seventh
Avenue, they threw fabric, bales and bales of it. ``Every
conceivable remnant, in every possible shade and hue, turned and
squirmed in the thin morning sunlight,'' Meyer Berger reported in
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Then the very garment workers who had set it all
adrift on the morning wind were released by their employers, or
simply went AWOL, to wade and dance in this weird confetti of their
own making.''
</P>
<P>
   They drank and sang and congaed, while planting lipstick kisses
on passing servicemen. But then the disapproving voice of Mayor
Fiorello H. La Guardia boomed over a public-address system,
exhorting the revelers, Berger quoted, ``who had thoughtlessly left
their jobs, to go home or return to their jobs, and I want to beg
of them again, that having taken time off, not to do it again.''
Abashed, the crowds dispersed. Berger added, ``New Yorkers, in most
cases, went to bed at a decent hour, virtually certain that they
would awaken in a new day to be greeted by the official V-E
announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Blockbuster: Premiere Party for ``Around the World in 80
Days,'' Madison Square Garden, Oct. 17, 1957. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Monroe rode in on an elephant. Elizabeth Taylor played
host to what was probably the first over-the-top premiere for a
blockbuster movie. It was given by her husband of the time, Michael
Todd, the P.T. Barnum of Hollywood, and the event arguably ushered
in the modern Hollywood era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Todd's party signified what the 50's were all about:
bigger, better, elephantine,'' said Neal Gabler, author of ``Life
the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality'' (Knopf, 1998).
``It was kind of prescient. He took one theme of the film industry,
the party, and commercialized it: the public was invited, tickets
were given out, and it was covered by everybody. He really got
it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In the Mix: Truman Capote's Black and White Ball, the Plaza,
Nov. 28, 1966. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first large party that contained these three very
different worlds,'' said George Plimpton, author of ``Truman
Capote'' (Doubleday, 1997), meaning politics, high society and
literature. It was also probably the purest example of what can be
called the Irwin Allen-``Towering Inferno'' theory of party-giving:
cram as many bold-face names into as large a space as will hold
them. ``Truman was very clever to make Kay Graham the focus,
because that allowed him to bring in Washington,'' Plimpton
continued. ``Anyway, you had the political world, the social world
_ the swans, as he called them, Jock Whitney and everybody _ and
the literary world, and then all those detectives from `In Cold
Blood.' And everybody in New York knew about it, even the
doormen.''
</P>
<P>
   In Plimpton's book, the novelist John Knowles remembered: ``I
felt as if we were in Versailles in 1788. People were applauding us
in the street as we walked in. We had our masks on. I thought, next
year it'll be the tumbrels taking us out to Herald Square, but at
the moment we were the last of the aristocrats. I remember arriving
at the side entrance of the Plaza. There was a solid phalanx of
news media. I forget exactly what group I was with but no stars
were with us. We arrived and the klieg lights went on because we
were masked. They turned on the lights and looked at us. Nobody.
The lights went off again.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Radical Chic: Fund-Raiser for the Black Panthers at the Park
Avenue Apartment of Leonard Bernstein and Felicia Montealegre, his
Wife, Jan. 14, 1970. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I dig absolutely,'' Leonard Bernstein said in response to a
Panther field marshal's call for Marxist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't dig, not really. How could he know that the little
fund-raiser he'd organized for the Black Panthers in his duplex
would unleash such a torrent of scalding ink, most famously
``Radical Chic,'' the social satire by Tom Wolfe first published in
New York magazine. (It included a long and delightfully wicked riff
on the hors d'oeuvres.)
</P>
<P>
   In another tasty exchange from the evening, detailed by
Charlotte Curtis in The Times, Cynthia Phipps, ``a member of one of
the country's wealthier aristocratic families,'' was introduced to
Henry Mitchell, a ``Harlem Panther defense captain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Phipps tentatively raised the subject of Nigeria, which
Mitchell said he really didn't know too much about,'' Ms. Curtis
wrote. ``She asked if there were any good capitalists. Mr. Mitchell
said he didn't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Last Days of Disco: Bianca Jagger's Birthday, Studio 54,
May 1978.  &LR;  It was just another night at the club that made
Halston, Liza, Andy and Bianca the Peanuts gang of the demimonde.
They even had their own magazine, Andy Warhol's Interview, in which
you could thrill to the chiaroscuro portraits of a 54 busboy or
Fran Lebowitz or Jerry Hall.
</P>
<P>
   This party had a baby theme, so the beautiful busboys wore
diapers, and Bianca _ that's what everyone learned to call her _
wore a baby-doll dress. There were bowls of Cracker Jack.
</P>
<P>
   The male model Sterling St. Jacques, naked and drenched in
silver glitter, led a white horse onto the dance floor. Astride was
another model, a glittery Godiva. And then Bianca and Godiva
changed places, and that picture, said Bob Colacello, then editor
of Interview, made the front pages of tabloids all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled, ``Baryshnikov and Mick Jagger were dancing
together, and everybody realized, `Hey, we can have a good time
here.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wretched Excess, Parts I and II: The Birthday Parties of Saul
Steinberg in Quogue, N.Y., and Malcolm S. Forbes in Tangier,
Morocco, August 1989. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lordy, what a to-do for a couple of oldish rich guys: there were
tableaux vivants of the Flemish paintings collected by Steinberg in
Quogue and a cavalry charge in Tangier. Forbes, celebrating his
70th birthday, wore a kilt and staged a kiss with Elizabeth Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   And the costs! Steinberg, a financier, spent $1 million, and
Forbes, the patriarch of Forbes magazine, spent $2 million.
Columnists all managed to work the name Thorstein Veblen into their
copy, proclaiming the last chapter of the greed-is-good decade.
</P>
<P>
   All, that is, but Liz Smith, who cast herself as billionaire
apologist. She went so far as to print her estimate of Gayfryd and
Saul Steinberg's charitable contributions to date: $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Malcolm was just trying to give everybody a good time, and
people were so ungrateful,'' Ms. Smith said the other day. ``Parts
of it were taxing. Like the hotel, which they'd just painted, and
there was no air-conditioning, and so everybody had to sleep with
the doors open, and it smelled like paint and fish, and the
sleeping arrangements _ Gayfryd and Arnold Scassi in a room
together, and Mrs. Graham with somebody or other. I'm sure she'd
never had to sleep in a room with someone like that. And then, when
we got back, Malcolm asked me, `Why are they so ungrateful?' And I
said, `They're just rich people, and they're not used to hardship.'
The Steinberg party was just a good party. I don't care what
anybody says. It's just that the headline was `Wretched Excess.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rapper's Delight: Puffy Combs' 29th Birthday, Cipriani Wall
Street, Nov. 4, 1998. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It was the night that Puffy Combs, an indifferent rapper but a
gifted music executive and entrepreneur, simultaneously arrived and
peaked in one four-hour period. Hideously oversubscribed, thanks to
a battery of publicists, and buffeted by more than 3,000
gate-crashers, the party boasted guests like Muhammad Ali, Donna
Karan and Sarah Ferguson, all of whom had to wait in the cold
behind police barricades, while Martha Stewart and Naomi Campbell
snuck in through a back door. Combs was four hours late.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag was $600,000, and it included $50,000 for a lucite
dance floor with the initials P.D. (for Puff Daddy), and go-go
girls with spangled pasties, in cages. A fiasco, yes, but since
then Combs has become a sort of paradigm of the so-called '90s mix,
a melange of young Hollywood, hip-hop musicians and the ubiquitous
Ms. Stewart, all linked by one insidious thread, a seemingly
insatiable appetite for shopping.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Cult of the Magazine, Part II: Debut Party for Talk,
Liberty Island, Aug. 2, 1999.  &LR;  Eight hundred celebrities _ from
Madonna to Al Sharpton _ and 2,000 Japanese lanterns twinkled
gamely at Tina Brown's last party of the decade as the fog rolled
in from the sea, a dank curtain ringing down on a show that had
gone on just a little too long. The mist grew thicker, until all
you could see was the boxed dinner in your lap and the back of your
seat mate's head, craning for a look at Demi Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just picnic food, and Queen Latifah screaming at us,''
said Michael Musto, who has covered parties for The Village Voice
since 1985. ``But over all, I gave it a thumbs up. I mean,
everybody was there.''

FORDING ONE GENRE AFTER ANOTHER, AN AUSTRALIAN CONNECTS HIS
WORLDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of ``The Great Shame and the Triumph of the Irish in
the English-Speaking World,'' his monumental new book about the
Irish diaspora, Thomas Keneally says that writing it ``was an
experience akin to being locked in a cupboard with a Tyrannosaurus
rex.'' During a recent visit to New York, Keneally acknowledged the
difficulty of the project and added, ``It was the longest endeavor
I've ever embarked upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Before ``The Great Shame'' (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday), he had
written more than 20 novels, including ``Schindler's List,''
generally spending less than two years on each. The new book took
him more than five years of painstaking work. The result is a
densely researched, vividly detailed account of 80 years of Irish
history, beginning in the mid-19th century. By 1922, when the book
ends, Ireland had lost half its population, most of it because of
the famine or through forced migration. Political prisoners and
others convicted of minor offenses were transported to Australia,
and from there some of them eventually made their way to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the 712-page book is the transformation of
convicts (who include relatives of both Keneally and his wife) into
leaders in politics, business and the arts. Because of those family
connections and the fact that he is Australian, he felt ``a kind of
ancestral weight to tell this story.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the title has three meanings: as a reference to the
mismanagement of Ireland under British rule, the fact that the
Irish failed to produce a working 19th-century state and also the
shame of the Irish being forced out of their native country.
</P>
<P>
   In its global perspective the book focuses on representative
individuals like Thomas Francis Meagher and John Mitchel. After
being exiled from Ireland to Australia, both men came to America.
Meagher became a supporter of the Union Army during the Civil War
and eventually was governor of Montana, whereas Mitchel fought for
the Confederacy and was adamantly anti-abolition.
</P>
<P>
   Keneally described himself as having ``a passion for
character,'' whether he is writing fiction or nonfiction. Speaking
about his new book, he said: ``It attempts to go from the macro,
the wide-angle shot, to the intimate shot. I tried to create a book
in which one was aware of the surge of history, but you were never
far away from the impact of that history upon the flesh of this or
that individual.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ``The Great Shame'' came from Keneally's editor,
Nan Talese. The actual impetus to begin it was the discovery of a
letter written by an Irishwoman named Esther Larkin pleading with
the government to let her and her children join her husband, Hugh,
who was serving a life sentence in Australia. The petition was
rejected, and Hugh Larkin began a new family in Australia. One of
his descendants is Keneally's wife. In the book Larkin represents
the ordinary man, in direct contrast to Meagher, Mitchel and
others, who became significant figures in Irish and American
history.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally Keneally is swept away into stormy narrative seas,
as in his report on the escape from Australia of John Boyle
O'Reilly, a novelist, poet and journalist. O'Reilly's voyage to
America on a whaling ship has echoes of Herman Melville. ``I really
felt the impulses that moved Melville,'' Keneally said. ``That
period of whaling was an extraordinary phenomenon.'' Thinking about
it he decided there was also a relationship between ``whaling and
convictism, as men and women are chained in the bottom of the ship,
feeling they are in the belly of the beast.''
</P>
<P>
   As a novelist in one of his few incursions into the world of
nonfiction, he was a man in conflict with himself: ``I was aware
that I was incorporating potentially wonderful fictive storytelling
into this book as documented history,'' he said. ``When I wrote it,
novels were queuing up outside the door, like cabs at the airport
that I was supposed to be catching, and wasn't able to.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Keneally has been writing stories ever since his childhood when
he was a student in a Christian Brothers seminary in Sydney. At the
time he was considering the priesthood as a vocation.
(Coincidentally, the woman who was to become his wife had thought
about becoming a nun. The two had not yet met.) At the seminary one
of the brothers told him that one day he should write about
Meagher's exciting life. When ``The Great Shame'' was published in
Australia, the author heard from the Christian brother, who said,
``At last you've done your homework.''
</P>
<P>
   While continuing to write, Keneally studied law, then became a
high- school teacher. One obstacle to his career as an author was
the absence of role models. ``The Australia I grew up in was not
one with a visible literary community,'' he said. ``There were
isolated and lonely figures like Patrick White, who would
ultimately win the Nobel Prize. When I was a kid I wondered if you
could be an Australian and a writer. We had such a sense of
cultural inferiority.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he looked to the English and American traditions, and
in the mid- 1960s he began publishing his fiction. His reputation
grew gradually with ``The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith'' and other
novels. ``Schindler's List'' was, of course, his breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schindler'' was originally conceived as nonfiction. Because of
the way the author recreated scenes in the life of Oskar Schindler,
the publisher suggested that it be categorized as fiction. As a
novel therefore it was eligible for _ and won _ the Booker Prize,
Britain's most prestigious literary award. Ten years after the book
was published, it became the source of Steven Spielberg's Academy
Award-winning movie.
</P>
<P>
   That success, he said, gave him ``a wonderful objective in life,
to roll the Schindler book from its position as a marker, the
identifier,'' in other words, to write a book of equal or greater
stature. Despite that position in his body of work, ``Schindler''
is not his most typical book. Neither is ``The Great Shame.'' He
believes his last novel, ``A River Town,'' about ``sin and murder
and the Australian landscape,'' is far more representative of his
work.
</P>
<P>
   Several of his books, including ``Bring Larks and Heroes'' and
``The Playmaker'' (which inspired Timberlake Wertenbaker's play
``Our Country's Good'') deal with Australia's background as a penal
colony. He said that his country had never been able to come to
terms with that past: ``Australia was meant to be a kind of
oubliette, the French word for dungeon, somewhere you throw people
and forget them. As one would know from `The Playmaker' and
`Schindler's List,' I've always been interested in prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to ``Schindler'' ``The Great Shame'' is
unequivocally a work of nonfiction, complete with footnotes. ``I
considered writing it in the manner of `Schindler,' as a sort of
`In Cold Blood' or `The Right Stuff' of the potato famine,'' he
said. ``But the Irish situation is so radioactive. There is so much
argument about what it means and how it should be dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   As with other books, ``The Great Shame'' has had a mixed
critical reception. In The New York Times, Richard Bernstein called
it ``an event, a broad-shouldered integration of personal and
national history.'' In contrast, a harsh review in The New Republic
was headlined ``O'Schindler'' and accused the author of creating
``a disjointed hybrid of fact and fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   In his review of the book in The Los Angeles Times, Tom Hayden
said that Keneally was ``an archeologist of memory,'' and that ``
`The Great Shame' is an important reclaiming of the Irish past and
American history.'' But he also criticized the author for not fully
exploring ``shameful Irish memories, such as Irish racism and
anti-Semitism.''
</P>
<P>
   The book does deal in part with that subject, including the
pro-slavery sentiments of people who had once been enslaved in
Australia. As Keneally said: ``The freed become predators; that's
always the way, and it's appalling. With the arrival of Italians,
Poles and so on, the Irish found themselves going up on the social
escalator and they did not always reach down with a hand to the
next group below them.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally the book was 2,000 pages. In reducing it to more
manageable and saleable size, he cut down on the role played by
Speranza, Oscar Wilde's mother (who was herself a poet), and also
on the man who was Hugh Larkin's overseer during his confinement in
Australia. In characteristic fashion Keneally does not waste
material. He said he would love to write a novel about Speranza and
he recently finished a novel that deals in part with Larkin's
overseer, a book ``that grew in the shadow of `The Great Shame.'''
</P>
<P>
   For him, fiction is a far more expansive form than nonfiction.
``It enables you to say exactly what people saw and felt,'' he
said. ``There are two kinds of eloquence. Nonfiction is trying to
tell the truth, and fiction is trying to tell the truth by trying
to make up divine lies. There is no question which is the premiere
art form _ definitely fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what provokes him to write a book, he answered quickly,
``The unlikely alliance across the fault lines of cultures,'' and
the adventurous people who step across those lines, those like
Schindler and so many of the Irish fugitives and exiles in ``The
Great Shame.''

RUSSIAN-BACKED MILITIA SET FOR FINAL ASSAULT ON GROZNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND DMITRY SHALGANOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia _ As Russian planes and artillery pounded
Chechnya's capital Friday, Moscow said it was counting on a force
of pro-Russian Chechen militia to crush separatist fighters
defending the ruined city.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Russian Chechens are led by Beslan Gantamirov, a
convicted embezzler and former mayor of Grozny who spent four years
in prison before he was pardoned and freed from jail in October by
Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin so he could take part in the
offensive against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Gantamirov said 1,500 of his loyalist militia were
already fighting in Grozny, and predicted the capital would come
under Moscow's control by the end of the year. Friday, Moscow's top
envoy to Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, said parts of Grozny were
already under Russian control and that the complete capture of the
city was a matter of ``two, three, four days.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, speaking as his heavy artillery and cannons boomed,
Russian commander Col. Gen. Viktor Kazamesev told the Globe that
local Chechen militia _ not Russian troops _ would make the final
assault.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow has underestimated the rebels many times before.
Another pro-Moscow Chechen leader, Malik Saidulayev, cast doubt on
predictions of a quick takeover, calling the Russian military
strategy in Grozny ``incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that any assault on the city would put thousands of
civilians who had ``no chance to leave'' in harm's way. And he
predicted the estimated 5,000 rebel fighters defending the city
would hold out for longer than Gantamirov and other Russian
commanders had predicted. ``I doubt Grozny will be taken in the
next few months,'' Saidulayev said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin is trying to avoid a repeat of the disastrous
1994-96 war Chechen campaign, this time moving cautiously and
methodically, pounding the city with artillery and bombs, then
sending special forces, and presumably, Gantamirov's militia, to
test the defenders. The results have been costly _ one such
reconnaisance group was surrounded and attacked by rebels last
week. Western news agencies reported that 115 Russians died,
although the military denied any attack.
</P>
<P>
   Koshman, repeating his confidence that Grozny would be in
Russian hands by New Year's, said civilians remaining in the city _
whom he estimated at 37,000 to 42,000 _ would be safe if they
stayed in the bomb shelters where they have been hiding since
Russia launched its offensive in October.
</P>
<P>
   Koshman's remarks to journalists in Moscow Friday seemed to
indicate that Moscow had fully backed away from eariler threats to
level the city. Koshman also stepped back from his previous
statement that Grozny was no longer fit for reconstruction, saying
instead that experts would assess the capital after the fighting
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Koshman also said an investigation was still under way to
determine if Russian soldiers killed as many as 41 unarmed Chechen
civilians in a village outside the capital, as human rights
organizations and Chechens reported.
</P>
<P>
   A federal prosecutor said Friday that nothing of the kind
happened, and the Defense Ministry denied reports that a Russian
commander of the troops had been fired over the incident. The
ministry said instead that Major General Vladimir Shamanov would be
awarded a Hero of Russia medal.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny's warren of concrete ruins and Soviet-era bunkers make it
easier to defend than the lowland towns and villages Russian forces
have conquered in three months of fighting. After last week's
resounding victory, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin may have decided
to pursue a quick military victory in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Gantamirov comes in. The Russian logic is that
loyalist Chechens know the city as well as the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to put things in order here ourselves, and the federal
army should stand in our rear and provide us support,'' Gantamirov
said recently in his hometown of Urus-Martan, 12 miles south of
Grozny, which his forces helped capture from rebel fighters earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke after his cortege, an armored black jeep equipped with
a big safe in the trunk and an armored personnel carrier with
faulty breaks, roared up to this ruined village 12 miles south of
Grozny, to recruit fighters and hand out uniforms. Russian
commanders, he said, had been unwilling to arm too large a force of
Chechens. But their faith in Gantamirov's fighters had grown after
a small group of about 300 militia had helped take Urus-Martan
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels deny Gantamirov played a role, saying their forces
had left Urus-Martan a day before the Russian forces moved in.
Gantamirov's troops fought on the Russian side in the first
conflict, but without great success.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with Gantamirov is that he was part of Moscow's
unpopular puppet regime during the first war, during which time he
was arrested and convicted for misuse of federal funds intended for
the reconstruction of Chechnya. Russia has ruled out talks with
Chechnya's popularly elected separatist leader, Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   During the trip to Urus-Martan, Gantamirov chatted amiably with
journalists, led toasts and served up shiskabob. But his aides
warned not to ask any questions about his conviction or time in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, officials say choosing to ally themselves with
Gantamirov is merely Chechen realpolitik.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what if Gantamirov took money _ everyone did,'' said Kim
Tsologov, Russia's deputy minister for ethnic affairs. ``Besides _
were the accusations against him as serious as the political role
he will play now? Or course not.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsogolov could not say what Gantamirov carried in that safe.
</P>

MILLENNIUM SPOOKED STOCKING UP 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LifeTabs, vanilla-wafer-sized discs of concentrated food that
take the place of meals: 125,000 jars sold, at $19.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   Survival pack for two _ a year's supply of dried fruits,
vegetables, margarine, milk, and seeds for planting sprouts: 60,000
packs sold, at $1,695 each.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium has been good to Sam Andy Inc., a Texas survival
food company that traditionally sells its wares to campers and
civil defense groups. Y2K has pried the market open wide, said John
Sauer, company CEO. By the start of 1999, sales had risen by 1,200
percent; the company started running round-the-clock shifts and
opened new factories in three states.
</P>
<P>
   And after a summertime lull, Sauer said, sales have climbed
again in the last few months. The procrastinator market, he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   Though a survey indicates most Americans will make some minor
preparations, and mainstream retailers are stocking more staples in
anticipation, most consumers are facing the end of the millennium
with a collective yawn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, and a core of wary souls across the country has been
taking Y2K more seriously, pouring their fears _ and their cash _
into supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Sauer divides them roughly into two groups. There are the
regular stockpilers, who view food storage as a sort of insurance
policy. And there are the Y2K-watchers, from paramilitarists to
professionals, who are paying close attention to their cupboards as
the millennium nears.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Middelkoop, an industrial engineer in Amherst, Mass., counts
himself in the latter group. He doesn't expect a major crisis _
though, in engineer-speak, he says there's a ``non-zero chance of
Armageddon'' after Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Middelkoop said, he works closely enough with computers
to know what could go wrong. That's why he came up with his own Y2K
plan, which he posted on his Web site early last year.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with figuring out where to spend New Year's Eve and
ends with making sure he has ``marginal food sufficiency'' six
weeks after the Big Event.
</P>
<P>
   Middlekoop downgraded his plan slightly over time _ deciding,
for example, not to buy a Coleman portable stove. But over the
months, he has met most of his goals.
</P>
<P>
   Hoard food _ check. A friend found Canadian Army rations at a
surplus store.
</P>
<P>
   Buy batteries _ check. In a drugstore a few months ago, he found
24-packs on sale for $4.99.
</P>
<P>
   Acquire ``water storage device'' _ check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those office water coolers?'' he said. ``One of them
disappeared from the office.''
</P>
<P>
   It's best to be safe, agrees Mike Woodard, a Sam Andy
distributor in St. George, Utah. He started to think about
potential Y2K problems last year, he said, when he scanned the
Internet and came across tales of serious preparations.
</P>
<P>
   After he read about a man who had purchased a cave and was
planning to subdivide it, Woodard decided he needed a disaster
blueprint of his own.
</P>
<P>
   After a year's worth of reassuring news reports, Woodard doesn't
fear widespread chaos anymore. Still, he fully expects a recession,
which he belives will start with Third-World countries and
breakdowns in the supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   To ready himself, he has stocked up on supplies, and plans to
withdraw all of his money from the bank just before the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that everybody would at least be prepared to feed
their family and kids for at least 90 days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While three months' planning might be rare, researchers expect a
steady flow of people to head to automatic teller machines and
supermarkets this week _ and many government officials are urging
residents to fill their pantries for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A September poll by the Gartner Group, a New York consulting
firm, found that 55 percent of Americans plan to withdraw two to
six weeks' worth of cash, and 67 percent plan to store enough food
for a week.
</P>
<P>
   That stockpiling impulse, some feel, could be a catalyst for
good works.
</P>
<P>
   Shaunti Feldhahn, a devout Atlanta churchgoer with a background
in risk management, decided last year that preparing seemed wise,
but was dismayed with what she viewed as an un-Christian trend
toward hoarding. So she started the Joseph Project 2000, a national
organization that urges churches to collect supplies to help the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-area businesses and aid groups have been making modest
preparations of their own, on the off chance that disaster strikes
next week. Area hospitals have reported that they're stocking up on
generators and dry ice. Some ``Meals on Wheels'' programs plan to
give their clients extra food, water and flashlights for the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And several mainstream retailers are making sure their shelves
are fully stocked, to accommodate last-minute Y2K fears. Many
supermarket officials say they expect the approaching new year will
be like the best kind of winter storm: the one you know is coming
three years in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no different than a northeaster, or a blizzard, or a
hurricane,'' said Bernie Rogan, spokesman for Shaw's Supermarkets.
It's a matter of stocking the shelves, he said, with food that
``time and time again, our customers seek out when a low-pressure
area is approaching.''
</P>
<P>
   At Shaw's, that means tapping into long-tested storm preparation
plans and providing steady supplies of bottled water, canned goods
and batteries. And white bread, which seems to sell out during
every storm, Rogan said. He figures it serves as a companion piece
to peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island-based CVS drugstores aren't stocking their shelves
any more than usual, said spokesman Mike DeAngelis; December, he
added, is always a big month for batteries. And the chain is
confident it won't face a run on prescription drugs because
pharmaceutical companies typically keep 90-day supplies in the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis said he doesn't expect much panic, because of the way
customers have behaved so far.
</P>
<P>
   When NBC aired its made-for-fear ``Y2K'' disaster movie last
month, he said, the CVS customer service office braced for
thousands of nervous callers. They didn't get one.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most mainstream stores and businesses aren't seeing much
interest in stockpiling Y2K survival goods, and aren't benefiting
from a millennium boost, said industry forecaster Kurt Barnard,
president of the Barnard Retail Trend Report.
</P>
<P>
   Even hoarders won't bring in new retail revenues, he said.
They'll be bringing home goods they usually buy _ just a few weeks
or months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're buying 20 boxes of cornflakes today, you certainly
have enough cornflakes to last you several months,'' Barnard said.
``Unless you're a cornflake freak.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rap videos often seem like Egyptian tombs, carefully
packed with the musician's most prized possessions. So when
Ghostface Killah, a member of the rap collective Wu Tang Clan, set
out to make the video for his single ``Apollo Kids,'' he included
the things held closest to his heart: a silver Mercedes sedan,
beautiful women in skimpy black bikinis, and his very own Clarks
Wallabee shoe factory.
</P>
<P>
   In the video, Ge, decked in furs and gold medallions,
struts past conveyor belts where muscular men in head scarves are
assembling the moccasin-style Wallabee with its gum sole. He breaks
into rhyme: ``UG rock the sweet daddy long fox mink/chicken and
broccoli Wally's look stink.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means slick dressers wear brown-and-green-dyed Wallabees,''
Ghostface explained in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Sports cars, leggy babes and Gucci suits _ sure. They're to be
expected in the world of rap. But a sensible shoe synonymous with
middle age, sold by a 174-year-old English company? It sounds
unlikely, but it's true: Wallabees are fly wear. Not to mention
their close cousins, Clarks Desert Boots, which have been appearing
on the feet of DJs spinning at Joe's Pub and at Anna Sui runway
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have over 100 pairs of Wallabees,'' Ghostface gloated. And
he's not alone. Other rappers, including Ol' Dirty Bastard, RZA,
Wycleff Jean of the Fugees and Fat Joe also have Wallabees in their
closets, according to representatives for the artists. Phat Farm,
the hip-hop clothing company owned by Russell Simmons, recently
came out with a line of Wallabee look-alikes. And Lugz, another
imitator, is endorsed by Snoop Doggy Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   Clarks have periodically been part of a uniform for rebellious
youth since the mid-1960s, when British mods on their Vespa motor
scooters paired straight-leg pants with Desert Boots, soft,
ankle-high boots with two sets of eyelets inspired by the the
styles bought by British troops in Cairo during World War II. The
look was revived in England by the Who's 1979 rock opera,
``Quadrophenia,'' and again in the mid-90s by British pop bands
like Oasis, Pulp and Blur. But in the United States, brightly
colored, high-tech sneakers pushed Clarks into the background, and
they were the domain mostly of the computer programming set.
</P>
<P>
   But more recently, disparate American style tribes have
resurrected Clarks as a symbol of cool. The rap contingent likes
Wallabees because of their retro appeal, which can be traced to a
wave of Jamaican immigrants who came to New York in the '70s and
paired Clarks with suits. ``African-Americans saw it as an
alternative to sneakers and jeans and incorporated it into their
look,'' said Slick Rick, a rapper, whose parents were born in
Jamaica and later moved to the Bronx. ``It's a way to be casual but
not look like a scrub. The ladies like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the geek-chic crowd, whose style is based on a
humorous reworking of American kitsch culled from '70s television
shows like ``Welcome Back, Kotter'' and ``Vega$.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone full circle,'' said Evan Bernard, a Wallabee fan who
has directed videos for the Beastie Boys and Green Day. ``Wallabees
used to be considered something only geeky loser kids wore, but now
cool kids want to look like geeks. It's hip to look square.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the electronic-music crowd in New York now wears
Desert Boots in homage to all things British and mod. Desert Boots
were first adopted by mods in '60s London after the fashion of
Jamaican working-class immigrants, particularly those known as rude
boys, who were fans of ska music. ``If you were white and wanted to
be a rebel back then, adopting `rude boy' culture was the way to do
it,'' said Don Letts, a filmmaker who made ``Westway to the
World,'' a documentary about the Clash.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Mortensen, a photographer who was spinning records recently
at Joe's Pub, said, ``The mods were all about dressing for
subversion.'' He was wearing Clarks Desert Treks, a shoe style
inspired by the Desert Boot, and Helmut Lang straight-cut jeans.
``Clarks are great because you can wear them to a business meeting
with a blazer and jeans,'' he said, ``and it's a much edgier
statement than, say, the `David Geffen 1980s alternative
businessman' look of white sneakers and a baseball hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as time goes by, the record of who wore what when
tends to get a bit foggy. ``Most consumers are either unaware or
only vaguely aware of the Clarks image being a mod '60s boot or
from Jamaican rude boys,'' said Valerie Steele, the chief curator
at the Fashion Institute of Technology. ``People have their own
associations and probably buy Clarks primarily because they like
the way they look.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Barneys New York, that paragon of urban chic, began
selling Clarks for the first time, alongside Miu Miu. ``Clarks are
part of a backlash to label awareness,'' said Judith Gilliard, the
women's shoe buyer for the Co-op at Barneys. ``If you see someone
with a Fendi bag or a Miu Miu shoe, you can make deductions about
their wealth and taste. Clarks are more anti-establishment, because
it's not as easy to attach an identity to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The rediscovery of Clarks by high fashion is part of a broader
embrace of humble, even homely footwear by designers in recent
years. Birkenstocks, Earth Shoes and Teva sandals _ staples of '70s
communes _ have all inspired imitations by Prada, Comme des Garcons
and Paul Smith. Anna Sui, known for her retro rock-star style,
showed the Desert Boot on the runway with her fall 1999 collection.
</P>
<P>
   To capitalize on the interest, Clarks last year began marketing
16 of its older models as Clarks Originals, including the Desert
Boot and the Wallabee. Sales of the classic models, which account
for 15 percent of Clarks' total business in the United States and
Canada, have more than doubled since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the majority of Clarks' business is with our
contemporary comfort line marketed to the over-35 set, a group of
younger customers have recently emerged who have made it clear that
they're only interested in the classics,'' said Bob Instantino, the
president of Clarks in North America. ``It would be silly to ignore
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also created several new styles this fall dubbed New
Originals, which are classic designs pulled from the archives and
updated with more aggressive-looking, exaggerated shapes. One of
the most popular is the Redland, basically a Wallabee boot that has
been given a contemporary silhouette by stretching the crepe sole
over the toe in front and over the heel in back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger, fashion-savvy consumers have become more interested
in seeing the design and craft process in the construction of the
shoe,'' said Susan Dooley, the director of marketing for Clarks.
Ms. Steele of FIT said the popularity of Clarks stems from ``almost
a kind of primitiveness that strikes people as seeming authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarks are not trying to be more than they are, and because of
that, they seem cooler,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   At Nylon Squid, a boutique on Lafayette Street that sells
British imports and caters to the post-rave crowd, there are
several shelves of the latest Clarks imitations, by companies like
Tsubo and Duffer. The store doesn't carry Clarks, said its owner,
who goes by the single name Harry, because they are available in
too many stores on lower Broadway. But the classic and practical
shape, he said, fits the ready-for-anything look of youthful
fashions that include Velcro closures, detachable hoods and
messenger bags as accessories.
</P>
<P>
   ``People today want to trek around the earth, from nightclubs to
various cities,'' Harry said, ``and if they try to do it in a
platform boot, they're likely to get blisters. You need comfortable
shoes.''

   MONTREAL _ Individuals linked to an apparent conspiracy to
smuggle bombmaking materials and suspected terrorist operatives
into the United States had been monitored for years by Canada's
intelligence service _ and in October were at the center of a probe
by French counterterroism investigators concerned that Montreal is
becoming a new capital of Islamic radicalism.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Canadian police Friday issued an arrest warrant for
yet another Algerian national with possible links to a terrorist
conspiracy that may be planning millennium attacks on the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are seeking Abdel Majed
Dahoumane, 32, of Montreal on two charges of illegal possession of
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Dahoumane is an associate of Ahmed Ressam, also 32, the
suspected terrorist arrested in Washington state last week trying
to smuggle explosives and other bombmaking material into the US.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the most massive cross-border investigations in
US-Canadian history continued to swirl around Quebec province, New
England and other parts of North America, officials confirmed that
Ressam had been under surveillance by the Canadian Security
Intelligence Service from the day he arrived in Canada in February
1994 carrying a false French passport and claiming to be fleeing
political persecution in his native Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring was ordered, officials close to the Canadian
intelligence agency said, because of suspicions he was affiliated
with Algerian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadian spy agency apparently lost sight of Ressam in
the crucial weeks before he travelled to British Columbia earlier
this year. It was while living at the Motel 2400 outside Vancouver
that Ressam and an associate _ who the RCMP believes was Dahoumane
_ are thought to have assembled the explosives and timing devices
with which he was caught by US Customs inspectors in Port Angeles,
Washington Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Police and intelligence services fear the thwarted smuggling
attempt may have been part of a larger conspiracy by terrorists to
attack targets in the United States as Americans prepare to
celebrate the turn of the millennium. Those fears were heightened
by this week's arrests in Vermont of a man and woman from Montreal
with ties to violence-prone Algerian radical groups.
</P>
<P>
   French investigators earlier this year became keenly interested
in Ressam and his onetime Montreal roommate, Karim Said Atmani,
another Algerian living in Quebec with links to radical Islamic
terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a special French investigation team arrived in
Montreal seeking more information on Ressam. But by then, to the
embarrassment of Canadian intelligence officials, he had dropped
out of sight _ apparently bound for British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Globe and Mail newspaper &UR;  &LR; in Toronto, the
Canadian spy service lost track of Ressam because government budget
cuts made surveillance too expensive to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe and Mail also quoted an unidentified senior
intelligence official as saying Ressam is linked to the the
notorious international terrorist Osama bin Laden, a Saudi
millionaire, now living in Afghanistan, thought to have
masterminded the 1998 bomb attacks against US embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania that killed more than 220 people.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, who has a Quebec record of theft convictions, is also
suspected of affiliations with the Armed Islamic Group _ often
known by its French acronym, GIA _ a violent Islamic radical group
whose terrorist operations have largely been confined to Algeria
and France. But Montreal police say Algerian gangs using the GIA's
trademark fundraising technique of robbery and extortion are on the
rise in Canada's second-largest city, which has an Algerian ethnic
community of 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorist experts say this reflects a trend of Islamic radicals
becoming increasingly active in North America, although using the
United States and Canada mainly as a source of money, not as
terrorist targets.
</P>
<P>
   However, said Gavin Cameron, senior research associate with the
Monterey Institute of International Studies in California, ``the
GIA, in the last year in particular, has become less predictable.
It's splitting. That may mean there are factions who are more
extreme, more willing to target...the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the counterterrorist investigation widening across the
United States and Canada is focused on establishing what links, if
any, exist between Ressam and two individuals arrested Dec. 19 at a
remote border crossing in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   US prosecutors say Lucia Garofalo, 35, and Bouabide Chamchi, 20,
both have ties to Algerian terrorist groups. The couple have been
in federal custody in Burlington, Vt., since a search of Garofalo's
car revealed trace amounts of explosives. So far, however, they
have been charged only with fairly minor violations of immigration
law.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo is a Montreal welfare mother whose Algerian husband,
Yasim Rachek, was deported from Canada in 1993 for various crimes,
including use of a false French passport. He has been repeatedly
denied permission to return, which _ given that his wife is
Canadian, and willing to sponsor him _ suggests Ottawa has strong
reason to consider him dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler Neon Garofalo drove into Vermont, and a cellular
phone in her possession, belong to another Algerian in Montreal,
Brahim Mahdi, whom US intelligence officials say is a member of a
Swiss-based Islamic group founded by arms dealer Mourad Dhina, an
Algerian living in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Less is known about Chamchi, who showed up in Montreal in June
1997 as a stowaway aboard a ship from Europe. He is an Algerian
national who was carrying a fake French passport at the time of his
arrest.

<P>
   MONTEVARCHI, Italy _ The journey was two and a half hours by
car, through Tuscany, from the Italian Riviera. The truffles at
lunch were OK, not great. But no one said religious pilgrimages
were supposed to be easy. The important thing was, we were here, in
Montevarchi, outside Florence, finally setting foot upon holy
ground. The Prada outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, only fashion's privileged insiders possessed
the treasure map to this king's _ and queen's _ ransom of deeply
discounted clothing and accessories. Now it has become as much a
tourist destination as the Uffizi Gallery and the Ponte Vecchio _
if not more so. The Prada outlet is not someplace you check out if
you happen to be going to Florence. It is a reason to go to
Florence. It is also the reason we never made it to Florence.
</P>
<P>
   The outlet itself, called Space, is a low, unmarked warehouse
building. The perimeter is protected by high white walls and
forbidding black gates. Very military installation and true to
Prada's martial aesthetic. Inside are the clean lines and radiant
salesclerks found in any Prada boutique. One difference: guards
with guns.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering, our party of six peeled off in opposite
directions, dogs on the hunt. My principessa _ as Roberto Benigni
might call her _ made for the shoes. I abandoned my 75-year-old
mother, who walks with a cane, in handbags. In the men's wear
section, I began frantically fingering suit lapels and performing
the tricky calculus of foreign sizings.
</P>
<P>
   Only slightly more civilized than a New York sample sale, this
was still no place for the ditherer. Shutting out the babel of
affluent tourists _ Japanese, German, Italian, the inevitable
Texans _ I put on my shopping face and attempted to focus. Price
seemed irrelevant, so deeply marked-down were these late-season
leftovers. Suits that would be $1,800 on Madison Avenue were $500.
Our potent American dollars were worth millions of weak lire.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to spend, I could find nothing. A couple of shirts I
tried on didn't fit, and I'm not ready for a suit with velcro
``buttons.'' I watched the principessa's father expertly hand off
pants, sweaters, ties to bowing attendants. Stunned by my
floundering, he thrust a pair of beige corduroy slacks into my
hands, explaining that I must buy them not because I needed them
but because they cost only $70. His is a World Trade Organization
approach to consumerism: If it's cheaper than it would be in New
York, buy it. It's not a question.
</P>
<P>
   I understood. The presence of the armed guards reinforced the
value of the merchandise. Spending was not an option but my duty as
a capitalist and trend victim. Not to do so would be as wrong as a
pilgrim in the days of the Holy Roman Empire refusing to hand over
his ducats for a relic or indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing failure and ostracism, I selected a pair of gray
flat-front pants ($80), a tie ($27) and a pair of women's gloves
for a friend for Christmas ($65). According to the store's
procedure, I handed the goods over to a salesclerk, flashing the
small plastic No. 61 ID I'd been given on the way in. These items
were then stockpiled behind the registers until I was ready to cash
out. Unfortunately, this moment did not occur until closing time,
6:30, when the cashiers were besieged by a frenzy of
last-minute-impulse greed and duty-free-form gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   My purchases were deposited in white shopping bags that said
``Space'' in big black letters. I could see that I was expected to
make a speedy exit. When I tried to retrieve my mother from the
handbag section, a guard closed in on me and made it clear that
re-entry with a shopping bag in hand was not permitted. I did not
argue.
</P>
<P>
   We walked to the car, bracing against the cold, me with my
solitary bag _ a paltry achievement next to the bundles the
principessa was still ringing up _ and my mother carrying the same
department-store purse she came in with. ``Conspicuous
consumption,'' she summarized, not with disdain but amazement. She
had thoroughly enjoyed the experience perhaps the only way a child
of the Depression could: as a spectator, rather than a participant.
</P>
<P>
   It was too late for the Uffizi, so there was nothing left to do
but load up the trunk and drive back the way we'd come, consoled by
the knowledge that Florence would still be there the next time, and
the Medicis certainly would have worn Prada.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, the roaring stock market. With averages and indexes setting
one record after another, investment profits seem like an American
birthright.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at a time when tales of investment coups are as likely to be
heard over family dinners as among high-fiving traders at Wall
Street watering holes, it is easy to overlook the truism that there
is a seller for every buyer _ and that some of those skeptics are
deserting the market, not moving on to the next can't-lose stock.
</P>
<P>
   In fin-de-siecle America, you don't hear so much from this dour
segment of investors and seers, this sloth of bears. They
considered the market expensive when the Dow Jones industrial
average was half its current level. They thought buying the dips
was a trap. As 1999 began, they took comfort in the fact that the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index had never risen more than 20
percent for four consecutive years, as it had from 1995 through
1998, and then climbed further.
</P>
<P>
   So miss much of the greatest bull market in history they did. So
far, in 1999 alone, the Dow has jumped an additional 24 percent,
the Wilshire 5000 has risen 20.6 percent and the S.&AMP; P. has gained
18.6 percent. Most spectacularly, the NASDAQ composite, fueled by
technology issues, has rocketed 81 percent, the most for any major
index since 1915.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy being a bear. As the days have passed, some have
suffered from tarnished reputations and the loss of clients _ even
jobs. And they've had to endure the withering scorn of market
evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could have ever dreamed that this thing would go as far as
it did?'' asked Barton Biggs, chairman of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter Investment Management and the firm's chief global
strategist, who turned wary in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not David Tice, whose Prudent Bear mutual fund, which
sells stocks short in anticipation that they will fall, has been
one of the worst-performing of more than 3,000 mutual funds the
last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Nor Charles Clough, 57, chief investment strategist at Merrill
Lynch, who in August announced his retirement. In recent years, he
has advised investors to allocate more money to bonds and cash _ to
the annoyance of many Merrill brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is market technician Gail Dudack of Warburg Dillon
Read, who was abruptly bounced this autumn as a member of the
so-called Elves Index panel on the ``Wall Street Week'' television
program. Host Louis Rukeyser explained that Ms. Dudack had simply
been bearish too long and was undermining the Elf consensus of
rising prices in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   All along, the technology-driven stock market has soared with an
irrepressible U.S. economy as its accomplice; economic growth has
persistently exceeded its supposed speed limits, while inflation
has remained at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the uninterrupted expansion that began in March
1991 will set a longevity record, 107 months. Productivity has also
surged. And the unemployment rate has sunk so low, scarcely above 4
percent, that many economists are rethinking its longstanding
inverse relationship with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an economy that once looked like a bubble of excessive
exuberance, not unlike Japan's a decade ago, now seems highly
resistant to forces like higher interest rates. And a sage like
Lawrence Lindsey, a former Federal Reserve governor who is the top
economic adviser to George W. Bush, can only regret that he sold
his stocks 18 months and 2,800 Dow points ago, believing them
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their errant predictions, members of the bear contingent
of the 1990s remain convinced _ even adamant _ that they will be
proved right. And they have their reasons. Their rationales go far
beyond the structural bias on Wall Street that minimizes expression
of the downbeat, that makes sell recommendations as rare as
dinosaurs (as the chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange
Commission observed recently), and that can mean a loss of
underwriting business or, for an analyst, being cut off from
contact with a company's management.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some bears say their ranks are bigger than is evident _
and growing with each new breathtaking NASDAQ milestone. ``Some of
our biggest clients,'' said James Chanos, president of Kynikos
Associates, which bets on price declines, ``are some of Wall
Street's leading executives.'' Many other market professionals,
secretly worried, acknowledge privately that they remain fully
invested against their better judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that a lot of people increasingly believe that
it's a bubble _ but they're long,'' said Marc Faber, a onetime Wall
Streeter who works in Hong Kong. ``When it changes direction, I
think you will get big selling pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   At the latest reading, the Consensus Index of Bullish Market
Opinion for stocks, compiled weekly by Consensus Inc. of Kansas
City, stood at 52. In other words, close to half of the large
brokers and investment advisers the firm monitors are bearish on
the overall market. That compares with a fourth-quarter peak of 60
just before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bears remain outnumbered by the bulls, who see the
new economy as justifying the ebullience. They think the bears are
transfixed by historical analysis. ``They're really children of the
'70s,'' said Gail Fosler, chief economist for the Conference Board,
a research group. ``There is just an incredible diffusion of
technology'' that has raised productivity and thus economic
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just the market's relentless climb that makes the
bears bears. They worry about stocks' grounding in economic
reality, pointing to threats like the record American trade deficit
and what they see as unsustainable consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Levy
</P>
<P>
   Leon Levy, a founder of Oppenheimer &AMP; Co., whose Midas touch is
the stuff of Wall Street legend, says it has been a ``humbling
experience'' to have been so wrong on two counts: first, badly
underestimating investors' love affair with technology in recent
years and, of even greater consequence, doubting that the economy
would get through the decade without a recession.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not about to change. Levy, relaxing in his capacious
midtown Manhattan apartment, which is filled with his renowned
collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, sees storm clouds
thickening in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if it lasted for more than six to nine
months,'' he said of the roaring bull market. When stocks fall, he
added, today's avid investors are likely to turn into tomorrow's
cautious consumers.
</P>
<P>
   For Levy, 74, the talk of a new economic paradigm that dismisses
the idea of recession _ and underpins the bull market _ arouses
thoughts of the 1920s. That is when cars became affordable for the
average worker and a flood of inventions promised other previously
unimaginable things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were the cheap automobile, which led to the suburbs, the
shopping center and everything else, and the telephone and the
radio less revolutionary than the Internet?'' he asked. ``It seems
to me they were not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Levy analysis _ propounded full time by Levy's nephew, David
Levy, from the family's Levy Institute Forecasting Center in Mount
Kisco, N.Y. _ is based on an observation by Leon Levy's father,
Jerome Levy. Before World War I, he expressed the belief, then
surprising but now conventional wisdom, that profits are what make
employers hire, generating other blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the Levys worry that the reverse will happen: that a
market break will cause consumers with a falling net worth to spend
less, shrinking corporate profits and leaving the economy with a
surfeit of office buildings, plants and machinery from what they
contend has been far too much capital investment.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Levy frets particularly about the rapidly expanding trade
deficit, which reached another record in October, $25.9 billion,
signaling a shift to production abroad. ``This is something that
shows no sign of reversing, and it has to come to a bad end,'' he
said. Eventually, he added, it means fewer American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, David Levy said, the United States is short of
workers, not jobs, and wage pressure is likely to push up
inflation. ``If the economy doesn't slow down enough to give us
disappointing profits, then interest rates are going to keep
rising,'' he said. ``That greatly darkens the outlook for the stock
market continuing this great mania that we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Plausible as that may be, David Levy stated in December 1995
that there was a 50 percent probability of a recession in 1996. It
has yet to be sighted, of course. And the Dow industrials have
jumped more than 4,000 points since then.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his pessimism, Leon Levy remains heavily invested in
stocks, which he pays other, generally much younger people to
manage. His only hedge is taking short positions in some of the
indexes. ``I certainly don't tell them what to do,'' he said. ``But
I won't give money to a manager unless, when I ask him what he does
when the market goes south, he has a well-thought-out answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Faber
</P>
<P>
   Marc Faber has been a close witness to bucketsful of economic
and financial distress since moving to Hong Kong from Wall Street
in 1973. Among them were Japan's 1989 stock market crash and the
decadelong recession that ensued and may or may not have ended this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has impressed him as much _ or cost him so dearly _
as the wave of speculative ardor that has characterized the
American stock market since at least 1996. It has taught this
colorful, ponytailed, motorcycle-riding investor and adviser some
painful lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest bubble I've seen,'' thundered Faber, 53, a
Swiss-born skeptic who writes The Gloom, Boom &AMP; Doom Report, a
monthly commentary for subscribers. In a telephone interview from
his office, where, as he commonly does, he was working well past
midnight, he sounded like a true, if chastened, believer.
</P>
<P>
   When assessing this market, he said, just look at the past.
``Everything is depressed compared to Yahoo,'' he said, ``but it's
not necessarily depressed based on historical standards and
compared to interest rates and compared to the earnings outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``good news,'' he contended, is that the bubble inevitably
will burst _ perhaps as soon as January, a month with more than its
share of historic reversals, including that of the Nikkei 225,
Japan's benchmark stock index, a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   This implosion of stocks will drag the U.S. economy, which has
become dangerously subservient, along with it, he predicted.
``Should U.S. stocks decline by as much as I believe they will, a
U.S. recession will follow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Faber has made many accurate calls (he was one of the few
who predicted the Asian meltdown) being bearish about the United
States has proved expensive. His short positions are losers, and he
has made little or no gain putting money into gold and gold stocks,
a strategy he has followed for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing,'' Faber added, ``is that you could have
actually made money on the short side in the last two years because
a lot of stocks went down. But if you concentrated on shorting what
you perceived to be the most overvalued, it's that sector that has
gone through the roof.'' That sector, of course, is high
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wrong about the U.S.,'' he acknowledged, citing two
chief mistakes. He said he misjudged Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's willingness to allow speculative excesses to build
after cautioning in December 1996 that there were signs of
``irrational exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   He is unnerved by what he considers to be an overly expansionary
monetary policy here. ``How come the monetary base has been
expanding at an annual rate of over 22 percent for the last three
months?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   His second misstep, Faber said, was failing to predict the
frenzied scramble for Internet and other technology stocks. Many
sell at unheard-of multiples of revenues and have no immediate
prospect of earning a profit. ``I have underestimated the
enthusiasm, the speculative fever and the greed in the United
States and around the world,'' he said. ``I underestimated the
stupidity of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton Biggs
</P>
<P>
   Though not the purest of the breed, Barton Biggs, who has been a
relative bear on the American stock market for only 18 months, is
as gloomy as the chief strategist of a major Wall Street house can
afford to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology, Internet and telecommunications craze has gone
parabolic in what is one of the great, if not the greatest, manias
of all time,'' he told Morgan Stanley clients in a recent essay on
strategy. Expanding on that theme in an interview, Biggs, 67 and a
former marine, called stocks overpriced by some 45 to 50 percent,
according to the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter valuation model. The
message: the place to put money is elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that over the next three to four years, the U.S.
market is going to be the worst of the big markets in the world,''
Biggs said from his 22nd-floor midtown Manhattan office. ``I think
it's going to underperform next year by, let's say, 10 to 12
percentage points and over the next five years by 3 to 5 points a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that the old economy is ``getting
crushed'' by the so-called new one, resulting in a bifurcated stock
market. The old category includes consumer icons that have lost
pricing power because of deflation as well as traditional
smokestack manufacturers. ``Increasingly, the profitability of the
old economy, ranging from Coke to Caterpillar, is under tremendous
pressure,'' Biggs said. Indeed, many old-economy stocks have
dropped to near-depression levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miscalculated how fast the Internet was going to impact the
world,'' he added. ``This is a wild thing that's happening here,
this destruction of profitability.'' Between the third quarters of
1998 and 1999, aggregate corporate profits of manufacturers slid
more than 5 percent, to $163.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, said the technology bubble would pop one day. ``I'm no
longer convinced that the Internet part of the new economy is going
to anywhere near live up to the expectations embedded in stock
prices,'' he said, stopping just shy of predicting that the
shakeout will bring down the rest of the market.
</P>
<P>
   But Biggs is sticking to a global allocation of about 65 percent
stocks and 35 percent bonds. ``I'm scared to death, but it's too
painful to underweight stocks and hold a lot of cash and bonds,''
he said. ``You're risking your business. They don't like it when
you're in cash when the market goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   James Chanos
</P>
<P>
   Running what he believes to be the biggest short-selling
operation in the world, Kynikos Associates, James Chanos is a
professional bear. Kynikos is derived from the Greek word for
cynic, and Chanos makes his living finding stocks that are
overvalued, then selling them in hopes of profiting from their
eventual return to earth.
</P>
<P>
   In this market, with the S&AMP;P 500 selling at 31.5 times earnings,
nearly twice the historical norm, and with highfliers like eBay
going for more than 1,000 times earnings, Chanos should be in his
glory as he goes about deflating the overblown.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has changed his ways.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Chanos bowed to the times and created a second hedge
fund, called Beta Hedge, to supplement his older, short-only fund,
Ursus Partners. The new fund really hedges _ that is, it matches
short positions with an equal value of long ones, a market-neutral
strategy that translates into betting only on his picks of
individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came from the realization,'' said Chanos, whose office in
the Citicorp Center in midtown Manhattan has a seemingly unending
view, ``that the market headwinds had been, and were, so strong
that it was masking the high positive returns of short-selling.''
In other words, the stock market's rise was fueled by such a
powerful force that it was preventing many overpriced stocks from
going down.
</P>
<P>
   The new fund proved a salvation for Kynikos. It does not
disclose results, but it is believed that Beta Hedge has returned
about 17 percent a year since it was formed; its short-only cousin,
Ursus Partners, has been flat.
</P>
<P>
   Chanos, 42, takes no view about the likely direction of the
market, but has not had much trouble these days finding
unjustifiably inflated stocks. He defines inflated stocks as those
whose prices reflect discrepancies between investor perceptions and
economic reality.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate earnings provide evidence. Most Internet companies
have none at all, and at many profitable companies this decade,
there has been a substantial decline in the quality of earnings.
Increasingly, Chanos said, they are overstated because of the
proliferation of stock options, the phenomenon of repeated
``nonrecurring'' charges and the passage of legislation protecting
executives from lawsuits. This so-called safe-harbor law gives
dishonest managements a chance to mislead investors with impunity,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the opportunities to sell short, he must buck more than
an unfavorable bullish trend. Tax treatment of short-sellers is
unfavorable, it is often hard to borrow stocks to sell short and
there is a rule against selling short on downticks. And there is
the opprobrium of most of the investment world and the constant
stream of upbeat Wall Street appraisal and company news.
</P>
<P>
   His advice for ordinary investors is to avoid short-selling. A
much better way to reduce risk, he said, would be to ``sell down
their longs.''
</P>
<P>
   James Grant
</P>
<P>
   The spare, paneled conference room seems to tell a lot: the
rolltop desk, the old Underwood typewriter, the portrait of the
losing 1888 Democratic ticket of Grover Cleveland and Allan
Thurman. And, yes, a large picture of William Holbrook Beard's
painting, ``The Bear Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Grant, 53, the editor-entrepreneur whose office sits
cater-cornered to the New York Stock Exchange, is neither a man of
the 19th century nor a born pessimist. He has been wrong about the
stock market for a decade, he said, because he is a contrarian. And
being contrary in the 1990s meant playing Chicken Little while
other people became rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a skeptical person,'' said the 6-foot-5 Grant, a former
columnist for Barron's, sometime TV commentator and proprietor of
Grant's Financial Publishing. ``I am forever doubting received
wisdom. It's sometimes a profitable state of mind _ but often it's
not.'' Grant, who once ordered up neckties depicting a bear wearing
only a barrel, wryly calls himself ``the world's leading authority
on where the stock market is not going.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Grant was a prominent worrier about the boom in
corporate debt, the thinly financed run-up in real estate, the
fragile balance sheets of banks and the bubble in Japan. He proved
largely on target. But he went wrong in early 1991 as the allied
countries were pushing Iraq out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my Waterloo,'' he said. The stock market took off,
creating enough wealth to negate the debt problems. Unfortunately,
Grant's kept on reading footnotes in corporate reports, he said,
missing the forest for the trees.
</P>
<P>
   With a certain regret _ though he says he is not sure he would
have done much better as ``another voice in the choir'' _ Grant
acknowledged that ``we have monumentally missed it on the
all-important matter of common stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant's Interest Rate Observer, his main publication, has had
some latter-day on-the-money calls, positive and negative. It was
down, for example, on Coca-Cola, focusing on its accounting
practices. Coke, which has had many setbacks, has indeed seen its
stock languish. He was also on target in 1997, when he saw CMGI, a
sort of supertechnology holding company then selling at about $12,
as worth more than the sum of its parts. It now fetches more than
$270.
</P>
<P>
   According to a successful old Wall Streeter, he said, bears
always sound smarter but their thinking can prove a trap. ``The
truly perceptive person, knowing that, knows when's the time not to
doubt,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, while a majority of American stocks have fallen from their
highs _ and declining stocks have persistently outnumbered
advancing ones _ Grant is not ready to return to Wall Street. He
finds one of the best opportunities in Japan, the mirror image of
the 1980's and ``the beginnings of something terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, he is backing his opinion with cash. He founded a
hedge fund concentrating on the small-capitalization Japanese
stocks that he thinks had sunk to bargain prices (and have risen
lately).
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to have been profoundly wrong, negative on this
greatest of all bull markets,'' he said, referring to his
misjudgment in the United States. ``But I've resolved I'm not going
to miss the next once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''

<P>
   Four months ago, Ty Inc. shocked children and other collectors
with a terse announcement that it would kill off its wildly popular
Beanie Babies line come Dec. 31. But Friday, just in time to spread
some extra Christmas cheer _ and, perhaps, stoke the ebbing flames
of the toys' popularity _ the privately held company said it would
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what Ty said, in an announcement on its Web page
(www.ty.com), was that it would let the public vote on whether it
should keep churning out new Beanie Babies in the new millennium.
``After much thought, I am willing to put the fate of Beanie Babies
in your hands,'' Ty Warner, the company's owner, wrote on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers and collectors had little doubt about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been deluged with calls and letters from children,
hospitals, charities and collectors, all begging them to
reconsider,'' said Mary Beth Sobolewski, an avid Beanie Baby
collector and the editor of Mary Beth's Bean Bag World Monthly,
which covers all kinds of bean bag collectibles. ``There's no doubt
in anyone's mind that people will overwhelmingly vote to keep the
line going.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner's abrupt change of heart has led many people to wonder
whether he ever intended to discontinue Beanies. The company did
not answer its telephones Friday, but toy industry experts suggest
that Warner was never about to kill a goose (or duck or swan) with
so many more golden eggs to lay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did exactly what a company should do, which is create
more frenzy for their product,'' said Stevanne Auerbach, who runs
Dr. Toy, a nonprofit concern in San Francisco that evaluates toys
for educational and play value.
</P>
<P>
   That frenzy has reached across the ocean. Toy experts say Beanie
Babies are even hotter sellers these days in Great Britain than in
the United States, where Pokemon and other products elicit the
fervor among children that Beanie Babies did a year or two ago. In
August, Ty set up its first distribution center in Japan. Ms.
Sobolewsky said the company had plans to step up marketing for
Beanie Babies in France, Portugal and Finland next year.
</P>
<P>
   While the death scare may have frustrated collectors, retailers
say it sent Beanie Babies flying off their shelves. ``It was all
promotional stuff, a way to make the product more in demand,'' said
Lorraine Papania, a co-owner of George's Games and Collectables in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   There may have been more going on than that. The market has been
swamped with counterfeit Beanies this year, while many authentic
Beanie Babies have wound up being sold through unauthorized
channels.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sobolewski said that Ty recently fired many of its
independent sales representatives in an attempt to attack the gray
market problem. She suggested that Warner may have used the
kill-them-off announcement to pave the way for a redesigned line of
Beanie Babies that are more difficult to counterfeit. ``I'm sure
he's taken that into consideration,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The telephone and Internet referendum will begin at 6 a.m. EST
on Dec. 31 and end at 6 a.m. on Jan. 2. Each life-or-death vote
will cost 50 cents, charged to a credit card. The company said it
would donate all proceeds to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS
Foundation _ and expected to raise millions of dollars even at that
price.

STOCKING UP ON ROSES, CONFIDENT OF SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 26)  
(lh) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roses, like dogs, have tended to follow me through
the 20-some years of my nomadic gardening, from the ruins of a
stable yard on the North Shore of Long Island to the backyards and
roofs of Brooklyn to the old chicken yard of the family farm in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a lot of roses by now, everywhere from botanical
gardens and the intimate private spaces of friends, to
Sissinghurst, where Vita Sackville-West gardened, in Kent, and
Mottisfont Abbey, in Hampshire, where Graham Stuart Thomas planted
his private collection of 350 varieties of old roses.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, looking at a Complicata, a single pink rose with
yellow stamens winding up an old apple tree, and feeling the
rain-drenched weight of Madame Hardy, a white hybrid damask rose,
heavy in my hand, that I must have taken one of those emotional
snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   The old brick walls covered with climbers; the pale yellow
foxgloves and chartreuse lady's mantle punctuating that sea of
purple, pink, white and red; the dark green leaves of the rugosa
roses and their heady scent.
</P>
<P>
   I could see it all again last weekend as darkness fell by 4 in
the afternoon and I ordered about a dozen old roses for the old
barnyard at the farm. This is my Mottisfont waiting to happen. The
stone walls _ built by my great-grandfather from rocks picked out
of his fields _ beg for roses and clematis to tumble over the top.
Sheltered by the barn and the abandoned pig house (another
picturesque ruin), the space suggests a few fruit trees, like
apricot, peach, quince and plum, that will make sturdy trellises
for climbers.
</P>
<P>
   I want to plant a little history here, too, beginning with Rosa
gallica, a low sprawling shrub with lightly scented, single pink
flowers. A native to southern Europe and farther east, it fathered
one of the first gallica hybrids, Gallica officianalis, the
apothecary rose, said to have been brought to England by the
Crusaders, where it was named the Red Rose of Lancaster. Its deep
pink, 3-inch, semidouble flowers with golden stamens open in June
and produce fat red hips in fall.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Rosa Mundi, or R. gallica versicolor, whose pink
and white striped flowers Sackville-West described as ``red cherry
juice generously stirred into a bowl of cream.'' I want Tuscany,
too, a semidouble, deep purple gallica that Thomas, a stickler for
detail, insists is not purple at all, but ``murrey,'' the color of
mulberry juice. And Belle de Crecy, another fragrant gallica, with
tones of cerise and purple.
</P>
<P>
   It's wise to order roses now, before nurseries run out of their
best stock and while there's plenty of time to get them to your
door by early spring. Roses grown on their own roots tend to be
hardier creatures than grafted roses, which may succumb to a hard
winter. If only the rootstock survives, the roses that bloom the
next spring will be a lot different from the previous year's.
</P>
<P>
   Many old roses make good climbers, like Madame Hardy, which
completely covers a 10-foot pillar at the Cranford Rose Garden at
the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, and Gloire de Dijon, a China rose
with Bourbon blood, which covers itself with large, fragrant
quartered roses that are a buff-apricot. Quartered roses are
usually flat, and full, with twisty petals that appear to be
divided into four sections.
</P>
<P>
   Frau Karl Druschki, a hybrid perpetual bloomer developed in
Germany in 1901, will also thrive as a climber or if trained on a
pillar. Its snow-white flowers start as pink buds and open four
inches across. But be warned: it is susceptible to mildew.
</P>
<P>
   I've ordered others that stand up well to the heat, like Graham
Thomas, a fragrant, lemony yellow English rose that starts as an
apricot-pink bud and opens to a cup of swirling petals three inches
wide. It's a tall shrub type that can easily grow to nine feet tall
and five feet across, so give it space.
</P>
<P>
   Named in honor of the venerable plantsman who brought so many
old roses back from oblivion, Graham Thomas is one of many English
roses developed by David Austin. They combine the voluptuous shape,
color and fragrance of old roses with the vigor and perpetual
flowering of modern ones.
</P>
<P>
   Other heat-tolerant beauties on my list are Othello, a very
fragrant, deep red English rose that darkens to near-purple and can
be trained on a pillar or fence, and Zephirine Drouhin, a deep pink
Bourbon rose developed in 1868 that makes a good climber and blooms
all season. It's very fragrant and has few thorns. Experts warn
that these two have a tendency to mildew, but I'll take the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Dortmund, a bright-red single with a white center, stands up to
both heat and cold. It's hardy to 30 below, so I forgive its scant
scent.
</P>
<P>
   Other climbers include Souvenir de la Malmaison, named in honor
of the Empress Josephine's garden at Malmaison, with fragrant
pink-white quartered blossoms that open wide and flat, and the
yellow, lightly scented Lady Banks rose, Rosa banksiae Lutea, a
rambler (a climber with long, flexible canes). Lady Banks' canes,
which are thornless, can grow 20 feet, and they have exfoliating
bark the color of cinnamon. This one is great for growing over a
porch roof.
</P>
<P>
   Fruehlingsgold, a shrub rose with fragrant, near-single,
butter-yellow petals and golden stamens, also crept onto my list,
somehow. So did Madame Gregoire Staechlin, a large-flowered pink
climber with silken petals.
</P>
<P>
   It breaks your heart because it blooms so briefly in the spring
and then again in the fall.

roots.

 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ When Nakamasa Okamoto arrived in the mid-1980s from
Kyoto, Japan, and opened the Naniwa restaurant in a shopping center
here, Japanese contractors building Singapore's subway lined up to
get in. Over the years, karaoke lounges and other Japanese
restaurants filled the building, serving legions of Japanese
bankers and traders who arrived to do business from this hub of
Southeast Asian commerce.
</P>
<P>
   With its racks of sake bottles and decorative fans, the Naniwa
prospered, a cozy retreat in a Japanese mercantile empire that
Western investors overlooked until recent years. Okamoto added a
karaoke room and hired three chefs from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But the financial crisis that rocked Southeast Asia in 1997 and
1998 also pummeled Japan, the region's largest foreign lender and
investor. So, already suffering from recession at home, Japan
rushed to cut its exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the shopping center around the Naniwa is much quieter.
Where once 120 businessmen a night would visit Okamoto's restaurant
and spend up to $90 each, now only about 35 come to spend half as
much. Okamoto has had to close the karaoke room, lay off his chefs
and start cooking himself. ``All my regular customers went back to
Japan,'' Okamoto said. ``It's getting hard to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Southeast Asia claws its way back to economic health,
Japan Inc. still appears to be retreating. In the first half of
1999, Japanese banks pulled nearly $10 billion in loans from the
region, part of a rollback that has sucked $108 billion out of
Southeast Asia since 1995 and cut Japan's share of foreign lending
here from more than half to less than one-third. Last year,
Japanese investment fell by almost half; Japan has been displaced
by Britain, which has also reduced its interests in Southeast Asia,
atop the list of the region's largest foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Southeast Asia's bureaucrats and industrialists
have slowly been abandoning a model of economic and corporate
management that they learned from Japan _ one in which the state
steers the economy and channels people's savings to a core of
powerful banks and conglomerates to develop manufacturing exports.
Instead, they are struggling to adapt to a British-American vision
of free and transparent markets, a shift that seems increasingly
inevitable because of the advance of the Internet and its free flow
of information.
</P>
<P>
   It is a difficult transition, one that pits Asia's political
establishment against the demands of a new global marketplace.
Asian politicians accustomed to decades of economic control now
preach the gospel of commercial upheaval: free enterprise,
entrepreneurship, deregulation and competition. Beneath the
rhetoric, however, economic recovery and swollen public coffers are
allowing them to proceed deliberately, even haphazardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bit of experimentation going on right now,'' said
Mark Hansen, a consultant at Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton in Jakarta who
has lived in the region for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   That has not escaped notice in Tokyo. Despite the increasing
popularity abroad of Japan's high-technology wizardry and animated
emissaries like the Pokemon characters, the country's financial
muscle in Asia is waning, part of a broad decline in its economic
power. Western companies, according to a recent report by Japan's
Nomura Research Institute, ``may replace Japanese companies'
dominant position there in the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Western investors are not filling the void just
yet. For one thing, Asia doesn't need to replace all that Japanese
money: it was part of the capital overexpansion that set the stage
for the crisis in the first place. And most investment bankers in
the region say their customers back home still consider Asia too
risky. ``There's still a big gap between offshore investors'
appetite for risk and Asia's credit fundamentals,'' said Stephen W.
Berger, managing director of J.P. Morgan's investment banking unit
here.
</P>
<P>
   So in large part, the region itself is picking up the slack.
With their own banks paralyzed by bad debts, Asian companies are
repaying Japan by selling stocks and bonds to investors at home.
That, in turn, is promoting more sophisticated and transparent
capital markets, while reducing Southeast Asia's reliance on
fair-weather funds from abroad and the political strings that are
attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're regaining the upper hand over the political
environment,'' said William C. Belchere, head of fixed-income
research and strategy at Merrill Lynch in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   All of this appears likely to alter irrevocably a relationship
that dates to the early part of this century, when a rapidly
industrializing Japan ventured into Southeast Asia for oil, rubber
and other raw materials. In return, Japan promised to liberate the
region from European rule and establish what it called the Greater
East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

ARMY MUTINEERS SAY THEY CONTROL IVORY COAST GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Ivory Coast, long a bastion of stability in
turbulent West Africa, was shaken Friday as army mutineers claimed
to have overthrown the government in what would be the nation's
first such takeover since independence.
</P>
<P>
   A day after angry soldiers marched through the streets of the
capital, Abidjan, protesting over pay and living conditions, former
army chief of staff Robert Guei declared on state television that
``from this instant, President Henri Konan Bedie is no longer
president of Ivory Coast.'' Guei suspended the country's courts,
parliament, and constitution, and imposed a nighttime curfew from 9
p.m. to 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the mutineers' control remained uncertain early
Saturday. Military loyalists said Bedie was still in command, but
diplomatic sources said he had taken refuge at the French Embassy.
Meanwhile, the world community condemned the coup.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest in Abidjan marks a sour end to the year in Africa,
when many leaders express hope that the dawning century will be
witness to widespread renewal and progress on the continent, and
comes at a particularly delicate time for West Africa. Nigeria is
in the middle of a tense transition from military role to
democracy. Sierra Leone was torn apart this year after troops
rebelled against the government _ protesting, among other things,
inadequate pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivory Coast is an important test case,'' said Roger Berry, an
Africa specialist at GPC O'Neill and Associates, a public affairs
consulting firm in Boston. ``It is basically coming out of a
20-plus year benign dictatorship. The country was taking steps to
modernize its economy. Democracy was trying to break through. Now
the past is rearing its head, and it will be interesting to see if
the center holds.''
</P>
<P>
   The overthrow recalls a warning made by South African President
Thabo Mbeki last year after a coup in another West African country,
Togo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year 2000 is upon us,'' Mbeki, the chief visionary of an
African Renaissance, told African leaders in 1998. ``To achieve an
African renewal in politics, in economics, in social life and in
culture we have to act together as Africans. As Africans we must
get together and say it is incorrect for anyone of us to steal a
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest cocoa producer, Ivory Coast was under
one-man rule from independence from France in 1960 to the death of
its first president, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, in 1993. Its trademark
stability masked underlying cleavages, including a deep rift
between Bedie, who was elected president in 1995, and Guei, who was
appointed military chief by Houphouet in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie sacked Guei shortly after coming to power after the
military chief criticized the new president for using soldiers to
quell student riots in 1995. Guei joined Bedie's Cabinet a year
later as minister of sports, but was fired again for unknown
reasons after the 1996 Olympics. In 1997, he faced a final
humiliation when Bedie ordered him removed from the military
entirely in the wake of unsubstantiated allegations that Guei had
tried to plan a coup two year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Political sources say that rivalry between Guei and Bedie dates
back to the death of Houphouet-Boigny, when former Prime Minister
Alassane Ouattara briefly challenged Bedie, the constitutional
successor, for the presidency. Ouattara had planned to challenge
Bedie in an election next October,
</P>
<P>
   Guei demanded Friday that all political prisoners be released,
including 11 leaders of Outtara's party. ``Power is in my hands,''
Guei said. ``I will take care of everybody. You should not be
worried.'' The strength of Guei's movement is, however, uncertain.
He appears to have fewer than 500 soldiers out of a 7,000-strong
army backing his plot, according to diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Military sources, meanwhile, told Reuters that Bedie had given
the order to loyalist forces to counterattack but that he and his
commanders were debating how best to crush the revolt without
civilian casualties. Initial orders called for a low-key approach.
</P>
<P>
   Friday opened in Abidjan with sporadic gunfire, and mobs of
youth spread out, hijacking cars and mugging commuters.
</P>
<P>
   UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the coup, saying
``violence to disrupt a country's political process is
unacceptable.'' And France, which still has troops inside its
former colony, issued a statement calling for the ``immediate
re-establishment of order and security in Abidjan.''

 SINGAPORE: Co-Prosperity Sphere.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is just what Western observers said Japan had finally
achieved by the early 1990s. Japanese companies, expelled during
World War II, returned to Southeast Asia in the 1950s with
Washington's encouragement. By the mid-'60s, Bangkok was glowing
with neon signs advertising Japanese products. Japanese motor
scooters choked the streets of Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's financiers were close behind. ``Banks followed, first
lending to Japanese companies, then countries and then companies
down there,'' said Koji Yamashita, a credit officer at the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan who spent 13 years in Southeast Asia
for the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of yen began in earnest in 1985, when the Plaza
Accord, an effort by the Group of Seven industrialized nations to
devalue the U.S. dollar, sent the Japanese currency surging. As
their goods became more expensive overseas, Japanese exporters
hurried to build factories in Southeast Asia, where land and labor
were cheaper. Matsushita Electric Industrial, for example, now has
58 factories around Southeast Asia, 14 of them in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   The strong yen helped finance Asia's so-called miracle. It also
created an asset bubble in Japan that the Japanese central bank
finally punctured in 1989. High and then record low interest rates
both worked to drive Japanese banks deeper into Southeast Asia,
where they became a ready source of cheap funds. By 1995, Japan
accounted for more than half of all foreign loans to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economic stature in the region is also reflected in
trade figures. Despite Southeast Asia's latest troubles, Japan
racked up a trade surplus of 854 billion yen with the region in its
most recent fiscal year, which ended on March 31; the year before,
the surplus stood at 2.1 trillion yen.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of Japan's economic brawn still abounds, from its cars
(9 of 10 vehicles in Thailand are Japanese) to its tourists (Japan
is Southeast Asia's largest single source of visitors). The biggest
shopping mall on Singapore's Orchard Road is anchored by the
Japanese department store Takashimaya. Isetan, Seiyu, Parco and
Sogo all have department stores here, each a commercial aircraft
carrier in a Japanese retail flotilla and a lifeline for the more
than 30,000 Japanese residents of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Daimaru's grocery in Singapore, for example, offers all the
tastes of home: dried seaweed, $2 pears flown from northern Japan
and, most important to Daimaru's largely Japanese clientele,
Japanese beer by the case. In the same shopping center are a golf
store, a Japanese bookshop and a school for Japanese tea
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Americans largely ignored Asia's yen-driven
metamorphosis. ``U.S. investors really weren't
internationalizing,'' said Jesper Koll, an economist at Merrill
Lynch in Tokyo. ``Even people who were investing in Japan were
considered madmen.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the United States decided that it was time to get in on
the region's boom. Under Robert Rubin, then the Treasury secretary,
the department worked to open Asian capital markets. At the same
time, the Group of Seven agreed to push up the value of the dollar
against the yen _ the Plaza Accord in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   As European banks joined their U.S. counterparts in cashing in,
the Japanese were cashing out. In 1995, $47 billion in Japanese
loans drained from Southeast Asia, an amount almost equal to what
all the other foreign lenders combined were pumping in.
</P>
<P>
   But what has sent Japanese banks running was not the $77.5
billion in loans they still have in Southeast Asia. It is the $272
billion in bad loans they still have in Japan. Of the 1.13 trillion
yen in problem loans at Sanwa Bank, for example, only about 12
percent are in Asia outside Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is at home, not here,'' said Akio Takeuchi,
general manager of the Southeast Asian operations of Fuji Bank.
</P>
<P>
   As banks pulled back, Japanese investment in Southeast Asia also
evaporated. Direct investment by Japan fell last year to its lowest
since 1993; in Indonesia, for example, it dropped 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese investment in the region may never be the same. Osamu
Hosokobu, director of the venture capital firm Japan Asia
Investment in Singapore, says Japanese manufacturers already have
enough factories in the region. Most future investment, he says,
will probably be for upgrading operations, not building new ones.
``Japanese investment in Asia is almost done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese worry that Japan has lost respect as an economic
role model. Among them is Kazuo Sugino, secretary-general of the
Singapore Japanese Association, a private club for Japanese
residents. In a room adorned with photographs of Japanese naval
vessels and Japan's emperor, Sugino recalled Singapore's founding
prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, holding up Japan as a model. ``These
days,'' he said, ``I never hear Singapore's leaders praise Japan's
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said J. Mark Mobius, president of the Templeton
Emerging Markets fund, ``most of these countries have begun to
reject the Japanese model.'' Singapore is leading the trend,
fostering an entrepreneurial class and a bond market, deregulating
its financial markets and opening its banking industry to foreign
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand's central bank recently prohibited senior bank
executives from holding more than three company directorships, a
move intended to break up the links between lenders and borrowers _
a hallmark of Japan's system. Minority-shareholder rights are
gaining ground, too, and freewheeling, Silicon Valley-style venture
capitalism is the rage.

 SINGAPORE: the rage.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors like Mobius yearn for even faster change, but
nationalism is a powerful obstacle. Many Southeast Asians, see the
changes as a new imperialism. In their eyes, the opening of capital
markets means accepting foreign ownership and management of
national icons.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in Indonesia and Thailand, efforts to settle billions of
dollars in unpaid corporate debts often stumble over the likelihood
that doing so would mean selling out to Western investors, who,
unlike their Japanese predecessors, refuse to be silent partners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps furthest from rejecting its tutor to the north is
Malaysia. When Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad came to power in
1981, during an economic recession, he urged Malaysians to ``look
East'' to Japan; today, he remains one of the region's most vocal
opponents of what he calls Western market fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia was one of the few Southeast Asian countries to survive
the latest crisis without having to accept money from the
International Monetary Fund. And the country's apparent success
emboldens those who, while conceding that slumping investment may
cost Japan some influence, say the Japan example has not been
discredited. ``I don't think there was any proof that the Japanese
financial model failed,'' said Takatoshi Ito, an economics
professor who this year took over as Japan's deputy vice finance
minister for international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Ito and his predecessor Eisuke Sakakibara share Mahathir's
disdain for the wrenching economic changes that the IMF made
prerequisite to the $118 billion in emergency financial aid it
administers to the region. Instead, they argue that what small
nations need is insulation from global financial shocks.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, the Japanese suggested an alternative, a $100
billion Asian Monetary Fund led by Tokyo. The United States
Treasury shot down the proposal, saying it would undermine the
IMF's authority. Revive your own economy first, the Americans told
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   So Japan came up with a more palatable alternative: a $30
billion Miyazawa Plan, which along with other loans, credit
guarantees and contributions means up to $80 billion in financial
assistance from Japan to Asia, more than any other nation has
provided for the region's rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the IMF weakened by accusations that its policies
worsened some countries' plight, Asian officials have renewed calls
for an Asian fund. Many would also like to see Sakakibara take over
from Michel Camdessus, the outgoing managing director of the IMF, a
seat traditionally filled by a European.
</P>
<P>
   Japan continues to advocate an Asian fund, though only as the
IMF's sidekick. ``We don't want to establish a regular organization
that will be seen by the U.S. government as antagonistic to the
international financial order,'' said Hiroshi Hashimoto, Japan's
ambassador to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto, a cousin of Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's sword-fighting
former prime minister, has been busy parrying critics _ including
some from Singapore's government _ who say that Japan has done too
little to help Asia.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Japan has long felt misunderstood and hamstrung
in the region. A pacifist constitution, regionwide mistrust and
American ascendancy relegated Japan to a back-seat role during the
Cold War, silently bankrolling Asia's wobbling dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   The investment brought considerable backlash. Japan acquired a
reputation among some in Southeast Asia as an economic opportunist.
Riots erupted when Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka visited
Jakarta in 1974; thousands of Toyotas burned in the streets as
crowds protested links between Japanese investors and cronies of
Suharto, then the president.
</P>
<P>
   With its enormous trade surplus, Japan has been accused even by
admirers like Mahathir of maintaining a one-sided relationship,
hesitating to hire local managers in its Southeast Asian operations
or to transfer technology.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, critics have accused Japan of tying Miyazawa Plan money
to the purchase of Japanese goods or the payment of Japanese loans.
Hashimoto says most of the aid comes without strings; rather, he
said, the plan demonstrates Japan's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The continued economic influence of Japan is guaranteed to some
extent by the roughly $1.7 billion in development aid it lavishes
on the region every year, not to mention the nearly $100 billion in
annual trade between the two.
</P>
<P>
   And Japan's banks still have potentially huge power: As the
region's biggest lenders, they dominate the committees deciding
what to do when companies stop repaying. But unlike American
bankers, who learned during the Latin American debt crisis that the
fastest path to recovery is to reschedule debt quickly, even if it
means taking losses, the Japanese prefer to dig in, said James
Fiorillo, an analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy has cast them as obstacles to Asia's recovery.
When the Indonesian automaker Astra International told bankers last
August that it needed to reschedule $1 billion in debts, for
example, it took Japanese bankers 11 months to agree to a deal _
and then only after Astra agreed to pay back its loans in full.
``The Japanese have unrealistic expectations,'' said one European
banker who serves with Japanese counterparts on several
restructuring committees.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bankers say they need to be mindful of the $180 billion
in taxpayer money they were given to recapitalize. ``If there's a
way to minimize our loss, we have to do it,'' said Takeuchi of Fuji
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorillo of ING Barings predicted that Japanese banks would
continue to retrench in Asia, in part because they need to fend off
increasing threats at home from the likes of Fidelity Investments
and Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities are opening for Western financiers in Southeast
Asia, too. Citigroup and ABN Amro Holding, the biggest Dutch bank,
are among the handful of Western banks expanding their retail
services in the region. ABN Amro has also been moving its Singapore
staff to offices around Asia to reflect a shift toward borrowing in
local currency instead of in dollars or yen. Western bankers also
dominate another growing business _ advising Southeast Asian
governments and companies how to fix the mess left by the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the private money for rebuilding Asia's
economies is coming not from abroad but rather from a mountain of
domestic savings. When Siam Cement of Thailand, for instance,
decided in April to sell 50 billion baht ($1.3 billion) in bonds to
help pay off $2 billion in foreign debt _ mostly to Japanese banks
_ it sold them to Thai banks and local investors, said Bunn
Kasemsup, the company's assistant corporate treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   That would very likely please Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman, who recently urged Asia to reduce its reliance on
bank lending. Bank loans represent only about 20 percent of assets
in the United States, according to J.P. Morgan; they account for 74
percent of assets in Indonesia and 84 percent in Thailand. A more
developed bond market, economists say, would help bring
transparency to the region and reduce foreign investors' concerns
about Asian risk.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese money will find its way back to Southeast Asia,
economists predict, though the form and the mechanisms may not be
the same. The megamergers seizing Tokyo lately are part of a
revolution in the way Japan's huge savings are invested. In the
future, ``a Japanese bank could be lending to a foreign bank in
Tokyo that ends up lending through Hong Kong to an Asian bank that
ends up lending in Thailand,'' said Kenneth Courtis, an economist
at Deutsche Bank in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Hashimoto, meanwhile, is trying to tap new sources of
Japanese investment for Southeast Asia. In August, he met here in
Singapore with a delegation from small and midsized businesses from
Osaka. He has even suggested that Asian cities try to lure Japan's
growing number of pensioners as long-term visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is not finished,'' Hashimoto said.

LAWMAKERS NOT WORRIED ABOUT Y2K  
 CLINTON AVOIDS FEUD OVER FLAG  
 COUNTING HURRICANE VICTIMS IN NORTH CAROLINA  
 SENATOR WANTS CLEAR POLICY ON CUBAN PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What me, worry?
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hype this past year about the Y2K bug and
widespread computer crashes, most lawmakers don't seem anxious
about the potential for problems come New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   An informal survey of House members and senators found few
making any extraordinary plans to prepare for a bumpy transition
into 2000. No one appears willing to celebrate the new year in a
bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family and I have prepared for Y2K like we would for a
winter storm,'' wrote Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., in a recent
column. ``While we need to prepare for potential Y2K related
disturbances, we need to remember not to panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards warned against senior citizens' falling victim to Y2K
scams, urging them not to give personal information, like credit
card numbers, to strangers over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   As for New Year's Eve, he plans to be in Raleigh with family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Sen. Jeff Session, R-Ala., said his millennium
celebration would be a low-key affair with close friends and family
in Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like things are going to go well, but there might be
some minor problems,'' he said of the potential for computer
glitches.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, computer worries seem to have taken a back seat to the
possibility of terrorist attacks during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   With the State Department issuing warnings for Americans
traveling abroad and local police departments urging citizens to be
cautious in large crowds this season, the threat of attacks has put
something of a damper on the holiday spirit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most officials described themselves as optimistic that
any attacks could be foiled with heightened security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not suggest that people significantly alter their
plans,'' Sessions said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., said the latest warnings about
terrorism threats must be kept in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a concern, but I have more concern about safety in
our schools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NO RENAISSANCE MAN HE
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has a good excuse, but in ducking out on the
wonky annual Renaissance Weekend in South Carolina, he is also
avoiding a ticklish political subject.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady are staying in the White House for
the New Year, hosting millennium events on the mall and monitoring
any Y2K breakdowns or incidents of terrorism. But by skipping the
South Carolina confab, he is staying out of a feud over the state's
display of the Confederate flag. Civil rights groups have suggested
a visitor boycott of the state in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the president's views on the Confederate banner,
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said he has not run the issue up
the flagpole with Clinton. But he confirmed the president would not
be in Hilton Head for an event he almost always attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot going on here,'' Lockhart said of Washington.
``This is obviously a very important milestone the nation will
celebrate, the world will celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   AFTER THE DELUGE
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eva Clayton, D.N.C., wants to make sure victims displaced
by Hurricane Floyd don't suffer again by not being counted in the
2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Their participation is even more vital since federal aid is
distributed on the basis of population and failure to take part in
the census could cut federal funds needed for rebuilding. Many of
those who lost their homes to the storm are minorities, a group
typically under-represented in the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flooding makes the potential for undercounting in eastern
North Carolina even more likely now,'' Clayton said recently.
</P>
<P>
   While the Census Bureau plans a special effort in North
Carolina, Clayton urged the bureau to be more aggressive in
reaching out to flood victims. She called for community involvement
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort must be broad and comprehensive,'' she said. ``Much
is at stake for us.''
</P>
<P>
   TAKE NO PRISONERS
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., wants no repeat of the recent hostage
standoff in a St. Martin, La., parish prison involving Cubans
awaiting deportation after serving criminal sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux called on the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings
next year on what to do about 2,400 Cubans remaining in other U.S.
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not right that American taxpayers should continue paying
to feed, house and provide medical care to Cubans who have served
their time for their crimes,'' said Breaux. ``It's time to send
them home.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said that a clearly articulated policy would deter others
from rioting in prisons in an attempt to force the issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The pre-Christmas buying spree that drove the Nasdaq briefly to
the 4000 market Thursday made telecommunications and high-tech
stocks the big winners. But it was also a big week for
biotechnology companies.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Genome Therapeutics Inc. of Waltham, Mass., say its
shares reach record highs amid optimism about breakthrough
medications.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Amgen Inc. and Genentech Inc., the world's two largest
biotech companies, hit records and led the group higher. The
American Stock Exchange Biotech Index climbed 19 percent during the
week, outperforming gains in the broader Dow Jones industrial
average and the technology-laden Nasdaq index.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Biogen Inc. saw its shares soar to 81 3/4 on Thursday,
up nearly 13 points since Monday. Shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Inc. also soared nearly six points last week closing at 33, while
Alkermes Inc. stock reached its 52-week high of 53 5/8, up more
than five points since last Friday. All three are based in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the whole biotech universe, it's just exploded
in the last 10 days,'' said Marie Warburg, a fund manager with BB
Biotech, one of this year's best-performing biotech funds.
</P>
<P>
   She and other analysts say investors who profited from Internet
investments are moving money into biotechnology shares to catch the
next big boom. They have chosen companies that have made
breakthroughs in their drug discovery efforts, along with companies
such as Genome Therapeutics that use genetic information to help
big pharmaceutical companies develop new medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Genome Therapeutics, one of the nation's oldest
biotechnology-turned-genomics companies, saw its stock reach an
all-time high of 17 3/16 during the week _ more than four times its
price of 4 1/8 on Dec. 1. The surge follows a series of alliances,
milestone payments, and management changes that began in early
December.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which uses proprietary genetic databases to guide
drug development efforts for big pharmaceutical companies, this
week announced a potential $118 million agreement with Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories, the pharmaceutical division of American Home Products
Corp., to develop treatment for the bone-thinning disorder
osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   That deal _ the largest in Genome Therapeutic's 38-year history
_ came two days after the company announced it had reached a
critical milestone in the development of a potential drug to treat
asthma for Schering-Plough Corp. The large Madison, N.J.-based drug
maker, a leading supplier of asthma medication, also has similar
research deals with Genome Therapeutics for antibiotic-based drugs
and antifungal treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The Schering-Plough and Wyeth-Ayerst deals, along with the Dec.
16 announcement that Richard D. Gill, an intellectual property
rights specialist, will become president of Genome Therapeutics
Jan. 3, convinced Wall Street that the 190-employee company was
making important strides in its development. Gill succeeds Robert
Hennessey, who will remain chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect announcements of further scientific and commercial
achievements, new partnerships and progress in established
partnerships . . . to raise Genome Therapeutics' profile with
investors over the next few months,'' noted Matt Geller,
biotechnology analyst at CIBC World Markets in New York, after the
company announced it had received the Schering-Plough milestone
payment.
</P>
<P>
   Genome Therapeutics, which originally was formed as
Collaborative Research in 1961 and changed its name nearly seven
years ago, competes for customers with its bigger genomics
competitor Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies, along with Lynx Therapeutics Inc., which
develops technologies for cloning and studying DNA, and Incyte
Pharmaceuticals Inc., both based in California, have seen their
shares rise this month over investor enthusiasm in genomics.

ALTERNATIVE RELIGIONS AS A GROWTH INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   National polls report that 19 in 20 Americans affirm a belief in
God, and 4 in 10 claim to attend religious services regularly. But
aside from revealing that religiosity runs higher in the United
States than in most other economically developed nations, these
polls don't say much about what people actually believe.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of scholars have begun to fill in the gap,
however, working in an unconventional academic specialty they call
new religious movements. This emerging field has not only attracted
traditional religion experts but also psychologists,
anthropologists and literary critics. It has even brought forth a
separate study group within the American Academy of Religion called
the New Religious Movements Group, for scholars interested in the
topic.
</P>
<P>
   The new field covers a broad band of beliefs and organizations
outside the more familiar Christian and Jewish institutions,
ranging from the exotic (spiritually oriented UFO devotees) to the
well-established (the Bahais), from the marginal and tragic (the
suicidal Heaven's Gate group) to the large and upbeat (the
evangelical Promise Keepers men's movement).
</P>
<P>
   It is ``a growth industry in the academy,'' said Phillip C.
Lucas, an associate professor of religious studies at Stetson
University in De Land, Fla. Lucas considers this an era of intense
religious activity. Technology, especially the Internet and the
ease of airline travel, has reduced both time and space, he
explained, allowing people a wider access to beliefs and religious
systems. (``So we can learn about Tibetan Buddhism, Shintoism or
feng shui by surfing the Net,'' he said.) ``One of the fascinating
things about being a student of this field is there really is a
paradigm shift going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Although new faiths are often summarily dismissed, yesterday's
new religion may be today's powerhouse. Consider the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Mormons, which began with a
handful of people in an upstate New York village in 1830 and now
counts more than 10 million members worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   William Ashcraft, a professor of religious studies at Truman
State University in Kirksville, Mo., said that most new-faith
adherents see themselves as set apart from the surrounding culture.
``Scholars have come to think of these groups as anybody who is
alternative to the mainstream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Brasher, assistant professor of religion at Mount Union
College in Alliance, Ohio, said, ``I even put the Promise Keepers
under that heading as a new religious movement, because it
literally is, it emerged in the 90s. Even though it's out of a
dominant tradition, the movement itself is new.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcraft and Ms. Basher are coordinators of the New Religious
Movements Group, which has held sessions on Christian Science, New
Age beliefs, goddess worship, the Hare Krishnas, the Rev. Sun Myung
Moon's Unification Church, new Hasidic groups, conversion, women's
roles and attitudes toward violence.
</P>
<P>
   Like most experts, however, they don't use the word cult.
``Practically every religion we know of is labeled a cult in some
country,'' Ms. Brasher said.
</P>
<P>
   These scholars say it is not possible to tell the full history
of American religion by focusing solely on Protestant churches,
Roman Catholicism and the main branches of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the rise of new religious groups, the black Muslims
for example, reflects tensions in society at large, resulting in
pressures that make many people more receptive to ideas outside the
established faiths.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, home to an ethnically diverse population and
the idea that a person can always begin again, has gone through
spurts of new religious activity. One occurred in the second
quarter of the 19th century after the Revolutionary War generation
had died and new technologies like canals and railroads were
reshaping American life.
</P>
<P>
   The era included the heyday of the Shakers, a group then
regarded as heretical because members believed Christ would take a
female form at the second coming. That period also saw an surge in
evangelical activity, the establishment of communes like Brook Farm
in Massachusetts and the Oneida community in New York, and the rise
and collapse of a movement around William Miller, a Bible student
who repeatedly predicted the world's end in 1843-44.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the cultural upheavals of the 1960s helped
diminish the social taboos ageligious experimentation. As
Lucas explained, ``There is far less stigma attached to searching
outside the mainstream when it comes to one's own religion.''
</P>
<P>
   And today, new technologies are once again causing upheavals in
American life. ``I do think it's easier to be involved in a new
religious movement now because of the Internet,'' Ms. Brasher said.
``Geography is no longer destiny. It's easier for small religious
groups to form. They've got a medium through which they can
encourage each other.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Scholars whose research puts them in contact with new faiths can
share their work in a new journal, Nova Religio: The Journal of
Alternative and Emergent Religions, which is edited by Lucas. The
current issue has five articles on the relationship between
scholars of new religions and law enforcement agents. One discusses
how scholars warned the FBI &UR;  &LR; not to exert heavy pressure on a group
called the Freemen during its three-month standoff with federal
agents in Montana in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advised that it would be counterproductive to take
aggressive action against an apocalyptic group'' that was
``expecting conflict,'' writes Catherine Wessinger, a professor at
Loyola University in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff ended peacefully, in contrast to the fiasco that
ended the clash between the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, and
agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts point out that new religions vary widely, they
do concede that those bitterly hostile to society have a potential
for violence, like Aum Shinrikyo, the Japanese group that used
poison gas in the Tokyo subway, or Jim Jones' People's Temple,
which engaged in a mass suicide in the jungles of Guyana. They
argue that a better understanding of these groups' beliefs may help
government agencies deal peacefully with them, avoiding encounters
that can lead to loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   But containing violence isn't the only motive for the
fascination with new religious movements. Many scholars argue that
these groups are often the purveyors of more widely accepted ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the alternative religions of today,'' Ms. Brasher said,
``could be our habits and cultures of tomorrow. Some of those are
very exciting and some of those are quite scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oneida community, for example, pioneered the concept of
equality in work between men and women, and the Seventh-day
Adventists pushed the case for healthier diets.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a more modern instance, Lucas credited a small group, the
Holy Order of MANS (which has since become affiliated with the
Eastern Orthodox churches) with establishing shelters for victims
of domestic violence in the early 1970s, before the idea caught on
widely. He added that new religious movements in general had long
provided more openings for women to be leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And Ashcraft said the Shakers made a case for celibacy as an
alternative at a time when the dominant Protestant culture viewed
marriage and family as an imperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion is the expression of humanity trying to make sense of
the world,'' Ashcraft said. ``I guess to me that's the reason I'm
interested in new religions. I'm interested in how it is that
people coming out of the same social context as the rest of us
march to the beat of a different drummer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it indicate the way we might be going?'' he asked.
``Because often these groups are trendsetters.''

THIS CHOICE OF HILLARY'S MAKES SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, Dec. 30.)  
(lh) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's so hard to get about Hillary choosing New York over
Washington? The air is fresher. Her New York house, while grand, is
almost cozy next to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Why not excuse herself early? The first lady thrill has been
gone for a while. She's put in seven years. So what's a few months
without her undivided attention, considering how much time the
president, himself, has allowed for distractions. Besides, no one's
paying much attention to the current tenants anyhow. It's all about
who moves in next January.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone had reason to look forward to a brand new century, it
has to be this woman. It is time to walk into her own house and
close the door, get into her sweatshirt and pajama bottoms and
crank up the music.
</P>
<P>
   I like that image of her. It perpetuates the way Emma Thompson
played her in ``Primary Colors.'' No crushed woman, making weepy
calls to friends at 3 in the morning. That's over. End of chapter.
She has a new life.
</P>
<P>
   Not to presume anything about the status of the first ovaries,
but Hillary seems to be displaying what some women know as
post-menopausal zest. Hillary, who has been an inspiration to many
women for how she juggles her multiple roles as deftly as she
coordinates a headband with a pearl necklace is now playing out a
middle age fantasy. That is, to make an about-face, do something
completely different. A lot of women describe it as ``my turn.''
</P>
<P>
   While others may happily lack the motivation of wanting to
distance themselves from a man who made them feel like dog meat
around the world, they can relate to suddenly thinking, ``I'll
study Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hillary it's politics, which she can do in the very nice
state of New York where the weather is better than in Washington
and the lights are brighter than Arkansas. For another woman it's
quitting her teaching job to become a white water guide. For
Hillary it's butting heads with an old pol who sputters that she's
a carpetbagger.
</P>
<P>
   I know a woman a little older than Hillary who decided to take
up the bass fiddle just because its sound fascinated her, and she
practiced enough that one night her singer-friend called her up
from the audience to play with her band. I imagine taking on a
blowhard mayor of New York requires the same kind of courage needed
to walk on stage in an Irish saloon and make your musical debut.
</P>
<P>
   Why not take an early out from D.C.? Chelsea seems willing to
fill in at the occasional White House dinner, and we know from
watching ``The West Wing'' that nobody gets much personal time
anyhow, so what's she going to miss?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary actually looks as if she's having more fun these days,
even when they jump on her for being too much a Yankee fan or too
kissy with Suha Arafat. Embarrassing moments to be sure, but at
least they're her personal blunders, not his.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary has her champion moments too. She's allegiant to health
care and the poor, two issues that fell out of favor with her
husband's administrations even as homeless wanderers spread from
the cities to the suburbs and health care worries turned into a
crisis. Turned-off Hillary fans, of whom I know a few, got back on
board when she stood up this month for the homeless mentally ill
and then for gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   She's the first first lady to have a career and the first to be
hounded for it. It's going to feel good to start making her own
money again, and if she doesn't make it to the U.S. Senate this
time she can try another time. We know the woman does not give up
easily.
</P>
<P>
   A Hillary biographer says that Hillary is a century ahead of her
time. Let's hope not. She may not have been a cookie-baker but she
knows enough about the kitchen to know when to get out.

ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS CREDITED FOR 3-DAY TRUCE IN SOUTH LEBANON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli troops and Lebanese guerrillas fighting in
southern Lebanon observed a rare and unannounced three-day
cease-fire that ended Friday, allowing the recovery of the bodies
of five guerrillas killed in the area in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The lull was widely seen as a product of last week's resumption
of negotiations between Israel and Syria, which supports the
Iranian-backed guerrillas of Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Although artillery exchanges resumed Friday, the cease-fire was
described by spokesmen for United Nations forces as the the
quietest period in southern Lebanon in more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross workers assisted by U.N. soldiers recovered five
bodies in the Israeli-controlled area of southern Lebanon during
the cease-fire, which quietly went into effect Tuesday morning. It
ended Friday when the guerrillas shelled positions of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire was the second time that the fighting in southern
Lebanon has been curbed since the renewal of the Israeli-Syrian
talks, which are scheduled to resume Jan. 3. Last Thursday,
Hezbollah departed from its usual practice, refraining from firing
rockets into northern Israel in retaliation for the wounding of 15
Lebanese children in a schoolyard shelled by the South Lebanon
Army.
</P>
<P>
   Supplied and trained by Iran, Hezbollah is fighting the Israelis
with the support of Syria, which is the main power broker in
Lebanon and has thousands of it own troops in the country. The
guerrillas seek to oust the Israelis from a nine-mile deep strip of
south Lebanese territory that Israel says it is holding as a buffer
zone against cross-border attacks. The zone was carved out in 1985,
and is controlled by Israeli forces and its Lebanese allies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said the request
for the cease-fire, arranged by a five-nation group monitoring
events in southern Lebanon, had been made by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the atmosphere of the resumption of talks made the
conditions for a cease-fire more favorable,'' Sneh said. ``This
shows that a cease-fire in southern Lebanon is feasible, but the
interests of Hezbollah do not necessary correspond with Syrian
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have expressed hope that negotiations with
Syria, as well as planned talks with Lebanon, will produce an
agreement that will allow the withdrawal of Israeli forces from
southern Lebanon. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has vowed to
bring the troops home by July.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office said Friday that he would head a five-man
steering committee that had been appointed for the talks with
Lebanon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even as he prepared for next round of talks with Syria and
Lebanon, Barak sent a message that he was not about to make any
immediate changes on the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is demanding a return of the land as part of a peace
agreement. But Barak's office said Friday that he had given the
go-ahead for the construction of 70 more housing units at two
Israeli settlements in the Golan Heights: Katzrin and Bnei Yehuda.
A spokeswoman for Barak said that he had confirmed existing
construction plans, and that as long as there was no deal with
Syria, the plans were likely to proceed.

ASTRONOMERS SEEK ELUSIVE EARTH-LIKE PLANETS

<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ If there are other planets like Earth in our
galaxy, a team of University of Florida astronomers may have found
a way to divine them in the glowing dust that rings newborn stars.
</P>
<P>
   Their findings were published this week in The Astrophysical
Journal, a leading international astronomy journal.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists have discovered 27 planets to date using
other means, those methods are only good for finding huge planets
that tend to be gaseous and uninhabitable, said Scott Fisher, a UF
graduate student. For example, astronomers have observed that some
stars seem to dim as large orbiting planets pass in front of them.
Another method, called the ``wobble method'' detects planets so
large that parent stars are disturbed by the gravitational pull of
the planets' orbits.
</P>
<P>
   But detecting the presence of smaller, rocky planets like the
Earth has been more elusive, said Mark Wyatt, who graduated last
week from UF with a doctorate in astronomy and was the lead
researcher on the UF team.
</P>
<P>
   If life did exist on other planets, Wyatt said, it would most
likely be found on a terrestrial planet like the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   He said observations of a young star in the constellation
Centaurus led the researchers to propose the new method. Unlike
most stars of its age, HR 4796 has a donut shaped ring of dust
particles orbiting it, which may or may not be left over from when
the star formed. The researchers noticed that one side of the
``donut'' was glowing more brightly than the other, leading them to
believe the gravitational pull of an unseen planet may have shifted
the dust cloud off-center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the center of the donut is offset, one side is closer
to the star, so that side is hotter and brighter,'' Wyatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Because HR4796 is part of a binary or two-star system, it is
possible the companion star is shifting the dust ring as well,
Wyatt said. More detailed observation will be needed to confirm the
existence of the planet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most exciting part was when we worked out, with computer
modeling, that the size of the planet would only have to be 10
earth masses,'' Wyatt said, ``which is much smaller than all
previous methods.''
</P>
<P>
   The wobble method, by comparison, only detects planets at least
the size of Jupiter, or about 300 times larger than Earth. The
``dust-disk'' method is also different in that it can detect
planets much farther away from stars, Wyatt said.
</P>
<P>
   The HR 4796 planet could be as far away as 50 ``astronomical
units'' from its star, said Stanley Dermott, professor and chairman
of the UF department of astronomy. One astronomical unit, the
distance between the Earth and the sun, equals about 92.7 million
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Dermott was among the members of a joint UF-Harvard team that
last year announced the discovery of the dust disk around HR 4796
and its companion star. The astronomers said the disk, the first to
be discovered in a binary star system, had the right conditions to
be forming planets.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt, who spent three years on the research for his
dissertation, was supported in part by a Fulbright Scholarship. He
also received NASA funds provided to Dermott for work on the
dynamics of dust in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the research team are Dermott, Fisher,
Charles Telesco, a UF astronomy professor; Keith Grogan, a UF
postdoctoral research associate; and Robert Pina, a UF assistant
professor of astronomy.

OF MOUSE AND MAN: REBIRTH OF STUART LITTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ M. Night Shyamalan was sitting in a rest stop
restaurant on the New Jersey Turnpike having something to eat and
watching CNN on one of the television sets that give travelers
something to stare at while they chew.
</P>
<P>
   ``A story came on about this little boy who had ears so big that
his parents used to tape them back and how traumatic it all was for
him,'' said (pronounced shy-ah-MELL-inn). He stopped chewing. He
thought about it. And while he didn't shout ``Eureka!'' there was
an immediate sense of happy discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Shyamalan, who has since become famous as the writer and
director of ``The Sixth Sense,'' one of 1999s biggest box office
successes, was at the time an ambitious screenwriter hard at work
on finding a way to translate E.B. White's classic children's tale,
``Stuart Little,'' to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The task had thus far stymied Shyamalan, as it had other
screenwriters who had taken a stab at adapting White's picaresque
tale of a mouse-child's adventures in the larger world. ``I
thought, hey, we could make this a movie about a person who doesn't
belong, who doesn't feel like they fit in,'' said Shyamalan, who
lives in a suburb of Philadelphia. ``I felt all kids could relate
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, but especially during the holiday season, when
Hollywood turns out most of its prestige, Oscar-yearning movies, a
significant percentage of which are almost always based on classic
books and recent best sellers, screenwriters like Shyamalan are
faced with figuring out how to translate the printed word into
images and sounds. In some cases, like ``Stuart Little,'' it is a
particularly difficult process because the work does not easily fit
into the fast-paced, neat-and-clean, an-arc-for-every-character
constraints of the mainstream Hollywood film.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Jordan, who transformed Graham Greene's most
autobiographical novel, ``The End of the Affair,'' into a bitter
romance starring Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore, was able to
follow the general structure of the novel. But he said he felt he
needed to shoot several of the crucial scenes more than once to
show them from the sometimes conflicting perspectives of the main
characters. ``My approach to the entire story was that none of
these characters actually knows the real truth of the pivotal
events,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Petersen, who has just completed principal photography
on his adaptation of ``The Perfect Storm,'' a best-selling sea
tragedy set off the New England coast, had an even more difficult
task. As the author, Sebastian Junger, acknowledges in the book, no
one can know what actually happened on the boat that is the story's
main setting, as none of the occupants survived the storm. So the
author offers the range of things that might have happened and then
indicates which he thinks was the most likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we are not able to do that,'' Peterson said of the
film, that which is to be released next summer. So each time the
book's author allowed uncertainty to creep into the narrative,
Peterson said, the filmmakers had to guess what made the most sense
to them, factually and dramatically. Did the lead character, the
boat's captain, played by George Clooney, twist the arms of his
shipmates to try to plow through the deadly storm or did he lay out
the facts and leave it up to majority vote? No one knows, beyond an
educated guess. In the screenplay, though, the captain and crew
make the fateful decision collaboratively. ``It's the nature of
movies,'' Peterson said. ``We had to make a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   That's always the nub of it: the choice.
</P>
<P>
   The choices that the filmmakers behind ``Stuart Little'' say
they were forced to make jettisoned much of White's story,
transformed almost all of the essential remaining scenes and
imposed characters and emotional crises on characters who are
little more than  in White's book, if they exist at all.
</P>
<P>
   White's ``Stuart Little'' is the story of a ``mouse-child'' who
is born into the Little family in an idealized New York City of
parks and intelligent animals. Some of Stuart's adventures in the
book, including a miniature sailboat race in Central Park, are
carried over to the film, but the context is entirely different; in
the film, the race is a bonding moment for Stuart and his brother,
George, while in the book George is a minor character who is not
even present for the boat race. And while the book's final third
sees Stuart leave home without a backward glance to find the
beautiful bird he loves, in the film the bird does not appear and
the story becomes a paean to family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I originally did a draft that was basically a faithful version
of the book,'' Shyamalan said. ``The general response from the
studio and everybody was, wow, it's so literate, but it's an
independent movie starring a mouse. So I decided I needed to be
more broad with it, to keep with the spirit but be more
contemporary.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At first, he said, he was daunted by the idea of adapting a book
that so many adults remember affectionately from childhood, until
he talked to a lot of people and came to believe that people didn't
really remember the book all that clearly. ``What I realized over
time is that everybody, everybody has mythologized the book,''
Shyamalan said. ``But it's not what they think it was. The book was
so fragmented and I think people filled in the gaps in their
imaginations over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   It was this fragmentation that posed the greatest dramatic
hurdle. ``Part of the problem was, the book was very episodic,''
said Douglas Wick, one of the film's producers. ``It was designed
to be read in installments to children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Minkoff, one of the directors of Disney's ``Lion King,'' was
given the task of mixing live action with the computer-generated
image of Stuart, whose voice is provided by Michael J. Fox. ``The
problem is that the book is not like `Charlotte's Web,' '' Minkoff
said of White's best-known children's tale. ``That one really is a
novel. With Stuart, every chapter is its own story.''
</P>
<P>
   The main dramatic shortcoming, as far as a film adaptation is
concerned, the filmmakers said, is that while the character of
Stuart has a very definite voice and personality in White's story,
neither he nor any of the other characters go on a neatly defined
emotional journey that connects the book into a satisfying whole.
That had to be imposed on the story, they argued, and the defining
moment for Shyamalan came at that turnpike rest stop.
</P>
<P>
   First, the decision was made to make Stuart not a
``mouse-child'' who is literally born into the Little family, but
an actual mouse who lives in a New York orphanage and is adopted by
the Littles, who admire Stuart's pluck and see nothing odd about
bringing a mouse into their family. All the other changes made in
White's story are an outgrowth of that change. The emotional
connective tissue of the story, about Stuart's efforts to fit in
with his adoptive family, were born from that report about the boy
with the ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I write a script I ask myself, what fairy tale is
this?'' Shyamalan said. ``What myth is this fairy tale about? In
this case, it's the adoption myth, the orphan being adopted, like
Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Pascal, chairwoman of Columbia Pictures, which released the
movie on Dec. 17, said the result was ``in the same spirit as the
book but in a more movie-friendly story.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort appeared to be connecting with audiences. The movie,
which cost about $100 million, was in first place at the box office
in its opening weekend. It earned more than $15 million, a figure
which augurs well for the film surpassing $100 million at the
domestic box office, said Ed Russell, a spokesman for the studio.
He said Columbia is hoping that Stuart will be a recurring
character for the studio, with more films, television shows,
merchandising and other commercial outlets featuring him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little is a franchise character for this studio,'' Ms.
Pascal said. ``We have more uses for Stuart beyond this movie.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tranquil weather will cover the nation on the last Christmas Day
of the millennium as a fast northwest-to-southeast jet stream flow
limits the influx of moist air from Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf of
Mexico. Winter chill will grip the Eastern Seaboard as breezes from
the northwest import Canadian air southward. Despite abundant sun,
daytime readings will hold in the 20s from Philadelphia to Boston.
Meanwhile, for the first time this season, the mercury will fail to
reach 70 degrees Saturday afternoon at Miami. The threat for a
killing freeze will be high across northern Florida Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening breezes from the southwest will direct milder air
into the Midwest and western Great Lakes. Sunshine amid patches of
clouds will cover the region. A few snow flurries will persist near
Lakes Erie and Ontario as winds gather moisture in transit across
the unfrozen waters. Little if any accumulations will occur,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty breezes from the northwest warming on descent from the
Rockies will propel temperatures to much above normal levels from
central Montana to eastern Colorado. A stationary high-altitude
low-pressure system near New Mexico will cause overcast skies from
eastern Arizona to southwestern Texas. Scattered light showers will
occur beneath the clouds with some snow in New Mexico's San Juan
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Formidable high pressure will continue to sponsor dry weather
along the West Coast. California will be sunny, as warm, gusty
winds buffet southern areas. Farther north, fog will limit
visibility in much of interior Washington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Alaskan Chinook
</P>
<P>
   The word ``Chinook'' is an American Indian word that refers to
winds that warm on descent from mountain ranges, causing snow to
quickly melt and evaporate on their downwind sides. These chinook
or ``snow eater'' winds often occur east of the North American
Rockies. But during Wednesday, an Alaskan chinook gusting to 80 mph
careened down the northern slopes of the Alaskan Range, an
east-to-west horseshoe which houses Mt. McKinley. The Alaskan
version of a chinook caused snow to change to freezing rain and
rain in some areas north of the Alaskan Range.

As the holiday shopping season drew to a close Friday, sales were
coming in higher than even the most optimistic expectations.
<P>
   ``This was the strongest season in recent memory,'' said John
Konarski, senior vice president of research for the International
Council of Shopping Centers.
</P>
<P>
   Konarski had forecast a 4 to 6 percent increase in holiday sales
this year while other predictions ranged as high as 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be little bit higher'' than 6.5 percent,
thanks to the booming economy in the Bay Area and across the
country, Konarski said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at Kepler's Books and Magazines in Menlo Park are up 11
percent compared with last Christmas _ and shopper insanity in
Silicon Valley is up, too, said manager Karen Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are so fatigued they're sucking their thumbs and laying
on the floor while their moms are in linnnington said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a well-heeled shopper ordered and paid for a book
over her car phone and asked Pennington to meet her in the parking
lot with the wrapped gift and a card.
</P>
<P>
   ``She slowed down as I passed it to her through the passenger
window,'' Pennington said. ``She said `Merry Christmas' and voom,
off she went.''
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce traffic slowed significantly by Christmas Eve _ in
fact, Web shopping has been on the wane since mid-December due to
shopper fears of late deliveries and shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic to gift sites, for example, jumped 32.5 percent between
December 5 and December 12 but then declined 20.9 percent the
following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected (e-commerce sales) to continue to rise until a
week before Christmas, with people taking advantage of quick-ship
programs,'' said Tim Meadows, vice president at NetRatings, a firm
that tracks Web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``People are cautious about waiting till the last
minute and taking the chance that merchandise isn't available,'' he
said. ``The challenge for online merchants next holiday season is
how to build a reputation for dependability.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, e-shopping got started earlier than expected,
with Net traffic starting to grow immediately after Halloween.
Meadows attributed most of the early bump to toy shoppers looking
for this season's hot items, such as Pokemon games, before they
sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Web sales are expected to double this year, but still remain
less than 2 percent of general merchandise sales.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Eve sales for Macy's West were up about 15 percent
compared with last year, said Jeremiah Sullivan, president.
Millennium-themed champagne flutes, dressy clothes, power beads and
fluffy slippers have been among the most popular items this year,
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   For the season as a whole, sales at Macy's West stores are
running about two percentage points higher than expected and will
tally a mid-single digit increase over the 1998 holiday season,
Sullivan said yesterday. He declined to give specific numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's flagship Union Square store, which finished a
remodel this year, is seeing double-digit increases compared with
to  &LR; 1998, Sullivan said. Sales at Macys.com, meanwhile are up 300
to 400 percent this holiday.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Friday, the Hearthsong educational toy store in
Berkeley was ``nutty'' and packed with shoppers, said assistant
manager Sanjay Kumar.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our science kits, games, puzzles, anything in the store
has been selling well,'' Kumar said. ``Every item at one time or
other has been sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales at jewelry and home-entertainment stores have been
particularly strong this year, with both rising 10 percent or
greater, according to an International Council of Shopping Centers
poll of mall speciality stores.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel sales have also been strong, with weekly increases since
Thanksgiving ranging from 4.3 percent to 7.2 percent, according to
the council.

Getting your new Christmas computer to blast out the sounds of

<P>
   Solving a problem with your new PC or gizmo could entail hours

though much of the world is on holiday today, several phone-in and
online help desks are staffed and standing by to answer consumers'

</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of, `I just got a computer, but I don't know how
to run this thing,''' said Loc Ha, a help desk technician with the
new online help site Sykes AnswerTeam.com
</P>
<P>
   The AnswerTeam, a 24-hour service based in Tampa, Fla., is one
of several technical help sources available on the Internet this
Christmas to assist frustrated people who can't get that new
computer, DVD player, digital camera, handheld device or other
high-tech toy to work.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the services offer more than just prepackaged FAQs;
users can e-mail specific questions and real people will send
answers. Ha said that for complicated questions, he will walk users
through the problem by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Prices can range from free to $15 per call.
</P>
<P>
   Technical help is just a mouse click away from independent sites
like San Francisco's Cnet Inc., which has launched a service called
Help.com, or Sunnyvale's NoWonder Inc. Manufacturers like Dell
Computer Corp. and Palm Computing also have phone and online help
available today.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a site called Tech Support Guy, where the motto is,
``There's no such thing as a stupid question, but they're the
easiest to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most basic one I got so far is the lady who forgot to turn
off the power on her computer and just turned off the power on her
monitor,'' Ha said.
</P>
<P>
   When she switched the monitor back on, she couldn't understand
why the computer was displaying a message that it was shutting
down, Ha said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a dumb question, but a lot of peopjust not
informed about what's going on,'' Ha said.
</P>
<P>
   And if the help desk still can't get that new electronic toy to
work, you could swap it for a surfboard, a collectible watch or
other item listed on a new site,  &LR; www.Intellibarter &LR;   &LR; .com &LR; , which
officially launches Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Intellibarter, a Santa Cruz startup, allows users to trade a
product straight up for another product without cash. The company
decided to launch today to draw people who received gifts they
don't want, but don't want to battle long lines at store return
counters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you received something that's not your cup of tea or
maybe you got five wallets, so you want to find out what you can
get for that item in trade,'' said Intellibarter founder Patrick
Tao.

   CAIRO, Egypt _ When the Egyptian government put the national
beer company up for sale a few years ago, nobody was buying.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the brewery had no competition and had been steadily
turning a profit, it was a management nightmare. Workers lounged
around reading newspapers or napping while grimy, ancient machines
gushed foaming beer into dirty green bottles, often along with
insects, twigs and clumps of dirt. Sales were falling. And, as if
all that were not enough of a headache, beer drinking for many
people in Egypt, a predominantly Muslim country, is considered a
sin.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmed Zayat, an Egyptian entrepreneur who had earned degrees
at Harvard and Boston University and flourished at Wall Street
firms specializing in real estate and leveraged buyouts, spotted
potential where others saw only pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years after taking control of Al Ahram Beverages
Co. _ which required some inventive negotiating and a high-flying
stock offering on the London Stock Exchange _ Zayat, 37, has turned
the bedraggled enterprise into one of the best-performing companies
in Egypt. With the help of consultants from Carlsberg, the Danish
brewer, he has begun turning out first-rate beer. Moreover, Al
Ahram has gained enough respectability that early next year it will
also begin producing Carlsberg and Guinness beers.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, he has discovered that the real profit may be in a
line of nonalcoholic beers _ some with apple, lemon and strawberry
flavors _ that have been flying off the shelves. ``It tastes like
beer,'' said Fatenn Mostafa, the director of marketing whom Zayat
hired away from PepsiCo, ``and it's a little naughty.''
</P>
<P>
   While expanding sales across Egypt with a blitz of television
advertising, an army of sales representatives and a fleet of trucks
that provide home delivery _ all new tactics here _ Zayat has begun
exporting nonalcoholic beer to Saudi Arabia and is gearing up to
move into other Middle East, African and Asian countries,
particularly places like Nigeria and Indonesia with big Muslim
populations. Sales revenues jumped 60 percent in the last fiscal
year ended June 30, and profits rose nearly 30 percent, to $26
million.
</P>
<P>
   Zayat's success has been a catalyst for a new wave of investment
in Egypt. The beer company was just one of more than 300
state-owned companies that the government had been hoping to sell
as Egypt took the lead in a shift across the Middle East from
top-down control and state ownership to the more freewheeling style
of capitalism. For most investors and investment bankers, the
universally troubled companies had been a yawn. But when they saw
what Zayat was able to do with Al Ahram, they began searching for
other diamonds in the rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a model for other investors,'' said Josse Dorra
Fiani, the president of Fiani &AMP; Partners, a Cairo consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Before Zayat closed his deal in early 1997, five state-owned
companies had been sold since the privatization push began in the
early 1990s. Now the number is 18, with two state-owned cement
companies bought by corporations in Mexico and Britain in recent
weeks. Government officials say more than a dozen other deals are
in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a different attitude,'' said Mokhtar Khattab, an
undersecretary in the Ministry of Public Enterprise, the
clearinghouse for the sale of state-owned companies. He added,
however, that he thought some of the new enthusiasm was the
cumulative effect of years of government effort.
</P>
<P>
   Zayat, puffing on a Cuban cigar late one evening in his office
at the brewery, said that investors who passed up a chance to buy
the company ``totally misunderstood the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   He managed to take over the brewery for about $70 million, only
about one-third the government's asking price. That so angered some
government officials that they still find it hard to applaud his
achievements. But it demonstrated to investors that Cairo could be
flexible _ something many had doubted. And he has shown the
government that the sale price is only one part of a successful
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Besides helping to attract other investors, Zayat has fulfilled
several other goals of the government's privatization program. He
has begun contributing to Egypt's export earnings and he has
inspired a group of local investors to start a new beer company,
creating competition and new jobs in a country with unemployment of
around 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When a third beer company was about to start up, Zayat, whose
company has an overwhelming share of the domestic market, concluded
that too much competition too soon might not be good. So he bought
out the fledgling company as part of his expansion.
</P>
<P>
   To get started in the wine business, he went back to the
government and bought its small winemaker, taking another company
out of the state's inventory. Zayat, whose company already sells
soft drinks, said he plans to introduce vodka, Scotch and other
hard liquors, aimed at Egypt's tourist trade and its growing
population of affluent, foreign-educated young people.
</P>
<P>
   No one would have predicted such success. There was so little
interest among big investors in Egypt's state-owned companies that
the government sold more than 80 of them piecemeal on the Cairo
stock exchange. Out of frustration, it liquidated nearly 30 other
companies it deemed unsalable.
</P>
<P>
   When no investor was willing to buy the beer company, the
government turned to the local stock market. But the brewery's
reputation was so bad and so many local investors were reluctant to
add a ``sin stock'' to their portfolios that the government cut
back an initial public offering in mid-1996 to 5 percent of the
company, and settled for an offering price of $4.925 a share
adjusted for a recent stock split, rather than a hoped-for $6.25.
It sold two other similarly sized blocks of the company to two big
Egyptian institutional investors and gave another 10 percent to
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The poor reception in the local stock market helped Zayat talk
down the price for the remaining 75 percent. His real estate
experience helped him, too. The government wanted nearly $200
million in exchange for the stake, in part because the main plant,
more than 100 years old and looking like a crusader's castle, sits
on some of Cairo's most valuable real estate, near the center of
town and just across the street from Cairo University.
</P>
<P>
   But Zayat wanted to buy a business, not invest in real estate.
So he proposed that the government keep the land, but lease it to
him for five years. In the meantime, he would build a $50 million
advanced brewery like nothing the Middle East had ever seen, in the
desert on the outskirts of Cairo. He bought the land at below
market price as one of the anchor developers in a new industrial
village the government was starting. As part of the package, Zayat
negotiated a 10-year tax holiday on the new plant.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996, the government finally accepted a bid from
Zayat of $5.51 a share, adjusted for the split, or 11 percent more
than the disappointing offering price on the Cairo exchange. On
Friday the stock closed at $19.85 a share.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Reaching his goal took 18 months and 22 negotiating sessions.
Zayat's meetings with platoons of government officials often ran
more than 12 hours. ``One time,'' he said, ``I spoke 16 hours and
ended up with everybody in the room asleep but me and the person I
was talking to.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the government said yes there was still a problem:
Zayat did not yet have $70 million. He had to sell the idea of
selling beer to Muslims to international investors. He lined up a
public offering of global depository receipts in Europe and set off
on a road show across Europe and the United States that yielded
Zayat not only enough money to pay the government but even more to
pocket himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the people in the government are still asking, `If he did
it, couldn't we have done it?''' said Daniel Kurtzer, the American
ambassador to Egypt. Zayat paid his bankers and lawyers $10 million
and came away with $25 million in instant profit for himself and a
handful of American backers. And after all the financial wizardry,
Zayat and his backers wound up with a 12 percent stake in the
company.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zayat has taken a creative approach to running his business as
well. He started home delivery because the government limits the
licensing of outlets for beer and because he correctly guessed that
people who might be embarrassed to go into a beer store would be
happy to have a few cases discreetly brought to their door. Stymied
by a government ban on advertising alcoholic drinks, he has
employed a Trojan horse technique, filling the airwaves with spots
for nonalcoholic beer that look very much like beer ads in Europe
and the United States and that have done wonders for both products.
</P>
<P>
   Before the government sale of the brewery, one would-be investor
had estimated that it could be run with a tenth of its 3,200
employees. But with wholesale dismissals forbidden by the
government, Zayat set out instead on a total reorganization. He cut
the production force to about 800 and hired experts from
Carlsberg's consulting unit. He transferred hundreds into the
brewery's new sales force and assigned others to work in warehouses
or as drivers. About 300 people accepted early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He also created a group of inspectors and put them in charge of
quality control. He got rid of a committee system of management,
raised salaries, provided stock bonuses for employees and replaced
the brewery's six-day workweek of six-and-a-half-hour shifts with a
five-day, 8 a.m to 5 p.m. routine. Now, with business booming,
Zayat says, he has more employees than when he started.
</P>
<P>
   Zayat brought the plant into the late 20th century with some
simple equipment that speeded up work enormously. When he arrived
there were four telephones; now there are 1,600. He vastly
increased the number of desktop computers (from four to more than
300) and fax machines (from one to dozens). And he nearly doubled
the delivery fleet to 450 trucks.
</P>
<P>
   To help improve quality control, he installed a simple plastic
sheet to keep dirt and bugs from falling into beer bottles as they
trundled along a conveyor, and he bought an X-ray machine to
examine every filled bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Zayat said he always planned to expand the brewery's product
line. But even he has been bowled over by the nearly 400 percent
increase in the volume of nonalcoholic beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our future,'' said Ms. Mostafa, Zayat's marketing
director.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of the company's profit used to come from
regular beer, she said, but in three years, even with continued
growth in beer sales, the proportion is expected to fall to 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never succeed in getting every Egyptian to drink
beer,'' Ms. Mostafa said. ``It will always be a Muslim country. But
nonalcoholic beer has all the elements to succeed. It's very
healthy. It doesn't have caffeine. It looks like beer. It tastes
like beer. But it's religiously accepted.''

 &HT;    Taking note of the NBA Eastern Conference

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Miami Heat guard Tim Hardaway has suffered a setback
in his recovery from a jammed right knee. At midweek, he said he
was at least 10 days from running again.
</P>
<P>
   That means Hardaway will end up missing at least 17 games from
an injury he thought would sideline him just a game or two.
Hardaway missed his 14th game Wednesday and will sit out the next
three _ today at Milwaukee; Tuesday against Minnesota, in the
Heat's final game at Miami Arena; and Wednesday at Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest Hardaway could return is Jan. 2 against Orlando in
Miami's first game in AmericanAirlines Arena. But Hardaway told TNT
he could miss another month.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway resumed practice last Friday, and coach Pat Riley
hinted that his return was close. But Hardaway said he experienced
Tuesday ``a little feeling that shows the knee is weak.'' As a
result,
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway will not run, practice or do anything to exert pressure
on the knee until at least Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee is not responding,'' Hardaway said. ``I'm going to do
nothing for 10 days and see if it comes around. There's still
weakness and a little bit of pain. Sometimes it takes longer than
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway reiterated that surgery is not an option, because an
MRI last month found no structural damage. Rest, he said, remains
the only option.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jamal Mashburn, who has missed two games with a sprained
left ankle, remains out indefinitely. The injury is between a Grade
1 and Grade 2 sprain. Although the Heat is listing Mashburn as
``day to day,'' Riley sounded pessimistic about a quick return.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of soreness,'' Riley said. ``I
watched him the past couple of days, and he could barely walk. ...
It's disappointing to
</P>
<P>
   have to go through (injuries) as a club that has high
expectations. Our plans this year were big. I'm concerned about it.
</P>
<P>
   MAGIC DECISION
</P>
<P>
   You'll know whether Orlando cares about making the playoffs by
what the team elects to do with forward Chris Gatling. With Gatling
playing well, the club has a winning record, but this was a season
when they were looking to go lottery. If Gatling is traded for cap
room, the team probably will suffer in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can be a most unpleasant decision,'' general manager John
Gabriel said about trading players from a potential playoff team.
``We're excited and perplexed over our success. But we're not
satisfied, either. ... We're leading sort of a double life, with
the best of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   STAYING ALIVE
</P>
<P>
   You can walk up to the United Center box office and buy a ticket
before every game. So how do they keep that record sellout streak
going?
</P>
<P>
   They are using some creative accounting, which is not uncommon
in the NBA. For one thing, the Bulls have had attendance as high as
24,544, yet ``capacity'' is 21,711. They have sold 17,000 season
tickets and most of the 216 suites with four seats each, which
count into the total.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago ticket broker Eric Soderholm said: ``Their streak is
still alive? Are you kidding? Really? I can't give Bulls tickets
away. They went from the greatest ticket on the planet to the worst
ticket, just like that. Our business is going to be down 50 percent
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   BIRD SPEAKS
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird on the state of the NBA today and why he's had
enough:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Magic (Johnson) and Isiah (Thomas) hugging and kissing
before that game, (Game 1 of the 1990 Finals).
</P>
<P>
   ``That changed this whole league. That's all that goes on now.
It's a lovefest. It's like Woodstock in 1969, everyone huggin' and
kissin'.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell guys, `I know I'm a little different than you guys. But
I never could even speak to an opponent.'''
</P>
<P>
   PISTON TIME
</P>
<P>
   If the Pistons are going to assert themselves, now's the time.
They are 12-14, but 11 of their next 15 games starting today are
against teams with .500 records or worse. They will play three of
the four teams with above-.500 records at The Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next 15 to 20 games are real important,'' Grant Hill
predicts. ``If we don't come out of it with a winning record, guys
could start to mail it in. The month of January is very important.
We cannot go into February thinking we are out of it. We are still
in the hunt, and we know we are a better team than we've shown.''

 &HT;    Taking note of the NBA Western Conference
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the Rockets going nowhere, there would seem no
reason for Hakeem Olajuwon to rush back this season, if ever. But
Olajuwon said he still wants to play this season, has not given up
on this team and wants to finish his contract next season.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon had approached the team in the offseason about the
Rockets buying out the last year of his contract and retiring after
the season. But Olajuwon and the team could not come to an
agreement about the remaining $16 million on his contract. Since
his Nov. 26 injury, Olajuwon decided he would like to keep playing
next season, to go out on a better note than this season is likely
to provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the way I want to go out, not the way I want to
end my career,'' Olajuwon said. ``It hurts too much to see us
losing every night, and, after all that I have been through in 16
years and helped to accomplish with this team, it is not the way I
want people to remember the conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is rehabilitate my injury, get back into the
lineup as soon as possible and do anything I can to turn this
around and to play out my contract through next season with the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to end my career here in Houston. I cannot picture
myself being anywhere else or wearing any other uniform. This is
where everything has happened and where it should come naturally to
its conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon underwent hernia surgery Dec. 1 and was expected to
miss six weeks. Olajuwon said that until the injury, he was feeling
stronger than he had in three years and expected to become more
effective through the season. His decline in previous seasons, he
said, was the result of pain he no longer has.
</P>
<P>
   He told Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich at halftime of the game
against the Knicks on Dec. 14 that he wanted to return this season
and play out his contract. He went on to say that he still believes
the Rockets could make the playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' he said. ``It is December. I have never entered a
season in my career where I didn't think it was possible to compete
for a championship, and I have never been in a season where anyone
gave up this early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It disturbs me to hear talk of the future, of next year
already. It sounds like you don't want to compete. I know that to a
lot of people, making the playoffs looks impossible to accomplish.
But isn't that where Clutch City came from originally? Didn't
people think it was impossible in 1994 and 1995?''
</P>
<P>
   DENVER DEALING?
</P>
<P>
   Denver Nuggets coach Dan Issel won't deny the talk about Larry
Hughes and Ty Hill for Ron Mercer and Bryant Stith. He will only
say that he did not originate the deal. Mercer, looking for maximum
dollars, insists he has not ruled out returning to Denver. He told
the Denver Post that reports that he thinks Denver is too cold and
that he doesn't like it there were overblown and inaccurate. He
will test the free-agent market, but he said that it doesn't mean
he doesn't' want to be in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   SPUR SLOWDOWN
</P>
<P>
   The offense of the San Antonio Spurs is stagnating. Tim Duncan
has been dominating, but, if the Spurs run into a team with guards
quick enough to double and recover, they're in trouble. ``We have
the title,'' Robinson said, ``but we're still a work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES
</P>
<P>
   Center Sean Rooks continues to slip further out of the Dallas
Mavericks' rotation. Rooks hasn't played a single minute in the
past three games. ... Don't look for Mookie Blaylock's name in
Golden State box scores for a while. He's out with a strained calf.
... In Sacramento, Jason Williams, nicknamed ``White Chocolate,''
is turning into the White Shadow. He's shooting 39 of 144 from
three-point range and averaging almost four turnovers a game. . . .
New Vancouver coach Lionel told Bryant Reeves he must shift his
focus to defense, and Reeves, who owns a $65 million contract isn't
happy. In Hollins' first two games, Big Country got a total of
eight shots; he has averaged 14 points for his career. ``It's
something I'm going to have to kind of learn to deal with,'' Reeves
said. ``I know I'm not going to get the touches anymore. I'm going
to become more of a screener. That's what (Hollins') head-coaching
philosophy is, and I've got to live with it. ... You just have to
play with it, that's all I'm going to say about that.''

 &HT;    Playoff system likely far down the road
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NCAA determines all of its championships through
playoffs _ except for major-college football.
</P>
<P>
   Only one sport conducts its postseason events outside of the
NCAA's domain _ major-college football.
</P>
<P>
   The unique system for Division I football results largely from
the universities' cozy, long-standing relationships with bowl
games. The bowls have confined any playoff to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that the relationship survives, bowl committees
annually spend millions of dollars in lobbying efforts, according
to a review of bowls' tax records by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. The bowl games are rewards not just for the
players but also for the coaches and athletics administrators _ and
their spouses _ who are entertained by the host committee in the
days leading up to the game. A playoff would interfere with, if not
end, the arrangement, which dates back more than six decades.
</P>
<P>
   Bowl administrators are out-of-season fixtures at the NCAA and
major conference meetings, working crowded lobbies and huddling one
on one with key decision-makers to keep their games and the system
itself alive. A handful of bowls take hobnobbing to another level
by staging relaxed, fun-in-the-sun weekend packages to entice
coaches and athletics officials to their cities for golf and
tennis. Many offer prizes.
</P>
<P>
   If showered on a college athlete, such extravagances would cost
him his eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The most rec statements indicate that the Tostitos Fiesta
Bowl spent $108,227 on its Fiesta Frolic, a three-day event held
each spring in Tempe, Ariz. The FedEx Orange Bowl listed expenses
of $112,891 for its weekend entertainment, Summer Splash, in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   While coaches and athletics directors in increasing numbers are
supporting a playoff system to replace or alter the bowl system,
the bowls are banking on years of goodwill to maintain the status
quo. They sell the relationships, the pageantry, the parades and
vacationlike atmosphere of their events. They hope the schools
won't be able to say, ``Hey, it's been great, but we're moving
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Another impediment to a playoff, at least in the short term, is
the series of contracts that would keep the bowl format in place
halfway through the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the current playoff talk focuses on a 16-team system
being pitched to major conferences by Swiss-based marketing giant
ISL. It promises annual payouts to schools totaling $375 million,
two and a half times the $150 million that bowls are expected to
generate this year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Big Ten and Pac-10 conferences have contractual
obligations to the Rose, one of four bowls in the Bowl Championship
Series, through the 2005 season. The BCS title game rotates among
the four bowls _ Rose, Sugar, Orange and Fiesta. Conference
officials might start negotiations next month about extending the
BCS agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has exclusive television rights to the game, being played
for the second time Jan. 4, in the Sugar Bowl. The game is designed
to result in a so-called national champion, although sometimes in
the past, bowl results wound up splitting the championship between
the two major polls.
</P>
<P>
   Two additional BCS championship games are scheduled, through the
end of the 2001 season. The contract includes an option for a
three-year extension with ABC and the BCS, which is run by
commissioners of the six major conferences _ Atlantic Coast,
Southeastern, Big East, Big Ten, Pac-10 and Big 12. ''The whole
playoff concept is flawed right now because ABC has a long-term
deal,'' said TV consultant Barry Frank, who negotiates rights deals
for major sporting events. ''I don't see ABC saying, 'OK, let's
just tear up all these contracts and start all over again and maybe
lose (TV rights).' Knowing the mindset over there, it would amaze
me if they allowed that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl did agree to free the Big Ten or Pac-10 champion
if either qualified for the BCS title game, but it would be
unlikely to tear up its own agreement before 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make a playoff work, you've got to have everybody in it,''
said SEC commissioner Roy Kramer, coordinator of the BCS. ``You
can't have a Penn State (of the Big Ten) sitting out there not
being part of it. ... So, it would be very difficult for anything
to happen as long as there's a Rose Bowl agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   If a playoff does arrive, Kramer said that he thinks ISL will
not operate it. ``It's not going to be run by a foreign marketing
company,'' he said. ``It might be outside the NCAA, but it'll be
run by the (schools and conferences).''
</P>
<P>
   When playoff talk heats up, the bowls react in unison to
describe the system as an unmanageable pressure cooker that would
deprive student-athletes of valuable class time. The playoff bug,
they argue, mainly afflicts athletics directors who once coached
basketball and are smitten with its system. They repeat the same
mantra _ ``bowls have never been healthier'' _ while tossing out
supporting facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   A playoff involving 16 teams _ the ISL plan _ would destroy the
major New Year's bowls, except for one as possible host for the
championship game. Because early rounds probably would be played at
campus sites, to assure full stadiums, the bowl cities would suffer
lost tourist business. Whether some bowls would survive, perhaps as
football's version of the weakened postseason NIT basketball event,
is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   The most enticing aspect of a playoff to university presidents _
who must approve such a system _ is the major payday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is still some tradition with the bowls, but money
talks,'' Frank said. ``Michigan (football) lost $2 million (last
year), and Michigan has a 100,000-seat stadium and one of the
biggest programs. So, if Michigan loses $2 million, what is Ohio
University or Rutgers losing? I think there is always a need for
money in college athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   However, universities' financial needs were reduced recently
when the NCAA accepted an 11-year, $6 billion deal from CBS for
rights to its basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   A football playoff would be even more lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Former Oklahoma athletics director Donnie Duncan conducted a
study five years ago that concluded the ISL projections of $375
million annually for a football playoff are valid. But Kramer
dismisses the figure.

 &HT;    Francis' leadership helping Coyotes capture victory
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This man doesn't scare easily. As a youth, Bobby
Francis would sit in Madison Square Garden, watching the New York
Rangers and listening to the crowds' chants. The content varied,
depending upon the home team's standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the crowd chanting, `Emile, Emile,''' said the son
of former NHL coaching legend Emile ``Cat'' Francis. ``I also
remember when things weren't going so well and everybody was
chanting, `Goodbye, Emile.' I used to turn to my mom and ask,
`Where are we going?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Francis isn't going anywhere right now _ except, perhaps,
up. The new coach of one of the most unstable franchises in NHL
history, Francis has led the Phoenix Coyotes to a record of 20-12-3
going into the two-day Christmas break.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes sit atop the Pacific Division, even though goalie
Nikolai Khabibulin has sat out the entire season in a contract
dispute; his recently acquired replacement, Sean Burke, has missed
11 games in a row with a torn ligament in his thumb; and the
Coyotes are playing a style opposite of Francis' predecessor, Jim
Schoenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld's conservative, defensive preachings and Phoenix's
continued post-season failures got the coach fired after two
seasons. General manager Bobby Smith's directive to Francis was to
open up the offense. The Coyotes' 110 goals after 35 games put them
on a season pace of 258 goals, 53 ahead of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of skill on this team, and I thought we could
improve our transition game and on the power play,'' Francis said.
``We've encouraged our defensemen to jump into the play more, and
they've helped us generate a lot scoring chances. You can't do that
without leaving yourself vulnerable on defense, but the results
have been positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody likes points. It helps come negotiation time.''
</P>
<P>
   The insecure life of an NHL head coach has been well illustrated
by the Winnipeg/Phoenix franchise. Francis is the club's fifth
coach since 1994 and 14th in 21 seasons. The biggest reason for the
turnover is playoff failures. The franchise last won a post-season
series when it was the Winnipeg Jets in 1987. The Jets/Coyotes have
lost nine consecutive series since.
</P>
<P>
   Francis was a surprise choice to replace the fired Schoenfeld,
but he was well-schooled. He coached successfully for several years
in the IHL and AHL, and for the last two assisted Boston's Pat
Burns. He also learned from Emile Francis, who coached in New York,
St. Louis and Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral issues,'' Francis responded, when asked what he
learned from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid attention to the way he treated people, with respect
and honesty, and he expected the same in return. With him, a player
always knew where he stood. Nobody was blindsided.''
</P>
<P>
   Communication with players was a problem under Schoenfeld.
Presumably, it's not a problem anymore.

 &HT;    Hello, I must be going
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even for a guy who has played with seven NHL teams in
11 seasons, this season qualifies as a bizarre one for Rick
Tabaracci. The veteran goalie went a month into the season before
being signed by the Thrashers as an unrestricted free agent. He was
assigned to Orlando (IHL), called up as an injury replacement,
started one game against Dallas, was sent back down and then was
traded to Colorado. The Avalanche needed a veteran goalie for the
expansion draft in June. But NHL rules stipulate that the goalie
must have played at least 25 games over the last two years, and
Tabaracci was at 24 (23 with Washington, one with Atlanta). So the
Avs recalled Tabaracci from the minors, started him against
Carolina, won 4-2 and now might send him back down. ``To be honest,
I don't know what the plan is for me,'' Tabaracci said. ``I
maintain one thing: If you play well, you are going to play. I
believe I can still help a lot of NHL clubs. Hopefully, it's this
one, but if it's not, it's another one.'' Columbus or Minnesota,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   FACEOFF: TERRY MURRAY
</P>
<P>
   Coach, Florida Panthers
</P>
<P>
   _ Update: Blew a third-period lead for the first time this
season in a 3-3 tie with Atlanta. Still has the inside track to win
the Southeast Division, despite the recent loss of goalie Trevor
Kidd, who might require season-ending surgery on his dislocated
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   _ On preventing a letdown by his players during Kidd's absence:
``When it first happened, we addressed it with the players to make
sure the mental slump didn't creep in. We didn't want them to feel
sorry for themselves, just because we were losing a key player on
the hockey club. I think talking about it was the right thing to
do. We have to keep going forward and have confidence in (backup
Mikhail) Shtalenkov. We've handled it pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On some recent losses: ``Anytime we lose a game, even though
we respect the other teams, we believe it's because of our own
performance. We're trying to get back to the playoffs. We believe
we can play with the top teams in the league. But when you're not
prepared mentally, any team can take it to you. Then, when you
start to think it's time to turn the table around, sometimes it's
too late. That's what's happened in all the games we've lost this
year.
</P>
<P>
   _ On acquiring a replacement for Kidd: ``We're still in the
process of making phone calls and finding what the heck is out
there to see if we can make a deal to give us the tandem that we're
going to need.''

   NEWYEAR _ ATLANTA _ Rosalyn McCrary had a bad case of the
Millenium jitters. The banquet server at the Marriott Hotel at
Lenox was scheduled to work New Year's Eve but feared leaving her
young son at home alone. So she approached her boss about the
problem. That discussion set into motion a novel way to help
workesrs cope with being sepArated during the holiday. The hotel
management has set aside 50 rooms _ that go for mroe than $200 a
night _ for employees and their families. The hotel will pay the
costs of the room and food for the night. It's a small price to pay
for their peace of mind, said the hotel's GM. (Poole, Atlanta

   SHOPLIFTING _ It's a gangbuster holiday season for retailers,

   JESUS-APPEARANCE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jesus Christ is
worshiped as the human incarnation of the son of God, and his
likeness has been reproduced for hundreds of years by thousands of
artists. But they've all been making it up. The Apostles were
assiduous in copying down Jesus' message, but no one bothered to
write about his appearance. We know some things he said, but not at
all how he sounded. And though Bible readers are given vague hints
about the visage of the Prince of Peace, even those are
contradictory. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JESUS-CRUCIFY _ The spikes nailed through Jesus' wrists and
ankles did not kill him. The crown of thorns that cut into his brow
was little more than a nuisance, and the whipping he endured before
he was crucified was almost an act of mercy. (Belkin, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JESUS-LIFE _ Jesus may have been the Prince of Peace, but if his
life was at all typical of his fellow Nazarenes in the first
century, he didn't live like royalty while he was growing up.
(Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JESUS-MISTLETOE _ The mistletoe you're trying to get caught
under this Christmas season wasn't always the semi-parasitic plant
it is today. According to an old French folk story, mistletoe used
to be a tree in its own right until it was caught in the wrong
place at the wrong time. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JESUS-GIFTS _ It takes a little of the magic away from the Magi
to be able to buy frankincense and myrrh for $2.95 in the incense
department at just about any New Age bookstore. But in their day,
the Three Wise Men had a different set of circumstances with which
to deal. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    Football bowls big game of money, tradition
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ College football bowl games are as much a part of the
holidays as eggnog and gifts. In the next 12 days, 19 games will be
played _ all on TV _ bringing the postseason total to 23, a record.
</P>
<P>
   Bowls are big business, and getting bigger each year. And here
is their little secret: While most bowls are set up as tax-exempt
nonprofit organizations and traditionally carry a charity-minded
image, the bowls pass along just a tiny portion of their revenue to
needy causes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the total that went to charity was less than $1
million. Rather, the ``charities'' that benefit most are the
colleges, which shared in at least $140 million. And the bulk of
the money went to salaries, facilities and equipment in the
athletic departments _ not to academics.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were derived from an Atlanta Journal-Constitution
analysis of tax returns over the past three years of the nonprofit
bowls. (Four are considered for-profit and their returns are
private.) During that period, the bowls generated $393 million in
revenue, and their latest tax returns show they have a cumulative
war chest of $43 million.
</P>
<P>
   To earn NCAA certification, bowls are required to turn over 75
percent of income before expenses to the participating
universities. The Internal Revenue Service permits the practice of
designating college athletics as ``educational nonprofits'' for tax
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   So, like many other sports-related organizations, bowls enjoy
the same tax benefits as groups such as the American Red Cross and
the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can (say) that if a bowl is giving Notre Dame $5 million
to come and play, they're giving it to a charity,'' said Chuck
McLean, vice president for research with GuideStar, the largest
database on nonprofit organizations. ``Notre Dame is a public
charity in a very odd sense.''
</P>
<P>
   With so few dollars directed to charities, bowls have begun to
downplay their philanthropic efforts. Many say there is simply no
money left after the schools take their cut and pay their expenses,
which range from six-figure salaries for executives to millions of
dollars for entertaining guests.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the AJC analysis found that:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, which has surpassed the Rose as the
wealthiest bowl with $11 million in assets, put $25.2 million in
university coffers last year while giving charities $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rose Bowl, with a $10.2 million war chest, paid $25.5
million to colleges and less than $100,000 to charities.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl at the Georgia Dome paid out a
record $3.2 million to the universities of Georgia and Virginia,
while the WinShapes Home Program, a foster homes group that was
cited in promotional brochures as receiving a portion of ticket
sales, got $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ The FedEx Orange Bowl, which produced revenues of $34 million,
gave $12,000 to a local college assistance program.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Wells Fargo Sun Bowl paid teams $2 million last year,
while contributing $35,000 to El Paso area sports organizations.
</P>
<P>
   _ The COMPUSA Florida Citrus Bowl paid out $7.34 million from
revenues of more than $12 million, with $100,000 going to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Among expenditures found in the returns were $120,000 for
complimentary tickets (Rose), $206,000 for a halftime show
(Orange), $55,000 for lobbying for a car rental tax that benefited
the bowl (Sun) and $454,000 to lease stadium skyboxes (Citrus).
</P>
<P>
   ''We do give to other charities, but it's small in comparison to
the amounts we give to universities,'' acknowledged Stan Laybourne,
the Fiesta Bowl's chief financial officer. ''It's a bowl-by-bowl
situation. Some of the bowls that are just a football game _ the
lower-tier bowls _ have enough trouble just paying the minimum NCAA
requirement. As you go up the food chain of bowls, you do other
(fund-raising) events and then you can give to . . . other
charities.''
</P>
<P>
   The bowls have always worked with the host cities to help draw
tourism and business. The Peach, in Atlanta, is one of three
directly tied to its local chamber of commerce or convention
bureau, from which funding is received.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we're all in this business to provide
something for our community,'' said John Fulmer, Sun Bowl chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, bowls are seeking to ``expand the brand'' by
conducting other events. The Nokia Sugar Bowl game, which this year
is for the national championship, is the highlight of a series of
events _ college basketball doubleheader, marathon, swim meet,
international junior tennis tournament, regatta, youth soccer
tournament and the National Invitational Flag Football
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   This year's kickoff between Florida State and Virginia Tech is
not until Jan. 4 _ three days after the traditional New Year's Day
bowl date _ so New Orleans hopes to lure people into town early and
induce them to stay longer. With so many activities planned around
the game, the economic impact should far exceed last year's figure
of $137 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bowl's entertainment budget just for parties representing
the participating schools is about $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three team functions that are required, plus two
spouse functions where we entertain the wives _ which has become a
big thing,'' executive director Paul Hoolahan said. ``We'll
entertain 300 to 400 women on two full days. A golf outing. All the
pre-game media stuff. We have the Gala, which is our signature
event. That is 1,500 people, from 7 (p.m.) to 1 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Kevin Ash, Rose Bowl game director: ``Team entertainment
used to be giving each player a deck of cards. Now it's lunch and
dinner, shows, clothing, gifts. It's not only the players; it's the
coaches, administration, coaches' wives.''
</P>
<P>
   The most famous event associated with a bowl game is the
Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we look at it, we're a parade first,'' Rose Bowl
executive director Jack French said. ``Our volunteers are much more
enamored of the parade than they are the Rose Bowl game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rose is both the oldest bowl and the last to add a corporate
sponsor to its title. It is now the Rose by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Fiesta organizers are favorably viewed as the Microsoft of the
bowl business. Two years ago, the committee took over what was then
the Copper Bowl, also in Arizona, and signed up title sponsor
Insight.com. Together they generated $22.2 million in revenue. Last
year, the Fiesta produced a $25.2 million payday for schools in the
first designated ``national championship'' game.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is talk of the Fiesta organization moving across the
border and staging another bowl in Monterrey, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some real potential down there,'' said John Junker,
Fiesta Bowl executive director. ``Everybody says there are too many
bowls. Well, I think maybe there are too many fast-food
restaurants, or too many networks. That is a marketplace judgement.
If a bowl can pay the bills, attract teams and do the job of
rewarding teams, then that is what college football has wanted us
to be.''

   ATLANTA _ Talk about an image makeover. At the start of the
1990s, the Peach Bowl compared with the Cotton, Orange or other big
bowls the way Trump would fit with Bush, Bradley, Gore and McCain.
Teams usually played on an overcast or drizzly afternoon, in a
half-empty Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, for a paycheck barely
covering expenses. The game flirted with bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl isspiffed up and financially
robust. It is playing to packed houses inside the
temperature-controlled Georgia Dome, with every game this decade
going down to the wire. Since 1995, only three bowls have attracted
larger average crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The Peach's bank account reflects its resurgence. An analysis of
federal income-tax returns for the last three years shows net
assets of $2.1 million, surpassed only by the traditional New
Year's Day big boys _ Rose, FedEx Orange, Tostitos Fiesta and Nokia
Sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia-Virginia game last December helped generate more
than $5.1 million in total revenue and had an estimated $35 million
impact on the local economy. The bowl's payout to participating
schools has increased 100 percent in the 1990s, with UGA and
Virginia splitting $3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's Clemson-Mississippi State matchup is expected
to generate as much as $3.6 million for the schools and have a
local economic impact of $45 million. The game sold out earlier
than ever, and the teams are expecting to bring a combined 50,000
fans to town.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround took root in 1985 after Peach officials persuaded
the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and city business leaders to
take control of the game. The Peach had no title sponsor and was
strapped for cash. Ron Allen, then chairman of the chamber and head
of Delta Air Lines, accepted the challenge by writing a six-figure
check for his company.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Peach Bowl is set up as an affiliate of the chamber,
with offices in its downtown Atlanta headquarters. Key chamber
officials serve as trustees of the bowl. The event returns a small
portion of profits to the chamber for its past financial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling was to get it to the chamber, because it was the
one group in the city that could get behind it and keep it alive,''
said former Peach volunteer Steve Hatchell, executive director of
the Orange Bowl. ``We didn't want to lose it and lose face that
Atlanta couldn't sponsor a bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Peach secured Chick-fil-A as title sponsor, while
also signing on Coca-Cola, Texaco and NationsBank. It signed a
long-term broadcast deal with ESPN and expanded its crew of
volunteers from fewer than 10 to more than 400. A contract with the
Atlantic Coast and Southeastern conferences to provide teams for
the game clinched the transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the No. 1 or No. 2 alumni base of most, if not all,
ACC and SEC schools living in Atlanta,'' bowl president Gary Stokan
said.
</P>
<P>
   That has given the Peach a regional flavor, but officials aren't
opposed to branching out.
</P>
<P>
   Stokan talks of elevating the game to a higher level, perhaps
moving into the Bowl Championship Series if a slot should open or
even bidding to host a national championship game if college
football goes to a playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   After putting last year's Peach Bowl to bed, Stokan led a
scouting mission to the first BCS title game in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to their parades, to their festivities, just to
compare it to what we do,'' he said. ``Certainly, we can't go from
what we're doing now to a BCS game, but we can look at what the
expectations are and start to drive our committees to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   That means moving the Peach beyond just a postseason football
game to a series of events during the year.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Peach conducted the Office Depot ACC-SEC Celebrity
Golf Invitational at the Country Club of the South for coaches and
athletics directors. The bowl held a reception the night before
with ESPN football analyst Lee Corso as speaker. Proceeds benefited
Georgia Baptist Hospital, which this week will send through Atlanta
a mobile screening unit decorated as a peach.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Peach Bowl FanFest this week in the Georgia World
Congress Center features 40 games and exhibitions, ending with what
is being billed as the world's largest tailgate party on game day.
</P>
<P>
   The annual parade this year features Evander Holyfield as grand
marshal. Next year, the bol group has scheduled a women's
college-basketball doubleheader at Philips Arena, with Georgia,
Georgia Tech and national power Tennessee already booked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people think we're just a football game,'' Stokan said,
``that's not the case.''

 &HT;    Dealing to get the best bowl
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ During the week, Jack Oppenheimer is a
certified public accountant. But on football Saturdays, he turns
into something else _ bowl scout.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer loves the gig, which is college sports' equivalent
of being a globetrotting member of the International Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with a hunter-green COMPUSA Florida Citrus Bowl blazer
and a gift of gab, Oppenheimer pumps hands tirelessly like a
stumping politician as he works the press box at Bryant-Denny
Stadium, passing out Citrus stick-on patches. He is delighted when
an Alabama coed returns to ask if she could have another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those dirty jobs, and somebody has to do it,''
Oppenheimer says, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   For the bowl representative, life is good. Oppenheimer
volunteers his time, but either the host school or the bowl sends
him on weekend junkets to such football-crazed college towns as
Gainesville, Fla., Ann Arbor, Mich., and Knoxville, Tenn. He
schmoozes and boozes with athletics administrators, college
presidents and influential alumni _ all to build and maintain
relationships with schools if they wind up in Oppenheimer's New
Year's Day bowl in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's a lot of fun,'' says Oppenheimer, one of two
Citrus representatives assigned to Alabama's home game last month
with Mississippi State. ``If you go to Penn State's homecoming
weekend, who else can get a room in the Nittany Lion Inn and get
down on the sidelines late in the game? I had dinner at Joe
Paterno's house two years ago. How many guys can say that?''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Joe Pa, Penn State's legendary coach, served
lasagna and an assortment of other Italian dishes. ``What else
would you expect?'' Oppenheimer asked.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State lured him to a game last fall by arranging a
two-day stay at the Old Waverly Golf Club, an exclusive
country-club community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still working on Augusta; I'm a softy for golf,'' says
Oppenheimer, who only wishes a college football team played in the
same town as the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   The bowls spent more than $500,000 last year on travel alone for
its representatives, according to The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's analysis of the bowls' tax records. Typical
of the major bowls is the Outback, which spent $60,000 on travel
and and an additional $367,814 on social functions.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, before conferences struck long-term deals with
bowls to lock in their member schools, many bowl reps were colorful
characters who often worked cloak-and-dagger style into the wee
hours so they could return home with a commitment from top football
schools for a marquee matchup. Then, most of the best teams had
several bowl options and were romanced throughout the season, much
as high school recruits were.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three years later, former Orange Bowl president Nick
Crane remembers how he lost Pittsburgh and Heisman Trophy winner
Tony Dorsett to the Sugar Bowl. ``It was as simple as ABC,'' Crane
said. The TV network promised Pitt it would televise a few of its
games the following season if it committed to the Sugar _ on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Crane staged parties at his Coral Gables home for NBC, which
carried the Orange, and for big-name coaches and their athletics
directors. A successful businessman, Crane was known to discuss
investment strategies with guests, many of whom remain friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of discussions you have over a beer,'' he said. ``I
talked to Sue Paterno 20 or 25 years ago about buying gold.''
</P>
<P>
   A University of Miami trustee, Crane phoned Joe Paterno to check
on his interest in the school's football coaching job before Butch
Davis was hired in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The king of the hobnob was Jim ``Hoss'' Brock of the Cotton
Bowl. His tactics are legendary, from finagling a halftime
interview on a major network to befriending a top player, such as
Dan Marino, Doug Flutie or Eric Dickerson, who might influence his
team's postseason choice.
</P>
<P>
   Brock would show up on campus, with a trademark unlit stogie in
his mouth, on a Thursday, one day ahead of the other bowl scouts.
Every preseason, he would throw a party for preseason All-America
players when their media tour came through Dallas. And the joke was
that he visited Notre Dame, the most coveted bowl team for many
years, often enough to be fitted for a priest's collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the fun is gone, the spirited competition,'' said
Brock, ousted by the Cotton Bowl in 1995 after 20 years as
executive director. ``The people today in charge of the bowls,
except for some of the old-timers, are running it more to make sure
the business level is there and the sponsorship. My No. 1 concern
was to try and get the best football player in the country. And
however we were going to do it, we would do it. They never fussed
about my expenses or anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your bowl guys still go to conference meetings and they go to
certain big games just to show up,'' Brock said. ``I think the
personal involvement is history, and you lose something when you
don't have those relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of the conference tie-ins to bowls, many of the
so-called scouts are little more than colorfully dressed greeters.
The Peach, for example, is locked into one team from the Atlantic
Coast Conference and one from the Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But the revised system hasn't driven them off the road.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer traveled to seven games this fall for the Citrus,
which was represented at every SEC and Big Ten game by someone from
its 120-member selection committee. Eleven scouts from eight bowls
attended the Alabama-Mississippi State game, including ex-Falcons
coach Leeman Bennett and software executive Rod Hovater from the
Peach. In their bright, batteries-not-included blazers, the scouts
are seated on the third row of the press box, hovering above the
50-yard line, looking like a human fruit salad.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, cocktails and hors d'oeuvres were plentiful at
an invitation-only reception in the Paul W. Bryant Museum that also
included the Crimson Tide's 1978 and '79 national championship
teams. Then, it was off to dinner with athletics officials and the
CBS broadcast crew at the Cypress Inn, a restaurant overlooking the
Warrior River.
</P>
<P>
   At the reception, the Fiesta's Mike Doherty, a Scottsdale, Ga.,
hotel manager, never wandered far from the bar as he worked on the
Alabama officials and ex-players. He was hard to miss in his
canary-yellow blazer.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many games left, so tough to call,'' said Doherty, whose
bowl has a ``soft'' tie-in with the Big 12 but can choose the other
team from any league. ``The Southeastern Conference, no question,
is the top conference for college football. The finest in terms of
travel teams, bringing fans to bowl games. If we got any one of
your teams, we'd be fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, the Crimson Tide radio network hosted a
brunch. Then several scouts huddled with Alabama's interim
athletics director Finus Gaston to assess their chances of landing
the Tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of eating,'' said Bennett, chairman of the Peach's
selection committee, almost two hours before kickoff. ``I've been
in locker rooms, and I've been in press boxes. For somebody who
hasn't done that, it might be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovater, who admitted to feeling a rush, distributed Peach Bowl
fliers and patches, then attended the coaches' post-game news
conference. He and Bennett wore conservative navy blue blazers, set
off by an orange Peach Bowl emblem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the schools to know we're here and interested, and
they want to let us know they're interested,'' Hovater said. ``They
don't mind being nice if you show up. It's a sign that they've had
a successful year.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Peach wound up with Mississippi State as
its SEC team. The Citrus, which also has an SEC connection, landed
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on a November weekend in Alabama, Jack Oppenheimer made
some connections that might come in handy someday _ and he had a
good time besides.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The image of a long-dead sultan, bearded and
gazing impassively from beneath his ceremonial turban, has
captivated his former Ottoman capital.
</P>
<P>
   Although he speaks to Turks through the mist of their imperial
past, his message is thoroughly modern. To everyone's surprise, he
has become a symbol of Turkey's new turn toward Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Turks have long admired the sultan, Mehmet II, for his military
triumphs, especially his capture of Constantinople, now known as
Istanbul, in 1453. But at an extraordinary art show here, they are
seeing another side of him that perfectly fits the spirit of today.
</P>
<P>
   The show portrays Mehmet as a philosopher and linguist who
deeply admired European culture. By happy coincidence, it opened
just days before the European Union officially accepted Turkey as a
candidate for membership on Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Together these events reflect and contribute to the pro-European
feeling that is spreading in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The art show is distinguished not only by its timing, but also
by its size. It consists of only one painting: Gentile Bellini's
masterly portrait of Mehmet.
</P>
<P>
   Mehmet was the first sultan, and one of the first Muslims
anywhere, to defy religious tradition by allowing his portrait to
be made. Bellini's picture has become the best-recognized image of
the Ottoman era, a painting that virtually every Turk can instantly
identify.
</P>
<P>
   As the first and perhaps finest portrait of an Ottoman sultan by
a European artist, it also symbolizes Turkey's European dream. Some
who view it cannot help reflecting on how history might have
changed if later sultans had shared Mehmet's fascination with
European ideas and technology.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the painting's primal importance to Turkey, it had
never been shown publicly here until now. It is on loan from the
National Gallery in London for a one-month exhibition through Jan.
7, and it is drawing animated crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Before reaching the portrait itself, visitors pass a series of
panels describing Mehmet and his times. They portray the sultan as
a visionary who ``always looked westward'' and was fascinated by
science, literature and the wider world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so impressed by his thirst for knowledge,'' said Oktay
Dalibar, an engineer who visited on a recent afternoon. ``What a
personality, what an intellectual in that darkness of the Middle
Ages! A great role model for today.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bellini's oil portrait, which is displayed behind a protective
plastic shield, shows Mehmet in a reflective aspect. He is wearing
a red caftan with a fur collar, and there is a pronounced hook to
his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Before him lies a chest adorned with jewels signifying his
empire's wealth. Six crowns over his head represent the six Ottoman
sultans who ruled before him. The Roman motif of the framing arch
may suggest his dream of ruling Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen this picture so many times, in so many
schoolbooks and on so many walls over so many years that it's
really imprinted on our brains,'' said Mehmet Onkal, a business
consultant. ``Now it's finally here, the real thing. Hard to
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan Mehmet had good relations with the Medici family and
other powerful Italian clans, especially in Venice and Florence,
and at his request they sent him artists and craftsmen by the
dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Bellini, who had been court artist to the Doge of
Venice. He arrived in 1479 and spent the next year and a half at
the Ottoman court, painting erotic scenes on interior walls as well
as the famous portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months after the portrait was finished, Mehmet died.
Some historians believe that he was slowly poisoned on orders of
his son, who succeeded him as Beyazid II. If this is true,
Bellini's portrait is of a dying man.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan Beyazid considered his father's art collection decadent
and ordered it sold at auction. The Bellini portrait is believed to
have changed hands several times before being bequeathed to the
National Gallery in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after Mehmet's death, the Ottomans lost their
enthusiasm for Western culture, eventually isolating themselves
from the outside world. But Mehmet remains a hero to many Turks.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Mehmet Pere, a newspaper editor from a provincial
town, stopped to see the portrait during a recent visit to
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel proud and sad,'' Pere said as he emerged.
``I'm proud that we've been accepted as a candidate to join the
European Union, because we deserve it. But I'm sad because this
should have happened 500 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bellini painting, while an undoubted gem of 15th-century
Italian portraiture, is not considered a true masterpiece. But for
Turks it is a work of art in the fullest sense, because it helps
them define their collective identity. Today it encourages their
march toward Europe by asserting that Mehmet would have approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his ideas we could have participated in the
Renaissance,'' lamented Munever Eminoglu, manager of the Istanbul
gallery where the portrait is on display. ``Instead we had just a
short golden age for art and science. This painting is the most
direct link we have to that period.''

CALIFORNIA FIRM FILES COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT SUIT

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a bicoastal legal battle, BioDiscovery Inc. has filed suit in
federal court in Los Angeles seeking $50 million in damages from
the former General Scanning Inc. of Watertown, Mass., claiming
copyright infringement of its ImaGene software.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week GSI Lumonics, which acquired General Scanning
in March, said it is seeking a declaratory judgment from US
District Court in Boston, claiming its software, called Quantarray,
does not infringe on BioDiscovery's product.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Quantarray is a reverse-engineered version
of ImaGene developed by BioDiscovery. Both programs work with
scanning devices made by GSI Lumonics to help biologists determine
the vitality of genetic material.
</P>
<P>
   The ImaGene software enables medical researchers to quickly
quantify and analyze the presence, strength, and/or weakness of
genes in a sample of DNA material. The software helps determine if
a gene is healthy by assigning it a color: red for an unhealthy
gene, yellow for a healthy one. The BioDiscovery software also
helps scientists plot this information and create pie charts,
grids, and other expression patterns.
</P>
<P>
   BioDiscovery founder Soheil Shams said he had a distribution
agreement with the former General Scanning, which was marketing
ImaGene software with its scanning hardware. However, Shams claims
the company, which did not have its own software, developed
Quantarray to sell with its scanning hardware. He claims Quantarray
is a ``copycat'' version of ImaGene and violates BioDiscovery's
copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   GSI Lumonics sells a mix of products and services in the
consumer packaging, medical, aerospace, semiconductor, and
electronics marketplaces.

AN URGE TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Newspaper ads frequently aspire to drama, but the
attention-getting presentation of one recent full-page was
striking. The word ``MONEY'' in a script evoking the Gilded Age was
a draw for almost anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Targeted at the booming economy's new millionaires, the ad urged
them to do something with their money that may not have been the
first instinct of many of them: Give some of it away. Just write a
check to the nearest worthy cause and unload some of their wealth
on the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   It ran, appropriately, in the Globe's business section on Dec.
15. There was no name attached, no specific charity recommended, no
post office box or e-mail address. Just an open letter, paid for
handsomely by someone who didn't want anyone to know who he or she
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've received a wonderful gift this year,'' it stated.
``It's time to give some of it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The author tantalizingly threw out just enough detail to arouse
curiosity. ``I am one of you. I started with nothing, and I
remember just how sweet it was to make my first million. But I also
know the singular joy of giving some of it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as the ad appeared, people began to wonder who
had placed it. The names of several civic-minded Bostonians were
floated.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe's advertising department said whoever had placed the
ad had gone to considerable lengths to keep his or her identity
private. It was placed through an agency, Hill Holliday, without an
individual's name attached.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, I called Jack Connors, Hill Holliday's CEO, to ask
who had placed the ad. I asked if he had placed the ad; some people
thought they detected his style behind both the message and the
prose. Connors chuckled and told me he'd check with his client on
whether he could reveal the identity.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, he told me his client preferred to remain
anonymous. He wouldn't say whether he was his own client.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to the party and they would really like for us to
honor their request for anonymity,'' Connors said.
</P>
<P>
   I have my suspicions, but they don't matter. As people are
forever saying this time of year, it's the thought that counts. And
the thought behind that ad should resonate with a lot of folks.
</P>
<P>
   As the economy continues its overheated march to the millennium,
there are more well-off people than at any other point in our
lifetimes. There are also more people in need. We all know that.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't just that need is greater; it's also that more of
those in need are invisible. Meanwhile, many people have more ways
to avoid seeing the everyday realities in which so many others are
trapped. Connecting with other different people seems to require
more conscious effort for those of us who are able to escape to our
suburban fortresses, luxury cars, and comfortable vacations. But
those are hollow rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, it was embarrassing to talk like this; I probably
would have been embarrassed to write like this. Any fool could see
that liberalism was dead, and good riddance; farewell to sappiness
and hello to success and meritocracy.
</P>
<P>
   But, for many surprised people, something interesting has
happened along the way to running the company or retiring at 40. A
lot of people I know have discovered an emptiness they never saw
coming, sitting in big offices they never thought they wanted to
occupy and wondering what the hell they were doing there. They have
become something they never expected: cliches.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday season is always the peak time for platitudes,
promises, vows of reform. Illusory better selves emerge, pledging
goodwill toward men, peace on earth. The promises come easily, and,
of course, we mean them all when we make them.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of Christmas _ of redemption and salvation _ is a
personal matter. You believe it or you don't; you understand human
destiny that way or you don't. But Christmas long ago took on
another meaning for many people _ as a time to remember others, to
step outside their own desires and do for others as they would have
done to themslves.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that this spirit is more important now than ever. The
tools that have made so many people more affluent than they
expected to become have made us even more isolated, even more than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Writing checks is a poor substitute for human contact. But it is
a starting point for remembering how much of life there is beyond
the 401(k) balance and the next resort vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The step after that, now that could be the tough one.

MEXICAN CONGRESS IN DEADLOCK OVER BUDGET BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Infuriated opposition congressmen showered one of
their colleagues with pennies and trash on the floor of Congress
this week, accusing him of selling himself to the government after
he had voted for President Ernesto Zedillo's budget bill and
against one drafted by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hands are clean!'' shouted the congressman, Armando Lopez
Romero of the tiny Workers' Party, seeking to defend himself above
a chorus of catcalls and obscene insults on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of contempt was one of several incidents that
erupted after governing party floor whips had split a handful of
opposition lawmakers from their parties. The tactics blocked
passage of a budget drafted by four opposition parties whose
combined votes have since 1997 often controlled the 500-member
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the hardball tactics in a regular congressional
session that ended on Dec. 15 and in an extraordinary session on
Dec. 21 and 22, the governing party, known as the PRI, failed to
split enough votes from the opposition to pass its own $128 billion
proposal for next year. A second extraordinary session has been
scheduled, for Dec. 28. The budget has to be approved by Dec. 31 to
avert a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's obviously corruption here,'' Vicente Fox of the
center-right National Action Party, the opposition's leading
presidential candidate, SAID. ``Deputies have obviously been
bribed. This is the same old PRI and the same old government,
trying to get its budget approved on the basis of corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Arturo Nunez, leader of the PRI congressional
delegation. The party relied on sound political arguments in
persuading the opposition lawmakers to vote with the government, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These deputies took a principled decision when they voted with
us against the opposition bill,'' Nunez said.
</P>
<P>
   The infighting has concentrated the energies of much of the
political elite for a month. The rancor grew so furious that
opposition parties refused to authorize Zedillo to travel to
Washington this month for a meeting with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock appeared to owe more to parties' frantic attempts
to position themselves politically as Mexico heads into a
presidential election than to differences over dollars and cents.
The gap between the government's bill and the opposition's was
tiny, just 30 cents out of every $100 authorized for spending.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition budget would have appropriated $478 million more
for social spending than the PRI proposal. The president of
National Action, Luis Felipe Bravo Mena, said the four opposition
parties were seeking to channel the additional money to workers'
pensions, farm programs and other programs that ``would help
flesh-and-blood Mexicans, and not just the country's macroeconomic
statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   But the issue that focused discussion this week was the
Congress' desire to control how to spend the appropriations,
Dolores Padierna of the center-left Party of the Democratic
Revolution said. Opposition legislators sought to insure that the
Zedillo administration could not use social programs next year to
buy votes for the PRI presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida,
Ms. Padierna said.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition also pressed longtime demands for increased
federalism, seeking to transfer control over some expenditures from
the federal government to states and cities, she said.

TOO LATE TO LEAVE, GROZNY CIVILIANS TOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After weeks of trying to persuade civilians to flee
Grozny, Russian officials said Friday that residents had missed
their chance to leave and should hide in their shelters until
Russian forces have secured the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's warning was a fresh indication that the climactic
battle for the city is finally at hand. It was also a somber
reminder that Russia forces are determined to quickly subdue Grozny
even if it means fighting in a city still occupied by tens of
thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time to strike Grozny from the agenda is counted in
days,'' Nikolai Koshman, Russia's senior representative to
Chechnya, said at a news conference here Friday. ``It is better for
people to stay in Grozny while the operation is under way.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Grozny's civilians has become one of the most urgent
problems in Russia's military campaign against Chechnya's rebels.
With considerable fanfare, Russia established two escape corridors
for civilians to escape the besieged city.
</P>
<P>
   But the corridors, by and large, turned out to be a failure.
Only a fraction of Grozny's residents fled, and many who did found
themselves under fire in the escape routes.
</P>
<P>
   Koshman said that up to 50,000 civilians were still trapped in
Grozny and that only 8,000 had used the corridors.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television Friday showed thunderous artillery strikes
against Grozny as Russian forces have began to edge into the city.
Gen. Viktor Kazantsev, the commander in the North Caucasus, visited
troops on the outskirts of Grozny, another sign of the battle to
come.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how Friday's warning was being communicated to
Grozny's civilians, or whether any steps have been taken to reduce
the risk to them in the battle for the city. Most are living in
cellars, where they have been short of food, living in fear of the
punishing Russian bombardment and local marauders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing our best to avoid any strikes against the
districts where the civilians are located,'' Koshman said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from Grozny have said in recent weeks, however, that
the Russian strikes have been indiscriminate and that houses and
markets have been hit. Many victims, they said, are ethnic
Russians, too old, too weak or too scared to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces have said from the start that their plan is not
to ``storm'' Grozny, an allusion to the 1994-96 war, when Russian
forces raced into the center of the city and were roundly defeated
with enormous casualties on the Russian side. Instead, the basic
plan is to take Grozny neighborhood by neighborhood after pummeling
it with artillery and airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Ministry troops and a small number of forces controlled
by the former mayor of Grozny, Bislan Gantamirov, will reoccupy the
city. Gantamirov was imprisoned for embezzlement but rehabilitated
by Moscow, which is eager to find allies among the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials said that there were about 2,000
Islamic fighters in Grozny, and that they had thwarted several
efforts by the militants to break out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny was not the only objective. Russian artillery and
aircraft also attacked targets in the Argun Gorge, hoping to
prevent the rebels from escaping to mountain sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said that SU-24 bombers, SU-25 attack planes
and Russian MI-24 helicopter gunships carried out 71 missions on
Thursday. Kazantsev said the Russian military hoped to subdue the
entire breakaway republic, including the mountains, within three
weeks.

CHRISTIANS OF ALL STRIPES PACK BETHLEHEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ In the place where Jesus was born,
Christians of all denominations from around the world Friday
arrived to celebrate the Christmas that will usher in the third
millennium of the faith.
</P>
<P>
   Braving ominous warnings of millennial terrorism and a cold
drizzling rain, some 15,000 pilgrims _ including tour groups, heads
of state, and Palestinian families _ packed the ancient cobblestone
streets and newly renovated Manger Square for a Christmas Eve of
prayer vigils, joyous choirs, and rousing gospel music.
</P>
<P>
   A midnight mass was held inside the Church of the Nativity,
built upon the grotto where tradition holds that the Virgin Mary
took shelter and gave birth to the infant Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   On that cold night some 2,000 years ago the land was a rocky
desert expanse with caves where shepherds protected their flocks,
but Friday it was a scene of satellite TV trucks and a high-tech
sound and light shows on the theme of the Nativity beaming out to
the world's Christian believers.
</P>
<P>
   A giant, outdoor video screen broadcast the Mass and also
carried the ``Opening of the Holy Door'' at the Vatican by Pope
John Paul II, which opens the festivities of the ``great Jubilee of
the Incarnation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having a celebration, like a birthday. But one of our
messages tonight is, `Don't forget what it is all about, don't
forget whose birthday this is,''' said Rev. Robert Fortin, an
Assumptionist priest appointed by the Catholic Bishops Conference
to head up the Jubilee Celebrations in the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that amid all this hype all over the world, there will
also be quiet prayer and reflection on the meaning of the birth of
our Lord,'' said Fortin.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of the calendars of all three monotheistic
faiths in the Holy Land made Friday the Jewish Sabbath, the Friday
prayers for the Muslim Holy month of Ramadan, as well as Christmas
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   At noon in Bethlehem, which is overwhelmingly Muslim, the Omar
Bin Al Khatab mosque off Manger Square was packed with a thousand
worshipers, hundreds of whom put down prayer mats in the outdoor
plaza, bumping up against tourists and TV crews amid the Christmas
decorations and floating mylar Santa balloons.
</P>
<P>
   In the Muslim faith Jesus is revered as a prophet, and many
passages of the Koran show praise and love for Mary. The message
broadcast over loudspeakers from the mosque Friday was one that
emphasised the unity of Palestinians, about 98 percent of whom are
Muslim and 2 percent Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like a stone during the intifada together, standing up
against the Israeli occupation,'' the Muslim cleric Khalid Tafish
said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian President Yasser Arafat prayed with the Muslims in
the mosque and later arrived in a motorcade at the ancient
stone-facade of the Church of Nativity to attend the midnight Mass,
along with his wife, Suha, who is Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the celebration seemed tinged with Palestinian
patriotism as Arafat used the platform to show off Bethlehem, which
has been dramatically refurbished since it came under Palestinian
rule during Christmas 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The square was ringed with Palestinian flags. At the base of the
stage, an enormous sign in Arabic read, ``From Bethlehem 2000 to
the indepedendence and building of the Palestinian state, with its
capital being holy Jerusalem and under the leadership of President
Yasser Arafat.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Latin Catholic Patriarch Michel Sabbah's Christmas
message was punctuated with political demands for the release of
Palestinian political prisoners and the right of return for
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Manger Square housed the Israeli police station
during the Israeli occupation, which ended as a result of the
ongoing peace process. At that site, the Palestinian Authority has
constructed a new ``Bethlehem Peace Center.''
</P>
<P>
   The white cinderblock structure has the non-descript character
of an office park off an American interstate highway. And some wry
observers have even remarked that the edifice is a metaphor for the
peace process _ built at the last minute amid hopes by its
architects that the whole structure does not collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists with video cameras and travel guide books, who had
traveled here from all over Europe, Asia, and America, seemed
oblivious to the political trappings but fully engaged in the
significance of being present at the place where Jesus was born.
They flocked into the Church of Nativity to descend into the shrine
to touch the excavation of the grotto believed to be Jesus'
birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   Leah Mitchel, a Methodist kindergarden teacher from Greenville,
S.C., said, ``I just wanted to be here and to experience Bethlehem,
the place of our Lord's birth. What better place to be in the world
on the eve of the new millennium?''
</P>
<P>
   She said she ignored the US government's travel warnings
regarding threats of terrorism in the Middle East on the
millennium. ``My heart breaks for all those who kept at home. They
are missing so much,'' she said, her words punctuated by unsettling
bursts of firecrackers and bottle rockets over the square.
</P>
<P>
   Down a narrow street, away from the noise and the crowds
gathered in Manger Square, is an orphanage known as ``The Creche.''
In the small convent of the Catholic Daughters of Charity, some 55
orphaned children, from newborns to six year olds, were running and
crawling around in a playroom which was decorated with a wooden
replica of Jesus' grotto, often refered to as a manger. The
youngest infant, a 6-day-old boy named ``Jihad'' who had been
abandoned by his parents, was placed before the Creche as the nuns
handed presents to the children and led them in the song, ``Oh
Little Star of Bethlehem'' in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Ursula, a Palestinian Christian from the French order of
Daughters of Charity, said, ``We all celebrate the birth of Jesus,
Christian and Muslim alike. We celebrate by caring for these
children. We see in their eyes the hardship that Jesus suffered in
this land, but we also see in their eyes the hope and the light
that the baby Jesus signifies.''

 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time masks belonged to anthropology. They were
strange objects made of wood, shells, feathers and bells that
primitives wore for coming-of-age rituals, funerary rites, rain
dances, fertility festivals and seasonal get-togethers. As recently
as 1975, Claude Levi-Strauss wrote a study about the masks of the
Northwest Coast Indians, ``The Way of the Masks,'' showing their
relationship to the Indians' kinship patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are gone. There are no more primitives. Or rather, we
are all primitives. Modern people wear hockey masks, gas masks and
surgical masks. You could say that modern masks are just for
protection. You could also say that hockey, war and surgery are
rituals and that these masks reveal something about the
relationships of the people who wear them, but there's more to it
than that.
</P>
<P>
   Puppeteers, artists and dramatists are spinning their own
theories about the place of masks in modern culture now, and they
are finding that it is not all kinship or cranial protection.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall 1999 issue of The Drama Review, which was devoted to
puppets and masks, Stephen Kaplin, an artist and puppeteer who has
worked with Julie Taymor (the director of ``The Lion King'') and
the Bread and Puppet Theater, proposes an intriguing taxonomy of
``performing objects'' _ masks, puppets, Claymation figures,
animated cartoon characters, even actors. He suggests looking at
the ``puppet/performer dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the real physical distance between the
performing object and the performer. Animated cartoon figures
perform at a distance, in time and space, from the person who
animates them. Shadow puppets are closer to their operator, but not
as close as the hand puppet to the puppeteer. The closest
relationship, of course, is that of the actor and the character he
plays. Physically they are inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the case of Spaulding Gray or Annie Sprinkle, actors who
represent themselves on stage, the two are not the same. As Kaplin
writes, the actor who plays himself is still presenting ``a highly
edited, crafted and shaped self.'' (The issue becomes especially
tricky in the recent movie ``Being John Malkovich,'' in which
Malkovich plays himself being inhabited and operated by a rogue
puppeteer and a host of other people.)
</P>
<P>
   In Kaplin's scheme, masks are somewhere between puppets and
actors. A mask recontours the actor's face, Kaplin writes, but
``doesn't alter the actor's center of gravity.'' (According to this
logic, the mask of Scar in ``The Lion King,'' worn high above the
actor's face or held far in front of it, starts to become a
puppet.)
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean for a mask to be midway between a puppet and
an actor? The mask's split nature suggests a split purpose: the
person in a mask can pass as someone else while still acting on his
own behalf. Masks, in this sense, are transportation devices. The
wearer can travel to the unknown _ from life to death, earth to
spirit world, earth to moon _ while still retaining his place at
home.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition of masks at the St. Louis Art Museum, ``Masks:
Faces of Culture,'' which includes everything from a 7,000-year-old
funerary mask from the Middle East to a modern hockey mask and a
space helmet, bears this out. The show begins with a replica of one
of the cave walls in Lascaux, France, showing a 17,000-year-old
drawing of a man with a bird mask on his head and a speared bison
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Nunley, one of the curators, ventured an interpretation:
``By wearing the bird mask,'' Nunley said, the shaman believed he
could ``fly into the spirit world,'' where he could ask the bison's
spirit to come back the next year to be killed again.
</P>
<P>
   Cara McCarty, the other curator of the exhibition, suggested
that masks are for ``exploring other places.'' The look of the
masks can sometimes suggest what kind of passage is being
negotiated: life into death, winter into spring or boyhood into
manhood. For example, masks to bring rain may have lightning bolts
or serpents on them. Masks that allow soldiers to pass through
poison gases often have hoses sticking out of them.
</P>
<P>
   The very last object in the exhibition is a space helmet, a
bubble-shaped mask whose visor reflects the Earth. If you look at
it alongside all the other masks, the space helmet does not seem so
different from a shaman's bird mask. It is made for travel to an
alien world.
</P>
<P>
   If masks can do all this for astronauts and shamans, you might
wonder what they could do for the aliens among us.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Critical Vehicles'' (M.I.T. Press, 1999), the artist
Krzysztof Wodiczko describes the masks and instruments he has
designed to help immigrants make their way into a strange new
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   One is a mouthpiece or porte-parole that ``covers the mouth of
the wearer like a gag.'' This little mask has a small video monitor
that shows the immigrant's lips moving and a loudspeaker that
broadcasts a narrative the immigrant has recorded. The person who
wears it is immediately given ``a specific kind of power,''
Wodiczko writes. It transforms the immigrant ``into a kind of
cyborg'' who becomes ``an expert in the technology of speech in the
cyberspace era, an alien who has arrived in a xenophobic land.''
</P>
<P>
   Wodiczko has also created a puppetlike instrument called the
alien staff, which looks like a shepherd's crook, but it is not
used to tend sheep. It is a device to help immigrants and strangers
find their way in a new land, to help them talk to strangers about
``the unbearable complexity of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the staff, at eye level, is a small video monitor
showing the immigrant's face. The rod of the alien staff, which
Wodiczko calls the xenalog section, presents the relics of the
immigrant's history: ``rejected visa applications, immigration and
legal documents, apartment keys, old photographs and the various
identity cards acquired by the owner.'' Like the mouthpiece, the
alien staff is something that inspires curiosity and understanding
in a strange land.
</P>
<P>
   There is something strange and telling about these immigrant
inventions, which appear at once archaic and forward-looking,
shepherdly and cyborgian. They are made for immigrants to get the
upper hand, to appear more technologically advanced than the
strangers they walk among. Yet the thing the operators want to
communicate with all this gadgetry is their past.
</P>
<P>
   Wodiczko's instruments have something in common with an
18th-century gadget called the automaton chess player, which Marc
Sussman, a scholar and artist, describes in an essay in The Drama
Review. The automaton has mechanical hands that move the pieces on
a chess board, while the operator, a human chess player, crouches
concealed in the cabinet beneath. As Sussman points out, the
philosopher Walter Benjamin interpreted the hidden player as sacred
archaic thinking, ``which has to keep out of sight'' while history
and progress march straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The chess player beneath the automaton, the immigrant with the
cyborgian device, the shaman in the bird mask and the astronaut in
the space helmet are all wearing masks, and their masks say two
things at once: I'm marching forward into the unknown, but I'm
looking backward.

   The ruling came out of Philadelphia Wednesday and didn't create
much of a stir. But the ramifications are significant.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court
ruling that said the NCAA couldn't use minimum standardized test
scores to determine freshman eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, a lower court threw out the minimum standards for
freshman eligibility, saying the policy was unfair to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Chaos loomed, especially in college football and basketball,
where freshmen are intregral.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the decision, according to the court, was that
since the NCAA did not directly receive federal funding, it did not
have to abide by Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which
forbids discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national
origin.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the NCAA's minimum standards of eligibility based on
test scores, contended that the SAT and ACT tests were culturally
biased. A 2.5 point grade point average in 13 core academic courses
also was required.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on that issue will continue. But one thing was certain.
Some minimum requirements were better than none. An entire semester
passed with colleges and universities in limbo over who was
eligible and who was not.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, the case finally will be decided by the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   So be it. Frankly, making freshmen ineligible would solve the
problem, but that will never happen, especially with basketball
coaches battling the NBA for top high school prospects. Freshmen
ineligibility merely would increase the flow of top talent from
high school to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the new rules of freshmen eligibility are the
same as the old, and those are better than none.

   Syracuse is 8-0, is ranked ninth, and is playing like, well,
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   For some people that is not enough, which is hard to understand.
Few coaches anywhere do a better job than Jim Boeheim, but he still
hears the critics. The latest shot came last week when a four-part
series was published in the Syracuse papers detailing the decline
of Orangeman recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting stuff. But let's look at some numbers. This year's
start marks the 11th time in 24 seasons Boeheim's teams have been
at least 8-0. Winning 20 games is almost a guarantee. So is winning
a game or two in the NCAA Tournament. So is playing good defense.
This year's team is the runaway leader in defense in the Big East,
allowing 54.8 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of UConn, a guarantee of a 20-win season for any head
man in New England would get him coach-of-the-year votes, not
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Boeheim continues to take blasts. Granted, the Orangemen
have yet to play outside the Carrier Dome. But is there any doubt
about this team winning 20? And so what if other schools appear to
have better recruiting seasons. Let them translate that to 20 wins
a season and then give them praise.
</P>
<P>
   Boeheim's teams play hard, they play well, and they win. It's
hard to ask for more from a program.

   Rutgers's 85-65 loss to Florida last week continued the drought
the Scarlet Knights have had against Top 10 teams. Rutgers is 4-39
against Top 10 teams, with its last victory coming Dec. 3, 1981,
when it upset UCLA in first college game ever played in the
Meadowlands . . . Hot shooting award of week goes to St. John's in
its 98-86 win over Hofstra. Anthony Glover led the way with 35
points, which included 12 of 12 from the field and 11 of 13 free
throws. The Red Storm made 18 of 21 field goals in the second half
. . . The addition of 7-foot-2-inch transfer Karim Shabazz from
Florida State should improve Providence coach Tim Welsh's mood over
the holidays. But with losses to Holy Cross and Central
Connecticut, there's still more coal than candy in Welsh's holiday
stocking. Guard John Linehan is probably out for the season with an
injury and the Friars are young and inexperienced. ``We're going to
have to change things around without John,'' said Welsh. ``The way
things are right now we've only got one of our top seven players
back from last season.''

   Michigan State was hoping that All-America guard Mateen Cleaves
(broken foot) would be back by the Spartans' game against
Mississipppi Valley State, but it now looks more like the first of
the year and the start of the Big Ten season . . . Hanno Mottola,
in his second game back after preseason knee surgery, sparked Utah
in Wednesday night's 79-73 win over Texas with a career-high 32
points . . . Former Indiana and Arizona player (for a few months)
Luke Recker is petitioning the NCAA for a waiver that will allow
him to play at Iowa next fall instead of sitting out two semesters.
Recker is claiming a medical hardship. He transferred to Iowa to be
closer to his girlfriend, Kelly Craig, who was paralyzed in an
automobile accident last summer . . . New Mexico has picked up the
pace under Fran Fraschilla. Beating Arizona in Tucson, as the Lobos
did early last week, is no easy accomplishment . . . What's with
UCLA? The Bruins look good one game, horrible the next, with
Wednesday's 55-54 loss to Colorado State being the latest example
of the bad Bruins . . . Michael Jordan is struggling. That's Penn's
Michael Jordan, last season's Ivy League Player of the Year, who is
shooting just under 22 percent from 3-point land, which is part of
the reason the Quakers are 1-4 entering a tournament next week in
California. An ambitious schedule is the prime reason . . . In a
win over UNLV last week, Oklahoma State held the Runnin' Rebels to
1 of their first 23 3-point attempts . . . Ohio State might think
twice before scheduling state rival Toledo. A year ago the Rockets
upset the Buckeyes in Columbus. Wednesday night, the Buckeyes had
to go all-out to get a 64-61 win. ``Give Toledo credit,'' said Ohio
State coach Jim O'Brien. ``But we gave them way too much.''

   Memphis has talked to former UMass head man and current
Philadelphia 76ers assistant John Calipari about coaching the
Tigers. Calipari has put that on hold until the end of the season.
Memphis coach Tic Price resigned at the start of this year. Johnny
Jones is running the Tigers now, but the administration wants a
high-profile guy . . . What's happening at Clemson? The Tigers
already have lost to schools from the MEAC, Midwestern Collegiate
Conference, and Southern Conference, with home losses to South
Carolina State and Wofford, two in-state rivals. That would be like
Northeastern beating BC at Conte Forum. Well, maybe not this season
. . . Mississippi might be this season's sleeper in the SEC. The
Rebels are 9-1, with only a loss at Oklahoma marring their record.
``We're good,'' said Ole Miss coach Rod Barnes. ``We're not a great
basketball team by any stretch of the imagination.'' . . . The ACC
is back to its old tricks, with five of its nine teams ranked in
the Top 25: North Carolina (6), Duke (10), Maryland (17), Wake
Forest (23), and North Carolina State (25). The last time the four
North Carolina teams wre ranked in the same poll was Dec. 20, 1960
. . . Duke has not lost to a non-conference in-state opponent since
1981, when Davidson upset the Blue Devils.

   With two losses in three games in Puerto Rico, UMass basketball
is in crisis. Coach Bruiser Flint basically knew entering the
season he not only would have to advance the team into the NCAA
Tournament, but he had to win a game to feel secure about his job.
A 6-5 start, with the Atlantic 10 season still ahead, increases the
sense of urgency . . . Fans of Marshall have yet to see their
football or basketball teams lose this season. The unbeaten
football team will face BYU in the Motor City Bowl next week, while
the basketball team is 8-0, matching its best start since 1973-74 .
. . Trouble in Miami? It looks that way after the Canes' Johnny
Hemsley walked off the court in a middle of a win over Detroit in a
tournament game in Puerto Rico this week. Hurricanes coach Leonard
Hamilton suspended Hemsley for two games, which just adds to the
frustration of the team that is a mediocre 5-5 after a sixth-place
finish in the San Juan Shootout.

HASSELBECK: HIS RED FLAG WAS IGNORED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 20 years ago, when he was playing tight end for the New
England Patriots, when Don Hasselbeck cautioned the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them they should change,'' said Hasselbeck. ``I called
the league office a couple of times when the season was over, but I
guess no one ever paid attention to me. Nothing changed. Now this
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, 1979, during the final game of the season in
Foxborough, Hasselbeck was cut in the face with a flag thrown by an
official and needed six stitches. ``I thought I was shot,'' said
Hasselbeck. ``It knocked me right to the ground. I was in
tremendous pain. I put my hand up to my mouth and there was blood
all over the place. I looked down, and there was this metal sinker,
like you fish with, on the ground right in front of me. That's what
the official had in his flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward 20 years and three days to Dec. 19, 1999. In
Cleveland, referee Jeff Triplette threw a flag and hit Browns
offensive lineman Orlando Brown in the eye. Brown responded by
knocking Triplette to the ground, and has been suspended
indefinitely. He is still hospitalized with potentially permanent
eye damage.
</P>
<P>
   Triplette's flag contained small metal pellets to give it
weight, as opposed to the sinker that dropped Hasselbeck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing the Minnesota Vikings and going in for a
score. I was blocking Jim Marshall. He was 41 years old, and I
still held him,'' said Hasselbeck, laughing at himself. ``I saw the
official (field judge) at the back of the end zone throw the flag
in my direction. I didn't pay any attention to it except that I was
mad for getting caught holding. Next thing I knew it hit me.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took me into the locker room. My lip was split from the
bottom of my nose down. If I didn't have a mouthpiece in, I would
have had my teeth knocked out. As it was, my teeth were a little
loose. They stitched me up and I played the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of months later, during the offseason, I called the
NFL office and asked them what was going to be done about it. I
never got a straight answer.''
</P>
<P>
   At times there are ``spot penalties'' in football, and the
officials are supposed to throw their flag to the spot where the
foul occurred. A flag with no weight to it would not reach the
spot, or blow away. So officials are told to put their own weight
in the flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend popcorn (kernels),'' says Jerry Seeman, head of
officals, ``and small BBs like Jeff used in this case. It was an
unfortunate accident. The right guard moved on the play before the
snap so Jeff threw his flag toward the right guard and Brown (at
right tackle) was going in that direction when he got hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the spin the Browns are trying to put on the incident,
Brown is described by former teammates and coaches as a violent
person with a quick trigger. They are not suprised he went off on
the official. In Baltimore, he had to be prevented by his teammates
from trying to attack a sportswriter on the practice field.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if he really wanted to, he could have hurt Triplette,
because Brown is one of the strongest guys in the league, which is
why he has the nickname ``Zeus.'' Brown originally was a free agent
nobody wanted. He was ready to sign on with World Wrestling
Federation when the Browns signed him for $100. During his first
workout, he hit the blocking sled so hard, the guy holding it flew
through the air and separated a shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Those feeling sorry for Brown should remember there have been
probably hundreds of officials who have been run over and injured
by NFL players in accidents during games, and not one has sued a
player yet.

   The Red Sox were so close to signing Orel Hershiser they were
preparing an announcement when he opted for Los Angeles instead.
``We thought we had him,'' said Red Sox general manager Dan
Duquette. ``He was going to come to us, and then the Dodgers, who
hadn't shown any interest, suddenly got into it, so Orel decided to
close out his career with the team he started with. If they didn't
get into it, I'm confident we would have had him.'' Duquette said
that what encouraged to Sox to sign 36-year-old Jeff Fassero was
the finish he had last season. ``He had elbow surgery in September
of 1998, and many times it takes a pitcher two years to get back to
where he was,'' said Duquette. ``We looked at him in the final
month of the season when he was with Texas and felt he was throwing
better than he did all of last year. We needed a lefthanded
pitcher. We're still going to sign another pitcher before training
camp, and try to pick up a free agent righthanded bat who might
surprise us in training camp.''

   Bobby Orr didn't want to say much about the young man except:
``He is a terrific kid, with great talent, who works hard, who
wants to be good, and who comes from a terrific family.'' Orr was
talking about Jason Spezza, a 16-year-old phenom currently playing
with the Canadian National Junior Team who is being billed as the
next, well, Bobby Orr. Orr is a consultant to his family and wants
to stay in the background. But hockey types who have seen Spezza
play in juniors north of the border say he could be the real deal.
Spezza is over 6 feet already, and even though he is two years away
from the big show, he has a can't-miss label on him already.

   The Eagles' Troy Vincent had a big game against the Patriots
last Sunday, with two interceptions, and he didn't like what he saw
in New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe's eyes toward the end of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad for him,'' said Vincent on his Philadelphia radio
show Monday night. ``In the fourth period you could see fear in his
eyes. He could see we were coming hard with the pass rush and they
couldn't block it. He knew he has going to get hit again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only normal to look at way he did, after the hits he
took all afternoon. Any other quarterback who ever played the game
would have looked the same way. All day long we just rushed more
people than they could block, and that allowed us (defensive backs)
to play more aggressive and go after the ball.''

   There is no logical reason for middle linebacker Ted Johnson,
after being injured most of the season, and playing now with a
brace on his arm, to play the final two games for New England,
which is out of the playoffs. Hopefully, before kickoff Sunday
someone wakes up at Foxboro Stadium and gets him off the field. The
team would be better served by putting Andy Katzenmoyer back on the
field to gain more experience, and making sure Johnson is 100
percent for next season . . . Vinny Vecchione, fight manager:
``They're going to have to create a super heavyweight division in
boxing. These guys are getting bigger all the time. I saw a couple
of Russians recently that were 6-6, 6-7. How can you ask someone
190 pounds (the heavyweight minimum) to go up against guys like
that?''

   According to the New York Times's most recent NFL computer
rankings, the Oakland Raiders have played the toughest schedule in
the league this year, with their opponents compiling an 86-68
record. Now here are two schedules to pay attention to when
evaluating the playoffs. St. Louis, which will be favored to win
the NFC, has played the easiest schedule, with opponents combining
for 53 wins and 74 losses. Jacksonville, most likely the pick in
the AFC, has the second-easist schedule, its foes compiling 55 wins
and 86 losses. The Patriots have played the softest schedule in the
AFC East (69-73), and the Jets the toughest (82-58).

   The strangest scene your humble servant ever witnessed involving
a player and official in the NFL came in a game in Baltimore when
Bert Jones was playing QB for the ``original'' Colts. Jones,
scrambling with time running out in the first half, was on the
ground and sliding out of bounds near the Patriot bench. The field
judge in those days fired a starter's pistol with blanks to signify
the end of the half, and the game. As Jones was sliding toward him,
the field judge was too busy paying attention to his watch, and
just about the time Jones arrived at his feet, he fired it. Jones
1) thought he was shot; 2) thought he may have been dead; and 3)
rolled around on the ground for a long time holding both hands over
the earholes of his helmet. ``We had one like that once with the
Giants in Yankee Stadium,'' said Art McNally, retired former head
of officials in the NFL. ``Our of our guys (a field judge) got a
little bit excited and fired off the gun at the two-minute warning
by mistake. Andy Robustelli of the Giants had been in the service
and hit the ground, thinking someone was shooting at him. When he
got up, let's just say he wasn't so happy with our guy.'' But he
didn't knock him down either.

   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ In this little town, the traditional
birthplace of Jesus, the Palestinian police stood guard on the
rooftops of Manger Square on Friday night as Italian nuns prayed
with clasped hands, American gospel choirs belted out carols and
Filipina immigrants wearing Santa hats boogied on plastic chairs.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just the prelude to a long, surreal Christmas Eve
in the newly refurbished town, where Christian spirituality,
Palestinian nationalism and party fever intermingled beneath
gold-laced trees. The eve built in a crescendo to a midnight Mass
featuring Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , accompanied by
assorted leftist leaders of the world, and rolled into Christmas
Day with fireworks and a Middle Eastern banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Above the square a new clock, a present from Athens, counted
down the days, hours and minutes to the third millennium while
television cameras from around the globe _ a thousand journalists
had registered _ trained themselves on the crowds of pilgrims,
tourists and locals that built steadily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you direct me to Nativity Square?'' asked Kevin Brown, an
Englishman with a five-o'clock-shadow and a backpack. When told he
was there, he looked around and said, ``Wow! It looks nothing like
the Christmas cards. Wow! It's a dharma-like thing to be at this
site at the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jerusalem quieted to a rainy whisper with the onset of the
Jewish sabbath at sundown Friday, the sleepy town of Bethlehem came
to life in a way that approached Arafat's vision of a
Palestinian-ruled international crossroads. Arafat has invested
heavily _ $270 million in foreign dollars and a good deal of
rhetoric _ in putting Bethlehem on the millennial map, as a lure
for pilgrims and international recognition alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manger Square's not a parking lot anymore,'' said Tony Paris,
a Jerusalem resident from Atlanta, as he addressed dozens of
postcards to be postmarked ``Bethlehem, Dec. 25'' and sent to
friends and relatives in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Friday, Manger Square filled with Muslims who spilled
out of the mosque, lit for the day with Christmas green, that faces
the Church of the Nativity. Arafat, a Muslim, had joined them in
Friday prayers, starting his day by observing the holy month of
Ramadan and ending it with a Mass. The Muslims kneeled between
police barricades as Christian tourists politely watched.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Latin patriarch, the Rev. Michel Sabbath, a native
Nazarene wearing flowing pink robes, rolled through the bumpy
streets of town, flanked by Palestinian police on horses. His
procession of some 150 altar boys was led by a Palestinian man
dressed in an Ottoman-era costume with a sword in his waistband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this just beautiful?'' asked Suha Arafat, Arafat's wife,
who was raised as a Christian, while she waited with foreign
dignitaries and scores of bodyguards to greet him at the church.
</P>
<P>
   Ducking through a pint-sized door in the church's battered
facade, tourists queued up to descend into the grotto that is
considered Jesus' birthplace. Pilgrims from Jakarta filled the
cave, singing ``Silent Night'' in Indonesian as one by one they
approached, kneeled and kissed the star of Bethlehem. One young
woman, tears rolling down her face, was so overcome with emotion
that she had to be helped back up the stone stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a worldwide terrorism alert, the tourists seemed utterly
unconcerned. Jorgen Fischer of Germany wore an ``I (LOVE)
Palestine'' sticker on his lapel. ``The terrorists wouldn't attack
the Palestinians, would they?'' he said. ``This is probably one of
the safest places on the planet earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with sporadically heavy rains, the crowd grew thicker as
the night grew wetter. Three soggy Santas patrolled the streets
atop a local rental car, bravely ringing their bells into the mist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who runs this? The Jews?'' asked a pilgrim from New Delhi,
Laxmi Batav, who like several foreigners interviewed, did not know
Bethlehem is a Palestinian town.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign workers from Israel, especially Nigerians and
Filipinos, showed up in full regalia. But half those who attended
were Israeli Arabs or Palestinians, many of them Muslims, turning
out not so much to commemorate Jesus as to be there, in force.
(Most Palestinian Christians are Orthodox and celebrate Christmas
on Jan. 7).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are coming here to participate with our brothers in their
celebrations,'' said Ashraf Yassini, 38, a Muslim who came with his
family of seven. ``It expresses a kind of unity, our presence here.
It's a beautiful feeling to witness the presence of the Palestinian
Authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Nassar, a Palestinian Christian who runs a photo store,
said many friends of his, including priests, would not attend the
Mass because it was not primarily a religious event. ``It has
become not a time of prayer but a time to show all the world who is
ruling here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Palestinians took control of the town in 1995,
Christmas Eve has turned into a pride day and, for the young, a
staid social scene. During the evening, a line of teen-agers belted
out ``Jingle Bells'' in Arabic as they sat cross-legged, their arms
linked, in Manger Square.
</P>
<P>
   But when a James Brown-style rhythm and blues band took to the
stage, young Palestinian men turned the square into a mosh pit,
much to the chagrin of a group of Japanese nuns. ``We thought we
were coming for an outdoor Mass,'' said one horrified Sister of
Charity.
</P>
<P>
   The midnight Mass, held in the Franciscan Church of St.
Catherine adjacent to the Church of the Nativity, was a
ticket-holders event. After a substantial delay, it was broadcast
to the big screens outside. Relieved, the Japanese sisters and some
nuns from Ireland witnessed a first-time event in the Holy Land,
where the Christian denominations are divided and sometimes
warring: Eastern clerics celebrated the Mass with Roman Catholic
priests in a nod to the turn of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat entered late, taking a seat in the front row beside his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   She wore black lace on her head, he his keffiyeh. When she
offered to share her prayerbook, he brushed it away with one hand.
Then he was brought his own.
</P>
<P>
   Standing, Arafat and his wife bowed together in prayer, and as
Christmas Day began, a hush fell over the crowd in the square.

MCCAIN'S UNMATCHED AVAILABILITY YIELDS GOOD RELATIONS WITH PRESS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (mk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ No one could accuse John McCain of shirking
his obligations to the newspaper readers of Norway. For 30 minutes
of his precious campaign time the other day, the senator from
Arizona took questions from a reporter from Oslo as the two sat in
the back of the bus that his staff has christened the Straight Talk
Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really appreciate being on the bus with you,'' Anne
Thurmann-Nielsen, correspondent for the Norwegian daily Dagbladet,
said as the exchange wound down.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate winked. ``Well, we do feel the critical vote in
this campaign will be out in Minnesota,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other journalists on the bus, representing news
organizations as diverse as ABC News and The Arizona Daily Star of
Tucson, laughed at the senator's allusion to the Midwestern state's
large population of Scandinavian-Americans. But in his wry
acknowledgement that this encounter was unlikely to help him win a
single vote, McCain was actually telling a joke on himself, one
that everyone on the bus was in on: These days, he never meets an
interviewer he doesn't like.
</P>
<P>
   Among political reporters, the extraordinary access that McCain
provides has become the stuff of instant legend, and it is not only
the Norwegian media that has benefited. Opportunities for face time
with the other major candidates tend to be limited and fiercely
regimented. ``I was on the campaign with Gore, but he was on the
other bus,'' Ms. Thurmann-Nielsen said of her inability to get
close to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for hour after hour, McCain takes on all comers on the
Straight Talk Express as it crosses early primary states like New
Hampshire and South Carolina. In fact, this maverick Republican
conservative will spar and ruminate, banter and cajole, kick back
and hold forth for as long as anyone with a pad or a microphone
cares. And sometimes, even longer.
</P>
<P>
   The result: an unusually tension-free relationship between the
press and a candidate from a wing of a party that has often viewed
journalists as the enemy. Indeed, some in the conservative movement
are so deeply resentful of McCain's clubbiness with the press and
incredulous at the huge amount of attention he has garnered _
earlier this month, for instance, Time ran his photo on the cover
and a package of five stories on his candidacy _ that they detect a
strong whiff of favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much like the boomlet for Colin Powell,'' declared Tim
Graham, director of media analysis for the Media Research Center, a
conservative think tank. ``There is the hero part, and they're
liking this guy because he's fun, he's very candid. To me, it's
disturbing that the biggest test for deciding who's presidential
timber is which candidate is the fastest returning your phone
call.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham reported in the weekly press release that the center
calls its ``Media Reality Check'' that between Sept. 27 and Dec.
10, McCain, his wife, Cindy, and his campaign manager appeared on
``Good Morning America'' eight times, or once ``every nine days.''
During the same period, he said, the other Republican candidates
were on once or never.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters dismiss the idea that a ride on the Straight Talk
Express means a free ride for the candidate. But they sure do like
the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unique,'' said Joe Klein, political writer for The New
Yorker and author of the Clinton-years novel ``Primary Colors,'' as
he rode the bus from Cambridge, Mass., to this historic seafaring
city on New Hampshire's tiny coastline. ``Most politicians, even at
this stage, don't give the level of access that he's giving now.''
</P>
<P>
   And reporters suspect that any minute, they and the senator will
awake from this dream, and the candidate will trade in his plush
recliner in the back of the bus for the enveloping cocoon of his
strategists and media consultants at the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long can you keep this up, the letting us grill you for
hours?'' Dana Millbank, a New Republic writer, asked the senator
one evening on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, McCain replied. ``This is one thing I can't
change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the race, McCain's staff tried their best to change
him, to get him to follow the unwritten political commandment that
says, Thou shalt not be too available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trained to parcel out access, to vet every
question,'' said John Weaver, the campaign's political director.
``But he refused, and finally we just surrendered. And you know, he
was right. Not every candidate can do this, but what we've
discovered is, so what if he makes a mistake? The interesting thing
is that the more the press sees the candidate is a real person, the
more likely they'll be to give him a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and other aides to McCain say that reporters may find the
candidate appealing for the same reasons as the public. He is a
charismatic speaker and a natural object of admiration, having
emerged from five and a half years in a North Vietnamese prison
with his sense of humor intact. But even if some reporters say they
do like him, it is for the most part an attraction born of
pragmatism. ``He's good copy, and he returns my phone calls,'' said
one veteran Washington correspondent.

</P>
<P>
   Klein, who pointed out that this is the seventh New Hampshire
presidential primary he has covered, acknowledged that the question
of how much extra slack reporters may cut McCain is a tough one.
The potentially damaging episodes of the senator's past _ his
involvement in the Keating Five affair, the reports of his angry
outbursts _ have been widely reported. But would the reporters pull
out their cell phones if a gaffe were committed on the Straight
Talk Express? Klein said he might not, but not because of his
feelings about McCain. ``I have a `no gotcha' rule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The romance of the sharp-tongued McCain and a demanding press
corps is, of course, more complex than it appears.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case with veteran lawmakers, he and his hometown
paper, The Arizona Republic of Phoenix, have feuded off and on,
over such issues as the content of its editorial cartoons and his
reputation for being quick to anger. ``It's never been a good
relationship,'' the senator said. And the campaign acknowledged
misstepping when it tried recently to control a sensitive story,
the release of McCain's medical records, by giving it early to
selected reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Salkowski, a technology reporter for the Tucson paper who
traveled with the candidate for several days last week, said that
while he found the senator ``good to deal with _ he'll return my
calls,'' some of his Arizona colleagues found him mercurial. ``The
perception is, he is more difficult to deal with than his national
reputation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Straight Talk Express, however, the atmosphere of all
candor all the time bathes the campaign in a nonconfrontational
informality. The bus design itself contributes to the feeling. It
is more Winnebago than standard-issue charter, with kitchen and
shower and couches built into the walls. McCain genuinely seems to
like reporters; he not only knows their names, he reads their
stories. He talks politics and policy but also boxing and books and
history and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I do it is because I enjoy it,'' he said
one afternoon, as the bus descended from the White Mountains on the
way to Manchester. ``Some of the smartest people I've ever met are
in the media, and some of the dumbest people I've ever met are in
the media.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about an insatiable appetite for spectator sports _
``I would watch guys picking up refrigerators,'' was how he put it
_ and an aversion to being ``handled,'' saying, ``I won't take
security: I don't need it, I don't like it, I don't want it.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered innocuous quips about well-known politicians and
praise for the press for its hands-off treatment of Chelsea
Clinton, and when asked about it afterward by Salkowski, a mea
culpa for overstating his legislative achievements in an interview
with a radio reporter. ``That was a bit disingenuous,'' he
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters are taken aback by all the attention. A look of
something like shock comes over the faces of some newcomers to the
Straight Talk Express as it dawns on them that this candidate
actually wants to sit next to them. The thought is expressed by
some professional skeptics _ reporters, pundits and politicians _
that it is a ploy, that the guarantee of access translates to
better coverage, and that this partly accounts for McCain's growing
popularity with the voters here.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, for one, thinks not. ``It's not us,'' he said, referring
to McCain's surge in various polls in New Hampshire. ``If it were
us, Bruce Babbitt would have been elected president. There's always
a press favorite in a campaign, and it's usually the loser.''

   HOPE-MEMORIES (Los Angeles) -- For five decades, they crawled
out of foxholes and walked out of jungles and deserts to see him.
Mr. Christmas. And he never let them down, and they've never
forgotten him for it. It was how her husband unwound after coming
home from another Christmas tour to somewhere in the world where
America's soldiers needed a shot in the arm. ``It was the part that
gave him more satisfaction than anything, meeting the men and
seeing them smile,'' she said. ``For a few hours, he replaced their
fear and loneliness with laughs. And now, at 96, Bob Hope says
thanks for the memories. By Dennis McCarthy (Will move on the ``n''

   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ In this little town, the traditional
birthplace of Jesus, the Palestinian police stood guard on the
rooftops of Manger Square on Friday night as Italian nuns prayed
with clasped hands, American gospel choirs belted out carols and
Filipino immigrants wearing Santa hats boogied on plastic chairs.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just the prelude to a long, surreal Christmas Eve
in the newly refurbished town, where Christian spirituality,
Palestinian nationalism and party fever intermingled beneath
gold-laced trees. The eve built in a crescendo to a midnight Mass
featuring Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, accompanied by assorted
leftist leaders of the world, and rolled into Christmas Day with
fireworks and a Middle Eastern banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Above the square a new clock, a present from Athens, counted
down the days, hours and minutes to the third millennium while
television cameras from around the globe _ a thousand journalists
had registered _ trained themselves on the crowds of pilgrims,
tourists and locals that built steadily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you direct me to Nativity Square?'' asked Kevin Brown, an
Englishman with a five-o'clock-shadow and a backpack. When told he
was there, he looked around and said, ``Wow! It looks nothing like
the Christmas cards. Wow! It's a dharma-like thing to be at this
site at the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jerusalem quieted to a rainy whisper with the onset of the
Jewish sabbath at sundown Friday, the sleepy town of Bethlehem came
to life in a way that approached Arafat's vision of a
Palestinian-ruled international crossroads. Arafat has invested
heavily _ $270 million in foreign dollars and a good deal of
rhetoric _ in putting Bethlehem on the millennial map, as a lure
for pilgrims and international recognition alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manger Square's not a parking lot anymore,'' said Tony Paris,
a Jerusalem resident from Atlanta, as he addressed dozens of
postcards to be postmarked ``Bethlehem, Dec. 25'' and sent to
friends and relatives in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Friday, Manger Square filled with Muslims who spilled
out of the mosque, lit for the day with Christmas green, that faces
the Church of the Nativity. Arafat, a Muslim, had joined them in
Friday prayers, starting his day by observing the holy month of
Ramadan and ending it with a Mass. The Muslims kneeled between
police barricades as Christian tourists politely watched.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Latin patriarch, the Rev. Michel Sabbath, a native
Nazarene wearing flowing pink robes, rolled through the bumpy
streets of town, flanked by Palestinian police on horses. His
procession of some 150 altar boys was led by a Palestinian man
dressed in an Ottoman-era costume with a sword in his waistband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this just beautiful?'' asked Suha Arafat, Arafat's wife,
who was raised as a Christian, while she waited with foreign
dignitaries and scores of bodyguards to greet him at the church.
</P>
<P>
   Ducking through a pint-sized door in the church's battered
facade, tourists queued up to descend into the grotto that is
considered Jesus' birthplace. Pilgrims from Jakarta filled the
cave, singing ``Silent Night'' in Indonesian as one by one they
approached, kneeled and kissed the star of Bethlehem. One young
woman, tears rolling down her face, was so overcome with emotion
that she had to be helped back up the stone stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a worldwide terrorism alert, the tourists seemed utterly
unconcerned. Joergen Fischer of Germany wore an ``I (LOVE)
Palestine'' sticker on his lapel. ``The terrorists wouldn't attack
the Palestinians, would they?'' he said. ``This is probably one of
the safest places on the planet earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with sporadically heavy rains, the crowd grew thicker as
the night grew wetter. Three soggy Santas patrolled the streets
atop a local rental car, bravely ringing their bells into the mist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who runs this? The Jews?'' asked a pilgrim from New Delhi,
Laxmi Batav, who like several foreigners interviewed, did not know
Bethlehem is a Palestinian town.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign workers from Israel, especially Nigerians and
Filipinos, showed up in full regalia. But half those who attended
were Israeli Arabs or Palestinians, many of them Muslims, turning
out not so much to commemorate Jesus as to be there, in force.
(Most Palestinian Christians are Orthodox and celebrate Christmas
on Jan. 7).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are coming here to participate with our brothers in their
celebrations,'' said Ashraf Yassini, 38, a Muslim who came with his
family of seven. ``It expresses a kind of unity, our presence here.
It's a beautiful feeling to witness the presence of the Palestinian
Authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Nassar, a Palestinian Christian who runs a photo store,
said many friends of his, including priests, would not attend the
Mass because it was not primarily a religious event. ``It has
become not a time of prayer but a time to show all the world who is
ruling here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Palestinians took control of the town in 1995,
Christmas Eve has turned into a pride day and, for the young, a
staid social scene. During the evening, a line of teen-agers belted
out ``Jingle Bells'' in Arabic as they sat cross-legged, their arms
linked, in Manger Square.
</P>
<P>
   But when a James Brown-style rhythm and blues band took to the
stage, young Palestinian men turned the square into a mosh pit,
much to the chagrin of a group of Japanese nuns. ``We thought we
were coming for an outdoor Mass,'' said one horrified Sister of
Charity.
</P>
<P>
   The midnight Mass, held in the Franciscan Church of St.
Catherine adjacent to the Church of the Nativity, was a
ticket-holders event. After a substantial delay, it was broadcast
to the big screens outside. Relieved, the Japanese sisters and some
nuns from Ireland witnessed a first-time event in the Holy Land,
where the Christian denominations are divided and sometimes
warring: Eastern clerics celebrated the Mass with Roman Catholic
priests in a nod to the turn of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat entered late, taking a seat in the front row beside his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   She wore black lace on her head, he his keffiyeh. When she
offered to share her prayerbook, he brushed it away with one hand.
Then he was brought his own.
</P>
<P>
   Standing, Arafat and his wife bowed together in prayer, and as
Christmas Day began, a hush fell over the crowd in the square.

   PLOIESTI, Romania _ There probably is not another Raytheon
office campus on earth where mangy dogs and underdressed students
of the manicure arts wander the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   But it is here, in the dormitories of a run-down vocational high
school, that Raytheon is joining America's experiment with
Romania's distorted economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is going so well that the company is erecting a new $8
million office building across town. Instead of being upstairs from
the car-repair, dressmaking and barber classes, Raytheon will be
next door to Ploiesti's lone citadel of higher education: The
University of Oil and Gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``No liberal arts here,'' chuckled Peter Stephenson, general
manager of Raytheon's 300-people operation, which he plans to
expand to 500. ``You've got to be an oil-or-gas man. And we'll do
our recruiting next door.''
</P>
<P>
   In cities across Romania, American companies are taking
advantage of one of the legacies of Romania's dictator, Nicolae
Ceausescu, who ruled for 25 years before he was overthrown and
executed in 1989: obsessed with industrialization, he nearly
bankrupted his country building huge steel mills, oil refineries
and factories. Many now lie rusting; but the engineering schools he
grafted onto Romania's already excellent school system are still
pumping out graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Romania, according to the Romanian-American Capital and Trade
Development Group, is top-heavy with engineers and has twice the
number of computer-science graduates per capita that the United
States does and seven times India's.
</P>
<P>
   And they work cheap. The economics can be compelling to
companies like Raytheon, the defense contractor based in Lexington,
Mass. The average Romanian earns $1,000 a year; an engineer only
twice that. For less than $5,000 a year, a foreign company can hire
the best and brightest here to do work for which it would pay at
least $60,000 a year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Other American engineering companies here include Cambric
Consulting of Draper, Utah, which has 300 employees, and Harza
Engineering of Chicago, which builds hydroelectric plants and has
an agreement with the national Hydroelectric Institute to
``borrow'' 100 of its engineers for big projects. The institute's
engineers earn paltry Romanian government salaries when there is no
work, but several times that when Harza has work for them.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be what some American workers want to hear,
especially after the breakdown of World Trade Organization talks in
Seattle early this month. But there is' not even a loading dock
they can picket. In place of a giant sucking sound made by these
jobs going overseas is the quiet click of an Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether they are costing any American jobs at all.
By providing an extra work force at a time when tens of thousands
of engineering job opportunities are going begging in the United
States, they probably enhance the prospects for American firms in
the global marketplace. Engineers here worked simultaneously with
teams in Princeton, N.J., and Thailand on the design of a new Thai
power plant; the model could reside on a computer in any country
and the Romanians could work on it while the Americans were eating
breakfast and the Thais were fighting the evening rush hour. They
helped design a polystyrene plant for Poland, a chemical plant for
Equatorial Guinea, detergent and cigarette factories for Romania
and a Pringle's potato chip factory for Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   And some Raytheon workers seem quite pleased with their new
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Doina Fortuna, 42, is a design technician who uses the computer
model to extract blueprints for builders. Like approximately half
her Raytheon co-workers, she worked for decades at the Institute
for Petrochemical Installation Design, a government institution
privatized only three months ago. There, she worked on an easel
with pens and T-squares; here she uses a $30,000 desktop computer,
earns nearly triple her old pay, and has been sent to the
Netherlands to learn new software.
</P>
<P>
   She is not bothered by the campus, which despite its run-down
surroundings, has roomy desks, sunlight and rugs on the floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited the institute a year ago, and I was afraid to go in
the corridors because it was too dark, too small,'' she said.
``You'll never see an office such as this there.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Ploiesti is not a pretty city _ aside from the clock museum and
a few other buildings in an architectural style that might be
called Addams Family Gothic, it is full of long rows of grim
Stalinist apartment blocks. If the name sounds familiar, there was
an earlier American connection: the legendary Ploiesti raids of
World War II. Its refineries fueled Hitler's Panzer divisions, and
the Allies were desperate to knock them out. Many bombers, hours
from their bases in Italy, were shot down, and there is still a
British military graveyard just south of town.
</P>
<P>
   Ploiesti's oil boom began well before the internal combustion
engine. Peasants used to dig here for wagon wheel grease, said
Marian Nicolescu, Raytheon's engineering manager, and its oil lit
the streets of European cities back in the days when Pennsylvania,
not Texas, was a wildcatter's dream. There are still five
refineries in Ploiesti, which explains the concentration of
engineering talent.
</P>
<P>
   Cambric Consulting, probably the second-largest American
employer of Romanian engineers and computer specialists, has 300
people in offices in Brasov and Cluj. Brasov contains Romania's
truck and tractor factories, and Cluj has industries and technical
universities. Much of the work done for Cambric is converting
two-dimensional drawings of engines and parts to three-dimensional
computer models for clients like John Deere and Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   Cambric's engineers are paid about $3,600 a year, with
incentives for on-time work that can double their salaries. It also
saves money on computers and software licensing fees by having its
work stations in use 18 hours a day; employees work nine-hour
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Similar work is done in India, but Cambric closed its
300-employee office in India three years ago and expanded its
Romania operation from 12 engineers to 300. Asked about that,
Viorel Scortaru Pasca, deputy manager of the Brasov plant, replied:
``What I heard was that the customers complained that the Indian
engineers would say: `Here's a problem. What do we do?,' while the
Romanian engineers would say: `Here's a problem. Here's how to
solve it.' They were more creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson, a native of Australia, said he found Romanian
engineers to be so highly educated ``that we're probably
overqualified _ even our human resources lady is a welding
engineer. That's the beauty of what you find here.'' Fluency in
English is about 50 percent, especially among the young. Older
Romanians often speak French or Russian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem with attitude,'' he said, ``is a little too
much respect for authority. They have trouble unfreezing. I like
people to call me Peter, but there are still some who can't bring
themselves to do that. But as far as the work ethic is concerned,
there is no problem, no Communist hangover _they do what has to be
done.''

ASSOCIATE OF TERROR SUSPECT SOUGHT IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (kd) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Canadian authorities said Friday that they had
issued an arrest warrant for a man believed to be an associate of
Ahmed Ressam, the man who was arrested at a border station in
Washington state and indicted on charges of illegally possessing
explosive materials.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian authorities identified the man they were seeking as
Abdelmajed Dahoumane, who is said to be 32 and the man who for
three weeks shared a motel room in Vancouver, British Columbia,
with Ressam before Ressam tried to enter the United States on Dec.
14 in a rental car.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said that in the car they found vials of
nitroglycerine, more than 100 pounds of urea and digital timing
devices, all of which were components that federal authorities have
said could have been fashioned into a crude but powerful bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials have said that Ressam was accompanied
for at least part of the trip by car ferry from Vancouver to Port
Angeles, Wash., north of Seattle. They initially identified the man
who was with Ressam as Karim Said Atmani, who was said to have
shared an apartment with Ressam in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Friday whether or how Canadian authorities had
come to believe that the man who accompanied Ressam from Canada was
not Atmani but Dahoumane.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was alone when he was stopped at Port Angeles by a
customs inspector, but he was carrying two ticket receipts, leading
officials to theorize that Ressam's companion had boarded a ferry
but returned to Canada before it reached an American port.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ressam was formally charged in federal court in
Seattle with illegally carrying bomb materials. Ressam, who has not
agreed to cooperate with the authorities, could face a maximum
penalty of more than 40 years in prison if convicted. He has
pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The apparently chance discovery of explosives in the car driven
by Ressam has ignited a spate of warnings and alerts in recent days
about the possibility of terrorist acts against Americans, even as
the authorities continue to emphasize that they have no evidence of
any specific acts planned in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The officials have said that they suspect Ressam is associated
with people who appear to be linked to terrorist organizations,
possibly the loose network of Islamic militants whose inspirational
leader, Osama bin Laden, has been indicted as the mastermind behind
the bombings of American embassies in East Africa in 1998. But the
officials have acknowledged that they cannot explain Ressam's plan
or motives for trying to bring explosive materials into the United
States.

   HOLIDAY-SHOPPING (Undated) _ The season started at 4:30 a.m. the
day after Thanksgiving with shoppers lining up outside Toys ``R''
Us in Atlanta to buy Pokemon cards _ and it built from there.
Yahoo, the leading Internet portal, recorded more purchases through
its Web site in five days this month than it did during the entire
1998 holiday season. In New York, the Gap ran out of $175 leather
pants so fast that the sight of shoppers breaking into tears of
frustration became common. The millennium celebration may turn out
to be a bust, but by any measure Christmas 1999 was swinging. By

   HOLIDAY-SHOPPING (Undated) _ The season started at 4:30 a.m. the
day after Thanksgiving with shoppers lining up outside Toys ``R''
Us in Atlanta to buy Pokemon cards _ and it built from there.
Yahoo, the leading Internet portal, recorded more purchases through
its Web site in five days this month than it did during the entire
1998 holiday season. In New York, the Gap ran out of $175 leather
pants so fast that the sight of shoppers breaking into tears of
frustration became common. The millennium celebration may turn out
to be a bust, but by any measure Christmas 1999 was swinging. By

OFFICIAL RESIGNS AFTER CHARGES OF BRUTALITY IN JUVENILE JAILS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   (rk) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The head of California's troubled juvenile corrections service
has resigned amid demands by state officials for a stronger
response to brutality in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Gregorio S. Zermeno, 53, director of the California Youth
Authority, was forced to resign on Wednesday after only 10 months
on the job. He was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement announcing the resignation, which becomes
effective in 45 days, Robert Presley, the state corrections
secretary, said, ``It has become apparent that the problems of the
Youth Authority require aggressive action and specialized
management skills to turn the department around.
</P>
<P>
   While Zermeno, a 28-year veteran of the authority, had only been
in the job a short time, his resignation was not unexpected. He
still needed to win confirmation from the state Senate by March, a
prospect that was questionable after the state inspector general
earlier this year found a wide range of abuses at the authority's
unit in Chino.
</P>
<P>
   John Burton, the state Senate leader, wrote Gov. Gray Davis on
Sept. 30 that he could not support Zermeno's confirmation. Burton,
a Democrat, said there was a need for a director ``who can
recognize some of these problems himself and take steps to address
them rather than be directed to do so as the result of an outside
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Youth Authority, which oversees about 7,700 youth offenders,
has come under increasing scrutiny since the earlier investigation
that focused on abuses at the Heman G. Stark Youth Correctional
Facility in Chino. The investigation, which was ordered by Davis,
found that wards at the site, the state's largest youth prison, had
been handcuffed and slammed into walls, shot at close range with
potentially lethal riot guns and had been forcibly injected with
anti-psychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found that a practice of reviewing whether
inmates could be integrated with the general population had grown
into ``the Friday Night Fights.'' While the practice started with
youths' being placed together in monitored confinement for an hour
to review their compatibility, it became a situation where rival
gang members would be forced to confront one another.
</P>
<P>
   The practice was discontinued after Davis issued a directive on
Sept. 24. He also asked the department to initiate a number of
other steps, including a review of use-of-force policies, changes
in the way unruly inmates are removed from their cells, an audit of
the ward grievance policy and elimination of polygraphs as a basis
for whether to investigate such complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Zermeno's resignation comes a week after the head of juvenile
justice in Maryland was fired following reports that guards had
been brutalizing youths in three military-style boot camps for
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   California's youth correctional system has become more
complicated in recent years, with more teen-agers' being
incarcerated for serious crimes, officials noted, and the abuses
seem to have grown as the system tried to handle the more serious
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are coming in a lot younger, a lot more violent and with
a lot of problems,'' said Terri Delgadillo, acting under secretary
of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency. ``We need to get some
strong leadership to make sure we are adequately addressing the
change in population.''
</P>
<P>
   As Zermeno's resignation was announced, The Los Angeles Times
published a report detailing temporary detainment in correctional
facility gyms, a practice in which juvenile offenders are
handcuffed and made to kneel for long periods. The newspaper, which
focused on practices at the El Paso de Robles Youth Correctional
Facility, said the detainees would sleep on thin mattresses at
night, subject to hourly handcuff checks by guards. Those unable to
wait for bathroom breaks were left to sit in urine-soaked clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Delgadillo said the practice was used when there was a need
to separate 15 or more inmates and was under review.

BRAZIL, LEADING LATIN AMERICA IN TECHNOLOGY, BRACES FOR Y2K
PROBLEMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Conn.)   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Approximately 37,000 clients of Banco Itau
SA, one of Brazil's largest banks, got a glimpse last month of the
problems Latin Americans might encounter from the Year 2000
computer problem when they received a letter saying certain fees
would be charged to their accounts as of Jan. 4, 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, which attributed the mix-up to human error and not to
its technology, quickly remedied the problem with follow-up
correspondence correcting the date to 2000. But doubts remained
since Itau was said to be among the region's best prepared
companies for the Year 2000, after investing more than $30 million
to prepare its computers for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   With a week to go, no one is quite sure what the fallout will be
from Latin America's mixed approach to dealing with the Year 2000
bug. According to analysts dealing with the problem, some of the
region's poorest countries, like Paraguay, are dramatically
ill-prepared, while other nations, like Chile and Mexico, planned
ahead and budgeted funds to sufficiently adapt their government
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there appears to be a consensus emerging among the
people who have been rushing to prepare the region for the year
2000: The parts of Latin America most at risk are also the most
technologically advanced, while the most underdeveloped regions,
while they will almost surely also be affected by the bug, are not
likely to suffer as much as the region's pockets of relative
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like bank robber logic,'' said Dale Vecchio, a research
director at the Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn.-based consulting
firm that has examined preparations for the bug around the world.
``Bank robbers search out the bank with the most money, just like
Y2K will affect the societies with the most technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere in Latin America is this relation played out
with greater tension than in Brazil, the region's largest country
with 165 million people. While many parts of Brazil are relatively
underdeveloped and not that dependent on technology, cities like
Sao Paulo are highly wired. Ground zero for Brazil's race to
prepare for the bug could be said to be along the banks of the
Pinheiros, a murky river flowing through this city.
</P>
<P>
   Flanking the Pinheiros are several dozen skyscrapers that
developers built over the last decade as Brazil opened its economy
in an embrace of foreign technology and investment. These
structures, wired with state-of-the-art fiber optics, guarded by a
legion of armed security personnel and topped with helicopter
landing pads, have spent the last year under preparations to deal
with the Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   For Sylvio Roth, the technician in charge adapting computer
systems for Jones Lang LaSalle, the London-based
skyscraper-management firm that manages some of Sao Paulo's most
exclusive commercial buildings, this means his schedule has been
put into overdrive. Roth heads a team stocking up on electricity
generators, diesel fuel and water supplies. Concerned with the
possibility of a surge in crime after the new year, provisions are
also being made for additional armed security forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've screened our buildings for possible problems, but now
our priority is contingency,'' said Roth. ``We're going to make
sure our clients can do business for five to 10 business days after
the first of the year, but this depends on things outside our
control, like the capacity of electricity utilities and telephone
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, large companies in Brazil are generally
prepared for the Year 2000 problem, thanks in part to the fact that
many state firms, including many utilities, were privatized in
sales to foreign concerns during the last few years. The federal
government has said its computers will prove resistant to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, while it is generally acknowledged that most large
companies could fare fairly well, many small firms which have not
recognized the magnitude of the problem could suffer and put a drag
on some parts of the economy, analysts said. While this mixed
approach has created worries in large countries like Brazil, other
nations, like nearby Paraguay, offer a striking contrast in their
Year 2000 preparations.
</P>
<P>
   The poorest and most politically and economically unstable
member of Mercosur, the customs union also formed by Argentina,
Brazil and Uruguay, Paraguay is considered one of the least
prepared countries for the Year 2000 computer problem. Things were
made worse recently when Walter Schafer, the country's coordinator
to deal with the issue, was dismissed after foreign news reports
called attention to Paraguay's lack of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in power got worried about Paraguay's image
abroad,'' said Schafer in a telephone interview from Asuncion,
Paraguay's capital. ``We Paraguayans have so much else to worry
about that it's no wonder our effort to deal with the bug was too
little, too late, and now almost nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the small country of 5 million seems to have
more pressing problems to deal with. In late November, rumors swept
Asuncion that some members of the armed forces were planning a
coup. Authorities loyal to President Luis Gonzalez Macchi arrested
14 army members suspected of disloyalty.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carlos Guedes, the official at the Inter-American
Development Bank in Washington responsible for coordinating the
institution's efforts to help Latin American countries deal with
the Year 2000 computer problem, Paraguay's situation is similar to
that of other small countries in the region, like Guatemala,
Bolivia and Ecuador. In an attempt to help countries like these
prepare for the problem, the bank this year opened a $200 million
emergency credit line to finance computer upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these countries have been hurt by natural phenomena
like hurricanes and a decline in the prices of their main commodity
exports that make dealing with Y2K more difficult,'' said Guedes.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador is one country in the region that has suffered damage
from natural disasters and, until recently, a weak market for oil,
one of its main exports. Yet in a sign that the situation in places
like Ecuador might actually be better off than some critics expect,
the country, like most other Latin American countries, has an
organized task force to deal with the Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Herrera, the official in charge of the task forces,
said she is confident that crucial parts of the economy, such as
electricity generation, telecommunications, water treatment and air
travel, are prepared for the potential effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're better prepared than a lot of people might expect,''
said Ms. Herrera. ``And we're in constant contact with other task
forces in Latin America, so we know that our efforts are in line
with others.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The saving grace of countries like Ecuador and Paraguay may lie
in their relatively unsophisticated computer networks when compared
with those in rich industrialized nations, or even those in more
prosperous Latin American countries like Chile. Even if problems do
arise, it is unlikely that they will have much of an impact on
bigger trading partners like Brazil or Argentina, since economic
integration is still somewhat low in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Even in those parts of Latin America where the Year 2000
computer problem might actually do damage, it is being shrugged off
by many people without much ado. The relative nonchalance among
Latin Americans to the issue might have something to do with their
approach to the economic, political and social turbulence that have
been common throughout the region's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin Americans tend to be more passionate than their
colleagues above the equator when it comes time to make a
decision,'' said Max Gehringer, a Sao Paulo businessman who writes
a column on corporate culture for Exame, Brazil's leading business
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practical terms this means we either magnify a problem
which really isn't that large or we underestimate something we
don't understand entirely,'' said Gehringer. ``Two things can
happen on the first day of January: Either our companies will enter
in reactive panic or an absence of problems will have us saying,
`See? It was all just hype.'''

CHRISTMAS SPIRIT SURVIVES FAMILY'S EVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELMONT, Mass. For the past 37 years Santa has had to bundle a
few extra sacks in his sleigh to keep the kids smiling at the big
white house on School Street.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas at Raymond and Claire Shea's century-old clapboard
home has never been a simple gift-giving affair. The couple's eight
boys and three girls have seen to that.
</P>
<P>
   And now that the Shea's children are grown, and Papa and Nana
have 17 grandchildren, the anticipation for new hockey skates,
train sets and video games runs even higher.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Christmas has stayed the same at the Shea's
ornament-strewn home since Ray and Claire began trimming trees and
lighting candles there in 1962, things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The cheery chaos of the Shea's household of a generation ago has
passed. The kids, now ranging in age from 29 to 47, often spend
Christmas day in their own homes with their own children. And their
grandchildren live in more typical families, with working moms and
fewer children.
</P>
<P>
   But as Claire prepared for her family's 47th Christmas Eve, a
time when in-laws, spouses and cousins join the immediate family to
also celebrate Ray and one of his son's birthdays, she reflected on
the differences between her children's and grandchildren's
upbringings.
</P>
<P>
   The raucous big-family Christmas of past decades, when children
had to share gifts, has given way to small-family Christmas, when
parents feel compelled to give more presents and lavish more
attention on their fewer children.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the ritual of rounding up the whole family for
Christmas Eve, when the candles still burn in the big Queen
Anne-style home, Claire feels something has been lost through the
long tunnel of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a very different world today,'' said Claire, 68,
whose main profession over the years has been being a mother to her
11 children. ``This used to be a neighborhood with a lot of noise.
But now we never see many of our neighbors. Kids aren't playing as
much as they used to and people keep to themselves a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire and Ray say they're lucky to have raised so many
children. But if they had to do it today, they probably couldn't
foot the cost, let alone stuff all the stockings. Buying enough
clothes, delivering more than a score of daily meals and paying for
their kids to go to school would just be too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be impractical to have a family like ours today,''
Claire said. When Claire wasn't minding her children, she was
helping Ray, who owns a printing shop, where six of the family's
kids now work. ``It's just too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sheas regret that so few couples choose to have large
families these days. In 1997, according to the US Census Bureau,
fewer than 2 percent of American families had six or more children.
</P>
<P>
   Big families have many advantages, they say. Brothers and
sisters competing for everything from attention to the last piece
of cake have to learn to share. They have to learn to distinguish
themselves from one another and they have to become self-reliant,
the Sheas said.
</P>
<P>
   Children in small families, such as Ray and Claire's children's
clans, may get too much attention, come to value possessions more
than relationships and expect things to be done for them, Claire
and Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Their kids learned to be patient, to compromise and to
appreciate what may have been relatively little compared to what
their friends had.
</P>
<P>
   When they wanted to shower before school, they had to wait in
line for the home's only bathroom. When they wanted to wear a
particular sweater or pair of jeans, they had to negotiate with
their brothers or sisters, all of whom shared clothes. When they
wanted to use the phone or watch TV, they had to deal with the fact
that the family only had one phone and one small set.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that if you wanted something, you had to do it
yourself,'' said the Sheas' daughter Mary, now 41 and married with
three boys of her own in Belmont. ``Sure, having a lot of brothers
around when you were a teenager wasn't always easy. But we got
along.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wonder how my parents did it,'' said another
daughter, Patti, 37, once the goalie on the women's US Olympic
field hockey team who lives in Hadley and coaches at the University
of Massachusetts at Amherst. ``But we learned values like
discipline and working hard for what we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there was no privacy, no place to hide,'' said Jim,
34, a software developer living in Arlington with his wife and two
children. ``But the pros definitely outweighed the cons.''
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon wore into the evening, and Ray and Claire set
out the shrimp before their friends and family arrived, they said
even if their grandchildren were losing out by growing up in
smaller families, they weren't much different from their kids.
</P>
<P>
   Papa and Nana still have to hide the family's presents in a
small room next to the attic. They still worry whether the children
will have hoped they got different presents. And they continue to
talk about Santa's imminent arrival, even if the kids know there's
no such thing as Santa.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still get anxious to get and give out their presents,''
Claire said. ``And so do we.''

   A miracle? Maybe, but clearly the miracle champs were Hall of
Famers Dick Williams and Doris Hart. Williams not only lived
through his abbreviated Titanic voyage (six hours in the frigid
Atlantic, frozen stiffer than an undertaker's smile) but went on to
US titles in 1914, and '16. Despite a virulent knee infection as a
child and predictions of lifetime as a cripple, Hart used tennis as
therapy, won US titles in 1944-45, plus all the other majors on
twisted, rickety-looking legs.
</P>
<P>
   Other 20th century milestones:
</P>
<P>
   1905 _ Californian May Sutton, 18, is Wimbledon's first foreign
champ.
</P>
<P>
   1926 _ Promoter C.C. Pyle signs Lenglen and New Yorker Vinnie
Richards to lead his touring troupe, thus introducing playing pros.
</P>
<P>
   1927 _ France's Four Musketeers (Rene Lacoste, Jean Borotra,
Henri Cochet, Jacques Brugnon) break Tilden-powered seven-year US
stranglehold on the Davis Cup, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   1938 _ Californian Moody, synonymous with supremacy, wins eighth
Wimbledon, ending a career of .919 ball, 52 titles (19 majors)
between 1919 and '38, and a 158-match streak. Budge completes first
Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   1953 _ Californian Maureen Connolly, 18, spins the second Grand
Slam.
</P>
<P>
   1962 _ Aussie Laver nails the third Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   1967 _ Aussie Emerson wins French, his 12th major, a male
record.
</P>
<P>
   1968 _ Aussie Rosewall and a local, Virginia Wade, win the first
open, British Hard Court. Ashe scores a singular double, winning
the US Amateur at Longwood, then the US Open, the only amateur to
win a major.
</P>
<P>
   1969 _ Laver, 31, Grand Slams again.
</P>
<P>
   1970 _ Aussie Court, 28, biggest winner of majors, 62 (24 in
singles) registers fith Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   1971 _ Chrissie Craze begins as Evert, 16, debuts with a run to
the semis of the US Open, which she'll win six times. Her
two-fisted backhand starts a trend, bolstered by Connors, Borg.
</P>
<P>
   1973 _ King, 29, beats Bobby Riggs, 55, in the schlockathon
known as the ``Battle of the Sexes,'' pulling a record tennis
crowd, 30,472, to the Astrodome and extraordinary TV ratings,
spurring general interest. New men's union, ATP, shows surprising
solidarity and nerve in boycotting Wimbledon, a protest against the
barring of lodge brother Niki Pilic, who had been suspended by his
Yugoslav federation for skipping a Davis Cup series, showing that
players, not their amateur administrators, would control their
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   1975 _ Navratilova upstages Manolo Orantes's upset of Connors in
US Open final by announcing her defection from Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   1978 _ US Open moves to hard courts at Flushing Meadow. Connors
wins, unique as the champ on three surfaces, previously grass and
clay.
</P>
<P>
   1985 _ Big-serving German Boris Becker, 17, wins Wimbledon, the
first unseeded and most callow champ.
</P>
<P>
   1986 _ Evert wins record seventh French, 18th major, is alone in
winning at least one major for 13th successive years. She beats
Navratilova, but Navratilova has a 43-37 edge in rivalry of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   1988 _ Graf, 19, makes the sixth Grand Slam, adds a gold as
tennis returns to Olympics after 64-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   1989 _ Michael Chang, 17, is youngest French champ, first
American guy to win Paris in 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   1990 _ Navratilova, 33 and a US citizen, wins a record ninth
Wimbledon. Sampras, 19, is youngest US male champ.
</P>
<P>
   1993 _ No. 1 Seles, 19, holding eight majors and headed for
possibly greatest career, is struck down by knife-wielding (perhaps
history-altering) Guenther Parche during a match at Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   1999 _ Graf seizes her last victory, 22d major, the French.
Agassi also wins the French, joining Perry, Budge, Laver, and
Emerson in a select circle, winners of all four majors. Sampras is
Wimbledon's man of the century with a sixth title, equaling
Emerson's 12 majors. Serena Williams, 17, at the US, is the first
black victor in a major since Ashe's 1975 Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>

TENNIS EVOLVED WITH THE TIMES DURING THE 20TH CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In like a lamb; out like a lion.
</P>
<P>
   That was the 20th century journey of the diversion we know as
tennis. Twenty-six years after the game arrived on the scene, a
couple of genteel Brits, clad head-to-sneakered-toes in white,
Blanche Bingley Hillyard and Reggie Doherty, won Wimbledon titles
of 1900. Ushering the century out were the dark-skinned teenage
daughter of a Louisiana cotton-chopper, Serena Williams, her sinewy
shoulders bare, and the glitzy son of an Iranian immigrant, Andre
Agassi, champions at the US Open.
</P>
<P>
   Blanche and Reggie received silver cups for their amateur
efforts. Playing limited, sunshine schedules, only outdoors, they
seldom left England. Williams and Agassi's Flushing Meadow cups ran
over with gold, $750,000 apiece. Jets and dollars have made the
world their 12-month playground.
</P>
<P>
   Launched within an affluent social stratum, tennis had trickled
in all directions, carried by a procession of determined, sometimes
flamboyant champions like Suzanne Lenglen, Bill Tilden, Jean
Borotra, Alice Marble, Bobby Riggs, Pancho Gonzalez, Billie Jean
King, Rosie Casals, Ilie Nastase, John McEnroe, Yannick Noah, Jimmy
Connors, and now Agassi and the Sisters Sledgehammer, Serena and
Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Although every sport has metamorphosed over the last 100 years,
perhaps none, other than soccer and boxing, has spread so
universally and astoundingly. Especially since the ``open''
Revolution of '68 that transformed and professionalized an
essentially sheltered, amateur tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   Pros have existed almost since the beginning, in the early days
primarily as instructors. When some of them gathered for the
European Pro Championships of 1923, their cups seemed tin. First
prize (the only prize) was $120, going to a Limey with a heart of
gold: J.C.S. Rendall. In one-for-all spirit, he cut it up into
equal shares of $13.50 with fellow competitors.
</P>
<P>
   At the declaration of integration of pros and amateurs, merely a
handful of pros operated during that 1968 campaign when about
$400,000 was available for 12 opens. But their names glittered:
all-timers Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Pancho Gonzalez, King, and
Casals among them. Everybody's in business now, grasping at stakes
of well over $150 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 20th century only the dimensions of the court remained
unchanged. Money, television, airplanes, agents, advanced training
and coaching programs, boot camps for children (aka tennis
academies) and, of course, souped-up high-tech rackets have made
today's game radically different from the wood-age reigns of
Tilden, Lenglen, and Helen Wills Moody. The 1990s supremacy of the
latest all-timers, Pete Sampras, winner of $38,808,561 in prize
money alone, and Steffi Graf, $21,839,777, has made them seem
supercharged creatures from another solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Now, power of stroke and mobility through time zones are the
guiding principles, allowing the athlete _ a one-person band _ to
survive not only competition on court but a planetary agenda,
balancing personal demands and goals with the proprietary claims of
homeland for Davis and Federation Cup duty.
</P>
<P>
   Life was more leisurely, say, in 1938 when Don Budge carved out
the original Grand Slam by grabbing the four majors (Australian,
French, Wimbledon, US) inside that year. Three weeks by boat took
him Down Under, almost a week to Europe. Other travel was by train
or car. Budge's itinerary covered eight tournaments of which he won
six, plus a successful defense of the Davis Cup. Sampras would kill
for that kind of relaxed schedule, with virtually the entire winter
off. Tilden, whose record of six straight years at No. 1 (1920-25)
was tied by Sampras in 1998, hid out at an indoor court in
Providence, R.I. during the winter of 1919-20, fine-tuning his
backhand. A guy who had been ranked No. 70 in the US only three
years before, he emerged like Superman from a phone booth to take
over the world at age 27.
</P>
<P>
   Tilden had every shot, to go along with an outspoken, imperious
presence, and continued on the struggling pro tour into his 50s.
You can find geezers who swear nobody could touch Big Bill now or
ever. To me, great players of one era would be great in another,
adjusting to the equipment and conditions, and surely Tilden and
Budge were two of the century's greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly exceptional players abound more densely today.
Professionalism demands it. But if lefties Laver and Martina
Navratilova, twinkling for two decades _ my ultimate champs of this
fading century _ were to surface in the next, in their prime, I
wouldn't worry about their safety. Laver, with an unapproachable
two Grand Slams (1962, 69), and Navratilova, with 167 singles, 162
doubles titles, would get up to present-day speed fast because they
were swift and fit, fortified by complete games, combativeness, and
smarts.
</P>
<P>
   These are my upper crust (dauntless baker's dozens) for the 20th
century, Navratilova and Laver at No. 1 followed by the rest,
chronologically:
</P>
<P>
   Men _ Laver, Tilden, Fred Perry, Jack Kramer, Gonzalez,
Rosewall, Roy Emerson, Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe,
Ivan Lendl, Agassi, Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Women _ Navratilova, Lenglen, Wills Moody, Alice Marble, Pauline
Betz, Maureen Connolly, Althea Gibson, King, Margaret Court, Chris
Evert, Steffi Graf, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   Let the arguments and debates begin and go on forever. Check
back in 2099, and we'll select the 21st centurions.
</P>
<P>
   For thoroughgoing solidity, give me Emerson and McEnroe,
Navratilova and King because they were doubles geniuses, too, who
could have won alongside Red Auerbach (the statue or himself).
   To play for my life in a must match, I'd take Gonzalez and
Evert.
</P>
<P>
   The most influential players:
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Davis, the Harvard kid who launched the Davis Cup,
captaining the winning US team in 1900 . . . Chic Mlle. Lenglen in
abbreviated frocks liberated the women from corsets and petticoats,
lured record crowds to Wimbledon where she was unbeaten (sparking
construction of the present Wimbledon in 1922), and headed the
pioneering pro troupe in 1926 . . . Entrepreneurial Kramer,
champion-promoter, kept the pro tour going until open era, set up
the men's circuit that became the ATP Tour, was the name on the
most popular racket . . . Gibson, 23, leaped from Harlem over the
color barrier at the 1950 US Championships, knocking out
segregation that had held her and others back. Despite that late
start in the big-time, she won US and Wimbledon titles in 1957-58 .
. . Arthur Ashe, the calm champion-statesman instrumental in
forming the ATP in 1973, whose distinguished presence and counsel
is sorely missed . . . King, a founder of the WTA in 1973 whose
inspirational playing and evangelical preaching on behalf of female
pros lifted the entire game _ fortunately she remains an inspirer.
</P>
<P>
   Most influential non-players:
</P>
<P>
   Administrators Herman David, Britain, and Bob Kelleher, US,
steering open tennis into being in 1968 . . . Jimmy Van Alen, who
founded the Hall of Fame in 1954, and invented the tie-breaker in
1965 . . . Gladys Heldman, brains behind the organization of the
women's breakaway to their own pro tour in 1970-71 . . . Howard
Head, who started the out-of-control racket technology explosion
with the odd-looking (then) oversized metal models in his name
during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Who can name the prime matches? Too many of them, although Steve
Flink tries compellingly in his new book, ``Greatest Tennis Matches
of the 20th Century.''
</P>
<P>
   The most written about: Budge's rebounding Davis Cup victory at
neutral Wimbledon in 1937 over German Gottfried von Cramm (6-8,
5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 8-6) from 1-4 in the fifth. (That completed a 3-2 US
victory, assuring the Yanks of the Cup for the first time in a
decade.) Lenglen's 6-3, 8-6, win over Moody, in the Cannes (France)
final in 1926, the lone meeting of the goddesses, attracting the
game's first world-wide press coverage.
</P>
<P>
   No, I wasn't there. But here are a half-dozen shotmaking feasts
that I covered, yet clinging in my neural mush:
</P>
<P>
   Rosewall over Laver, 4-6, 6-0, 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 7-6 (7-5), WCT
final, 1972, a thriller to the wire . . . King over Evonne
Goolagong, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, US Open final, 1974, both attackers had
the crown enthralled . . . Borg over McEnroe, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-7
(16-18), 8-6, Wimbledon final, 1980, a smorgasbord of
Sunday-punching, Mac dodging five match points in the tense breaker
. . . Seles over Graf, 6-2, 3-6, 10-8, French final, 1992, fiercely
contested . . . Graf over Sanchez Vicario, 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 10-8,
French final, 1996, both at their best, Graf refusing to wilt when
Sanchez Vicario served for it . . . Jim Courier, US, over Greg
Rusedski, Britain, 6-4, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 1-6, 8-6, excruciating all
the way, deciding the 3-2 Davis Cup joust at Birmingham, England,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   And here's one I still don't believe: Chanda Rubin, climbing
from the deepest pit (0-5, 0-40, third set) to cancel nine match
points and beat Jana Novotna, 7-6 (10-8), 4-6, 8-6, at the French,
1995.

 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The season started at 4:30 a.m. the day after
Thanksgiving with shoppers lining up outside of Toys ``R'' Us in
Atlanta to buy coveted Pokemon cards _ and it built from there.
Yahoo, the leading Internet portal, recorded more purchases through
its web site in five days this month than during its entire 1998
holiday season. In Manhattan, the Gap ran out of $175 leather pants
so fast that the sight of shoppers breaking into tears of
frustration became common.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium may turn out to be a bust, but by any measure
Christmas 1999 was swinging.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers will not officially report their December sales until
early January, and many of the biggest shopping days are still to
come with post-Christmas sales. But already, retail analysts are
saying the nation's largest stores are on track to see a
year-over-year rise in purchasing well in excess of 6 percent,
making this the strongest Christmas since 1994. Some merchants are
even whispering about a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   The International Council of Shopping Centers, which tracks
actual purchases in small stores in a cross-section of malls, was
showing a 6.6 percent rise in sales through last weekend. And, said
the group's president, John Konarski, ``we might possibly see it go
up to 8 or 9 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Telecheck Services Inc., which tracks check writing at a broad
swath of the nation's retailers, seconded the assessment. ``We are
looking at close to an 8 percent gain for retail sales for the
month of December,'' said William Ford, a Telecheck official. ``It
is an amazing season for the retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   A copious holiday season makes a fitting, if not unexpected,
climax to a year where Americans _ encouraged by a soaring stock
market and rising wages _ have indulged in a sustained shopping
spree. And in keeping with their fattened wallets, shoppers showed
a lust for the finer things in life _ though not necessarily at any
cost. If the holiday had any theme it was luxury at all price
points.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was packaged as gauze-thin v-necks by the discounters
or as a $375 hand-woven Pashmina muffler in wildberry (think deep
pink) at Saks Fifth Avenue, customers could not get enough
cashmere. ``I am getting cashmere for my mother, my sister and my
housekeeper,'' said Catherine Russell, an actress in Manhattan who
started her holiday shopping just last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of jewelry, a category whose performance is tied directly
to the state of the economy, were up 10 percent, according to the
shopping center group's surveys. Zales Inc. reported a tremendous
interest in relatively affordable solo diamond pendants; at Neiman
Marcus, the upscale department store, sales of much more expensive
baubles, like ruby and emerald bracelets, were ``outstanding,''
according to Karen Katz, executive vice president of stores.
</P>
<P>
   While luxury was the watchword, discounters hardly ceded their
role as the 800-pound reindeer of the shopping season. Wal-Mart,
the nation's largest retailer, said it was going to meet
expectations of sales growth of 5 to 7 percent, as consumers
thronged it stores to buy everything from Thunder Punch Buzz, an
action figure from Disney's ``Toy Story 2'' movie, to flat-screen
televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics retailers also fared very well as Americans clamored
for the latest digital cameras, DVD players, and personal digital
assistants. According to the shopping centers council, the
electronics category had the single biggest increase in sales, up
14.6 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with recent trends, department stores, as a group,
were not faring as well as the rest of the retailing pack. The week
before Christmas, many resorted to deep price cutting to meet sales
expectations. Dillard's, in the most dramatic example of the
phenomenon, was offering ``after Christmas prices'' of up to 50
percent off many items.
</P>
<P>
   The result may be that while the department stores will post
solid sales numbers, their margins could be thin _ a possibility
that Wall Street is watching carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of retailers are giving it away this season,'' said John
Morris, a retail stock analyst at Gerard Klauer &AMP; Mattison.
</P>
<P>
   There was another casualty in this unusually flush season:
customer service. Data from the Labor Department indicates that
retailers did not substantially increase their staffs for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retail employment numbers are down a little on a seasonal
adjusted basis, which is remarkable really,'' said Carl Steidtman,
chief retail economist with Pricewaterhouse Coopers. Steidtman
speculated that a tight labor pool and automated check-out
technologies were partly to blame.

   Whatever the reason for their absence, human helpers were sorely
missed. ``This was by far the biggest Christmas for complaining
about sales help,'' said Britt Beemer, chairman of America's
Research Group, which conducts annual holiday surveys among
shoppers. ``Some 33.8 percent of shoppers felt stores were too
short-handed, which was nine points higher than last year, which
was already an all-time high.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet merchants benefited from the public perception that
brick-and mortar stores are a hassle _ and from heavy spending on
advertising. Visa International, which accounts for about half of
the nation's credit card spending, estimated that online purchases
roughly tripled from November and December of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Christmas of different proportions than last year,''
said Kenneth Seiff, chief executive of Bluefly.com, on online store
featuring cut-rate designer fashions. ``Instead of being a novelty,
people were here to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Seiff estimated that his company did more business in its two
peak days, Dec. 13-14, than it did in the entire fourth quarter of
last year. Items popular offline were in demand online as well.
``We re-ordered pashmina four times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its geometric and well-touted growth, Internet sales
still only accounted for about $3 billion, or less than 2 percent,
of what the National Retail Federation estimates was $186 billion
in total holiday retail sales of general merchandise, apparel and
furnishings. That meant plenty of people were sticking loyally to
their local mall, despite the inconvenience of crowded parking lots
and absentee sales associates.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara and Larry Hudgins of Athens, Ga., shopped for their five
children and six grandchildren at Rich's, a regional department
store chain owned by Federated Department Stores. Although Mrs.
Hudgins said she had had trouble finding a sales clerk to help her
in the children's department, her husband, who owns an electrical
contracting company, said he would not consider switching to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right at the present time, I don't trust it,'' he said. ``I
don't trust anybody who wants my credit card and who I can't see.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there were last-minute shoppers who just did not trust
web merchants to deliver on time. John Suh, a lawyer doing last
minute shopping Thursday in Manhattan's Herald Square, said that he
had heard mixed stories about the Internet and just wanted to
``have my gifts in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Manhattan, the nation's shopping capital, a
holiday-swelled tourist population helped keep stores churning. At
the new Banana Republic store at Rockefeller Center, Monica
Karalis, a concierge fluent in five languages, had her mouth full
flipping back and forth from Spanish to Italian to French as she
helped customers track down items like pony-skin belts.
</P>
<P>
   While apparel with ``Y2K'' and ``Year 2000'' logos racked up
disappointing sales nationwide, merchants in New York said the
market for themed plates and stuffed animals was brisk enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that anything that had `New York' on it and the year
2000 in combination was instantly gone,'' said Joe Denofrio, a
spokesman for Macy's Herald Square. Other hot sellers at the store
included Champagne flutes with 2000 embedded in their stems ($19.99
a pair) and musical snowglobes of Times Square playing ``Auld Lang
Syne'' ($35).
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the non-New York customer buying,'' Denofrio said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DARIEN, Conn. _ The meteorologists may say that there hasn't
been any snow this winter in this quaint, affluent town. But don't
tell that to Henry and Doris Herbert's 11 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Come Christmas morning, they will discover up to 6 feet of snow
blanketing their grandparents' two-acre property here, giving them
the perfect place to test out the sleds and toboggans they will
receive as presents on Saturday. What's more, the six boys and five
girls will discover that they will be the only ones for miles and
miles with a patch of winter in a landscape of green and brown _
offering irrevocable proof, no doubt, that this year, Santa decided
that no one was more special.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Santa, they might want to give thanks to Snowman
Services of Darien for the reminder that in the go-go '90s, you
don't have to dream about a white Christmas, you can just order a
man-made, made-to-order version if you're looking for the ultimate
Christmas-morning indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   For a minimum of $750, Snowman Services can manufacture snow to
be dumped in backyards, front yards, parking lots or country
estates, using a quieter version of the snowmaking equipment used
by ski resorts. And in a booming economy, the prospect of summoning
winter with a simple phone call, take-out style, has been quite the
fashionable gift or gesture this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have got into a bidding war,'' said Jonathan
Sweeney, Snowman's owner, who controlled the Herbert family
snowstorm Friday afternoon. ``One guy from Scarsdale said, `I'll
pay you $5,000 if you do us and blow the other people off
tonight.''' (Sweeney declined the offer, saying that his policy was
``first come first serve.'')
</P>
<P>
   Creating snow, or faux snow, is not new, of course: Ski resorts
do it, on a huge scale. Movie studios in California do it, for
special effects. Even malls in Florida occasionally do it, for
promotional purposes, by chopping up ice to get _ voila! _
something that feels like snow.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of creating snow for purely personal reasons _ so
that one family can have it, while everyone else does not _ has
caught on in only the last year or so. Sweeney, for one, takes
orders for snow-filled birthday parties, corporate events and
Christmas surprises throughout Fairfield County.
</P>
<P>
   In Manchester, N.H., Kendall and Colette Veilleuxbegan a
snow-making business this year, after stumbling upon Sweeney's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   And in Midland, Mich., SMI Snowmakers, one of the country's
leading manufacturers of snow-making equipment for ski resorts,
occasionally accepts orders for private parties, usually from the
rich and famous (an example: Celine Dion), at a cost of $3,000 to
$10,000, said Joe VanderKelen, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Snowmaking can be a finicky business. The temperature, for one
thing, cannot exceed 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Snowmaking requires a
lot of water, too, about 20,000 to 100,000 gallons per night. And
the customer is usually expected to supply the water, whether from
a swimming pool, a sewer or a pond.
</P>
<P>
   So to get, say, an acre of man-made snow, one-foot deep,
requires about 27,000 gallons of water, or a little less than a
swimming pool, which can be accomplished in six to eight hours,
Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   To do it right, Sweeney said, you would also need to spend about
$75,000 in start-up capital to procure a snow-making machine, which
resembles a wayward jet engine; a generator; a trailer; cables;
hoses, and a pressure booster.
</P>
<P>
   And for the prospective client, of course, there is the cost,
which is just a euphemism for sticker shock: $750 per night, per
machine, in Sweeney's case. But here in Fairfield County, one of
the wealthiest places in the country, cost is usually an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney first got the idea in 1995, when one of the clients (a
well-known Wall Street financier) of his full-time landscaping
business, Darien Tree &AMP; Lawn Care, asked if man-made snow would be
possible for a holiday party.
</P>
<P>
   Though that project never came about, Sweeney eventually bought
some equipment and tested it at his own house for a couple of
years, overcoming problems like excessive noise and more technical
matters. Then, in 1997, he tackled his first job: a children's
party for a prominent doctor in Westport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a huge sperm whale that landed in their
driveway,'' said Sweeney, 36, about that project, which measured 8
feet tall, 25 feet wide and 100 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, people started noticing Sweeney's creations popping up all
over Fairfield County. And this year, Sweeney began advertising on
WKHL, an oldies station in Norwalk, Conn., and on the Internet, at
www.snowmanusa.com or www.darien-lawn-tree.com.
</P>
<P>
   It has grown so frenzied, he said, that he has had to hire extra
people in recent days to work three round-the-clock shifts to match
demand, and turn down numerous requests because of scheduling
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas H. Fingelly Real Estate Inc. was one of the groups that
made the cut. On Thursday afternoon, the company celebrated a very
good year with a blanket of man-made snow surrounding its new
office in Westport, topped by Christmas caroling and the occasional
snowball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people dream of a white Christmas,'' said an ebullient
Victoria Fingelly, a co-owner who was bedecked in a black mink coat
dotted with fake snow. ``We make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has had the same reaction, naturally, to the sight
of uneven snowfall. A few bah-humbugs say that the practice could
engender neighborhood envy; others say that it's just another
convenience for the well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   But here, in Darien, Henry and Doris Herbert's five children
decided that they could think of no better gift _ or surprise _ for
the 11 grandchildren, whose ages range from 2 months to 16 years,
than to pull a fast one on Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it has been a few years since there was any snow on
Christmas Day, said Lauren Banerjee, one of four Herbert daughters.
And by splitting the $750 cost, the gift would actually be cheaper
than a trip to, say, Radio City _ plus, the snow will last for
perhaps a month.
</P>
<P>
   There was a close call on Thursday night, however. When Mrs.
Banerjee's 4-year-old nephew, Jack Fisher, talked about the weather
on Friday, he calmly told his mom, Bebe Fisher, ``There will be
snow tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Nervous, Mrs. Fisher asked Jack why. Did he know? Had someone
slipped and let the secret out?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the boy, who has never experienced a white Christmas
before, simply smiled and said, ``Because it's Christmas.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ At first glance, it seems that this city's
business establishment prefers its Indians from New Delhi rather
than from Dakota Tipi, a village 50 miles down the Trans-Canada
Highway.
</P>
<P>
   In Winnipeg, the city with the Canada's largest unemployed
aboriginal population, business leaders have begun a campaign to
triple the number of immigrants lured annually to this heartland
city nearly at the country's geographic center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor is our No. 1 constraint,'' said Bob Silver, owner of
Western Glove Works Ltd. Among the 1,000 people sewing jeans at his
factory here are workers from India, Laos, the Philippines,
Ukraine, Vietnam and Yugoslavia, along with a few aboriginal
Canadians. Unable to find more workers, Silver has set up shops in
China and Mexico, as well as Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   But while business owners complain of a labor shortage,
aboriginal unemployment rates stubbornly hover around 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why go abroad when we have so many resources right here?''
asked Sean Kocsis, a Mohawk who directs the Aboriginal Business
Development Center here. ``We have a pool of individuals right here
that could be tapped but are underutilized.''
</P>
<P>
   Manitoba's employment problem is a Canadian echo of a familiar
paradox in the Great Plains of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Much as the American plains states constitute a low-unemployment
belt, Canada's Prairie Provinces _ Alberta, Manitoba and
Saskatchewan _ have this country's lowest jobless rates, about 5.5
percent compared with a national average of 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Manitoba and Alberta recorded Canada's highest
rates of economic growth last year, around 3.3 percent. Although
still a Canadian granary, Manitoba now exports more manufactured
goods than agricultural products, shipping books, buses, furniture
and airplane parts to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortage of qualified labor in Manitoba has been the fastest
growing issue among our members,'' said Dan Kelly, local vice
president for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. ``In
Manitoba business owners are getting quite desperate to attract
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But just the way Bismarck, N.D., records virtually no
unemployment while nearby Indian reservations suffer double-digit
jobless rates, there are two different societies in Manitoba, a
province of 1.1 million people scattered over an area larger than
France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of 500 aboriginal adults we tested, 200 came out at grade five
level,'' said Marileen McCormick, executive director of the Center
for Aboriginal Human Resource Development, this city's largest job
placement center for indigenous people. In Winnipeg dropout rates
of aboriginal high school students are double those of the rest of
the population. Half of the aboriginal households with children are
headed by single mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The waves of Indians migrating here from distant reservations
often arrive with little conventional work experience, said Ms.
McCormick, who is Metis. Accounting for about 20 percent of
Canada's aboriginal population and concentrated in the Prairie
Provinces, Metis are descendants of plains Indians and European
trappers and traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get people coming from generations of welfare,'' she said.
``When anything happens in the family, in the community, they just
go.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Canada, a largely urbanized country, could largely
ignore the rural reality of Indian Canada, throwing money at an
invisible problem and hoping for gradual improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But now demographics and migration are forcing the issue. Since
1980, Canada's birthrate has dropped by one quarter. Now it is
heading below the replacement level.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, indigenous Canada is enjoying a population
explosion. With birthrates rising, half of Canadian aboriginal
people _ North American Indians, Metis and the Inuit, or Eskimo,
inhabitants of the far north _ are under 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is probably no single more important issue for the
economic future of the Prairies, particularly Manitoba and
Saskatchewan, than the advancement of its aboriginal human
resources,'' concluded a recent study by the Caledon Institute of
Social Policy, a private research center based in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   The demographic shift is striking in Winnipeg, a virtual
city-state, which encloses 60 percent of Manitoba's population
within its beltway.
</P>
<P>
   Within 15 years aboriginal people are expected to account for as
much as a quarter of the working-age population. At the same time,
retirement looms for waves of plumbers, welders, electricians and
carpenters _ skilled tradesmen whose average age here is 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is education,'' said James Carr, president of the
Business Council of Manitoba, a private group that seeks to draw
aboriginal workers into Manitoba's economic mainstream. ``The
number of aboriginals entering and completing high school is
doubling, tripling, quadrupling _ the same for our community
colleges.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a mentoring program, 10 Business Council member companies
have established close relationship with aboriginal companies, a
program that Carr plans to expand soon to all 50 member companies.
In addition the council is promoting aboriginal hiring policies and
spotlighting aboriginal ``role models,'' or success stories.
</P>
<P>
   As these and other efforts start to take effect, the face of
Winnipeg, a white-bread city that once fancied itself as ``the
Chicago of the North,'' is gradually changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started here, in 1982, aboriginal people didn't work in
banks, in stores,'' Ms. McCormick recalled. ``You could count the
number of aboriginal apprentices on the fingers of one hand. Now we
are placing 1,200 people a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting growing consumer clout, advertisements in Manitoba's
two new aboriginal monthly newspapers, Grassroots News and The
Drum, included the following phrases recently: ``aboriginal-owned
and -operated,'' ``Ray Scaife, your First Nations automobile sales
consultant'' and Richard Harris, ``your aboriginal tire expert.''
</P>
<P>
   Winnipeg's mayor, Glen Murray, is pushing to expand the number
of aboriginal officers on the city police force.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of aboriginals' growing political clout here, Ms.
McCormick's employment center and a host of other native groups now
occupy a grand building downtown that once was the passenger
terminal for the Canadian Pacific Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   The center is the keystone for a multimillion-dollar aboriginal
development that is to include a park, a sweat lodge, a roundhouse,
a market, an art gallery, a youth center and the headquarters of
the provincial Metis federation.
</P>
<P>
   With such activity going on, some aboriginal leaders do not see
a threat in the business community's goal of bringing in 8,000
immigrants a year. Although the basement of the old railroad
terminal still contains quarantine holding cells for just-arrived
immigrants, no one at the Indian Center upstairs talks of putting
them back into use.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada we are such a massive country with such a small
population,'' said Mary Richard, a Metis, who directs the
aboriginal urban renewal program from the old rail terminal. ``I
don't see immigration as interfering with what our community is
working on.''

DEPARTING CHIEF SAYS KODAK IS NOW BETTER FOCUSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Maybe George M.C. Fisher should feel pretty
glum right about now.
</P>
<P>
   This is the man, after all, who in 1993 was hailed as the
Eastman Kodak Co.'s shining star. Fresh from a successful stint as
Motorola's chief, he was expected to steer Kodak from the
frightened old-style photography company it had become into a
robust, hugely profitable player in the digital imaging age.
</P>
<P>
   Those first few years, it seemed all systems were go. Fisher was
an absolute hero in Rochester, a city whose economic fortunes and
self-image have long been tied to Kodak. Strangers would greet him
in restaurants and markets, the local news media recorded his every
move, and the national press _ along with numerous consultants and
professors _ placed him with John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric
and Lawrence A. Bossidy of AlliedSignal among the premier
management movers of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher never fulfilled that promise at Kodak. When Daniel A.
Carp, a 29-year Kodak employee who has long been Fisher's heir
apparent, officially accepts the chief executive's post on Jan. 1 _
a year before Fisher's contract officially runs out on Dec. 31,
2000 _ he will inherit a company that measures the performance of
its digital portfolio in reduced losses, not stellar profits.
</P>
<P>
   Its mainstay business, conventional photography, is under
competitive siege from Fuji Photo Film of Japan. And even though
the Japanese yen has risen in value, making Kodak more competitive
against Fuji, the continued strength of the dollar against most
other currencies keeps eating away at its overseas profits.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Kodak's share price is mired; its stock topped $80
a couple of times during Fisher's tenure, but always dropped
precipitously again. Kodak shares closed at $63.4375 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When Kodak announced the succession in June, many analysts
speculated that Fisher had been pushed by a fed-up board to
relinquish the helm earlier than he had planned. Fisher, who is 60,
insists the succession plan is on schedule, and any suggestion
otherwise is enough to send sparks flying from his generally calm
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed longer than I intended to, and I really get angry at
innuendos that the board booted me out, or that Dan staged a palace
coup,'' said Fisher, who will remain Kodak's chairman until the end
of 2000. ``I should be getting high marks for managing a succession
plan that was smooth as ice, yet everyone is looking for subplots.
The fact is, some board members just didn't want me to leave,
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a recent conversation in his Rochester offices, as a
bright winter sun bathed his face _ ``I'm a child of the sun, I'll
take the window side in a plane just to enjoy the glare,'' he said
with a laugh _ Fisher seemed anything but shaken or contrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never believed the hype about me going in, and I don't
believe the bad things people say now,'' he said. ``I never
deserved to be put on a pedestal, but I also didn't deserve to be
knocked off it so inappropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   As Fisher tells it, when he was persuaded by Roberto C.
Goizueta, then chief executive of Coca-Cola and a Kodak board
member, to take Kodak's top job in 1993, the company was a mess.
</P>
<P>
   It was mired in debt. It had haphazardly diversified into
pharmaceuticals and other areas it knew little about. Its growth,
save the revenues it added on with ill-starred acquisitions, was
flat. It was a high-cost manufacturer, with a bloated staff and a
sleepy culture that was slow to make decisions. And it regarded
digital photography as the enemy, an evil juggernaut that would
kill the chemical-based film and paper business that had fueled
Kodak's sales and profits for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great American icon that was going the wrong way,
fast,'' Fisher said. ``Roberto said, `You've got to do this for God
and America, you've got to get it directed into the next century,
to make Kodak's own people understand that this company has a
future.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher believes he has done just that. He notes that today,
Kodak is focused on pictures, nothing else. It is nearly 20,00 jobs
lighter, and a lot nimbler, thanks in part to a set of
culture-changing incentives that reward managers for fast decisions
and even faster execution. Roughly a third of its senior managers
are new in their jobs; the board includes many more outsiders. And
the company has a huge presence in China and other emerging
markets, where most experts think consumer use of cameras is poised
to explode.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this year, Kodak started growing again, with sales up
about 5 percent. Its per-share earnings are rising, while its debt
is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak also has a new ``digitization strategy'' for using digital
technology to enhance, not replace, conventional film. Through
Internet partnerships that let customers receive electronic
versions of their photos by e-mail, through kiosks that let them
manipulate and reproduce old photographs, and through archival
services that let users store their photographs on CD-ROMs or on
the Internet, Kodak has managed not only to salvage its profitable
chemical-based photography business, it has added a technological
veneer to it.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fisher is ready to say goodbye. He has already sold his
Rochester home, a 15-room house on 15 acres that Fisher, an avid
horticulturist, said has the most beautiful trees of any place he
has lived in. He and his wife, Ann, will move into a small
apartment after the sale closes in March, but come 2001, it will be
goodbye to Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I feel sad, I loved that house, and I'll miss many Kodak
people, but I always knew I'd leave town when the job at Kodak was
over,'' Fisher said. ``It would have been too difficult to stay on
after being head of Kodak, you become such an icon.''

<P>
   Following are other excerpts from a nearly three-hour
reminiscence session:
</P>
<P>
   Q. There are those who view your tenure at Kodak as a terrible
disappointment. Do you feel you've failed?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not at all. I remember telling Roberto it would take three
years to get Kodak on track. He said it would take five, and OK,
it's taken closer to seven. But the fact is, I've accomplished
everything I set out to do. I get angry when I get mail from people
complaining about my performance, or when members of the press
select the quotes they use to paint negative stories. We're going
to have the best financial year in the history of the company, and
a lot of analysts do have buy ratings on Kodak stock these days.
</P>
<P>
   I got Kodak pointed in the right direction, and if the new team
gets all the credit for that, well, Godspeed to them. Smart people
will recognize that I laid the fundamentals. When you write the
history of these last six years, you'll find that one of my
greatest contributions was changing the culture here.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But it was supposed to be turning Kodak into a digital-profit
machine.
</P>
<P>
   A. In 1993 no one, not even Bill Gates, understood the impact of
the Internet. Still, if you'd asked me then how big Kodak's digital
business would be by now, I'd have said two, maybe $3 billion.
Well, it's $2.3 billion this year. Maybe my real failure is that I
haven't communicated how powerful our digitization strategy really
is.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But you are losing $100 million a year in digital, and
shareholders are clearly unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   A. You call it losses, I call it investment. If this were a
stand-alone start-up company, I'd be a hero on Wall Street. I'm
growing the business 40 percent a year, and if I were losing $100
million as a start-up, investors would say `big deal.'
</P>
<P>
   There are 117 dot-com companies out there who keep saying
they'll eat Kodak and Fuji up. It amazes me how many smart people
believe such stupid statements. I wish I could get investors to sit
down and ask good questions, but some people are just too stupid.
</P>
<P>
   I remember a time when Motorola's stock was down, and Bob
Galvin, the chairman, asked me three things. Will I sell my
Motorola stock? I said no, of course not. Am I doing the right
things? I said yes. Am I doing the right things in the right way? I
said yes again. He said, the stock price will take care of itself.
It did there, and it will here.
</P>
<P>
   Q. As you look back over the last six years, are there memories
that make you wince?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nineteen ninety-seven was my year from hell. Everything went
wrong. We lost the World Trade Organization decision; the currency
went south; the health organizations got aggressive in purchasing
medical films; our CD-ROM prices collapsed; our leading film
competitor got aggressive in pricing. Even our race car started
losing all its races! There were days I wondered whether there was
some gravitational field from the outer universe impinging on us. I
never doubted myself, but there were times I wondered if I could
handle one more piece of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   I had no choice but to promise we'd take $1 billion out of
costs. And that meant cutting jobs. I'm a nice person, a good
person; I don't like hurting people. I'd spent my first few years
traveling all around Kodak, and I knew these people personally.
These were people who really trusted me, put their faith in me.
Cutting all those jobs, all at once and in such a harsh way, was
one of the most painful things I've done in my life.
</P>
<P>
   Q. More painful than knowing that many people think that you,
too, were thrown out of your job against your will?
</P>
<P>
   A. The main problem seems to be the perception of the press. The
press doesn't understand how companies run. And yes, I was really
caught off guard, and very hurt, by the negative perceptions that
came out in so many articles when the succession was announced. I'm
always surprised by the underlining meanness, about the selectivity
of the quotes, about how the media will latch onto the neatest
sound bite. In hindsight I guess I was naive. But I have the
confidence of my brain, of knowing I can think and move in real
time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are you going to do now?
</P>
<P>
   A. I get called quite frequently from high-tech start-ups
looking for a chief. And I've sent signals out that I'd like to do
some teaching, so the calls are starting to come in from
universities. Right now I have the notion that I'd like to teach
technology in an engineering school, although I may come to my
senses before I take that plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Q. None of those jobs are likely to yield the celebrity status
you've enjoyed in Rochester. Will you miss the attention, and the
perks and prestige of being a corporate chief?
</P>
<P>
   A. Being Kodak's CEO in Rochester is an unreal existence. In
Chicago, when I ran Motorola, I could be hit by a truck and no one
would notice. Here, if I sneeze, it's written about. It's not
always an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   I've never personalized the reasons I was getting in so many
doors; it was the job, not me. If I miss the perks, well, I've been
financially lucky enough so that I can provide them for myself. If
I miss having a corporate plane, I'll buy a plane.
</P>
<P>
   This business about being among the great CEOs of all time,
that's something you folks in the press worry about, not me. My ego
is under control. I don't run my life by what people think about
me. I want people to like me, sure, but I hope over the next 40
years to do many more significant things. And if the press doesn't
recognize those either, so be it.
</P>

METS MANDATE: TRADE NOW. SIGN NOW. WIN NOW.  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steve Phillips was not at his office Friday; at least
he didn't answer the telephone there. His wife, Marni, said he was
not at his office. But when she answered the telephone at their
home in Connecticut, he was not there either.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' general manager was not supposed to be working _ the
Mets' offices, like those of other teams and Major League Baseball
itself, are closed until Jan. 3 _ but maybe if he made just one
more call at the right time Friday, he could have found another
general manager in the mood to make a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips loves to make trades. As long as they improve his team,
of course. He has been making trades to improve his team for 19
months now, since the Mets acquired Mike Piazza in May 1998. He has
had an impressive run.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has a mandate, not to mention a difficult task. It is
his job to pull the Mets up to the level of the other team in town.
The other team has won the last two World Series and three of the
last four. That is some task.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what the flurry of activity was all about last
winter, and it is the reason for this winter's activity. The Mets
had conceded the city to the Yankees long enough, and the Mets'
owners did not like their position. Whether they could ever out
slug George Steinbrenner in a checkbook battle for New York's heart
and soul is debatable, but they at least wanted to be in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Winning is expensive. In his 27 years as the principal owner of
the Yankees, Steinbrenner has spent more money than any other
owner. Sometimes he has spent it wisely and productively; other
times he has squandered it on players who were the baseball version
of fool's gold. With the Yankees' revenue sources, however,
Steinbrenner could afford to make mistakes, then spend to try to
correct them.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday have not always been willing to
spend on Steinbrenner's level. But in an era in which teams
apparently have to be among the biggest spenders to have a chance
to reach the playoffs every season, they know they have to raise
their ante.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition of Mike Hampton and Derek Bell, the Mets
have raised their payroll to $75 million for the 17 players they
have signed. That amount already exceeds their 1999 payroll of
$71.3 million for 33 players, including 8 on the disabled list when
payrolls were computed.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have 13 players signed for next season. Those
players have a total salary of $52 million. Only a few weeks ago,
after the Yankees signed David Cone for $12 million, speculation
spread that the Yankees were heading for the first $100 million
payroll in baseball history. They will fall well short, even after
Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera collect whatever they want in salary
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees trimmed more than $6 million from their payroll by
trading Hideki Irabu and Chad Curtis. Who would have thought
Steinbrenner would be in the business of downsizing a payroll?
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets' continues to rise. Phillips has said there is a
magic number beyond which he is not supposed to go, only he will
not say what it is. Competitive reasons, he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, Wilpon and Doubleday have said, ``You just keep
making the team better; we'll tell you if or when you have to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   All general managers would like to have that kind of guideline.
Not all general managers, though, could execute all of the moves
that Phillips has pulled off in the last year or so. Last winter he
added Robin Ventura, Armando Benitez, Rickey Henderson and Roger
Cedeno, retaining Piazza and Al Leiter at the same time. All right,
so he added Bobby Bonilla, too. No general manager is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31 he brought in Darryl Hamilton, who fit quite well in
the Mets' scheme of things. Billy Taylor and Chuck McElroy came
too? See previous paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   This off-season Phillips failed to retain John Olerud, but he
snatched a solid run producer, Todd Zeile, out of the Texas
Rangers' grasp as a substitute. Now he has acquired Hampton, a No.
1 starting pitcher most teams would like to have, maybe even the
Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton does not bring with him a guarantee that he will reprise
his 22-4 performance of last season with Houston, but even if that
should turn out to be his career year, Hampton is at the stage of
his career where he can be a credible No. 1 starter.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mets' No. 1 starter, he can make an impact on the rest of
the rotation. Relieved of the pressure of being No. 1, Al Leiter,
who does not have the stature of Pedro Martinez, could benefit,
becoming more effective and contributing more victories. The
addition of Hampton could have a similar domino effect throughout
the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Some people would not have traded Octavio Dotel, even for
Hampton. Dotel certainly has a future of great promise, but
Hampton, at 27, is only three-years older than the ``youngster''
and has already been a major league starter for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Mets lose on this trade? Yes, if they don't make the
playoffs next year and they don't retain Hampton beyond next
season. If they should win the World Series and Hampton still
leaves as a free agent, no problem. He undoubtedly would have
served his purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Teams at the level at which the Mets want to remain do not deal
in futures. They trade and sign free agents to win now. Phillips,
even if he takes a few days off in the next week, has learned that
role and practiced it well. The Hampton trade should be no
different. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: TIMELY GIFT IS BESTOWED ON NEW YORK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Fla.)  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No one should come to New York to live unless he is willing to
be lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   _E.B. White &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two months after the loss to Atlanta in a
spine-tingling playoff series, Mets fans have gained a star
pitcher. Mike Hampton, one of the three best pitchers in baseball
in 1999, is a Met. The Mets acquired the 22-game winner from the
Houston Astros on Thursday along with outfielder Derek Bell.
</P>
<P>
   To get Hampton, the Mets gave up rich young blood: outfielder
Roger Cedeno, the rookie right-hander Octavio Dotel and the minor
league left-hander Kyle Kessel. Within the last two weeks, the Mets
also acquired the free agent Todd Zeile to replace John Olerud at
first base.
</P>
<P>
   The clock is now ticking. Can Hampton pitch the Mets to a World
Series? Can the Mets entice Hampton, who is from Brooksville, Fla.,
to stay in New York?
</P>
<P>
   For Zeile, New York was the attraction. ``I always felt Texas
was the safe choice,'' he said. ``In my heart, I kept coming back
to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   E.B. White, in his classic 1948 essay ``Here is New York,''
describes three New Yorks: The city of those who were born here;
the city of the daily commuter and finally the city of those who
were born somewhere else and came to New York seeking fame and
fortune. Since then, a fourth New York has emerged: the New York ofthe mercenary free agent ballplayer who gambles on playing in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The free agent athletes gamble that they will perform
successfully onstage, convincingly manipulate the news media and
catapult their careers, stature and pocketbooks before being
consumed. The championship series with Atlanta last October gave
clear and hopeful signs that the Mets are one behind-kicking
superstar from the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Mistakenly, I thought the missing player was Seattle's Ken
Griffey Jr. Who wouldn't welcome the challenge of coming to New
York, leading the Mets to the long-awaited Promised Land? Well,
Junior, for one.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that New York is too dense for Griffey; he wants more
elbow room, not less. He is also too secure with his place in
baseball history to volunteer for a rat race that he cannot win. He
does not need the aggravation of journalists who often take
themselves too seriously and frequently put themselves above the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Randolph, the Yankees' third base coach and their
longtime second baseman, who was born in New York, has seen careers
flourish and go to ashes in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have total belief in your ability to play, if you
can't face the media and handle the media, you can't survive,'' he
said. ``You have to stay focused on winning, not just your own
stats. That's hard, because if you're a big free agent, more than
likely you've signed a big contract and you feel that you have to
meet expectations. If you let that get in the way, you're in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens took an entire season to settle into a New York
Yankee state of mind, to realize that the Yankees were great before
he arrived, that he did not have to pitch a no-hitter every time
out for the team to win. All he had to do was play a role.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph also said that in two seasons, the wear and tear of New
York pressure has shown on Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piazza is a great player,'' Randolph said, ``but it looks like
he feels the pressure of being `the man.' He doesn't look like he's
enjoying himself maybe the way he should.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Piazza recruited Zeile, volunteered to call
Griffey and is so pleased to see Hampton. Hampton, at least, is in
the driver's seat. I'm a little more concerned about Zeile, the
former Ranger who chose the challenge of New York over the comfort
of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While Hampton provides a missing presence, Zeile is replacing a
very popular player. Does the West Coast Zeile have the mettle to
contend with slumps when they come, to live with the fact that he
is not John Olerud?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're different players,'' Zeile said. ``He's a great first
baseman, but I'm not coming here to be John Olerud. I'm my own
player.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be a pressurized season of high expectations. Steve
Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said the acquisition of
Hampton ``catapults us beyond the team that won 97 games last
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The substitutions of Bell and Zeile for Cedeno and Olerud
represent an increase in strikeouts from 166 to 223 and a decrease
of 50 stolen bases. More home runs, less speed, lower on-base
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Mets get a great pitcher in Hampton and a hopeful
first baseman in Zeile. At least for now, there is happiness on the
Mets' side of New York. &QL;

`ENTHRALLED' POPE OPENS DOOR TO A MILLENNIUM HOLY YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHRISTMAS-BETHLEHEM) 
(lh) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ In a moment he has been waiting for his entire
pontificate, John Paul II opened wide the Holy Door to Saint
Peter's basilica Friday evening, ushering in a holy year that is
supposed to set the tone for the entire third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this hour, the word `today' rings out with a unique
sound,'' the pope said in his midnight mass homily. ``It is not
only the commemoration of the birth of the Redeemer, it is the
solemn beginning of the Great Jubilee.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five minutes before midnight, following a 500-year-old
ritual, the 79-year-old Roman Catholic leader, at first unsteady
and supported by two aides, used both hands to push open bronze
doors that are kept bricked up until a Jubilee, a holy year,
begins. Then, assisted by the two aides, he sank to his knees in
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Eve is one of the most sacred days on the Roman
Catholic calendar, but this year's is laden with unparalleled
significance, marking the opening of the Holy Year of the new
millennium, and, in the minds of many, the 2,000th anniversary of
the birth of Jesus. (If, as according to traditional belief, Jesus
was born in 1 A.D., then the actual 2,000th anniversary would be in
2001.)
</P>
<P>
   It is also a deeply personal triumph for John Paul II, whose
failing health has at times put his ability to manage a holy year
into question. ``It is difficult not to be overcome by the
eloquence of this event,'' the pope said in his homily, his voice
steady and clear. ``We remain enthralled.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after his surprise election in 1978, as the first
non-Italian pope in more than four centuries, Cardinal Stefan
Wyszynski, a fellow Pole, whispered to him, ``If God has chosen
you, he has chosen you to lead the church into the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II signaled the occasion's importance in his first
encyclical in 1979. Since then, he has repeatedly instructed his
followers to use the coming year to conduct a thorough examination
of conscience, seeking pardon for personal failings and also for
Roman Catholic errors throughout the entire history of the Church.
</P>
<P>
   With as many as 20 million pilgrims expected to visit Rome this
year, the 2000 Jubilee is the largest ever held by the Vatican, and
the first that marks the turn of a millennium. Modern technology,
from live television and Internet coverage to Vatican-issued
pilgrim cards equipped with microchips that can be used to book
religious services, tour buses and restaurants, has made it the
most widely accessible. Fifty-eight countries, including Cuba,
requested a link to broadcast Friday night's event live, for an
estimated audience of 1 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, 8,200 people were squeezed inside St. Peter's,
which usually holds 7,000, and which was outfitted with television
monitors. Outside, in St. Peter's Square, 40,000 invited guests
were seated, craning for a glimpse of the pope on four giant TV
screens.
</P>
<P>
   And tens of thousands of others, hailing from all over the
world, stood crammed around the life-size creche and a 78-foot
Christmas tree on the square. As the doors opened, a symbol of the
threshold to salvation, the crowd applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 2,000 years we relive this mystery as a unique and
unrepeatable event,'' the frail pontiff said at the main altar of
the basilica. ``This is the truth which on this night the Church
wants to pass on to the third millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the Holy Door is the main symbol of a Jubilee,
the Catholic term derived from the Hebrew word ``yobel,'' a law
handed down by Moses requiring that slaves be freed and debts
forgiven every 50 years. Because each pope wanted a chance to
preside over a Holy Year, starting in 1475 they were scheduled to
occur every 25 years.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The first Jubilee was held in 1300 by Pope Boniface VIII, who
summoned religious pilgrims to Rome when the crusades made travel
to the Holy Land too perilous. (Rome, however, also proved to carry
risks: in 1450, masses of pilgrims leaving a papal blessing mobbed
the only bridge over the Tiber, and 200 people drowned.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very particular event, and for me, an important
moment,'' Nicola Passariello, 31, an Italian business consultant
based in Paris said, explaining why he had stood in St. Peters
square for hours in the cold. ``I hope that this will be a sign of
a different, better millennium: more humane.''
</P>
<P>
   To mark the special quality of this Jubilee, John Paul II
decided to be the first pope in history to personally open the holy
doors of all four main basilicas in Rome. This Christmas evening,
for example, he is expected to drive across Rome to open the holy
door of St. John the Lateran, which was the church of the popes
before St. Peter's was built and is now the see of the bishop of
Rome, an office the pope also occupies.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1300, believers have made the pilgrimage to Rome to seek
an indulgence, a remittance of punishment for sins. For the year
2000, the pope has broadened the paths to an indulgence, which he
views not as a fast-track to heaven, but as a way of deepening
Christian commitment. Traditionally, pilgrims were required to
visit the main basilicas of Rome. This year, they can also visit
Jerusalem, their local diocese, or even the Rome airport chapel.
They can do penance with simple acts such as visiting a prison
inmate or refraining from smoking for a day.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Friday night's holy door ceremony was carefully reworked to fuse
medieval customs with innovations intended to signal Catholicism's
relevance in a modern, multicultural world. Accompanied by Eastern
music, Asian women in native costume placed garlands of flowers on
the jamb of the door immediately after the pope opened it. As he
sat on a throne in front of Michelangelo's Pieta, African musicians
in tribal robes sounded horns made of elephant tusks.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican broke with other traditions, including the ritual of
the pope using a medieval gilded silver hammer to knock down the
brick wall that conceals the Holy Door until a Jubilee begins. On
Christmas Eve 1974, cement fragments went flying dangerously close
to the head of Pope Paul VI, injecting a frisson of panic in what
was supposed to be a serene and solemn moment. From then on, the
Vatican decreed that the brick wall should be torn down a few days
early.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, John Paul II struck the hammer three times as a symbol
before he open the Holy Door for the extraordinary jubilee he
proclaimed to mark 1950 years since the death of Jesus,
traditionally held to have been in AD 33.
</P>
<P>
   After that, however, the Vatican decided to do away with a
practise seen as obsolete and unnecessarily taxing for the aging
pope.
</P>
<P>
   The police swarmed the area, aided by Jubilee volunteers, and,
as for every event on St. Peter's square, visitors were screened
with handheld metal detectors.

   boasts no grandiose new edifice for 2000 along the lines of
the Millennium Dome in London. The Italian government took a more
conservative approach, choosing to spend most of the $950 million
allocated for the capital to restore and clean churches, palaces
and historic areas rather than to erect monuments to this epoch.
New amenities are few and subtle, like an underpass alongside the
Tiber river to ease traffic near St. Peter's.
</P>
<P>
   The Church, however, has already completed 18 of the 50 new
churches it plans to build in the new millennium in the modern
suburbs of Rome, a sign of high optimism in an era when church
attendance continues to decline. And, disregarding the warnings of
some outside archaeologists, the Vatican also dug up ancient parts
of its own territory to build a six-story underground garage to
accommodate 115 buses and 800 cars for pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, millennium thrill-seekers mingled with the
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rome is the center of the world right now,'' said Avi
Perciger, 47, an Israeli tourist who brought his 15-year-old
daughter Noam on a bat mitzvah tour to St. Peter's Square. ``We are
on the way to Times Square for the millennium New Year, and this is
the appropriate station on the way.''

LONGHORNS LINEMAN GIVES NEW MEANING TO GARGANTUAN

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ As the youngest sibling in a large family, the
Christmas holidays provided some magical moments for Leonard Davis
during his formative years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until third or fourth grade, all of my brothers and sisters
were still buying toys for me,'' Davis said. ``I'd clean up every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   With 21 siblings stuffing packages beneath the Christmas tree,
tales of Davis' holiday hauls became legendary to envious youths in
Wortham, a farming community roughly 90 miles southeast of Fort
Worth. Like stories about Davis himself, they border on the
Bunyanesque but can be verified by those who have watched the
6-foot-6, 360-pounder develop into the player Texas coach Mack
Brown calls ``our most dominant offensive lineman.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a junior left tackle, figures to be the only player
suited up in the Jan. 1 Cotton Bowl game vs. Arkansas who:
</P>
<P>
   Grew up sharing a bunk bed with a nephew five years older than
he.
</P>
<P>
   Learned to drive a tractor as a 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Served as a 300-pound water boy in the seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   Forced a submission from teammate Casey Hampton, a fellow
300-pounder, in an all-you-can-eat challenge involving platters of
chicken wings in the campus dining hall.
</P>
<P>
   Learned the art of patience during holiday meals with 50
relatives in a house with one kitchen and one bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, there is little understated about the Longhorn who
answers to the nickname ``Big.''
</P>
<P>
   No second word necessary. Just ``Big.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been Davis' handle since the fifth grade, when he topped
6 feet and 200 pounds. It took on additional meaning in the seventh
grade, when Wortham High School's 6-4, 300-pound water boy towered
over every player on the varsity roster.
</P>
<P>
   It fits nicely in describing Davis family gatherings, like the
one scheduled to unfold this weekend at the home of Leonard's
parents, L.A. and Sammie Davis. The couple married in 1977, after
each went through the death of a spouse.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. entered the marriage with nine sons and two daughters.
Sammie had six daughters and four sons. A year later, Leonard
became the only child produced from the marriage of Sammie and L.A.
Davis. He was 10 years younger than his next-closest sibling, 27
years younger than his brother, Charlie, a standout defensive
tackle at TCU (1971-73) who played 10 seasons of professional
football in the NFL and USFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always telling him, `I've got rings older than you,'''
Charlie Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   But none would fit on Leonard's fingers.
</P>
<P>
   In a family of large men _ L.A. (6-1, 195) is small by Davis
standards _ Leonard clearly stands out. Lamonte Chambers, the
nephew who shared a bedroom with Leonard when both were growing up
in Wortham, recalled the day he learned that lesson. Chambers, 26,
played running back at Tarleton State and is five years older than
Leonard Davis, 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked on him a lot when we were kids, but he got too big,''
said Chambers, a junior high football coach in Mineral Wells. ``It
was my freshman year in college, and I was home for the weekend. I
jumped on his back to knock him down, like I'd always done, but he
continued to walk around the room. He just laughed at me and kept
walking.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Davis was 14. He still laughs a lot, especially
when asked how he keeps track of important dates in family history.
</P>
<P>
   Because of all the older siblings, Davis said he has so many
nieces and nephews that he ``can't even count them.''
</P>
<P>
   How does he track all the birthdays?
</P>
<P>
   ``I depend on Mom and Dad,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Dad is 76. Mom is 63. Together, they will be hosts to a
Christmas gathering this weekend for more than 30 family members
(down from previous years), including Leonard. All who attend
consider it an annual highlight. But there will be logistical
challenges in the three-bedroom house, Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cars are parked all over the place, and the bathroom doesn't
get any rest,'' Chambers said. ``People are always coming up and
asking, `Which child are you?' We should wear name tags.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Davis likened the buffet-style family feast to a major
sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to do something, there's always a line,'' Charlie
Davis said. ``Everywhere you turn, there's a crowd. I couldn't
imagine getting ready for school if we'd all been in the same house
at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither could his youngest brother. Fortunately, that was never
an issue. When Leonard Davis was born, he was one of eight children
living in the house. By the time he was old enough to attend
school, it had thinned out to four. By the time he was 9, Davis and
Chambers _ the only remaining school-age children _ were assigned
their own bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   At that juncture, Leonard Davis had yet to distinguish himself
as a football player. But he turned some heads by plowing fields as
a 3-year-old while his father tended to the cows on the family
farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could go a couple of hours at a time by himself, driving a
tractor, at 3 years old,'' said Chambers, who watched from atop
another tractor in an adjacent field. ``My grandfather always kept
an eye on him, but Leonard literally plowed the fields. He was
always well-advanced for his age. His size and his mind grew pretty
well at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, his size and skill have earned Davis a spot on the All-B]
ig 12 team. As the Longhorns' left tackle, he protects the blind
side of quarterback Major Applewhite. Offensive coordinator Greg
Davis pinpointed the junior's return to the lineup after missing
four games with a sprained ankle as the start of major strides in
an offense that averaged 410.1 yards and 34.2 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leonard has come 100 miles this year,'' Greg Davis said.
``He's not the finished product. But he's got great feet and upper
body strength. The sky's the limit on what he could do. If you went
to draw the prototype offensive tackle, you'd draw Leonard Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Leonard Davis has the physical tools. He bench
presses more than 500 pounds. He wears a size 56-long sportscoat.
His pants require a 48-inch waist with a 34-inch inseam. Coaches
praise his work ethic, which he attributes to Chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been more of a mentor to me than anybody else,'' Davis
said. ``He taught me a lot about the mental aspects of the game,
about being tough and being a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't teach him anything about being ``Big.''
</P>
<P>
   For Leonard Davis, that comes naturally. Both on and off the
field.

<P>
   For as many Christmases past as Kellen Sampson can remember, he
has been jostled, wrestled about and had to contend with bigger
kids to play with his own toys.
</P>
<P>
   And he has loved every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad's players coming over to our house on Christmas has
become a tradition,'' the 14-year-old son of Oklahoma basketball
coach Kelvin Sampson said. ``It's special. Especially \Rwith\S the
players who can't go home. It's been fun because they're all kids
in a way. They've become a part of our Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Christmas is a time for sharing, and many college basketball
coaches choose to share time with their players during what can be
a difficult time for young athletes spending the holidays away from
home. Some coaches invite their team over on Christmas Day or have
a party or take time to have a special dinner if the team is on a
road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Some mark the holidays with special observances, doing for
others.
</P>
<P>
   At Kansas, each of Roy Williams' players shop for gifts with
donated funds for a designated family and arrange a time to
personally deliver them. The Oklahoma women's team recently took
the ``Little Sooners'' to see ``Toy Story 2'', and will participate
in the local Meals on Wheels program on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And today, as usual, will be open house at the Sampsons' home in
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Sampson hasn't planned a sit-down dinner for the
half-dozen or so players who won't be able to be with their
families on this family day. But there will be plenty of food set
out in the kitchen throughout the afternoon. And perhaps a few
extra pillows scattered about for those guests who customarily fall
asleep on the floor in front of the television, stomachs full, with
thoughts of loved ones separated. And of those around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going over to coach Sampson's house for Christmas is a
beautiful thing,'' former Sooners guard Eric Martin said. ``He has
a beautiful family, and he and his wife treat us like sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important for players who can't go home for Christmas
to have somewhere to go. Spending Christmas \Rwith the Sampsons\S
is something I'll always remember. I'm going to miss it this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who is playing basketball in Argentina, planned to be
home with his immediate family in Kentucky today. But he can
remember the loneliness of the holidays separated from family.
</P>
<P>
   So can Karen and Kelvin.
</P>
<P>
   Karen remembers waking up on Christmas Day, 1980, in a drafty
apartment in Butte, Mont. Kelvin was a young assistant _ soon to be
a head coach _ at Montana Tech. The young married couple was living
in and managing a wooden apartment building leased to the school by
Anaconda Mining Co. for $1 a year, and worth every penny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the second year we were married and we just couldn't go
home \Rto North Carolina\S,'' Karen said. ``The apartments were
just awful. The winds of Montana left sheets of ice on the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember just wanting \RChristmas Day\S to be over with. You
should see the pictures of us on that day. We look pitiful. And
after that, we decided no more Christmases alone. Our house was
going to be open for our players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an 18-year-old daughter \RLauren\S who's never had a
Christmas when there weren't players around, and she's loved it.
One of our greatest joys has been seeing the players come and play
with our kids when they were little. I think that kind of thing was
special to those who had little brothers and sisters they couldn't
be with.''
</P>
<P>
   Other memories are of players helping put together Ninja Turtle
sewers, Barbie's kitchen and other toys that require assembly that
often baffle grownups. Then there was the time at Washington State
(1987-94) when several players dropped by Christmas Eve and Karen
passed out potato peelers and formed a work party to help prepare
the next day's dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a player named Benny Seltzer,'' Karen said. ``He
could really make those peelings fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Sampsons will make sure that each player calls his
family, wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas is a time for celebration of the birth of Christ,''
Sampson said. ``But it's also a time to be with family, to share
memories and warmth. The experience we're going through makes you
realize how important coaches are in the lives of their kids and
how you have to try to make them feel special.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all team gatherings are in Hallmark Card settings. The
Baylor women's team recently had their Christmas party at a
restaurant on a pier overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Santa Monica,
Calif. Because of the team's schedule, coach Sonja Hogg didn't have
the traditional team party at her house before sending the players
home for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you can have your team together for the holidays, it
doesn't matter where you are,'' Hogg said. ``It's always a special
time that you always remember.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the day Rudy Crew arrived in New York City to
take over its troubled yet ever hopeful school system, he was
nothing if not bold. He called on New Yorkers to join him in a
revolution that he likened to the civil rights movement, declaring:
``This is not a faint-hearted exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven by the conviction that all children can learn and that
the adults responsible for them should be held accountable, Crew
galvanized a potent coalition of business, education and
legislative leaders to carry out big reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his boldness and ability to effect structural change _ not
his ultimate accomplishments _ may turn out to be his legacy, after
he was ousted Thursday in a bitter battle with Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. Crew pushed through some sweeping changes in the
organization of the school system, from gutting corrupt and
incompetent community school boards to ending lifetime job
guarantees for principals. But former education officials, union
leaders and education advocates said he never got to the point
where he could work those changes through a huge bureaucracy and
make a difference where it mattered most, to teachers and children
behind closed doors in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set the table,'' said Raymond Domanico, education adviser
to the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, a coalition of civic and
church groups. ``But his team was not strong enough to reach deep
into the school system and make day-to-day changes in the
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   As Crew, the former small-town superintendent from Tacoma,
Wash., bids farewell to four turbulent years in New York, his story
is a paradigm of how difficult it is to make a difference in any
urban school system, let alone New York, with its 1.1 million
children, 1,100 schools, 75,000 teachers and treacherous
intermingling of politics and education. Just surviving four years
was an accomplishment, in a country where the average life span of
an urban superintendent is two and a half years, and a city where
some chancellors have lasted no longer than two.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after settling into his city-owned brownstone, Crew became
caught up in the complexities of moving an unwieldy institutional
bureaucracy, where the attitude of special interests, from unions
to community groups to civil servants, is that chancellors come and
go, but the system remains. Some say he lost his way.
</P>
<P>
   Crew himself struck a philosophical note Friday, as he subtly
sought to take the initiative in defining his legacy. ``History
will have to speak to that,'' he said. ``I had a great time
bringing back the arts and bringing technology into the classroom.
I feel with standardized tests, warts and all, children are leaving
at a higher level, sufficient to walk into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Crew's close alliance with Giuliani, who had
driven out a previous chancellor, gave him the political peace he
needed to move his broad agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he was brought to a halt by the political system, as
he and Giuliani sparred over core issues, like Crew's refusal to
spend tax money to send children to private school. Over the last
six months, as his alliance with Giuliani came apart, he squandered
much of his passion and energy on political rhetoric and power
struggles, losing the connection to parents, children and educators
that he needed to survive and make a difference, education
advocates and union leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, the relationship between Rudy Giuliani and
Rudy Crew was such that you didn't know whose idea was whose,''
Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers,
said Friday. ``His legacy is in some ways the mayor's legacy on
education.''
</P>
<P>
   As his own Board of Education turned against Dr. Crew on
Thursday, refusing to extend his contract by a 4-3 vote, the
protests came mainly from Giuliani's political rivals, like Mark
Green, the city's public advocate, who hopes to succeed the mayor
if he is elected to the U.S. Senate. But there was little outcry
from ordinary people in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``People believed he had the interests of kids at heart,''
Domanico said. ``But I don't think people really knew him. So when
he lost his primary patron, he was kind of cut loose.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carol Gresser, the former president of the Board of Education,
who brought Crew to New York and then had a falling out with him,
said the chancellor was ``terrific in Albany,'' as a lobbyist, but
less visible in the schools. ``It seemed to me that he visited
schools when a photo op was needed,'' Ms. Gresser said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of his own legacy, Crew released a statement after his
ouster saying that he had turned schools in New York into a model
for the nation. He cited his emphasis on literacy and his push for
higher standards. He trumpeted the passage of sweeping state
legislation that gave him more power over the city's 32 community
school boards, recentralizing the system after nearly three decades
of community control. He talked about how he had taken over failing
schools and sent thousands of failing children to summer school,
ending the practice of automatic promotion.
</P>
<P>
   But other educators argued that Crew's accomplishments, while
substantial, were a testament to his political skills, and that his
educational legacy remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   While reading and math scores rose in some years, over the
cumulative four years, they remained relatively stable. On almost
every other statistical measure, including spending per pupil, high
school graduation rates and the percentage of students passing
tough new Regents tests required for high school graduation, New
York City still lags behind the state average.
</P>
<P>
   In the last weeks of his administration, Crew became the target
of the kind of problems he had attacked in the community school
boards, whose powers he successfully cut back. He was unable to
change the public perception of a corrupt school system, symbolized
in the release of two investigations just weeks before his contract
came up for renewal. One found that teachers had cheated on
standardized tests, and the other that high schools had inflated
attendance to gain more state aid. The reports were poorly
documented, and Crew's allies argued that they were politically
motivated; still, the chancellor did not prove strong enough to
weather them without damage to his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Crew took over more than 40 failing schools and ousted
five superintendents, he never convincingly showed that he could do
better than the local officials he had replaced. While scores in
some of the schools improved, in others they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Even Crew's closest allies said sadly Friday that he had never
had the chance _ or perhaps the ability _ to translate his vision
into systemic results. His downfall, one educator said, was that
``he believed too much in the belief theory.''

<P>
   Five men said to be armed with grenades and rifles hijacked an
Indian Airlines passenger plane Friday and claimed to have killed
at least four of the 189 people on board during a forced odyssey
across India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 8 p.m. Friday night, Eastern time, the aircraft
set off once again from a military air base in the United Arab
Emirates for an unknown destination. That flight came nearly 14
hours after the gunmen commandeered the plane and after its third
refueling stop.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 passengers, identified in news reports as some of the
women, children and injured people on board, were released after
the five-hour stopover at the al-Manhad military base outside of
Dubai.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after they were seen leaving the aircraft, the A300 Airbus
took off. Emirates officials, who had allowed the plane to land
after the nearby sultanate of Oman had refused it permission, said
the hijackers had agreed to free some of their hostages once the
plane refueled.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the hijackers, their demands and their intended
destination remained a mystery. At one point in the erratic
journey, they ordered the pilot to fly to Afghanistan but the
ruling Taliban militia refused to allow the plane to land.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from both India and Pakistan said the gunmen spoke
Hindi, the official language of India and the predominant language
in the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was originally bound for New Delhi from the Nepalese
capital of Katmandu.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the emirates said they were trying to negotiate
the release of women and children, but did not intend to try to
hold the aircraft. They said they did not have information about
the condition of the passengers and crew and could not confirm
whether anyone had really been shot on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will allow it to refuel and we will provide it with medical
aid and food if needed,'' Information Minister Abdullah bin Zayed
said. ``That airport is equipped with ambulances. We are not
interested in allowing them to stay for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in India had initially said the hijackers had told a
crew member that they had shot and killed four passengers during
the first forced landing, in Amritsar. The crew member reported the
statement to air-traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   But later, Indian aviation officials said they had been told by
their counterparts in Pakistan that no one had been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines officials said Flight IC 814, which left Katmandu at
4:25 p.m. local time, 5:55 a.m. Eastern time, had a crew of 11 and
178 passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, however, had conflicting reports on passengers'
nationalities. At least 154 were reported to be Indian and 8
Nepalese. Officials told Reuters that other passengers included
four Swiss, four Spaniards, a Japanese, a Canadian and a Belgian.
The nationalities of the other five passengers were not known.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, which is usually a one-hour trip, was seized about
30 minutes after it took off and just as the plane crossed into
Indian airspace.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers, armed with AK-47 rifles and grenades that they
had apparently carried when they boarded in Nepal, first ordered
the pilot fly to Lahore, Pakistan. After Pakistani authorities
denied them permission to land, the plane was allowed to land in
nearby Amritsar, in northwestern India, because it was running low
on fuel, with 20 minutes of flying time remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In Amritsar, the hijackers appeared to panic after having warned
authorities that they would begin killing passengers if anyone
tried to approach the plane except to refuel it. Airport officials
said the gunmen opened fire while the aircraft was on the ground
and then, without waiting for refueling, ordered the pilot to take
off.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said later that the pilot reported to air
controllers that the hijackers had told him that they had killed
four people and had injured several others.
</P>
<P>
   The plane again turned toward Lahore, sinking to an altitude of
just 500 feet before Pakistani officials finally agreed to let it
make an emergency landing on a darkened runway.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan had already sent army commandos to patrol the airport,
although officials tried hard to avoid having anything to do with
the plane. The airport manager, Ghulam Mustafa Mirani, told the
Agence France-Presse that the runway lights had been switched off
to prevent the plane from landing. Only when the plane was
dangerously close to a crash landing, Mirani said, did authorities
relent.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Islamabad said
permission was granted on humanitarian grounds after the pilot
reported that he was almost out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In Lahore, the hijackers demanded fuel and food but apparently
did not speak directly to officials. A spokesman for the
government, General Rashid Qureshi, said the hijackers made their
demands through the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   After 2 1-2 hours in Lahore, the plane again took off without
releasing any people. The gunmen ordered the pilot to fly to
Afghanistan, the authorities said. But it was again denied landing
permission.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan Islamic Press, in a report from the southern Afghan
city of Kandahar monitored by the British broadcasters, said the
civil aviation minister of the Taliban, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor,
refused a request to land at Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known why the Afghans, who have close relations with
Pakistan, refused. In any case, press reports from the region said
the Kabul airport, badly damaged in years of war and civil strife,
does not have operating radar that would assist a pilot in making a
night landing.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts speculated that the hijacking could be linked
to the disputed territory of Kashmir, the object of a long and
bitter struggle between India and Pakistan that heated up into a
military confrontation this year.

   BOULDER, Colo. _ Many Boulder residents remember the place as
the Lucky 7 Motel, a seedy joint on the western edge of town where
hot tubs in each room drew guests in but kept them for only an hour
or so in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As business fell off, the Lucky 7 drained its hot tubs for good
in the late 1980s, but the place did not remain dormant for long.
Using a federal grant, city officials bought it, removed the tubs,
knocked down a few walls and opened the Boulder Shelter for the
Homeless in 1987, with enough space for 68 people.
</P>
<P>
   But even in an upscale, bohemian community like Boulder, where
more than a quarter of the 95,000 residents have advanced degrees
and most voters are that endangered Colorado species, the liberal
Democrat, that was hardly enough. With strict growth limits fueling
a sharp rise in housing prices over the last decade, the number of
homeless people here has been soaring. By recent estimates, as many
as 1,000 people in Boulder County, which has a population of
300,000, need shelter on any given night, twice the number on the
streets just five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, city officials have scrambled to find beds. In
1991, the First Church of the Nazarene made space for about 30
people. But as the congregation grew, creating a demand for more
programs, church officials decided this year to end its outreach to
the homeless, forcing Boulder officials to look elsewhere for
space.
</P>
<P>
   This time they looked inward.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than rely solely on federal and state grants and private
donations to support human services programs, the City Council on
Tuesday voted unanimously to donate space from a municipal building
to accommodate some of the overflow from the old Lucky 7.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next month, the large meeting room in the converted
church that has been headquarters of the Boulder Department of
Parks and Recreation since 1991 will become a sleeping place for as
many as 49 homeless people a night, from October through April.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with homeless advocacy groups say they know of nothing
like this anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's unique,'' said Mary Ann Gibson, executive
director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, a nonprofit
group based in Washington, ``but this is very unusual and
admirable. Most cities don't do anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center
on Homelessness and Poverty, another nonprofit group, said cities
typically used federal and state dollars _ as well as buildings
owned by the federal and state governments _ for homeless programs,
although some cities have pitched in with municipal assets, even if
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where 21,000 people use the shelter system on any
given night, a homeless registration center served as a makeshift
shelter for four years _ but not through any altruism by city
officials. Shelters had grown so crowded that people with nowhere
else to sleep made use of desks and chairs. A judge put an end to
the situation in early January, forcing the city to find more
suitable arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Boulder, city officials encountered little resistance to
addressing the needs of the homeless. Susan Purdy, director of the
Department of Human Services, said meetings with neighbors and with
office workers in the parks building to apprise them of plans for
the meeting room produced expressions of concern but no objections.
</P>
<P>
   When the question of using the building came before the City
Council, all nine members _ seven Democrats and two Republicans _
voted to allocate $27,000 from this year's budget for the project,
most of it to allow the parks department to seal off its offices at
the end of the workday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boulder has a long tradition of protecting the environment and
human services,'' said Will Toor, a councilman. ``We had a need for
a facility, and the building owned by Parks and Recreation needed
only some minor modifications.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boulder initiative comes as the streets are growing ever
more dangerous for homeless people around the country, with no more
gruesome example than Denver, 30 miles to the southeast. In recent
months, the police have found seven homeless men dead, two of them
decapitated.
</P>
<P>
   Robert G. Mann, executive director of the shelter at the old
motel, said Boulder had suffered its share of tragedies, as well.
By his count, 25 homeless people have died in the last five years.
Three drowned, one was choked, one was hit by a car, one committed
suicide and the rest died as a result of alcoholism and
hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are compassionate,'' said Chris Dropinski, the
director of Parks and Recreation. ``We see what's happened in
Denver, but a lot of people here don't understand the magnitude of
the homeless population in Boulder. It's bad. Now, they are gaining
an awareness.''

NEW YEAR'S EVE WILL BE A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL DAY FOR MANY WORKERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Ill., Mass.)   By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ George Fernandes was planning to throw a big party on
New Year's Eve. But then he learned many of his guests could not
come. They had to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple work for utilities,'' he said. ``Some are involved
with computer systems. Some work in hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   The more he thought about it, Fernandes, an electrician foreman
for the city of Cambridge, Mass., decided he should probably be
working too. ``So we canceled,'' he said. ``We're going to have it
the following Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   For many American workers, the dawning of a new millennium is
simply going to mean another day, or night, at the office, as
employers gird for any problems that arise from Year 2000 computer
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Computer systems workers will be at the front lines, making
certain that programs cope with the changeover to 2000. But they
are not the only ones who are going to be on the job.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 832 companies found that some 3.2 million extra
employees would be showing up for work on New Year's Eve, said
Howard Rubin, the head of the computer science department at Hunter
College, who conducted the study for the corporate consulting firm,
Cap Gemini America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be like a Wednesday on New Year's Eve,'' Rubin
said. ``Companies are preparing to deal with any business problems
in a business-as-usual manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides gazing at computer screens, workers will be answering
telephone calls from customers, checking automated teller machines,
inspecting elevators and reading gas and water meters. Someone has
to cook, clean and park cars for all the moonlighting employees.
Police and fire departments in most cities have dispatched extra
workers.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, 37,000 police officers will be on duty Dec. 31 into
New Year's Day. Detectives and others who usually wear plain
clothes will be in uniforms instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expects any problems,'' said Pat Camden, a spokesman
for the Chicago police department. ``But everybody's feels they've
got to be prepared for a worst-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   On most holidays, it's the people at the lower rungs of
companies who tend to draw work duty, but on this New Year's Eve,
the corporate brass is punching the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Some 500,000 upper-management executives are planning to be
working as the millennium dawns, according to Rubin's study. If
anything goes awry, companies will need top decision makers to call
the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Even many chief executives will work, said Steve Vitoff, a
spokesman for Cap Gemini. ``It's as if the top guys are saying, `I
better go down there and do this myself,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lights will be burning late on Wall Street. The big securities
companies have called in thousands of workers to monitor the
computers and answer questions from customers.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Shivers, a managing director in investment banking for
Merrill Lynch, will greet the new millennium in his office at the
World Trade Center. Hopeful that he will not have any catastrophes
to quell, Shivers plans to bring some of his favorite movies to the
office, including ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off.''
</P>
<P>
   The securities industry has also organized a command post on
Water Street, where reports on the status of Year 2000 problems
will be sent to financial companies.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Draper, the spokeswoman for the Securities Industry
Association, said it was vital to keep communication open, so that
``rumors will be squashed before they get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, the discount broker in San Francisco, will
dispatch more than 1,000 extra workers on New Year's Eve, largely
for customer support. Branches will be open on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Harris has been the Year 2000 coordinator for the Wachovia
Bank since 1995, and now eagerly awaits the fruits of her labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``After four years, I really want to be there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies will follow the sun, closely monitoring places
like New Zealand, which sees midnight 16 hours before New York, and
then seeing what happens as the New Year dawns closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's no disaster by the time things wrap around to
western Europe,'' said Rubin, ``some companies may stand down and
send some workers home.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some companies, the alert could mean extra work for
several days after the New Year. Julie Davis, a spokeswoman for
Bank of America in Atlanta, will be traveling to the company's Year
2000 headquarters in North Carolina for the weekend. To be safe,
she has packed enough clothes for a week's stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is the great unknown,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the sacrifice of families on the big night, some
companies have planned a party atmosphere at work and invited
spouses and children to come along.
</P>
<P>
   At its control center in Columbus, Ohio, Bank One will provide
movies for children, popcorn, sandwiches and soda. There will be no
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be kind of coherent,'' said Mike Baldwin, a manager
in the bank's phone division, who will be joined at work by his
wife, Brenda. ``That's all we'd need, if things go wrong, to be
about half crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Althoff, who works for Techsource, a building consultant in
Chicago, said he was delaying telling his wife about working on New
Year's Eve. ``There's no reason to get into an argument ahead of
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the workers expressed confidence that Year 2000
problems pose little threat. But they expect anxious customers to
keep them busy.
</P>
<P>
   Steve George, a manager at GTE Internetworking in Burlington,
Mass., said people were preparing for ``the curiosity factor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients will be wondering, `Is my Web site up? Do I still
have Internet access?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some ordinary problems on New Year's Eve will almost certainly
spark fears of extraordinary trouble. At any given time, about 2
percent of the nation's automated teller machines are out of cash
or paper for receipts, industry experts say. But if that happens to
someone at 12:01 a.m., said Ms. Harris of Wachovia, ``people will
say it's Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Althoff, who works with engineers who check the office
mechanical systems such as water and heating, said some people will
find trouble simply by looking for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to be testing power generators that they
haven't tested in who knows how long,'' he said, ``and some of them
are going to have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who had entertained fanciful notions about
celebrating the millennium, the notion of sitting at a desk on New
Year's Eve does not exactly seem thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Richey, who answers customer service calls for the Public
Service utility in Colorado, said his family had been dreaming for
five years about how to ring in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of drew the short straw,'' said Richey. ``Instead of
being at Disneyland or a tropical island, we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many workers said they expected, and hoped, to be doing little
more than passing time on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes said he would be sitting with his two-way radio at the
Cambridge Electric Light Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be bored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Cushman, who manages an office building in Century City,
Calif., said he usually goes to work in a business suit and tie.
But as he trudges off to his office on this New Year's Eve, he will
be wearing jeans, tennis shoes and a T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to be prepared to throw in myself and do some manual
labor, just in case,'' Cushman said. To be on the safe side, he
said, his building will shut down the elevators at 11:50 p.m. and
keep them idle until 10 minutes after the New Year. He said he was
not taking any chances with somebody getting stuck in an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, Cushman, 36, had wondered, as a child what he
would be doing on the big night that ushered in a new millennium.
``I never anticipated this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Years from now, he said, he expects his children to ask what
marvelous experience he remembers from the dawning of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll have to tell them, `Well, I went to work.'''

WHITE HOUSE TOUGHENS STANCE ON MEDICARE DRUG BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., La., Tenn., Maine, Calif.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Brandishing new data showing that the drug industry
earns higher profits and pays lower taxes than most other
industries, White House officials say that drug companies may bring
price controls on themselves if they continue to resist President
Clinton's plan to have Medicare provide pharmaceutical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has repeatedly said that his proposal for Medicare drug
benefits does not envision federal regulation of drug prices, and
such a measure is highly unlikely. But the statements from the
officials suggest that the White House is taking a harder line as
an election year approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a rising tide politically in this country of strong
antagonism against the pharmaceutical industry on the the dimension
of prices,'' said Daniel N. Mendelson, associate director of the
White House Office of Management and Budget, who is preparing the
budget request that Clinton will send Congress next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal view, and I think the view of some others in the
administration, is that if we don't do something about that now, by
expanding access and availability to insurance, price controls are
an inevitable outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson's comments were made to an audience full of drug
company and health care executives, at a recent conference in
Arlington, Va., where he spoke as an official representative of the
Clinton administration. In interviews this week, other
administration officials said the president deserved credit for
resisting pressure from liberal Democrats in Congress who want to
impose price controls.
</P>
<P>
   Price controls could be imposed only through legislation, and
while some Democrats have expressed an interest in them,
Republicans oppose the idea and many Democrats have little appetite
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, members of Congress and drug companies are preparing
for an election-year battle over prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is possibly the hottest issue up for debate in Congress,
certainly one of the two or three most heated issues,'' said Sen.
Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ``If some cool heads can step in and be practical
here, there's an opportunity for a breakthrough. But the
opportunity will last only a few months. After that, the campaigns
will accelerate, advertising will flow from all directions and
factions will be polarized.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly
and the disabled, generally does not cover drugs outside the
hospital, even though drugs are an essential tool of modern
medicine, used not only to treat but also to prevent many
debilitating illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Clinton unveiled a proposal to offer drug coverage to
all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries. White House officials said
Clinton would resubmit the proposal when he sends his budget
request to Congress next month. But, they said, there will be some
changes:
</P>
<P>
   _ The cost, initially put at $118 billion over 10 years, will be
higher because the use and the price of drugs have been rising
briskly as doctors write more prescriptions and dozens of new
medications win approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton will revise his proposal in an effort to reduce
medical errors, including medication mistakes of the type
highlighted in a recent report from the National Academy of
Sciences. Before dispensing drugs to Medicare beneficiaries,
pharmacists would have to use an online computer system to confirm
that the dosage was appropriate and to check for dangerous
interactions with other drugs the patient might be taking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Administration officials will not insist that drug benefits be
supervised or administered by the agency that runs the rest of the
Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers often criticize the agency, the Health Care Financing
Administration, as heavy-handed and bureaucratic, and Republicans
refuse to give it a larger role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret at this point that there is a very strong
anti-HCFA sentiment on Capitol Hill,'' said Mendelson, the White
House budget official.
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson said that proposals to provide drug coverage to
Medicare beneficiaries through competing private health plans
``deserve full consideration.'' He said the administration was
looking carefully at two such proposals with bipartisan pedigrees.
One was offered by Wyden and Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. The other
was introduced by Sens. John Breaux, D-La., and Bill Frist, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The clamor for Medicare drug benefits has prompted new attention
to the finances of the pharmaceutical industry. The study of drug
company profits and taxes was done by the nonpartisan Congressional
Research Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domestic sales of pharmaceutical products and drug industry
profits rose rapidly'' in recent years, but ``the drug industry's
profits are taxed more lightly than those'' of other major
industries, said the study, requested by Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The study measured the tax burden for each industry by computing
its average effective tax rate, defined as the ratio of its U.S.
income tax liability to its worldwide taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   The effective tax rate was 16 percent for the drug industry, as
against an average of 27 percent for all industries, 23 percent for
manufacturing companies, and 31 percent for wholesale and retail
trade, financial services, insurance and real estate.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the study said, after-tax profits for the
pharmaceutical industry averaged 17 percent of sales, about three
times the average for all industries, which was 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study, based on data from the IRS, did not suggest that drug
companies were improperly evading taxes. Rather, it said, they had
reduced their tax liabilities by claiming a variety of tax credits.
These include a special tax credit for companies with factories in
Puerto Rico; a general tax credit for research expenses; the
foreign tax credit, which prevents double taxation of income earned
abroad, and a special tax credit for developers of drugs to treat
rare diseases, known as orphan drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey L. Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers of America, a trade association, said: ``We have
earned these tax savings because we spend huge sums on research and
development. We are one of the most innovative industries in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, the government would pay half the drug
costs incurred by a Medicare beneficiary, with the maximum federal
payment starting at $1,000 a year and rising gradually to $2,500 in
2008.
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson said the cost of Clinton's proposal was going up
because ``the price and the volume of pharmaceuticals are going
up.''
</P>
<P>
   In re-estimating the cost, federal officials have analyzed data
from other health plans, in the belief that their experience
provides some indication of what Medicare could expect.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Veterans Affairs says its drug spending rose
19 percent, to $1.85 billion, in the fiscal year that ended Sept.
30.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente, one of the nation's largest health
maintenance organizations, with 8.5 million members, says its drug
spending rose 16 percent, to $1.5 billion, in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony A. Barrueta, a lawyer at Kaiser Permanente, said the
increases were larger for certain types of drugs: 17 percent for
antidepressants, 45 percent for antihistamines and 23 percent for
anti-ulcer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's new interest in patient safety follows a recent report
from the National Academy of Sciences, which said that 7,000 people
a year died because of medication errors.
</P>
<P>
   Mendelson said that anyone managing drug benefits for the
elderly should be required to use computer technology to screen
prescriptions and to identify potential problems in drug therapy.
Such ``drug utilization review would be a positive thing for the
health of Medicare beneficiaries because it would reduce drug-drug
interactions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dichter, executive vice president of PCS Health
Systems, a pharmacy benefits manager based in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
said, ``Drug utilization review would be a big advantage for the
elderly, who take so many medications.''
</P>
<P>
   Elderly people take more than one-third of all prescription
drugs sold in the United States. One doctor does not necessarily
know what drugs a patient may have received from other doctors. But
online systems operated by companies like PCS can keep track of all
the prescriptions filled by a patient at drug stores across the
country.

   As it joined the stampede to the Internet in July, the
electronics retailer Circuit City Stores devised a way for its
online customers to avoid a major source of e-commerce anxiety. Any
shopper who fretted over whether an item would arrive on time could
order a gift online and then pick it up at the store.
</P>

   Like a number of other Internet innovations, Circuit City's
``express pickup'' system did not always function perfectly this
holiday season. But it underscored the growing realization in the
retail industry that far from being in conflict with each other,
e-commerce and earthbound retailing can often operate in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   After standing on the sidelines for an agonizingly long time
during the explosive growth of Internet commerce, many traditional
retailers have recently jumped onto the Web with both feet, trying
to capitalize on some of the advantages they enjoy over their
virtual competitors.
</P>
<P>
   National chain stores, after all, do not have to build brand
awareness from scratch with expensive advertising. They already
have thousands of customers. When it comes to returning an item,
they have sensed that most consumers prefer to do it in person, not
through the mail. (Of course, online retailers have advantages of
their own _ for now, at least _ like access to plentiful capital
without having to show earnings.)
</P>
<P>
   As the holidays approached, many traditional retailers began to
see that the Internet could serve as an additional distribution
channel for their merchandise, and stopped worrying about
cannibalizing in-store sales. ``The point is to give your customers
a choice, so they can decide where they want to shop and when they
want to do it,'' said Eileen M. Leary, an analyst for State Street
Research in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, according to Michael E. Hansen, co-chairman of the
e-business practice at the Boston Consulting Group, ``the consumer
wants to shop in both channels, and wants to have a seamless
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing this, some leading retailers, including Home Depot and
Wal-Mart Stores, which is introducing a new Web site, have elected
to move slowly rather than risk disappointing customers with a
premature and poorly designed site.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of traditional retailers that have taken the
plunge is big enough now that analysts are starting to identify
those they believe will be most likely to succeed online.
</P>
<P>
   At or near the top of many lists are chains that came to the
Internet with extensive experience in catalogs and mail order,
which share with Internet retailing the crucial need for reliable
delivery. A widely cited example is Williams-Sonoma, the
kitchenware retailer, which opened its Web site for business Nov. 1
and racked up $1.5 million in Internet sales in its first month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how to get the product to the customer in a timely
fashion,'' said Brian S. Postol, an analyst for A.G. Edwards in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Other retailers used to catalog sales expected to thrive on the
Internet include Staples and Office Depot in stationery and office
supplies, and Victoria's Secret, the lingerie retailer owned by
Intimate Brands. Unlike most retailers, Victoria's Secret does not
offer its Internet customers the option of returning items bought
on the Web site at its stores. But the relative privacy of shopping
on the Web appeals to men who find browsing in a lingerie store
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Among department-store chains, two have taken strikingly
different approaches to the Internet. Federated Department Stores,
parent of Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Stern's and other chains,
signaled a big foray into e-commerce when it acquired Fingerhut,
the catalog company, in February.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said that Fingerhut's expertise in order
fulfillment gives Federated an online edge. But some wondered if
the Internet lends itself to buying sportswear, suits and dresses,
and said that Federated's Web sites so far do not offer enough
depth of selection to sustain customer interest.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Nordstrom, which began as a shoe store, is
emphasizing depth, not breadth, on its new shoes-only site,
www.nordstromshoes.com. The company says that the site lets
customers choose from among 20 million pairs of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The new site, which may be a prototype for other specialized
Nordstrom sites, leaves many analysts skeptical, but Dorothy S.
Lakner, of CIBC World Markets, is optimistic about its prospects.
Since 30 percent of the company's catalog sales come from shoes,
she said, the company ``knew that people would buy shoes without
trying them on.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point to Costco as the general merchandise retailer to
watch on the Web, because of its success in selling merchandise
online that is not carried in its sprawling stores, including items
like jukeboxes, pool tables and even diamond jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Some may find it hard to imagine buying a $70,000 ring online
from a warehouse store, but Costco seems to inspire an unusual
level of trust in customers. ``They are known for having
good-quality items,'' said Michael J. Shea, an analyst at D.A.
Davidson in Great Falls, Mont. ``And you know you're getting the
best deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all analysts say Costco's online product strategy makes
sense. Daniel T. Binder of Brown Brothers Harriman faulted the
company Web site's limited selection. ``The beauty of the
Internet,'' he said, ``is being able to offer a greater breadth of
product, which they don't do.''
</P>
<P>
   But like other retailers, Costco has found that the Internet
presents a low-cost opportunity to promote its products and
establish a bond with customers. The company recently offered a
dozen free eggs in exchange for an e-mail address and received
about two million responses, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, like many ``click-and-mortar'' retailers, Costco's
revenues from the Internet are fairly insignificant: It expects
just $60 million in online sales in the fiscal year ending in
August, a pittance next to overall sales of $27.5 billion. The
portfolio managers who are buying the stock, including Ronald E.
Elijah of the RS Value and Growth Fund, said that the company's
fundamentals are the attraction, not its Internet performance.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors, though, may have doubts about any large
retailer that fails to have an e-commerce strategy, though. ``We
worry about the ones that don't understand it, that are holding
out,'' Elijah said. ``They're going to get challenged.''

CHOOSING A SUCCESSOR FOR CREW WILL NOT BE EASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (With NY-CREW-ASSESS)  
(lh) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With speculation already frenzied about potential
successors to schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, officials at City Hall
said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would urge the Board of Education to
conduct the search on its own, as it did in 1995 in selecting Crew,
rather than by appointing an outside committee or using an
executive headhunting agency.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Giuliani said he believes that returning to the
practice of using a search committee would only add a layer of
bureaucracy to a historically tortured process. But with the
atmosphere surrounding the chancellor search expected to be even
more politically charged than usual, direct action by the
seven-member board would also ensure that the mayor, through his
three allies on the board, has a role from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Friday that they were also focused on the
increasing likelihood that Crew might not finish out the academic
year, either because he was infuriated by the board's 4-3 vote on
Thursday not to renew his contract or because some board members
would prefer he leave immediately. If Crew leaves in the next few
weeks, the board would have to select an interim chancellor before
it could begin looking for a permanent replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Crew, speaking to reporters outside his brownstone in Brooklyn
after returning home from Christmas shopping, said Friday that he
would be willing to stay on until his contract ends in June but
also said it might not be appropriate for him to do so without the
support of the board or City Hall. Asked if he was relieved after
months of uncertainty, Crew said: ``I'm not so much relieved, but
this is the way it ends. God bless everybody. It didn't turn out
that I could do it any longer. I have had a good, long run and I'd
do it all over again, even knowing what I know now.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged off questions about whether the mayor was to blame
for his ouster. ``It's not really a time for pointing fingers,'' he
said. ``That's not where my heart is.''
</P>
<P>
   Board members said they hoped to resolve the question of how
long Crew will remain before their next meeting, which is scheduled
for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine the first we would need to do is decide on an
interim if the chancellor is leaving right away,'' said Terri
Thomson, the board member from Queens who cast the deciding vote
against Crew. ``We'll talk on Tuesday about the process by which we
pick an interim and the process by which we pick a permanent
replacement. The issue at stake is how do we find the best
chancellor that's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, a search to head the school system,
which has about 1.1 million students, is a daunting venture,
complicated by the city's racial and ethnic divisions, the concerns
of parents and the demands of unions. The search in the coming
months will be further entangled by the politics of a busy election
year, particularly the expected Senate contest between Giuliani and
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle facing the board is that even the most informal
suggestion of names is likely to be fraught with political
motivations, a point that Giuliani acknowledged Friday. ``There is
no important job in which lots of names don't get thrown out, some
of which are thrown out just for who knows what purpose,'' Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   Education has already emerged as an issue in the Senate race.
Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said on Thursday that the
mayor should be held responsible for the vote to oust Crew, and he
made it clear Friday that Mrs. Clinton and her Democratic
supporters would be watching the mayor's every move during the
chancellor search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy Giuliani does three things when people disagree with him:
He sues, he tries to fire them or he has them arrested. And you
can't operate that way in the United States Senate,'' Wolfson said.
``Rudy Giuliani will want to install his person as chancellor.'' He
added, ``I think it's imperative that the next chancellor continue
to put New York's children ahead of the mayor's political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   How strong a hand Giuliani looks to have in the search may be
further complicated by his expected run for the Senate and the fact
that regardless of the Senate race, he is barred by term limits
from remaining at City Hall after his second term ends in 2001.
That would mean that any new chancellor would run the schools for
only a year or two before being faced with a new mayor.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Even mayors change,'' Giuliani explained the other day. ``It's
going to happen pretty soon. Change is good. It gives you another
opportunity to reinvent things.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who said he supported the board's decision to end
Crew's tenure, repeated that position Friday. ``I think the system
has an opportunity to go the next level now, which means really
serious thorough reform,'' he said at a holiday charity event.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's desire for the board to conduct a direct search was
met with skepticism by the teachers' union. ``The mayor's
micromanaging the process already,'' said Randi Weingarten, the
president of the United Federation of Teachers. ``I guess the
reason that the mayor wants it that way is he wants to have a hand
in the search.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weingarten said the seven board members should determine how
to conduct the search, keeping in mind some recent educational
initiatives that need to be maintained. Those initiatives, to
improve 40 of the lowest performing schools and to end social
promotion, should be at the top of the board's agenda, she said.
``It's very important that they play a leadership role in calming
the waters.''
</P>
<P>
   While board members said they had not yet discussed specific
candidates, either for an interim or permanent post, people inside
and outside the field of education have already begun tossing
around names, many of people with experience in New York, including
two former chancellors _ Anthony Alvarado and Frank Macchiarola _
as well as the current school superintendents in Dallas, Atlanta
and Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas superintendent, Bill Rojas, worked in the New York
City school system for 23 years, served as superintendent in San
Francisco for seven years and was a top candidate in the last two
chancellor searches in New York. The Atlanta superintendent,
Beverly Hall, headed Newark, N.J.'s schools from 1995 until last
July and previously served as a deputy chancellor for instruction
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Springfield superintendent, Peter Negroni, moved to
Massachusetts in 1989 after serving as superintendent of District
12 in the Bronx. All three of the superintendents are considered
more likely contenders than the two former chancellors. Alvarado,
now working in the San Diego school system, was chancellor from
1983 to 1984 but resigned amid a personal financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Macchiarola, who served the longest tenure as chancellor in
recent history, from 1978 to 1983, is now president of St. Francis
College in Brooklyn, and associates say he is extremely happy in
that job. One City Hall official said that a top aide to the mayor
had suggested Macchiarola as a successor to Crew and that Giuliani
had already rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Crew, in his conversation with reporters, spoke wistfully about
his time as chancellor and hinted that politics was behind his
ouster, before heading off to walk his golden retriever, Chance,
along State Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor and his board members did what they needed to do,''
Crew said. ``I'm not shocked. It's what I anticipated with an
election brewing. It's time to move on. I have had a wonderful
time.''

IT'S GOOD TO HAVE OREL BACK AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is the story I tell when people ask what Orel
Hershiser is really like.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four years ago, I go to an Angels game to write about
Valley-boy pitcher Jack McDowell, who's in town with the Cleveland
Indians. Hershiser is an Indian at the time.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell has a few minutes for an interview in the dugout before
batting practice. We talk about his local connection, his team, his
career, his season. Then he jogs out to shag fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Indians publicist mentions McDowell and his wife expect
a child any day. McDowell will have to fly home right after
tonight's game and probably miss a start.
</P>
<P>
   I've got to ask McDowell about his wife and the baby. But he's
in the outfield. When he comes off the field, he runs straight into
the trainer's room, which is off-limits to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   I wait at his locker. He isn't hurrying back. Meanwhile, I'm
chatting with Hershiser, whom I'd covered in his original Dodgers
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you're going to have to get out of here,'' Hershiser
says, looking at the clock, nearing 45 minutes before game time,
closing time for the writers.
</P>
<P>
   I explain my predicament, how I have one more question for
McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you need to know?'' Hershiser says.
</P>
<P>
   I tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me your tape recorder,'' he says, and he disappears into
the trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Hershiser is back with my tape recorder
</P>
<P>
   containing a quote from McDowell about his growing family.
</P>
<P>
   This small kindness isn't unique in the annals of the
player-writer wars, but it's close.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like the story Jack Disney tells about interviewing
Sandy Koufax for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   This happens in Vero Beach, Fla., one spring in the late '70s.
Koufax, retired and reclusive for a decade, returns to the Dodgers
as a pitching instructor. Disney asks for an interview and Koufax
says yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I borrowed a tape recorder, because it was to be a
question-and-answer format. I didn't own a tape recorder,'' the
writer remembers. ``We went out in a golf cart into the outfield,
way off in the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   For half an hour, Koufax delivers thoughtful answers to Disney's
questions, and the delighted writer thanks the great man for his
time.
</P>
<P>
   Then Disney rewinds the tape, just to make sure he'd got a crisp
recording.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing on it,'' he says. Disney had pushed the
wrong buttons. And he hadn't taken notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feeling of dread engulfed me,'' he says. ``I thought,
`How am I going to explain this to my editor?' I'd just have to
tell the truth I blew the interview because of my mechanical
klutzmanship!
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Koufax said, `Let me see that.' He pushed a couple of
knobs, made sure the recorder was working. He said, `Let's do it
again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat there for another 25 minutes. It wasn't as good as the
first interview, but it was still pretty good. Every time he saw me
after that, he called me Young Tom Edison.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, this isn't a one-of-a-kind memory, but it suggests the
company Hershiser is in among all-time Los Angeles Dodgers good
guys.
</P>
<P>
   In my first season on the Dodgers beat in the mid-'80s, I fly
from Atlanta to Cincinnati with a pair of veteran writers after a
Sunday afternoon game. When we get off the plane, a lone individual
is sitting at the Delta gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garv, what are you doing here?'' one of the veteran writers
exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Garvey, a San Diego Padre now, explains that he'd been
waiting at another gate for his team's flight out of Cincinnati.
He'd started reading the ``Arrivals'' board, saw a flight was
coming in from Atlanta, and was aware the Dodgers had been playing
there.
</P>
<P>
   He says he knew the Dodgers players and other employees would
take a charter flight. But maybe some writers he knows would fly
commercial, and he figures he'll stroll across the terminal and say
hello.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, Koufax, Garvey. Pretty good company, that.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hershiser signed a free-agent contract to return to
the Dodgers after five seasons with the Indians, San Francisco
Giants and New York Mets. Hershiser and Dodgers officials held a
conference-call press conference.
</P>
<P>
   New Dodgers chairman Robert Daly introduced Hershiser as ``the
perfect person to have on the team not only as a pitcher but as a
leader.'' General manager Kevin Malone said Hershiser ``just
commands respect because of who he is and how he goes about his
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But late in the give-and-take, the 41-year-old pitcher sounded
as if he'd heard enough about his sterling character and hoped-for
influence onyoung teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to walk into that locker room,'' Hershiser said
to the writers on the phone, ``and have you guys to make me out to
be a saint. I haven't run my life perfectly and I haven't run my
baseball career perfectly....''
</P>
<P>
   OK, then: Hershiser is not a saint. Neither is Koufax. Neither
is Garvey.
</P>
<P>
   From what I remember, though, he's a heck of a good guy to have
in the clubhouse.

GAY RIGHTS ADVOCATES AIM TO UNDO `DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL' POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ky., Mass.) (kd) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gay rights advocates and their supporters in
Congress are pressing the Clinton administration to combat
harassment against homosexuals in the armed forces while laying the
groundwork to overturn the military's ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy, now enshrined in law.
</P>
<P>
   The conviction of an Army private in the slaying of a gay
soldier at a base in Kentucky, followed by vows from Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to end what they say is a failed
policy, has galvanized opposition to the contentious compromise
that President Clinton and Congress hammered out in 1993. The issue
had largely vanished from public debate until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an opportunity to follow up, there's a focus on this
again,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,, who is one of three
openly gay members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after one of the most painful episodes of the Clinton
presidency, one that brought the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the brink
of revolt and fell far short of Clinton's pledge to allow gays to
serve openly, the president's political heirs are once again
struggling with the issue of gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a dozen aides representing House and Senate Democrats
met with gay rights groups in Frank's Capitol Hill office to talk
strategy. The immediate priority, aides said, is to work on steps
to make military life better for gays, who are allowed to serve as
long as they keep their sexual orientation private.
</P>
<P>
   This week, 15 Democrats, including Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, the House minority leader, and Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts urged Clinton to punish soldiers who harassed service
members perceived to be gay, and to punish commanders who condoned
such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``An indispensable element in the lessening of hostility toward
gays and lesbians in the military is for you to take action against
those responsible for condoning and, in some cases, contributing
to, that climate of hostility,'' the lawmakers said in a Dec. 21
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Frank and other lawmakers are expected to request a
meeting with Defense Secretary William Cohen; the White House chief
of staff, John Podesta; and Clinton's national security adviser,
Sandy Berger, to discuss how the Pentagon can carry out its policy
more effectively. This could mean imposing tighter guidelines on
inquiries into homosexual conduct and barring health-care providers
from turning in gay patients.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Cohen dispatched the Pentagon's inspector
general to major military bases to gauge the harassment problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and gay rights advocates are also likely to pressure
the Army to retain Steve May, a reservist who earlier this year
discussed his homosexuality in a debate in the Arizona Legislature.
May is a conservative Republican member of the Arizona House.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocates intend to make the issue a priority on the
campaign trail, especially in the Democratic primaries in New York
and California, where Gore and his rival for the presidential
nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley, are courting a sizable gay
vote. In September, Bradley said that homosexuals should be allowed
to serve openly in the armed forces. This month, Gore made a
similar public call for the elimination of the current policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term goal of abandoning ``don't ask, don't tell''
faces strong opposition. The Pentagon is against any changes. So
are the Republican presidential candidates and the
Republican-controlled Congress. ``The U.S. armed forces aren't some
social experiment,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican
and Army veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Gore or Bradley is elected and moves to fulfill his
pledge to eliminate ``don't ask, don't tell,'' and Democrats
reclaim one or both chambers of Congress, Capitol Hill will almost
certainly be more conservative than it was in 1993 when a
Democrat-controlled Congress codified the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, gay rights advocates in Congress are divided over
whether to try to legislate changes next year or wait until the
dust settles from the 2000 elections to avoid igniting a
conservative backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said he was ``leaning'' toward
introducing a bill next year to repeal ``don't ask, don't tell. ``I
don't expect a Republican Congress to pass it, but it may serve to
generate debate,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who sponsored a
similar measure in 1993 that the Senate rejected, 63-33, said that
without broader public support and a more Democratic Congress, such
a step could hurt gay service members.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gore nor Bradley has said how he would eliminate the
policy. Gore said he would propose legislation, but he did not
consult his national security advisers before issuing his
one-paragraph promise on Dec. 13, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainty, congressional friends and foes of the
policy are drawing up battle lines, marshaling public opinion polls
that each side claims supports its position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the military to move into the 21st century and
adopt standards based solely on the achievements of the
individual,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore..
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, said most homosexuals should
be permitted to serve openly in the military but added that he
would support ``don't ask, don't tell'' in a handful of elite
combat units where morale and cohesion were essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be realistic about how the military functions,''
Kerry said. ``I'd bow to the rights of a commander to make choices.
When it's life and death, you want to make sure a team has zero
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Democrats like Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri and
John Murtha of Pennsylvania, both influential on military matters,
said they believed the policy was working fine.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have pounced on the issue to illustrate their view
that Democrats are out of touch with mainstream America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings back memories of why the Republicans got the
majority in Congress in the first place,'' said John Feehery, a
spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert: ``To combat the
liberalism of Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Buyer, an Indiana Republican who heads the House
Armed Services personnel subcommittee, sent a memorandum to all
House Republicans on Dec. 16 warning them of the resurgent debate:
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of a homosexual openly serving in the military
was never contemplated by the Congress, and any policy that
suggests that the military should be receptive to the services of
homosexuals is in direct violation of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior military commanders acknowledge that tens of thousands of
homosexuals serve ably but privately in the 1.4 million-member
military. Many officers say the problem is not that homosexuals are
there, but that if they are allowed to serve openly they could
undermine the morale and discipline of fighting units.
</P>
<P>
   A study released this fall by the Triangle Institute for
Security Studies, a university consortium, found that 76 percent of
senior military officers opposed gays openly serving in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of May, the Arizona legislator, military authorities
seem truly torn over whether his remarks are grounds for discharge
under ``don't ask, don't tell.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army Reserve's investigating officer, Maj. Patricia Maddox,
said in her findings earlier this month: ``It appears the immediate
commander has not an option but to recommend initiation of a
separation action to higher headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Maddox urged her command to consider May's
``outstanding military performance,'' his military and civilian
achievements and ``his unlimited potential to be an outstanding
asset as a future officer and a leader in the Army Reserves.''

AT PATAKI'S INSISTENCE, HEALTH PLAN FOR UNINSURED EXCLUDES NEW
IMMIGRANTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  (rk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The landmark agreement reached by Gov. George
Pataki and the Legislature to provide medical coverage for the poor
by raising the state's cigarette tax contains a little-noticed
provision denying those benefits to thousands of legal immigrants
during their first five years in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was included at the insistence of Pataki, a
Republican who has sought to exclude new immigrants from other
forms of public assistance as part of his overall drive to sharply
reduce state spending on a host of programs for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration estimates that it would cost the state
$300 million over the next three years to extend medical coverage
to the roughly 50,000 immigrants who would be excluded from the new
insurance program, a number that is likely to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The provision is drawing strong opposition from advocates for
the poor, as well as the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
of New York, who has sharply disagreed with the governor in the
past over extending public benefits to needy immigrants. The issue
is of critical importance in New York City, where the bulk of the
state's new immigrants live.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides note that federal immigration law makes newcomers
the responsibility of the people who sponsored their entry into the
United States, not New York taxpayers. His aides also contend that
with limited resources available, providing health care coverage to
all legal immigrants would force the state to reduce benefits for
other New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the resources we have available and our desire to
cover as many New Yorkers as possible,'' said Bob Hinckley, a
deputy state health commissioner, ``the plan agreed upon by the
governor and the Legislature was the best way to deal with this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tony Coles, a senior adviser to Giuliani, said the policy
could force New York City to pick up the costs of caring for poor
immigrants who need medical attention, because many will show up at
city hospitals with no way of paying their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Coles said Giuliani would urge state lawmakers to change the
policy, as he has urged them in the past to extend to legal
immigrants other types of benefits, like state-financed welfare
grants. ``The mayor believes that legal immigrants should be
treated the same way as citizens when it comes to important social
services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to provide health care coverage for low-income New
Yorkers was announced earlier this month after weeks of intense
negotiations among the governor and leaders of the
Republican-controlled Senate and Democrat-led Assembly. The measure
was passed by the Assembly earlier this week, but it still must be
adopted by the Senate before being sent to Pataki for his
signature.
</P>
<P>
   The program is intended to provide health coverage for as many
as 1 million uninsured New Yorkers, about a third of the total
number of uninsured in the state. The program is expected to enroll
about 500,000 people over the next 3 1-2 years at a cost of $750
million.
</P>
<P>
   The program would be financed with a 55-cent increase in the
cigarette tax, doubling it to $1.10 per pack, as well as a share of
the $450 million a year that the state is to receive from the
settlement of a lawsuit that states filed against tobacco
companies. The plan would also be paid for with about $300 million
in new federal health care funds.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for providing insurance free to families earning
up to 150 percent of the federal poverty line _ meaning that a
family of four with an annual income of $25,000 or less could
receive coverage without paying premiums. It is modeled after the
Medicaid program, which requires the state to provide coverage
directly to the uninsured by using state funds along with matching
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration contends that the provision barring
recent immigrants from enrolling mirrors a 1996 federal law that
established new eligibility requirements for the nation's poverty
programs. That law bars the use of federal Medicaid dollars for
legal immigrants who arrived after August 1996. The law does,
however, allow these immigrants to collect such benefits once they
become citizens, or after five years, provided that their income,
combined with their sponsors' earnings, does not exceed the federal
poverty line. That limit is $13,000 a year for a family of three.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Pataki, defended the provision.
``It complies with federal law,'' he said. ``Without that, you lose
federal dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for immigrants contend that nothing in the federal
law prohibits New York from using its own money to provide coverage
for immigrants not covered by federal benefit programs _ an option
that the Pataki administration has deemed too costly.
</P>
<P>
   Mark B. Lewis, a lobbyist for the New York Immigration
Coalition, pointed out that 11 other states, including California
and Massachusetts, have used money from their own coffers to extend
medical coverage to new immigrants who are no longer covered under
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the governor's decision means,'' Lewis said, ``is that
immigrants with treatable conditions, such as diabetes or high
blood pressure, will end up in hospitals when their conditions
become emergencies. The real and humane answer is to let immigrants
get health care insurance so that treatable conditions do not
become life-threatening and cost taxpayers thousands of more
dollars to treat.''

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ When the Egyptian government put the national
beer company up for sale a few years ago, nobody was buying.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the brewery had no competition and had been steadily
turning a profit, it was a management nightmare. Workers lounged
around reading newspapers or napping while grimy, ancient machines
gushed foaming beer into dirty green bottles, often along with
insects, twigs and clumps of dirt. Sales were falling. And, as if
all that were not enough of a headache, beer drinking for many
people in Egypt, a predominantly Muslim country, is considered a
sin.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmed Zayat, an Egyptian entrepreneur who had earned degrees
at Harvard and Boston University and flourished at Wall Street
firms specializing in real estate and leveraged buyouts, spotted
potential where others saw only pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years after taking control of Al Ahram Beverages
Co. _ which required some inventive negotiating and a high-flying
stock offering on the London Stock Exchange _ Zayat, 37, has turned
the bedraggled enterprise into one of the best-performing companies
in Egypt. With the help of consultants from Carlsberg, the Danish
brewer, he has begun turning out first-rate beer. Moreover, Al
Ahram has gained enough respectability that early next year it will
also begin producing Carlsberg and Guinness beers.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, he has discovered that the real profit may be in a
line of nonalcoholic beers _ some with apple, lemon and strawberry
flavors _ that have been flying off the shelves. ``It tastes like
beer,'' said Fatenn Mostafa, the director of marketing whom Zayat
hired away from PepsiCo, ``and it's a little naughty.''
</P>
<P>
   While expanding sales across Egypt with a blitz of television
advertising, an army of sales representatives and a fleet of trucks
that provide home delivery _ all new tactics here _ Zayat has begun
exporting nonalcoholic beer to Saudi Arabia and is gearing up to
move into other Middle East, African and Asian countries,
particularly places like Nigeria and Indonesia with big Muslim
populations. Sales revenues jumped 60 percent in the last fiscal
year ended June 30, and profits rose nearly 30 percent, to $26
million.
</P>
<P>
   Zayat's success has been a catalyst for a new wave of investment
in Egypt. The beer company was just one of more than 300
state-owned companies that the government had been hoping to sell
as Egypt took the lead in a shift across the Middle East from
top-down control and state ownership to the more freewheeling style
of capitalism. For most investors and investment bankers, the
universally troubled companies had been a yawn. But when they saw
what Zayat was able to do with Al Ahram, they began searching for
other diamonds in the rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a model for other investors,'' said Josse Dorra
Fiani, the president of Fiani &AMP; Partners, a Cairo consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Before Zayat closed his deal in early 1997, five state-owned
companies had been sold since the privatization push began in the
early 1990s. Now the number is 18, with two state-owned cement
companies bought by corporations in Mexico and Britain in recent
weeks. Government officials say more than a dozen other deals are
in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a different attitude,'' said Mokhtar Khattab, an
undersecretary in the Ministry of Public Enterprise, the
clearinghouse for the sale of state-owned companies. He added,
however, that he thought some of the new enthusiasm was the
cumulative effect of years of government effort.
</P>
<P>
   Zayat, puffing on a Cuban cigar late one evening in his office
at the brewery, said that investors who passed up a chance to buy
the company ``totally misunderstood the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   He managed to take over the brewery for about $70 million, only
about one-third the government's asking price. That so angered some
government officials that they still find it hard to applaud his
achievements. But it demonstrated to investors that Cairo could be
flexible _ something many had doubted. And he has shown the
government that the sale price is only one part of a successful
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Besides helping to attract other investors, Zayat has fulfilled
several other goals of the government's privatization program. He
has begun contributing to Egypt's export earnings and he has
inspired a group of local investors to start a new beer company,
creating competition and new jobs in a country with unemployment of
around 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When a third beer company was about to start up, Zayat, whose
company has an overwhelming share of the domestic market, concluded
that too much competition too soon might not be good. So he bought
out the fledgling company as part of his expansion.
</P>
<P>
   To get started in the wine business, he went back to the
government and bought its small winemaker, taking another company
out of the state's inventory. Zayat, whose company already sells
soft drinks, said he plans to introduce vodka, Scotch and other
hard liquors, aimed at Egypt's tourist trade and its growing
population of affluent, foreign-educated young people.
</P>
<P>
   No one would have predicted such success. There was so little
interest among big investors in Egypt's state-owned companies that
the government sold more than 80 of them piecemeal on the Cairo
stock exchange. Out of frustration, it liquidated nearly 30 other
companies it deemed unsalable.
</P>
<P>
   When no investor was willing to buy the beer company, the
government turned to the local stock market. But the brewery's
reputation was so bad and so many local investors were reluctant to
add a ``sin stock'' to their portfolios that the government cut
back an initial public offering in mid-1996 to 5 percent of the
company, and settled for an offering price of $4.925 a share
adjusted for a recent stock split, rather than a hoped-for $6.25.
It sold two other similarly sized blocks of the company to two big
Egyptian institutional investors and gave another 10 percent to
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The poor reception in the local stock market helped Zayat talk
down the price for the remaining 75 percent. His real estate
experience helped him, too. The government wanted nearly $200
million in exchange for the stake, in part because the main plant,
more than 100 years old and looking like a crusader's castle, sits
on some of Cairo's most valuable real estate, near the center of
town and just across the street from Cairo University.
</P>
<P>
   But Zayat wanted to buy a business, not invest in real estate.
So he proposed that the government keep the land, but lease it to
him for five years. In the meantime, he would build a $50 million
advanced brewery like nothing the Middle East had ever seen, in the
desert on the outskirts of Cairo. He bought the land at below
market price as one of the anchor developers in a new industrial
village the government was starting. As part of the package, Zayat
negotiated a 10-year tax holiday on the new plant.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996, the government finally accepted a bid from
Zayat of $5.51 a share, adjusted for the split, or 11 percent more
than the disappointing offering price on the Cairo exchange. Today
the stock is worth $19.85 a share.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Reaching his goal took 18 months and 22 negotiating sessions.
Zayat's meetings with platoons of government officials often ran
more than 12 hours. ``One time,'' he said, ``I spoke 16 hours and
ended up with everybody in the room asleep but me and the person I
was talking to.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the government said yes there was still a problem:
Zayat did not yet have $70 million. He had to sell the idea of
selling beer to Muslims to international investors. He lined up a
public offering of global depository receipts in Europe and set off
on a road show across Europe and the United States that yielded
Zayat not only enough money to pay the government but even more to
pocket himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the people in the government are still asking, `If he did
it, couldn't we have done it?''' said Daniel Kurtzer, the American
ambassador to Egypt. Zayat paid his bankers and lawyers $10 million
and came away with $25 million in instant profit for himself and a
handful of American backers. And after all the financial wizardry,
Zayat and his backers wound up with a 12 percent stake in the
company.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zayat has taken a creative approach to running his business as
well. He started home delivery because the government limits the
licensing of outlets for beer and because he correctly guessed that
people who might be embarrassed to go into a beer store would be
happy to have a few cases discreetly brought to their door. Stymied
by a government ban on advertising alcoholic drinks, he has
employed a Trojan horse technique, filling the airwaves with spots
for nonalcoholic beer that look very much like beer ads in Europe
and the United States and that have done wonders for both products.
</P>
<P>
   Before the government sale of the brewery, one would-be investor
had estimated that it could be run with a tenth of its 3,200
employees. But with wholesale dismissals forbidden by the
government, Zayat set out instead on a total reorganization. He cut
the production force to about 800 and hired experts from
Carlsberg's consulting unit. He transferred hundreds into the
brewery's new sales force and assigned others to work in warehouses
or as drivers. About 300 people accepted early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He also created a group of inspectors and put them in charge of
quality control. He got rid of a committee system of management,
raised salaries, provided stock bonuses for employees and replaced
the brewery's six-day workweek of six-and-a-half-hour shifts with a
five-day, 8 a.m to 5 p.m. routine. Now, with business booming,
Zayat says, he has more employees than when he started.
</P>
<P>
   Zayat brought the plant into the late 20th century with some
simple equipment that speeded up work enormously. When he arrived
there were four telephones; now there are 1,600. He vastly
increased the number of desktop computers (from four to more than
300) and fax machines (from one to dozens). And he nearly doubled
the delivery fleet to 450 trucks.
</P>
<P>
   To help improve quality control, he installed a simple plastic
sheet to keep dirt and bugs from falling into beer bottles as they
trundled along a conveyor, and he bought an X-ray machine to
examine every filled bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Zayat said he always planned to expand the brewery's product
line. But even he has been bowled over by the nearly 400 percent
increase in the volume of nonalcoholic beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our future,'' said Ms. Mostafa, Zayat's marketing
director.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of the company's profit used to come from
regular beer, she said, but in three years, even with continued
growth in beer sales, the proportion is expected to fall to 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never succeed in getting every Egyptian to drink
beer,'' Ms. Mostafa said. ``It will always be a Muslim country. But
nonalcoholic beer has all the elements to succeed. It's very
healthy. It doesn't have caffeine. It looks like beer. It tastes
like beer. But it's religiously accepted.''

CALIFORNIA TREASURER FAVORS SHEDDING OF TOBACCO STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Mass., Fla., Md., N.Y., Minn., Pa., Mich., Texas)  (lh) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state treasurer of California said Friday that he would
press the state's two big public employees pension funds to sell
off their large holdings of tobacco company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Phil Angelides, said the holdings have lost more
than $500 million in value this year as cigarette makers fended off
lawsuits by the federal and state governments as well as
class-action lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe divestment is a prudent fiduciary course,''
Angelides said, because the financial position of tobacco companies
has been weakened by an ``unprecedented assault by the legal
systems, the regulatory system and, in effect, society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term prospects look dim'' because of these pressures,
he said. Angelides is on the boards of both retirement funds, the
California Public Employees Retirement System, known as CALPERS,
and the State Teachers Retirement System. At last week's market
prices, the funds had about $845 million invested in tobacco
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the treasurer placed a moratorium on the purchase
of tobacco securities by a $33 billion fund that he controls, the
Pooled Money Investment Account, which holds the short-term
investments of the state as well as those of many local
governments. The account had already reduced its holdings of
short-term tobacco securities from a high of $2 billion in the
early 1990s to zero in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Angelides' moves, Philip Morris Cos., the world's
biggest tobacco company, noted that its stock was one of the most
widely held by professional money managers. It added that, ``Public
pension fund managers have a fiduciary responsibility to manage
their portfolios to produce the best financial returns for their
beneficiaries, the public employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said he did
not think that private investors would regard Angelides' action as
noteworthy because the concept of divestment ``has been around for
a long time, and tobacco stock prices are so low, while yields are
substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris shares, which closed at $23.4375 Thursday on the
New York Stock Exchange, have plummeted more than $32 from a year
ago, helping drag down the growth of the Dow Jones industrial
average.
</P>
<P>
   At least six other states have taken steps to restrict tobacco
investments in the last four years, according to Doug Cogan, who
tracks the issue for the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a
nonprofit organization in Washington. State pension fund holdings
have been estimated at about 6 percent of tobacco shares
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Cogan said that Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont had
sold all their holdings. New York and Minnesota, as well as the New
York City retirement fund, have partly restricted purchases. Total
sales in the last three years were about $1.5 billion, he said,
including $825 million by Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A number of universities have also sold off tobacco stocks,
including Harvard, Johns Hopkins, the City University of New York,
Smith, Tufts, Haverford, Wayne State, and public universities in
Texas and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   With about 2.5 billion shares outstanding, Philip Morris has a
market value of about $59 billion, which Cogan said was 75 percent
of the market value of the four biggest cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   Angelides said that the teachers system would consider the issue
at a Jan. 5 meeting of its subcommittee on corporate governance,
which he heads. He said he also discussed the issue last week with
Jim Burton, chief executive of CALPERS.
</P>
<P>
   But Cogan said that officials of the California funds had told
him they were reluctant to set a precedent under which they might
be pressured to sell other types of investments in any future
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of CALPERS could not be reached Friday.

JOAO FIGUEIREDO, GENERAL WHO REVIVED BRAZIL'S DEMOCRACY, DIES AT
81  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Argentina, Paraguay)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gen. Joao Baptista de Figueiredo, who restored democratic
government to Brazil in the face of economic turmoil and sabotage
attempts by hard-line officers and political right-wingers, died
Friday at his house in Rio de Janeiro. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   He had been repeatedly hospitalized in recent years for kidney
disorders and died of a heart attack, local press reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Figueiredo was the last of the military leaders who presided
over the dictatorship that ran Brazil from 1964 to 1985. His
predecessor, Gen. Ernesto Geisel, had begun a gradual relaxation of
military rule, and Figueiredo considered it his mission to complete
the revival of democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the presidency to civilian hands was put to a
final test at the very moment of its fulfillment in March 1985. An
immensely popular president-elect, Tancredo Neves, underwent a
bewildering series of operations and died days before he was to
have taken the oath of office.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilians, who had noisily greeted his election in the streets,
watched with some apprehension as his compromise running mate, Jose
Sarney, was installed. Lacking a mandate, Sarney had to tread
cautiously, whereas Neves had promised vigorous pursuit of overdue
economic initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Sarney soon won a measure of public sympathy as head of an
uneasy coalition between his conservative backers and those of
Neves. He decided to serve out his term as Neves would have, and a
constitutional amendment, sought by Neves and Figueiredo, abolished
the electoral college and restored direct presidential balloting
for the next election, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by confusion, the general left Brasilia, the capital,
for his home in Rio without handing over the sash of office or
attending Sarney's formal inauguration. Figueiredo was reportedly
glad to return to his horses, for which he had a legendary passion,
and to look after his own fitful health.
</P>
<P>
   A cavalryman, he said he preferred the smell of horses to that
of people. Leaving office, the general said, ``I want them to
forget me.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth military president since the armed forces seized power
in 1964, Figueiredo was a former intelligence chief handpicked for
the top job by Geisel. It was Geisel who first moved away from the
harsh military regime that had inflicted prison, torture and exile
in the name of economic and social renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Having put an end to the more egregious violations of human
rights, Geisel left his successor with the task of reviving the
electoral process and coaxing the military back to the barracks.
During Figueiredo's presidency, Latin America's most populous
country took a long stride toward that goal in November 1982, when
Brazilians voted in their first free elections _ local, state and
national _ since the coup.
</P>
<P>
   It was a remarkable event, with a zestful campaign in which
newly resurrected parties vied for ballots. Many of the thousands
of candidates returned from exile only under an amnesty declared by
Figueiredo months after he took office in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt-spoken president, whose job was not on the line,
barnstormed the country like a born politician. His personal appeal
helped the Social Democratic Party to make a respectable showing,
although it lost a number of important governorships and state
houses along with its majority in the lower house of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Figueiredo at first looked like an odd choice for trustee of
Geisel's program of aberatura, Portuguese for ``opening,'' a
deliberate liberalization of military rule and return to civilian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A shadowy figure in uniform and tinted glasses, Figueiredo had
since 1974 headed the deceptively named National Information
Service, the internal security agency deeply implicated in the
ruthless repression not so long before. To those who knew of him,
he was the ``Minister of Silence,'' and he once put off an
interviewer by saying, ``Soldiers are supposed to keep quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1977, his was one of 10 names mentioned as a possible
successor at the end of Geisel's term in 1979, but suddenly, a
publicity blitz started to set him apart from the other generals in
that ``primary,'' most of them austere believers in military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Press reports told of his love of horses. His hobbies and
thoughts on all subjects went public. The assumption at the time
was that associates of Geisel were polishing Figueiredo's image
because the president had decided that he was the most likely man
to carry on with the opening. Geisel, commentators wrote, seemed
determined to achieve what his predecessors had been unable to do _
choose his own successor.
</P>
<P>
   Figueiredo's supporters embarked on an unofficial but highly
active campaign, courting the people as if the decision was theirs.
They kept reminding Brazilians that his late father, Gen. Euclydes
Figueiredo, helped lead an uprising in 1932 against a dictator and
went into exile rather than live in a tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   By January 1978, Geisel was ready to tell the chieftains of the
National Renewal Alliance, the political arm of the military
government, that he wanted Figueiredo to succeed him. The alliance
dutifully endorsed the candidate in April, just days after he had
joined it.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the armed forces then gave their somewhat
grudging consent to the new four-star general. The decision won
formal acceptance by the electoral college, and Figueiredo was
sworn in for his six-year term on March 15, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual restoration of democracy had to overcome a number of
scary moments after that. With the economy turning sour and
inflation worsening, strikes and sporadic urban violence had people
wondering whether the armed forces would step in again.
</P>
<P>
   An outbreak of bombings was blamed on leftists by the military.
But with censorship largely gone, the press unearthed evidence of a
campaign by hard-liners in the military who balked at the ``return
to the barracks,'' even though their commanders publicly supported
it.
</P>
<P>
   Joao Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo was born on Jan. 15, 1918,
in Rio de Janeiro and raised in the southern state of Rio Grande do
Sul. He was 10 when he entered a military school in Porto Allegre.
Figueiredo spent part of his youth in Argentina, where he father
had gone into exile.
</P>
<P>
   Figueiredo was one of the few officers to earn the ``triple
crown,'' a medal for those who finish first in the military
academy, the junior officers' school and the army command and
general staff school. He taught for much of his early career, first
in the cavalry and then in intelligence, and he served with the
Brazilian military mission in Paraguay, the general staff of the
armed forces and the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   He became a colonel just after the 1964 coup and was put in
charge of the National Information Service bureau in Rio.
Figueiredo headed the military police in Sao Paulo before moving to
the staff of Gen. Emilio Medici in Porto Allegre. Medici became
president in 1969 and chose Figueiredo to head his military staff.
It was under Medici that the intelligence agency acquired its
notoriety. Geisel, taking office in 1974, proceeded to relax the
prevailing repression and placed Figueiredo in charge of the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Figueiredo married the former Dulce Maria Guimaraes de Castro in
1942. She survives, as do their two sons, Joao Jr. and Paulo, and
seven grandchildren.

THE RELIGIOUS DIMENSION OF THE MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Religion Column) 
(mk) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let next Saturday belong to the revelers, the entertainers, the
makers of lists. For Christianity, the new millennium begins this
Saturday, Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   Christians should be grateful to the members of other faiths who
have dismissed the millennium celebration as not their party, Jews
for whom this is the 10th month of the year 5760, for instance, or
Buddhists and Hindus who have cited their own significant religious
dates.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these dismissals might have been unnecessarily huffy or
too quick to overlook common ground with those who honor a
different sacred calendar. But they at least had the merit of
recognizing the religious dimension of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Why haven't Christian leaders _ the pope and some minor
preachers of doom excepted _ made more out of that dimension?
</P>
<P>
   Bob Abernethy, the anchor of ``Religion &AMP; Ethics News Weekly,''
a program seen on many PBS stations, raised that question in a
panel discussion on this weekend's show.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Marty, a church historian who was one of the panelists
(this writer was another), suggested that Christians were both
hesitant to appear boastful about the good things in Christianity's
past and reluctant to reflect on the bad things. But mostly, Marty
said, they were overwhelmed, and perhaps frightened, by the
commotion created around a secular pseudo-event.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, as Abernethy noted, has been the exception.
Five years ago, the pope issued a letter, ``Tertio Millennio
Adveniente'' (``The Coming of the Third Millennium''), on preparing
for the jubilee year that he initiated this Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The letter outlined an ambitious plan of preparation and
celebration. The plan included papal journeys to the Middle Eastern
sites associated with Abraham and Moses, Jesus and St. Paul, but it
also called for an examination of the church's conscience and
repentance for evils perpetrated in the church's name or tolerated
through its indifference.
</P>
<P>
   The letter urged a search for unity among Christians; more
interreligious dialogue, especially with Jews and Muslims; an
honoring of men and women (and not just Catholics) who have been
martyred for their beliefs in this century; and a renewed emphasis
on ``the church's preferential option for the poor and the
outcast.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the year 2000, the pope said, was nothing less
than ``a hermeneutical key'' for understanding his pontificate, and
one could see a synopsis of his concerns in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   It was striking how many things proposed in the letter have
already been accomplished or have been set in motion. The letter
also added pathos to the many ways in which these efforts have
fallen short of the pope's hopes, either because of things beyond
his control or because of opposition and suspicion stirred by his
policies.
</P>
<P>
   But why tie such an agenda specifically to the year 2000? ``In
Christianity,'' the pope wrote, ``time has a fundamental
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tertio Millennio Adveniente'' begins with a meditation on the
phrase ``the fullness of time.'' It is St. Paul's phrase: ``When
the fullness of time had come, God sent his son, born of a woman''
(Galatians 4:4). In Christ, God set forth his purpose, ``as a plan
for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in
heaven and things on earth'' (Ephesians 1:10). ``The fullness of
time'' is a resonant phrase, at once majestic and somehow
comforting, yet haunting and mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   What is this fullness of time? Certainly not the frenzied
busyness with which people fill their day at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   For Paul and for Pope John Paul II, the phrase refers both to
the coming of Christ 2000 years ago and to the Messianic age of
reconciliation that is yet to come. The fullness of time is a
culmination, a ripening, a cosmic event, in which what is beyond
time enters time and humanity receives a definitive promise of
transcending the limits of time.
</P>
<P>
   History is not just a speeding car, more or less out of control,
whose speedometer is about to flip over. History is a story, a
drama, with a turning point, climax and denouement. That is
something that can be affirmed even by those who do not believe in
this particular Christian cosmic story.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed those who share the pope's faith and those who do not can
find memorable many of the expressions that he uses: ``In Jesus
Christ, the word made flesh, time becomes a dimension of God, who
is himself eternal.'' Eternity enters time. Time is taken up into
eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Which imposes on Christians, the pope wrote, ``the duty to
sanctify time.'' Here, in fact, is one of those points of
convergence with other faiths. Holy days, sabbaths, seasons,
anniversaries, rites of the life cycle: John Paul could well have
embraced other religions in noting, ``The solar year is thus
permeated by the liturgical year.''
</P>
<P>
   One particular way of sanctifying time, rooted like Christianity
in the faith of Israel, is the jubilee, ``the year of the Lord's
favor'' proclaimed in the passage from Isaiah that the Gospel of
Luke described Jesus reading in the synagogue in Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   According to the law of Moses, the jubilee years, every 7th and
15th year, were times for freeing slaves, letting the earth lie
fallow and rejuvenate itself, restoring to each family its
ancestral land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jubilee year was meant to restore equality among all the
children of Israel,'' the pope wrote. Justice consisted in
protection for the weak, based on the conviction that ``the riches
of creation were to be considered as a common good of the whole of
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The new millennium, in this view, cannot be adequately
celebrated in a minute, an hour, an evening or a day. It will take
at least a year. After all, for Christians it calls to mind not a
changed calendar but a changed world.

Touched by an angel and filled with hope
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   LaJuan Moore smiles and nods proudly, as a motor underneath his
hospital bed begins to hum, the mattress shifting automatically and
moving his legs into another position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Claus came early,'' he says of the motorized bed.
</P>
<P>
   He is bright and happy. He is determined and full of ambition.
He is the centerpiece of a Christmas story that warms the heart and
brightens the day despite so much pain and so many challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If God didn't think I could handle this,'' he says, ``he
wouldn't have put me in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of a mother, a son and an angel of hope named
Sean Jones, a giant-hearted former Houston Oilers great who
probably never will spend another Christmas without thinking of the
kid that affected his life deeply.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sept. 30 at Butler Stadium. Moore, a talented junior
safety for the Sharpstown Apollos football team, was having the
game of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first quarter of that game against Westbury,
Moore already had five tackles. He was crushing ball-carriers and
knocking away passes, using speed and football instincts that
coaches called among the best on the team.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Moore had 10 tackles. By the third quarter, someone
told his mother, Charlotte Beverly, ``It's the LaJuan Moore show
tonight!''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly smiled and nodded, proudly wearing the bright green
colors of Sharpstown High and chanting with friends and family,
``LaJuan LaJuan LaJuan.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the third quarter, Moore saw the Westbury tight
end sprinting across the middle of the field. He stepped up to hit
the receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came straight at me,'' Moore said. ``I knew I'd get a good
hit on him, but I hit him kind of funny and just fell straight
down. I tried to get up, but I was just lying there looking around
and didn't know what was going on. My head hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly screamed when she heard the vicious collision involving
her son, but it was a scream of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him make that last tackle,'' Beverly said, ``and I just
turned away. I didn't think he was hurt, I just thought, `This
really is the LaJuan Moore show tonight.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Beverly's eldest son, Desmond, noticed LaJuan wasn't moving.
His sister, Berry, grabbed his mother by the arm and said,
``LaJuan's hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly descended to the bottom of the grandstands and began
pacing, looking for her son in the huddle as trainers and coaches
gathered around the player lying motionless on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started looking at the players in the huddle trying to find
No. 11,'' Beverly said. ``I said, `Where's No. 11? Where's LaJuan?
I started panicking and then I started praying. When I saw that it
was LaJuan on the ground I thought, `My baby's dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the night was a blur, a mother's worst nightmare. A
Sharpstown coach reached Beverly in the stands and said, ``You have
to come down here right now.''
</P>
<P>
   She stood on the field near medical personnel as trainers
clipped off LaJuan's chinstrap and unbolted his facemask. She
waited for 10 minutes, 15 minutes, as paramedics attended to her
son. LaJuan never moved. She boarded the ambulance and saw
paramedics cut the jersey from his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   She saw the blank expression on her son's face, a neck brace
carefully placed on him and doctors and nurses scurrying to her
son's side as they arrived at Hermann Hospital. She sat in the
waiting room, crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor came in and told me to sit down,'' Beverly said.
``He told me, `LaJuan is severely injured. He will never walk
again.' I don't know what I thought. I couldn't feel anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day _ Beverly's birthday _ she again sat in the waiting
room at Hermann as LaJuan underwent 10 hours of surgery after
fracturing the C-4 and C-5 vertabrae in his neck. His prognosis was
good, but he was a paraplegic, able to move his arms only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't ask why,'' Beverly said. ``You just try to deal with
it and be strong. You try to find some hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, hope doesn't come wrapped in Christmas paper and
sealed with a bow.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, hope is a 17-year-old kid with more perspective and
faith than anyone around him. And sometimes hope stands 6 feet, 6
inches tall, with broad shoulders, a Super Bowl ring and walks
through the door of the TIRR rehabilitation center and immediately
connects with a kid he never saw before.
</P>
<P>
   Only days after Moore's injury, Jones went to the rehab center
with Dallas Cowboys rookie defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban to visit
another player, Michael Mills, who suffered a similarly devastating
football injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked in there thinking maybe we could put a smile on
their faces,'' Jones said. ``But they put smiles on our faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones connected with the family, realizing Beverly had to take a
leave of absence from her job at a dry cleaners and had no means of
financially dealing with the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think they're having a hard day, but they
don't know what a hard day is,'' Jones said. ``When tragedy happens
you have to try and make some sense of it. Sometimes it's hard. But
you have to meet this kid to know how good a kid he is. I've never
seen him without a smile on his face. Sometimes he tells me not to
worry, that it's all going to be all right, and I don't have a
comeback. All I can do is smile. All I can do is try to help anyway
I can.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean has been like LaJuan's big brother,'' Beverly said. ``He
hasn't had to do anything that he's done for LaJuan, but he's been
like an angel to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones visited Moore regularly in the hospital and throughout his
rehabilitation, even attending a Sharpstown game in October and
watching from the sidelines with Moore. When a clerical error led
to Moore's Medicaid benefits being cut off two months after his
injury, Jones stepped in to help regain the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And when it became apparent the small one-bedroom apartment in
which Beverly alone raised her three children was not adequate for
Moore's condition, Jones opened a trust fund for the family at
Southwest Bank of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month when Beverly still could not return to work
as she cared for Moore and funds raised were not enough to pay for
an apartment, Jones stepped up again.
</P>
<P>
   He provided the family rent-free a two-bedroom condominium at a
complex he owns in southeast Houston. Jones also paid for the place
to be fitted with wider doorways, tile floors, a
wheelchair-accessible bathroom, a ramp at the entryway, a personal
parking space, appliances and even a trophy case for Moore's
numerous baseball, basketball and football awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean has made things happen,'' Beverly said. ``This is not
going to be easy, but he's been a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jones: ``I think about LaJuan a lot, and it puts things in
perspective for me. Here's an honor-roll student that had
everything in front of him, but there's no bitterness. He has no
bad feelings about anything. I'm telling you, he's taught me a lot.
I don't want any credit for anything. I wish Charlotte hadn't told
anybody about this, because LaJuan should get all the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   When the holidays are over, Moore plans to return as a full-time
student at Sharpstown. For now, he lays in his new bed in his new
home, with his tattered No. 11 jersey hanging on a wall in his
room, and he dreams of what is ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm accepting what happened,'' Moore said. ``I would have
loved to keep playing football, but it didn't work out. I'm still
the same person. I have my family and my friends. I still want to
make something with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Moore wants to attend college, although he is
not sure about a field of study. His prognosis is good and with
limited movement in his arms and a friend in Jones, he considers
this a very good Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't get sad,'' Moore said. ``I try to just think
about what I'm going to do next.''
</P>
<P>
   On a wall above Moore's bed is a copy of a poem he wrote for an
English class. It reads, in part: ``Moore lover of God, who needs
to become a better man who gives his best.''

   Five men said to be armed with grenades and rifles hijacked an
Indian Airlines passenger plane Friday and claimed to have killed
at least four of the 189 people on board during a forced odyssey
across India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 8 p.m. Eastern time Friday night, the plane set
off once again on its mysterious meandering journey, leaving behind
at an mili- tary air base in the United Arab Emirates about 25 of
the hostages and the body of a victim.
</P>
<P>
   The base, al-Manhad, outside of Dubai, was the third stop for
the A- 300 Airbus, which had left Katman- du, the capital of
Nepalese, 14 hours earlier on a flight to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after they were seen leaving the aircraft, the A300 Airbus
took off. Emirates officials, who had allowed the plane to land
after the nearby sultanate of Oman had refused it permission, said
the hijackers had agreed to free some of their hostages once the
plane refueled.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the hijackers, their demands and their intendednation remained a mystery. At one point in the erratic
journey, they ordered the pilot to fly to Afghanistan but the
ruling Taliban militia refused to allow the plane to land.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from both India and Pakistan said the gunmen spoke
Hindi, the official language of India and the predominant language
in the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the emirates said they had tried to negotiate the
re- lease of all 57 women and 13 children on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
   But after the plane had been re- fueled, the hijackers freed all
the children but only nine women. Indian officials said three men
were also released, as well as the body of a dead man.
</P>
<P>
   Like officials in some of the other airports where the plane
landed or tried to land, authorities in the emir- ates had made it
clear from the start that they did not intend to try to hold the
aircraft or confront the hijackers with force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will allow it to refuel and we will provide it with medical
aid and food if needed,'' Information Minister Abdullah bin Zayed
said. ``That airport is equipped with ambulances. We are not
interested in allowing them to stay for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in India had initially said the hijackers had told a
crew member that they had shot and killed four passengers during
the first forced landing, in Amritsar. The crew member reported the
statement to air-traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   But later, Indian aviation officials said they had been told by
their counterparts in Pakistan that no one had been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines officials said Flight IC 814, which left Katmandu at
4:25 p.m. local time, 5:55 a.m. Eastern time, had a crew of 11 and
178 passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, however, had conflicting reports on passengers'
nationalities. At least 154 were reported to be Indian and 8
Nepalese. Officials told Reuters that other passengers included
four Swiss, four Spaniards, a Japanese, a Canadian and a Belgian.
The nationalities of the other five passengers were not known.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, which is usually a one-hour trip, was seized about
30 minutes after it took off and just as the plane crossed into
Indian airspace.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers, armed with AK-47 rifles and grenades that they
had apparently carried when they boarded in Nepal, first ordered
the pilot fly to Lahore, Pakistan. After Pakistani authorities
denied them permission to land, the plane was allowed to land in
nearby Amritsar, in northwestern India, because it was running low
on fuel, with 20 minutes of flying time remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In Amritsar, the hijackers appeared to panic after having warned
authorities that they would begin killing passengers if anyone
tried to approach the plane except to refuel it. Airport officials
said the gunmen opened fire while the aircraft was on the ground
and then, without waiting for refueling, ordered the pilot to take
off.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said later that the pilot reported to air
controllers that the hijackers had told him that they had killed
four people and had injured several others.
</P>
<P>
   The plane again turned toward Lahore, sinking to an altitude of
just 500 feet before Pakistani officials finally agreed to let it
make an emergency landing on a darkened runway.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan had already sent army commandos to patrol the airport,
although officials tried hard to avoid having anything to do with
the plane. The airport manager, Ghulam Mustafa Mirani, told the
Agence France-Presse that the runway lights had been switched off
to prevent the plane from landing. Only when the plane was
dangerously close to a crash landing, Mirani said, did authorities
relent.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Islamabad said
permission was granted on humanitarian grounds after the pilot
reported that he was almost out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In Lahore, the hijackers demanded fuel and food but apparently
did not speak directly to officials. A spokesman for the
government, General Rashid Qureshi, said the hijackers made their
demands through the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   After 2 1-2 hours in Lahore, the plane again took off without
releasing any people. The gunmen ordered the pilot to fly to
Afghanistan, the authorities said. But it was again denied landing
permission.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan Islamic Press, in a report from the southern Afghan
city of Kandahar monitored by the British broadcasters, said the
civil aviation minister of the Taliban, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor,
refused a request to land at Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known why the Afghans, who have close relations with
Pakistan, refused. In any case, press reports from the region said
the Kabul airport, badly damaged in years of war and civil strife,
does not have operating radar that would assist a pilot in making a
night landing.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts speculated that the hijacking could be linked
to the disputed territory of Kashmir, the object of a long and
bitter struggle between India and Pakistan that heated up into a
military confrontation this year.

ACCUSED OF STRIKE PLOT, 40 INMATES ARE MOVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NINA SIEGAL  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forty inmates were transferred out of a maximum-security prison
in upstate New York on Friday after correction officials discovered
that they were planning a strike, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The move added to widespread worries among prison officials that
inmates statewide were planning a work stoppage or protest that
could begin on New Year's Day. Over the last few months, inmate
advocates, prisoners' relatives and prison guards have reported
widespread organizing of inmates in at least three state prisons in
preparation for a work stoppage. The transfers from the Green Haven
Correctional Facility in Stormville on Friday was the most recent
evidence that an inmate strike was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   State Corrections Commissioner Glenn Goord ordered a lockdown at
Green Haven, which is about 95 miles south of Albany. He had the 40
inmates sent to other maximum-security prisons around the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This small group of inmates,'' he said, ``was attempting to
strong-arm unwilling inmates into supporting some unspecified work
stoppage in the future.''
   About 1,800 inmates at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility, in
Ossining, were also placed under lockdown Friday after five rounds
of 9-millimeter ammunition were found in a common area, officials
said. That incident was unrelated to the threatened strike, prison
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have said that rumors frequently arise that
inmates will refuse to do their prison jobs, but inmate advocates
said this threat was unusual because it was being organized at
prisons statewide, rather than at an individual institution. About
half the 72,000 inmates in state prisons work at jobs for an
average of $1.05 a day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   James Flateau, a spokesman for the Department of Correction,
confirmed the reports this week that there had been rumors of a
strike, but he declined to discuss preparations the department is
making to handle possible disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that inmates in more than one state prison had
been disciplined for having a copy of a letter calling for a
strike.
</P>
<P>
   The unsigned letter, titled ``Wake Up,'' urges inmates to
protest the state's parole polices, which the authors said are
unduly harsh, by refusing to perform their jobs or leave their
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inmates who are found with that document are being
disciplined,'' Flateau said. ``Some are being transferred to other
facilities; some are being locked up in their cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Protests have already taken place at Green Haven, in Dutchess
County, and at Sing Sing. Forty-five inmates were transferred from
Green Haven to other state prisons in November because of their
involvement in plotting the work stoppage, Flateau said. Inmates in
other state prisons, like the Fishkill Correctional Facility in
Beacon, have told outside contacts of their intent to stop work.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Fitzpatrick, director of public relations for the New York
State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association, a
union that represents state prison guards, said organizing efforts
of this magnitude were very rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times in every facility when the inmates are
spreading rumors, and generally it is isolated to a particular
facility,'' he said. ``This is a bit different because it's trying
to be generated statewide.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudette Spencer, staff lawyer with the Prisoners' Rights
Project of the Legal Aid Society of New York, said many inmates
were angry because they believed they had been perfunctorily denied
parole, without proper consideration of their behavior in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Green, executive director of the Center for Law and
Justice in Albany, a inmate advocacy group, said: ``There's a core
of people who feel that there's nothing to work for, there's
nothing to work towards, because they have the feeling they're not
going to ever get out. Others are concerned that they think their
labor is being exploited in the system, and that they're being kept
in the system longer to support what they call the prison
industrial complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Most inmates employed in the prison system perform jobs that
help the prison function, like doing laundry or working in the
prison mess hall. Others are trained in general carpentry,
electrical work or plumbing. About 3,500 inmates across the state
earn about 75 cents an hour working for Corcraft, the correction
department's manufacturing division, which makes furniture,
wastebaskets, soap, inmate clothing and other products for sale to
government agencies and nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick of the correctional officers' union said he was
concerned that a strike by inmate workers could lead to rioting.
``If you have a faction within the facility that breaks ranks and
decides to go ahead and go to work, or go ahead and eat in the mess
hall, then you've got one faction in the prison against another,''
he said. ``It's not a healthy situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legal Aid Society of New York, which runs a program for
families of inmates, has warned clients that disruptive protests in
prison are not protected by the First Amendment, and could lead to
disciplinary action. Ms. Spencer said Legal Aid was investigating
recent parole board decisions, and might file a class action
lawsuit next year on behalf of inmates who believe they were
unfairly denied parole.

MAURICE COUVE DE MURVILLE, 92, GAULLIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALISON SMALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maurice Couve de Murville, France's longest-serving foreign
minister and the cool embodiment of Gaullist detachment toward the
United States and the Atlantic alliance, died Friday. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   His family and the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic party,
announcing the death, did not say where it had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Couve de Murville served de Gaulle for 10 years as foreign
minister, before becoming first his finance minister and then,
after the 1968 student revolt against de Gaulle, as prime minister.
He served about a year in that post.
</P>
<P>
   France's current foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, lauded Couve
de Murville as ``a great ambassador'' for his country.
</P>
<P>
   An impeccable diplomat, Couve de Murville was born Jan. 24,
1907, in Rheims, the son of a judge and scion of a well-known
family of France's Protestant minority. He glided through his
country's most elite schools, earning a doctorate in law and a
degree in literature from the Sorbonne and graduating No. 1 from
the Ecole des Sciences Politiques, from which France has
traditionally drawn its senior civil servants. He joined the
Finance Ministry at the young age of 23, and within 10 years had
risen to one of its most senior posts.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Couve de Murville at first stayed in
France, serving the Vichy government that collaborated with the
occupying Nazis. But in 1943, he fled to Algiers to serve the Free
French administration that eventually came under de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Couve de Murville served as ambassador to Italy,
Egypt, the United States and West Germany. An ardent golfer, he was
reportedly on the links in 1958 when the newly elected President de
Gaulle made contact with him and asked to be foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Couve de Murville went on to outdo Talleyrand by serving a
decade as foreign minister, becoming known as ``Monsieur Cool'' for
his unruffled aplomb. Like his master, de Gaulle, whom he served
loyally, he had a world view that was firmly centered on France.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, this insistence on the identity and concerns
of France sometimes set the government in Paris apart from
Washington. While Couve de Murville, who spoke near-perfect
English, was a strong proponent of making no concessions to the
Soviet Union, his government also raised American eyebrows by
drawing closer to China.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about those policies in an interview in U.S. News and
World Report in March 1964, he analyzed the reasons for differences
with America. ``It may happen _ and in fact it has happened _ that
our policy is not along the same lines as the policy of the United
States,'' he said. ``It's not because we want it to be different.
It is because our thinking is different.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, for emphasis: ``It may happen that our interests are
not the same as yours, because we are here, and you are on the
other side of the Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, France pulled out of NATO's integrated military
command. It has never rejoined.
</P>
<P>
   The May 1968 riots that rattled the Gaullist government saw
Couve de Murville transferred from the foreign to the finance
ministry, and then to the prime minister's office. When de Gaulle
resigned as president in 1969 after losing a referendum on reform
of the political system, Couve de Murville stayed on as caretaker
until another former prime minister, Georges Pompidou, was elected
president in June.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Couve de Murville was elected to the Senate, the upper
house of Parliament, a seat he held until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He married Jacqueline Schweisguth, an amateur painter, in 1932.
They had three daughters, and several grandchildren.

DEADBEAT U.N. DIPLOMATS A HEADACHE FOR LANDLORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By COREY KILGANNON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The minister of the Mission of Guinea-Bissau sat in
his darkened office one afternoon last week, near a large window
overlooking East 43rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, Joao De Gama, was working alone in the seven-room
office because the mission's staff, once eight people, has been
cut, for the most part, to one: De Gama. He was working in darkness
because the landlord recently cut off the electricity.
Guinea-Bissau has not paid the rent in 15 months. De Gama keeps his
cell phone handy because the office phone service has also been
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   There was more activity a block away, at the Liberian Consulate,
at 820 Second Ave., as officials in suits paced around the
13th-floor office suite with cell phones. Again the office was
almost completely dark. A secretary sitting in one pitch-black
office room turned on a battery-powered camping lantern to tell a
reporter that late last month, the building's management cut the
electricity to the mission and consulate, which has not paid its
rent in five months, an outstanding bill of roughly $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries are getting over civil wars in their homelands
and have interim governments that are not financing the missions.
And local landlords say that this is not a unique situation around
the United Nations. At any given time, several diplomatic offices
are having financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   In their darkest hours, the missions of economically wobbly, and
often warring, countries often stop paying rent (and officials'
salaries) without permission. Since they have diplomatic status,
landlords cannot evict them. Even court judgments ordering
diplomats to pay back rent cannot be enforced, so frustrated
landlords often apply pressure by cutting electricity, heat and
sometimes phone lines. So an African civil war can really hang up a
landlord in Turtle Bay, the East Side neighborhood near the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia and Guinea-Bissau are among 19 countries that have not
paid their UN dues in at least two years. Liberia lost its voting
rights in the Security Council, said Farhan Haq, a UN spokesman,
but Guinea-Bissau has been allowed to keep its vote because of
``extenuating financial hardship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Deadbeat diplomats are more of a problem in New York City than
in other parts of the world because office space is so expensive,
Haq said. ``Rents around here are very high,'' he said, and that
poses a special hardship for poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Rwanda's new government refused to pay expenses
incurred by its previous government, Haq said. And just before
Zaire became Congo, the outgoing Zaire ambassador took some
appliances from the mission and began conducting business out of
his New Jersey home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real history of missions having problems paying
rent and maintaining their facilities,'' Haq said. ``Desperate
things happen during changes of governments, but it's really
between them and their landlord and the City of New York.
Diplomatic immunity protects them from legal penalty while doing
their diplomatic work, so we stay out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvyn Kaufman, who is a part owner of several East Side office
buildings, has had several diplomatic tenants who stopped paying
rent but stayed in the offices, often without electricity,
telephone lines or even heat.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman has won various judgments for millions of dollars over
the years, but has never gotten any government agency to enforce
them, so he will no longer rent space to diplomats. ``We won't
touch them anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   De Gama of the Guinea-Bissau mission said that a year-long civil
war ended in his country in August, and the interim government has
cut funding. With no salary, he said, he gets by using money from a
modest expense account, but there is not enough to pay the
$6,000-per-month rent, which includes utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell your landlord he should wait for the rent
because your country's having a civil war,'' he said. ``We didn't
come here to cause problems, and we don't want to abuse our
diplomatic security. It's embarrassing, but we have work to do.
Where can we go?''
</P>
<P>
   The mission's office building at 211 E. 43rd St. is owned by
Eastgate Realty. ``We can't evict them,'' said Robert Hinds, a vice
president of Eastgate, ``so the only thing we can do is shut down
their electricity and hope they pay. I tried contacting all the
politicians, the governor, mayor, congressmen, the U.S. Mission.
Nothing works.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad, Bolivia and Mauritius are also tenants that are constantly
late with rent, he said, but they eventually pay up. And then,
Hinds said, there is Bangladesh, ``One of the world's poorest
countries. They pay like clockwork. It's unbelievable.''

THE AD CAMPAIGN: AN EMPHASIS ON GORE'S EXPERIENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This 30-second commercial is the seventh from Vice President Al
Gore. It discusses his experience and is being broadcast in Iowa
and New Hampshire beginning this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Century-Media.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The question is posed on a black screen: ``How
much experience does America need?'' Live color shots of Gore with
regular people appear sequentially as he talks about Social
Security (he hugs an elderly person), schools (a teacher appears
with children in a classroom), the environment (a spray of cherry
blossoms) and the economy (a roof-raising). Gore appears at the end
in a blue suit reviewing a piece of paper.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: A male voice narrates: ``How much experience does
America need? To protect Social Security from those who want to
raise the retirement age? To really take on the big drug companies
and get affordable prescription drugs? To fight against vouchers
that drain money from public schools? To preserve Medicaid and
strengthen Medicare? To keep our environment clean and our economy
strong? How much experience does America need? All it can get.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: There are no factual claims in this commercial, but
there are several dubious implications. One is that the Social
Security retirement age is unchanging. In fact, the age at which
one can retire and receive full benefits is already scheduled to
climb gradually, to 67 from 65, over 24 years that begin in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying supposition is that former Sen. Bill Bradley,
Gore's lone rival for the Democratic nomination, lacks the
experience to manage the big issues facing the country and that he
would do things detrimental to the national interest, or at least
the Democratic interest, like raise the retirement age. Bradley has
equivocated on raising the age, saying that all options should be
on the table. But Gore has not said specifically how he would shore
up Social Security either, saying only, ``I'm not for raising the
retirement age.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference to taking on ``the big drug companies'' is a
further dig at Bradley who, as a senator from New Jersey, received
significant financial contributions from those companies, many of
which are based in New Jersey. Other New Jersey Democrats,
including Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who has endorsed Gore, are also
mindful of the pharmaceutical industry's importance to their home
state and have voted accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   On school vouchers, Bradley has voted to allow experiments using
them while Gore opposed doing so.Gore is also reminding viewers
that Bradley has proposed eliminating Medicaid, although he would
replace it with other health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: Like previous Gore advertisements, this one inches
closer and closer to a direct attack on Bradley's proposals, though
it does not name the former senator. Gore is trying to reach the
core Democratic constituency groups _ the elderly, teachers,
blue-collar workers _ and hoping to spur them to the polls to save
these fundamental Democratic programs by voting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has only recently begun to emphasize his experience as a
qualification for the job of president. In this commercial, he
suggests he has the experience to maintain the status quo, that is,
the booming economy, without tinkering with core Democratic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   This spot will probably be followed by more that spell out in
even tougher language the threat that Gore believes a Bradley
presidency would pose.
</P>
<P>
   Four advertisements for Gore are available from The New York
Times on the Web at www.nytimes.com/politics

VLADIMIR KONDRASHIN, 70, COACH OF 1972 SOVIET BASKETBALL TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL AMDUR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vladimir Kondrashin, the coach who masterminded the Soviet
Union's controversial last-second upset of the United States' men's
basketball team for the gold medal at the 1972 Munich Olympics,
died Thursday of cancer at a hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia. He
was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union's improbable early-morning 51-50 victory that
ended a 63-game U.S. Olympic winning streak remains one of the
defining games in the history of the sport, on a par in this
century with the American men's upset of the Soviet hockey team
during the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had never lost an Olympic basketball game. It
took the lead on two foul shots by Doug Collins with three seconds
left, and the team thought the game was over after twice foiling
Soviet inbounds plays. But officials ordered the clock reset, and
Kondrashin then designed a play that produced a length-of-the-court
pass to his favorite player, Aleksandr Belov, and a game-winning
basket that stunned the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair and square,'' is how Kondrashin described the finish,
which included a crucial substitution of Ivan Edeshko, a former
handball player, to throw the ``golden pass'' over Tom McMillen
that Belov caught after knocking down two American defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans badly underestimated the strength of our team,''
Edeshko told The Los Angeles Times 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   A formal postgame protest by angry U.S. officials was rejected,
and the 12 American players refused to accept their silver medals
at the victory ceremony. They have still never been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kondrashin's patience and belief in his players that
helped usher in the globalization of the sport. Hailed as a
disciplinarian and tactician who listed Bobby Knight, Dean Smith
and Dave Gavitt as close coaching friends, Kondrashin returned as a
hero after Munich and guided the national team to its first title
at the world championships two years later. His pledge of continued
success was met with indifference by Soviet officials after a
third-place finish at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, and Kondrashin
was removed as coach of the national team.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup of the Soviet Union fragmented the quality of
basketball in the country and frustrated Kondrashin in recent years
while he coached the St. Petersburg Spartak team in the Russian
league.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters in 1993 of the indifference of his
countrymen to basketball, he said: ``There can be no good play
without good players. And we have practically no players left.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Yuri.

STRAY BULLETS ARE CAUSE FOR CONCERN ON NEW YEAR'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - The last place you'll find Steve Martin, now that he
doesn't have to work New Year's Eve, is at an outdoor street
festival in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to be out on Phoenix streets on New Year's Eve
for one pretty major reason, stray bullets!'' said Martin, 27, a
manu facturing supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Random gunfire on New Year's Eve is as traditional as singing
Auld Lang Syne at the stroke of mid night. But this year, as
revelers ring in what they consider a new millen nium, even the
cops are taking cover and advising residents to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   From about 10 minutes till mid night and 10 minutes after, ``we
encourage officers to go out to a safe area,'' said Sgt. Jeff
Halstead, a Phoenix police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There's two reasons for the advice to officers: to avoid
becoming targets and to be rested and ready for the flood of calls
to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a busy time right after midnight, because we have a
lot of things that come down the line,'' Halstead said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, more gunfire has been ringing across the
Phoenix area on a daily basis as the population and number of guns
has grown. This summer, Shannon Smith, 14, was struck dead by a
falling bullet in her back yard. The shot could have come from as
far as a half-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   For police, the pop-pop-pop of gunfire, especially on New Year's
Eve and the Fourth of July, is hard to track down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear them non-stop throughout this time,'' Halstead said.
``We try to tell our officers, `Don't get caught up in this
mind-set that you need to track it down.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the safety issue extends beyond officers working a beat on
the street.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Van Leeuwen, a hair stylist at Salon Phoenix, said one
officer who patrols her historic downtown Phoenix neighborhood
urged her to leave town altogether for the holi day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like World War II with gunfire in constant directions for
two hours,'' Van Leeuwen said. ``Last year, I was calling the
police from inside my house, and they thought I was standing
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Leeuwen is taking the advice this year: She's packing up her
dog and going to Tempe to spend a quiet New Year's Eve with a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' she said. ``I love my house and shouldn't have to
be laying low below the glass line of my windows for four hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem of random gunfire is so great that Phoenix Police
Chief Harold Hurtt issued a statement to the news media this week
urging residents to hold their fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This activity, random gunfire, is a serious and growing
problem in our community,'' Hurtt said. ``Ran dom gunfire places
additional de mands on the already burdensome requests for public
safety interven tion during the New Year's Eve celebrations.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is not limited to traditional nights of
celebration. Phoenix police responded to more than 13,212 calls of
random gunfire from Dec. 31 through Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   For Martin and others, that's enough to keep him inside as much
as possible on New Year's Eve. He's considering attending the Tempe
Block Party but plans on being in one of downtown's bars during the
peak celebration hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'll be inside most of the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin also is relieved he isn't working the second shift at
makeup manufacturer Revlon, near 43rd Avenue and Buckeye Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``My truck would be full of holes by the time I get off, or I'd
get hit just walking out to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, people are killed and seriously injured by these
gun-firing idiots, most of whom are too intoxicated to contemplate
the con sequences of their actions _ for example, what goes up must
come down.'' &QL;

FELICIA LAMPORT, 83, A SATIRIST DEVOTED TO RHYME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Felicia Lamport, a poet and satirist who took delight in
skewering the high and mighty with verse, quips, puns and parodies,
most of them first appearing in a column in The Boston Globe called
Muse of the Week in Review, died on Thursday at her home in
Cambridge, Mass. She was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lamport's column appeared in The Globe since 1981 but her
work also appeared in The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly,
Harper's and other publications.
</P>
<P>
   Her first collection of poetry, ``Mink on Weekdays (Ermine on
Sunday)'' (1950), became a best seller and was followed by other
collections with titles like ``Scrap Irony'' (1961), ``Cultural
Slag'' (1966) and ``Political Plumlines'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   She was born in New York and graduated from Vassar College in
1937, after which she worked as a reporter and wrote dialogue for
MGM films.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, Benjamin Kaplan, a retired
justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts; a son,
James Kaplan of Northampton, Mass.; a daughter, Nancy Mansbach of
Newton, Mass., and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   She was particularly remembered for a work called ``The Love
Song of R. Milhous Nixon,'' in which she borrowed from T.S. Eliot
to lampoon President Nixon at the height of the Watergate scandal
in 1973. It began:
</P>
<P>
   Let us go then, in my plane,
</P>
<P>
   For a weekend of repose in Key Biscayne;
</P>
<P>
   When the view beneath our eyes appears unstable
</P>
<P>
   Let us banish all incipient defeats
</P>
<P>
   In one of my retreats.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from political jabs, Ms. Lamport also turned her attention
to the human comedy, with verse like:
</P>
<P>
   The after-effects of a mother's neglects
</P>
<P>
   May spoil her boy's orientation to sex,
</P>
<P>
   But the converse is worse: if she overprotects,
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of Oedipus wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   In April William Safire praised Ms. Lamport in The New York
Times Magazine as ``the leading muse of the Deprefixers,'' which he
defined as poets who achieve effects by dropping prefixes, for
lines like ``Men often pursue in suitable style/The imical girl
with the scrutable smile.''

EDITORIAL: THIS MILLENNIAL CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 25:
</P>
<P>
   The list of things we will do for the last time in this century
and this millennium grows shorter and shorter as the minutes and
seconds pass. But few of those things feel more meaningful than
celebrating today the final Christmas in this old epoch, our
long-familiar calendrical home.
</P>
<P>
   It was the problem of Easter's date that led a Scythian-born
monk in the sixth century to determine the Roman year of Jesus'
birth and to designate a new era, a Christian re-reckoning of time,
beginning there. The current scholarly judgment is that the
historical Jesus was probably born around 4 or 6 B.C. And yet the
popular idea prevails, though there are no carols or hymns to quite
this effect, that on that ancient, first Christmas in Bethlehem so
long ago, the one told in Luke, the counting of time began all over
again, an old world departing and a new one ringing itself in to
the sound of a heavenly host.
</P>
<P>
   If that first Christmas is not a matter of strict calendrical
accuracy _ the actual dividing line between B.C. and A.D. _
Christmas is still a matter of joyful spiritual reality for
millions of Christians around the world. For them, it is not only a
holy day, it is also, in a sense, the most human day in the
liturgical calendar, a day on which the possibility of human
innocence is renewed with the birth in humble surroundings of a
divine infant. The humility of that birth expresses for Christians
the re-ordering of the world, the hope for a kingdom of the spirit
instead of the flesh. It expresses, in the darkest week of the
year, a sense of rejuvenation even stronger in its way than the
light of the returning sun, which has just passed its solstice and
is heading north once more.
</P>
<P>
   In painting after painting over the past half-dozen centuries,
the circumstances of the Nativity have been transposed from the
Holy Land to more familiar, more local settings. It surprises no
one to see in a painting by Van Eyck, for instance, the outlines of
a medieval city or the elements of a Germanic landscape rising
behind the manger and the wise men, any more than it surprises us
to see a creche on the lawn of a Catholic or Methodist church in
some small American town. Our society has carried that
transposition a little farther, from a sacred setting to a secular
one. For many, Christmas has become the principal seasonal
celebration of the year, a resoundingly commercial, exuberant, and
yet still spiritual interlude, a time of rejuvenation and
compulsive spending. This is, for many of us, the emotional nexus
of the year, when tight-fisted Scrooge, a man with one kind of
wealth, turns into free-handed Santa, a man who is rich in very
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas has grown so large over the past two centuries, so
important in the lives of families and on the balance sheets of
retailers, that it seems almost like a force of nature. But it is
worth wondering why it has become so, especially today on the last
Christmas of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, well beyond living memory, the year was filled with
festivals, feast days and holidays. They were a way of marking for
ordinary people the movement of time and the seasons, a way of
honoring the sanctity of social and cultural obligations. They
reflected the living rituals of the agricultural year, the
succession of sowing and haying and harvesting, as well as the
rites of the church, the passages of marriage and birth and death.
Above all, they offered relaxation and entertainment, as well as
momentary glimpses of abundance amid lives of predictable, routine
leanness.
</P>
<P>
   But leisure is all around us now, no longer pared with
difficulty from an unbroken calendar of hard labor. Abundance is an
everyday meal. Entertainment is an industry, the very vernacular of
our existence. Ours is a world that has steadily lost its
observances and its feast days, the sense of festal, ritual
succession. Their elements have been dispersed across the ordinary
working week, and the holidays themselves have been rationalized to
the point where they scarcely differ more from one another than
Tuesday does from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Christmas, like the most holy days of other faiths, reminds
us that there is something about a holiday that is larger than
leisure, abundance or entertainment, something that is indefinable
and ancient. It is an atavism we still feel, an ecstatic song about
to break from our lips, commemorating, among other things, the
moment we occupy in time.
</P>
<P>
   As the ritual life dwindles, these special days grow and grow,
reminding us that we cannot live without it. It cannot simply be
dissolved into the flow of the everyday world. It is part of our
nature to need days that lie outside of time, days that gather the
seasons around them, and so transform them. We still feel the old
need to transpose ourselves now and then, to step out of our
seamless lives and into a world that is richer in symbols, more
expressive of the emotional path we tread through the year.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas comes to proclaim that venerable instinct of human
nature, now and into the time ahead.

Texas' freshmen impressive, if seldom seen, in 1999
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JEROME SOLOMON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ In a week, the decade and the University of Texas' 1999
football season will come to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns will deem their season a success regardless of
what happens in the Cotton Bowl against Arkansas on New Year's Day;
a handful of lows can't overshadow the abundance of highs they
experienced in their surprising run to the Big 12 Championship
Game.
</P>
<P>
   For the Longhorns' 24 freshmen, tabbed by most experts as the
No. 1 recruiting class in the country, the Cotton Bowl is not about
closure. To paraphrase Karen Carpenter, they have only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season has gone by so fast,'' freshman Roderick Babers of
Houston said. ``It blew by. That's what the older guys said. Now, I
know it because it seemed like just yesterday we were reporting in
on Aug. 2 for two-a-days and now we're getting ready to play the
last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to me how fast things have gone by. But that's
the way it's going to be, so you have to take advantage of every
time you're out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what this group of freshmen tried to do, in what, for
most, were limited opportunities. Half the freshmen on the roster
saw no action, taking a redshirt season.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who played, only Babers, a cornerback on specialty
defenses, and quarterback Chris Simms earned starts.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Dockery, the offensive lineman from Garland, saw
extensive playing time as the third guard, regularly subbing for
senior Roger Roesler. Kenny Hayter saw action in seven games at
running back and was third on the team in rushing attempts, but had
just 33 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Babers led the freshmen in tackles with 28, 23
solo, and he topped all defensive backs with three sacks. Cory
Redding (26 tackles) made his way into the defensive line rotation.
</P>
<P>
   And the group has gone through some drastic changes.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Stevens, star tight end at Cy-Fair, has moved to fullback.
O.J. McClintock, star receiver at Round Rock Westwood, is looking
to make his mark as a linebacker. Robo-backer Redding, about whom
teammates rave, is robo-end Redding.
</P>
<P>
   Redding points to Babers' spiritual growth as one of the more
poihanges among the new breed, citing his earnest
participation in a weekly Bible study/prayer group that has quietly
become a popular activity among college athletes.
</P>
<P>
   On a lighter note, according to Simms and Babers, none of the
transformations was more pronounced than that of defensive lineman
Tillman Holloway (Basalt, Colo.), who began the season shy and
reserved and ends it as a chatterbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not say a word the first three weeks he was here and
now he won't shut up,'' Simms said. ``It's really amazing. He just
talks and talks, until you just got to get away from him or your
ear's going to pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms is not shy about sharing a good-natured jab or two with
his classmates, though he said he is still too ``New Jersey-ized,''
to have a Texas twang; don't expect a ``y'all'' to be among his
utterances.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, the heralded group wanted to make more noise on the
field this season, but the players realize that will come with
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a group I can't say enough about how great a year it's
been,'' Simms said. ``We're at one of the best universities in the
country and we play for one of the best college football teams in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've handled it well. Everyone is used to being a star in
high school, but you get here and you're kind of the unknown
soldier. But we all know it's a great opportunity and we need to
keep working hard and hopefully you'll get to play a lot one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that day comes, the freshmen need to learn some things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I could learn so much,'' said Redding, who is
from Houston. ``You've got meetings, you've got football, you've
got school, and rewind it and you've got meetings, you've got
football, you've got school. I thought I already knew everything
about football.''
</P>
<P>
   In what can only be viewed as shocking news to those he has
manhandled on the field, Redding said the biggest difference in him
after a full season of college ball is he has learned to be meaner
than he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really take too much,'' Redding said. ``My whole
attitude is tougher. I've moved it up to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   Redding, who was USA Today's national Defensive Player of the
Year after his career at North Shore, authored some vicious hits on
special teams and picked up three sacks but didn't have the impact
on defense he would have liked. Still, he had 26 tackles and was
chosen the Big 12 Freshman Defensive Player of the Year in a vote
by the league's coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled a little bit because I don't feel I have the
weight to hold the position,'' said the 245-pound Redding. ``But I
feel with a year of strength and conditioning with Mad Dog (coach
Jeff Madden), I'll put on the weight I need to and I will keep the
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of speed, Babers, who played at Lamar, toyed with
opposing offenses in high school, almost daring them to throw his
way. But on this level, he found out he is not as fast or as good
as he thought. At least that was his impression early.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else, including his coaches, see it differently. Babers
just has high standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more things you need to know, compared to high
school football, because the speed of the game is so different,''
Babers said. ``It's more about a football education than just going
out there and using my physical skills. Once I learn everything, my
physical skills will catch up to all of that and I will be on the
level I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   As the individuals reach personal levels of accomplishment, so
shall the freshman class. And as it improves, so shall the
Longhorns. At least that's what the youngsters believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players in this class will do way more and be even better
players than what they're hyped up to be,'' Babers said. ``I have
no doubt about it. The skills that are in this group make it
special. A lot of guys are maturing physically, mentally and
spiritually. This class is going to shock a lot of people. We're
going to surpass the expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider ourselves a very special group. Even though we're
team players, we still have our pride in our class. And everybody
believes we're going to win a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to win the national championship every year. We
didn't get it this year, but we're working for that next year.
That's the next goal. There's a lot of pride in this class. We joke
about it all the time that there will never be another class as
good as this one. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we will.

LAKERS BRACE FOR REMATCH WITH SPURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Guess who's been invited to Christmas dinner?
</P>
<P>
   Hint: It's worse than the in-laws, or the neighbor with the Ford
Pinto parked on his lawn.
</P>
<P>
   By decree of the NBA schedule makers, the San Antonio Spurs will
spend this festive evening in the Los Angeles Lakers' new home. The
hosts can only hope their guests treat Staples Center more kindly
than they did the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   In the Spurs' last trip to Los Angeles, they turned the Forum's
finaleinto a 4-0 playoffs sweep of the Lakers, then went on to
claim the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have recovered nicely from that meltdown and take an
NBA-best 22-5 record into tonight's game, the first meeting with
the Spurs since May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big game,'' Kobe Bryant said, ``it's a big game. It's a
big challenge for us to see where we are as a team. We haven't been
in a real close game in a long time, so it's going to be
interesting to see how we execute when it comes down to crucial
moments.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this rematch will bear little resemblance to the
playoffseries, no matter what happens.
</P>
<P>
   Spurs playoff hero Sean Elliott is now a broadcaster, trying to
come back after a kidney transplant. Will Perdue, San Antonio's
third tower who ensured Shaquille O'Neal always had two 7-footers
to contend with at once, signed with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have struggled to a 7-7 road record and are clearly
not the dominant team they were just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still have a pretty good team,'' O'Neal said. ``We know
they'regoing to be pumped. So we just have to do everything
right.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a refreshing change for the Lakers, considering
how muchwent wrong in the Western Conference semifinals. They lost
two close games at the Alamodome, then got routed twice at home, by
an average of 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Twin towers Tim Duncan and David Robinson combined to make
O'Neal a footnote with ferocious defense. The Lakers' bench was
nonexistent. Their defense was woeful, as Duncan averaged 29 points
and role players like Jaren Jackson beat them from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers, like the Spurs, are not the same team. Coach
Phil Jackson has molded them into a defense-minded unit, holding
opponents to 89.1 points per game and 40.5 percent field-goal
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   A.C. Green has provided a much-needed steady presence at power
forward, and even the Lakers' stars Bryant, O'Neal and Glen Rice
have improved since last season. Credit the triangle offense for
some of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different team,'' Bryant said, ``because the
system is completely different. The key personnel is pretty much
the same, but we're in a different system. ... So San Antonio has a
whole different look (to deal with) as opposed to last year. It's a
huge advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The triangle offense is so mobile, you get to do things
against a team like San Antonio, who has big guys that clog up the
lane. ... You cando certain things to bring them away from the
basket. So it's a huge advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, however, has changed with regard to O'Neal's challenge.
On defense, he'll probably defend Duncan and Robinson (though
Jackson hinted he'll spend more time on Duncan than in the past).
And on offense, O'Neal still has to fight through the most
intimidating double team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``One athletic center versus two athletic centers is probably
always going to be difficult,'' O'Neal acknowledged, ``but they're
going to haveto double me. They can't play me straight up. If they
double, they probably can be effective, but if they double, I'm
just going to try to get the ball to somebody open. But I'm not
worried about single coverage at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers don't seem to be worried about the outcome,
either. No matter the intrigue involved in this rematch, Jackson
said he's not treating this game, the first of four against the
Spurs this season, as any sort of barometer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what happens (tonight),'' O'Neal said, ``there's
still a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Jackson had his players participate in a ``Secret Santa''
gift exchange, and it appears Derek Fisher got the most out of it.
Though there was a supposed $1,000 limit, Fisher received a
platinum Rolex from his Santa O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in limits when it comesto taking care of
friends and family,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   The gift exchange was a first for the Lakers, and Jackson seemed
pleased at their response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a lot of laughter coming out of that locker room,'' he
said. ``(The gift exchange) is just something I've always done ...
where theyhave to think about a teammate and make some concessions
and put themselves in somebody else's shoes, as to what they think
this person would want. Usually it's a lot of fun.''

   Five Sikh men said to be armed with grenades and rifles hijacked
an Indian Airlines passenger plane Friday and claimed to have
killed at least four of the 189 people on board during a forced
odyssey across India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf
be- fore landing in Kandahar, Afghani- stan, shortly after 10 p.m.
Eastern time Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Some two hours earlier, the air- craft took off from a military
air base in the United Arab Emirates for an unknown destination.
That leg be- gan nearly 14 hours after the gun- men had
commandeered the plane and after its third refueling stop.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 passengers, identified in news reports as some of the
women, children and injured people on board, were released after
the five-hour stopover at the al-Manhad military base outside
Dubai. There were also reports that one body was taken from the
plane. Soon after, the A-300 Airbus took off. Emirates officials,
who had allowed the plane to land after nearby Oman had refused
per- mission, said the hijackers had agreed to free some hostages
after the plane had been refueled.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the hijackers, their demands and their intended
destination remained a mystery. At one point in the erratic
journey, they ordered the pilot to fly to Afghanistan but the
ruling Taliban militia refused to allow the plane to land.
</P>
<P>
   The men were confirmed as Sikhs,  &UR; &AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP; &LR;  the BBC
reported Friday night, and both Indian and Pakistani officials said
the gunmen spoke Hindi, the official language of India and the
predominant language in the north- ern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was originally bound for New Delhi from Katmandu, the
capi- tal of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the emirates said they were trying to negotiate
the release of women and children, but did not intend to try to
hold the aircraft. They said they did not have information about
the condition of the passengers and crew members and could not
confirm whether any- one had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will allow it to refuel and we will provide it with medical
aid and food if needed,'' Information Minister Abdullah bin Zayed
said. ``That airport is equipped with ambulances. We are not
interested in allowing them to stay for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in India had initially said the hijackers had told a
crew member that they had shot and killed four passengers during
the first forced landing, in Amritsar. The crew member reported the
statement to air-traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   But later, Indian aviation officials said they had been told by
their counterparts in Pakistan that no one had been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines officials said Flight IC 814, which left Katmandu at
4:25 p.m. local time, 5:55 a.m. Eastern time, had a crew of 11 and
178 passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, however, had conflicting reports on passengers'
nationalities. At least 154 were reported to be Indian and 8
Nepalese. Officials told Reuters that other passengers included
four Swiss, four Spaniards, a Japanese, a Canadian and a Belgian.
The nationalities of the other five passengers were not known.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, which is usually a one-hour trip, was seized about
30 minutes after it took off and just as the plane crossed into
Indian airspace.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers, armed with AK-47 rifles and grenades that they
had apparently carried when they boarded in Nepal, first ordered
the pilot fly to Lahore, Pakistan. After Pakistani authorities
denied them permission to land, the plane was allowed to land in
nearby Amritsar, in northwestern India, because it was running low
on fuel, with 20 minutes of flying time remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In Amritsar, the hijackers appeared to panic after having warned
authorities that they would begin killing passengers if anyone
tried to approach the plane except to refuel it. Airport officials
said the gunmen opened fire while the aircraft was on the ground
and then, without waiting for refueling, ordered the pilot to take
off.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said later that the pilot reported to air
controllers that the hijackers had told him that they had killed
four people and had injured several others.
</P>
<P>
   The plane again turned toward Lahore, sinking to an altitude of
just 500 feet before Pakistani officials finally agreed to let it
make an emergency landing on a darkened runway.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan had already sent army commandos to patrol the airport,
although officials tried hard to avoid having anything to do with
the plane. The airport manager, Ghulam Mustafa Mirani, told the
Agence France-Presse that the runway lights had been switched off
to prevent the plane from landing. Only when the plane was
dangerously close to a crash landing, Mirani said, did authorities
relent.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Islamabad said
permission was granted on humanitarian grounds after the pilot
reported that he was almost out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In Lahore, the hijackers demanded fuel and food but apparently
did not speak directly to officials. A spokesman for the
government, General Rashid Qureshi, said the hijackers made their
demands through the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   After 2 1-2 hours in Lahore, the plane again took off without
releasing any people. The gunmen ordered the pilot to fly to
Afghanistan, the authorities said. But it was again denied landing
permission.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan Islamic Press, in a report from the southern Afghan
city of Kandahar monitored by the British broadcasters, said the
civil aviation minister of the Taliban, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor,
refused a request to land at Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known why the Afghans, who have close relations with
Pakistan, refused. In any case, press reports from the region said
the Kabul airport, badly damaged in years of war and civil strife,
does not have operating radar that would assist a pilot in making a
night landing.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts speculated that the hijacking could be linked
to the disputed territory of Kashmir, the object of a long and
bitter struggle between India and Pakistan that heated up into a
military confrontation this year.

MCCAIN'S UNMATCHED AVAILABILITY YIELDS GOOD RELATIONS WITH PRESS
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to change `and' to `or' in 9th graf.) 
(mk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ No one could accuse John McCain of shirking
his obligations to the newspaper readers of Norway. For 30 minutes
of his precious campaign time the other day, the senator from
Arizona took questions from a reporter from Oslo as the two sat in
the back of the bus that his staff has christened the Straight Talk
Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really appreciate being on the bus with you,'' Anne
Thurmann-Nielsen, correspondent for the Norwegian daily Dagbladet,
said as the exchange wound down.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate winked. ``Well, we do feel the critical vote in
this campaign will be out in Minnesota,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other journalists on the bus, representing news
organizations as diverse as ABC News and The Arizona Daily Star of
Tucson, laughed at the senator's allusion to the Midwestern state's
large population of Scandinavian-Americans. But in his wry
acknowledgement that this encounter was unlikely to help him win a
single vote, McCain was actually telling a joke on himself, one
that everyone on the bus was in on: These days, he never meets an
interviewer he doesn't like.
</P>
<P>
   Among political reporters, the extraordinary access that McCain
provides has become the stuff of instant legend, and it is not only
the Norwegian media that has benefited. Opportunities for face time
with the other major candidates tend to be limited and fiercely
regimented. ``I was on the campaign with Gore, but he was on the
other bus,'' Ms. Thurmann-Nielsen said of her inability to get
close to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for hour after hour, McCain takes on all comers on the
Straight Talk Express as it crosses early primary states like New
Hampshire and South Carolina. In fact, this maverick Republican
conservative will spar and ruminate, banter and cajole, kick back
and hold forth for as long as anyone with a pad or a microphone
cares. And sometimes, even longer.
</P>
<P>
   The result: an unusually tension-free relationship between the
press and a candidate from a wing of a party that has often viewed
journalists as the enemy. Indeed, some in the conservative movement
are so deeply resentful of McCain's clubbiness with the press and
incredulous at the huge amount of attention he has garnered _
earlier this month, for instance, Time ran his photo on the cover
and a package of five stories on his candidacy _ that they detect a
strong whiff of favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much like the boomlet for Colin Powell,'' declared Tim
Graham, director of media analysis for the Media Research Center, a
conservative think tank. ``There is the hero part, and they're
liking this guy because he's fun, he's very candid. To me, it's
disturbing that the biggest test for deciding who's presidential
timber is which candidate is the fastest returning your phone
call.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham reported in the weekly press release that the center
calls its ``Media Reality Check'' that between Sept. 27 and Dec.
10, McCain, his wife, Cindy, or his campaign manager appeared on
``Good Morning America'' eight times, or once ``every nine days.''
During the same period, he said, the other Republican candidates
were on once or never.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters dismiss the idea that a ride on the Straight Talk
Express means a free ride for the candidate. But they sure do like
the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unique,'' said Joe Klein, political writer for The New
Yorker and author of the Clinton-years novel ``Primary Colors,'' as
he rode the bus from Cambridge, Mass., to this historic seafaring
city on New Hampshire's tiny coastline. ``Most politicians, even at
this stage, don't give the level of access that he's giving now.''
</P>
<P>
   And reporters suspect that any minute, they and the senator will
awake from this dream, and the candidate will trade in his plush
recliner in the back of the bus for the enveloping cocoon of his
strategists and media consultants at the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long can you keep this up, the letting us grill you for
hours?'' Dana Millbank, a New Republic writer, asked the senator
one evening on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, McCain replied. ``This is one thing I can't
change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the race, McCain's staff tried their best to change
him, to get him to follow the unwritten political commandment that
says, Thou shalt not be too available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trained to parcel out access, to vet every
question,'' said John Weaver, the campaign's political director.
``But he refused, and finally we just surrendered. And you know, he
was right. Not every candidate can do this, but what we've
discovered is, so what if he makes a mistake? The interesting thing
is that the more the press sees the candidate is a real person, the
more likely they'll be to give him a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and other aides to McCain say that reporters may find the
candidate appealing for the same reasons as the public. He is a
charismatic speaker and a natural object of admiration, having
emerged from five and a half years in a North Vietnamese prison
with his sense of humor intact. But even if some reporters say they
do like him, it is for the most part an attraction born of
pragmatism. ``He's good copy, and he returns my phone calls,'' said
one veteran Washington correspondent.

</P>
<P>
   Klein, who pointed out that this is the seventh New Hampshire
presidential primary he has covered, acknowledged that the question
of how much extra slack reporters may cut McCain is a tough one.
The potentially damaging episodes of the senator's past _ his
involvement in the Keating Five affair, the reports of his angry
outbursts _ have been widely reported. But would the reporters pull
out their cell phones if a gaffe were committed on the Straight
Talk Express? Klein said he might not, but not because of his
feelings about McCain. ``I have a `no gotcha' rule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The romance of the sharp-tongued McCain and a demanding press
corps is, of course, more complex than it appears.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case with veteran lawmakers, he and his hometown
paper, The Arizona Republic of Phoenix, have feuded off and on,
over such issues as the content of its editorial cartoons and his
reputation for being quick to anger. ``It's never been a good
relationship,'' the senator said. And the campaign acknowledged
misstepping when it tried recently to control a sensitive story,
the release of McCain's medical records, by giving it early to
selected reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Salkowski, a technology reporter for the Tucson paper who
traveled with the candidate for several days last week, said that
while he found the senator ``good to deal with _ he'll return my
calls,'' some of his Arizona colleagues found him mercurial. ``The
perception is, he is more difficult to deal with than his national
reputation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Straight Talk Express, however, the atmosphere of all
candor all the time bathes the campaign in a nonconfrontational
informality. The bus design itself contributes to the feeling. It
is more Winnebago than standard-issue charter, with kitchen and
shower and couches built into the walls. McCain genuinely seems to
like reporters; he not only knows their names, he reads their
stories. He talks politics and policy but also boxing and books and
history and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I do it is because I enjoy it,'' he said
one afternoon, as the bus descended from the White Mountains on the
way to Manchester. ``Some of the smartest people I've ever met are
in the media, and some of the dumbest people I've ever met are in
the media.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about an insatiable appetite for spectator sports _
``I would watch guys picking up refrigerators,'' was how he put it
_ and an aversion to being ``handled,'' saying, ``I won't take
security: I don't need it, I don't like it, I don't want it.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered innocuous quips about well-known politicians and
praise for the press for its hands-off treatment of Chelsea
Clinton, and when asked about it afterward by Salkowski, a mea
culpa for overstating his legislative achievements in an interview
with a radio reporter. ``That was a bit disingenuous,'' he
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters are taken aback by all the attention. A look of
something like shock comes over the faces of some newcomers to the
Straight Talk Express as it dawns on them that this candidate
actually wants to sit next to them. The thought is expressed by
some professional skeptics _ reporters, pundits and politicians _
that it is a ploy, that the guarantee of access translates to
better coverage, and that this partly accounts for McCain's growing
popularity with the voters here.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, for one, thinks not. ``It's not us,'' he said, referring
to McCain's surge in various polls in New Hampshire. ``If it were
us, Bruce Babbitt would have been elected president. There's always
a press favorite in a campaign, and it's usually the loser.''

DEPARTING CHIEF SAYS KODAK IS NOW BETTER FOCUSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to change 2,000 to 20,000 in 14th graf, bgng Fisher
believes...) 
(mk) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Maybe George M.C. Fisher should feel pretty
glum right about now.
</P>
<P>
   This is the man, after all, who in 1993 was hailed as the
Eastman Kodak Co.'s shining star. Fresh from a successful stint as
Motorola's chief, he was expected to steer Kodak from the
frightened old-style photography company it had become into a
robust, hugely profitable player in the digital imaging age.
</P>
<P>
   Those first few years, it seemed all systems were go. Fisher was
an absolute hero in Rochester, a city whose economic fortunes and
self-image have long been tied to Kodak. Strangers would greet him
in restaurants and markets, the local news media recorded his every
move, and the national press _ along with numerous consultants and
professors _ placed him with John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric
and Lawrence A. Bossidy of AlliedSignal among the premier
management movers of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher never fulfilled that promise at Kodak. When Daniel A.
Carp, a 29-year Kodak employee who has long been Fisher's heir
apparent, officially accepts the chief executive's post on Jan. 1 _
a year before Fisher's contract officially runs out on Dec. 31,
2000 _ he will inherit a company that measures the performance of
its digital portfolio in reduced losses, not stellar profits.
</P>
<P>
   Its mainstay business, conventional photography, is under
competitive siege from Fuji Photo Film of Japan. And even though
the Japanese yen has risen in value, making Kodak more competitive
against Fuji, the continued strength of the dollar against most
other currencies keeps eating away at its overseas profits.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Kodak's share price is mired; its stock topped $80
a couple of times during Fisher's tenure, but always dropped
precipitously again. Kodak shares closed at $63.4375 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When Kodak announced the succession in June, many analysts
speculated that Fisher had been pushed by a fed-up board to
relinquish the helm earlier than he had planned. Fisher, who is 60,
insists the succession plan is on schedule, and any suggestion
otherwise is enough to send sparks flying from his generally calm
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed longer than I intended to, and I really get angry at
innuendos that the board booted me out, or that Dan staged a palace
coup,'' said Fisher, who will remain Kodak's chairman until the end
of 2000. ``I should be getting high marks for managing a succession
plan that was smooth as ice, yet everyone is looking for subplots.
The fact is, some board members just didn't want me to leave,
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a recent conversation in his Rochester offices, as a
bright winter sun bathed his face _ ``I'm a child of the sun, I'll
take the window side in a plane just to enjoy the glare,'' he said
with a laugh _ Fisher seemed anything but shaken or contrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never believed the hype about me going in, and I don't
believe the bad things people say now,'' he said. ``I never
deserved to be put on a pedestal, but I also didn't deserve to be
knocked off it so inappropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   As Fisher tells it, when he was persuaded by Roberto C.
Goizueta, then chief executive of Coca-Cola and a Kodak board
member, to take Kodak's top job in 1993, the company was a mess.
</P>
<P>
   It was mired in debt. It had haphazardly diversified into
pharmaceuticals and other areas it knew little about. Its growth,
save the revenues it added on with ill-starred acquisitions, was
flat. It was a high-cost manufacturer, with a bloated staff and a
sleepy culture that was slow to make decisions. And it regarded
digital photography as the enemy, an evil juggernaut that would
kill the chemical-based film and paper business that had fueled
Kodak's sales and profits for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great American icon that was going the wrong way,
fast,'' Fisher said. ``Roberto said, `You've got to do this for God
and America, you've got to get it directed into the next century,
to make Kodak's own people understand that this company has a
future.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher believes he has done just that. He notes that today,
Kodak is focused on pictures, nothing else. It is nearly 20,000
jobs lighter, and a lot nimbler, thanks in part to a set of
culture-changing incentives that reward managers for fast decisions
and even faster execution. Roughly a third of its senior managers
are new in their jobs; the board includes many more outsiders. And
the company has a huge presence in China and other emerging
markets, where most experts think consumer use of cameras is poised
to explode.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this year, Kodak started growing again, with sales up
about 5 percent. Its per-share earnings are rising, while its debt
is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak also has a new ``digitization strategy'' for using digital
technology to enhance, not replace, conventional film. Through
Internet partnerships that let customers receive electronic
versions of their photos by e-mail, through kiosks that let them
manipulate and reproduce old photographs, and through archival
services that let users store their photographs on CD-ROMs or on
the Internet, Kodak has managed not only to salvage its profitable
chemical-based photography business, it has added a technological
veneer to it.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fisher is ready to say goodbye. He has already sold his
Rochester home, a 15-room house on 15 acres that Fisher, an avid
horticulturist, said has the most beautiful trees of any place he
has lived in. He and his wife, Ann, will move into a small
apartment after the sale closes in March, but come 2001, it will be
goodbye to Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I feel sad, I loved that house, and I'll miss many Kodak
people, but I always knew I'd leave town when the job at Kodak was
over,'' Fisher said. ``It would have been too difficult to stay on
after being head of Kodak, you become such an icon.''

</P>
<P>
   Following are other excerpts from a nearly three-hour
reminiscence session:
</P>
<P>
   Q. There are those who view your tenure at Kodak as a terrible
disappointment. Do you feel you've failed?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not at all. I remember telling Roberto it would take three
years to get Kodak on track. He said it would take five, and OK,
it's taken closer to seven. But the fact is, I've accomplished
everything I set out to do. I get angry when I get mail from people
complaining about my performance, or when members of the press
select the quotes they use to paint negative stories. We're going
to have the best financial year in the history of the company, and
a lot of analysts do have buy ratings on Kodak stock these days.
</P>
<P>
   I got Kodak pointed in the right direction, and if the new team
gets all the credit for that, well, Godspeed to them. Smart people
will recognize that I laid the fundamentals. When you write the
history of these last six years, you'll find that one of my
greatest contributions was changing the culture here.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But it was supposed to be turning Kodak into a digital-profit
machine.
</P>
<P>
   A. In 1993 no one, not even Bill Gates, understood the impact of
the Internet. Still, if you'd asked me then how big Kodak's digital
business would be by now, I'd have said two, maybe $3 billion.
Well, it's $2.3 billion this year. Maybe my real failure is that I
haven't communicated how powerful our digitization strategy really
is.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But you are losing $100 million a year in digital, and
shareholders are clearly unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   A. You call it losses, I call it investment. If this were a
stand-alone start-up company, I'd be a hero on Wall Street. I'm
growing the business 40 percent a year, and if I were losing $100
million as a start-up, investors would say `big deal.'
</P>
<P>
   There are 117 dot-com companies out there who keep saying
they'll eat Kodak and Fuji up. It amazes me how many smart people
believe such stupid statements. I wish I could get investors to sit
down and ask good questions, but some people are just too stupid.
</P>
<P>
   I remember a time when Motorola's stock was down, and Bob
Galvin, the chairman, asked me three things. Will I sell my
Motorola stock? I said no, of course not. Am I doing the right
things? I said yes. Am I doing the right things in the right way? I
said yes again. He said, the stock price will take care of itself.
It did there, and it will here.
</P>
<P>
   Q. As you look back over the last six years, are there memories
that make you wince?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nineteen ninety-seven was my year from hell. Everything went
wrong. We lost the World Trade Organization decision; the currency
went south; the health organizations got aggressive in purchasing
medical films; our CD-ROM prices collapsed; our leading film
competitor got aggressive in pricing. Even our race car started
losing all its races! There were days I wondered whether there was
some gravitational field from the outer universe impinging on us. I
never doubted myself, but there were times I wondered if I could
handle one more piece of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   I had no choice but to promise we'd take $1 billion out of
costs. And that meant cutting jobs. I'm a nice person, a good
person; I don't like hurting people. I'd spent my first few years
traveling all around Kodak, and I knew these people personally.
These were people who really trusted me, put their faith in me.
Cutting all those jobs, all at once and in such a harsh way, was
one of the most painful things I've done in my life.
</P>
<P>
   Q. More painful than knowing that many people think that you,
too, were thrown out of your job against your will?
</P>
<P>
   A. The main problem seems to be the perception of the press. The
press doesn't understand how companies run. And yes, I was really
caught off guard, and very hurt, by the negative perceptions that
came out in so many articles when the succession was announced. I'm
always surprised by the underlining meanness, about the selectivity
of the quotes, about how the media will latch onto the neatest
sound bite. In hindsight I guess I was naive. But I have the
confidence of my brain, of knowing I can think and move in real
time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are you going to do now?
</P>
<P>
   A. I get called quite frequently from high-tech start-ups
looking for a chief. And I've sent signals out that I'd like to do
some teaching, so the calls are starting to come in from
universities. Right now I have the notion that I'd like to teach
technology in an engineering school, although I may come to my
senses before I take that plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Q. None of those jobs are likely to yield the celebrity status
you've enjoyed in Rochester. Will you miss the attention, and the
perks and prestige of being a corporate chief?
</P>
<P>
   A. Being Kodak's CEO in Rochester is an unreal existence. In
Chicago, when I ran Motorola, I could be hit by a truck and no one
would notice. Here, if I sneeze, it's written about. It's not
always an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   I've never personalized the reasons I was getting in so many
doors; it was the job, not me. If I miss the perks, well, I've been
financially lucky enough so that I can provide them for myself. If
I miss having a corporate plane, I'll buy a plane.
</P>
<P>
   This business about being among the great CEOs of all time,
that's something you folks in the press worry about, not me. My ego
is under control. I don't run my life by what people think about
me. I want people to like me, sure, but I hope over the next 40
years to do many more significant things. And if the press doesn't
recognize those either, so be it.

EDITORIAL: SOFT MONEY'S STAYING POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., La., Fla., Mass. Mo., Pa.) (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 25:
</P>
<P>
   The political parties have absorbed exactly the wrong message
from the 1996 Clinton fund-raising scandals. Instead of steering
clear of schemes to subvert federal limits on campaign
fund-raising, party officials seem determined to keep raising huge
chunks of unregulated soft money to pay for candidates' television
ads.
</P>
<P>
   A story in Wednesday's Times reported that Democratic Party
officials have established fund-raising committees in several
states with hot Senate contests. These new state-level ``victory
funds'' will allow donors barred by federal law from contributing
more than $2,000 per election cycle directly to an individual
candidate to write a $100,000 check to a party account. The
candidates themselves will help raise the money with the tacit
understanding that a hefty portion of the funds will be used for
their television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme relies on two fictions _ that the money is meant as a
contribution to the party, not to a specific campaign, and that the
ads are generic ``issue ads'' rather than commercials designed,
sometimes in consultation with a campaign, to help a particular
candidate. The New York State Democratic Party has started running
television ads financed mostly with unregulated ``soft money'' to
promote Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate candidacy. Mrs. Clinton has
not ruled out running more such ads, and there are also Democratic
``victory funds'' up and running to help candidates in California,
Florida, Louisiana and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
officials say they are merely copying the Republicans, who
pioneered this type of fund-raising committee two years ago. The
Republicans have set up two such funds this year, for Senate
candidates in Missouri and Pennsylvania. ``We're learning from
them,'' say David DiMartino, a Democratic Senate committee
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   This escalation in the special-interest money game by both
parties is the price the nation is paying for the indifference
displayed by Attorney General Janet Reno and the Federal Elections
Commission in the last presidential election cycle. Both failed
completely to enforce existing contribution and spending limits
when the Clinton and Dole presidential campaigns made their
end-runs four years ago. As a result, the country again faces the
possibility of new scandals involving big money from tainted
sources.

 `Mayor of Jungletown' made Christmas special for vagabonds  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   CARTHAGE, Mo. _ Christmas, for George
Stump Sr., was always the best of times.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, millions have shared Stump's sentiment _ the
decorated tree, children's expectant faces, the good cheer, the
fulsome meal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what Stump saw at Christmas was different. His attention was
drawn to the bums, vagabonds, vagrants, tramps, knights of the
road, itinerants, hobos and bindlestiffs.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade from the early 1930s and into World War II _ days
far darker than anything that exists today _ Stump ministered to
the cold, bedraggled, hungry and discouraged in a place nicknamed
``Jungletown'' on the north edge of this Jasper County town.
</P>
<P>
   His method? Mulligan stew.
</P>
<P>
   Plus celery, radishes and pickles, Irish potatoes, carrots,
tomatoes, onions, lima beans, oranges, cakes, coffee and milk.
</P>
<P>
   No booze. That was out. But after those dinners and since it was
a time when people weren't wound as tightly as they are now, there
were smokes.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning tailormades. For the road weary, a Lucky or Chesterfield
was like manna.
</P>
<P>
   We know about Stump, dead since 1959, because his granddaughter,
Rebecca Stump Schneider of Kansas City, Kan., was rummaging through
the effects of her father, George Stump Jr., after he died earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   George Stump Jr., incidentally, was a legend in Kansas City
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Among her father's papers, Schneider found a neatly typed,
untitled narrative written by her grandfather on how he became a
benefactor to the downtrodden and received the st ``Mayor of
Jungletown.'' The story began: ``I am just a small town printer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stump worked for the Carthage Morning Democrat. A printer then
was the indispensable performer in communications, meaning
newspapers. Reporters and editors were a dime or less a dozen; a
printer was the keystone who got the paper out.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, many printers, as Stump's narrative showed, wrote clearly
and well. Set enough type and the craft rubs off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, Stump was fairly secure. He had a job, a comfortable
home, and food on the table for his family. He had a good brier
pipe and a Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Stump was troubled, especially at Christmas. He would write:
``It seems to me as time rocks along the real spirit and the
holiness of Christmas...has been brushed aside and the marts of
trade are packed with gaudy gadgets and tinsel whose only meaning
is to relieve you of the few pieces of silver you possess.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more, especially as the Depression deepened. Legions
of Americans _ mostly men and teen-age boys but with a smattering
of women and girls _ roamed the land.
</P>
<P>
   What conveyed them were not the interstates or an old Chevy
Malibu _ both still far in the future _ but the railroads. Two
lines, the Frisco and the Missouri Pacific, converged at Carthage,
and the wanderers' way station here was a cut in what was called
Tiger Hill alongside the Spring River.
</P>
<P>
   That cut, under the old U.S. 71 viaduct and still visible, was
this town's ``Hobo Jungle,'' a place where the dispossessed could
fan out and look for the peculiar ideographs that told them ``This
is a place for a handout'' (circle with an X inside); ``Owner will
give food to get rid of you'' (two rectangles); or ``Good-hearted
woman, tell a moving story (a stick figure and a series of tepees).
</P>
<P>
   So Stump knew of the tramps. They rode in on the freight trains.
Some wandered around town, looking for work or handouts. They were
down by the river. He decided to do something about them.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Christmas 1934, Stump bought 10 pounds of boiling
beef plus some vegetables, enlisted the aid of a police officer,
and went to Jungletown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we drove up and the forlorn figures huddled around a
half-hearted fire saw a policeman's uniform their hearts sank and
only sullen stares were our greeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when he explained the purpose of our visit the effect was
like the bursting of glorious sun rays through a rift in the storm
clouds....All pitched in with willing hands. Some started to rustle
wood, others for fresh water, and others peeled potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One poor old fellow could scarcely believe it and seemed on
the verge of tears as he kept muttering, `Tell me there ain't no
Santa Claus.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That first batch of mulligan stew, Stump wrote, gave him more
real joy than anything he had ever done. A verse from St. Paul kept
running through his head: ``Be not forgetful to entertain
strangers, for some have entertained angels unawares.''
</P>
<P>
   Stump had turkey and the fixings awaiting him at home, but he
stayed and ate.
</P>
<P>
   Eight were at that first dinner. It grew, over the next few
years to as many as 50. Grain doors from boxcars doubled as tables.
The hobos took pride in setting a neat table. Empty tomato cans
holding celery stalks formed the floral settings.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph taken during one of the dinners showed holiday
signs above a table piled with food; seven men and two women
standing ready to serve; off to one side a man in a dark overcoat
sucking on a pipe _ Stump himself.
</P>
<P>
   Stump wrote later that as the years passed, he started to see
familiar faces. The dinner, he said, had become a homecoming event
of sorts for the drifting, rootless souls who rode the rails. Some
made sure they were in southwest Missouri for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were the railroads unsympathetic to Stump's endeavor. One of
his traditions was to print a menu _ just like the hotels in the
big cities did _ and send it around. On the back was printed the
arrival and departure of freights, ``so that my guests might make
proper connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Stump's granddaughter, Rebecca Schneider, remembers a story that
came later. After World War II, the family learned that two alumni
of the Christmas dinners found themselves under fire on a
battlefield in wintertime Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled together in a foxhole, the soldiers discovered that
years before they'd had mulligan stew in Carthage at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   As the bullets snapped overhead, one G.I. muttered, ``I sure
wish we was back in Jungletown now.''
</P>
<P>
   The other just nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Van Gilder, a local historian, said that the memory of
Jungletown and Stump has all but faded from Carthage. U.S. 71 has
been relocated and the old highway is lightly traveled.
</P>
<P>
   The grain door tables are long gone. So are the celery stalks in
the tomato cans and the simple decorations. Below is just the river
and the railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Once, though, the less fortunate gathered underneath the viaduct
and celebrated the birth of a child in a faraway land. Stump, being
a printer, put it simply:
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas has always been the greatest day of the year ever
since those three wise old boys headed across the desert on their
slow motion camels toward the little town of Bethlehem with nuthin'
but a star as a stop and go sign.''
