SECOND SET OF FOOD-HANDLING VIOLATIONS FOUND AT SAFECO FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The same day the general manager of Safeco Field's
food vendor promised that food-handling problems ``won't happen
again,'' public health officials found an even greater number of
serious food safety violations.
</P>
<P>
   Public health inspectors identified 26 ``red critical''
violations at the Seattle Mariners' new stadium upon re-inspection
Thursday of concession stands and kiosks operated or managed by
Volume Services America Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unacceptable,'' said Dr. Alonzo Plough, director of
Public Health-Seattle &AMP; King County. ``We will not allow this to
become a chronic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Alton Hutcheson, general manager of Volume Services America,
Inc., told the media Thursday that problems had been corrected at
Safeco Field and wouldn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Hutcheson did not return telephone calls Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Elaine Richner, spokeswoman for Volume Services'
headquarters in Spartanburg, S.C., again emphasized that her
company was doing everything possible to improve food safety at
Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Volume Services hired a food safety expert yesterday, Richner
said, who will oversee all food services at the Mariners' new
stadium. ``And all the food workers will receive additional
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Hale, spokeswoman for the Mariners, said the baseball
organization has also hired a person to monitor Volume Services on
health-code compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're surprised and very disappointed by this,'' Hale said.
The Mariners have been working with Volume Services and the health
department to prevent a ``third strike'' on food safety for the
homestand that begins Friday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, food inspectors with Public Health-Seattle &AMP; King
County cited 24 of Safeco Field's 55 concession stands and 38
kiosks with ``red critical'' violations. Such violations require
immediate action to prevent the spread of foodborne illnesses such
as E. coli, salmonella or hepatitis A.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, government officials took action to correct similar
problems at the Kingdome when it was revealed that the Dome's food
vendor, Ogden Entertainment, had been cited with 158 red critical
violations over a three-year period. Volume Services at Safeco
Field has acquired 50 such violations in the space of one week.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Ogden recently announced plans to acquire Volume
Services.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the 26 violations identified Thursday at Safeco Field
were in stands or kiosks that already had been cited Monday. The
health department operates a ``three strikes and you're out''
policy in food safety, and will temporarily close down vendors who
violate the rule within a year's time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the red critical violations found among food
handlers inside the Mariners' stadium Thursday, food inspectors
temporarily closed down two outdoor food carts for lack of
hand-washing facilities. One concession stand's improperly prepared
food was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volume Services America and the Mariners must resolve these
problems immediately,'' Plough said, or else the department ``will
take all necessary actions in order to protect the public health.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners on Friday issued a detailed plan in response to the
second round of food safety violations aimed at achieving 100
percent compliance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Volume Services hiring a full-time food safety
expert, and the Mariners' promise to assign someone to oversee
Volume Services, the Mariners announced that all food workers will
be required to complete a more ``stringent and comprehensive food
safety program'' before the next homestand begins.
</P>
<P>
   The program is called ServSafe and is offered by the National
Restaurant Association, Richner said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what kind of training the food workers had received before
working at Safeco Field, Volume Services' Richner said she wasn't
certain but everyone had at least received the minimum training
required to be certified by the health department.

PREDICTIONS OF CARNAGE MISS THEIR MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent Cato Institute analysis of higher speed limits brought
more bad news for nanny-state advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the research reveal how motoring has become safer
by almost every measure, but also estimated the net economic
benefit of repealing the federal speed-limit law at between $2
billion and $3 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which bases many of its findings on data from the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and National Safety
Council, was written by Stephen Moore, Cato's director of fiscal
policy studies.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress repealed the 55-mph federal speed limit, the
president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety predicted on
national television that it would result in 6,400 more deaths a
year and millions more injuries. Ralph Nader predicted ``history
will never forgive Congress for this assault on the sanctity of
human life.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, what Congress really assaulted was the claim that
speed kills, which has never been validated by either real-life
experience or scientific inquiry. It also assaulted a law most
motorists openly flouted with the unspoken cooperation of many in
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years after repeal of the ``double nickel,'' the Cato
study notes, the traffic death rate dropped to a record low level.
As for road injuries, there were 66,000 fewer in 1997 than in 1995,
and the injury rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled dropped
to the lowest rate ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the injury rate had been as high in 1997 as it had been in
1995,'' Moore said, ``approximately 17,000 more Americans would
have been injured on roads.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cato study echoed earlier such analyses showing how higher
speed limits had failed to produce the carnage opponents had
predicted. Such good news usually has been met with claims that the
explanation lies in improved vehicle safety features and better
roads instead of anything having to do with speed limits. Thus,
advocates of the 55-mph limit argue, the results would have been
even better if speed limits hadn't been increased.
</P>
<P>
   The Cato study controlled for other safety factors, however, by
taking into account the number of crashes. While crashes did
increase by 65,000 from 1995 to 1997, crashes nevertheless fell as
a percentage of miles traveled. Also, Moore said, pedestrian
fatalities declined, which indicates that motorists aren't driving
more recklessly as a result of higher speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   Proof that the latest findings aren't an anomaly, Moore said, is
that fatalities and injuries also declined as a percentage of miles
traveled after the federal government eased speed-limit
restrictions on some interstates in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Another prediction that failed to materialize was the $20
billion in extra costs to taxpayers and insurance policyholders
that were forecast to result from more accidents, injuries and
deaths. As it turned out, both claims and insurance premiums began
declining, which reversed a decade-long trend.
</P>
<P>
   Are those who predicted more death and suffering happy they were
wrong? Not so you can tell. When the person who predicted 6,400
more deaths was asked about the missed forecast, her reply was,
``We didn't say it was going to happen overnight.''

<P>
   King Hassan II, who ruled Morocco for 38 years, prolonging the
life of a 300-year-old dynasty in an era when monarchies in Libya,
Egypt, Iraq and Iran fell to Socialist revolutions or the force of
militant Islam, died Friday in Rabat, Morocco. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, Crown Prince Sidi
Mohammed, the king's 36-year-old son and successor, announced on
state television. The king, who had been in fragile health since he
was hospitalized in the United States four years ago for lung
problems, had been admitted earlier in the day to the Avicenne
hospital Rabat, the capital, for an acute lung infection, according
to a statement issued by the palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I announce to the Arab and Islamic nations and to the whole
world the death of a great leader and a man of this world's great
men,'' the crown prince said in a brief message on state television
in which he asked the Moroccan people for ``calm and patience.''
Moroccan television said that his funeral would be held on
Sunday. &UR;  &LR; The White House said that President Clinton planned to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies considered Hassan one of the
most Western-oriented of Arab leaders, a ruler who outmaneuvered
Islamic militants in his own country and who stood out among his
peers for his openness to rapprochement with Israel. Through the
years he acted as a go-between in Middle East diplomacy, helping to
arrange a visit to Jerusalem in 1977 by Egypt's leader, Anwar
Sadat, and, during the 1980s, meeting with the Israeli leaders
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres when other Arabs shunned them.
</P>
<P>
   A master at managing Morocco's complex quilt of ethnic and
ideological forces, he maintained a hold on power that was by turns
iron-fisted and deftly offhand. He survived half a dozen
assassination attempts and uprisings. On one occasion, he
intimidated the leader of rebel troops by looking him in the eye
and reciting the first verse of the Koran. Another time, when
pilots of his own air force attacked his Boeing 727 jetliner, the
king, himself a pilot, seized the radio and shouted, ``Stop firing,
the tyrant is dead,'' fooling the rebels into breaking off their
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The heir to the Alawite dynasty that claimed direct descent from
the Prophet Mohammed and ruled the Sharifian empire of the Western
Sahara, Hassan II was the author of Morocco's first constitution.
But he was at heart an autocrat, and democracy waxed and waned at
his pleasure. He tolerated opposition parties and a relatively free
press that could offer opinions on policy matters. But criticism of
the monarchy was forbidden and his ruthlessness in crushing
opponents was severely criticized by human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Economic and political reform proceeded steadily through his
years in power, and though the pace was slower than his critics
would have liked, said William Zartman, director of African Studies
at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, many would agree that the
country was better off during the final years of his reign than it
was when he first came to power.
</P>
<P>
   His success lay in an ability to be different things to
different people. He kept Morocco's elite content with royal
patronage and instituted market-oriented reforms that improved the
lives of the urban middle class. He used his position as
``Commander of the Faithful'' to woo the rural peasantry,
quadrupled the number of mosques and constructed the world's
largest, the Great Mosque of Hassan the II.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had deep understanding from the early days of the tribal
mentality of Morocco and the importance of the throne as a unifying
force,'' said Robert H. Pelletreau, a former assistant secretary of
state for near eastern affairs, who knew the king well. ``He was a
superb student, and he could be exceedingly charming.''
</P>
<P>
   Moroccans said of Hassan that he had ``baraka,'' or
``blessedness, '' an Arabic expression for a charismatic person
blessed with divine protection. Yet, when he ascended the throne on
Feb. 26, 1961, most observers expected him to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Moulay Hassan ben Mohammed Alaoui was born on July 9, 1929, the
oldest of six children of Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef. Most of
Morocco was then a protectorate of France, except for sections
governed by Spain in the northwest and southern coast and the city
of Tangier, an international zone.
</P>
<P>
   As World War II unfolded, resistance to colonial rule grew.
After the fall of France, the Free-French forces promised
independence if Morocco would cooperate in the war against the
Axis, a promise that Paris would prove unwilling to keep.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, tension rose between the sultan and the French,
but the young prince was educated as befitted the heir of two
traditions. He attended the imperial college at Rabat, where
instruction was in Arabic and French. Later, he earned a law degree
from the University of Bordeaux and served in the French navy
aboard the battleship Jeanne d'Arc.
</P>
<P>
   But his father's agitation for Moroccan self-government
continued, and in 1953 the French forced the sultan into exile. In
1954 and 1955, as rioting and guerrilla warfare increased, Hassan's
father regained his title, and the following year Morocco won
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan worked with his father, now Mohammed V, to maintain the
monarchy's authority amid rising social discontent and the
conflicting expectations of those who had fought for Moroccan
independence. In 1957, he became the commander in chief of the
Moroccan army, which was splintered between officers who had been
loyal to the French and the former rebels. Hassan kept the military
occupied with civilian projects, and led it to victory against
rebel Berber tribesmen in the Rif mountains in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   But in the shantytowns of Rabat, Casablanca and other cities,
opposition simmered against the royal house. Though the monarchy
looked to Paris and Washington for financial support, it needed to
placate the leftist opposition. Declaring neutrality in the Cold
War, the prince made overtures to Moscow and accepted Soviet
military aid. ``As an Islamic People,'' he told the Associated
Press in 1961, ``we have the right to practice bigamy. We can wed
East and West and be faithful to both.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments caused consternation in Western capitals. So did
the reputation of the young prince, who the Western press often
portrayed as a playboy who liked gambling and was overly concerned
with his wardrobe.

HUNDREDS CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF MOVIE THEATER MOGUL DURWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ It was a showman's dream, brimming with
bagpipes and barbecue, laughter and tears.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the scene at Friday's ``Celebration of an Extraordinary
Life,'' held in memory of movie theater mogul Stanley H. Durwood,
who died of cancer last week at age 78.
</P>
<P>
   About 700 people attended the event at downtown's Midland
Theatre, where Durwood spun many of his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood invented the multiplex movie theater and headed AMC
Entertainment Inc. He has been likened to Louis B. Mayer, Darryl F.
Zanuck and Jack Warner, the giants of the golden age of movies.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's tribute cut a giant swath. Main Street in front of the
Midland was blocked off to traffic and adorned with a large tent
set up for a barbecue lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Marge Grant, Durwood's sister, said Durwood helped plan Friday's
event. ``I want this to be a celebration of my life,'' he told her.
``I want people to come and have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Guests were greeted outside the front door by two bagpipers and
a drummer, sporting kilts and filling the air with venerable
Scottish tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the sweltering lobby, guests listened to live jazz and
drank bottled water while they waited for the tribute to begin in
the ornate theater, a restored palace from the days when downtown
was the place to see a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Words of admiration flowed from city and business leaders, along
with Durwood family members and associates.
</P>
<P>
   The picture they painted was of a man who fought hard and well
on the college football field and in the business arena, a Harvard
alum who demanded the most of himself and his employees.
</P>
<P>
   But they also portrayed a father of six who cherished time with
his family and remembered the birthdays of virtually everyone he
knew, a man of immense wealth who drove a Honda and flew in coach
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good hugger,'' said Amy Heidersbach, a niece of
Durwood's widow, Pamela Durwood.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes characterized Durwood as a
visionary and praised his $454 million Power &AMP; Light District plan
to revive downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although sometimes ahead of his time, his vision is where we
are headed,'' Barnes said. ``In the heart of this city where we're
gathered today, Stan's dream is beginning to unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Nelson, president of Kansas City-area NationsBank
operations, said Durwood had to fight Kansas City's ``reticence and
inferiority complex'' to push his downtown redevelopment plan,
which includes movie theaters, shopping, restaurants, residential
space, parking garages and offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan never gave up, and it will be built,'' Nelson said,
igniting thunderous applause.
</P>
<P>
   Civic leader Anita Gorman compared Durwood to the prophet Moses,
who died just before reaching the promised land. Like Moses, she
said, Durwood now has a better vantage point.
</P>
<P>
   Son Peter Durwood fought back tears as he described going on
bicycle rides as a 10-year-old with his father. He said that
Durwood had the gleeful enthusiasm of a ``big kid'' and that he
liked to organize games among neighborhood children.
</P>
<P>
   Others praised Durwood for taking a family business that
consisted of a few theaters and transforming it into one of the
largest movie exhibition companies in the world. Today it has 218
movie theater complexes with 2,729 screens in 23 states and
Washington, D.C., plus complexes in Canada and overseas. He is
credited with strengthening the entire movie theater industry.
</P>
<P>
   Charles J. Egan Jr., an AMC director and longtime Durwood
friend, said Durwood never shrank from controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working and living with him was not a day at the beach,'' Egan
said. ``One calls to mind Churchill's characterization of De
Gaulle: He was the only bull I know who had his own china shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Durwood was a self-described provocateur, throwing out a
thousand ideas at a time, recalled Philip M. Singleton, president
and chief operating officer of American Multi-Cinema Inc., an AMC
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   And the theater magnate's determination would double if people
scoffed at his ideas, Singleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friend Raymond F. Beagle Jr. said Durwood loved to go
out on Saturday night and mingle with patrons at AMC movie
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an elixir to Stan,'' Beagle said. ``His chest would
swell, and I swear he would grow by a foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan said the Stanley H. Durwood Foundation, a charitable trust,
would take its place among the city's leading foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The event included film clips of Durwood and a recording of
Petula Clark singing ``Downtown,'' which Grant said was Durwood's
favorite song.
</P>
<P>
   Former Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, recalling the
struggles of Durwood's downtown redevelopment efforts, said Durwood
reminded him of a man being chased by a lion.
</P>
<P>
   Running from the lion, the man falls into a pit and looks down
to see a huge python at the bottom. The man then grabs a vine, only
to see a rat gnawing on it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when all seems lost, the man sees some fruit and eats it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the way Stan Durwood handled his crises,'' Cleaver
said. ``He ate the fruit.''

 UNDATED: his wardrobe.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Mohammed V died of heart failure following what was
expected to be a minor operation, Hassan, who had been named prime
minister in 1960, moved quickly to establish his rule. His
constitution, which was ratified in 1962, guaranteed freedom of the
press and of religion, and created an elected legislature. But the
new Parliament, fractured by bitter rivalries, proved ineffectual.
The new king retained the power to name the prime minister, disband
the legislature and control the army.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid 1960s, student agitation led to a wave of rioting and
arrests. Opposition figures fled abroad or were imprisoned; some
were executed. In 1965, Mehdi Ben Barka, a prominent nationalist
and opposition leader, was kidnapped in Paris and never seen again.
The king's right-hand man, Minister of Interior Mohammed Oufkir,
was linked to the disappearance, and there were those who thought
he had killed Ben Barka. But the case was never pressed. In June of
that year, Hassan dissolved Parliament and instituted a state of
emergency, wielding absolute power until a new constitution was
adopted in 1970. The constitution restored limited parliamentary
government, but discontent simmered amid continuing poverty and
official corruption.
</P>
<P>
   On July 10, 1971, Hassan invited some 400 prominent Moroccans,
diplomats, and other guests to his seaside palace of Skhirat near
Rabat to celebrate his 42nd birthday. The festivities ended in a
burst of gunfire as more than 1,000 mutinous troops attacked the
palace, hurling grenades and spraying the grounds with small-arms
fire. Nearly 100 guests were killed, and more than 125 were
wounded. The king hid in a bathroom. When the firing died down he
re-emerged to find himself face to face with one of the rebel
commanders. Keeping eye contact, he recited the opening verse of
the Koran, and the rebel knelt and kissed his hand. Loyal troops
crushed the revolt, killing more than 150 rebels and capturing some
900 others, many of them young military cadets. A dozen
high-ranking, conservative officers were executed. Oufkir was named
minister of defense.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than 12 months later, on Aug. 16, 1972, the king
was returning from Paris aboard his private Boeing 727 when it
encountered an unscheduled escort of four Royal Moroccan Air Force
F-5 fighters. As the Boeing approached Rabat's airport, the
fighters fired on the plane, knocking out an engine and scoring
other hits. The Boeing landed safely, but the renegade pilots
continued to strafe the runway until Hassan radioed them, saying
the king had been killed. The rebels broke off the attack. Within
hours, key participants in the coup were arrested and shot.
</P>
<P>
   One of their leaders proved to be Oufkir, who apparently had
been secretly involved in the earlier attack on the palace.
According to official reports, the general committed suicide, but
his body was supposedly found with several wounds. His widow and
six children were placed under house arrest and were not released
until February 1991, in an amnesty marking the king's 30 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1970s unfolded, the king took several steps to dampen
domestic turmoil. In 1973, he put through measures to increase
Moroccan ownership and employment in companies doing business in
Morocco and also redistributed farmland owned by foreigners to
rural peasants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He alternated very cleverly between the kinds of reforms that
would be popular with the people and the kinds of reforms popular
with the ruling elite and in doing so was popular with both,'' said
Pelletreau.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1975, in a move that would unite Moroccans against a
common foe, Hassan reasserted his country's authority over the
Western Sahara, a region claimed by both Morocco and Mauritania but
was still officially under Spanish administration, by trucking some
350,000 civilians under army escort to the region, where they
staged a march.
</P>
<P>
   The move helped secure Morocco's claim but ignited a war with
guerrillas of the Polisario Front who had been fighting for
independence from Spain. Libya and Algeria supported the guerrillas
in their war against the Moroccan Army. In 1984, the king signed an
accord with Col. Moammar Kadhafi that ended Libyan backing for the
insurgents. Algeria, plagued by its own domestic problems, could
give them only minimal support. Militarily, Morocco eventually
triumphed, agreeing to a cease-fire with Polisario in 1991 that
left the country in control of most the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Polisario Front continues to hang on, but the United Nations
is scheduling a referendum in March to determine the course of the
future of the region's 300,000 people.

   Hassan was adept at managing Arab-Israeli relations and liked to
say that he viewed Morocco's Jewish population, which numbers
around 8,000, as a bridge between Israelis and Arabs. During World
War II, his father, Mohammed V, had defied the Axis and protected
his country's Jewish population. In 1956, the year of Moroccan
independence, there were about 275,000 Jews in Morocco. Most were
allowed to emigrate to Israel, Europe and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   During the Arab-Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973, Hassan
contributed a nominal number of troops to support Egypt and Syria.
Nevertheless, he kept his channels open with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, he was the host of a meeting of Arab leaders in Fez
where he pushed through agreement on a peace plan that called for
the creation of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital
but implicitly recognized Israel's right to exist. Although it was
rejected by Israel, the plan laid the groundwork for the king to
meet with Prime Minister Shimon Peres in 1986. When he was
criticized by Arab leaders for meeting Peres, he assailed them for
having neither the ability to make war on Israel nor the
willingness to make peace.

<P>
   In September 1993, Morocco gave de facto recognition to Israel
by welcoming Yitzhak Rabin in the first official visit by an
Israeli prime minister to an Arab nation other than Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such bold gestures, he was careful to play both sides of
a conflict when necessary. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in
1990, he sent 1,300 troops to Saudi Arabia, a gesture that pleased
the West. But he also expressed sympathy for Iraqis suffering under
U.N. sanctions and ordered members of the Moroccan royal family to
supervise the collection of supplies to ease their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite aid from the West, sporadic reform efforts, and an
estimated $2 billion a year sent home by Moroccans working abroad,
the economic situation during the 1990s remained difficult for most
of Morocco's 25 million people, two-thirds of whom are under the
age of 25. In the census of 1994, the urban population exceeded the
rural population for the first time. Unrest generally declined in
the cities, where most of the economic reforms were concentrated.
Although unemployment remained a problem and the strains of a
relatively slow pace of development continued, political freedom
gradually increased. In the early 1990s, pressure from human rights
groups reduced the number of political prisoners and reports of
incidents of torture declined.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalist parties did well in the most recent election, in
1993. Another election is scheduled in November, in which the lower
house of Parliament will be directly elected for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such moves toward democracy, throughout his reign the
king remained jealous of preserving the symbols of his monarchy. He
refused, for example, to abandon the practice of having his
subjects show their fealty by kissing his hand, even though
advisers urged him to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he donned a business suit to meet with Western leaders,
or appeared in traditional white robes to preside over religious
ceremonies, the King was a leader of commanding presence, an
eloquent orator in Arabic who spoke excellent French and capable
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``His golf outings were the picture of an oriental potentate,''
recalled Pelletreau, the U.S. diplomat. ``He would be accompanied
by a vast entourage. If he wanted to sit, chairs would appear, and
his guests would be offered sherbert.''
</P>
<P>
   Through intelligence, charm and cunning, he steered an absolute
monarchy into the modern world. ``He sheltered Morocco from the
various political winds that blew across the Arab world and caused
such turmoil in other countries.'' Pelletreau said.
</P>
<P>
   The king is survived by his wife, Lalla Latifa, a commoner who
is officially described as the mother of the royal children, three
daughters and two sons, including the crown prince, Sidi Mohammed,
who is to succeed him as to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, the crown prince comes to the throne with the
reputation of a playboy. At 35, he is still single in a society the
emphasizes family ties. He was educated in France, where he
received a degree in law and studied international relations. He
speaks fluent French, Spanish and English as well as Arabic. In
recent years, he has begun to take a more active public role as
second in command of the Moroccan military and in helping to direct
government aid to the poor. Hassan sent the crown prince as his
representative to the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan in
February. With his accession to the throne, his younger brother
Mulai Rashid will become the new crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   Palace officials say the transition will bring no change in key
Moroccan policies, including the longstanding alliance with the
United States and strong support for peace between Israel and its
Arab neighbors. The aides also said Sidi Mohammed would continue
his father's policy of insisting on Moroccan sovereignty over the
disputed territory of the Western Sahara, which Morocco occupied in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the crown prince is expected to take his distance
from some of his father's closest advisers, principally Interior
Minister Driss Basri, who in his 20 years in that post has been
associated with hard-line policies toward domestic opposition from
both the left and the Islamic fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Hassan said recently that Sidi Mohammed was likely to
move hard-liners in his father's entourage aside in effort to
accelerate democratic reforms that his father had initiated in
recent years.

TEENS TRY TO KEEP YOUNG DRIVERS FROM HOPPING HILLS 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ Twice this week, Jordan Miller and a bunch of
his friends descended on Argo Road in rural eastern Jackson County,
Mo., hoping to stop another tragedy from happening this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Eight to 10 teens flagged down cars and encouraged drivers to
cut their speed in memory of two friends killed while ``hill
hopping'' on that road last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who hill hop try to gain speed while climbing a hill so
they become airborne when they reach the crest. The practice
produces a thrill similar to riding a roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go down there just to see if they can break 100,'' said
Miller, 17, of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's 16-year-old friends, Eric L. Wion and Charles E.
Brennam, both of Independence, were killed last Saturday when Wion
lost control of his maroon Ford Probe and hit a utility pole.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have speculated that hill hopping in June caused the
death of Independence teen-ager Mike Motter, who was riding in a
car that also hit a power pole.
</P>
<P>
   Both accidents occurred on a hilly stretch of Argo Road, just
east of Independence and north of Blue Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Wion's mother, Nancy Wion, says she intends to put up a
billboard on Argo Road listing the names of the three dead teens
and asking drivers to think about them before speeding.
</P>
<P>
   She also wants to put the Ford Probe in front of Truman High
School during fall registration as a reminder of what can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dangerous thing, and the kids are drawn to it (hill
hopping),'' Wion said. ``I'd like to see kids think a couple of
times before they go speeding on Argo Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Graham Kempster of the Jackson County Sheriff's Department
said the surviving teen-ager in Saturday's crash, Brennam's younger
brother, had acknowledged that the teen-agers were ``hill
hopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill hopping is not a new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Two Grandview High School students died in March 1997 after hill
hopping on East 129th Street in south Kansas City. In March 1996,
four North Kansas City High School students were similarly killed
in a 1966 Ford Mustang on North Cleveland Avenue near Russell Road.
</P>
<P>
   And last year Shawnee officials took steps to prevent hill
jumping on a stretch of West 67th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the teen who warned motorists on Argo Road, knows his
message wasn't heeded by everyone. Most people did slow down, but
others simply ignored the teens and continued speeding.
</P>
<P>
   He wonders whether it would help to widen the shoulders on Argo
Road and to add more police patrols _ and possibly speed bumps _ in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Sheriff's Capt. Ron Kellogg said speed bumps and
widened shoulders would be of little help. He said that the
Sheriff's Department did what it ccould with periodic speed traps
but that drivers needed to obey the 35 mph speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   Kempster suggests parents educate their children on the dangers
of hill hopping. He said inexperienced drivers don't realize how
easy it is to lose control at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sorry situation that some of the decisions young people
are making are costing them their lives and other people's lives,''
Kempster said, ``along with severely injuring and disabling
others.''

EPA OFFICIALS ANNOUNCE INVESTIGATION INTO GIANT HOG PRODUCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ Federal officials announced Friday that they
have begun a new pollution investigation into the giant hog
producer Premium Standard Farms in north Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, although in its early stages, ``has already
revealed significant violations of the Clean Water Act,'' U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the
EPA, filed legal motions in U.S. District Court in Kansas City to
intervene in a federal lawsuit filed against Premium Standard Farms
by citizens of north Missouri. The citizens group has accused
Missouri's largest hog producer of repeated discharges of animal
wastes into streams in violation of federal clean water laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not aware of any violations,'' Charlie Arnot, a
spokesman for Premium Standard Farms, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials from Washington have recently been on Premium
Standard Farms property, Arnot said, but reports from those
inspectors sounded positive.
</P>
<P>
   He said his company saw no new allegations in the Justice
Department's motion to intervene. ``The claims have not changed and
the facts have not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, if allowed into the case, would seek
fines of $25,000 per day for each violation before Jan. 31, 1997,
and $27,500 for violations after that date.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon is
negotiating to settle allegations of pollution violations in a
state lawsuit against the hog producer.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials made clear Friday that their concerns go
beyond the allegations in that case. They include new violations,
identified only recently in the EPA's investigation begun out of
the agency's Washington offices, not its regional offices in Kansas
City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, prepared jointly by the EPA and the Justice
Department in Washington, suggested the federal motion to intervene
may affect the state negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA and the Department of Justice are hopeful that the
motion...will encourage all parties to come together to discuss a
settlement that will bring Premium Standard Farms in compliance
with federal and state laws, improve water quality and protect the
welfare of the residents of the three county area.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office had a representative in Washington
to meet this week with Justice Department attorneys about the new
legal motions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome their involvement for this important issue,'' said
Mary Still, a spokeswoman for the attorney general. ``At this point
we don't know how it will affect our settlement talks.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA initiated the investigation at the request of Citizens
Legal Environmental Action Network, a request made 45 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Speer, an attorney for the environmental group in its
federal case, said the EPA's actions this week will have national
significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be, I believe, one of the most closely watched
environmental cases in the nation,'' Speer said.
</P>
<P>
   Premium Standard Farms, the third largest hog producer in the
nation, raises more than 2.5 million hogs a year in the north
Missouri counties of Mercer, Putnam and Sullivan. The operations
produce 750 million gallons of hog wastes, stored in lagoons and
later sprayed onto more than 40,000 acres of Missouri farm fields.
</P>
<P>
   The company has had numerous pollution problems over the years
including fish kills and waste spills. The most recent occurred
this month when a work crew left open a valve on its spraying
equipment, allowing up to 2,000 gallons of wastes into Raccoon
Creek, according to a Premium Standard Farms statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incidents like this are unacceptable,'' said John Meyer, the
company's chief executive. ``An incident like this is particularly
disappointing in light of the hard work and substantial resources
we have dedicated to environmental improvements in the last three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ozark chapter of the Sierra Club, which has worked closely
with the citizens network in its legal actions against Premium
Standard Farms, welcomed the federal intervention efforts, as well
as the new investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thankfully, the federal government has stepped in to save
Missouri from itself,'' said Ken Midkiff, program director for the
Sierra Club in Missouri. ``The settlement negotiations appeared to
provide more protection for the polluter than the public health and
welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the settlement have not been revealed. But Midkiff
said last week that a draft settlement has proposed that Premium
Standard Farms pay a $1 million fine and install up to $25 million
in new anti-pollution equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Midkiff has criticized the settlement, saying the fines were not
steep enough and the terms didn't ensure that the new pollution
equipment would be installed.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Dye, agriculture coordinator for the Missouri Sierra Club,
said intervention from Washington was needed because state
regulators and officials in the EPA's regional office have failed
to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking to them for years, and it doesn't smell any
better today in north Missouri,'' Dye said.

NEW CENTURIES ARE OLD HAT FOR OLATHE BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS and DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ The 112-year-old First National Bank of
Olathe has been down this road before.
</P>
<P>
   After opening on June 15, 1887, as the first nationally
chartered bank in Johnson County, the bank has been through one
moment of end-of-century angst without the world ending. And it
says it's ready to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   To prove their point, bank officials in Olathe plan to open
their doors at 9 a.m. Jan. 1, 2000 _ a Saturday and a national
holiday. The doors will stay open until noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't think of a better way to celebrate the new year
and the new millennium than to provide our customers this special
convenience and reassurance that their bank is ready to serve
them,'' said Dennis Meyer, president and chief executive officer of
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday hours on a national holiday ``sends a message to
customers, `Yeah, we're ready for Y2K, bring it on,' '' said Jim
Maag, executive vice president of the Kansas Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Maag said he thought the plan to be open Jan. 1 was a first for
Kansas, but he expects other ``We're ready for Y2K'' campaigns to
sprout in the next six months. Federal regulators require banks to
inform customers of their efforts to battle the bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leaving nothing to chance,'' said Mike Major, chairman
of the bank's Y2K committee.
</P>
<P>
   Having met the June 30 deadline set by federal regulators to
test its mission-critical systems, the Olathe bank is focusing on
reassuring its customers that their money is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Similar efforts are playing out across the country, where 98
percent of all banks are considered Year 2000-ready. Bank tellers
are wearing ``Ask Me About Y2K'' buttons, and banks are having Y2K
Community Conversations and sponsoring radio spots to warn about
potential scams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing all kinds of advertising and public service
announcements,'' said Charlotte Birch, public relations director
for the American Bankers Association, which represents 6,000 large
and small banks across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what else you can do but stand on your head and
spit nickels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board isn't spitting nickels but has taken
an unusual step. This week, central bank governors voted to make
special loans to banks, thrifts and credit unions that might need
emergency funds because of consumer fear about Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   The loans, to be offered from Oct. 1 to April 7, are designed to
help financial institutions ``more confidently commit'' to making
loans to other banks during the Year 2000 transition.
</P>
<P>
   The interest rate charged by the Fed will be slightly higher
than the prevailing federal funds rate of 4.97 percent, which banks
charge each other for overnight loans.  &LR; brk:Cleared for takeoff
 &LR; tx:Y2K problems in the nation's air traffic control system have
been eliminated, the Transportation Department said this week.
</P>
<P>
   An independent firm examined and approved system repairs
completed June 30 by the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA's
independent inspector general's office also has certified the
system as Y2K-ready.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K watchers have been dogging the FAA for more than a year,
contending the agency that monitors the nation's aircraft traffic
wouldn't be ready for the Jan. 1 date change. The Transportation
Department, the FAA's parent agency, has repeatedly received
failing grades on Y2K report cards filed by a congressional
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has 628 computer systems. Of those, 424 were designated
mission-critical, meaning they are vital to the operation of the
agency. Of the 424 systems, 152 required Year 2000 repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K certification came from Science Applications
International Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, which in April conducted a live test in Denver, will
continue tests for the rest of the year, agency officials said. The
FAA is also drawing up contingency plans for power outages or other
outside problems.  &LR; brk:Pentagon passes muster  &LR; tx:Based on tests
earlier this month, Pentagon officials are confident that their
network of 1,069 computer systems designed to track the hardware of
warfare will work without a glitch during 21st-century combat.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out tests for ordering, shipping and receiving
everything from toilet paper to bullets, logistics officials
created a parallel computer environment that mimicked the real
system. The virtual time machine simulated the 64th day of the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what we don't know, so at some point we could
have some surprises,'' military official Roger Kallock told Reuters
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   During testing, three glitches appeared in mission-critical
systems that previously were certified as Y2K-ready. Those glitches
occurred during efforts to transfer data to outside sources from
the Army, Navy and U.S. Transportation Command.
</P>
<P>
   The problems were considered minor and are being fixed, said the
U.S. Joint Interoperability Test Command.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials said they considered the test to be
the largest of a linked U.S. computer system.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Management and Budget says the military will spend
$3.65 billion on Y2K, nearly half the entire federal year 2000
budget of $8.2 billion.

SOME ANGELS ARE BAD LOSERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Word is that Chuck Finley did some serious damage to a water
cooler and a TV at Edison Field after a game the other day. This
action is not unusual after a bad game during a frustrating Anaheim
Angels season.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Finley had just finished pitching his
best game in six weeks. He gave up only one run and three hits in
72/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Finley's performance, the Angels lost the game in the
10th inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have had to deal with many losses this season. Losses
on the field, and the loss of many key players to injury.
</P>
<P>
   Losing happens, but the issue here is how to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are 13{ games out of first in the AL West, mired in
an eight-game losing streak. The season, barring a miracle, is all
but lost.
</P>
<P>
   So how do they deal with it?
</P>
<P>
   Not well, if history is any indication. Each player has his way
of dealing with losing. Who is to say which is right and which is
wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Some Angels apparently have decided their way of dealing with
losing is the only way. Players and others close to the team say
the clubhouse is divided because of it.
</P>
<P>
   There's a group of players that dislikes seeing others leave the
clubhouse with smiles on their faces after a loss. Maybe these
Angels should take their own advice, as displayed on a T-shirt that
some wear under their jerseys: ``Shut up and play.''
</P>
<P>
   No better example of that came late last season as the Angels
lost their division lead in September to the Texas Rangers. Players
were upset because Jim Edmonds maintained a friendly disposition
during the collapse. Because he bounced around the clubhouse with a
carefree attitude.
</P>
<P>
   But Edmonds and Tim Salmon were the only players to produce in
September. Edmonds hit .340 with a team-high five homers and 20 RBI
that month.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds is still recovering from shoulder surgery, so the team
has found others to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Gary DiSarcina made a good point last month when his return from
injury coincided with the contract extension of manager Terry
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the focus gets blurred,'' DiSarcina said.
``Situations with what the manager is doing, or what (general
manager) Billy Bavasi is doing blurs your focus from what the team
needs to focus on, which is winning each game.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the focus has shifted from Collins' situation to demeanor in
the clubhouse. And the result is the club has gone from 6{ games
out at the All-Star break to the brink of trading Finley and others
because the season is lost.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi now must deal with a lost season himself. Does he trade
Finley, Ken Hill, Garret Anderson? Bavasi has about a week to
decide, all the while knowing that a trade of Finley sends a
message to the clubhouse: We're done, get ready for next year.
</P>
<P>
   For Angels fans, the message is a little different: Are you
ready for some football?

HOME FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE ROAD AS METS TOP CUBS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Merengue Night at Shea Stadium, the theme played
out so strongly that manager Bobby Valentine of the Mets criticized
the timing of turning the evening into what appeared to him to be
basically another road game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice night for the fans,'' a steaming Valentine said
after the Mets had rallied from three runs down for a 5-4 victory
over the Chicago Cubs to pull within 1 1/2 games of the Atlanta
Braves for the first time since May 26. ``But I wish they all were
Mets fans. It's a shame this team never gets any appreciation in
its own home park.
</P>
<P>
   ``To honor a visiting player the night after Orel Hershiser
records his 200th victory, and there's nothing on the scoreboard.
Rickey Henderson set some records on the road trip that just ended
and he comes up to pinch hit and they're playing merengue. Maybe
we'll get it together one of these days. I think they'll get it
together.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own words, Valentine was venting the feelings of his
players, who were upset at the sometimes unfriendly atmosphere with
the Mets in a pennant race and just back from a 6-2 road trip.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of the sellout crowd of 52,135, Sammy Sosa, the
guest of honor and the Dominican Republic's favorite son, hit a
three-run home run off Masato Yoshii in the first inning not long
after Sosa had been honored for the 66 home runs he hit last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The fans cheered almost as hard in the seventh inning, when Mike
Piazza, who once spent a winter in the Dominican Republic to work
on his catching skills, shattered his bat but still lined what
turned out to be the game-winning single off Scott Sanders to break
a 4-4 tie.
</P>
<P>
   And the night's biggest cheers were reserved for Turk Wendell,
who struck out Sosa in the eighth to preserve the lead, and the
Dominican right-hander Armando Benitez, who struck out two in
pitching a perfect ninth for his ninth save of the year.
</P>
<P>
   On a day the Mets traded for a new No. 2 starter in Kenny
Rogers, the speculation was whether Yoshii would eventually be
shifted to the bullpen when Valentine returns to a five-man
rotation in what is, for at least one turn, a six-man starting
staff.
</P>
<P>
   The question arose because Yoshii struggled through his third
rough outing in his last four starts. The 34-year-old right-hander
has been inconsistent this season. He was nearly sent to the minors
after losing three of his first four starts. Yoshii then pitched
like an ace from May 2-25, a span of five starts, in which he
picked up four straight victories and the Mets won all five games.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii followed that stretch with two rocky outings, both
losses, and then put together four straight good starts, winning
once and losing once, 1-0, to Greg Maddux in Atlanta, while not
receiving a decision in the others.
</P>
<P>
   This month, however, Yoshii's roller-coaster pace has been in
dive mode again. He left Friday night with one out in the sixth
inning, runners on first and third, and the Mets down by 4-1. Rigo
Beltran bailed Yoshii out of the jam, and then the Mets' hitters
took him off the hook when they tied the game with three runs off
Kevin Tapani in the bottom of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoshii still allowed seven hits and four runs in his five
and a third innings. In 21 innings in July, he has allowed 18
earned runs for an earned run average of 7.71.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have not announced what they will do when they activate
Rogers. They might place Greg McMichael on the disabled list,
retroactive to July 17, with shoulder stiffness. But McMichael
threw from a mound Friday for the first time since taking a
cortisone shot on Monday, and he pronounced himself fit to pitch in
a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could also option Jason Isringhausen to Triple A
Norfolk or demote Octavio Dotel, should he struggle against the
Cubs at Shea Saturday afternoon. Of course, Phillips could pull off
another trade; Isringhausen believes he will be traded before next
Saturday's deadline, perhaps to Baltimore for hard-throwing
left-handed reliever Arthur Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the future, Yoshii was spotty Friday night, serving up
a three-run homer to Sosa in the first inning, then shutting the
Cubs out over the next four innings, even catching Sosa looking at
a third strike in the third with a follow-through that turned into
a somersault for Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoshii could not get out of the sixth. And the Mets, who had
scored their first run on a Brian McRae groundout, looked as if
they were going to waste an opportunity to gain ground on the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   But they finally got to Tapani in the sixth, with a little help
from Tyler Houston. With runners on second and third and one out
after Piazza had popped out, Robin Ventura popped a ball off in
foul territory off third base. It was an easy play for Houston, but
he momentarily looked back to see if he was going to collide with
Manny Alexander, who had just entered the game at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was covering third, however, and when Houston looked
back up, he lost the ball. His one-hand grope was too late. Given
the reprieve, Ventura grounded to second with the infield back, and
it was now a 4-2 game with two out.
</P>
<P>
   McRae then worked a walk and Benny Agbayani sliced a line drive
to right-center field. The ball eluded center fielder Curtis
Goodwin and went to the fence. Two runs scored on the triple, the
score was tied at 4-4 and the Mets were on their way to gaining on
Atlanta.

U.S., CANADIAN TRIBES PLEDGE KINSHIP, SUPPORT TO EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer

<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ In a ceremony rich with religious pageantry,
pride and hope, major Native American groups from the United States
and Canada on Friday pledged to work in tandem to expand political
rights and protect cultural values on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   The ``sacred document,'' as it was described by the groups'
leaders, declares that while boundaries were drawn between the two
countries by ``others' hands,'' these ``arbitrary lines have not
severed, and never will, the ties of kinship among our peoples.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This event is a statement to the world, and to the leadership
of Canada and the United States, of a sovereignty that has always
existed and will always prevail,'' said Ron Allen, president of the
National Congress of American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration pledges that U.S. and Canadian tribes will
support each other as they work for a variety of goals, from
raising children ``in the loving traditions of our peoples'' to
promoting the right of Native Americans to move freely across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Among 3,000 Native American delegates gathered in Vancouver,
however, the Declaration of Kinship and Cooperation had a much
deeper meaning for peoples who have often found themselves
fragmented, confined to reservations and living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coming back to strength, it's a uniting of Red nations.
There is power in numbers. Now we can attack our issues as a single
people,'' said Kiko-Lee Montilla, 17, a high school student and
member of the Arawak First Nation in California.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Fontaine, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations
in Canada, described the accord as ``a defining moment in our
cultural history. ... Governments are going to have to pay
attention to our issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a member of the Jamestown-S'Kallam Tribe on Washington
state's Olympic Peninsula, said the declaration will have many
practical applications.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Canada's federal government has formally
apologized to the country's 633 ``first nations'' for once taking
Native American children from their villages and putting them in
boarding schools, where native languages could not be spoken and
many youngsters were abused.
</P>
<P>
   Tribes in the United States are using Canada's example as they
seek to have President Clinton deliver a similar apology for past
mistreatment and land takings. In turn, Canadian tribes are
studying and seeking to copy legal strategies used by U.S. tribes
to open gambling casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration on Friday capped what was the first joint
assembly of major U.S. and Canadian Native American groups in 60
years, and the largest convocation of indigenous leadership in
North America in the 20th century. A total of 54 chiefs signed
Friday's declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the Vancouver Convention Center was a curious
mixture of the modern economic world in which Native Americans
exist, and the traditional cultural world their leaders seek to
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   One exhibition hall was filled with displays of native-run
enterprises from the Red Feather Investment Corp., offering
pre-paid phone cards, to the Omaha Nation Tobacco Co. Big
corporations like Weyerhaeuser Canada and the Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce bought booth space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost seems like a corporate partnership with a trade
show. The cultural values are missing,'' complained Joe James, a
young man from the Nuu-cha-nulth Nation on the west coast of
Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
   But in the main meeting hall, however, the U.S.-Canadian
document was treated as a ``sacred document.'' It was covered with
cloth, a traditional protection against hostile spirits. A long
procession led by drummers ushered in the signing ceremony, with
Fontaine clad in full headdress. Cedar branches were waved over the
declaration. The air filled with smoke, a Coast Salish blessing was
pronounced over the declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirits are watching us; they look kindly on us,'' said
Salish elder Fred Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Native Americanss are also watching out for themselves. They
face very different challenges on both sides of the 49th Parallel.
</P>
<P>
   In British Columbia, which was settled without agreements with
Native peoples, Native Americans bands are seeking treaties giving
them control of land, the right of self-government, fishing and
hunting rights, and money for economic development. A major
agreement between British Columbia and the Nisga'a Tribe awaits
ratification by Canada's House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, by contrast, Native Americans are fighting
legislation sponsored by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., that would
repeal the sovereign immunity of tribes on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sovereignty is the fundamental authority of tribal governments
to govern their own affairs,'' Allen said. ``Specific leaders, such
as Slade Gorton on our side of the border, cannot abrogate those
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Fontaine added: ``Sovereignty is all about defining one's place
in our land. It is not about independence or succession.''
</P>
<P>
   Native American leaders said Friday that various government
agencies in both countries, such as the U.S. State Department, have
been uncooperative and aloof from claims of sovereignty. The
declaration Friday ``brings our struggle onto the international
stage,'' Fontaine said.
</P>
<P>
   One man cheering as the agreement was signed was Maurice Eben,
who lives near Pyramid Lake in Nevada. Eben leads a Native American
group called the Burial Site Protection Commission. It seeks to
track down and repatriate human remains and artifacts from Native
American burial sites that were once looted and have found their
way to museums and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Eben has had trouble working across the border, and in securing
the clout needed to bring bones and burial instruments back to
their native tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This declaration will give us as a people another tool with
which to work on the federal governments of both countries,'' Eben
said. ``Because of laws in some cases, and inaction in others, we
have been stopped from completing our responsibility to our
ancestors.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank M. Johnson Jr., the legendary federal jurist from Alabama
whose historic civil rights decisions led to ostracism,
cross-burnings and death threats but helped to change the face of
the segregationist South in the 1950s and 1960s, died Friday. He
was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson fell last week and was hospitalized in Montgomery, Ala.,
but had returned home. He developed pneumonia, and died at home,
said Wayne Greenhaw, a former reporter and a friend of the family.
Burial will be on Tuesday in Haleyville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The judge set standards in the South and often in the nation on
voting rights, employment discrimination, affirmative action, the
rights of mental patients to adequate care and of prison inmates to
protection from inhuman conditions. But it was his knell for Jim
Crow that was revered and reviled.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone old enough to remember, the terrible images are
indelible: the lynched black men, the firebombed churches, crowds
shrieking hatred, a skirmish line of deputies on the Pettus Bridge
at Selma, Ala., peaceful marchers attacked with cattle prods and
snarling police dogs at Birmingham, Ala., and a defiant Gov. George
C. Wallace of Alabama vowing to stand in the schoolhouse door to
bar black children.
</P>
<P>
   In that turbulent era, with the national conscience tottering
and a few courageous men and women asking Americans to decide what
kind of people they wanted to be, Johnson loomed as a towering
figure _ an uncompromising defender of civil liberties who came to
be known as the federal judiciary's most influential, innovative
and controversial trial jurist.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed by President Eisenhower a year after the
Supreme Court's school-desegregation decision, Brown vs. Board of
Education. Johnson, a Republican in the Democratic South, arrived
on the bench in Montgomery on Nov. 7, 1955, just as the storm of
the civil rights movement was about to break.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, on Dec. 1, Rosa Parks, a black seamstress,
refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus to a white rider,
as required by city law. Her arrest prompted a bus boycott led by
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a 26-year-old minister who had
just moved to Montgomery for his first pastorate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's first major ruling was to join the majority on a
three-judge panel that struck down the Montgomery bus-segregation
law as unconstitutional, applying the principle of Brown vs. Board
of Education: that separate but equal facilities were inherent
violations of the due process and equal-protection clauses of the
14th Amendment. He would use that reasoning again and again to
create a broad mandate for racial justice in Alabama and across the
South.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned almost four decades _ 24 years in U.S.
District Court in Alabama and 13 years in an appeals court with
wide jurisdiction in the South _ Johnson ordered the desegregation
of public schools and colleges, parks, libraries, museums, depots,
airports, restaurants, restrooms and other public places, as well
as the Alabama State Police.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 he issued another historic order that allowed King to
lead a 52-mile march from Selma to Montgomery to protest the denial
of black voting rights. He did so after Alabama troopers clubbed
marchers and used tear gas in a spectacle witnessed on television
by a horrified nation, and after President Johnson federalized the
Alabama National Guard to protect the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   When state courts failed to act forcefully to end racial
violence _ as in the case of Viola Liuzzo, a white civil rights
worker from Detroit who was shot to death while riding in a car
with a black man _ Johnson sent the killers to jail on federal
civil rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   His justice was often innovative, even in minor cases. In one,
theft charges were brought against a white man and four black men
that he had hired to help him steal peanuts from a federal
warehouse. The jury acquitted the white man, but convicted the
blacks. Johnson, poker faced, sentenced the black men to 30 minutes
in custody.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decisions were legion: He cleared the way for
registering black voters, outlawed poll taxes, struck down state
laws barring blacks and women from jury service, expanded the right
of the poor to court-appointed lawyers, and issued the first court
order for legislative reapportionment in the nation's history,
anticipating the Supreme Court's one-man, one-vote rule.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark decision, Johnson ordered Alabama to reform its
crowded, understaffed mental hospitals, and detailed the rights of
patients to decent care. Later, he found barbarous conditions in
Alabama's prisons and threatened to close them unless they were
made habitable and safe for inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's voluminous, well-researched opinions often spelled
out detailed standards for his reforms, and in some desegregation
and discrimination cases laid out specific quotas, timetables and
goals that he called ``affirmative action.'' He also appointed
overseers to enforce such orders.
</P>
<P>
   To many fellow white Alabama residents, he was a traitor. To
segregationists, he became a despised symbol of federal usurpation
of states' rights. There were mountains of hate mail and scores of
threatening telephone calls. Crosses were burned on his lawn twice.
His mother's home was firebombed, although she was not hurt. For
nearly two decades, federal marshals protected the judge and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Upstaged and outmaneuvered, Gov. Wallace, who had been a law
school classmate of Johnson's at the University of Alabama, called
him an ``integratin', carpetbaggin', scalawaggin', baldfaced
liar,'' and charged that he was trying to take over the executive
powers of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Name-calling aside, a national debate developed on whether
unelected federal judges were intruding too much in state affairs
and assuming too many state and local powers. With appointees of
President Johnson overseeing Alabama schools, prisons, mental
hospitals and elections, the news media began calling the judge the
real governor, and some even said his rule was preferable to that
of Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Johnson insisted that he had intervened only when state and
local officials failed to perform their constitutional duties. ``My
basic philosophy as a trial judge and as an appellate judge is to
follow the law and the facts without regard to the consequences,''
he said once in a rare interview.
</P>
<P>
   And to many, Johnson was a hero. King called him a jurist who
had ``given true meaning to the word justice.'' Time magazine put
his portrait on its cover in 1967 and called him ``one of the most
important men in America.'' In 1980, Bill Moyers devoted two
installments of his television program ``Bill Moyers' Journal'' to
the judge, and said he had ``altered forever the face of the
South,'' and ``earned an enduring place in our history for his
courage and wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, President Carter nominated Johnson to be director of
the FBI. The move was widely acclaimed, but the judge withdrew
after undergoing heart surgery and facing a long recuperation. Two
years later, Carter named him to a seat on the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, three years after Johnson shifted to senior judge
status, President Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of
Freedom, saying that his ``unwavering commitment to equality under
law helped dismantle segregation and bring our nation closer to the
ideals upon which it was founded.''
</P>
<P>
   A stern, forbidding figure on the bench, Johnson, _ tall, gaunt,
with chiseled Lincolnesque features _ never raised his voice in
court, and resisted wearing a black robe or using a gavel, symbols
of authority he said he did not need. He usually worked 11-hour
days. Peering over half-spectacles, the judge, as one lawyer put
it, ``looked at you like he was aiming down a rifle barrel.'' But
almost every lawyer who tried a case before him attested to his
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Away from court, the judge drank bourbon, chewed tobacco, went
fishing and played golf, usually at an Air Force base rather than a
country club where he had been shunned. Invitations to dinner were
rare; there were snubs in church and on the street. But he seemed
untroubled by Montgomery's ostracism. He retained a few close
friends, including law clerks, and with a mischievous grin and a
gravelly drawl, he regaled them with the down-home wit of a
back-country storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Minis Johnson Jr. was a back-country boy, and it explained
a great deal about his fierce independence and stoicism. He was
born in the small town of Haleyville, Ala., on Oct. 30, 1918, the
oldest of seven children of Frank and Alabama Long Johnson, who
were farmers and teachers. His father later was a probate judge and
became the only Republican in the Alabama Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson roots were in Winston County, in the remote hills of
northwest Alabama. Long a Republican stronghold, the county
rejected slavery and tried to secede from the state after Alabama
left the Union in 1861. Styling itself as the ``Free State of
Winston,'' it tried to remain neutral in the Civil War, and
eventually sent more men to fight for the Union than the
Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson went to grade school and his first years of high school
in Haleyville, but helped by his parents' suggestion, he entered
the Gulf Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Miss. After graduating
in 1936, he worked for a year as a surveyor and married Ruth
Jenkins of Winston County. He then attended a state college and a
business school in Birmingham, studying accounting and bookkeeping,
before enrolling at the University of Alabama as a junior in a
prelaw program.
</P>
<P>
   His wife also was a student at the university, and after
graduating she helped to put him through the university law school
by teaching speech therapy in a high school. One of her pupils was
Lurleen Burns, who later married George Wallace and served as
governor when term limits barred him from seeking re-election.
Johnson, who recalled Wallace as the most politically ambitious of
his classmates, graduated at the top of his law school class in
1943.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Army as a private later that year, was
commissioned as an infantry lieutenant and won a Bronze Star in the
Normandy invasion as a platoon leader in Gen. George Patton's 3rd
Army. Wounded twice in battle, he finished the war as a legal
officer in England and mustered out as a captain.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Alabama, he settled in Jasper, went into law
practice and soon had a reputation as an excellent criminal defense
attorney. He also got involved in Republican Party politics. By
1952, he headed Alabama Veterans for Eisenhower and became a state
campaign manager in Gen. Eisenhower's winning presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   His reward was appointment in 1953 as the U.S. attorney for
Northern Alabama. He again quickly established an impressive
record, winning a peonage conviction, for example, against two
white planters who had bribed Mississippi jailers to bind over
black prisoners to work for them.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he was appointed U.S. district judge for Middle
Alabama, a lifetime post. At age 37, he was the youngest member of
the federal judiciary, and one of a small group of Southern judges
_ Elbert Tuttle, John Minor Wisdom and J. Skelly Wright, among them
_ who had been backed by Eisenhower's campaign manager and attorney
general, Herbert Brownell. Fair, strong-willed, independent and
sensitive to civil rights issues, these men played major roles in
the social and political transformation of the segregationist
South.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson moved into a spartan Workers Project Administration
courtroom on the second floor of the post office in Montgomery, a
federal outpost that flew the Stars and Stripes rather than the
Stars and Bars that topped the Statehouse seven blocks away. It was
to be his court for the next 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike higher court colleagues, federal district judges are
usually part of the local scene, their appointments traceable to
community involvement and local politics, their professional and
social lives intertwined with the local power structure. But to
Montgomery, Johnson was an outsider, a Republican from upstate who
was out of step with old boy traditions. And he was to remain so.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His first big case was the challenge to Montgomery's bus
segregation law, set off by Rosa Parks. Joining Judge Richard Rives
in a majority opinion, he struck down the law as a violation of
constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, and
cited the Supreme Court's 1954 ban on school segregation.
</P>
<P>
   More than a vindication of King's bus boycott, it was the first
time that Brown vs. Board of Education had been applied to a
non-school case, and it cleared the way for eventual desegregation
of public services across the South. It also became a key to
Johnson's judicial development: If a right applied in one area, he
could apply it in another.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 20 years, as the civil rights struggle unfolded,
Johnson _ alone or as part of three-judge panels _ desegregated
schools, parks, depots, airports, museums, libraries, restaurants,
restrooms and other public places and services. In many of the
decisions, his chief opponent was Wallace, who became an Alabama
state judge in 1958 and governor in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   They collided first in 1959, when Wallace impounded records to
impede black voter registration. The records had been subpoenaed by
the federal Civil Rights Commission, and Johnson threatened to hold
Wallace in contempt unless he released them. Wallace complied, but
in a roundabout way that enabled him to remain publicly defiant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Johnson found a pattern of deliberate discrimination _
trick tests and acts of intimidation _ against blacks in Alabama
voter registration. His remedy was to order the registration of any
black who measured up to the ``least qualified white.'' The formula
became standard in voting cases in the South and was incorporated
by Congress into the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Removing other barriers to voting by blacks, Johnson abolished
Alabama's poll tax, and in 1962 was one of three judges who ordered
the state Legislature reapportioned on a population rather than
geographic basis. It was the first order of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Johnson and Wallace faced off again as thousands of
militant civil rights marchers led by King descended on Selma for a
protest march to Montgomery. Wallace banned the march as a peril to
public safety, and, in scenes televised to the nation, deputies at
the Pettus Bridge attacked marchers with clubs, tear gas and
electric-shock cattle prods.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered both sides to stand down, then pondered
whether to let the march proceed. The risks were high; Wallace
would not guarantee protection. But after the National Guard was
federalized, Johnson gave the go-ahead, calling the right to march
``commensurate with the enormity of the wrongs that are being
protested.'' He added, ``In this case, the wrongs are enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a peaceful march, but the next day one participant, Viola
Liuzzo, was shot and killed. In the ensuing criminal trial, a
Lowndes County jury acquitted three Ku Klux Klansmen, even though
an FBI informant testified that he saw one defendant commit the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The men were later tried on federal charges of violating the
slain woman's civil rights. When the jury declared itself
deadlocked, Johnson, speaking carefully to avoid a mistrial,
exhorted it to try again, saying the evidence could not be clearer
nor the jurors more intelligent and impartial. The men were then
convicted and the judge sentenced them to the maximum term of 10
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama State Police never had a black trooper until 1972,
when Johnson ordered an end to ``blatant and continuous
discrimination'' and told the state to hire equal numbers of blacks
and whites until blacks made up a quarter of the 650-member force.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Johnson's most important decisions did not involve race.
In 1971, he found horrific conditions in Alabama's mental
hospitals: thousands of warehoused, tranquilized patients, poorly
fed, unbathed for days, living in reeking, overcrowded quarters,
and no semblance of treatment. His sweeping reforms detailed
precise goals for care and treatment, including staff-patient
ratios, and over the next six years he forced mental health budget
increases, from $16 million to $86 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he ruled that 14 residents of an Alabama school for the
mentally ill had been sterilized in violation of their
constitutional rights in the previous decade. He issued strict
guidelines for such sterilizations, including court approval after
hearings in which incompetent people were represented by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Johnson found Alabama's prisons unfit for habitation,
with inmates packed into unventilated cells, exposed to filth and
rampant violence and deprived of adequate food, sanitation and
medical care. ``The state has a right to convict people for
criminal offenses and send them to the penitentiary, but they were
not sent there to be killed through starvation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered broad reforms that included ``three wholesome
and nutritious meals a day,'' ``a bed off the floor,'' and ``one
toilet per 15 inmates.'' Wallace complained that the reforms were
creating a ``hotel atmosphere'' in the prisons, but the judge
retorted: ``The elimination of conditions that will permit maggots
in a patient's wounds for over a month before his death does not
constitute the creation of a hotel atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   When Alabama officials failed to carry out the reforms, Johnson
appointed a receiver to operate the prisons, and by the 1980s
visitors reported dramatic improvements in sanitation, inmate
education and professional standards.
</P>
<P>
   After recovering from the heart surgery that forced him to
withdraw as the nominee to head the FBI, Johnson returned to the
bench. In a widely noted 1978 case, he ruled that Alabama State
University had discriminated against whites in its hiring
practices. It was the first time that a federal court had found a
black institution guilty of bias against whites.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, he was elevated by President Carter to the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, with jurisdiction in Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. After a court
reorganization, he later sat on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, which comprised Alabama, Florida and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As an appellate jurist, he placed Alabama's mental health system
under a receivership after concluding that the state had failed to
comply with his reform orders. He also joined a decision that
extended constitutional protections to illegal aliens, overturning
$1,000 tuition fees imposed on each undocumented child by the
school board in Tyler, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also joined in reversing a lower court that had banned
44 textbooks from Alabama public schools in a suit by
fundamentalist Christians, who contended that they promoted a
godless, secular humanism. The textbooks _ in history, social
studies and even home economics _ endorsed no views but tolerance,
self-respect, maturity and self-reliance, he found.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who stepped down in 1992, received the American Bar
Association's first Thurgood Marshall Award in 1993, as the person
``who most exemplifies Justice Marshall's spirit on behalf of
protecting civil rights.'' In Montgomery, where Johnson was once a
pariah, the federal courthouse was named in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1989 address, Johnson reflected on an era that had changed
the South. ``The civilizing function of a judge has been defined, I
think, as `the removal of a sense of injustice,''' he said. ``I
have come to the firm conclusion that the American people revere
the concept of justice, and their conscience tells them to obey the
law once they understand what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge is survived by his wife, Ruth, whom he married in
1938; a brother, James Noel Johnson, of Montgomery; and two
sisters, Ellen Ruth Harvill of Montgomery, and Mary Ann Bates, of
York, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   He was the subject of three biographies: ``Taming the Storm: The
Life and Times of Frank M. Johnson Jr. and the South's Fight Over
Civil Rights,'' by Jack Bass (Doubleday, 1993); ``Judge Frank
Johnson and Human Rights in Alabama,'' by Tinsley E. Yarbrough
(University of Alabama Press, 1981), and ``Judge Frank M. Johnson
Jr.: A Biography,'' by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Putnam, 1978).
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, whose father was assassinated in 1968, went to
Montgomery in 1977 to write about Wallace, but switched subjects
and during a year in Alabama developed a close relationship with
Frank and Ruth Johnson, whose adopted son, Johnny, had died in 1975
at age 28. ``I was awestruck,'' Kennedy said. ``Here was a man who
utterly vindicated my family's central notion that a single man can
make a difference.''

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A 35-year-old man was hailed as a hero after
guiding his elderly and disabled neighbors to safety during a fire
that killed a woman and injured several others.
</P>
<P>
   The early morning fire Friday killed Ileen Shane, 54, as she
tried to escape flames and smoke on the third floor of the
Owensmouth Gardens apartments in the Woodland Hills community of
Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the building said 35-year-old Steve Katz escorted a
visually impaired man and his wife in a wheelchair away from a rain
of embers on the third floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for him, we would have gotten hit from the
falling debris,'' said Gerald Robles, who has partial sight in one
eye. ``He caught us and pulled us to the back door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still seems like a bad dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz shied away from the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others were helping out, too,'' he said. ``I don't consider
myself a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the fire began in a common room, and its
cause does not appear to be suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   As smoke spread through the third floor shortly before 3 a.m.,
Shane tried to flee but collapsed in front of the third-floor
elevator, officials said. Her apartment was the closest to the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters found Shane dressed in a bathrobe with her purse
tightly clenched under her arm as they extinguished the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had she stayed inside her apartment, she probably would not
have succumbed to the smoke,'' said Battalion Chief Robert Rose of
the Los Angeles Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said Shane had only recently moved into the building,
and she kept to herself. Neighbors said she had a sticker on her
door that read, ``In case of fire, please rescue cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane's son arrived at the apartment and took out a cat, but he
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very private person, very quiet,'' said one of
Shane's neighbors, Laurie Joyce. ``She used to love to read and
minded her own business.''
</P>
<P>
   Five people were taken to hospitals, where they were treated and
released, said Jim Wells, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire
Department. Eight others were treated at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters doused the fire within 34 minutes and used ladders
in some cases to rescue several elderly residents from their
windows.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 tenants of the 200-unit complex were evacuated. The
federally subsidized apartments house disabled and elderly people
capable of living independently.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, who described himself as ``educationally handicapped,''
said he awoke to the sound of the fire alarm and screams from his
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Left with no electricity, he grabbed his lantern and staggered
through smoke before finding Robles and his wife, Ruth, trying to
escape in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to go out the front entrance where it was
raining embers. He was screaming, `Oh my God!' I turned them around
and guided them in the right direction,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   After looking out the window and seeing flames above his
second-floor unit, he ran up the stairs toward the third floor,
where he found other people struggling to find their way down
stairs with pets in tow in complete darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no lights in the stairwell. I slowly walked them
down to safety, using my lantern,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Another resident, Joan McGurrin, said Katz helped her and her
friend, along with each of their poodles, down the darkened
stairwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped me down. The light was out in the stairwell, and I
couldn't see,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some evacuees opted to stay with families, and others will be
temporarily housed at the Holiday Inn in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The low-income complex, owned by the Los Angeles Housing
Authority, just celebrated its 20th anniversary and underwent
$2million in renovations about two years ago to remedy earthquake
damage, said George McQuade, a Housing Authority spokesman. City
building inspectors recently made a routine check of the complex
and found it to be up to code.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing suspicious, but there is a thorough
investigation whenever there is a fatality in a fire,'' Rose said.

FRANK M. JOHNSON, 80, LEGENDARY CIVIL RIGHTS JURIST 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank M. Johnson Jr., the legendary federal jurist from Alabama
whose historic civil rights decisions led to ostracism,
cross-burnings and death threats but helped to change the face of
the segregationist South in the 1950s and 1960s, died Friday. He
was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson fell last week and was hospitalized in Montgomery, Ala.,
but had returned home. He developed pneumonia, and died at home,
said Wayne Greenhaw, a former reporter and a friend of the family.
Burial will be on Tuesday in Haleyville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The judge set standards in the South and often in the nation on
voting rights, employment discrimination, affirmative action, and
the rights of mental patients to adequate care and of prison
inmates to protection from inhuman conditions. But it was his knell
for Jim Crow that was revered and reviled.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone old enough to remember, the terrible images are
indelible: the lynched black men, the firebombed churches, crowds
shrieking hatred, a skirmish line of deputies on the Pettus Bridge
at Selma, Ala., peaceful marchers attacked with cattle prods and
snarling police dogs at Birmingham, Ala., and a defiant Gov. George
C. Wallace of Alabama vowing to stand in the schoolhouse door to
bar black children.
</P>
<P>
   In that turbulent era, Johnson loomed as a towering figure _ an
uncompromising defender of civil liberties who came to be known as
the federal judiciary's most influential, innovative and
controversial trial jurist.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed by President Eisenhower a year after the
Supreme Court's school-desegregation decision, Brown vs. Board of
Education. Johnson, a Republican in the Democratic South, arrived
on the bench in Montgomery on Nov. 7, 1955, just as the storm of
the civil rights movement was about to break.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, on Dec. 1, Rosa Parks, a black seamstress,
refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus to a white rider,
as required by city law. Her arrest prompted a bus boycott led by
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a 26-year-old minister who had
just moved to Montgomery for his first pastorate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's first major ruling was to join the majority on a
three-judge panel that struck down the Montgomery bus-segregation
law as unconstitutional, applying the principle of Brown vs. Board
of Education: that separate but equal facilities were inherent
violations of the due process and equal-protection clauses of the
14th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned almost four decades _ 24 years in U.S.
District Court in Alabama and 13 years in an appeals court with
wide jurisdiction in the South _ Johnson ordered the desegregation
of public schools and colleges, parks, libraries, museums, depots,
airports, restaurants, restrooms and other public places, as well
as the Alabama State Police.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 he issued another historic order that allowed King to
lead a 52-mile march from Selma to Montgomery to protest the denial
of black voting rights. He did so after Alabama troopers clubbed
marchers and used tear gas in a spectacle witnessed on television
by a horrified nation.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decisions were legion: He cleared the way for
registering black voters, outlawed poll taxes, struck down state
laws barring blacks and women from jury service, expanded the right
of the poor to court-appointed lawyers, and issued the first court
order for legislative reapportionment in the nation's history,
anticipating the Supreme Court's one-man, one-vote rule.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark decision, Johnson ordered Alabama to reform its
crowded mental hospitals, and detailed the rights of patients to
decent care. Later, he found barbarous conditions in Alabama's
prisons and threatened to close them unless they were made
habitable.
</P>
<P>
   To many fellow white Alabama residents, he was a traitor. To
segregationists, he became a despised symbol of federal usurpation
of states' rights. Crosses were burned on his lawn twice. His
mother's home was firebombed. For nearly two decades, federal
marshals protected the judge and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Upstaged and outmaneuvered, Gov. Wallace, who had been a law
school classmate of Johnson's at the University of Alabama, called
him an ``integratin', carpetbaggin', scalawaggin', baldfaced
liar.''
</P>
<P>
   But to many, Johnson was a hero. King called him a jurist who
had ``given true meaning to the word justice.'' Time magazine put
his portrait on its cover in 1967 and called him ``one of the most
important men in America.'' In 1980, Bill Moyers devoted two
installments of his television program ``Bill Moyers' Journal'' to
the judge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, President Carter named Johnson to a seat on the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1995, three years after Johnson
shifted to senior judge status, President Clinton awarded him the
Presidential Medal of Freedom, saying that his ``unwavering
commitment to equality under law helped dismantle segregation and
bring our nation closer to the ideals upon which it was founded.''
</P>
<P>
   A stern, forbidding figure on the bench, Johnson _ tall, gaunt,
with chiseled Lincolnesque features _ never raised his voice in
court, and resisted wearing a black robe or using a gavel, symbols
of authority he said he did not need.
</P>
<P>
   Away from court, the judge drank bourbon, chewed tobacco, went
fishing and played golf, usually at an Air Force base rather than a
country club where he had been shunned. Invitations to dinner were
rare; there were snubs in church and on the street. But he seemed
untroubled by Montgomery's ostracism.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Johnson won a Bronze Star in the Normandy
invasion as a platoon leader in Gen. George Patton's 3rd Army.
Wounded twice in battle, he finished the war as a legal officer in
England and mustered out as a captain.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1989 address, Johnson said, ``I have come to the firm
conclusion that the American people revere the concept of justice,
and their conscience tells them to obey the law once they
understand what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge is survived by his wife, Ruth, whom he married in
1938; a brother, James Noel Johnson, of Montgomery; and two
sisters, Ellen Ruth Harvill of Montgomery, and Mary Ann Bates of
York, Ala.

   S&AMP;P AND DOW JONES DROP ON INTEREST RATE CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 4.03 points, or
three-tenths of a percent, to 1,356.94, and the Dow Jones
industrial average declined 58.26 points, or half a percent, to
10,910.96. But the NASDAQ composite index rose 7.96 points, or
three-tenths of a percent, to 2,692.40.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 fell 4.4 percent for the week, its worst performance
since the week ended Sept. 4, on concern that interest rates are
headed higher. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan,
said Thursday that the central bank might raise borrowing costs to
head off inflation. The concern over interest rates overshadowed
corporate profits that are growing at the fastest rate since the
third quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK EXCHANGE TO GO PUBLIC
</P>
<P>
   America's two largest stock markets, the New York Stock Exchange
and the NASDAQ market, are moving quickly to convert from nonprofit
institutions to for-profit corporations, with the New York exchange
confirming that it could be ready to sell shares to the public as
early as mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know what the New York Stock Exchange would
be worth if its own shares were traded on the Big Board. But using
a back-of-the-envelope method of calculation produces a rough
market value for the Big Board of $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA ONLINE BLOCKS COMPETITORS
</P>
<P>
   America Online closed its service to people using software
introduced Thursday by two of its fiercest rivals, Microsoft and
Yahoo. The programs were written to tap into one of America
Online's most popular features: instant messages, which appear in
an open window on the recipients' computer screens only seconds
after they are sent.
</P>
<P>
   SAFEWAY TO BUY RANDALL'S MARKETS
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket chain Safeway will buy the Randall's Food
Markets chain for about $1.4 billion in cash and stock. The
combined company will operate more than 1,645 stores in 19 states
and in Canada, employing more than 183,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   TAX BILL OFFERS BREAKS FOR BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   The far-reaching $792 billion tax cut passed by the House on
Thursday is full of fiercely sought but little noticed special
provisions for business and industry.
</P>
<P>
   BANKERS' ARRESTS REPORTED IN JAPAN
</P>
<P>
   Six former executives of Nippon Credit Bank, a failed Japanese
bank, were arrested on suspicion of covering up more than $830
million in losses, the state-run NHK television reported. It said
the investigation of the cover-up might spread to the Ministry of
Finance, which might have known that the bank was in trouble but
took no steps, out of fear of provoking its collapse. Among the six
arrested was Shigeoki Togo, a former president.
</P>
<P>
   US WEST PROFITS INCREASED 9.4 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   US West, the regional phone company being acquired by Qwest
Communications, reported a 9.4 percent gain in second-quarter
income, buoyed by data and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASES IN BRAZIL
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's unemployment rate increased to 8.4 percent in June from
8.37 percent a month earlier, as hiring by industrial conglomerates
failed to offset a wave of corporate cutbacks. Two state-controlled
companies said they were considering layoffs. Cemig, an electric
utility, may dismiss 400 workers, while Copasa, a water treatment
company, could discharge 200.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOLOGY VIA THE ISRAELI ARMY
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army's elite computer corps, Mamram, is gaining

SOSA TOTES WEIGHT OF HIS WORLD WITH EASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Striding to the players' entrance at Shea Stadium,
Sammy Sosa was surrounded by eight police officers even though
there is little doubt that it would be hard for him, with biceps
the size of an officer's leg, to find an obstacle too tough to get
around.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles these days are the type that muscle cannot help
overcome, as the Chicago Cubs slugger copes with the adoring fans
that follow his every step, begging for an autograph, a photo or a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa obliges when he can, signing as he walks, smiling the smile
that became as familiar as his home run stroke last season. But
becoming a man of the people means the people want him all the
time. The Mets honored Sosa before the game Friday night, which was
Merengue Night at Shea Stadium. But hours before plaques and
trophies were handed to him, Sosa got his due from the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Kids waving Dominican flags sprawled across the top of the
visitors' dugout, chanting his name and waiting for a glimpse of
Sosa. Police, who pulled the teen-age boys back, had about as much
luck containing the feverish fans as they had containing teen-age
girls when the Beatles played Shea Stadium. For Sosa, this was a
day in the life.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering trophies, as well as checks to his charitable
foundation, before the game, Sosa promptly brought the fans to a
frenzy with his 35th home run of the season, a three-run shot, in
the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable, all the support that I have from my
people,'' Sosa said before the game. ``It's not only my own people,
but all the people.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite like this everywhere, Sosa acknowledged. New
York, with a strong Latin population, provided him with a parade
last year after his season of 66 home runs. And on this night
celebrating the Dominican culture, it was Sosa who was the center
of attention. His last appearance here was on April 16 of last
season, 97 home runs ago for Sosa and long before he and Mark
McGwire pounded their way into the record book. He entered Friday
night's game leading the major leagues with 34 home runs, one ahead
of McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like home,'' Sosa said. ``It's a great night, with
great support. That's something that doesn't happen every day. When
it happens to someone like me, I have to thank God for giving me
the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The notoriety that Sosa gained last season has made him not just
a magnet for youths, but also for politicians. Sosa, who has worked
hard to give back to his country, was passing out a letter to
Congress on Friday, a letter that he said had been given to him by
the president of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernandez, asking
Congress to support passage of Caribbean Basin enhancement
legislation that he believed would provide economic benefits for
his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I'm doing this is because it's for my people,'' he
said. ``It's going to create a lot of jobs, help a lot of people.
The economics are going to be much better. I'm not a politician,
but anything that's to do with my country, I will do it. One of the
reasons I do have influence is because I'm not a politician. I have
an opportunity to help my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Marichal, a Hall of Fame pitcher and now the secretary of
sports in the Dominican Republic, said during the pregame
presentation, ``Sammy Sosa, you are a hero to everybody, not only
because you play great baseball, but because you are a great human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Sammy Sosa Charitable Foundation taking up his
attention, Sosa avoided much of the talk about a run at the home
run record of 70, which McGwire set last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no pressure,'' Sosa said. ``I don't put any pressure
on myself. I'm physically and mentally a strong guy. I know what it
takes to get ready. For me, everything that happens right now I
feel happy about. I enjoy everything. I'm so happy that Mark is
getting hot again. We're right there, but there is still a long way
to go. We'll do our job and see what happens.''

U.S., CANADIAN TRIBES PLEDGE KINSHIP, SUPPORT TO EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ In a ceremony rich with religious pageantry,
pride and hope, major Native American groups from the United States
and Canada on Friday pledged to work in tandem to expand political
rights and protect cultural values on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   The ``sacred document,'' as it was described by the groups'
leaders, declares that while boundaries were drawn between the two
countries by ``others' hands,'' these ``arbitrary lines have not
severed, and never will, the ties of kinship among our peoples.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This event is a statement to the world, and to the leadership
of Canada and the United States, of a sovereignty that has always
existed and will always prevail,'' said Ron Allen, president of the
National Congress of American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration pledges that U.S. and Canadian tribes will
support each other as they work for a variety of goals, from
raising children ``in the loving traditions of our peoples'' to
promoting the right of Native Americans to move freely across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Among 3,000 Native American delegates gathered in Vancouver,
however, the Declaration of Kinship and Cooperation had a much
deeper meaning for peoples who have often found themselves
fragmented, confined to reservations and living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coming back to strength, it's a uniting of Red nations.
There is power in numbers. Now we can attack our issues as a single
people,'' said Kiko-Lee Montilla, 17, a high school student and
member of the Arawak First Nation in California.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Fontaine, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations
in Canada, described the accord as ``a defining moment in our
cultural history. ... Governments are going to have to pay
attention to our issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a member of the Jamestown-S'Kallam Tribe on Washington
state's Olympic Peninsula, said the declaration will have many
practical applications.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Canada's federal government has formally
apologized to the country's 633 ``first nations'' for once taking
Native American children from their villages and putting them in
boarding schools, where native languages could not be spoken and
many youngsters were abused.
</P>
<P>
   Tribes in the United States are using Canada's example as they
seek to have President Clinton deliver a similar apology for past
mistreatment and land takings. In turn, Canadian tribes are
studying and seeking to copy legal strategies used by U.S. tribes
to open gambling casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration on Friday capped what was the first joint
assembly of major U.S. and Canadian Native American groups in 60
years, and the largest convocation of indigenous leadership in
North America in the 20th century. A total of 54 chiefs signed
Friday's declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the Vancouver Convention Center was a curious
mixture of the modern economic world in which Native Americans
exist, and the traditional cultural world their leaders seek to
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   One exhibition hall was filled with displays of native-run
enterprises from the Red Feather Investment Corp., offering
pre-paid phone cards, to the Omaha Nation Tobacco Co. Big
corporations like Weyerhaeuser Canada and the Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce bought booth space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost seems like a corporate partnership with a trade
show. The cultural values are missing,'' complained Joe James, a
young man from the Nuu-cha-nulth Nation on the west coast of
Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
   But in the main meeting hall, however, the U.S.-Canadian
document was treated as a ``sacred document.'' It was covered with
cloth, a traditional protection against hostile spirits. A long
procession led by drummers ushered in the signing ceremony, with
Fontaine clad in full headdress. Cedar branches were waved over the
declaration. The air filled with smoke, a Coast Salish blessing was
pronounced over the declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirits are watching us; they look kindly on us,'' said
Salish elder Fred Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Native Americanss are also watching out for themselves. They
face very different challenges on both sides of the 49th Parallel.
</P>
<P>
   In British Columbia, which was settled without agreements with
Native peoples, Native Americans bands are seeking treaties giving
them control of land, the right of self-government, fishing and
hunting rights, and money for economic development. A major
agreement between British Columbia and the Nisga'a Tribe awaits
ratification by Canada's House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, by contrast, Native Americans are fighting
legislation sponsored by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., that would
repeal the sovereign immunity of tribes on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sovereignty is the fundamental authority of tribal governments
to govern their own affairs,'' Allen said. ``Specific leaders, such
as Slade Gorton on our side of the border, cannot abrogate those
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Fontaine added: ``Sovereignty is all about defining one's place
in our land. It is not about independence or succession.''
</P>
<P>
   Native American leaders said Friday that various government
agencies in both countries, such as the U.S. State Department, have
been uncooperative and aloof from claims of sovereignty. The
declaration Friday ``brings our struggle onto the international
stage,'' Fontaine said.
</P>
<P>
   One man cheering as the agreement was signed was Maurice Eben,
who lives near Pyramid Lake in Nevada. Eben leads a Native American
group called the Burial Site Protection Commission. It seeks to
track down and repatriate human remains and artifacts from Native
American burial sites that were once looted and have found their
way to museums and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Eben has had trouble working across the border, and in securing
the clout needed to bring bones and burial instruments back to
their native tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This declaration will give us as a people another tool with
which to work on the federal governments of both countries,'' Eben
said. ``Because of laws in some cases, and inaction in others, we
have been stopped from completing our responsibility to our
ancestors.''

<P>
   regular classified advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the newspaper argue that the world is different
today. The Star no longer has a monopoly. The reported 96 percent
penetration the newspaper enjoyed in the 1950s (although Brisbane
believed that figure was inflated) is now down to about 40 percent.
(However, Brisbane said, about 60 percent of adults read the daily
newspaper.)
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there are national newspapers, cable television,
e-mail newsletters and all other manner of competing news and
advertising outlets available to Kansas Citians today.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the ad prohibitions hurt advertisers by disallowing steep
discounts, and it could even hurt local small-newspaper publishers
by eliminating The Star _ a big potential buyer _ from bidding for
their paper when they want to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers also said that similar judgments today usually die
automatically after 10 years. The judgment against the newspaper
has gone on for 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, managers and owners from the 1950s are long gone.
For example, Roberts and Sees, who left the paper in the mid-1960s,
died in 1967 and 1971, respectively.  &LR; brk:Easing restrictions
 &LR; tx:The Justice Department, in filing its motion in support of The
Star's motion, said provisions in the old judgment were aimed at
preventing the newspaper from engaging in anti-competitive conduct.
``However, they also now appear to be preventing The Star from
engaging in certain pro-competitive and efficient conduct, to the
detriment of advertisers and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The motions were filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Kansas
City. They don't ask to kill the judgment from 1957, but to replace
it with a greatly watered-down version.
</P>
<P>
   The significant new provision would require The Star to inform
the Justice Department if the newspaper proposed to spend more than
$5 million to buy a local publication. Normally, the paper _ like
other newspapers _ wouldn't need to inform the Justice Department
unless it wanted to buy another publication for $15 million or
more. That $5 million provision would end in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tim O'Donnell, who owns Keltatim Publishing Co., which publishes
the Olathe Daily News and the Lee's Summit Tribune, was concerned
about that provision.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if Knight Ridder, the parent of The Star, wanted to
buy his publications, ``I'd be flattered.'' But the $5 million
trigger point would add a roadblock to any negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It retards the dynamic of capitalism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements notifying the public of the motion will be
published in two Sunday editions of The Kansas City Star, as well
as in editions of the Wall Street Journal and Editor &AMP; Publisher, a
trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   After the ads are published, a so-called comment period of 60
days begins during which objections can be filed. That will be
followed by a 30-day period during which the Justice Department
will answer the comments. The Justice Department could change its
mind, although that is viewed as unlikely because the department
has spent years thinking through this matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that nothing will occur in the comment period to
make them change their minds,'' said Benjamin Mann, a lawyer with
Blackwell Sanders Peper Martin, who is also representing The Star.
</P>
<P>
   After that, an order could be entered that essentially ends the
old judgment.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: AN ATHLETE IS FORCED TO LEARN CAUTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (rk) 
 By   MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Druckenmiller, the San Francisco 49ers' reserve quarterback,
sounded tired. He said he had slept about three hours on Wednesday
night, the day before his rape trial went before a 12-member jury
in Christianburg, Va. He thought about his future, and the very
real possibility that he might spend the rest of his life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play quarterback in the NFL, you're used to
controlling things,'' Druckenmiller said in an interview Friday,
one day after being acquitted of a rape charge. ``But now my fate
was in the hands of other people. It was a terrible place to be.
Not being able to do anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terrified, yes. The whole experience was one of those
life-altering things. I was scared, but I was also angry at the
same time because I knew I was innocent. The whole thing was a
learning experience. I have completely changed the way I approach
my life now. I will be much more careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller was charged in April with raping a 22-year-old
graduate of Virginia Tech, the school where Druckenmiller was a
star player, after Druckenmiller and the woman spent the night
drinking at a Blacksburg, Va., party. The woman said she had passed
out from too much drinking and awoke to find the 6-foot-4-inch,
240-pound Druckenmiller on top of her; in closing arguments, the
assistant prosecutor, Skip Schwab, said, ``Druckenmiller took
advantage of a drunken girl.'' Druckenmiller's lawyers said the sex
was consensual.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-day trial that often included graphic sexual
testimony, it took a jury of nine men and three women about one
hour to acquit Druckenmiller of the charge. If he had been found
guilty, he faced five years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother, my family, are so relieved,'' Druckenmiller said.
``But they were devastated by all of this. It has been really tough
on me and everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller said that he was considering suing his accuser for
defamation of character and that he had spoken to several lawyers
who might represent him. ``That is something I am definitely
looking at right now,'' he said. ``I think I have a pretty good
case.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If she regretted what we did that night, that is one
thing. To try and ruin someone's life by lying, that is another. I
regret what happened, but what we did was consensual. We both
wanted what happened. Then all of a sudden she was making false
accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   It has become so commonplace to read about athletes' being
accused of crimes that there is a tendency to believe the charges
are true. That may have been the case when the accusations against
Druckenmiller became public. But the 26-year-old Druckenmiller, who
has no history of these sorts of accusations, was found not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Druckenmiller case represents is a cautionary tale
for athletes. Druckenmiller now says he will cut down on the amount
of time he spends in bars and clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be a fool if I did not learn a lesson from this,'' he
said. ``Unfortunately, when you are an athlete, you are a target.
You are forced to isolate yourself. That's what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller's agent, Gary Wichard, is constantly preaching to
his clients that they need to be cautious and can trust no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what can happen if you're not careful,'' Wichard said.
``You can end up in front of 12 people. You had better be smart
enough not to be caught in that situation, whether it is a
businessman who comes to you with a scam, or a woman, or anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was innocent and his life has been dragged through the mud.
I hope a lot of players were watching closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller is scheduled to report next week to the 49ers'
training camp in Stockton, Calif. He realizes how close he came to
reporting somewhere else. ``For the first time in months,'' he
said, ``I will be thinking only about football.''

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ The Kansas City Star, which was found guilty
of wielding monopoly powers in the 1950s and has operated under a
special judgment since, on Friday asked that most provisions of
that judgment be ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department _ which prosecuted The Star in the 1950s
_ filed its own motion on Friday, supporting the newspaper's
request. The Justice Department's motion basically said its
restrictions were no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the biggest practical effect would be to allow
The Star to buy small, local publications in the metropolitan area.
It also could allow the newspaper to change its advertising rate
strategy. Among other restrictions, the special judgment prevented
the newspaper from extending steep discounts to reliable
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Star would pretty much be able to operate the way other
newspapers operate,'' said Arthur S. Brisbane, the newspaper's
president and publisher.
</P>
<P>
   A final ruling on the newspaper's request could come in a little
more than 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in 1955 found The Star and its advertising
director guilty on an antitrust indictment for monopolizing the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper _ which then had a commanding market presence and
which owned the only television station in the city through the
early 1950s _ played hardball. If companies advertised with other
media outlets, The Star assigned them poor ad location or even
refused their ads.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1957 final judgment, the newspaper was forced to sell
WDAF-TV and WDAF radio. The newspaper also was slapped with the
judgment that imposed the special rules. Among other things, those
rules prevented The Star from buying other newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an outmoded, special regulation of The Star,''
said James S. Campbell, a lawyer with the Wilmer, Cutler and
Pickering law firm in Washington who represents the newspaper.
``This would be the deregulation, if you will, of The Kansas City
Star.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rose, the chairman of Sun Publications Inc., said
metropolitan daily newspapers are no longer the monopolies they
once were, so he was not surprised that the change appears
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was more concerned about the loss of different news
perspectives. ``There may be a subtle stifling effect on the
diversity of opinion,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's parents, who started Sun Publications, got a settlement
from The Star as a result of the antitrust litigation. Sun, now
owned by Lionheart Newspapers, today publishes the Johnson County
Sun, Northland Sun-News, College Boulevard News and others.
</P>
<P>
   Another area newspaper publisher was less sanguine about the
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only concern is, the giant would get larger and more
powerful and it would not be to the benefit of the market,'' said
Ben Weir Jr., publisher of the Independence Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less competition would benefit no one in the market except The
Kansas City Star,'' Weir said.  &LR; brk:Subpoenas, indictments  &LR; tx:The
litigation against the newspaper began in the summer of 1952, when
the Justice Department subpoenaed a truckload of records from the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1953, a federal grand jury indicted The Star; Roy A.
Roberts, its president; and Emil Sees, its advertising director,
for alleged violations of the Sherman antitrust act.
</P>
<P>
   There was a political tint to the case. The Justice Department
probe was one of the final acts of the administration of President
Harry S. Truman, a Democrat. Sen. Frank Carlson, a Kansas
Republican, charged on the Senate floor that the probe was a
punitive act against the newspaper for exposing corruption in the
Pendergast political machine in Kansas City, which had ties to
Truman.
</P>
<P>
   But in the trial that followed, dozens of witnesses said they
were strong-armed by The Star. One advertiser of an auto show said
the newspaper told him ``we can make or break your show'' and then
informed him of how much he needed to spend on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball player, who was co-owner of a flower shop that
advertised in the now-defunct Journal-Post, was told he'd get no
coverage in sports stories, even if he hit 100 home runs, unless he
switched his flower shop ads to The Star.
</P>
<P>
   The charge against Roberts, the newspaper's president, was
dropped. But Sees, the advertising director, was found guilty of
one count of attempted monopolization and fined $2,500 in 1955. The
newspaper was found guilty of two charges of monopolization and
fined $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals were fruitless, and in 1957 the newspaper was forced to
accept the judgment. It had to divest itself of the television and
radio station. It was prohibited from buying other local newspapers
and was ordered not to arbitrarily refuse to publish ads,
discriminate as to their placement or grant discounts greater than
35 percent to regular classified advertisers.

OUTDOORS: THE KEYS BY KAYAK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla.) (mk) 
 By KEN SCHULTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a bright, still early morning as the skiff motored along
the Spanish Channel into the National Key Deer Refuge in Big Pine
Key, Fla., about 28 miles east of Key West. Mike Wedeking shut the
motor and let the boat drift as he and Bill Keogh lifted a 14
1/2-foot kayak into the water and stabilized it while I gingerly
maneuvered onto the open deck. I felt almost as if I were on top of
a surfboard, and while I was still gauging my low-profile balance,
Bill gave me instructions on how to stand up and pole along.
</P>
<P>
   Stand up? Not this gimpy-legged guy. Leave that to natives in
dugout canoes. Besides, I had spent a total of five hours in a
kayak before, all of that on a placid freshwater pond. Not on a
tidal tropical flat with prowling stingrays, sharks and barracuda.
</P>
<P>
   Mike was soon in an identical kayak and we were paddling around
the tip of a mangrove key. The kayaks moved effortlessly over just
a few inches of water, and in the shallows blue crabs scurried
along near darting schools of small mojarra. A needlefish leaped
out of the water, its line-drive trajectory taking it 8 to 10 feet
through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``See the round green blobs on the bottom?'' Mike said. ``Put
your paddle under one and flip it over. They're a type of jellyfish
and a sure sign that there's not much current in this spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The telltale stringy tentacles underneath proved him right.
</P>
<P>
   Around the back of the island we sneaked into a winding channel.
The water was only six inches deep, surely a spot that only a canoe
or kayak could possibly visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are red mangroves,'' Mike said in a near whisper.
``They're the most saltwater tolerant of the dozen or so mangrove
species.''
</P>
<P>
   We moved on easily and silently, entering a shaded inner sanctum
with a leafy canopy and an eye-level labyrinth of roots. Mike
pointed out a mangrove snail fixed to the underside of an arched
limb about 20 inches above the water. There was a loud splash back
in the dense thicket. Moments later Mike motioned me toward him.
Suddenly four large white birds, 15 feet away, jumped from the
inner treetops and flew behind us. They were clearly different from
the herons and ibises so prominent in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roseate spoonbills,'' Mike said. ``There's only 30 in the
whole Lower Keys, and we haven't seen any in this vicinity since
Hurricane Georges last October.''
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of people are kayak-touring this area,
adding to its reputation for great fishing, diving, bird watching
and snorkeling. Wedeking, a native of England who moved to Florida
with his parents as a boy, runs a kayak-touring and
wildlife-exploring business called Reflections (305-872-2896),
which has grown in each of the four years it has existed.
</P>
<P>
   Keogh, a naturalist and photographer who co-produced a book
about the marine life of the Keys, emigrated from Connecticut
nearly 20 years ago and recently started guiding back-country
kayakers with his business Lost World Adventures (305-872-8950).
The two frequently collaborate with large parties.
</P>
<P>
   Kayaks are terrific for probing great expanses of ultrathin
water around many of the mangrove islands and for quietly
approaching and observing bird and marine life. Many of the people
who do this have no kayaking experience and prefer quiet paddling
to riding a noisy personal watercraft, which are popular elsewhere
in the Keys but prohibited in this area. On full-day trips, kayaks
are transported to the outer keys by skiffs, then paddlers get into
a one- or two-person open-deck kayak, rendezvousing with the skiff
later.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in fishing from kayaks is also growing, and the
pleasure and effectiveness of this is one of the Keys' better-kept
secrets. While scores of powered skiffs take anglers out on the
flats each day for tarpon, bonefish and permit, only a handful of
people use their own muscles to get to the fish. But those who do
can pursue smaller species, some of which are far back in skinny
water where a skiff would run aground.
</P>
<P>
   Keogh has caught bonefish and permit from kayaks, and lots of
barracuda, and he once was guiding kayakers who spooked several
tarpon in a shallow channel, causing a four-foot specimen to leap
over one of the kayaks in its flight.
</P>
<P>
   The first fish I caught, a barracuda, appeared suddenly and
slammed a lure just a few feet from the boat. Startled, I reared
back to set the hook, nearly tipping the kayak and momentarily
spiking my heartbeat. We caught a bunch of small barracuda and
briefly hooked a good-sized bonefish in a few half-serious fishing
diversions from wildlife viewing.
</P>
<P>
   We probably could have caught several sharks had we tried as
there were many lemon, bonnet-head and nurse sharks in the
shallows. My kayak floated over a stationary nurse shark on a flat
that was so shallow it looked as if the kayak's hull would scrape
the back of the long brown creature.
</P>
<P>
   There were also many rays on the flats where the bottoms were
covered with turtle grass, pockmarked with loggerhead sponges, or
composed of hard wadeable sand. Both Bill and Mike proved very
adept at standing in their kayaks, which was a great benefit to
seeing marine life at greater distances, as well as spotting fish
to cast to. I tried it but quickly felt uncomfortably
wobbly-legged.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to top the close, mobile and personal experience that
kayaking provides. I was still thoroughly enjoying it when it was
time to quit in midafternoon. Just before we stopped, a barracuda
that I had caught was thrashing near the kayak when a
four-foot-long lemon shark streaked in and suddenly swirled off
about a foot away. Had the shark grabbed the barracuda he would
have probably towed me over the reef into the Gulf of Mexico.

RULING FORCES INS TO SPELL OUT CAR SEIZURE PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MAGGIE LEUNG  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A trip across the U.S.-Canadian border that has cost
some owners their cars is now less risky, thanks to a ruling issued
Friday in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, the Border Patrol has seized thousands of vehicles,
alleging that the owners were illegally transporting people into
the United States without the proper immigration papers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Judge Thomas Zilly ruled that the car owners were denied
due process and gave the Immigration and Naturalization Service 60
days to revamp its procedures. The INS must now let owners know
exactly why their cars were seized and let them see INS reports so
the owners can argue their case before INS administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, about 1,300 cars have been seized from
Seattle to the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, the owner wasn't even in the car when it was
seized, having lent it to friends. But in trying to recover the
car, the owner would be told he couldn't see the report that
determined he was a smuggler and would receive a form letter saying
he wasn't getting his car back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (INS appeals) process is a joke in terms of the way it's
run,'' said lawyer Bob Pauw, who filed the class-action lawsuit
that resulted in Friday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Said spokesman Harold Malkin of the U.S. Attorney's Office,
which defended the INS in court: ``We respect the court's decision
although it's adverse to our position. And... we are reviewing and
considering our options.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, graduate student Zenebe Gete had few options when his
car was seized.
</P>
<P>
   Gete was driving to Seattle from Vancouver, B.C., to spend the
weekend with friends. He wound up losing his car _ a 1980 Toyota
that he could not afford to replace _ after the Border Patrol
determined that one of his buddies was not a Canadian citizen and
lacked a visa to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gete, now a research engineer at the University of British
Columbia, was pleased by Zilly's ruling. ``That's great. At least
it won't happen in the future. They have to be more specific and
look at each case on its own merits. I'm happy,'' Gete said by
phone Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling doesn't give him any compensation or recourse,
however. Zilly still has to rule on a separate appeal, one that
seeks redress for owners whose cars have been seized over the past
10 years in the Northwest, covering Washington, Oregon, California,
Arizona, Alaska and part of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people each year lose their cars under circumstances
similar to Gete's. In some cases, they were nowhere near a border
checkpoint, where immigration papers typically must be shown. With
probable cause, immigration authorities can stop anyone anywhere in
the United States if they suspect they are smuggling immigrants.
Those stopped must produce citizenship or immigration papers.
</P>
<P>
   If they cannot, they must choose between taking their case to
federal court _ a financial hardship for many _ or going through
INS administrators. Going the INS route often has resulted in their
cars being auctioned off by the INS or being kept for government
use. Some owners have recovered their cars after paying fines
ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In Gete's case, his visa was in order and he was never charged
with a crime. But he has been refused entry into the United States
since his car's seizure, severely limiting his career, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've missed lots of job opportunities and conferences'' in the
United States, he said. ``I cannot apply for jobs there. It has had
a great impact on me. I'm really bitter about it.''
</P>

GORDON IN CIA, FIRED, SOURCES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - State Rep. Tom Gordon worked for the Central
Intelligence Agency at one time and received extensive intelligence
training in the Navy, according to sources familiar with Gordon's
background and records obtained Friday by ''The Arizona Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional sources said Friday that Gordon was fired by the
CIA prior to his stints in the offices of U.S. Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz. When asked whether he was
fired by the CIA, Gordon responded: ``I left my government service
voluntarily.'' He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon served with a Navy SEAL unit in the late 1980s and
trained in terrorism counteraction, political warfare,
indoctrination and naval special warfare intelligence, according to
naval reserve records.
</P>
<P>
   The details of Gordon's military history come to light as the
FBI investigates whether Gordon lied his way onto a free flight to
Bosnia arranged by Hayworth. Hayworth fired Gordon after learning
that he is not an active naval reservist.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Hayworth refused to release additional details
regarding Gordon's hiring and firing. Hayworth's office declined to
say anything else on the matter, citing the ongoing federal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   As the new details emerged, it remained unclear whether Navy
officials authorized Gordon's bizarre Balkans trip. And questions
outnumbered answers.
</P>
<P>
   Was Gordon, a former Navy lieutenant commander, authorized to
board a National Guard plane in Phoenix around May 5 that would
eventually take him to Bosnia? What did he do from the time he
arrived until he returned to Arizona last week? And how did he do
it?
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Gordon, a Republican from Peach Springs
in northwestern Arizona, acknowledged that he had no formal orders
to travel to Bosnia in May. But in an interview, he said he was
involved in intelligence gathering in the region. He also said he
was trying to persuade a naval official, with whom he has worked
for 15 years, to admit he authorized the controversial trip.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma? Coming forward could jeopardize current operations
in the area, Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get this particular naval officer to do this . . . it
gives away to a degree what the circumstances are over there,''
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Anya Guilsher, a spokeswoman for the CIA, said she could provide
no information on Gordon, including whether he had at one point
been employed by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of policy, we don't confirm employment in the
agency,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Documents confirm that Gordon did have training in intelligence
and other covert operations.
</P>
<P>
   According to naval reserve records, Gordon was attached to a
SEAL unit in 1988 in Coronado, Calif., as an inactive duty officer.
His connection to the unit was terminated at his request on May 6,
1988, due to scheduling conflicts with drill training.
</P>
<P>
   A note on the form said Gordon would reaffiliate with the unit
when the ``job conflict'' was resolved. A later document, filed on
October 1988, requested Gordon to report for ``inactive duty
training.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Thursday statement, Gordon said most of his naval career
involves service in ``intelligence or special operations.''
</P>
<P>
   He has received scuba and parachute training and is rated an
``expert'' by the Navy at using pistols and rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon graduated from Brigham Young University in 1982 with a
degree in political science and completed a master's in public
administration at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in 1992.
Much of his study at Harvard focused on Arabic languages, according
to the Harvard registrar's office.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has been under fire since July 16, when Hayworth accused
the freshman state lawmaker of misleading Hayworth's office to get
on a National Guard flight to Bosnia. Gordon worked for Hayworth's
office at the time, providing constituent services in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the Navy are investigating the matter, and Hayworth
has called for a state House ethics probe of Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he has not been contacted by either the FBI or Navy
investigators since he has returned to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He has said since the flap erupted that he was an intelligence
officer for a Navy SEAL unit. He lists service in the Navy from
1984 to 1987, and service in the naval reserves from 1987 to the
present.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth has said that several weeks after Gordon left for
Bosnia, an Army general in the Balkans contacted Hayworth's office,
saying Gordon was involved in disruptive activities. Hayworth then
checked with the naval reserve, who said Gordon had not been called
into active duty.
</P>
<P>
   A June 17 letter from the Department of the Navy to Hayworth
shows that ``Lieutenant Commander Gordon has not been recalled to
active duty.''
</P>
<P>
   A search began for Gordon, who was eventually detained at a base
in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's wife, Camille, has suggested that he was captured by
the Serbs, detained for several weeks, and beaten. Gordon has
declined to answer questions to account for his time in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon worked as a part-time constituent liaison in the northern
part of Hayworth's district.
</P>
<P>
   From March 1997 to January of 1998, Gordon worked in the
Washington office of Sen. John McCain, handling Native American
issues. Gordon is fluent in Navajo and lives in the heart of the
Hualapai Indian Reservation in northwestern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ives, a McCain spokeswoman, said July 16 that Gordon was
``let go.'' On Friday, she said Gordon and McCain had a mutual
parting. She declined to elaborate, citing the FBI investigation.
Gordon told ``The Republic'' July 16 that he left McCain's office
because he was tired of living in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Eule, Hayworth's chief of staff, said his office was aware
``there had been some problems'' with Gordon during his time in
McCain's office. But they assumed it was because Gordon's family
was still in Arizona and he was homesick.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how Gordon's references were checked, Eule refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already dealt with the matter. We're confident his
termination was justified. . . . We're not going to comment anymore
about it.'' &QL;

IN 2001, ODYSSEY TO A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL WILL LEAD TO A SPACE
STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is not enough to be just a hospital anymore. The
fierce competition of the managed-care era has given rise to the
health-care network, the center for treatment of a single disease,
the suite with five-star amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx is taking that
approach one step further. After Saturday's ground-breaking
ceremony, it will begin construction of a children's hospital at
Bainbridge Avenue, near the main hospital complex, that is
designed, essentially, as a space station.
</P>
<P>
   Montefiore officials say the $120 million building, scheduled to
open by mid-2001, will have 106 beds and will provide a full range
of medical services, from a children's emergency room and trauma
center to cancer treatment and organ transplants. It will have a
center for speech, hearing and language difficulties, and another
for epilepsy and neurological disorders.
</P>
<P>
   But there will also be a domed rooftop planetarium, a video link
with NASA's space shuttle program, and an audio link that will
allow children to listen to the wind on the surface of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   This learning center cum new-age theme park was designed by
David Rockwell, known for chic restaurants like Nobu in TriBeCa and
entertainment venues like the new Disney World headquarters of the
Cirque du Soleil. Its science theme is dedicated to the work of the
astronomer Carl Sagan, who died in 1996 after a battle with bone
marrow disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Hospital at Montefiore will be the New York
region's third free-standing hospital for children, after Schneider
Children's Hospital at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Glen
Oaks, Queens, and Babies Hospital at the New York-Presbyterian
Hospital in Manhattan. And the Westchester County Medical Center is
planning a 110-bed children's hospital, expected to open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   While Montefiore doctors originally planned to build a Carl
Sagan Discovery Center within the new hospital, ``the planning
evolved to characterize the hospital itself,'' said Dr. Irwin
Redlener, a pediatrician who will serve as the new hospital's
president.
</P>
<P>
   As Rockwell explains it, the challenge that Montefiore faced was
to transform the typically frightening and impersonal hospital of
endless corridors into a place of ``way finding.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence children will be encouraged to think of themselves as what
he called explorers on a journey to healing. Each child admitted to
the hospital will get an explorer's passport, a wristband and
baseball cards with his or her digital photograph.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they will get an explorer's kit that will include a
compass, a kaleidoscope, a periscope _ and even a fuzzy stuffed
star.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most high-tech special effects will be reserved for
the lobby, which will contain an electronic map of the Bronx with
pinpricks of light to show where some of the patients live.
</P>
<P>
   As Rockwell acknowledged, ``The lobby is the solar system _ or a
wonderful lobby _ depending on how deeply you want to get into
it.''

SMOOTHER STYLING LOOKS TO THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buick's challenge was daunting: redesign its very successful
full-size LeSabre for a new generation without alienating the old
one.
</P>
<P>
   This is an important goal for Buick, because even though its
LeSabre is the best selling full-size sedan in the nation, its
loyal, conservative customer base is rapidly aging. The mission was
to change the focus from the elderly to the merely middle-aged.
</P>
<P>
   So the LeSabre for 2000 has been revamped nose to tail without
being too blatant about it. Until you take a closer look, it's easy
to mistake the new LeSabre for the 1999 model. All the cues are
still there, but they've been smoothed out and better integrated,
not quite modernized but more in touch with today's styling trends.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the same chassis as the Pontiac Bonneville and
Oldsmobile Aurora, the LeSabre has grown a couple of inches in all
directions, with its wheels pushed out to the corners and an
interior that is more commodious than ever. The Buick grille with
its vertical bars and tri-shield insignia is familiar, but now it's
an interesting oval shape. Character lines crease the hood, roof
and trunk lid in a complementary pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the huge, chrome door handles with the big thumb
buttons that looked like they came off a Hudson Hornet, replaced
with modern monochromatic pull handles.
</P>
<P>
   And gone is the staid dashboard, replaced with an up-to-date
cockpit-style dashboard with a modern ergonomic look. But even this
update has been softened, looking new but still familiar to
traditional drivers of General Motors cars.
</P>
<P>
   These evolutionary changes are well-done, looking to the past
and future, but Buick should have made a cleaner break with the
past, something more along the lines of the late, lamented Riviera,
whose concept-car styling should have pointed the way for the
entire Buick line. The new LeSabre is attractive, but hardly
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is firmer than it used to be, especially with the
optional Touring Package on the test car, and maybe a bit too firm
for those favoring the plush rides of yesteryear's luxury barges.
</P>
<P>
   The new LeSabre has a more solid and competent feel than the
old, no doubt attributable to the 62 percent greater rigidity and
27 percent more bending resistance, according to Buick engineers.
Handling is fairly precise and balanced, though no one is going to
mistake the LeSabre for a sports sedan. For one thing, the steering
has a bit too much power boost and numbness, and the body roll in
corners is still fairly acute.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect that requires no excuses is the sparkling performance
of the 3.8-liter V-6, a standout among GM engines since it was
introduced in 1995. Despite putting out more than 200 horsepower,
the 3.8 is smooth, quiet and economical, and has a reputation for
exceptional durability.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the strong acceleration from the engine, torque
steer was nearly non-existent in this front-drive car.
</P>
<P>
   The powertrain is one of the reasons why LeSabre has more than
50 percent repeat buyers, and why Buick has sold more than 1
million of these big boys in the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is dollar value; for a totally optioned-out big
car like the LeSabre to cost less than $30,000 is certainly worth
taking note. There's also a Custom model available at a lower
price.
</P>
<P>
   Safety concerns are strongly represented, including seat belts
mounted directly to the seats; newly designed air bags with a safer
type of propellent, and seat-mounted side-impact air bags; standard
anti-lock brakes; and a battery system that will turn off any lamp
left on 10 minutes after the car has been parked.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a nicely engineered seat/headrest system designed
to protect front-seat passengers from whiplash injuries in the
event of a rear-ender.
</P>
<P>
   The test car was a good runner, with roomy comfort for five. A
bench seat in front makes the LeSabre a full six-seater. Actually,
I would have preferred the bench seat over the weird console in the
tester.
</P>
<P>
   I was told that this large, plastic setup was a nod to those
drivers who enjoy similar consoles in GM's pickup trucks and
sport-utility vehicles. Indeed, it has a huge storage area and the
flip-up writing surface similar to those on the big trucks.
</P>
<P>
   However, it felt cheap and tacky, very out of place with the
high quality of the rest of the interior, and it took up a
ridiculous amount of space. Specifically, much of it was built to
house a huge, flip-up cup holder that could double as a banquet
table. Well, nearly. The whole assembly was just jarring and over
the top.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I point out the LeSabre to anyone pondering a large
family sedan, especially those looking at Lexus or Infiniti.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely that the LeSabre remake fulfills its mission,
and by all rights should bring some younger drivers into the fold. &QL;

HENRY BROSIN, 94, LED PSYCHIATRIC GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Va., Ill., Wis.)  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Walter Brosin, a former president of the American
Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, the American Psychiatric
Association and the American College of Psychiatrists, died in
Tucson, Ariz., on July 3, three days short of his 95th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Brosin had been a resident of Tucson since 1969, when he was
named a professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona
Medical School, where he helped organize its department of
psychiatry.
</P>
<P>

Ryan and Co. near head of the classes
<TEXT>

   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Cooperstown is where baseball fans take their children to
fulfill the fantasies of H.G. Wells and travel back in time. It is
where you go to revisit baseball through the ages, including when
the 20th century was just dawning. It is where you remind yourself
how strong this game really is, able to survive two World Wars and
a World Series where one team tried to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball keeps colliding with its past, which is among its most
enduring charms. Of the seven members of the class of '99, three _
Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount _ were voted into the Hall
on their first ballot. To find a more distinguished class, you
arguably have to go back to the first one, in 1936, which included
such swingers as Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth and Honus Wagner and pitchers
Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson.
</P>
<P>
   Do you enjoy historical links? The baseball purist wallows in
them. Try these:
</P>
<P>
   Bob Feller pitched his last full season in 1955, the year a
rookie lefthander named Sandy Koufax made his debut with the
Brooklyn Dodgers. Koufax struck out his last hitter in 1966, the
year Nolan Ryan, a farm kid from Alvin, struck out his first, Pat
Jarvis, a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   We have attempted to trace this line of succession back to
Johnson, known as the Big Train, making him the spiritual ancestor
of the Ryan Express. The best thing we could uncover was that
Johnson's last strikeout occurred in 1927, the season of Ruth's 60
home runs. The man who would break Ruth's lifetime record, Hank
Aaron, was a teammate of Jarvis for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Gads, it is almost enough to make one believe in reincarnation,
or possibly Juan Encarnacion, Detroit's young outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the First Timers will be inducted into the Hall along
with Orlando Cepeda, umpire Nestor Chylak, Frank Selee, an
old-timer who managed when it was OK to refer to the Gay '90s, and
Smokey Joe Williams, a Texan from Seguin who dominated the Negro
Leagues for 20 years but whose brilliance as a pitcher went unseen
by white America.
</P>
<P>
   Cepeda will represent the most teams, six, having enjoyed his
most productive years with the Giants and Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan has the distinction of going bi-coastal, playing for
the New York Mets and California Angels, and for both of his home
state teams, the Astros and Rangers. He is not only the game's
strikeout king _ and, yes, it's good to be the king _ he pitched
seven no-hitters and lasted longer in his sport than anyone in any
other team sport.
</P>
<P>
   You would think there is nothing new to be said or discovered
about the sturdy righthander, who was still delivering serious heat
in his 40s. But the search continues, and in this endless process,
we stumbled across a strange but intriguing trivia note.
</P>
<P>
   Of the most durable athletes in the four major professional
sports, each of the leaders carried with him a piece of Houston:
Ryan; Moses Malone, tied with Robert Parish in basketball at 21
seasons; George Blanda, in football, 26 seasons; and Gordie Howe,
hockey, with 32 years on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   This is a terrific tribute to the fluoride in Houston's water,
or perhaps our temperate weather, although how this fits into the
festivities at Cooperstown isn't clear. Look for further bulletins.
</P>
<P>
   Brett and Yount have described themselves as borderline nervous
wrecks, and Cepeda has cried openly, but Ryan has approached the
Cooperstown spectacle as he did most of his best moments _ pretty
much in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the final chapter of my career,'' he said. ``It's the
highest honor.''
</P>
<P>
   You won't get much more emotion than this out of him, although
he could surprise us Sunday. He has wavered a few times in picking
his supreme thrill, at various moments choosing his 300th win, his
5,000-plus strikeouts and his seventh no-hitter. Once, he said it
was hard to top the first time he was picked to the Little League
All-Star team in Alvin and got to wear a new cap.
</P>
<P>
   You tend to believe Ryan whenever he makes one of his aw-shucks
kind of claims. With almost any other modern athlete, you would
know you were being conned. But if we have learned nothing else
over the years, we have learned Ryan isn't anyone else. He doesn't
lie. He doesn't boast.
</P>
<P>
   When Nolan broke Johnson's career strikeout record at Montreal
in 1983, he acknowledged the moment and the ovation of the crowd
with a flicker of a smile and a tip of the cap. The hitter was
young and unaware Brad Mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more interested in Mills' reaction,'' Ryan said. ``He
was looking around as he walked back to the dugout. All he did was
strike out, and the crowd went crazy. He had no idea what was going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The noise goes to another level Sunday, and yes, most of us know
exactly what is going on. Nolan Ryan is.

 EDITORIAL: CAMPAIGN REFORM GAINS AN ALLY  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 24:
</P>
<P>
   The congressional proponents of campaign finance reform gained
an important ally this week when Bill Bradley called for
overhauling the system. Bradley suggested fundamental changes in
the ways elections are financed and promised to reject soft-money
donations to his Democratic presidential campaign, if Republicans
do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is not the first presidential candidate to show
leadership on this issue. That honor belongs to Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz. Together, perhaps, they can exert pressure on their
parties' front-runners, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas. So far, both men have shown a disappointing
tolerance for the old cash-for-influence system.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who formerly represented New Jersey in the Senate,
called for free television time for candidates and the introduction
of some federal funding for congressional campaigns. He also called
for elimination of soft money, which is the main focus of the
bipartisan legislation sponsored by McCain and Sen. Russell
Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   These unregulated donations to political parties are poisoning
the political process by allowing wealthy individuals, corporations
and unions to use the ``party-building'' dodge to evade the federal
limitations on direct contributions to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier last week, McCain got a firm promise from Senate leaders
to hold a full debate on the issue no later than mid-October.
Waiting until autumn had not been the senator's preferred strategy,
nor was it ours. But McCain made a tactical judgment to accept a
delay that will give him time to round up votes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement negotiated with the majority leader, Trent
Lott, R-Miss., the issue will be brought to the Senate floor by
Oct. 12. There will be four days of debate, and amendments can be
considered. The opportunity to offer amendments gives McCain a
chance to build the 60 votes needed to break the filibuster
expected from Lott and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the GOP's chief
opponent of strong campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate agreement places a heavy obligation for fairness on
House Speaker Dennis Hastert. He promised a September vote in the
House, which approved campaign finance reform by a substantial
margin last year. A similarly resounding victory this year would
send the Senate a clear message that the American people want
McCain's soft-money reforms. Passage of McCain-Feingold could, in
turn, open the way to the additional reforms outlined by Bradley.

SPECULATION GROWS THAT MARINERS EXEC MAY GET LARGER ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS AND JOHN COOK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Howard Lincoln, who helped build Nintendo into a
household name in the United States, is planning to resign from the
giant video game maker next year.
</P>
<P>
   The move is sparking speculation that Lincoln, a co-owner of the
Seattle Mariners who has played an active role in the financing of
Safeco Field, could be in line for the team's chief executive post.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could signal a significant shift in who carries the torch
for the ballclub,'' said one source close to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Another Mariners executive said Friday that he has no knowledge
of how Lincoln's retirement affects the baseball ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln will give up his day-to-day responsibilities as chairman
of Redmond-based Nintendo of America on Feb. 14, the day he turns
60. He will continue to sit on Nintendo's board and will assist
with the company's launch of its next-generation game system.
</P>
<P>
   A replacement has not yet been named.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for Nintendo said the company may look at
reorganizing its management structure. Minoru Arakawa will continue
to serve as president.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, who was traveling, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six months, Lincoln, who is described by those who
know him as a baseball fanatic, has taken a more active role with
the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   When the team announced it was trying to recover $60 million of
the $100 million in cost overruns on $517 million Safeco Field, it
was Lincoln who made the team's case to the Public Facilities
District, along with current CEO John Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis has said he's looking at taking a less active role with
the team, but maintained in an interview July 15 that he saw no
immediate reorganization of the ownership group. Ellis, 70, has
served as the chairman and CEO of the Baseball Club of Seattle
since the group assumed control of the Mariners from Jeff Smulyan
in July 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, however, represents one of the most powerful arms of
the Mariners ownership group: The Nintendo faction. Others include
Hiroshi Yamauchi of Kyoto, Japan, president of the Nintendo Co. of
Japan; Minoru Arakawa of Bellevue, president of Nintendo of America
and Yamauchi's son-in-law; and John Bauer, executive vice president
of Nintendo of America.
</P>
<P>
   In his role with the Mariners, Lincoln has been the most visible
of the Nintendo-based owners, while Yamauchi, the majority investor
who put up an initial $75 million to buy the team, has been a
minority partner in ownership decisions and has not seen a game in
person.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week on the opening of Safeco Field,
Lincoln said he believed the full story of the cost overrun dispute
had yet to be told and said the owners were being cast in an unfair
light after putting up $125 million to buy the team and keep it
from being moved in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ownership claims to have lost as much as $30 million
a year on the team, despite winning the division championship in
1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1992, it was such a difficult struggle to save this
for Seattle and keep it from going to Tampa Bay,'' Lincoln said.
``The other side of it was in 1995 when we had that wonderful
playoff experience. Then you say to yourself that every minute the
ownership spent on this was worth it because it was so exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the new stadium and the estimated $25 million in new
revenue it will produce for the club annually, Lincoln sees some
trouble on the horizon due to baseball's volatile labor situation
and escalating payroll. The next round of labor negotiations is
scheduled to commence by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody expects that we will go through another traumatic
experience. It seems to be the nature of the sport,'' Lincoln said.
``But let's not worry about that now. Hopefully, everybody will
come to their senses.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln acknowledged that Mariners owners made an unpopular
decision to ask to be reimbursed for the cost overruns on the new
stadium out of tax money collected to retire the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a popular thing to do,'' Lincoln said. ``But it is
the right thing to do. I realize there's a lot of people who don't
agree with us. But even baseball owners are entitled to their day
in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership since 1983, Nintendo of America, the U.S.
subsidiary of the Japanese game maker, grew from a tiny startup
with a half-dozen employees to a major powerhouse in the video game
business. By 1987, the Nintendo Entertainment System was the No. 1
toy in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Nintendo, Lincoln worked as a corporate lawyer
for the Seattle firm Sax &AMP; MacIver.

M'S SEE ANOTHER ONE SLIP AWAY

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ There was little elbow room on the Metrodome
infield in the bottom of the ninth inning Friday night. The game
was tied, the bases were loaded and all five infielders _ yes, five
_ were playing up.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like the world was encroaching on the pitcher, Jose
Paniagua. He had company, but he was all alone. Nobody was warming
in the Mariners bullpen when Matt Lawton flaired a single to left
to bring in the winning run for the Minnesota Twins in a 5-4
victory that dropped the Mariners to 10 games behind the Texas
Rangers in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get hot,'' catcher Dan Wilson said. ``We've got
to start doing what it takes to win. That's what we need to worry
about right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua had entered the game with a 4-2 lead and no outs in the
seventh. When that inning was over, the Twins had tied it. After a
scoreless eighth, Paniagua stayed in for the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Only twice this season had the right-hander pitched more than
two innings. But Paul Abbott had worked 22/3 on Thursday and was
not available. Closer Jose Mesa is not a preferred option in tie
games on the road. That left Frankie Rodriguez, who threw five
innings Tuesday night, rookie Ryan Franklin and the struggling Ken
Cloude.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer singled to start the ninth. Marty Cordova doubled and
Todd Walker was intentionally walked. Manager Lou Piniella removed
left fielder Ozzie Timmons, inserting Rafael Bournigal as a fifth
infielder to play in front of and slightly to the first-base side
of second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to get out of that situation is a ground ball, a
strikeout or a pop-up,'' said second baseman David Bell. ``If he
gets it over the infielders' heads it's over, basically. It's worth
taking the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawton, who had driven in the tying run on a fielder's choice in
the seventh, sliced a 2-2 pitch in front of Ken Griffey Jr., who
was covering the left side of the outfield. The only throw Griffey
could make was his flip to a fan above the dugout as the Mariners
filed off the field.
</P>
<P>
   It was Paniagua's major-league leading ninth relief loss,
breaking a tie with former Mariner Mike Timlin of the Baltimore
Orioles. Only Timlin has more blown saves than Paniagua's seven.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, of course, Piniella would have preferred to have a
left-hander pitching to the left-handed Lawton in such a crucial
situation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seattle bullpen has no lefties, and Jeff Fassero is not
headed there soon. The erratic starter would not have been
available Friday night anyway, but before the game, he told
Piniella he has corrected some of his recent problems and Piniella
decided to keep Fassero in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the need for a left-handed reliever) has jumped at me for
about three or four years,'' Piniella said. ``I'm talking about a
reliable one.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Minnesota relievers held the Mariners scoreless.
Ex-Mariner Bob Wells, Eddie Guardado and Hector Carrasco blanked
the Mariners over the last three innings as the Twins overcame a
4-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have won that game,'' Bell said. ``I think we should
have scored more runs than we did. It wasn't our defense. It wasn't
our pitching _ they didn't really crush the ball. It's part of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had gotten their lead in classic Seattle fashion.
In the fourth inning, Timmons hit his first major league home run
since 1996, smashing a two-run shot over the center field wall just
out of Torii Hunter's reach.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey followed the next inning with another two-out, two-run
homer off LaTroy Hawkins, an opposite-field poke that was his 31st
of the season, tying the injured Jose Canseco of Tampa Bay for the
American League lead. That homer was the Mariners' 25th against the
Twins this season, setting a club record for homers against an
opponent in one year _ with five games still left between these
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners starter John Halama worked six-plus innings, allowing
three runs on nine hits. One of Halama's trademarks has been his
effectiveness with runners on base, and he did it again Friday
night, stranding five runners in the first two innings before
settling in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself cutting the ball off in the first and second
inning,'' Halama said. ``I wasn't throwing the ball where I was
supposed to be. Dan mentioned it ... and told me to stay on top of
the ball and just go to the catcher. That next inning, it clicked
in right away, and I started throwing the ball well after that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cristian Guzman doubled to lead off the seventh, Brent Gates
singled him in and the Twins had begun the rally that would erase
the Mariners' lead.

FASSERO, SEGUI TOP NAMES ON BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Last July 26, the Mariners were 8{ games out of
first place. At the start of play Friday night, they were nine
games behind.
</P>
<P>
   Last July 31, the Mariners traded Randy Johnson. But just
because their position in the standings has not improved much,
don't expect the M's to let go of soon-to-be free agents again.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman David Segui and pitcher Jeff Fassero can be free
agents after this season, and neither is a sure bet to return to
the Mariners. Longtime designated hitter Edgar Martinez also is
unsigned past '99. But that doesn't mean Woody Woodward, the team's
vice president for baseball operations, is eager to trade them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a pretty good player (who stays through this season
but does not re-sign), there's a chance we'll at least get another
draft pick in return,'' Woodward said. ``It's not like all is lost.
I have no problem with that if we play the baseball I think we're
capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Mariners perform in the week before the trading deadline
next Saturday may not influence Woodward's decisions. To him, the
Mariners still have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're approaching the trading deadline as if we are in the
race, and so any deal we're trying to make will be made with an eye
to the race now, and players that can help us down the road,'' he
said. ``That'll be the No. 1 objective, although we'll also take a
look at a possible deal where we acquire a player who is only here
for the short term. We're still looking at both types of deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners could make a deal in which they move one of their
potential free agents while acquiring players who could help now.
One such scenario could involve the Yankees' Andy Pettitte, who may
be on the trading block. Mariners scouts have attended Pettitte's
past two outings, and Fassero might be a fit with New York for
several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees need left-handed relief help _ their roster includes
departed Mariner Allen Watson _ and despite his struggles, Fassero
could help there. They also would like to cut payroll, and since
Pettitte is eligible for arbitration and could make perhaps $7
million next year, a pitcher in the last year of his deal, like
Fassero, would save them money.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible partner is the Boston Red Sox, whose general
manager and pitching coach (Dan Duquette and Joe Kerrigan,
respectively) held those positions in Montreal when Fassero played
for the Expos. Injuries have made pitching a priority for Boston,
but it's unclear whether the teams' proximity in the wild-card race
will preclude any deals.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Woodward apparently is not working under the
same constraints as many of the teams he has contacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to a couple of clubs the last few days, and
they've either said they're not going to do anything because they
can't add payroll, or they've decided to move as many players as
they can,'' Woodward said. ``We are not in those positions. We're
going to at least continue to explore.''
</P>
<P>
   CLASS OF '99: Mariners broadcaster Dave Niehaus will be calling
the Mariners-Twins game on Sunday, but there's one place he'd
rather be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could be there in Cooperstown, because two of my
great friends are going in,'' Niehaus said.
</P>
<P>
   Niehaus was an Angels broadcaster during Nolan Ryan's glory days
with California in the '70s. He also has developed a close
friendship with George Brett, another player who will be inducted
into the Hall of Fame this weekend. Niehaus called Ryan's first
four no-hitters and was there for Ryan's final game, in the
Kingdome with the Texas Rangers in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Niehaus remembers Ryan routinely throwing 150 to 160 pitches a
game, sometimes exceeding 200. The only physical worries Niehaus
recalled were blisters on Ryan's fingers, made better when the
pitcher soaked them in pickle brine. Ryan autographed Niehaus'
scoresheet from his first no-hitter; the Nolan Ryan Museum in
Alvin, Texas, has been calling about that.
</P>
<P>
   The last pitch of Ryan's no-hitter against Baltimore in 1975? A
knee-buckling change-up, of all things, to the Orioles' Bobby
Grich.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's all-time strikeout record? Niehaus knows it's 5,714 _
``It's an easy number to remember: you just take Babe Ruth's home
runs and add 5,000.'' The knockout blow to Ryan's career? A grand
slam by the Mariners' Dann Howitt just before the elbow-destroying
fastball that was Ryan's last pitch.
</P>
<P>
   After that game, Niehaus shared a heartfelt hug with Ryan and
his wife, Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody who is a parent would be proud to have Nolan
Ryan as a son, not only because of his baseball prowess but because
of his moral character,'' Niehaus said.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Yount will join Ryan and Brett as inductees. Yount got his
3,000th hit off Mariners closer Jose Mesa in 1992, when Mesa was
with Cleveland.
</P>

   AROUND THE HORN: Golfer Tiger Woods will be Ken Griffey Jr.'s
guest at the Metrodome Saturday. ... Griffey has a term for the
0-for-5 he took in Thursday's win over Oakland: the pineapple.
Pineapple? ``Hawaii _ 5-0,'' Griffey said. ... The Metrodome is
Griffey's favorite road park for home runs. He has hit 21 lifetime
homers here, two more than at Yankee Stadium, which ranks second.
... Minnesota is known better for snowmen than sandmen, but don't
tell that to the folks at Sand-tastic Promotions. They're building
a 15-ton sand sculpture of Twins legend Kirby Puckett outside the
Metrodome Saturday. ... The Twins will borrow from the Mariners'
promotions department tonight when they stage ``Turn Ahead The
Clock'' night. Both Seattle and Minnesota will wear futuristic
uniforms, as Seattle did in a home promotion last season.

IT'S HARD TO TELL WHO'S THE CHUMP: UMPS OR BASEBALL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If you think the Mariners' Class AAA pitchers got
knocked around during ill-advised stints in the big leagues, just
wait until the minor-league umps get their shot.
</P>
<P>
   Think they'll survive a home-plate showdown with the likes of
Sweet Lou Piniella, Davey Johnson or Bobby Cox?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, baseball commissioner Bud Selig has hired 20 minor-leaguers
for major league duty starting Sept. 1 _ one day before the major
league guys have threatened to resign _ which will be wildly
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   But what baseball really needs is not a war with the umps, but a
solution to the small-market death march. Who has time to argue
balls and strikes when the fiscal foundation of the industry is in
a torpor?
</P>
<P>
   The commish has promised on many occasions that baseball will
address the chasm between big-market teams and the guppies who
aren't owned by a Ted Turner, George Steinbrenner or Rupert
Murdoch. But now the immediate issue concerns the umpires, who have
voted to take their $15 million severance package and resign.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, baseball needs to use this opportunity to gain more
control of its umpires, who may have misjudged not only their
leverage but their union membership's unity and resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA doesn't stand for referees interpreting rules according
to individual whims and flights of self-important fancy. Why should
baseball umps have free reign? Are you listening, Richie Phillips?
</P>
<P>
   Now Selig and other baseball officials are delirious that the
umps have made the fatal decision to quit. The umps are doing the
dirty work all on their own. All Selig has to do is sit back and
gloat.
</P>
<P>
   But who'll be laughing come October?
</P>
<P>
   Most bosses like to believe that an entire segment of the work
force is as dispensable as paper plates. But a postseason with
minor-league umps behind the plates is a disaster waiting to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it behooves the lords of baseball to negotiate with
these splintering, not-all-are-rotten group of umpires _ some are
actually in shape and competent _ and then move on, as promised, to
the industry's real problem, which is disparity between the Haves
and Have Nots.
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH CHOICE: Trouble in the Bone Yard?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, we all know about the uncertainty of Ken Griffey Jr.'s and
Alex Rodriguez's futures with the Mariners. But the M's have an
option on Jay Buhner's contract and Edgar Martinez is a free agent
after this season, too.
</P>
<P>
   In another time and place, you could rationalize Buhner as a DH,
but the M's will be hard-pressed to spend big money for both
beloved veterans, especially with the injuries that have plagued
Buhner the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a pleasant call, but unless Buhner takes a monstrous
salary cut and/or Buhner's buddy in center field does not insist
Buhner stays, the M's will stick with Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   DUNN DEAL: The new head coach of Seattle's prospective WNBA
franchise was on the job less than 24 hours when she scored her
first victory, as pitchwoman extraordinaire.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after she was announced as coach and general manager of
the professional women's basketball expansion franchise, Lin Dunn's
Tennessee accent has been heard on TV and radio all across the
Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's mantra? ``That's 217-WNBA. That's 217-WNBA. Now y'all go
out and get yourself a season ticket, ya hear?''
</P>
<P>
   FROM SPOKANE TO MINNEAPOLIS?: For Gonzaga basketball coach Dan
Monson, it could go from beat a Gopher, to be a Gopher.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE OF THE WEEK: From umpire Rocky Roe on his union's vote for
mass resignation Sept. 2:
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got 58 or 59 Type A personalities in a small room and
we got worked into a frenzy. People say, `How could you guys do
that?' You can correlate it to the Jonestown massacre. How in the
world did they get people to suck down all that Kool-Aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out not all the umps wanted to take a sip.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-AGENT BONANZA: Next weekend gives sports fans a potentially
unprecedented blitz of comings and goings. At midnight on July 31,
there is the double witching of baseball's trading deadline and the
Aug. 1 start of the NBA's free-agent signing period.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, get out your scorecards.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF THE SONICS: Mitch Richmond may be 34 and on the
downside of his career, but a backcourt of Gary Payton and Richmond
would be tasty ... if Hersey Hawkins gets to stay, too.
</P>
<P>
   FASSERO PREDICTION: If the Mariners trade the veteran lefty, he
will come back next season and pitch great for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   IRON MAN MOYER?: Any more regrets about Piniella taking Jamie
Moyer out of the game in favor of Jose Mesa on Safeco's opener need
only see that 129 pitches was all Moyer could handle.
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE AKERS, BRANDI CHASTAIN &AMP; CO.: Just wondering: Are they
still enjoying their 15 minutes of fame. Or should we vote to
extend it?

WITH ONE SWING, YANKS' JETER KNOCKS OUT INDIANS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No, these are not the 1998 New York Yankees. Roger
Clemens and Andy Pettitte have struggled, Joe Torre missed more
than a month because of prostate cancer, and Jorge Posada and Scott
Brosius and Paul O'Neill all slumped early in the year. And still
they have the best record in baseball, after they beat the
Cleveland Indians, 9-8, in a raucous 10-inning game Friday night at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were down to their final out in the bottom of the
10th when Derek Jeter _ 0 for 5 with three strikeouts in the first
nine innings and cajoled by his anxious mother _ drove home the
tying and winning runs with a bases-loaded single off Mike Jackson,
thrilling what remained of the original crowd of 52,704. The game
lasted 4 hours 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, in his first appearance since his perfect game last
Sunday, lasted four innings, allowing six runs _ four of those
after a two-out error by Chuck Knoblauch. ``It's the type of win
that really feels good, because I had squandered the lead,'' Cone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many leads and opportunities were squandered. Roberto Alomar's
grand slam off Cone gave the Indians a 6-5 lead, and Richie Sexson
added to that with a solo shot. But the Yankees came back with two
runs in the bottom of the eighth, tying the score at 7-7 on a
two-run double by Chad Curtis _ his first hit with runners in
scoring position since May 28.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians had a runner at second in the top of the ninth and
could not score. Knoblauch reached second in the bottom of the
ninth with a walk and a stolen base, and he was stranded.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Grimsley retired the first two batters in the top of the
10th, but he walked Einar Diaz on four pitches, and Diaz stole
second. Enrique Wilson lashed a single to center and Diaz trotted
raced home with the go-ahead run. Jackson, the Cleveland closer,
jogged in from the bullpen, aiming to finish off the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But Chili Davis singled to open the 10th inning, and was
replaced by the pinch-runner Luis Sojo, who moved to second on a
sacrifice bunt. Brosius popped out, and Jackson quickly jumped
ahead in the count to Posada, one ball and two strikes; the Yankees
were one strike away from defeat. That's when Jackson lost control:
he threw three straight balls to Posada, fell behind Knoblauch
three balls and no strikes, mixed in a strike, and walked
Knoblauch, too. Bases loaded, two outs, Jeter walking to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a bad night for the Yankees' shortstop. After the
second of his three strikeouts, he made eye contact with his
mother, Dorothy Jeter, who was sitting a few rows back in the
stands with Jeter's father. Do something, she communicated to her
son. Do something.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the Yankees' dugout, manager Joe Torre tries to
imagine why good things should happen. When Knoblauch batted, he
imagined Knoblauch would get a game-tying hit, to redeem himself
for the error. Now Jeter was ready to bat, and Torre thought to
himself that Jeter's batting average had slipped under .370. ``He
needs to get back to .370,'' Torre said aloud, just as Jackson
reared back and fired his first pitch to Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter was looking for a fastball; Jackson threw him a slider,
but this stayed over the plate, and Jeter powered it to
right-center. Manny Ramirez, Cleveland's right fielder, chased the
ball and ran, but Jeter and Torre knew he had no chance. Jeter
threw a fist into the air as he rounded first, and his parents
traded high-fives as the rest of the Yankees streamed onto the
field to congratulate Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 58-37; the Indians 57-38.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians lorded over the American League for more than two
months, and for a time they played at a pace above and beyond that
of the '98 Yankees. But the rigors of the baseball season are
gnawing at the Indians: third baseman Travis Fryman tore a knee
ligament and may never return to full strength, and similarly,
there is no guarantee that catcher Sandy Alomar will rebound to
form.
</P>
<P>
   But their pitching staff is most troubling to the Indians. Jaret
Wright, once projected as a can't-miss ace because of his
96-mile-an-hour fastball, is on the disabled list with a strained
muscle and a scout who saw Wright's last start said his fastball
topped out at 89 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden has been pounded, and Dave Burba's earned run
average is close to 5.00. Now the Indians are said to be focusing
on the possible acquisition of Chuck Finley, the Anaheim
left-hander who has dominated the Yankees in the past; Cleveland
officials sat and talked Friday with Mark Langston, a former
teammate of Finley, to debrief him.
</P>
<P>
   Cone seemed somewhat anxious early, his fastball sailing high,
and walked the first batter he faced, Kenny Lofton _ so much for
back-to-back perfect games. After O'Neill banged a two-run homer in
the bottom of the first, Sexson singled to open the second _ so
much for back-to-back no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Cone hung a splitter and the rookie Russell
Branyan laced it over the right-field wall. It was going to be that
kind of game, more like a Hagler-Hearns slugfest than an artful
baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees continued to blister Tom Candiotti, the Cleveland
starter, in the second inning. Ricky Ledee doubled, Brosius drove
home Ledee with a single, and after Brosius advanced to second on a
wild pitch, Knoblauch stroked a hit and Brosius scored. O'Neill _
whose first-inning home run caromed off the facing of the upper
deck in right field _ lined a ball to right-center, where it rolled
all the way to the wall for a triple. Yankees 5, Indians 2.

   ROMAN-DEMOCRACY (Undated) _ To most historians of this century,
the Roman republic was seen as a corrupt oligarchy ruled by a rich

scholars have been nibbling away at Republican Rome's undemocratic
reputation, arguing that it was an imperfect but still recognizable
democracy. Political office was less controlled by the aristocracy
than assumed. What's more, they say, in some ways, Rome had even

penalty and pain. Persephone must return to Hades. This myth is
also at the heart of two 400-year-old operas. In the Chinese opera,
``The Peony Pavilion,'' the slightly cocky young scholar Liu
Mengmei brings his beloved back to life. And in Monteverdi's
``Orfeo,'' Orpheus, whose playing of the lyre could wring tears
from stones, uses his music to rescue his Eurydice from Hades. By

SOLE SURVIVORS LEARN TO FILL LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Now, there is only Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the
sole survivor of her immediate family, bearing the deaths of first
her father, then her mother and now her brother.
</P>
<P>
   And there is only Douglas Whitneybell.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix man, too, is the sole survivor of his immediate
family, losing first his father, then his brother and then his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitneybell has two delightful sons, ages 15 and 11, a
successful career as an architect and companionable relationships
with his ex-wife, extended family and good friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what fills my life, so I don't feel orphaned at all,''
Whitneybell, 58, said. ``If I was just out there by myself, that
would have been more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg is not alone, either. She has a
husband and three children, ages 12, 9 and 6, and a large extended
family. That is likely what will sustain her, experts on grief say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to have a support system around
you,'' said Marty Tousley, a bereavement counselor for Hospice of
the Valley, a non-profit agency that provides care and services for
terminally ill people and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg waited out the search for first her brother's plane
and then his body at her Long Island home with her husband and
children. She did not join the rest of the Kennedy clan in Hyannis
Port, Mass., where they were gathered for the wedding of Rory
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Worden, author of ``Grief Counseling and Grief
Therapy'' and director of Harvard's child bereavement study, said
Caroline _ though the death of her brother likely is devastating _
has probably revamped her definition of her ``family'' to mean her
husband and kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it was dreadful to lose her brother, it probably
is not quite as dramatic as it is made to be because she has her
kids and her husband,'' Worden said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when loved ones die suddenly and unexpectedly, it can
shatter a person's sense of security, Tousley said.
</P>
<P>
   And it likely would take longer to get over the initial grief of
yet another death after suffering so much loss, the experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   Whitneybell was 10 when his father was killed in a plane crash
in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1950, and Whitneybell remembers his mother sending him
and his brother, 5, upstairs when the base commander knocked on the
front door. This was a time of war, and everyone knew what it meant
when the officers in uniform came to your house, Whitneybell said.
</P>
<P>
   The family returned to the United States via a military
transport, and settled in Arizona, where a friend lived, and where
Whitneybell grew up without a dad.
</P>
<P>
   He did not play on a Little League team. ``I had never caught a
football, batted a bat,'' Whitneybell said, though he did run track
in high school. His mother didn't talk about the boys' father, so
they didn't either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I put it all on hold, sort of tucked it away,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitneybell was 34 when his brother, Don, killed himself. Then,
14 years ago when Whitneybell was 44, his mother died.
</P>
<P>
   Six months before she died, she told her oldest son that his
father might be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. A year after
his mother died, he visited the grave.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths, Whitneybell said, have made him a better father to
his own boys. James is now 15. Whitneybell's younger boy, Benjamin,
is 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know how long you are going to be around for your
kids, so try to really leave them with important things, and,
obviously, these are not physical things,'' he said. ``I don't
think hardly a day goes by that I don't think, `I am so glad I am
here for my sons.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When his mother died, Whitneybell put together a collage of
photographs of his parents, brother, himself and their dog, George.
</P>
<P>
   There are pictures of them on a boat to Japan, one of his father

DODGERS LOSE FOURTH STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHEONIX _ All of the feel-good thoughts from the successful post
All-Star road trip have been supplanted by what now threatens to
decimate the Los Angeles Dodgers for good.
</P>
<P>
   They were swept three games in two days by then-last place
Colorado, then came to Arizona to be obliterated by the
Diamondbacks 10-1 Friday night at Bank One Ballpark in the opener
of a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have lost four straight, but a more telling account
of what's been wrong all season was displayed in one ugly
half-inning against the Diamondbacks. It was punctuated by right
fielder Raul Mondesi spending the top of the fifth inning in the
Dodgers bullpen rather than on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield ruined the shutout with his first homer since
June 27. He led off the sixth with his 17th homer of the season,
ending a streak of 69 homerless at-bats. It was one of two hits the
Dodgers had.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, the undoing.
</P>
<P>
   That was complements of a five-run fourth inning that began when
Dodgers second baseman Eric Young failed to make the pivot and
threw wildly to first on what was a perfect double-play grounder to
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek. It was with slow-footed catcher Damian
Miller batting.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of two outs and none on, the inning digressed with
left-hander Carlos Perez misplaying pitcher Omar Daal's bunt to
load the bases. Jay Bell and Luis Gonzalez each doubled in a pair
of runs to give the Diamondbacks a 7-0 lead. Gonzalez went to third
when Mondesi's throw to second was off line and went into left
field.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks third baseman Matt Williams, who hit a two-run
homer in the first, ended the inning with an RBI single to right as
Arizona went ahead 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   After the inning ended, Mondesi opted to sit in the right-field
bullpen instead of on the Dodgers bench, re-emerging from the
bullpen for the bottom of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's frustration is no doubt a carryover of what has been
going on at the plate. He's tied for the team lead with 22 homers,
but he's hit four in the last two months, is unhappy about batting
sixth in the lineup and entered the night with a .246 batting
average. Mondesi's previous career-low is last season's .279, and
he's a career .295 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the eight runs in four innings would signal the end for
Perez. But with the Dodgers having played a doubleheader the day
before and the risk of burning out the bullpen in a rout eminent,
Perez stayed in.
</P>
<P>
   He proceeded to allow an RBI double to shortstop Edwin Diaz, the
first of his career, in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   As remarkable as it seems in what's been a lost season, Perez
reached a new low despite going six innings. He allowed a
career-high 10 runs, all of which were earned. His
already-unthinkable 6.88 ERA rose to 7.43 and he fell to 2-10. It's
the sixth time this season he's allowed at least six earned runs,
and the third time he's allowed at least seven.
</P>
<P>
   However, in an ironic twist in just how mixed up things are, it
was the first time since May 11 that Perez went six innings in
back-to-back starts.
</P>
<P>
   Daal, meanwhile, didn't allow a hit until Young singled off
Diaz's glove with one out in the fifth. He improved to 9-5 and beat
the Dodgers for the second time this season after allowing one run
on two hits in seven innings. And though Daal walked five, the
Dodgers failed to take advantage of his wildness.
</P>
<P>
   This outing came after general manager Kevin Malone said the
next five to seven days would determine the course the Dodgers
would take with the non-waiver trading deadline being a week from
today.
</P>
<P>
   A collapse, albeit one that would have to be further than the
current one, would signal time to retool and think about next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That being said, you still have to find the right match (if
you decide to trade),'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks took a 2-0 lead in the first on Williams' 24th
homer. They made it 3-0 in the third on Bell's RBI single.

DODGERS, DIAMONDBACKS SWITCH FORTUNES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A couple of years ago, if you'd asked the man on
the street to define ``Dodgers,'' you'd have been told of 21
National League pennants, reliable family ownership and a field
manager honored with a likeness on a jar of spaghetti sauce. The
Dodgers were a ballclub envied all the way from here to George
Steinbrenner's front porch.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd prevailed on that same man on the street to define
``Diamondbacks,'' you'd have heard something about venomous
rattlers indigenous to the American Southwest. The word
Diamondbacks had yet to be stitched across an athletic jersey.
</P>
<P>
   That same man _ whom we hope is off the street by now _ must be
shocked to read the baseball standings these days. The Los Angeles
Dodgers are battling for last place in the NL West. The Arizona
Diamondbacks are fighting for first.
</P>
<P>
   As the two teams began a weekend series in Phoenix on Friday
night, the Diamondbacks were eight games higher in the standings.
It could be stated almost literally that the Dodgers were lower
than a snake's belly, though not as low as a Marlin's.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to trail the Giants, descendents of Mel Ott, Carl
Hubbell and Willie Mays. Or even the Padres, pennant winners
themselves once or twice. But the Diamondbacks, who trace their
history all the way back to Andy Stankiewicz, Todd Erdos and Marty
Janzen?
</P>
<P>
   How could the Dodgers have fallen behind the Diamondbacks so
quickly, in the Arizona team's second season on the field? Viewed
from the sidewalk, it defies common sense.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that after the Dodgers were 18 games the better
team in 1998, and after the two clubs faced similar challenges
going into the winter, the Diamondbacks got the better of almost
every offseason maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, look back beyond the winter. Consider all the comings
and goings from the two clubs' rosters since early '98, when the
Diamondbacks took their first shy steps to the plate and the
Dodgers tacked up the Under New Management sign.
</P>
<P>
   Each team got a new left fielder _ the Dodgers trading with
Florida for Gary Sheffield in May '98, the D'Backs signing Luis
Gonzalez away from Detroit as a free agent in December.
</P>
<P>
   _Advantage: D'Backs. Gonzalez, a former free-swinger making his
fourth address change in as many seasons, began the week as one of
the league's top hitters at .358, on pace for 100 runs and RBI.
Sheffield, even in a solid year, hasn't matched that.
</P>
<P>
   Each team got a new center fielder _ the Dodgers signing Devon
White away from Arizona in November, the D'Backs replacing him by
signing Steve Finley away from San Diego a month later.
</P>
<P>
   _Advantage: D'Backs. Finley, fighting disk problems at 34, has
bounced back to his 28 homer-101 run form of '97. White, 36, seems
to have left his heart in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Each team got a new starting ace _ the Dodgers signing Kevin
Brown from San Diego in December, the D'Backs signing Randy Johnson
in November.
</P>
<P>
   _Advantage: D'Backs. Johnson: a major-league-high 265
strikeouts, a league-best 2.65 ERA, a 10-7 record. Brown: 10-6 but
an NL-career-high 3.78.
</P>
<P>
   Each team got one of those starters you think you can count on
for a double-figure win total _ the Dodgers trading with the Expos
for Carlos Perez at the July '98 trading deadline, the D'Backs
signing Todd Stottlemyre from Texas in November.
</P>
<P>
   _Advantage: D'Backs. Stottlemyre: four wins _ he's been on the
disabled list with a shoulder tear since May. Perez: two _ he's
perfectly healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Each team got a veteran set-up reliever _ the Dodgers signing
Alan Mills from Baltimore in November, the D'Backs signing
left-hander Greg Swindell from Boston the same week.
</P>
<P>
   Call that one even.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Dodgers got the position-for-position edge with a
couple of Tom Lasorda's and Kevin Malone's moves.
</P>
<P>
   You'd rather have bullpen closer Jeff Shaw (acquired in
Lasorda's Cincinnati trade in July '98) than 26-year-old Matt
Mantei (brought in from Florida in a desperate trade for young
pitchers by Arizona GM Joe Garagiola Jr. earlier this month).
</P>
<P>
   You'd rather have shortstop Mark Grudzielanek (with Perez in
Lasorda's Montreal trade) than Andy Fox.
</P>
<P>
   You'd rather have catcher Todd Hundley (acquired in Malone's
Mets trade in December) than the Arizona combination of Kelly
Stinnett and Damian Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, given Hundley's inability to hit the broad side of
Tony Gwynn with a throw to second base in the first half-season,
you could easily say that between the Dodgers and the D'Backs, so
far catcher has been a toss-up.
</P>
<P>
   To improve themselves, the D'backs spent a lot of free-agent
money and traded away Karim Garcia (to get Gonzalez). The Dodgers
spent a lot of free-agent money and traded away Mike Piazza and
Todd Zeile (for Sheffield and three major-leaguers no longer in Los
Angeles), Roger Cedeno and Charles Johnson (for Hundley) and at
least five promising young players (in the Shaw and Grudzielanek
deals).
</P>
<P>
   Biggest edge of all: D'backs' front office.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers could say the standings reflect the D'backs' good
luck. How could they have known Jay Bell, moved from short to
second base, would turn into a regular Davey Johnson (circa 1973)
with the bat? Or that Gonzalez would appropriate the soul of Joe
DiMaggio? Or that Finley wasn't washed up?
</P>
<P>
   True, they're partly luck, those eight games in the standings.
But wasn't it an old Dodger who said luck is the residue of design?

DODGERS MANAGEMENT FACES IMPORTANT DECISIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ General manager Kevin Malone said the upcoming week
will determine whether the Los Angeles Dodgers try to make a run at
the playoffs or begin retooling for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers opened an important three-game series with
second-place Arizona at Bank One Ballpark on Friday. Afterward,
they return home for four games with Cincinnati and three more with
the Diamondbacks. The Diamondbacks series in L.A. falls during the
July 31 non-waiver trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, no (decision has been made),'' Malone said.
``... We'll see what happens in the next five-to-seven games. That
will give us a clearer picture of what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers entered the Diamondbacks series 43-52 and 8{ games
behind San Francisco in the NL West. Malone has been hesitant to
make a trade because the team was playing well before being swept
in three games in two days by Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Still, interest is growing in right-hander Ismael Valdes, the
most marketable commodity the Dodgers have on the trading floor.
Valdes (8-8, 3.44) has been the Dodgers' most consistent starter
this season, so team officials are reluctant to make a move for the
sake of making one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, in the industry, the need clubs have is pitching,''
Malone said. ``To me, unless you can really make yourself better,
you don't make a change just to make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Valdes is moved, there is little chance the Dodgers would
get a comparable pitcher in return to fill out the rotation. That
would force them to dip into the free-agent pool during the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends ...,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``It
might be, to get to where you're trying to go, you might have to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Mark: It has become increasingly obvious the Dodgers want
to move second baseman Eric Young, though the task is arduous
because Young has two years left on his contract for a total of $9
million.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said shortstop Mark Grudzielanek could bat leadoff, if
called upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Grudzielanek's) now proven to me he could hit one or two,''
Johnson said. ``What Grud has done, since day one, is really
mentally and physically, every aspect, (work hard). He's really
been the kind of player I knew he could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Since returning July 6 from a broken hand, Grudzielanek is
batting .420. He's raised his average to .315 and has a .378
on-base percentage, second to Gary Sheffield's (.406) among
starters. By contrast, Young is hitting .263 with a .348 on-base
percentage, but it would be the fifth consecutive year his on-base
percentage has dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek spent most of his Montreal career batting leadoff.
He had a .276 average with a .308 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Feelin' fine: Todd Hundley finished serving his three-game
suspension, which also brought an end to a rigorous two days for
rookie catcher Angel Pena.
</P>
<P>
   Pena, who is hitting .429 in his past eight games, caught both
games of Thursday's doubleheader against Colorado and started
against Arizona on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired after the first game, but in the second game I
felt better and now I feel fine,'' Pena said. ``(Johnson) asked me
if I was ready to catch a doubleheader. I told him I was ready, so
they could (nix Hundley's appeal).''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: The Diamondbacks resodded their field last weekend, knowing
they would have time because of an eight-game road trip after the
All-Star break. The game with the Dodgers was their first on the
new sod.... Earlier this season, Eric Karros collected his 200th
career double. He entered Friday's game with 199 career homers.

EDITORIAL: BRINGING THE KHMER ROUGE TO JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 24:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even as some of those who committed genocide in Rwanda and
Bosnia are being brought to international justice, perpetrators of
one of history's most horrifying slaughters have escaped. Now,
however, the United Nations is moving closer to establishing a
court to try leaders of the Khmer Rouge, whose members killed more
than a million of their countrymen when they ruled Cambodia from
1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan is deciding on the details of the
court he will recommend that the U.N. support. The court will be in
Cambodia and needs the approval of Cambodia's strongman, Hun Sen.
But it must also feature effective international controls to insure
that it can do real justice and will not be manipulated by Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot is dead, but many of his
lieutenants are alive and free in Cambodia. As part of Hun Sen's
attempt to conquer the last remnants of the Khmer Rouge still
waging war from the jungle, he cut deals that effectively give the
top Khmer Rouge officials Ieng Sary, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan
immunity in exchange for their loyalty. The sole high-ranking Khmer
Rouge officer in prison, Ta Mok, earned Hun Sen's wrath because he
kept on fighting, not for what he did during Khmer Rouge rule. If
the others are not turned over for trial, the process will be a
sham.
</P>
<P>
   The structure of the court will matter. Hun Sen has used the
issue for his political gain and keeps firm control of Cambodia's
judicial system. The fairest court would have been an international
tribunal such as those for Bosnia and Rwanda. Hun Sen rejected that
idea, which led to the perception that China, which has backed him
on this issue, would veto the necessary Security Council
resolution. Anticipating such a veto, The Security Council did
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Now the U.N. will recommend some form of a Cambodian court with
international participation. If done correctly, such a court can
not only dispense justice, but also show Cambodians what fair
trials look like and demonstrate that leaders can be held
accountable.
</P>
<P>
   But Hun Sen, who has endorsed a mixed tribunal in principle, has
much opportunity for mischief. He could delay the process
indefinitely, try only his political opponents, stack the court
with his acolytes or create a show trial. The U.N. should hold out
for close Security Council supervision, and must be willing to stop
the process and disown it if it produces a whitewash. Hun Sen will
resist, but he is going along with a court largely to improve his
image abroad. Strong international pressure is needed to ensure
that Khmer Rouge trials are just.

JOHNSON PLANS CHANGES AFTER LATEST DODGERS LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It was a disaster, disgraceful, and after the latest
abomination Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said no
longer can things remain status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' fourth straight loss, a 10-1 pasting by Arizona in
the first of a three-game series at Bank One Ballpark on Friday,
was full of everything that's wrong with the club these days.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of the loss were right fielder Raul Mondesi
watching the top of the fifth from the Dodgers bullpen instead of
the bench, and a lengthy meeting between Eric Young and Johnson
afterward that could spell the end to Young's starting time at
second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to start making some changes around here
tomorrow,'' Johnson said. ``Look at a few things I think might help
our ballclub. We gave them too many outs. I'm going to start doing
a little tweaking.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the Dodgers managed just two hits. One came on left
fielder Gary Sheffield's homer to lead off the sixth. It was his
17th of the season, but first since June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Daal didn't allow a hit until Young singled off shortstop
Edwin Diaz's glove with one out in the fifth. He improved to 9-5
and beat the Dodgers for the second time this season after allowing
one run on two hits in seven innings. And though Daal walked five,
the Dodgers failed to take advantage of his wildness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand the game, you have to have knowledge of
the game,'' Sheffield said. ``You can't just go up there and hack
away. Sure, you can hit 30 homers and drive in 100 runs, but it
doesn't mean anything if it doesn't help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   But enough about the offensive ineptitude for now.
</P>
<P>
   Tops on Johnson's list of changes could be Young, who drew the
ire of teammates after failing to turn what should have been a
double play, jump-starting Arizona's five-run fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   On what was a perfect double-play grounder to shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek, Young failed to turn the double play and made an
off-target throw to first with slow-footed catcher Damian Miller
batting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was textbook,'' Grudzielanek said of the
grounder. ``What are you going to do? I don't know if he was
playing too far over. It was pretty legit. I don't know what else
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of two outs and none on, the inning digressed with
left-hander Carlos Perez misplaying Daal's bunt to load the bases.
Jay Bell and Luis Gonzalez each doubled in two runs to give the
Diamondbacks a 7-0 lead. Gonzalez went to third when Mondesi's
throw to second was off line and went into left field.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks third baseman Matt Williams, who hit a two-run
homer in the first, ended the inning with an RBI single to right as
Arizona went ahead 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have a grip on it,'' Young said. ``(It) was just
a bad game. It could have been from fatigue. It seemed like we
didn't have any jump.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the end, though. After the third out was recorded,
Mondesi opted to sit in the right-field bullpen instead of on the
Dodgers bench, re-emerging from the bullpen for the bottom of the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care where he goes if he wants to sit down,'' Johnson
said. ``It's OK for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players didn't even notice Mondesi wasn't on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't notice that, but if I was closest to it, I probably
would have done it also,'' Grudzielanek said. ``I don't know what
to say about (the Dodgers' play). It's pretty bad. Pretty bad, to
say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible move could be with starter Perez, who gave a
typical performance and did not speak afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As remarkable as it seems in what's been a lost season, Perez
reached a new low despite going six innings. He allowed a
career-high 10 runs, all of which were earned. His
already-unthinkable 6.88 ERA rose to 7.43 and he fell to 2-10. His
position in the rotation could finally be lost.

KREIGER, CROMSIGT WIN AT IRWINDALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ It was a double pleasure Friday night for
Larry Kreiger and Gerrit Cromsigt.
</P>
<P>
   Racing under Irwindale Speedway's newly formatted schedule, both
drivers won two main events before a crowd of 2,195.
</P>
<P>
   Kreiger won both 25-lap Grand American races and Cromsigt took
both 30-lap Late Model races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of work, said Grand American points leader
Kreiger, of Thousand Oaks. ``The question is how does two wins
feel, not just one. It's hard to believe. My sponsor told me to
take it easy in the first race and go all out in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Cromsigt, from Pine Mountain Club, replaced an engine and two
tires en route to his 30-lap double victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we have Brian Kelley's 100-year-old engine, he
said. ``We had the car set up really well until blowing the engine
last week, so we kept the same set-up. I think we'll run it that
way the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Bernhardt got into the right place at the right time in
the Mini Stock main event.
</P>
<P>
   The Fontana resident was running behind San Bernardino's Tony
Shreve and San Bernardino's Al Edenfield on the eighth lap. Shreve
began throwing oil, causing Edenfield to spin and Bernhardt came
out with the lead and held on to win the 20-lap main event. La
Verne's Scott Porter finished second. ``We had a tight car and a
bit of luck, Bernhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Cromsigt made up his six-point deficit on Late Model leader
Dusty McDonald, of Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald finished third in the first main and second in the
final main. They are now tied for the series points lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rip Michels of Mission Hills passed Santa Clarita's John
Watkinson for second in the Grand Am points race, but fell six more
points behind Kreiger, who leads by 48 points. Canyon Country's Rod
Johnson finished second in the first main with Michels third and
they reversed the finish in the second main.

IRWINDALE RACERS SET FOR END OF FRIDAY NIGHT RACING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Life might return to a little bit of
normalcy for Rod Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending both Friday and Saturday nights at Irwindale
Speedway, the track's most prolific driver -- he's in the Top 5 in
two divisions -- will be able to spend at least one night at his
Canyon Country home. And no more lost vacation time to go racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' the Super Late Model points leader said.
``It's hard to be here on Fridays. It frees up my Fridays so I can
spend time with my family.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to curtail the Friday-night show, which will end
after next week, came about two weeks ago, track chief operating
officer Ray Wilkings said. The track has averaged a crowd of 2,296
on Fridays, of which about half are children, and are free. Each
division will lose between four and six races under the schedule,
which was released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all drivers were in agreement with Johnson; they wish
they could race five or six more times this season, but it's too
hard to race on Friday nights and it will be better to race before
larger crowds on Saturdays. They also understood the move from a
business standpoint, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of hoping they would finish out the year,'' said
Gerrit Cromsigt, whose Late Model division has raced almost
exclusively on Fridays. ``But I think it will be a good thing all
around because I think we can get a higher car count.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Schrader, the track's competitions director, said he did
not receive one complaint from a driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying thank you, thank you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader says the move will help improve car counts and make
racing better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our car counts have been consistent, but everyone has said
that we're racing too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars aren't getting proper maintenance. Last week, the No.
85 car's (Cromsigt) motor broke and the No. 94 car's (Dusty
McDonald) valve spring broke. You know that the people in the No.
85 stayed up all night (Thursday) getting the motor in and now
they're sleepy and operating at 10 percent. We won't have drivers
who are tired, have no patience and are bound to run into others.''
</P>
<P>
   Mini Stock points leader Lee Ladd says Irwindale is his favorite
track, but he understands the dilemma facing the track; too few
cars and people in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be,'' he said about the end of the Friday nights.
``The only mistake with Fridays is that they needed help with
traffic. It's too hard to get here. I love to race this track and I
just say `thank you' for the opportunity to race on Fridays.''
</P>
<P>
   A frequent Friday night Irwindale sight were drivers arriving
after qualifying. Sometimes, the only people in the pit area was
drivers; they'd help each other unload cars.
</P>
<P>
   When Ascot first opened, the Gardena facility had Friday and
Saturday night racing, but had to discontinue the Friday night
shows because of the same problems Irwindale is experiencing. About
the only metropolis in America that currently supports Friday-night
racing is Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Late Model leader McDonald said he'd race any day of the week,
but he knows why there isn't the draw on Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect to watch baseball, basketball and football on
television in the middle of the week,'' the Simi Valley resident
said. ``They expect it be on. People think of racing and they think
of Saturdays and Sundays. They don't think of racing in the middle
of the week, or on Fridays.''
</P>
<P>
   The only disagreement in the schedule change came from some
people in the grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it,'' said Bart Yelton of Ontario, who has
attended every Irwindale event. ``I like bringing my grandchildren.
Everything's cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   But some fans understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty good for a reasonable amount of money,'' said
Arcadia resident Robert Angles, who brought his 10-year-old son,
Robbie. ``We come Saturdays, and we're disappointed they're
eliminating Fridays. We're disappointed that we don't see more
people here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkings said he knew the Friday schedule would be a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too tough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for special shows, which would require more than one
night, Wilkings says the Friday shows are history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll go back,'' he said.

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, July 25:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-RUSSIA-MOB (Washington) _ A few years ago, British
intelligence and law enforcement agencies began investigating the
money-laundering activities of Russian organized crime in Britain.
At the center of their concerns was Semyon Yukovich Mogilevich, a
man described by British authorities in one classified report as
``one of the world's top criminals, who has a personal wealth of
$100 million.'' When the British shut him down in 1995, Mogilevich
began laundering his illicit profits into a new venture: an
American company listed on the Canadian stock exchange. Current and
former American officials say Mogilevich is the harbinger of a
disturbing new trend: the Russian mobster masquerading as crack
capitalist. By Raymond Bonner. (With a graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ECONOMY (Beijing) _ China's top leaders fled the stifling
heat of Beijing this week for their annual retreat at a seaside
resort, leaving behind a city swirling with propaganda about the
crackdown against a spiritual movement known as Falun Gong. But
while the Communist Party has mounted a relentless media assault on
the group, which it outlawed on Thursday, economics rather than
politics are likely to occupy the leaders as they gather in the
tranquil resort of Beidaihe. Specifically, analysts here say they
will have to confront China's economy, which is sputtering, and a
reform effort that is in danger of stalling. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   (A photo, NYT18, moved Friday, July 23.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-GULAG-VISIT (Magadan, Russia) _ On the outskirts of town,
a former Stalinist prison stands behind a row of concrete slabs.
Undaunted by warnings from local residents who wish to remember
Stalin's horrors but are acutely aware that this is still state
property, the Chinese-American guest scrambled up the wall. The
guest, Harry Wu, a former Chinese dissident, spent 19 years in
Maoist prisons. Now that he was visiting the Russian city that was
once the center of a sprawling archipelago of sub-Arctic prison
camps, he wanted a better look. By Russell Working.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERB-DEATHS (Gracko, Yugoslavia) _ The mutilated bodies
of 14 Serbian farmers were discovered Friday night grouped around
their combine harvester in the worst single assault against the
dwindling pockets of Serb civilians left in Kosovo since NATO
troops arrived in the province last month. By Chris Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-SCHROEDER (Berlin) _ After nine months of confused
inertia in economic policy, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has at
last set out where his New Middle in politics lies _ and it is a
long way to the right of anything previously embraced by the German
leader's Social Democratic Party. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-CONSTITUTION (Caracas, Venezuela) _ The fate of South
America's longest-running, if turbulent, democracy hangs in the
balance in the vote on Sunday to select delegates to write a new
constitution _ the 27th in Venezuela's history, although the first
since 1961. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-CRIMINAL-COURT (United Nations) _ The United States is
expected to continue its campaign against politically inspired
war-crimes prosecutions at a conference about the proposed
International Criminal Court that begins Monday. By Paul Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   CZECH-GYPSY-STUDY (Prague, Czech Republic) _ According to a
study published by the European Roma Rights Center, a human rights
organization based in Budapest, Hungary, the Czech educational
system shows signs of widespread segregation and discrimination
against Gypsies. The study shows that a Gypsy child is at least 15
times more likely to be labeled mentally retarded than a Czech
pupil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL-PARKS-OVERUSE (Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.) _
Yellowstone is broken, but it is not the only national park
suffering. With the nation's 378 national park areas expected to
attract almost 300 million visitors this year after a record 286
million in 1998, many parks are deferring urgently needed capital
improvements. By Michael Janofsky. (With map and photos.)
</P>
<P>
   REM-GEORGIA-POLITICS (Athens, Ga.) _ A grassroots campaign
against a local hospital's plan to expand into surrounding
neighborhoods here has all the hallmarks of civic activism that
this college town is known for: yard signs, petitions, meetings,
protests and, of course, the support of one of the world's most
successful rock bands, R.E.M. By Tom Lassiter.
</P>
<P>
   CAPE-COD-ICECREAM (Centerville, Mass.) _ The Four Seas, a white
cottage with blue shutters and a white formica counter with 12 blue
stools, has been an institution on South Main Street of this Cape
Cod village for 65 summers. By Sara Rimer.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-BRIEFS _ Short political items from around the nation.
By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-CAMPAIGN-FUNDS (Washington) _ With George W. Bush sitting
atop a $37 million political war chest, the Democratic Party is
seeking to raise an unprecedented amount of the unregulated party
donations known as soft money, perhaps as much as $200 million by
November 2000. By Don Van Natta Jr.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE-DISPARITIES (Washington) _ New government data show
huge disparities in what Medicare pays to train doctors in
different parts of the country, with some teaching hospitals in New
York getting three or four times as much for each trainee as those
in Los Angeles or Cleveland, and seven times as much as those in
Houston. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   TAXCUT-POLITICS (Washington) _ In the midst of the bitter debate
this week over the Republican tax bills moving through Congress, it
was easy to lose sight of the emerging consensus in both parties
that there should be a tax cut this year. The question now is where
the middle ground on taxes might be _ and how the White House and
Congress can get there. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ESTATE-TAX-STUDY _ Congressional opponents of the estate tax say
it discourages savings, costs the economy more than it raises for
the government and makes it very difficult for a family-owned farm
or business to be passed to the next generation. But all of those
arguments are contradicted by government tax and economic data,
according to a new book-length study. By David Cay Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-REVIVAL (Washington) _ After his galling defeat by the
governor of Arkansas in 1992, President George Bush became
something of an outcast in his own party. At Republican functions,
speakers rattled on longingly about Ronald Reagan. But never about
Bush. It was as if Republicans had collective amnesia about the man
who led their party and the nation from 1989 to 1992. Not anymore.
By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVATE-PLANE-SAFETY (Washington) _ Each year, about 1 in 100 of
the nation's private planes have an accident, and 1 in 300 have an
accident that kills somebody. How can a traveler considering using
something other than a commercial airline spot the risky flights in
advance? By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>

<P>
   YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. _ In growing numbers that now
exceed 3.1 million a year, visitors travel here to America's oldest
national park to marvel at wildlife, towering mountains, pristine
rivers and geological curiosities like geysers, hot springs and
volcanic mud pots.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many things tourists may not see on a typical trip through
Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres spread across parts of Idaho,
Montana and Wyoming could have a greater impact on the park's
future than the growl of a grizzly or spew of Old Faithful.
</P>
<P>
   For all its beauty, Yellowstone is broken. Hordes of summer
tourists and the increasing numbers now visiting in the spring,
fall and winter are overwhelming the park's ability to accommodate
them properly.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the park's popularity has created such enormous
demands on water lines, roads and personnel that park management
has been forced to spend most of Yellowstone's annual operating
budget, about $30 million, on immediate problems rather than
investing in long-term solutions that would eliminate the
troublesome areas.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone is not the only national park suffering. With the
nation's 378 national park areas expected to attract almost 300
million visitors this year, after a record 286 million in 1998,
many parks are deferring urgently needed capital improvements.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, damaged sewage pipes at Yellowstone have let so
much ground water from spring thaws into the system that crews have
had to siphon off millions of gallons of treated water into meadows
each of the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   And with budget restraints forcing personnel cutbacks in every
department, even the number of park rangers with law-enforcement
authority has dropped, contributing to a steady increase in crime
throughout Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so frustrating,'' Michael Finley, Yellowstone's
superintendent, said. ``As the park continues to deteriorate, the
service level continues to decline. You see how many Americans
enjoy this park. They deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade the annual budget of the National Park
Service, an agency of the Interior Department, has nearly doubled,
to $1.9 billion for the fiscal year 1999 from $1.13 billion in
1990, an increase that narrowly outpaced inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But in an assessment made last year, the park service estimated
that it would cost $3.54 billion to repair maintenance problems at
national parks, monuments and wilderness areas that have been put
off _ for decades, in some cases _ because of a lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of needed repairs at Yellowstone was put at $46
million, the most of any park area in the system. But the park
service report shows that budget limits have forced virtually all
national parks to set aside big maintenance projects, delays that
many park officials say compromise visitor enjoyment and
occasionally threaten their health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., who is chairman of the Subcommittee
on National Parks, and Bob Stanton, director of the park service,
negotiated a deal last week to spend $12 million over the next
three years for Yellowstone repairs.
</P>
<P>
   But other parks may have to wait longer. The Grand Canyon
National Park depends on a water treatment system that has not been
upgraded in 30 years, a $20 million problem, park officials say.
Parts of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park
along the Potomac River are crumbling, another $10 million expense.
The Everglades National Park in South Florida needs a $15 million
water treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a heightened awareness of need among federal lawmakers
and Clinton administration officials, money to repair those
problems may be hard to find at a time when Congress is wrestling
over the true size of a projected budget surplus and how much of it
will pay for tax cuts. If billions were to become available for new
spending, the park service would still have to slug it out with
every other federal agency, and few predict that parks would emerge
as big winners.
</P>
<P>
   It is a disturbing prospect to conservationists, parks officials
and those lawmakers who support increased spending to help the
parks address their backlog of maintenance problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a decayed tooth,'' said Dave Simon, the
Southwest regional director for the National Parks and Conservation
Association, a citizens' group that is working with Yellowstone to
solve some of the long-term needs. ``If you don't take care of it,
one day you'll wake up with a mouthful of cavities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The parks' supporters like Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, who is
chairman of Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, concede
that budgetary increases as well as revenue from new programs that
allow parks to keep a greater share of entrance fees and concession
sales have been offset by inflation, rising costs and daily
operational demands that now accommodate 8.9 percent more people
than those who visited national parks a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   With few dollars available for maintenance programs, the parks
suffered ``benign neglect,'' Regula said, adding: ``It's not very
sexy to fix a sewer system or maintain a trail. You don't get
headlines for that. It would be nice to get them more money, but
we're constrained.''
</P>
<P>
   Denis Galvin, deputy director of the National Park Service,
noted that only twice this century has the federal government
authorized money for systemwide capital improvements, in the 1930s
and in 1966, and he said he was not expecting another windfall
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally,'' Galvin said, ``domestic programs come at the back
of the line when they're formulating the federal budget, and I just
don't think parks are a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no park in America reflects the array of hidden problems
more than Yellowstone, which opened in 1872, years before Idaho,
Montana and Wyoming became states. Park officials here say that the
longer problems go unattended, the more expensive and threatening
they become.
</P>
<P>
   The budget restraints have meant reducing the number of rangers
who carry guns and have the authority to make arrests. Rick
Obernesser, Yellowstone's chief ranger, said the roster had
dwindled to 112 from 144 over the last 10 years. That decline means
that the park is often left without any of these rangers from 2
a.m. to 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Obernesser said, the park will have only 93 of these
rangers, about 1 for every 23,000 acres, compared with 1 for every
15,000 acres when his staff was at peak strength.
</P>
<P>
   That has not only led to slower response times to emergencies,
like auto accidents and heart attacks, he said, but also to an
increase in crime. Since the peak staffing year of 1989, he said,
the park has experienced significant increases in the killing of
wildlife, thefts, weapons charges against visitors and violations
by snowmobile drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone's 446 miles of roads are also a constant concern.
Some of the most widely traveled routes have not been improved or
widened in almost 65 years, and many are littered with potholes so
deep that cars have broken axles. Not all roadways that snake along
mountain ledges at 10,000 feet have guard rails.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Sumeriski, acting assistant chief of maintenance at
Yellowstone, said some of the park's broken water lines are 60
years old and strained beyond reason by the growing use of bathing
facilities and toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Senior parks officials like Galvin and Finley say the
maintenance backlog has grown, in part, because of their own
inability to convince Congress that the need is critical. And in an
era when lawmakers are pressing federal agencies to operate more
efficiently, some are not convinced that senior parks officials
know how to manage their budgets and set their priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, 51, who has worked more than half his life for the park
service, conceded that management had been lax in some places. But
he said the magnitude of problems has convinced him that the time
for assigning blame is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``These parks are the goose that keeps on laying even larger
golden eggs,'' Finley said. ``All you have to do is take care of
it.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A few years ago, British intelligence and law
enforcement agencies began investigating the money-laundering
activities of Russian organized crime in Britain. At the center of
their concerns was Semyon Yukovich Mogilevich, a man described by
British authorities in one classified report as ``one of the
world's top criminals, who has a personal wealth of $100 million.''
</P>
<P>
   His money came from ``large-scale extortion, prostitution, arms
dealing and drug trafficking,'' and it was laundered through a
London bank with the help of a lawyer there, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The British shut down that operation in 1995, prompting
Mogilevich to begin laundering his illicit profits into a new
venture: a U.S. company listed on the Canadian stock exchange that
sold its stock to investors throughout North America.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former U.S. officials say Mogilevich is the
harbinger of a disturbing new trend: the Russian mobster
masquerading as master capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a new twist in how international criminals turn their
illegally obtained cash into legitimate assets.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, drug barons and those who amass mountains of cash
have laundered their money through private companies, which are
subject to less stringent reporting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But in the bull market of the 1990s, authorities say, public
companies offer criminals the chance to make even more money by
artificially pumping up the stock price and bilking investors.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilevich's move into the North American equity markets began
with a company he set up in suburban Philadelphia called YBM
Magnex. Its primary business was the manufacture of industrial
magnets at a factory in Hungary and later at a factory the company
bought in Kentucky. YBM attracted a blue-ribbon board, its books
were audited by two prominent U.S. accounting firms, it issued
glossy annual reports and it had its own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   All of this turned out to be sophisticated cover for what was
also a vast money-laundering operation, U.S. intelligence and law
enforcement officials say. They add that it is far from a unique
case and that Russian organized crime, which has acquired
devastating power in much of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union in the last decade, has made inroads in America's highly
regulated financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first public demonstration of the manipulation and
infiltration of world financial markets by Russian organized
crime,'' said a senior administration official whose
responsibilities include following Russian organized crime groups.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in a negotiated agreement, YBM pleaded guilty to
securities fraud in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. The
criminal investigation is continuing, and officials said it is
focusing on the role that Mogilevich and two associates played in
setting up and running the company.
</P>
<P>
   Like a handful of other Russian crime figures, Mogilevich is
barred from entering the United States. But he has Israeli
citizenship, as do several other prominent Russians involved in
crime, U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials believe they have shut down Mogilevich, or
at least curtailed his activities _ ``in a box,'' as a senior
intelligence official put it _ they fear that there are similar
schemes waiting to be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one case, but there are others like it throughout
the world,'' said Jim E. Moody, a retired FBI agent who headed the
organized crime section for many years and was one of the first
agents to begin working with the Russian police after the collapse
of the Soviet Union.

</P>
<P>
   In the three years between the British action and the U.S.
authorities' penetration of YBM's corporate facade, the company had
raised $114 million (Canadian) on Canada's capital markets. Helped
by glowing claims about sales and profits, YBM's stock soared, and
Mogilevich and some of his associates sold their shares for
millions of dollars in profits.
</P>
<P>
   The shares were traded in Canada, attracting some American
investors, while the company awaited approval for listing on the
Nasdaq exchange in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cloaked themselves in an air of legitimacy that was
beyond belief,'' said a former FBI official whose job included
watching Mogilevich.
</P>
<P>
   The company had sales but it also exaggerated them. It had
customers, but it also maintained fictitious customer lists.
</P>
<P>
   It paid suppliers, but some were companies controlled by
associates of Mogilevich. Some YBM officers and directors were
complicit with Mogilevich, but others thought they were engaged in
a legitimate business, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   With the investigation continuing, and a investors' class-action
suit pending _ as yet with no reply from the defendants _ there is
a general reluctance to discuss what attracted anybody to YBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be lunacy for me to say anything,'' said one former
company official.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the class action said they would
not permit their clients to talk about their investments because
they feared retaliation by Mogilevich.
</P>
<P>
   A public portrait of Mogilevich's criminal empire first appeared
in May 1998 when the New York-based weekly newspaper The Village
Voice published an article by Robert Friedman, who had access to
classified FBI and Israeli intelligence reports. After the article
appeared, Mogilevich put out a contract on Friedman's life, a
threat that was picked up during a telephone intercept by the CIA,
law enforcement and intelligence officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilevich started as a small-time thief and counterfeiter in
the 1970s, officials say, then made millions in the 1980s from Jews
leaving the Soviet Union. He took their art, jewelry and other
valuables, promising to sell them and send the money. He kept most
of the proceeds, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the Berlin wall came down and the Soviet Union
collapsed, making travel easier, Mogilevich set up operations in
Budapest, where he ran a prostitution ring out of a topless bar
called the Black and White Club, European and U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilevich, who is believed to spend most of his time these days
in Budapest and Moscow, could not be located. But a small Hungarian
newspaper reported last month that it had interviewed him (the
newspaper did not say where or how) and that he had denied any
criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a law-respecting citizen who works in
earnest and pays taxes regularly,'' Mogilevich told the newspaper,
Napi Magyarorszag.
</P>
<P>
   Though raised in a Communist society, Mogilevich, now 53,
quickly adapted the ways of fast business dealing. In putting
together YBM, he used offshore locales where secrecy prevails over
disclosure, sophisticated financial transactions and wire transfers
to move money quickly and beyond the prying eyes of regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The following account of how Mogilevich and his associates
penetrated North American capital markets is pieced together from
the information and plea agreement in the criminal case in
Philadelphia; the complaint in the class-action suit, which the
investors filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia; an audit of
YBM's books in December 1998 by a Philadelphia accounting firm,
Miller Coffey Tate, which the company hired when Canadian
securities regulators raised questions; and YBM's annual reports,
public statements and filings with regulatory agencies in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning there was a company, Arigon, which Mogilevich
set up in the Channel Islands in 1991. This was his original
conduit for laundering money, according to the British report.
</P>
<P>
   One of his partners at Arigon was his mistress, who was the
mother of a son by him, and the wife of the London lawyer who was
reportedly in league with Mogilevich, according to the British
intelligence report. (Readers of John Le Carre's latest novel,
``Single &AMP; Single,'' will find similarities between various
elements and characters and Mogilevich's escapades.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, through a series of complex transactions and
takeovers, Arigon acquired control of YBM Magnex. To finance YBM's
first public offering, in Canada, Mogilevich sent $2.4 million from
Arigon's bank accounts in the Channel Islands.
</P>
<P>
   YBM was headed by one of Mogilevich's trusted associates, Jacob
Bogatin. Bogatin, who has a doctorate in powder metallurgy from
Volgograd State University, came to the United States in the 1980s
and eventually became a citizen. From 1996 to 1998, he was
president and chief executive of YBM.
</P>
<P>
   Bogatin's lawyer in Philadelphia, Eric Sitarchuk, declined to
comment about his client, who law enforcement officials said is one
of the subjects of the continuing investigation by the U.S.
attorney in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The company's glowing claims propelled YBM's stock from a few
cents at the time of the first offering in 1994 to $5 (Canadian) in
early 1996, to more than $20 two years later.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1996 annual report, for example, the company boasted of
``record sales and earnings,'' with sales up 79 percent over the
previous year. It also claimed that revenues from buying and
selling crude oil increased from $13.6 million (Canadian) to $20.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   YBM's books were audited for 1996 by Parente, Randolph, Orlando,
Carey &AMP; Associates in Philadelphia. The firm reported that the
financial statements ``present fairly in all material respects''
the company's financial position.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, when YBM was preparing for another public
offering, Ontario securities regulators asked Deloitte &AMP; Touche to
conduct a ``high risk'' audit. In the securities world, this means
that the authorities were suspicious and wanted the accounting firm
to apply extra scrutiny and diligence.
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche gave YBM a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   One Canadian analyst who issued a ``buy'' recommendation noted
that the company had emerged from the Deloitte audit ``with flying
colors.'' And in November 1997 YBM completed a public offering of
3.2 million shares, at $16.50 (Canadian) each, bringing in a total
of nearly $53 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both accounting firms are defendants in the class-action lawsuit
by investors in YBM.
</P>
<P>
   Parente, Randolph did not respond to several phone calls asking
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Deloitte &AMP; Touche, Ellen Ringel, said that the
company had carried out the audit ``in accordance with applicable
professional standards'' and that it would ``vigorously defend''
itself against the suits. She added that in June 1998, the company
resigned as YBM's auditors after it became concerned about
``questionable transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the auditors had already missed a few things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money Laundering and Unusual Transactions'' is the heading on
a 14-page section of a 50-page report by Miller, Tate, the
accounting firm that YBM turned to hoping once again to get a clean
bill of health after Canadian officials raised question. At the
center of these transactions was a company called United Trade,
which was incorporated in the Cayman Islands and was run by Igor
Fisherman, who was also the chief operating officer of YBM.
</P>
<P>
   Fisherman, who has a master's degree in mathematics from Ufa
State University in Russia, immigrated to the United States in the
late 1980s and later became a U.S. citizen. He is also a subject of
the ongoing investigation, officials said. Fisherman's lawyer,
Peter Vaira, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, $3.2 million was transferred from a bank in
Lithuania to a United Trade account in Hungary. It was then quickly
transferred to Chemical Bank in Buffalo for the benefit of six
ostensibly different companies. At the same time, United Trade sent
money to Chemical Bank for a Buffalo lawyer, Paul F. Fallon.
</P>
<P>
   These transactions have ``several of the indicia of money
laundering,'' Miller, Tate said in its report, noting, for example,
that the companies involved in the transactions, those in
Lithuania, Hungary and the United States, all had the same address
_ that of Fallon's office in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon denied in a telephone interview that he had engaged in
any improper activity. He said that Fisherman was a client, and
that he had incorporated all of the various companies involved in
the series of wire transfers. He declined to say what business
activities these companies engaged in.
</P>
<P>
   As for the oil sales, which YBM said had done so much for its
profits, Miller, Tate found that the company never had had any oil
to sell.

DEMOCRATS AIM FOR RECORD IN UNREGULATED DONATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.J., Colo., Wis.)   (jw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.     
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With George W. Bush sitting atop a $37 million
political war chest, the Democratic Party is seeking to raise an
unprecedented amount of the unregulated party donations known as
soft money, perhaps as much as $200 million by November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials and fund-raisers conceded in
interviews that they were trying to amass a record amount of soft
money as possibly the party's only chance to close the enormous
money gap with Bush, the governor of Texas. Soft money refers to
large contributions from corporations, wealthy individuals and
labor unions that fall outside the limits of federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats' aggressive soft-money drive places the party
and its eventual nominee in a politically awkward, possibly
vulnerable position. President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey have all called on Congress
to ban soft money as part of a far-reaching overhaul of the
campaign-finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bradley, who is Gore's only rival for the Democratic
nomination, highlighted the issue confronting the party early last
week when he portrayed both Gore and Bush as hypocrites on
campaign-finance reform because they intended to rely heavily on
soft-money donations next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both reportedly have directed their top fund-raisers to begin
raising soft money to the general election,'' Bradley said.
``Before the money machine starts humming, let's pause and think
about a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are hoping to collect nearly twice as much soft money
as they did for the 1996 elections because they fear that Bush will
have millions more to spend during the nomination battle early next
year. Bush, Republican front-runner, is not constrained by federal
spending limits in the primaries because he has decided not to
accept federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is talk that they are going to beef up the
D.N.C. to raise more soft money,'' said a longtime Democratic
fund-raiser, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
``With the Bush numbers going off the chart, there is more of a
sense of urgency about the need to raise even more money sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, nearly two dozen Democratic
fund-raisers, strategists and party officials voiced concerns that
their national committee was not equipped to meet its goal of
raising $200 million. One problem, fund-raisers say, is that both
Gore and Bradley trail Bush in most national polls by wide margins.
``People want to give to the candidate they believe will win,'' one
fund-raiser said.
</P>
<P>
   The worries were expressed as the Democratic National Committee
began to play host to a summer retreat for its large donors in
Aspen, Colo., over the weekend, with the president scheduled to
attend. Clinton has also agreed to headline more fund-raising
events for the DNC as part of its soft-money drive, but
fund-raisers say his drawing power has ebbed in recent weeks
because he is perceived to be a lame duck.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Engel, the DNC's executive director, said the committee was
on track to meet its fund-raising goals. ``We are ahead of our
projections _ not far ahead, but we are ahead of what we raised in
1995,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Engel disagreed with Democratic fund-raisers who described the
party's financial situation as dire, saying he doubted that they
had been actively involved in the party's planning. In April, DNC
officials came up with a fund-raising strategy that included a
strong push for soft money, and they have not wavered from it,
Engel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we have to do to communicate our message,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the 2000 election calendar front-loaded with early contests
in expensive states such as New York and California, the Democratic
nominee could hit the primary spending ceiling of nearly $40
million or run out of money by late March.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean that in the spring and early summer next year,
Bush would still have ample money to spend, while his Democratic
challenger would be constrained from spending any money. After the
party conventions, the Republican and Democratic nominees will each
receive some $66 million in public money to run their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Although the parties' soft money is not supposed to be spent to
aid candidates directly, the federal election laws are so riddled
with loopholes that this prohibition is routinely ignored.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Democratic National Committee and the Republican
National Committee both spent tens of millions in soft money to buy
television advertising that promoted the agendas of the
Clinton-Gore ticket and Bob Dole, the Republican nominee. In 2000,
the DNC could again use soft money for so-called issue advertising
to keep the Democratic nominee afloat after his campaign runs out
of money or reaches the spending limit.
</P>
<P>
   DNC officials and leaders of Gore's campaign are hoping to
persuade Terence McAuliffe, a close friend of Clinton's and the
chairman of the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1995, to take a leadership
role in the Democratic committee, or at the very least become more
involved in the party's bid to raise large contributions from
wealthy donors.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe, who has already agreed to raise tens of millions for
the president's legal defense fund, the Clinton presidential
library and Hillary Rodham Clinton's all-but-certain Senate bid in
New York, is widely considered the best fund-raiser in the
Democratic Party. The most successful DNC fund-raising event this
year was a June 7 tribute to McAuliffe at the Washington home of
Beth Dozoretz, the committee's finance chairwoman, which raised
$3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But McAuliffe has been noncommittal about assuming an official
leadership role, committee officials say. He did not return phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., co-sponsor of the bill that would
ban soft money, said the Democratic Party should distinguish itself
from Bush's cash-flush campaign, which he said ``looks as if they
are trying to buy the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it looks ugly; the presidency should not be bought and
sold,'' Feingold said. ``I would call this a missed opportunity to
show what the Democratic Party is all about. It is supposed to be,
and I believe it can be, the party of the average person _ not of
big money interests _ and I think this disparity with George Bush
gives the Democrats the opportunity to show it. It is a very
populist message.''
</P>
<P>
   If they fail to meet their soft-money goals, the Democrats may
have no choice but to adopt the Feingold strategy. In the first six
months of 1999, the Republican National Committee raised $30
million, party officials said. The Democratic National Committee
raised $21 million, but $6 million of that came from direct-mail,
which costs 50 cents on the dollar to raise, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns of many fund-raisers, the committee
announced earlier this month that it had extinguished a stubborn,
2{-year-old debt and that it would have the resources to help elect
the Democratic nominee as president next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new day in the Democratic Party,'' the committee's
national chairman, Joe Andrew, declared on July 1. ``We now have
more cash on hand than debt, and we are on a very solid footing
heading into the 2000 elections.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic Party officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they feared that Andrew was being overly
optimistic. The committee still owes $4.8 million more, and has
about $5.5 million in the bank, leaving it with a surplus of just
under $700,000, they estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years leading up to the congressional election in
1998, the Republican Party outraised the L Democratic Party in soft
money by $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   In two years before the 1996 presidential election, the
Democrats raised $102 million in soft money, according to the
Federal Election Commission, but it had the advantage of raising
large amounts through White House coffees and Lincoln Bedroom
overnight stays.
</P>
<P>
   A large infusion of soft money early in 1995 allowed the party
to broadcast pro-Clinton issue advertisements beginning in
September 1995 all over the country, a strategy that some say was
important to the president's building an early, insurmountable lead
over Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic fund-raisers said the DNC's soft-money goals
were unrealistically lofty. As one Democratic strategist put it,
``They're going to need to raise $180 million in 15 months. It's an
impossible task.''
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said that their fund-raising efforts were
hampered the by war in Kosovo and the Columbine High School
shootings, which forced Clinton, their marquee draw, to cancel some
fund-raising events in March and April. It cost the committee an
estimated $6 million in contributions, officials said. But even
Clinton, who leaves office in less than 18 months, does not attract
as much money as he once did. Early last week, an event here, which
was attended by the president, raised $225,000, a sum that some
officials said was disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Several fund-raisers said that they were especially concerned
that Gore has $9.4 million in the bank, just $2 million more than
Bradley and more than $20 million less than Bush's cash reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't raise money for the candidate in $1,000 checks,
how can you expect someone to give you $100,000 or $250,000
checks?'' said one longtime Democratic fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley have refused to accept contributions from
political action committees. But Bush does take PAC donations, just
one of many advantages he has in the money chase.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, Gore's campaign released the names of 25
supporters who had raised at least $100,000 each. Several
fund-raisers said this caused alarm because the list did not
include some longtime fund-raisers for the party who have helped
the president.

STUDY CONTRADICTS FOES OF ESTATE TAX
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Texas, Conn., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congressional opponents of the estate tax say it discourages
savings, costs the economy more than it raises for the government
and makes it very difficult for a family-owned farm or business to
be passed to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   But all of those arguments are contradicted by government tax
and economic data, according to a book-length study that will be
published Monday in the policy magazine Tax Notes.
</P>
<P>
   The article comes after the House passed on Thursday night the
Republicans' bill to cut taxes by $792 billion, including the
repeal of the estate tax. Similar legislation was being considered
in the Senate but the outcome of the repeal is in doubt because
President Clinton has promised to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the article in Tax Notes seems likely to have a profound
effect on the debate over estate taxes, experts say. Data from
estate tax returns and other records do not support the claims of
estate tax opponents, according to the article, by Charles
Davenport and Jay Soled, professors at Rutgers University who teach
estate tax law and business management.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax is projected in the federal budget to raise about
$28 billion this year. That is less than one-third of 1 percent of
the gross domestic product, which is too slight to retard economic
growth, the authors say.
</P>
<P>
   While the tax rate on the largest estates can be 55 percent,
Internal Revenue Service data cited in the study show that in 1996
the average tax on estates of $600,000 to $1 million was 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It costs the IRS 2 cents on the dollar to administer the tax,
the authors calculate. They say the combined private and government
costs total about 7 cents on the estate tax dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport and Soled said congressional testimony by critics of
the estate tax contending that the tax costs more than it raises
was based on flawed data, including a study that estimated that
every dollar raised in federal income taxes cost the economy 65
cents more. The authors dismissed that figure as absurd.
</P>
<P>
   They also disputed another contention of the critics, that rich
people spend wildly in their later years in order to reduce estate
taxes. Instead, the authors say, many rich people save more money
to offset the tax.
</P>
<P>
   They say that the reasons family businesses are not passed to
the next generation has little to do with estate taxes. A primary
reason, the authors say, is the burden on heirs who want to keep
the business and must raise cash to pay off those heirs who do not.
</P>
<P>
   While the estate tax nominally begins when net worth at death
exceeds $650,000 ($1.3 million for a married couple), Congress lets
a couple pass on $4.5 million untaxed if they own a business and
$7.4 million if they own a farm. Only about 1 in 1,000 American
families is worth $7.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax will be paid this year by the estates of the
wealthiest 2 percent of Americans who die.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last
week that repeal of the estate tax would reduce federal revenues by
$75 billion over the next 10 years, even though the federal budget
projects the estate tax will raise more than that amount in the
next three years alone.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, who had not seen the article, said that he was
skeptical of its claims and any data drawn from IRS records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every dollar taken by the death tax is a dollar taken out of
savings when what this country needs is more private savings,''
said Archer, the author of the House Republicans' tax bill. He said
the costs of the estate tax included discouraging wealthy
foreigners from moving to the United States with their capital and
skills.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether existing exemptions are enough for farms to stay
in families, he said, ``The input from the Ag Belt is totally
contrary to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors say that among the virtues they see in the estate
tax is that it taxes some money that has slipped past the income
tax system, it is paid only by those most able to pay, it
encourages financial planning and charitable giving and it tends to
ease the trend toward concentration of wealth. The richest 1
percent of Americans now own half of all stocks, bonds and other
assets, a record level, according to Edward Wolff, a professor at
New York University.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Notes article is seen by experts as potentially as
influential as the 1994 Yale Law Review article by Edward McCaffery
of the University of Southern California Law School, who said that
liberals should join conservatives in opposing the estate tax as
inefficient and unfair. Since then, the Tax Notes article says,
``talk about the death-tax has been a monologue by the tax's
opponents.''

STUDY FINDS DISPARITIES IN AID FOR DOCTOR TRAINING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ohio, N.Y., Texas, Pa., Mass., Conn.)   (jw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New government data show huge disparities in what
Medicare pays to train doctors in different parts of the country,
with some teaching hospitals in New York getting three or four
times as much for each trainee as those in Los Angeles or
Cleveland, and seven times as much as those in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Federal health officials have known for some time that Medicare
payments for such training varied from hospital to hospital. But a
study published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine
highlights the disparities and provides more detail than had ever
been publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures come at a time when hospitals across the country
say they have been severely hurt by federal budget cuts, and
Congress is considering substantial changes in the financing of
graduate medical education, including proposals to sever the link
between Medicare and the federal support for teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital executives in New York City said the payments they
received for medical education were justified by high wage costs
and because they served large numbers of Medicare patients. But
hospital executives in California, Texas and Ohio said they saw no
justification for such large disparities because they, too, serve
large numbers of elderly patients. Moreover, they said the doctors
they produced were just as good as those trained in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The disparities, while real, are partly attributable to
accounting practices adopted years ago. Many hospitals in the
Northeast billed Medicare for faculty time, while elsewhere,
hospitals covered that cost in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   The study in The New England Journal presents data from the
Health Care Financing Administration, the federal agency that runs
Medicare. At the top of the list, it shows that Beth Israel Medical
Center in Manhattan has received an average Medicare payment of
$57,010 a year for each resident it trains, while Montefiore
Medical Center in the Bronx has received an average of $55,073.
Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia also received
relatively high payments, averaging $44,355 for each resident.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Medicare payments for graduate medical
education averaged $29,843 for each resident at Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston; $24,444 at Columbia-Presbyterian
Medical Center in Manhattan; $17,055 at Yale-New Haven Hospital;
$16,518 at the Cleveland Clinic Hospital, and $11,908 at the
University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hermann Hospital in Houston, a major teaching hospital for the
University of Texas, received an average of $6,938 for each
resident.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who has authority over Medicare as
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said, ``Clearly there are
inequities in the financing of graduate medical education.'' But to
date he has not endorsed any specific remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's primary mission is to finance health care for the
elderly and disabled, but the program has also become the main
vehicle for federal aid to teaching hospitals, providing some $7
billion annually. About a third of that money helps pay the direct
costs of medical education, including salaries and benefits for
doctors in training and their instructors, as well as a share of
hospital overhead costs.
</P>
<P>
   New York hospitals fear they could be harmed by any changes in
Medicare's complex formula for subsidizing medical education. Some
academic leaders in other parts of the country said they wanted to
increase their own payments without necessarily cutting New York's.
But that would require additional money.
</P>
<P>
   John Iglehart, a health policy expert who compiled the data,
said, ``The payments vary substantially, even in New York, because
of differences in the way teaching hospitals accounted for the
costs of residency training'' in 1984, the year used as a starting
point to compute payments for graduate medical education.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Nickelson, director of government relations for the
Cleveland Clinic Foundation, said: ``We had never billed Medicare
for faculty time _ doctors teaching residents in the hospital,
working with them on clinical research _ so the cost did not show
up in our Medicare cost report for 1984.''
</P>
<P>
   David Langness, a spokesman for the University of California at
Los Angeles, said: ``We want to find a way to achieve some parity.
Our costs are in the same league as the East Coast universities',
but we get paid a great deal less.''
</P>
<P>
   Langness said the five medical schools in the University of
California system would send top executives to Washington this week
to urge Congress to ``raise the payments to teaching hospitals that
have historically been underpaid.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jim Mandler, a spokesman for Beth Israel Medical Center in New
York, said the president of the hospital, Dr. Matthew Fink, had
reviewed the data in The New England Journal and had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Spencer Foreman, president of Montefiore Medical Center,
said the disparities in Medicare payments, were rooted in the
different ways that medical education was financed in different
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are legitimate costs,'' Dr. Foreman said. ``They have
been audited repeatedly. It's not cheaper to train a resident on
the West Coast than on the East Coast. But there's a difference in
how the costs are borne. In the older teaching hospitals of the
Northeast, the costs have been borne, to a large degree, by the
hospital. In California, the state government and the medical
schools have paid more of the faculty costs.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the California teaching hospitals, like Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles, are not affiliated with the state
university. Medicare payments at Cedars-Sinai average $19,479 for
each resident, which is 35 percent of the average at Montefiore.
</P>
<P>
   Montefiore officials estimate that 40 percent of their Medicare
payments go toward residents' salaries, while 30 percent go toward
faculty costs and the rest for overhead costs like classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shlomo Melmed, senior vice president of Cedars-Sinai, said:
``We are a private hospital. We don't get any state subsidy for our
medical education program. We have to pay 100 percent of the costs
that are not covered by federal Medicare payments.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, members of Congress from both parties have
suggested gradually reducing the disparities, so Medicare payments
for each resident would be closer to the national average. Dr.
Foreman said, ``That would kill some institutions like Montefiore
and would create windfalls for other places that have a lot of
state support.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's top leaders fled the stifling heat of Beijing
last week for their annual retreat at a seaside resort, leaving
behind a city swirling with propaganda about the crackdown on a
spiritual movement known as Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Communist Party has mounted a relentless media
assault on the group, which it outlawed on Thursday, economics
rather than politics are likely to occupy the leaders as they
gather in the tranquil resort of Beidaihe. Specifically, analysts
here say they will have to confront China's economy, which is
sputtering, and a reform effort that is in danger of stalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attack on Falun Gong comes at a time when they have so
much more to worry about,'' a party functionary in Beijing said.
``We should be concerned about developing the economy. There's a
risk that this will distract everyone's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Beijing must figure out how to rebuild the
confidence of battered Chinese consumers. For 21 consecutive
months, consumer prices in China have fallen. That is because, in
economic terms, China is in a deflationary spiral, which means that
consumers who are worried about their futures have stopped buying
things.
</P>
<P>
   The deflation has been aggravated by a huge glut in production
capacity. Too many factories are making too many goods, a lot of
which do not appeal to China's jaded shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very worrying set of circumstances,'' said T.L. Tsim,
an independent consultant on Chinese politics and economics in Hong
Kong. ``Once deflation takes hold, it is very hard to shake off.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsim said the downward spiral in prices had slowed China's
once-torrid economic growth and could hobble it further. It could
also derail the radical reforms of China's bloated state-owned
industries that Prime Minister Zhu Rongji announced with much
fanfare in the spring of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although China said its economy grew 7.8 percent last year,
economists say the real figure was closer to 4 percent. Even the
official estimates confirm that growth has slowed each year since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining robust growth is crucial in China because with a
population of 1.3 billion that expands at 1 percent a year, the
country must add at least 7.5 million jobs a year just to absorb
the people entering the labor force. And that does nothing to
alleviate the existing unemployment rate, which economists estimate
at 10 percent in urban areas and 30 percent in the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's reform of state industries will necessitate closing down
hundreds of inefficient state-owned companies, which could throw
millions of workers on the streets. The prospect of these layoffs _
in addition to a loss of benefits and subsidies as Beijing
dismantles its Communist welfare state _ has left many Chinese
people deeply insecure about their future.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to have very little money in their pockets, but
most things were allocated by the government,'' said Ding Junfa,
deputy director of the state Administration for Domestic Trade.
``Now people's expectations are changing. They are putting money
aside.''
</P>
<P>
   The flowering of spiritual movements in such an atmosphere is
not surprising. The popular discontent that flows from a torpid
economy supplies the kindling for groups like Falun Gong, whose
followers draw solace from a blend of Buddhism, Taoism and
breathing exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The government apparently reacted so strongly to the unexpected
emergence of Falun Gong in April because it recognized the group's
success as a symptom of a deeper social and economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons Chinese people flock to these sects, of
course _ not the least that after two decades of a more open
society, the Communist Party's values no longer seem particularly
relevant to many Chinese. But at least some analysts said that
people's fear of economic upheaval appears to be one driving
motivation for turning to such groups now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Mao Tse-tung, people felt everything was handed to them.
There was no competition,'' said Dai Qing, a commentator in
Beijing. ``Since the Deng Xiaoping era, there has been more and
more competition. People feel they have no control over their
future, especially older people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dai said one reason Falun Gong thrives is that it promises
to improve the health of practitioners by harnessing traditional
Chinese breathing and meditation exercises, known as qigong. Such
remedies may provide some comfort at a time when the state no
longer provides free health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays people have to pay 70, 80, 90 percent of their
medical expenses,'' Ms. Dai said. ``But many people find it
impossible to pay such large costs, so they turn to other ways of
staying fit and healing themselves. That's why Falun Gong and other
types of qigong have so many adherents.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those seeking spiritual nourishment, people are
expressing their insecurities in a more tangible way: They are
stashing their paychecks in the bank. The savings rate in China is
roughly 42 percent of household income, one of the highest in the
world. And it is rising as consumer spending weakens.
</P>
<P>
   By Western standards, consumer spending in China still looks
fine. For a rapidly-developing country, though, the trend is
disturbing. Officials said the growth in consumer spending had
tapered off steadily in recent years, from 10.2 percent in 1997 to
6.8 percent in 1998 and 6.4 percent in the first half of this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the new parsimony _ and abundant overconstruction of
new stores _abounds at the glittering shopping malls that line
Beijing's Changan Avenue. At the Henderson Center, a multilevel
temple to consumerism that opened last year, a mere handful of
shoppers drifted past boutiques that trumpeted clearance sales the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Taochun hurried past the stores. ``I'm like everyone
else,'' said Wang, a 24-year-old clerk at a computer firm. ``How
much I spend depends on how much I earn. Right now, I'm not earning
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A similar scene unfolded at a nearby department store. Although
color television sets were selling at deep discounts, a sales clerk
confided that she would be lucky to sell one a day. Last year, she
said, she was selling eight a day. Next to the showroom, boxes of
new sets were stacked up three deep.
</P>
<P>
   A 65-year-old retired doctor who would give only his surname,
Zhou, peered at a set that was selling at a 25 percent discount.
``I think the price is going to go down even further,'' he said,
``so I'm going to wait a while before I buy anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhou says he is more likely than younger consumers to replace
his television set because he is living on a reliable pension.
Young people, he says, have to weigh major purchases carefully
because neither their jobs nor their pensions are secure.
</P>
<P>
   The oversupply of television sets in China has set off such a
price war that eight manufacturers of television tubes recently
agreed to suspend operations for two months to reduce their
stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a vicious cycle of lower and lower prices and less
and less in profits,'' said a sales manager at one of the
manufacturers. ``We hope this will have some effect, but it's going
to take a long time to solve the basic problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The most intractable problem is that there are simply too many
factories churning out everything from refrigerators to air
conditioners to cars. Camera factories, for example, are operating
at less than 20 percent of capacity, according to government
statistics. Even companies that produce China's once-ubiquitous
mode of transportation, the bicycle, are running at no more than
half their capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The glut of capacity is a result of the foreign money that
poured into China in the mid-1990s, leading the economy to grow at
a furious pace. Many of those dollars flowed into hapless ventures
or speculative schemes that are now losing money. One of China's
largest state-owned companies, Guangdong International Trust and
Investment Co., declared bankruptcy in October, leaving dozens of
foreign banks holding bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists contend there is little the government can do to
ease price deflation, since it is caused as much by the surfeit of
supply as by the lack of demand.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Beijing has focused on reviving consumer demand. It
has plowed billions of dollars into vast infrastructure projects,
cut interest rates, announced plans to raise salaries of civil
servants by 30 percent and introduced tax credits to promote
exports.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the efforts have taken on an air of
desperation. The state is encouraging more families to send their
children to private colleges so that the parents will dig into
their pockets for tuition. And last month, it began singing the
virtues of investing in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, promoted in official publications, prompted a
flood of purchases, which drove up China's two main stock
exchanges, Shanghai and Shenzhen. The shares promptly plummeted
after Taiwan and China began a bitter row over defiant remarks by
Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking up the market was extremely risky,'' said Shawn Xu,
chief of research at China International Capital Corp. ``Investors
may hold the government responsible if the market crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other economists, Xu said China could stimulate consumer
demand only by supporting its private sector. To do that, he said,
the government must overhaul its debt-ridden state banks and open
its capital markets, which are still off limits to many private
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that this is no easy task. Two decades after
Deng Xiaoping began transforming China from a planned economy to a
market economy, the country is entering the most painful and
perilous chapter of its transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zhu Rongji is dealing with the things that Deng Xiaoping
didn't want to deal with,'' said Andy Xie, an economist at Morgan
Stanley, Dean Witter in Hong Kong. ``That's why this is so
difficult.''

<P>
   GRACKO, Yugoslavia _ The mutilated bodies of 14 Serbian farmers
were discovered Friday night near their combine harvester in the
worst single assault against the dwindling pockets of Serbian
civilians left in Kosovo since NATO troops arrived in the province
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The killings, in which several of the men appeared to have been
disfigured with blunt instruments, seemed likely to undermine still
further the effort by the international community to keep the
Serbian minority from fleeing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80,000 of the estimated 200,000 Serbs living in Kosovo
when NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia ended have left since alliance
troops arrived in mid-June. The soldiers have proved so far
powerless to stop what Kosovo Serbs say is daily harassment, with
repeated rumors of kidnappings and killings. The discovery of the
bodies seems certain to accelerate the exodus.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials, who have promised to track down the attackers,
and senior Kosovo Liberation Army leaders, who denied involvement
in the attacks, on Saturday condemned the killings. The rebel army
of Kosovo Albanians waged a guerrilla war against Serbian forces
for a year, but has since called for Serbian civilians to remain in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, the U.N. transitional administrator for
Kosovo, called the killings ``inhumane and senseless'' and vowed
that the gunmen would be apprehended and brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   British Special Investigations Branch officers sealed off the
site and were combing the field for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The village of Gracko, centered on a rectangular green, was
muted and still on Saturday. Groups of women, all wearing
kerchiefs, black skirts and shawls, along with men in ill-fitting
suits, walked in hushed clusters to pay their condolences to
distraught families. Dust was kicked up on their shoes or rubber
boots as they passed flocks of geese and chickens.
</P>
<P>
   The forlorn troupes pushed open wooden fences and entered yards
outside simple stucco or red cinder block homes. They sat on
blanket-covered planks placed on the tops of cinder blocks, sipped
coffee in chipped demitasse cups or downed shots of clear-colored
local brandy. They said what they had come to say, most not able to
speak above a whisper, and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   The killings had all the hallmarks of a premeditated ambush,
British investigators said. The Serbian farmers, who were
harvesting wheat in a field about a mile from Gracko, were slain
swiftly in bursts of automatic fire that came from several
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gracko, a village of some 300 people, is predominantly
Serbian, the surrounding villages are Albanian. Villagers said
Saturday that harassment and threats are a daily occurrence. They
said that an elderly man was kidnapped while riding his bicycle a
few days ago and has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Serbs now in Gracko have already fled from other
villages, where they had lived among Albanians. Most of these
farmers said they have lost everything they owned. No Serb ventures
out of Gracko, villagers said, even for food and supplies, unless
traveling in a convoy of vehicles. At night, the villagers shutter
themselves inside their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving in Kosovo, the NATO-led force has detained 200
people, nearly all Albanians, for violent crimes, including murder,
arson and looting against the Serbian minority. On July 6,
according to two officers with the NATO force, systematic burning
of Serbian homes began, often preceded by organized looting, and
security has deteriorated further for the Serbs.

</P>
<P>
   Canadian and British troops, part of the 36,500 NATO
peacekeepers in the province, moved slowly throughout Gracko
Saturday in six-wheeled armored personal carriers, their great
green vehicles belching clouds of diesel smoke. Canadian or British
flags, mounted on the sterns, whipped out in the light breeze.
Sheets of gray clouds obscured the sunlight and left the air thick
with moisture.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO spokesman said British troops were on a routine patrol
near the village, which is six miles south of the provincial
capital, Pristina, when they heard automatic fire. A British Rapid
Reaction Unit arrived 40 minutes later, and at around 10 p.m.
Friday discovered the bodies of 13 male farmers lying around their
combine harvester.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harvester was still running,'' said Maj. Ian Seraph of
Britain. ``About five minutes later they found another body on top
of a tractor. They were all killed in a most horrible and gruesome
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Dostana Stojanovic, who fled with her husband, Nikola, from a
nearby village six weeks ago to live with one of her sons, said she
knew something was terribly wrong when she heard gunfire. Her
husband, 63, had gone to the fields to help his neighbors harvest
wheat. The volleys came from that direction, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have a car and could not go check,'' she said,
standing in a dirt yard next to a shed made of stripped branches
and patched with mud and loam. ``I sent one of my sons to call
KFOR,'' she said, using the acronym for the NATO-led force. ``He
called five or six times before they came. We are all frightened.
We hear shots every night. We see houses go up in flames. We have
no protection.''
</P>
<P>
   British troops who were at the site of the killings called the
scene disturbing. The killers, not content with gunning down their
victims, had run over some with the farm vehicles and repeatedly
thrust blunt objects into the faces to disfigure them, according to
Serbs who viewed the bodies later.
</P>
<P>
   When relatives went to the Pristina Hospital Saturday morning to
identify the bodies, the British soldiers told them to enter the
room in pairs. They warned them that it would be hard to recognize
their family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people lying there who I have known all my life,
but who I could not identify,'' said Milivoje Arsic, 45, who is
Mrs. Stojanovic's son-in-law and who agreed to view her husband's
remains. ``There were puncture wounds in the necks, perhaps from
screwdrivers, and the faces had been badly maimed. My father-in-law
was hard to recognize because of all the blood and disfigurement.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings seemed for many the final blow in the flagging
effort to hang onto villages and homes. In Gracko Saturday, several
residents told stories of beatings, knifings, flights from villages
where Serbs can no longer reside or open threats. No one seemed
surprised by the attack.
</P>
<P>
   One of the mourners, Dusan Mladinovic, 42, has a scabrous red
line across his face that he says he received from an Albanian who
attacked him with a knife three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was forced out of my village of Donje Godance three days ago
and am here with my cousin,'' said Djordje Stolic, 66. ``Albanians
in uniform, not from our village, came and took my house, my car
and my farm equipment. But I do not care about that now. Two weeks
ago, they took away my son Mica who is only 18. Neighbors tell me
he is being held in a KLA jail in the village of Petrovo. I only
want him home, then I will leave Kosovo as they wish.''
</P>
<P>
   The village of Petrovo, 10 miles from Gracko, is emptied of
Serbs. The scorched and gutted shells of homes dot the roadside. A
mosque, with a silver-painted dome, has several large gaping shell
holes, left either from last year's fighting when the Serbian
police battled guerrillas, or from the Serbs' assault on Albanian
settlements during NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian rebel force, despite the disarmament agreement that
forbids fighters to carry automatic weapons, had uniformed soldiers
with AK-47 assault rifles stationed Saturday around a small school
that it uses as a local headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters said they knew nothing of kidnapped Serbs. In a
scene reminiscent of Serbian security forces who denied any crimes
against Albanians, they said their side had done no wrong. ``This
story of 14 Serbs being killed is a lie,'' said one officer, who
would not give his name. ``Serbs are not being killed here. Only
the Serbs murder innocent men and women.''

BUTTERFLIES MAKE COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the deserted dunes just west of Los Angeles
International Airport, where crumbling foundations of homes testify
to past expansions, nature has made a startlingly beautiful
comeback _ with the help of millions of public dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The endangered El Segundo blue butterflies that two decades ago
numbered fewer than 500 have multiplied to more than 80,000 today,
turning the 200 acres of airport habitat into the world's largest
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   The cultivation of the butterflies, or (begin ital)Euphilotes
battoides allyni(end ital), has not been without cost or a mixture
of motives, however.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles World Airports has spent millions to foster the
delicate and finicky insects that grow to thumbnail size on a diet
of coastal buckwheat before expiring in a few days during the
mating season that runs from about mid-June through mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   The airport runs a buckwheat nursery on the premises and has
installed an extensive sprinkler system to make sure the plants
thrive once they are transplanted.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Crowther, the airport's environmental manager, estimates
it costs the airport about $250,000 a year _ or about $3.20 a
butterfly _ for an environmental consulting firm, airport staff and
gardeners to groom the dunes for invasive plants that threaten the
buckwheat, in particular ice plants and acacias.
</P>
<P>
   The airport is voluntarily making the expenditures in hopes that
some day the El Segundo blues _ named after the male's
purplish-blue wings _ will become numerous enough to be removed
from the federal government's list of endangered species. That
would lift some of the constraints airport officials now face in
going onto the dunes to fix or relocate airport navigational
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's ultimate goal is to get them delisted,'' Crowther
said. ``The preserve would remain, but it would be easier for us to
work out here.''
</P>
<P>
   The El Segundo blues won't affect LAX's proposed $12 billion
expansion, however, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Carol Gorbics said the
airport has run an excellent program. But she said that before the
butterflies can be relisted in the less restrictive ``threatened''
category, more years of progress will have to be documented and
three other, smaller habitats outside the airport's jurisdiction
will also have to show gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the airport dunes are close to achieving these things,
we still have to ensure that the other populations are exhibiting
the same trends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The El Segundo blues' habitat runs roughly from Palos Verdes to
the Ballona Wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Fenced off from the public, the airport's preserve is the
providence of scientists and surveyors with now-and-then signs of
animal life, including rare sightings of the red fox.
</P>
<P>
   The surveyors await the hatching of the pupae, which spend most
of the year burrowed into the soil or leaf litter, then try to do a
visual count as the insects zip about the white and pink buckwheat
flowerheads.
</P>
<P>
   Though the butterflies usually don't stray more than a few
hundred feet from their birthplace before they die, they move so
quickly it's almost impossible not to double-count some and to miss
others, said Andrew Huang, the airport scientist overseeing the
butterfly project.
</P>
<P>
   The female butterfly is less garish, with only a subtle orange
stripe marking her brownish wings. She lays up to 120 eggs before
expiring, often devoured by crab or lynx spiders.
</P>
<P>
   Huang said more studies are needed to better determine exactly
how the El Segundo blues, one of six subspecies of the more
abundant San Bernardino blues, differ genetically, as well as to
explore whether they can survive on a wider variety of plant food _
issues that could bear on a delisting decision.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the studies on blues in general have been funded by
former Chicago White Sox owner Arthur C. Allyn, a butterfly
enthusiast, for whom the subspecies (begin ital)allyni(end ital) is
named.
</P>
<P>
   Huang said the anticipated studies also will help the airport
better manage the preserve.

<P>
   Like most California gun shop owners, Louis Baldridge complains
about the law that Gov. Gray Davis signed July 19. ``People see
that the state government has overstepped itself,'' he says of the
restrictions on assault weapons, and he welcomes talk of a ballot
initiative that might repeal them.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Baldridge finds himself complaining all the way
to the bank. However objectionable, he says, the law has
``definitely increased business'' at his shop in El Cajon, near San
Diego, as customers rush to purchase assault weapons before it
takes effect Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar, if perverse, syndrome: Concern about gun
violence stirs legislative interest in gun control; the ensuing
controversy energizes demand for guns among people who fear they
may soon disappear from stores. Manufacturers and distributors then
build up inventories to handle the new business.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, measures that eventually pass are deeply compromised;
the result is a net increase in gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the tragedy of ineffective laws,'' observes Tom Diaz,
author of ``Making a Killing,'' (The New Press, 1999) a tough new
analysis of the firearms industry. ``You have the run-up in sales,
then you have a law that doesn't deal with the problem. People get
jaded, disillusioned with gun control.'' Such disillusionment has
prompted cities to sue firearms manufacturers in hopes of achieving
more effective gun control through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz and others point to the 1994 federal law that banned an
array of assault weapons by name and those with design features
distinguishing them for military use; it also banned magazines
holding 10 rounds or more. But it exempted existing weapons in
legal hands nationwide before Sept. 13, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Two researchers at the Urban Institute, Jeffrey A. Roth and
Christopher S. Koper, found that prices of guns and magazines
subject to the ban rose 50 percent or more, in some cases doubling,
as the bill was being debated in 1993 and 1994, then declined after
the bill passed. Prices of other guns remained stable during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Roth and Koper also found that manufacturers boosted production
to take advantage of surging demand and premium prices. Output of
five banned models remained steady at about 91,000 guns per year
from 1989 to 1993, then more than doubled to about 204,000 in 1994.
During the same period, annual production of certain unbanned guns
fell from an average of 283,000 to 184,000.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz reports that high-capacity magazine producers not only
stepped up production and hoarded inventories as the law headed for
passage; they also negotiated trade-ins of guns used by police and
other law enforcement agencies, thereby obtaining many pre-ban
magazines that remained perfectly legal to sell on the civilian
market.
</P>
<P>
   The new California assault weapons law reflects the failures of
a state law passed in 1989. That law banned sales of assault
weapons by name and empowered the state attorney general to add
similar new guns to the list, subject to court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers responded with cosmetic changes and new names for
guns, but when the attorney general asked the court to add one of
these ``copycat'' weapons to the banned list, judges questioned
giving courts the power to ban guns. The issue remains on appeal,
and the post-ban assault weapons continue to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of gun control are more hopeful about the measure
enacted last week. Rather than relying on a list of names and
models, it bans the manufacture, sale or other transfer of any gun
with one or more of the characteristics that define assault
weapons, like pistol grips and barrel shrouds. The new law also
exempts such guns now legally owned and requires their
registration.
</P>
<P>
   But it forbids their sale or transfer, even as part of an
estate. When an owner dies, the banned gun will have to be shipped
out of California, destroyed or turned in to the police. ``In one
generation, all these weapons will be gone'' from the state,
predicts Louis Tolley of the California office of Handgun Control
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such confidence is justified remains to be seen,
however, given gun makers' ingenuity. In his book, Diaz documents
industry pride in ``rule-beating'' guns that appeared after the
1989 California law, the 1994 Federal law and other local measures.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Helsley, the Nation Rifle Association's liaison for the
state, ridicules the law's attempt to base a ban on design
features, noting its reference to ``a pistol grip that protrudes
conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict that by the first of the year, there will be a
`California grip,' which will allow everyone to do a part swap'' _
exchanging a removable illegal grip with a legal one for purposes
of compliance. As part of his campaign against the law, he
distributed illustrated instructions for such a modification.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters of the law argue that it remains a positive step
despite the sales surge and the chance for new evasions of its
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Garen Wintemute, a California emergency room physician who
also researches gun issues, points out that pre-ban increases in
gun sales tend to be short-lived. The Roth-Koper study, for
example, found that assault weapons sales plunged and prices fell
after 1994 ``apparently under the combined weight of preban
overproduction of grandfathered guns and the introduction of new
legal substitute guns at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wintemute also notes that while sales may have increased before
the 1989 California ban and the 1994 federal ban, the proliferation
caused no detectable increase in crime and may have reduced it.
Roth and Koper calculate that the 1994 law contributed to a decline
in the nation's murder rate in 1995. The researchers speculate that
most of the customers who drive up sales before a ban are
collectors and speculators rather than criminals; their rush to
acquire assault weapons may even divert them from the criminal
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what the impact is on production,'' Wintemute
concludes. ``My interest is in the impact of bans generally on the
incidence of violence.'' But it's still an open question whether
guns acquired by collectors and speculators will eventually find
their way into criminal hands.
</P>
<P>
   California, in any case, is once again the laboratory for ban
research: Despite hoopla over its signing last week, the new law
doesn't take effect until Jan. 1. As a result, manufacturers and
distributors have another five months to sell as many assault
weapons as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer is saying, `Get it now because you won't be able
to get it again,''' declares Baldridge, the El Cajon dealer. ``The
more they go after guns, the more people buy them.''

   LOS ANGELES: in terms of gender.
</P>
<P>
   At CSUN, 59 percent of the students are women, meaning that,
under the agreement, 54 percent of athletics resources must be
earmarked for women.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge has improved markedly, offering the NCAA-maximum
scholarships in many of its women's sports. It has also added
women's soccer and women's golf in recent years. Northridge is
spending $827,410 on women's scholarships and, excluding football,
only 45percent of that ($354,382) on men's scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Most of CSUN's men's sports are operating on a shoestring. The
men's soccer team, for example, operates on $84,000. The women's
soccer team has $198,000. Likewise, the men's volleyball team has
$126,000 to the women's $282,000.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many of the men's teams have little chance to be
competitive at a national level.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its efforts, though, CSUN remains out of compliance with
the Cal-NOW agreement. The problem is, there is no female
equivalent to football and its 50 to 60 scholarships and large
staff of specialized coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating football would immediately solve the gender-equity
dilemma while allowing Northridge to pump up its remaining men's
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a model for schools without football,'' Fullerton's
Franks said. ``(Dropping football) certainly made it easier. We
have been at the forefront of compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't just the remaining men's sports that benefit. While
Fullerton softball coach Judi Garman said her program received an
extra $30,000 after football was axed, the real payoff came from
greater access to support services. Without football, Garman's
players had an easier time using the training rooms, securing
academic advisement and using meeting rooms. Plus, Garman hired a
new assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   When Fullerton had football, it had trouble attracting fans even
in the best of times. The Titans finished 1984 with an 11-1 record
and were ranked 19th in the final United Press International poll.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, it drew just 6,000 to its home opener.
</P>
<P>
   Since dropping football, both Fullerton and Long Beach have made
regular appearances in the baseball College World Series, and
Fullerton has won it. Both also rebuilt their baseball stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Beach volleyball programs have thrived. The women went
undefeated in 1998 and won the national championship. The men
reached this past spring's final.
</P>
<P>
   Malibu's Pepperdine University, a private school, also has
fielded a top-notch Division I athletics program despite the lack
of football since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, the baseball (1992), men's volleyball (1992),
men's golf (1997) and men's water polo teams (1997) have won
national championships.
</P>
<P>
   And Pepperdine does this with an operating budget of just
$995,000 for 14 sports. By contrast, Northridge's operating budget
is $2,233,381 for 20 sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply could not afford to have a quality football team, so
we started focusing on the sports that we think could do well,''
Pepperdine athletic director John Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has had only modest success in recent years, with several
conference titles and an appearance in the 1993 championship game
by the men's volleyball team.
</P>
<P>
   Former and present players say it is easier to recruit excellent
athletes with excellent facilities and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program's too good (to be neglected),'' said Rob
Crabtree, a minor-league baseball player who played at Northridge
in 1995-96. ``They should do something. Then you'll get teams
coming in instead of us going to Texas to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge officials know they can't have it all. While
officials have acknowledged discussing eliminating football, no one
appears to have the will or political standing to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Former athletic director Paul Bubb and his boss, vice president
Ron Kopita, made the decision two years ago to cut four men's
sports and keep football in order to meet financial and
gender-equity goals. Ultimately, both were forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Most athletes and alumni want to see football continue, and Dick
Dull _ the new athletic director _ said the school benefits from it
with improved fund-raising and increased exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like it or not, the public appetite is men's basketball and
football,'' Dull said. ``When you drop one of them, the attention

GRIDIRON'S FAILURE MAY BOOST OTHER SPORTS

BY LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- California State University, Northridge,
officials insist the school will field a football team in 2000 and
raise enough money from the community to build a stadium and put
the program on solid financial footing in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after going through three coaches in four years and in the
midst of an embarrassing investigation of a program that devours
nearly a quarter of the school's intercollegiate sports budget,
football at CSUN is in trouble and may inevitably be dropped just
as it has at so many similar colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Acting President Louanne Kennedy believes CSUN committed
``serious and substantial'' violations of National Collegiate
Athletic Association and university rules _ which she intends to
make public in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the school has fired head coach Ron Ponciano and
pressured offensive coordinator Rob Phenicie to resign. Jeff
Kearin, hired as an interim replacement on Thursday, becomes the
fourth head coach since 1996. He has a six-month contract.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason why CSUN would eliminate football is that
it makes the most sense for an athletics program that can't afford
the sports it has, doesn't have a realistic hope of building modern
facilities for all of them, is struggling to meet gender-equity
requirements and is just one downturn of the economy away from
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The San Fernando Valley has the feeling,'' said Mike Bird, a
Northridge graduate and former volleyball player, ``that if it
wants to watch big-time, Division I football, they're going to go
to USC or UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge fields 20 intercollegiate sports teams and, in
1998-99, is spending $6.8million to pay for them _ about $4million
going directly for programs. Of that, football costs Northridge
just under $1million annually.
</P>
<P>
   The disproportionate costs of football and the men's
scholarships it requires are major reasons that none of the five
other California State University campuses in Los Angeles and
Orange counties has a football team. In fact, none offers as many
sports as CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Beach and Fullerton campuses _ similar institutions as
CSUN with athletics budgets about the same size _ both dropped
football this decade. They refocused their money and support staff
on other sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't play Division I football economically,'' CSU
Fullerton sports information director Mel Franks said. ``In this
market, USC and UCLA don't sell out, unless they're playing each
other. The pros have bailed out of here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge intends to build a modern football facility to
replace North Campus Stadium, decrepit and woefully below standards
mandated by the Big Sky Conference, which CSUN joined in 1995. (It
is difficult to compete in the NCAA without a conference
affiliation).
</P>
<P>
   Northridge must build a stadium or lose its Big Sky membership _
conference officials have given CSUN 18 months to demonstrate it
has sufficient funding. And the Big Sky requires member schools to
have a football team.
</P>
<P>
   However, neighboring homeowner groups are opposed to a new
stadium and have promised a vigorous fight.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge also desperately needs a modern basketball arena. Its
baseball facility was named the country's worst in Division I by
Collegiate Baseball Magazine, and plans to build a state-of-the-art
softball complex died earlier this year when private funding failed
to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to imagine any scenario in which all of those
needs can be met.
</P>
<P>
   And while Northridge couldn't belong to the Big Sky without
football, there has been recent talk of reconfiguring the Big West
Conference into an all-California, no-football conference. Travel
costs would fall dramatically for CSUN, and it would be competing
against schools more like itself.
</P>
<P>
   At Northridge now, football takes up almost 50percent of the
men's sports budget, and Athletic Director Dick Dull acknowledges
very few football programs pay for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge continues to talk of improving its fund-raising
abilities, yet has little to show for it. It doesn't even have a
fund-raising officer at the moment. Michael Rehm, the athletic
department's most recent officer, was forced to leave the
university by former athletic director Sam Jankovich after
Jankovich determined Rehm didn't have the ability to pull in the
type of cash CSUN needs, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, is there someone else who does have the right
touch, who is willing to work for the relatively modest salary
Northridge pays?
</P>
<P>
   The CSU system and the California chapter of the National
Organization of Women reached an agreement following Cal-NOW's 1993
lawsuit that mandates funding, participation and scholarship levels
that nearly mirror each campus' undergraduate student body in terms
of gender.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: in terms of gender.
</P>
<P>
   At CSUN, 59 percent of the students are women, meaning that,
under the agreement, 54 percent of athletics resources must be
earmarked for women.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge has improved markedly, offering the NCAA-maximum
scholarships in many of its women's sports. It has also added
women's soccer and women's golf in recent years. Northridge is
spending $827,410 on women's scholarships and, excluding football,
only 45percent of that ($354,382) on men's scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Most of CSUN's men's sports are operating on a shoestring. The
men's soccer team, for example, operates on $84,000. The women's
soccer team has $198,000. Likewise, the men's volleyball team has
$126,000 to the women's $282,000.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many of the men's teams have little chance to be
competitive at a national level.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its efforts, though, CSUN remains out of compliance with
the Cal-NOW agreement. The problem is, there is no female
equivalent to football and its 50 to 60 scholarships and large
staff of specialized coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating football would immediately solve the gender-equity
dilemma while allowing Northridge to pump up its remaining men's
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a model for schools without football,'' Fullerton's
Franks said. ``(Dropping football) certainly made it easier. We
have been at the forefront of compliance.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Seban of the LAPD's Foothill Division said the peace treaty is
no longer as formidable a force as it once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we have a lot of gang-related homicides and shootings
here in Foothill, and I don't see any evidence of the peace
treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to assigning more officers to problem areas, both
Foothill and Devonshire divisions are aggressively working with
their CLEAR (Community Law Enforcement and Recovery) programs that
partner police officers with probation agents, residents and
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The Foothill and Devonshire divisions are where most
gang-related crimes have taken place. They are up 31 percent and 64
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's three other divisions saw decreases in gang-related
crime, including North Hollywood, which had a 32 percent drop
compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
   Devonshire Division officials blame most of their 166 gang
crimes, 65 more than last year, on having recently taken control of
a 1.3-mile area that the Van Nuys Division was responsible for last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gang-related crime in this area of Panorama City, nicknamed the
Witch's Hat for its triangular shape, was not included in
Devonshire's statistics last year, officials said. And it is one of
the Valley's leading crime hotspots for gang and drug activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heavily populated area with gang and drug activity.
There's more gangs in a smaller area,'' said Devonshire Capt. John
Egan.
</P>
<P>
   Even still, murders in Devonshire were down dramatically, from
10 last year to one this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast Valley Foothill Division, there were 169
gang-related crimes this year, up from 129 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Murders in Foothill were up from 10 to 15 during the first six
months of this year. Rapes in Devonshire were up from 33 to 41.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increase in gang-related offenses, overall serious
crime in Foothill was down 21 percent.

GANG VIOLENCE INCREASING

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Gang-related homicides, rapes and other crimes
have risen in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, despite a plunge in
serious crimes Valleywide in the first six months of 1999, new LAPD
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   Crime attributed to gangs was up 3.65 percent in the Valley
between Jan. 1 and June 30, compared to the same period in 1998.
Even with gang-related offenses, serious crime was down 10 percent
overall in the Valley, police said.
</P>
<P>
   New rivalries for gang turf in the Foothill Division of the
Valley, an area that accounts for a large portion of such crimes,
are partly to blame, said LAPD Capt. Ron Seban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently we have seen gangsters who in the past have not
fought with one another but are now fighting with one another, and
we are trying to figure out why,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What police and gang members say they know for sure is that the
gang truce brokered several years ago has fallen apart because of
new rivalries as membership changes.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the prison-based Mexican Mafia, known as La
Eme, is responsible for fostering violence among gangs by setting
one against the other to collect ``drug-dealing taxes'' in the
Northeast Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A gang member, who declined to give his name for fear of
retaliation, predicted that recent arrests will only spur the
Mexican Mafia to operate more aggressively with street gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't stop anybody. It's going to get worse. They're
getting mad because they're busted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the Mexican Mafia has for some time encouraged
rival gang members to assault or kill Pacoima Project Boyz members,
according to indictments returned June 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sept. 20, 1998, defendant Frank Fernandez instructed
defendant Robert Cervantes to attack members of the Pacoima Project
Boyz gang until `they cry for mercy,' '' said one indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, Mexican Mafia members told members of the
Langdon Street gang to ``hit'' members of the Pacoima Project Boyz
``as often as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, La Eme members agreed to gather with San
Fernando Valley gangs and supply some of them with guns to enlist
their help in attacking the Pacoima Project Boyz, according to the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   And in January, a La Eme member said he needed guns because they
were ``going to start a war with the Pacoima Project Boyz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On Jan. 19, defendants Frank Fernandez and Dominick Gonzales
told gang representatives that they were organizing the San
Fernando Valley gangs for the Mexican Mafia,'' according to the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The two indictments returned June 24 led to the arrests of 40
people, at least seven of whom lived in the Valley, for murder,
drug trafficking and racketeering acts.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state law enforcement officers characterized the
arrests as a ``major crackdown'' on the notorious prison-based gang
that is also known as ``La Eme,'' which they say is seeking to
expand control over drug distributions throughout Southern
California by organizing local street gangs.
</P>
<P>
   But Valley gang members say the arrests from the indictment
won't make much difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's business as usual,'' said a member of the Pacoima Project
Boyz, who declined to give his name. ``Some people go in and some
go out (of jail). It's a whole routine. Other people might just
take over in a couple weeks, a month _ sooner or later. The
pressure's still there. It'll always be there.''
</P>
<P>
   William ``Blinky'' Rodriguez, who brokered the Valley Unity
Peace Treaty among more than 1,000 Northeast Valley gang members,
said that as a new generation of gang members have hit the streets,
the treaty has slowly unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't honestly say that the peace treaty is still in effect
at a certain level, but I can say there are people out there who
are still committed to the peace effort,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Some gangsters who signed on to the treaty, created in October
1993, have left gang life behind. Others abide by the treaty's
premise to refrain from attacking rival gangs, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Younger gang members were barely entering elementary school when
the treaty was made, and Rodriguez has been faced with the
challenge of connecting with this generation. Rodriguez's nonprofit
Communities In Schools, which offers intervention and prevention
programs for at-risk youth, sends counselors to probation camps,
continuation high schools and the streets to get the treaty's
message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime there was a rash of violence, people said (the peace
treaty is) over,'' said Rodriguez. ``But it's not over 'til we say
it's over. We continue to bring gangs together to talk things
out.''
</P>

   Why Sammy Won't Hide &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suppose your testimony had landed a certain John J. Gotti in
prison. You'd surely want to do just one thing _ crawl into the
most remote cave you could find, and sit there quietly, fingers
firmly crossed. At relaxed moments, you might permit yourself to
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   But for Salvatore Gravano _ ``Sammy the Bull'' to friends, if
there are any left _ sitting in the dark just doesn't cut it after
those carefree days filled with extortion, robbery and murder.
</P>
<P>
   After spending some time behind bars after his 1991 testimony
against Gotti and other Mafia biggies, he dutifully followed the
witness-protection drill: plastic surgery, new identity, glue your
mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   But after nine months he'd had it and left the program. He could
``live 20 years in a cabin and be scared to death,'' he said. ``Or
I can live here, where I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is Phoenix, where Gravano keeps poking his head farther
and farther out of his cave of invisibility _ popping up on
television to promote his 1997 biography, ``Underboss,'' returning
to the construction business, even talking to a local paper as long
as it didn't give his new name.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just old gangland buddies who want a piece of him.
Victims' families have filed a $25 million suit against him. But
Gravano, after his dark past, apparently feels he deserves _ and
can get away with _ an all-American sunbelt future.

<P>
   David Cone won 20 games for the New York Yankees last year, but
after the season _ when other pitchers were signing deals for as
much as $105 million _ he received a polite one-year, $8 million
offer from the Yankees, who were concerned about his shoulder. At
36, Cone had thrown as many as 100,000 pitches in his major-league
career and he was only three years removed from an aneursym that
affects the feeling in his fingertips on cold days. Despite much
more lucrative overtures from the Los Angeles Dodgers and Baltimore
Orioles, Cone accepted the Yankees' deal to remain in the city he
loves.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by acupuncture and deep massage in spring training, Cone
felt his shoulder strengthen. Last Sunday, less than a week after
he pitched in the All-Star Game, Cone was electric against the
Montreal Expos. His slider, diving away from right-handed batters,
was so extraordinary that even in the early innings, a no-hitter
seemed almost inevitable; Orlando Cabrera, the ninth-place hitter
for the Expos, said that in the sixth inning, he already was
thinking about being the last out in a perfect game. Throwing just
88 pitches, Cone completed the 16th perfect game in history _ 27
batters, no hits, no walks, no errors.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were stranger-than-fiction coincidences: Don Larsen
threw the first perfect game for the Yankees in the 1956 World
Series and attended the same high school as David Wells, who threw
the second Yankee perfect game last year _ and by chance or fate,
Larsen was in Yankee Stadium to throw out the first ball before
Cone's gem, and was in the clubhouse afterward to greet him with a
bear hug. &QL;

   Tax Cut Passes but a Veto Lies Dead Ahead  &QL;

   Evoking memories of Ronald Reagan's big tax cut in 1981,
Republicans in the House passed a $792-billion tax reduction plan.
It stands little chance of becoming law but sets out the
conservative view of how the nation should allocate projected
budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Its centerpiece is a 10-percent reduction in personal income tax
rates. It also includes a cut in capital gains taxes and a repeal
of inheritance taxes. President Clinton promised a veto but says he

making it capable of reaching Alaska or Hawaii, say diplomatic and

   A Good Deficit  &QL;

<P>
   The more American consumers spend, the more the trade deficit
rises _ last month to a record $21 billion, according to figures
just released. And eventually that's bad news. But for now, it's
good.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit is soaring because the economy is running flat out.
Countries are shipping Americans as much as they will buy. And
because the goods are relatively low cost, they help keep down
inflation, while taking few jobs away from Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But sooner or later the economy will slow. And then today's
inflation-fighting trade deficit will turn into tomorrow's threat
to American jobs. Someday.

   Crackdown on Chinese Sect

   Its members are mostly female and middle-aged. Its practices

</P>
<P>
   To China's Communist rulers, however, the spiritual movement
known as Falun Gong constitutes a ``massive threat'' to the
stability of Chinese society. Declaring the group illegal, Beijing
carried out a vast nationwide crackdown on the group.
</P>
<P>
   The government turned the group's founder, Li Hongzhi, into
public enemy No. 1, branding him in the state-run news media as a
charlatan seeking to create a ``political force in rivalry with our
party and government.'' Li, who has lived in New York since 1998,
defended himself on the Internet _ a medium he often uses to

   The deficit is soaring because the economy is running flat out.
Countries are shipping Americans as much as they will buy. And
because the goods are relatively low cost, they help keep down
inflation, while taking few jobs away from Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But sooner or later the economy will slow. And then today's
inflation-fighting trade deficit will turn into tomorrow's threat
to American jobs. Someday.

   Crackdown on Chinese Sect
</P>
<P>
   Its members are mostly female and middle-aged. Its practices
consist of an amalgam of Buddhism, Taoism and deep breathing
exercises. And its adherents say they seek only to improve their
mental and physical health.
</P>
<P>
   To China's Communist rulers, however, the spiritual movement
known as Falun Gong constitutes a ``massive threat'' to the
stability of Chinese society. Declaring the group illegal, Beijing
carried out a vast nationwide crackdown on the group.
</P>
<P>
   The government turned the group's founder, Li Hongzhi, into
public enemy No. 1, branding him in the state-run news media as a
charlatan seeking to create a ``political force in rivalry with our
party and government.'' Li, who has lived in New York since 1998,
defended himself on the Internet _ a medium he often uses to
communicate with his followers.

   Three former executives of Bankers Trust Corp. were indicted on
federal charges that they diverted $15.1 million of unclaimed
customer funds into the bank's own accounts from 1993 to 1996 in
order to boost their department's financial results, cover budget
shortfalls and even pay for the office Christmas party. Four months
ago, Bankers Trust itself pleaded guilty to similar charges,
agreeing to pay fines totaling $63.5 million. But the three
executives, including a member of the bank's 12-man operating
committee, plan to contest the charges.

<P>
   To those who monitor events in Iran, the arrest of 13 Iranian
Jews on spying charges this year is a menacing sign that bigger
trouble may lie ahead _ trouble that, unchecked, could cause one of
the last two Jewish communities of any size in the Islamic Middle
East to follow most of the others into virtual oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Until the arrests, Jews in Iran had survived the 20-year
dominion of Iran's ruling ayatollahs better than many feared in
1979, when the Islamic republic was declared. In fact, the 30,000
Jews in Iran, while down from the 80,000 who lived there before the
revolution, constitute the largest Jewish community to have
survived in the Muslim Middle East and North Africa. The only other
one of similar size is in Turkey, another non-Arab country, where
about 20,000 Jews remain.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian Jews' significance becomes clearer when their
endurance is measured against what happened elsewhere after the
birth of Israel. From Morocco through Algeria, Tunisia, Libya,
Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Turkey, Jewish communities
that totaled perhaps 1 million people in 1948 dwindled between the
1950s and 1980s to the point that barely 60,000 _ including the
50,000 in Iran and Turkey _ remain.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Iran's Jews must worry that tactics used against Jewish
minorities elsewhere could erode their security, making migration
more attractive. For the time being, the U.S. and European
diplomats who have been leading a discreet campaign to persuade
Iran to drop the spying charges remain hopeful. They point to the
opprobrium that would be sure to fall on Iran if the cases come to
trial, or _ improbable, but still possible, in the view of experts
on Iran _ if the Jews were convicted and sentenced to long prison
terms or death.
</P>
<P>
   The case has unfolded slowly. When the first of the 13 was
arrested in January, the State Department kept the matter quiet,
hoping diplomacy could resolve the issue. But that had not happened
by early June, when Iran announced the arrests over the state
radio.
</P>
<P>
   The spying charges bear every earmark of a trumped-up case.
Those arrested _ including a rabbi, three Hebrew teachers, a kosher
butcher and even, by some reports, a 16-year-old boy _ were
originally picked up for alleged infringements of Iranian laws that
conflict with Jewish practices. The rabbi was charged with teaching
Hebrew, the language of Jewish prayer; others were accused of
closing their shops on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Their actions were condemned as evidence of disloyalty to Iran,
and thus as proof that those arrested were in the service of
``world arrogance'' and ``the Zionist entity,'' meaning the United
States and Israel. By escalating infractions of religious laws into
treason, the conservatives who control Iran's police and courts
evidently hoped to stir antagonism toward the West and place fresh
obstacles before Iran's reformist president, Mohammed Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   By no coincidence, the charges originated in the southern city
of Fars, a stronghold of Islamic conservatives loyal to Ayatollah
Ali Khamanei, Iran's supreme leader. Although the violent clashes
earlier this month between students supporting Khatami and security
forces loyal to the Muslim clerics have now abated, the underlying
dispute between those favoring a broadening of freedoms and the
clerics' insistence on tight control remains. With it, at least
theoretically, remains the risk that other Jews might become
political pawns.
</P>
<P>
   It is a situation redolent of the hazards Jews have faced
throughout history, made more poignant in Iran by the fact that
Jews there seemed, until the spying case, to have a more secure
place than elsewhere in the Muslim Middle East. The Islamic
constitution recognizes Jews as a religious minority, allows them a
representative in Parliament and accepts Jewish laws on burial and
divorce. In Tehran, 27 synagogues function, Jewish schools flourish
and the Jewish hospital is among the city's most respected.
</P>
<P>
   Now all this could be at risk, and with it a crucial vestige of
the Jewish settlement that has left a deep imprint on virtually
every country in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   According to estimates in the ``Atlas of the Jewish World,'' a
survey by Dr. Nicholas de Lange of Cambridge University, as many as
4 million Jews lived in parts of the Roman Empire beyond Judea, the
Jewish homeland, at the dawn of the first millennium; most of these
lived in the Arab lands that now surround Israel. On the eve of the
third millennium, these countries together could not muster a
Jewish population as numerous as those that were once to be found
in many of the major cities of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, where there were about 150,000 Jews in 1948, has about 70
now. In Syria, there are about 300, in Lebanon about 80, in Jordan,
Egypt and Yemen fewer still. In Saudi Arabia there are no Jews, at
least by official count. In Morocco, which had about 300,000 Jews
in 1948, about 6,000 remain. In Algeria, which saw 115,000 Jews
emigrate hastily to France at independence in 1962, the count is
down to a few hundred. In Tunisia, which counted 105,000 Jews in
1950, there are no more than 2,500. In Libya, where a 1931 census
counted 24,500 Jews, one recent count put the number of Jews
remaining at 5. In Turkey, a community of 90,000 in 1948 has shrunk
to less than a quarter of that now.
</P>
<P>
   While flight from the Muslim lands has been precipitous in the
last 50 years, a slower decline dates from the Middle Ages, when
the rise of Christian Europe attracted large westward migrations
among Jewish populations in the Middle East. Other factors,
including local pogroms, prompted Jews to leave over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But in the modern era, the watershed was the creation of Israel.
Living in a Jewish state was an attraction in itself; a surge of
hostility among Arabs toward Jews, or at least toward Zionism, was
another factor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of those who left did so reluctantly, and many chose
not to leave until much later. This attests to something widely
accepted among Jews who have lived as minorities in Muslim nations
_ that the Islamic world has been less fertile ground for
anti-Semitism than the Christian lands of Europe. Why this has been
so has been endlessly debated, but Islamic scholars cite stories
from the life of the Muslim prophet, Mohammed, to show that respect
for Jews was close to his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in Jewish experience in the Middle East came remotely
close to the Holocaust. But even long before Hitler's killing
machine, Jews in Muslim countries were comparing their experiences
favorably with those of Jews in Europe. In his survey, de Lange
quotes a Jew writing from Constantinople to Jews in the Rhineland
in 1454. ``Is it not better for you to live under Muslims than
under Christians?'' he wrote. ``Here, every man may live at peace
under his own vine and fig tree.''

   Since 1948, of course, there has been no lack of discrimination
toward Jews in Arab countries. Eighteen months after the 1967
Arab-Israeli war, Iraq convicted 14 people, nine of them Jews, on
dubious spying charges and hanged them from lampposts in a Baghdad
square. In many Arab countries, Jews could not emigrate, or could
only on forfeit of all they owned. Jewish religious practices were
restricted. In many countries, Jews were excluded from government
employment, at least at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jewish historians have argued that Israel, or at least
Zionists, must accept a share of the blame. These scholars cite the
Zionists' plan to encourage Jews everywhere to migrate to Israel,
and link that plan to covert Israeli intelligence operations in the
years after 1948. One often-cited case involves a bungled Israeli
intelligence schemet in 1954 in which bombs were placed at key
centers in Cairo, including the American library, with a view to
disrupting relations between Western countries and Egyptian
President Gamal Abdel Nasser. These historians say another aim _
and certainly one effect _ was to encourage Egypt's 50,000 Jews to
flee to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Avi Shlaim, a professor of international relations at Oxford
University who has written on relations between Israel and the Arab
states, says that actions like these accelerated the flight of Jews
from communities where many might otherwise have remained. But
Shlaim, whose own family left Iraq for Israel in 1950, believes
that now that the Jewish communities in the region have all but
vanished, not even a lasting peace between Israel and the Arab
states will lead to their regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he says, is not that the Arab states or Iran are
innately anti-Semitic, but that they lack democratic institutions
and economic opportunities. ``I can't imagine anyone in their right
mind going back to Iraq, or Syria, for that matter,'' he says. King
Hassan of Morocco, who died last week, ``held out this opportunity
to Moroccan Jews all along, and even they haven't exercised it,''
Shalim added. ``The most I can imagine now is that Jews born in
these countries may eventually want to return as tourists, but
nothing more.''

AFTER MONTHS OF DELAY, SCHROEDER EMBRACES PAINFUL ECONOMIC
MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ After nine months of confused inertia in economic
policy, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has at last set out where his
New Middle in politics lies _ and it is a long way to the right of
anything previously embraced by the German leader's Social
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning the hesitations that have left Europe's economic
engine stalled with unemployment above 10 percent, Schroeder's
government last week set out a radical agenda of American-inspired
changes aimed at making Germany more nimble, less regulated, more
entrepreneurial and less dependent on the state.
</P>
<P>
   A glossy Economics Ministry report on the sweeping program of
cutbacks in state spending and plans for tax changes and
deregulation quoted the chairman of the Bertelsmann media company,
Dr. Mark Woessner, as saying, ``A piece of America _ without losing
the social aspect of our market economy _ that is the road to
greater German prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Embracing such a message amounts to a big political gamble by
Schroeder, whose political style has previously been one of
sit-on-the-fence prudence in economic matters and whose party still
finds the bedrock of its support among workers, labor unions,
teachers and other state employees who have little enthusiasm for
the wonders of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with Kosovo in military questions, the Social Democrats are
now trying to go way beyond what Chancellor Kohl and the Christian
Democrats ever dared in economic matters,'' said Karsen Voigt, a
Social Democrat. ``But there are considerable dangers, because many
feel the party's traditions have been betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Those dangers include possible defeat in elections in five of
the 16 states in the next few months, including a vote in the
capital, Berlin. It remains far from clear that the Social
Democrats, with no Thatcherite legacy to build on, can follow Tony
Blair's Labor Party in veering steeply rightward without heavy
cost.
</P>
<P>
   But with Europe's long-term prospects and its new currency, the
euro, dependent on Germany's economic performance and high
unemployment sapping the country's self-esteem, Schroeder evidently
felt that further hesitation was unacceptable. Although his
reputation was salvaged as the ``war chancellor'' in the Kosovo
conflict, the Social Democratic leader has seen his popularity sag
since the fighting ended.
</P>
<P>
   His proposed medicine looks dire _ slashing state spending by
$16 billion next year, freezing pensions for two years, ending many
subsidies and cutting the state's share of national income, from
48.8 percent today to 40 percent over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Schroeder has made clear that he wants to balance
the budget, lower taxes and abandon the collective sector-by-sector
wage bargaining that has been a feature of the social-market
economy in favor of wage negotiations based on productivity gains
in individual companies.
</P>
<P>
   The government produced a welter of grim statistics to back the
need for change. The share of long-term unemployed, those out of
work for more than a year, has risen, from 9.6 percent in 1975 to
more than 36 percent today. The state's share of the economy has
jumped, from 39 percent in 1970 to almost 49 today.
</P>
<P>
   Although unemployment in the United States was far higher than
in Germany in 1983, it now stands at less than half the German
level. And the share of wages represented by payments for various
social insurance programs has soared, from 26.5 percent in 1970 to
42.3 percent today.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On that basis, Economic Minister Werner Mueller roundly
dismissed Germany's hugely successful postwar economic model as one
``now stumbling along at the cost of future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Woessner said the chief problem lay in a ``leveling of wages''
and an ``oversupply of Social Security'' that had resulted in a
lack of ``performance-related incentive for those willing to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann has acquired Random House over the last year, and
other big German companies like banks and automakers have also been
investing heavily overseas, partly to offset their dependence on a
sluggish German economy, which has the highest labor costs in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that it is the global outlook of such corporations
that Schroeder, who was on the board of Volkswagen before he became
chancellor last year, is trying to bring to the German economy as a
whole. His sympathies have long stood further to the right than
much of his party's, but he had previously hesitated to discuss
them.
</P>
<P>
   In finally doing so, he risks reinforcing a widespread sense in
Germany that tax and other economic policy has tended to favor the
wealthy while penalizing workers on the pretext that they have to
adjust to the realities of global competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Middle is full of slogans like responsibility,
self-reliance and new entrepreneurship, but the reality is that
most Germans are employees and workers, and once again they are
being asked to make sacrifices,'' said Susanne Stumpenhusen, a
Social Democrat who is head of the union of public-sector workers
in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example,'' Ms. Stumpenhusen said, ``we are now told that
labor unions must exercise wage restraint, because tax cuts will
more than compensate for any salary losses. But we have yet to see
any of those tax benefits. Only when the tax money is in our
pockets can we discuss this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many union members, she expressed sympathy for the
alternative proposals put forward by Oskar Lafontaine, who was
ousted this year as finance minister. Those centered on raising
wages to stimulate demand and jump-start the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic program is one-sided, a pure expression of
neo-liberal economics,'' Michael Knoche of the IG Bau construction
union said. ``Instead of adopting the view of big companies, Mr.
Schroeder should have focused on some of Mr. Lafontaine's ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that Lafontaine is gone, and Schroeder knows
that he almost certainly cannot win the elections in 2002 with
unemployment at its current level and Europe's biggest economy
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of his political gamble appears to be that
short-term setbacks are acceptable if a real reform can be pushed
through that would restore Germany's confidence in its ability to
find employment for its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schroeder has thrown down a gauntlet, declaring that
yesterday's ideology has no place, even if most of his party does
not support him,'' said Lutz Erbring, a political scientist. ``In
essence, he is gambling that a majority of Germans have the common
sense to see that he is right.''

<P>
   The London debut of ``Swetnam the Woman-Hater'' may not have
been the biggest event of 1618, but it had lasting impact.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this play introduced
the word misogynist into the English language. The word caught on
immediately, which makes sense, since there have always been men
who have despised women.
</P>
<P>
   But there have always been women who have despised men. Why,
then, wasn't it until 1946 that an equivalent word for hostility
toward males appeared? And why, once the word misandry surfaced (in
``Scrutiny,'' a defunct British journal of literary criticism), did
it sink quickly into near oblivion?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a word one almost never finds in literature,'' says
Harold Bloom, the Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale
University and author most recently of ``Shakespeare: The Invention
of the Human'' (Riverhead Books). ``It's not even much of a
critical term.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet once Bloom began thinking about it, he had no trouble coming
up with examples of implicit, even explicit, misandry (not to be
confused with misanthropy, which means ``hatred of  &UR; mankind &LR; '').
``I cannot think of one instance of misogyny,'' Bloom said,
referring to the works of Shakespeare, ``whereas I would argue that
misandry is a strong element. Shakespeare makes perfectly clear
that women in general have to marry down and that men are
narcissistic and not to be trusted and so forth. On the whole, he
gives us a darker vision of human males than human females.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in literature as in real life, neither misogyny nor
misandry has the upper hand for long. This makes all the more
perplexing the fact that there's so clearly a winner in the battle
of the language of sexism. Misogyny has made it into just about
every dictionary of the English language. Misandry has not.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the word is currently being seen, if not heard,
more than ever, reflecting an escalation in the behavior it
describes. Misandrous humor is now politically correct. Consider
these recent book titles: ``Women Are From Venus, Men Are From
Hell,'' ``All Men Are Jerks Until Proven Otherwise,'' ``Dads Say
the Dumbest Things: A Collection of Fatherly Wit and Wisdom'' and
``Men and Other Reptiles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When peoples' attitudes change,'' says Frank Abate, editor in
chief of the U.S. Dictionaries Program for Oxford University Press,
``that changes the language.''
</P>
<P>
   But even societal acceptance of misandrous, as opposed to
misogynous, attitudes has not helped misandry catch up with
misogyny in everyday parlance or in print. Misogyny needs no
introduction; misandry appears accompanied by a parenthetical
translation. The following sentence is from the National
Organization for Men's Web site: ``The deleterious effect on men
has been even further exacerbated by the emergence during these
past decades of a misandry (male hatred) that characterizes men in
general as violent, abusive and as historical oppressors.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that political correctness is not a critical
determinant of which words get into dictionaries. ``You can't make
the language do what you want it to do,'' Abate said in an
interview. ``It does what it will do. Modern lexicography regards
itself as recording and reporting much more than prescribing.''
</P>
<P>
   Misandry has lacked the necessary word of mouth. Perhaps it's
simply too much of a mouthful. But, as Harold Bloom points out, the
same could be said of misogyny, ``an absolutely ghastly word,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Misogyny, however, has a buzz that has somehow eluded misandry.
``A word is used in a literary context,'' Abate said, ``or on TV,
in a song, an advertising piece, it could be anything _ it gets
picked up, people hear it and read it and say it _ and then it
sticks. Or it doesn't stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1618, buzz could make a word happen. ``Swetnam the
Woman-Hater,'' whose author remains unknown to this day, is a case
in point. Its main character, Misogenos, was based on one Joseph
Swetnam who had published a pamphlet trashing the female sex, which
caused considerable debate. Dissenting pamphlets included one
titled ``Ester Hath Hang'd Haman'' by Ester Sowernam, who wanted
``to proue, that . . . if there be any offense in woman, men were
the beginners.'' So what launched misogyny was not merely the word;
it was the play, and, beyond the play itself, the fact that it got
people talking.
</P>
<P>
   But some recent wisdom from the Internet, where many people do
their talking nowadays, suggests that it may not take a play called
``The Misandrist'' or a movie called ``Misandry'' (a Stephen King
project?) to put the M-word over the top. Consider the words of
Lynette, age 8: ``Even boys have something to say if you listen
long enough.'' Or Anita, age 9: ``It's better for girls to be
single but not for boys. Boys need someone to clean up after
them.'' Perhaps it's only a matter of time.

   BBO-HALL-FAME (Undated) _ Three weeks apart in September 1992,
George Brett and Robin Yount became the 17th and 18th baseball
players to reach 3,000 hits, and on Sunday they take another joint
step _ going into the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Pitching
great Nolan Ryan and slugger Orlando Cepeda will be inducted with
them. By Murray Chass.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-LIPSYTE-COLUMN (Undated) _ If you've ever spent any private
time with major league umpires, you might mistakenly think that
their egos are even bigger than their bellies. The self-importance
of umpires is astonishing; they pretend to see themselves as
somewhere between the thin red line that protected the British
Empire from its own barbarism and the U.S. Supreme Court. When more
than five umpires appear together, you expect them to start
singing, ``We Are the Game.'' By Robert Lipsyte.

<P>
   TOURDEFRANCE-ARMSTRONG (Futuroscope, France) _ Relaxed and
excited at the same time, Lance Armstrong lounged in a team trailer
shortly before he was to ride his bicycle into Paris and talked
about everything that came to mind _ except for the fact that on
Sunday he will win the Tour de France. Until the moment that he
pulls the final yellow jersey of the winner over his head, he
refuses to refer to more than ``my potential victory.'' By Samuel

always enjoy the overwhelming success it has today. By Tom Durkin.

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At times it semes like the Republicans should just
shut down the campaign and crown George W. Bush as their
presidential nominee. He has the most money. The fanciest
endorsements. The highest poll ratings. The most admiring press.
The scent of a winner.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. There are nine other contenders out there. Don't they
read the newspapers? Watch the polls? Don't they know it's over
before it's begun?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes and no. They read and watch. And they keep telling
themselves they can win.
</P>
<P>
   What do they know that we don't? For one thing, they know that
politics is unpredictable, and they know that the new compressed
calendar of primaries next year makes things doubly unpredictable.
They know that people make mistakes. They know that it is rare for
anyone to win the Republican nomination without having run at least
once before. And they think that the Texas governor has
vulnerabilities, like inexperience, that they can exploit in the
ferocious national political arena.
</P>
<P>
   So the other candidates construct elaborate scenarios of how
they could lasso the prize Texas longhorn. When all else fails,
they pray for a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Meltdown
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponents have a picture in their heads: Bush steps up on
a flatbed truck for the cameras, gets hounded by the press and
snaps. He snarls and says something mean-spirited _ raising
questions about whether he has the temperament to lead the free
world.
</P>
<P>
   Front runners have melted before. Michigan Gov. George Romney's
bid for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination imploded after
he said he had been brainwashed by generals during a visit to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign of Sen. Edmund Muskie, D-Maine,
foundered in 1972 after he stood on a bitter New Hampshire day and
denounced the publisher of the Union Leader of Manchester for
editorials skewering his wife. While the debate was never settled
over whether Muskie was crying or wet-eyed from the snow, the
episode made him appear weak.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has been a cool operator on the campaign trail. Yet
he is known to have a temper. So his rivals hope that unscripted
turbulence on the stump will trigger a tantrum.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush foes think that rather than a single dramatic event, a
series of missteps will cause voters to reconsider. They say a
pattern could leave people thinking that Bush does not have a grasp
of issues, particularly foreign policy. Already, he has called
Kosovars ``Kosovarians'' and Greeks ``Grecians'' and mixed up
Slovakia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Forbes Factor
</P>
<P>
   The scenario that terrifies Bush's advisers the most is that
multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes will blanket the airwaves
with nasty commercials skewering Bush. Forbes can do that because,
unlike the others, he is so rich that he can afford to forfeit
federal matching subsidies, which allows him to spend as much as he
wants in the primaries. (Bush, with a gargantuan campaign war
chest, is also forgoing matching funds.)
</P>
<P>
   Forbes tried this in the 1996 campaign and severely damaged Bob
Dole, but not enough to deprive him of the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big unknown is the Godzilla vs. King Kong factor,'' said
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Elizabeth Dole. ``What happens when
Steve Forbes and George Bush start spending all their money on each
other? Sometimes in the Godzilla vs. King Kong movies, it was the
civilians on the sidewalks who survived.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Fuzz Factor
</P>
<P>
   Republicans of all stripes are so thirsty for a winner that they
have allowed Bush to steer a be-everything-to-everyone course:
Unlike past Republican contenders, he has not panicked over trying
to placate the right wing, but he has not alienated those voters
either.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has addressed many major issues, he has often done so
in a fuzzy way. Eventually, there will be debates, and he will have
to delve into complexities of matters like tax cuts, abortion and
foreign policy. The more details that come out, the more he is
likely to vex somebody. Last week, Bush began to put meat on his
positions by saying the government should provide tax incentives
and federal money for churches and neighborhood groups to help the
needy _ a proposal that critics say would violate the
constitutional separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not know today what the precise issue is that starts to
cut, starts to get people to peel off,'' said Kyle McSlarrow, who
runs the campaign of former Vice President Dan Quayle. ``But the
one that has the highest potential is foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, a spokesman for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said,
``It's not that someone's going to wake up one day and say, `Oh my
God, I think John McCain's tax platform is better than George
Bush's. I've got to switch.' But as time passes, the voters are
going to judge the candidates in the context of a comparison, not a
vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the prospect that Bush might neglect to spot a
major issue or demographic group that is important to the primary
electorate. In 1988, for example, the elder George Bush did not
anticipate the rise of the religious right _ a phenomenon that
threatened to unhinge his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure in your own head to try to keep people from being
mad at you is awfully great,'' said Patrick Caddell, who helped
engineer Jimmy Carter's victory in 1976. ``But he's got Jerry
Falwell with him. And when you're losing only people to the right
of Jerry Falwell, you can breathe easier.''

   WASHINGTON _ At times it semes like the Republicans should just
shut down the campaign and crown George W. Bush as their
presidential nominee. He has the most money. The fanciest
endorsements. The highest poll ratings. The most admiring press.
The scent of a winner.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. There are nine other contenders out there. Don't they
read the newspapers? Watch the polls? Don't they know it's over
before it's begun?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes and no. They read and watch. And they keep telling
themselves they can win.
</P>
<P>
   What do they know that we don't? For one thing, they know that
politics is unpredictable, and they know that the new compressed
calendar of primaries next year makes things doubly unpredictable.
They know that people make mistakes. They know that it is rare for
anyone to win the Republican nomination without having run at least
once before. And they think that the Texas governor has
vulnerabilities, like inexperience, that they can exploit in the
ferocious national political arena.
</P>
<P>
   So the other candidates construct elaborate scenarios of how
they could lasso the prize Texas longhorn. When all else fails,
they pray for a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Meltdown
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponents have a picture in their heads: Bush steps up on
a flatbed truck for the cameras, gets hounded by the press and
snaps. He snarls and says something mean-spirited _ raising
questions about whether he has the temperament to lead the free
world.
</P>
<P>
   Front runners have melted before. Michigan Gov. George Romney's
bid for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination imploded after
he said he had been brainwashed by generals during a visit to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign of Sen. Edmund Muskie, D-Maine,
foundered in 1972 after he stood on a bitter New Hampshire day and
denounced the publisher of the Union Leader of Manchester for
editorials skewering his wife. While the debate was never settled
over whether Muskie was crying or wet-eyed from the snow, the
episode made him appear weak.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has been a cool operator on the campaign trail. Yet
he is known to have a temper. So his rivals hope that unscripted
turbulence on the stump will trigger a tantrum.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush foes think that rather than a single dramatic event, a
series of missteps will cause voters to reconsider. They say a
pattern could leave people thinking that Bush does not have a grasp
of issues, particularly foreign policy. Already, he has called
Kosovars ``Kosovarians'' and Greeks ``Grecians'' and mixed up
Slovakia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Forbes Factor
</P>
<P>
   The scenario that terrifies Bush's advisers the most is that
multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes will blanket the airwaves
with nasty commercials skewering Bush. Forbes can do that because,
unlike the others, he is so rich that he can afford to forfeit
federal matching subsidies, which allows him to spend as much as he
wants in the primaries. (Bush, with a gargantuan campaign war
chest, is also forgoing matching funds.)
</P>
<P>
   Forbes tried this in the 1996 campaign and severely damaged Bob
Dole, but not enough to deprive him of the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big unknown is the Godzilla vs. King Kong factor,'' said
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Elizabeth Dole. ``What happens when
Steve Forbes and George Bush start spending all their money on each
other? Sometimes in the Godzilla vs. King Kong movies, it was the
civilians on the sidewalks who survived.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Fuzz Factor
</P>
<P>
   Republicans of all stripes are so thirsty for a winner that they
have allowed Bush to steer a be-everything-to-everyone course:
Unlike past Republican contenders, he has not panicked over trying
to placate the right wing, but he has not alienated those voters
either.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has addressed many major issues, he has often done so
in a fuzzy way. Eventually, there will be debates, and he will have
to delve into complexities of matters like tax cuts, abortion and
foreign policy. The more details that come out, the more he is
likely to vex somebody. Last week, Bush began to put meat on his
positions by saying the government should provide tax incentives
and federal money for churches and neighborhood groups to help the
needy _ a proposal that critics say would violate the
constitutional separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not know today what the precise issue is that starts to
cut, starts to get people to peel off,'' said Kyle McSlarrow, who
runs the campaign of former Vice President Dan Quayle. ``But the
one that has the highest potential is foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, a spokesman for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said,
``It's not that someone's going to wake up one day and say, `Oh my
God, I think John McCain's tax platform is better than George
Bush's. I've got to switch.' But as time passes, the voters are
going to judge the candidates in the context of a comparison, not a
vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the prospect that Bush might neglect to spot a
major issue or demographic group that is important to the primary
electorate. In 1988, for example, the elder George Bush did not
anticipate the rise of the religious right _ a phenomenon that
threatened to unhinge his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure in your own head to try to keep people from being
mad at you is awfully great,'' said Patrick Caddell, who helped
engineer Jimmy Carter's victory in 1976. ``But he's got Jerry
Falwell with him. And when you're losing only people to the right
of Jerry Falwell, you can breathe easier.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   _ Too Much Money
</P>
<P>
   Bush rocked the political establishment, not to say his rivals,
when he announced that he had amassed a record-shattering $36.3
million in four months. But his opponents hope that Bush's massive
financial advantage can be turned against him. They spread the
notion that Bush is trying to buy the White House _ and is getting
it handed to him on a gold-plated platter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see his strongest card becoming the joker in the deck and
the money becomes a liability rather than an asset,'' said Gary
Bauer, a religious conservative in the race. ``The more days we go
through where stories are written only about the money instead of
where he wants to take America, he runs the risk of a backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Coronation Factor
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he goes, Bush says he has to earn the nomination. But
his foes grouse that he has not had to earn anything. Several
suggested that Bush's appealing self-confidence could cross into
unappealing cockiness. For instance, on the stump in California
recently he referred to himself as ``the president of the United
States'' before correcting himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``American voters like a touch of cockiness in their
presidents,'' said one rival campaign manager. ``They don't like
arrogance in a presumptive nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Calendar Caper
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns agree that if Bush falls apart, it has to happen
in the pivotal early Iowa caucuses or New Hampshire primary. That's
because the primary schedule has become so fast-paced that
candidates who stumble have no time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't always so; in the 1984 Democratic race, Gary Hart
scored an upset in New Hampshire against the front-runner, Walter
Mondale. But Mondale had time to claw his way back to the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, with primaries bunched together earlier, including in
electoral-vote rich California, the race is expected to be decided
by mid-March. Bush's rivals hope his vast operational advantages
may be neutralized by an early loss. ``If this were 1988, Gary Hart
would have been the nominee of the Democratic Party,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Bombshell
</P>
<P>
   In this era of political and personal scandal, rivals say
(usually in off-the-record whispers) that they cannot help but
fantasize that there might be something lurking out there that
would sink Bush. Bush himself has raised their hopes by
acknowledging youthful ``mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all some vague notion that they're going to wake up one
morning and pick up the paper and see a headline and say, `There it
is! The door's wide open!''' said Ed Gillespie, a Republican
strategist. ``But that's not going to happen.''

ISRAELI'S PEACE INITIATIVE PAUSES AFTER DEATH OF MOROCCO'S KING
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Because of the death of King Hassan II of Morocco,
the whirlwind peacemaking itinerary of Ehud Barak, the new prime
minister of Israel, has been slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   A midnight meeting planned for Saturday with Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, has been postponed, as has a visit to
Alexandria, Egypt, to meet with President Hosni Mubarak on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the king's funeral on Sunday will bring
together in Rabat, Morocco, all the key players in the Middle East
peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant, it could produce a first face-to-face
encounter between the Israeli prime minister and President Hafez
Assad of Syria. The two have been sending clear messages back and
forth of their intention to restart Israeli-Syrian negotiations,
but they have not yet exchanged even a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear late Saturday afternoon, though, whether either
leader would attend.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's meetings were expected to be rescheduled for early this
week.
</P>
<P>
   One political analyst here has called Barak ``the Energizer
bunny'' for his relentless full-speed throttle on the efforts
toward peace. After establishing a rapport with Arafat two weeks
ago in their first meeting, Barak was reportedly intent on
hammering out some working understandings with the Palestinian
leader Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts had said they believed the meeting would produce
at least one significant Israeli gesture toward the Palestinians to
allay their concerns that Barak was trying to bluff them with talk
of peace. They had speculated that it could be a release of
political prisoners or the announcement of a date for the next
handover of West Bank land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Zvi Stauber, a foreign policy adviser to the prime minister,
said Barak was planning to try to persuade Arafat not to ``waste
energy'' in haggling over the plans for carrying out the Wye peace
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Barak wants Arafat to agree to rethink the pact, which was an
interim agreement, and to consider combining it with the final
status peace accord. He has said he will not force the issue if
Arafat is opposed, and the Palestinians have expressed a good deal
of opposition and alarm to Barak's idea.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from hours of meeting with Clinton in Washington this
month, Barak made it clear that he personally intended to oversee
the revival of the peace effort. As was the case in Washington, he
is not planning to relegate the first steps to subordinates, but
rather to talk leader-to-leader, man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   Barak seems intent on convincing everyone involved to rise above
himself. On a local level, he wants the Israeli press corps to rise
above its interest in leaking diplomatic tactics _ for the good of
the country. Similarly, he wants Arafat to get beyond his immediate
demands that Wye be carried out _ for the good of the larger peace
effort.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At his news conference last week, President Clinton
was asked why he ridiculed George W. Bush's slogan of
``compassionate conservatism.'' Another questioner wanted to know
what the president found objectionable about the Texas governor's
``trying to present a new moderate face for his party, just like
you did for the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded that Bush had not met the responsibility of
presidential candidates to ``make their positions clear on the
great debates going on now and make their positions clear on what
they would do if they got the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Clinton offered this version of his own race for president
in 1992: ``The first thing I did was tell the American people what
I thought was going on in our country and what I would do. And if
you remember, the late Senator Paul Tsongas and I were actually
almost ridiculed at the time because we both put out these very
detailed plans of what we would do. If you go back and get one of
those plans now, you'll see that virtually everything we said we'd
do we did do, except for the things we tried to do and were
defeated on.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that right or not?
</P>
<P>
   No one can challenge Clinton's point that he offered a detailed
agenda, which he refined over the months. By the fall, he and Al
Gore had published a 240-page book called ``Putting People First''
that offered explicit proposals on issues running the alphabetical
gamut from agriculture to women.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the promises were grand, like cutting the budget deficit
in half, guaranteeing Americans affordable medical insurance,
``ending welfare as we know it'' and providing equal economic
opportunity for all.
</P>
<P>
   Other promises were microscopic in their detail, like saving $2
million in 1993 by adjusting nuclear waste disposal fees for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   And some were simply unmeasurable, like the pledge to give
America ``the best-educated, best-trained workforce in the world,
linked together by transportation and communication networks second
to none.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the quantity, breadth and specificity of Clinton promises
cannot be contested, one can quibble with his view that he
accomplished, or at least tried to accomplish, ``virtually
everything'' he promised to do.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Clinton did reach many of the goals he set in 1992,
was thwarted by political opponents on some, and never even tried
to achieve others.
</P>
<P>
   On the central issue of the 1992 campaign, the economy, his goal
of halving the deficit was left in the dust. The budget was
balanced, and Clinton is now able to foresee enormous surpluses in
government accounts. The unemployment rate fell to the lowest level
in decades and millions of new jobs were created. Inflation was
tamed. The U.S. economy became, as Clinton pledged it would, second
to none.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, over the opposition of Republicans in Congress,
Clinton fulfilled promises to enact a tough gun-control law,
finance 100,000 new community police officers, increase the minimum
wage, start a national service program, give workers time off to
deal with family emergencies and block efforts to restrict
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Working with and in many cases following the Republicans' lead,
he expanded international trade, ended the 60-year-old national
welfare system, reduced the size of the government work force, gave
tax breaks to cities for special empowerment zones and won
authority for a line-item veto, which was ultimately found
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   On some other goals established in 1992, Clinton made an effort
but was stopped by Congress. His most spectacular failure, of
course, was his proposal to provide affordable health insurance
coverage for all Americans through local networks of insurers,
hospitals and doctors. As a campaign theme, it sounded workable.
When Clinton submitted a plan along those lines after he became
president, it proved to be unwieldy and unpopular and died while
Democrats still controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents forced the president to withdraw his promise to let
homosexuals serve in the military. He instead instituted the
compromise policy of ``don't-ask, don't-tell,'' which satisfies no
one.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also stopped the president from keeping his promises to
``rebuild America'' by spending billions on a jobs and public works
program. And it rejected his proposal that companies with striking
workers be prohibited from hiring replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton simply broke other promises. Here are some of the ones
he reneged on:
</P>
<P>
   Even before he took office, he dropped his proposal for a
middle-income tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   He never tried to repeal the limit on how much money people over
65 can earn before their Social Security benefits are reduced.
</P>
<P>
   He gave lip service to campaign finance reform but exerted no
effort to attain it.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly forgot a plan to require businesses to spend 1.5
percent of their payroll on continued education and training of
workers.
</P>
<P>
   He never ended tax breaks for companies that shut down American
plants and ship jobs overseas.
</P>
<P>
   He never made improvement in China's human rights record a
condition for favorable trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting an increase in the gasoline tax, he
sponsored legislation that raised it by 4.3 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the fewer promises from 1992 Clinton kept, the
more popular he became. His grandest achievements were in 1993, his
first year in office, and the public did not seem particularly
grateful. Late in 1994, his second year, Clinton's presidency was
in a shambles, and Republicans won control of both houses of
Congress for the first time in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton began thinking small bore. He won re-election in
1996 without big promises and has concentrated since then on
blocking Republican ambitions. ``There was a misreading of how much
change people wanted,'' explained Clinton's former adviser, Harold
M. Ickes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why Bush is promising so little. And maybe, just
maybe, it's why Clinton is egging him on.

he expanded international trade, ended the 60-year-old national
welfare system, reduced the size of the government work force, gave
tax breaks to cities for special empowerment zones and won
authority for a line-item veto, which was ultimately found
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   On some other goals established in 1992, Clinton made an effort
but was stopped by Congress. His most spectacular failure, of
course, was his proposal to provide affordable health insurance
coverage for all Americans through local networks of insurers,
hospitals and doctors. As a campaign theme, it sounded workable.
When Clinton submitted a plan along those lines after he became
president, it proved to be unwieldy and unpopular and died while
Democrats still controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents forced the president to withdraw his promise to let
homosexuals serve in the military. He instead instituted the
compromise policy of ``don't-ask, don't-tell,'' which satisfies no
one.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also stopped the president from keeping his promises to
``rebuild America'' by spending billions on a jobs and public works
program. And it rejected his proposal that companies with striking
workers be prohibited from hiring replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton simply broke other promises. Here are some of the ones
he reneged on:
</P>
<P>
   Even before he took office, he dropped his proposal for a
middle-income tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   He never tried to repeal the limit on how much money people over
65 can earn before their Social Security benefits are reduced.
</P>
<P>
   He gave lip service to campaign finance reform but exerted no
effort to attain it.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly forgot a plan to require businesses to spend 1.5
percent of their payroll on continued education and training of
workers.
</P>
<P>
   He never ended tax breaks for companies that shut down American
plants and ship jobs overseas.
</P>
<P>
   He never made improvement in China's human rights record a
condition for favorable trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting an increase in the gasoline tax, he
sponsored legislation that raised it by 4.3 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the fewer promises from 1992 Clinton kept, the
more popular he became. His grandest achievements were in 1993, his
first year in office, and the public did not seem particularly
grateful. Late in 1994, his second year, Clinton's presidency was
in a shambles, and Republicans won control of both houses of
Congress for the first time in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton began thinking small bore. He won re-election in
1996 without big promises and has concentrated since then on
blocking Republican ambitions. ``There was a misreading of how much
change people wanted,'' explained Clinton's former adviser, Harold
M. Ickes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why Bush is promising so little. And maybe, just
maybe, it's why Clinton is egging him on.

   A snub-nosed California child who loves to dance in glittery
costumes is kidnapped from her bed during a sleep-over and
murdered. An infant in day care, just turned a year old, is crushed
to death when the Oklahoma City federal building explodes at the
hand of terrorists. A Colorado teen-ager, proclaiming her faith in
God, is shot at close range by a rampaging schoolmate.
</P>
<P>
   Like John F. Kennedy Jr., who few knew but many mourned, Polly
Klaas, Baylee Almon and Cassie Bernall became America's nearest and
dearest, however briefly, through the unique intimacy of
television, which brought them, brimming with life, into our living
rooms and bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, people knew more about them than about their
neighbors and colleagues. But it was impossible to pay a condolence
call, deliver a casserole, offer a hug or cry at the funeral. And
so they built shrines.
</P>
<P>
   For Polly, there were mountains of teddy bears in a parking lot
in Petaluma, Calif. For Baylee, there were letters in childish
script, pushed through the gaps in the chain-link fence that
contained the rubble of the Murrah Building. For Cassie, there was
a handmade wooden cross not far from Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   And now, for Kennedy, there are flickering candles, poems and
prayers, bouquets heaped upon bouquets, outside his New York
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Memorials to the dead date from the beginning of time, an
impulse hard-wired in the human psyche to comfort the soul of the
dead and relieve the sadness of the living. But ``the size and
elaboration of these public displays of grief are a new phenomenon
of the pop culture,'' said Phillips Stevens Jr., a professor of
anthropology at the State University at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Some see these shrines _ the largest by far was for Princess
Diana outside Kensington Palace _ as distasteful exhibitionism,
another version of venting on talk radio or confessing sleazy
secrets on daytime television. Others believe the celebrity culture
has made it possible for people to replace the joy and heartbreak
of real intimacy with phony _ and undemanding _ emotional
connections.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a more sympathetic way to view these makeshift
shrines to strangers, be they celebrities or unknown victims of
great public tragedy. Joshua Meyrowitz, a professor of
communication at the University of New Hampshire, calls them
``media friends'' who enter our lives with such intensity that our
feelings for them are both powerful and genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Meyrowitz described his own interior conversations with such
people. In 1980, after a gunman killed John Lennon outside his New
York apartment building, the scene of one of the earliest of these
shrines, Meyrowitz wished with an intensity usually reserved for
loved ones that Lennon had chosen a different moment to exit his
car. So, too, with Kennedy's fatal flight. ``John, why didn't you
wait until morning?'' Meyrowitz said he asked himself, this time
aloud.
</P>
<P>
   With attachments so deep, there must be rituals for mourning,
and so people invent them. ``We have to find a place to hang these
feelings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Levinson, a professor of media studies at Fordham
University, agreed. ``Funerals exist in all human societies,'' he
said. ``We are a communal species, and throughout history we have
worked out ways to express communal grief. So this is what we do
when we're not invited to the funeral.''

UNREASONABLE SUSPICION: DRAWING THE LINE ON THE STRIP-SEARCH

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The jail-house drill is simple, if humiliating: Take
off your clothes. Raise your hands over your head. Be prepared to
bend over or squat. Someone may run a hand through your hair.
</P>
<P>
   You have just been strip-searched, a procedure that is done
thousands of times a day in jails, prisons and police stations
throughout the country. But its very routineness has been called
into question in the wake of recent lawsuits filed by people who
were searched after being arrested for fare beating and other minor
offenses. Just last week in New York, Alton Fitzgerald White, who
plays a leading role in the Broadway musical ``Ragtime,'' suffered
the indignity of such a search after being mistakenly arrested on
drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in New York ruled in June that people charged
with misdemeanors could not be strip-searched unless there was
reasonable suspicion that they were hiding something. This spring
an estimated 4,000 people in Kentucky were searched illegally, and
the authorities agreed to pay $11.5 million to settle a lawsuit
brought on their behalf. White is discussing a lawsuit against New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   The legal decisions may force correction officials to rethink a
policy that has been effective in keeping drugs and weapons out of
detention centers and reducing violence in jails. Critics say the
officials who authorized searches later found to be illegal either
misunderstood, ignored or were unaware of established legal
boundaries defining who could be strip-searched.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade the courts have struggled to define these
parameters. There has been little objection to searching prison
convicts or suspects charged with violent felonies or drug crimes.
But the courts have said that those charged with petty crimes like
urinating in public cannot be routinely strip-searched.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction was lost on officials at the Nassau County jail
and at several New York City booking facilities, where people are
held until they can be brought before a judge. They set up policies
that resulted in strip-searching everyone in custody. Now thousands
may claim damages as part of the class-actions suits that have been
filed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent rulings, New York City still strip-searches
everyone entering its major jail at Rikers Island, regardless of
the charge. ``It is remarkable, after all these years, that the
jail people just can't figure it out,'' said Richard Emery, an
attorney whose office has filed several suits on behalf of people
who have been searched.
</P>
<P>
   Some searches are clearly legal. Prisons search inmates because
they have already been convicted and because security is a
paramount concern. The courts have also enabled police officers or
jail guards to search people arrested for misdemeanors if there is
a reasonable suspicion that they are hiding a weapon or other
contraband.
</P>
<P>
   But ``reasonable suspicion'' is a phrase open to broad
interpretation, and some law enforcement officials argue for wide
latitude, suggesting that all prostitutes, for example, could be
strip-searched given the prevalence of drug use among them.
</P>
<P>
   None of those distinctions were made at New York City booking
locations in Manhattan and Queens during a 10-month period between
1996 and 1997. Everyone was searched. Emery, who has brought a suit
against New York City on behalf of many of those searched,
estimates that as many as 63,000 people may have been subjected to
the procedure. City officials privately acknowledge the mistake,
saying that when the Corrections Department took over operations
from the Police Department, it transferred the policy used at city
jails; everyone _ even those awaiting arraignment _ stripped.
</P>
<P>
   New York has since revised the policy, but it may become an
expensive error. In one case decided last month, one woman, who was
strip-searched after her arrest in a domestic dispute, was awarded
$19,600 in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.
If the thousands of people represented in the class-action case
were awarded even the lesser sum, the financial toll on the city
would be huge.
</P>
<P>
   City lawyers are confident that a jury will decide that many
people, though their rights may have been violated, endured only a
momentary inconvenience. ``Not very many people felt they
experienced emotional or physical damages,'' said Norma Kerlin, an
assistant corporation counsel for the city, because only about a
dozen of those searched bothered to file lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, many jail officials in the country had assumed
they could search anyone after arraignment and before admitting the
person to jail. But in June, in a Nassau County case, a federal
judge ruled that the county could not search people without cause
if they were jailed for minor offenses. Nassau has since amended
its policy, but is pursuing an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruling, New York City continues to strip-search
everyone at Rikers as part of an enhanced security initiative that
has seen slashings drop dramatically. City officials plan to file a
brief supporting Nassau's appeal. ``The judge's ruling was specific
to the Nassau jail,'' said Thomas Antenen, a corrections spokesman.
``It does not impact our system.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, police officers are required to get a
supervisor's approval for such a search. But critics say
unauthorized searches still happen. In White's case, officials, who
have apologized for the mistaken arrest, said searching the actor
was authorized because he was brought in as a suspect in a felony
drug case.
</P>
<P>
   But Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, who has been advising White, questioned how police
could have developed a reasonable suspicion to search him since
they had no grounds for the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the city recently had to pay $25,000 each to
four Fordham University students who were forced to disrobe in the
restroom of a Bronx station house last year after they were
arrested for doubling up to pass through a subway turnstile. As it
turned out, a police supervisor filled out a document approving the
searches _ after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted to protect them so they would not be
searched again when they got to central booking,'' said the
students' lawyer, Martha Rayner.

   At the White House last week, the U.S. women's soccer team stood
behind President Clinton facing an ocean of cameras that has
recorded the team's every move for the last month.
</P>
<P>
   But peering back at the cameras was a video camera held aloft by
Kristine Lilly, the most valuable player of the World Cup
tournament and one of several team members who served as
chroniclers of the chronicled.
</P>
<P>

   At baseball's All-Star festivities at Fenway Park this month,

   Why would a professional athlete, who has spent a career
striving for the celebratory moments that follow a championship,
choose to stand on the sidelines videotaping teammates as they

participating in it?

   ``It's as if living it doesn't make it real,'' said Neal Gabler,
the cultural historian and author of ``Life the Movie: How
Entertainment Conquered Reality'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1998.) Because

   Cheap technology has helped fuel the trend. But there is
probably a different motivation for those who want to record events
in which they are the center of attention _ particularly for a
sports star wealthy enough to hire a personal documentarian.

   ``I think it's an effort to regain some kind of power, to be the

``The Frenzy of Renown: Fame and Its History'' (Oxford University

<P>
   Stepping behind a camera, Braudy said, ``gives you power over
the audience, rather than the audience having power over you.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Foudy, the women's soccer team co-captain whose camera was
passed around at events, said that she aimed to capture the
``little details'' of the team's public and private moments that
are forgotten over time. And because she filmed from the first
practices to the White House visit, ``we have on tape how it grew
into this frenzied following,'' she said.

<P>
   But even those who are used to being celebrated can feel
overwhelmed, particularly at the pinnacle of achievement, said Neil

   ``When thousands of people who you do not know are showering you
with love,'' Goldberg said, ``it can feel very safe to be behind a

   At the White House last week, the U.S. women's soccer team stood
behind President Clinton facing an ocean of cameras that has
recorded the team's every move for the last month.
</P>
<P>
   But peering back at the cameras was a video camera held aloft by
Kristine Lilly, the most valuable player of the World Cup
tournament and one of several team members who served as
chroniclers of the chronicled.
</P>

   ``If you want a friend in Washington,'' the saying goes, ``get a
dog.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with this advice is that it's not nearly cynical
enough. All that can be said about a dog's state of mind is that
its behavior is hard-wired to encourage that belief.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds paranoid, recent research has exposed, yet again,
the copious pitfalls of deceit in human-animal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are con artists, according to Stephen Budiansky, author of
``If a Lion Could Talk.'' ( Budiansky's dog snookered him into
sharing the author's photograph on the book's dust jacket, and
doubtless into a 50-50 split of the royalties too).
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are particularly adroit at manipulating human emotions;
they have inherited a sharp sensitivity to social cues from their
wolf forebears. They can read human body language and tones of
voice, divining just what is required of them. When you yell at
your dog for soiling the carpet and he cringes, you are probably
mollified by his obvious regret. It may be obvious, but is it
sincere?
</P>
<P>
   ``The cringe is a successful technique for deflecting
aggression,'' Budiansky wrote in the July issue of The Atlantic
Monthly. ``Millions of years of wolf evolution have selected such
behaviors because they are socially effective; thousands of years
of dog evolution have fine-tuned such behaviors so that they are
socially effective on people.''
</P>
<P>
   In kicking the wolf way of life for that of a hanger-on in human
societies, dogs have achieved extraordinary success. Wolves number
no more than 150,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   There are 50 million dogs in this country alone, costing their
owners $5 billion a year in dog food, $7 billion in veterinary care
and $250 million in insurance claims for the 800,000 people bitten
seriously enough to warrant medical attention, Budiansky writes.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs couldn't pull off this monstrous trick without a lot of
help from their victims. The way that people relate to another
species, dolphins, shows how strong is the urge to project their
desires and expectations onto animal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, unlike dogs, are wild mammals with no experience in
interpreting or manipulating the weird behavior of higher primates.
Yet they have acquired a saintly image. They save drowning sailors.
They like playing with swimmers. New Age dolphins have healing
powers. They are wise, gentle and love people.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have recently learned that bottlenose dolphins, far
from being the pacifists of the Pacific, are ferocious killers of a
related species, the harbor porpoise. The protective behavior
imputed to dolphins arises from misconstruing aspects of their
natural behavior. Dolphins don't get a kick from swimming alongside
boats: They're just enjoying a free ride in its wake. They are not
trying to save you from a shark attack: They are just
rubber-necking at your fish-out-of-water antics and sharks know to
stay out of the way of these dangerous animals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert Terrace, a Columbia University psychologist who
studies cognition, says animal aggression is not a popular topic,
even among scientists, in part because it is hard to study.
``People will persist in their preconceived notions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a highly intelligent animal like a dolphin or a
chimpanzee, people cannot resist imputing to it whatever they would
feel in the same context. This is probably part of our genetic
programming. The whole art of living in social groups, after all,
is to figure out other members' intentions and act accordingly.
People do this instinctively, and almost any fellow mammal will
trip the reflex.
</P>
<P>
   Even a horse. The classic case of human self-deception is that
of Clever Hans, a performing horse in Berlin around 1900. By
tapping his hoof a certain number of times, the horse could count,
make correct change, tell time and calculate the day and date in a
given calendar year. He would perform these feats not only for his
trainer, a schoolteacher named Wilhelm von Osten, but for many
others too, provided they knew the answer beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The Clever Hans phenomenon was solved by a clever psychologist,
Oskar Pfungst, who found that the testers, ever eager to be
astounded, were unconsciously cueing the horse. As Hans approached
the right number of hoof taps, expectant questioners would betray
their interest with an involuntary tensing of the body. Dr. Pfungst
ascertained that Hans could detect head movements as small as
one-fifth of a millimeter. The psychologist even played the role of
horse himself, finding that 23 out of 25 questioners cued him as to
the correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   His findings, first published in English in 1911, failed to put
an end to the charade. By 1937 there were more than 70 cats, dogs
and horses with marvelous cognitive powers. Many of the recent
attempts to teach chimpanzees language may have been marred by the
same fallacy.
</P>
<P>
   When Odysseus returned to Ithaca from the Trojan wars after 20
years, he disguised himself as a beggar to survey the palace where
his wife's suitors were partying and to plan their slaughter. No
one perceived the hero beneath his contemptible rags and grime _
none save his dog Argos. The dog thumped his tail, Homer records,
but expired in the effort to greet Odysseus, making even the
hardened warrior shed a tear that nearly betrayed him.
</P>
<P>
   Are animals uncanny judges of human character? Do they know us
better than we know ourselves? Who can tell what they really think?
Their actions are as opaque as a mirror, reflecting the projections
of our innermost desires, not theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Human relationships that go sour are often attributed to
misunderstanding, even when the obvious cause is that the parties
understand each other only too well. Total misunderstanding can
frame the perfect basis for a relationship: In such a setting,
one's partner fulfills every expectation, never rejects,
disappoints or betrays. And how else can you achieve such
gloriously happy misunderstanding, except with a dog?

UNSETTLING TV COMMERCIALS: AND NOW, A GROSS-OUT FROM OUR SPONSOR

<P>
   Gross-out comedy: Its vulgarity, in movies like ``American Pie''
and television shows like ``South Park,'' has younger viewers in
stitches. But its proliferation _ there's more in store this fall
on television _ has parents and others bemoaning anew the
coarsening of American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both younger and older viewers can claim a measure of
dubious credit for a less-noted factor in the coarsening of
culture: gross-out TV commercials. Both are, after all, target
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of ads follow the same rationale that
youth-oriented films and TV shows do: If you shock with crudeness,
lewdness, black humor or violence, people pay attention, especially
those who equate such qualities with being hip.
</P>
<P>
   Other, more conventional TV advertisers are attuned to the way
of all flesh, particularly that of aging, self-indulgent baby
boomers _ and lately that's not so pretty either.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot of the two trends? ``It's often not fun to turn on TV,''
says Bob Garfield, a critic for Advertising Age. A judicious
sampling illustrates the point.
</P>
<P>
   _ TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   COMMERCIAL No. 1: THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG DETROL.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettling factors: Discussion of overactive bladder, and
possible side effects if you treat it.
</P>
<P>
   When seen: March 3 on ``The Price Is Right'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   (The words ``Overactive Bladder'' fill the TV screen.)
</P>
<P>
   Male announcer: Overactive bladder.
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: Those strong sudden urges.
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 2: Going to the bathroom so often.
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 3: Wetting accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: Discover prescription Detrol. Detrol is proven
effective to treat overactive bladder. Detrol reduced bathroom
visits by 2.2 times in 24 hours versus 1.1 times with a sugar pill.
</P>
<P>
   Husband (in park, pushing wife on swing): Stay a little longer?
</P>
<P>
   Wife: Love to. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Announcer's disclaimer: Do not take Detrol if you have certain
types of stomach, urinary or glaucoma problems. The most common
side effect is dry mouth. . . . Common, but less frequent ones, may
include dry eyes, headache, constipation and indigestion. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Husband (strolling with wife at beach): Head back?
</P>
<P>
   Wife: Not right now. . . .
</P>
<P>
   COMMERCIAL No. 2: GAS-X.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettling factor: Husband and wife bloated with intestinal gas
after big meal.
</P>
<P>
   When seen: Last Monday, during ``World News Tonight'' on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Husband (sitting in car with wife): Great meal.
</P>
<P>
   (But then, thanks to special effects, the husband and wife blow
up like balloons.)
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: Uh-oh. Gas pressure. What now? What else? Gas-X. For
the most powerful medicine for fast relief, nothing works faster.
</P>
<P>
   Husband (deflated): Hey, want to go for ice cream?
</P>
<P>
   (Wife, still inflated, doesn't look so sure.)
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: Gas-X, the power to fight gas fast.
</P>
<P>
   COMMERCIAL No. 3: POND'S CLEAR PORE STRIPS.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettling factor: Blackheads being ripped from the faces of
young women.
</P>
<P>
   When seen: Jan. 5, 1998, on the soap opera ``Guiding Light'' on
CBS in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: You know, I've heard of these strips.
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 2: I've been dying to try them.
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 3. They clean up your blackheads.
</P>
<P>
   (The women put adhesive strips across their noses.)
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: . . . OK, you ready?
</P>
<P>
   Women (together): One, two, three!
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 2 (looking at the adhesive strip she pulled from her
nose): There they are!
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 3: Looks like little forests. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: It's like a veritable blackhead magnet!

</P>
<P>
   Man (in suit, seated in a leather armchair in tony
surroundings): In an effort to get people to remember our name,
Outpost.com, we contacted the local high school marching band and
asked them to help us out.
</P>
<P>
   (The marching band forms the letters of the company's name on a
football field, to the tune of ``When the Saints Go Marching In.'')
</P>

pack of ravenous wolves.

   Unsettling factor: Bob Dole discussing erectile dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   When seen: Feb. 14, during the Daytona 500 on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Dole (seated in armchair): Courage, something shared by
countless Americans, those who risked their lives, those who battle
serious illness. When I was diagnosed with prostate cancer, I was
primarily concerned with ridding myself of the cancer, but
secondly, I was concerned about possible post-operative side
effects like erectile dysfunction, ED, often called impotence.
</P>
<P>
   You know, it's a little embarrassing to talk about ED, but it's
so important to millions of men and their partners that I decided
to talk about it publicly. And after all, it can be associated with
many conditions, including prostate surgery, high blood pressure,
diabetes, even smoking. And the point I want to make is that there
are many treatments available for E.D. So my advice is to get a
medical checkup. . . . It may take a little courage, but I've
always found that everything worthwhile does.

   Priest: Relax, my son. You're going to be just fine. What's your
name?
</P>
<P>
   Patient: Bob.
</P>
<P>
   Priest: And what do you do, Bob?
</P>
<P>
   Patient: I work for a big long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   Priest (suddenly angered): You dirty, rotten. . . .

<P>
   (The curtain shrouding the patient's bed is shown as sounds of
the priest beating Bob mercilessly ensue.)
</P>
<P>
   Nurse (arriving on scene): Father, stop!

   Gross-out comedy: Its vulgarity, in movies like ``American Pie''
and television shows like ``South Park,'' has younger viewers in
stitches. But its proliferation _ there's more in store this fall
on television _ has parents and others bemoaning anew the
coarsening of American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both younger and older viewers can claim a measure of
dubious credit for a less-noted factor in the coarsening of
culture: gross-out TV commercials. Both are, after all, target
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of ads follow the same rationale that
youth-oriented films and TV shows do: If you shock with crudeness,
lewdness, black humor or violence, people pay attention, especially
those who equate such qualities with being hip.
</P>
<P>
   Other, more conventional TV advertisers are attuned to the way
of all flesh, particularly that of aging, self-indulgent baby
boomers _ and lately that's not so pretty either.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot of the two trends? ``It's often not fun to turn on TV,''
says Bob Garfield, a critic for Advertising Age. A judicious
sampling illustrates the point.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Now that NATO's bombers have forced
the Serbs to capitulate in Kosovo, the question naturally arises:
Couldn't the world's big powers try the same thing in Africa, which
has been in dire need of peacemaking and peacekeeping for so long?
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Victor Malu of Nigeria hinted at one answer two years ago,
when he led a Nigerian army unit overseeing an election in Liberia.
Having warned the warring militias that his peacekeepers would
``pour fire into anyone trying to disrupt the vote,'' he taunted a
reporter: ``What's the matter with you Americans? You lost your
stomach for peacekeeping in Somalia after you lost, what, 21 men?
I've lost 500 here already.''
</P>
<P>
   An American looking at the Nigerian peacekeepers might well
wonder, as the Cowardly Lion did: ``Whadda they got that I ain't
got?'' Well, stomach for that kind of warfare, for one thing. But
whether to wade into Africa's wars involves a lot more than just
courage.
</P>
<P>
   The question is especially pointed now, because two cease-fire
deals have recently been negotiated in Africa _ in Sierra Leone,
where there is some promise that the truce will hold, and in Congo,
where such prospects seem bleak. In both, outsiders are being
called on by the warring parties to send peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Will they be from the West? Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, for a moment, that the United States and Europe would
actually try to make peace in an African war. What lessons from
Kosovo might apply in Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone or Eritrea?
</P>
<P>
   For instance, can an African war be won with air power? Can
ground troops be inserted without putting them in harm's way? If
so, would they do any good?
</P>
<P>
   Military and political analysts here say the first question is
easy to answer. Air power has never been much use in Africa,
because rural Africans already lack factories, electricity, bridges
and armored divisions. ``Bomb what?'' said Claude Kabemba, a
foreign policy analyst for the Center for Policy Studies, a
research institute in South Africa. ``In Congo, war is a guy under
a tree with an AK-47.''
</P>
<P>
   There has ben some bombing on the Ethiopia-Eritrea border, but
that war is fought the way World War I was: with human waves flung
against trenches. In the Congo, Zimbabwean jets have sunk ferries
said to be carrying rebels, but haven't been decisive in a battle.
</P>
<P>
   One war here might be ended with a precision strike: If a
missile tracked Jonas Savimbi's satellite phone signals into the
Angolan bush, it might behead the Unita rebel movement. But that
would require unpalatable choices: it would be a bald
assassination, it would hand victory to a government whose behavior
is only slightly better than Savimbi's, and some analysts say
Savimbi's generals might fight on without him.
</P>
<P>
   Helmoed-Romer Heitman, an analyst for Jane's Defense Weekly,
discerned two uses for air power in peacekeeping: AWACS planes and
fighters could impede, but probably not stop, the flow of men and
weapons around Congo and northern Angola, where roads are so bad
that decrepit ex-Soviet cargo planes ferry both.
</P>
<P>
   More important, if a force of African soldiers willing to go
into danger areas was mustered, transports for the troops and
helicopters for their commanders would be a very useful Western
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Any mission for ground troops is more problematic.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations troops have poor reputations in Africa. Many are
small units from poor nations like Bangladesh, sent because the
United Nations pays their governments hundreds of dollars a day for
each soldier. A dozen units from a dozen countries whose only
mission is to look around and maybe get shot at are bound to fail,
as such a force did in Angola this year.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's well-trained and equipped troops are a different matter.
They could easily win battles. But that isn't peacekeeping. Congo
is 215 times the size of Kosovo, Angola 114 times. The terrain is
far more difficult, the fighting a patchwork of skirmishes without
front lines. If some 20,000 NATO troops have found it hard to
prevent murders of Serbs and Albanians in remote Balkan villages,
what could they do in Congo? The United Nations Department of
Peacekeeping Operations told one military analyst in Pretoria that
patrolling Congo would require 100,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   And for how long? And what would they do when they were shot at?
The Congo cease-fire document expects the peacekeepers to disarm
more than a dozen armed forces, including Unita, the Mayi-Mayi
guerrillas and the Hutu militias. Unita has been at war for 25
years. The Mayi-Mayi charge into battle naked, thinking they're
bulletproof. The Hutu militias, if disarmed, would be deported to
Rwanda to be executed for genocide, so it is unlikely that they
will disarm voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there's the ``stomach'' issue. Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, whose troops are fighting in Congo, was recently reported
to be mocking Western peacekeepers. ``Which U.N. troops will stay
in these mountains for six months?'' the Monitor newspaper quoted
him as saying. ``They will just run away like they did in Rwanda.
European soldiers go only to areas where there is no death.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the battle zone is contained, as in the Badme Triangle
between Ethiopia and Eritrea, peacekeepers could be a buffer
between the sides, as in Cyprus or the Golan Heights. But such
situations can be open-ended. Heitman put it this way: ``Cyprus?
The U.N.'s been there since the 60's. And if they left, the Turkish
and Greek Cypriots would go right back to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in Washington, London and Paris know this. They
haven't volunteered troops for Africa and thus far are reluctant to
pay for a United Nations effort.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for a couple of years now, the United States and Europe
have been prodding African countries to form a joint force to calm
the continent's constant crises. Even France, whose Foreign Legion
once aggressively policed its ex-colonies, wants out, said Chris
Landsberg, deputy director of the Center for Policy Studies. Africa
is slowly warming to the idea of a regional joint force, but it's
still all theory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the skittishness of the West infuriates Africans, who
often say it is racism to spend $1.50 per Kosovo refugee but only
11 cents per African refugee. Many African nations like Nigeria and
South Africa say they would be willing to provide the men to do
peace-keeping, but need help paying for them _ lots of help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Post-Somalia, post-Rwanda, the West is able but unwilling, and
Africa is willing but unable,'' said Landsberg. ``Somehow, we have
to convince the West that peace in this area is in their interest.
And then hundreds of millions of dollars has to come from somewhere
_ $20 million here and $20 million there isn't going to do it.''

   Imagine, for a moment, that the United States and Europe would
actually try to make peace in an African war. What lessons from
Kosovo might apply in Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone or Eritrea?
</P>
<P>
   For instance, can an African war be won with air power? Can
ground troops be inserted without putting them in harm's way? If
so, would they do any good?
</P>
<P>
   Military and political analysts here say the first question is
easy to answer. Air power has never been much use in Africa,
because rural Africans already lack factories, electricity, bridges
and armored divisions. ``Bomb what?'' said Claude Kabemba, a
foreign policy analyst for the Center for Policy Studies, a
research institute in South Africa. ``In Congo, war is a guy under
a tree with an AK-47.''
</P>
<P>
   There has ben some bombing on the Ethiopia-Eritrea border, but
that war is fought the way World War I was: with human waves flung
against trenches. In the Congo, Zimbabwean jets have sunk ferries
said to be carrying rebels, but haven't been decisive in a battle.
</P>
<P>
   One war here might be ended with a precision strike: If a
missile tracked Jonas Savimbi's satellite phone signals into the
Angolan bush, it might behead the Unita rebel movement. But that
would require unpalatable choices: it would be a bald
assassination, it would hand victory to a government whose behavior
is only slightly better than Savimbi's, and some analysts say
Savimbi's generals might fight on without him.
</P>
<P>
   Helmoed-Romer Heitman, an analyst for Jane's Defense Weekly,
discerned two uses for air power in peacekeeping: AWACS planes and
fighters could impede, but probably not stop, the flow of men and
weapons around Congo and northern Angola, where roads are so bad
that decrepit ex-Soviet cargo planes ferry both.
</P>
<P>
   More important, if a force of African soldiers willing to go
into danger areas was mustered, transports for the troops and
helicopters for their commanders would be a very useful Western
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Any mission for ground troops is more problematic.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations troops have poor reputations in Africa. Many are
small units from poor nations like Bangladesh, sent because the
United Nations pays their governments hundreds of dollars a day for
each soldier. A dozen units from a dozen countries whose only
mission is to look around and maybe get shot at are bound to fail,
as such a force did in Angola this year.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's well-trained and equipped troops are a different matter.
They could easily win battles. But that isn't peacekeeping. Congo
is 215 times the size of Kosovo, Angola 114 times. The terrain is
far more difficult, the fighting a patchwork of skirmishes without
front lines. If some 20,000 NATO troops have found it hard to
prevent murders of Serbs and Albanians in remote Balkan villages,
what could they do in Congo? The United Nations Department of
Peacekeeping Operations told one military analyst in Pretoria that
patrolling Congo would require 100,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   And for how long? And what would they do when they were shot at?
The Congo cease-fire document expects the peacekeepers to disarm
more than a dozen armed forces, including Unita, the Mayi-Mayi
guerrillas and the Hutu militias. Unita has been at war for 25
years. The Mayi-Mayi charge into battle naked, thinking they're
bulletproof. The Hutu militias, if disarmed, would be deported to
Rwanda to be executed for genocide, so it is unlikely that they
will disarm voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there's the ``stomach'' issue. Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, whose troops are fighting in Congo, was recently reported
to be mocking Western peacekeepers. ``Which U.N. troops will stay
in these mountains for six months?'' the Monitor newspaper quoted
him as saying. ``They will just run away like they did in Rwanda.
European soldiers go only to areas where there is no death.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the battle zone is contained, as in the Badme Triangle
between Ethiopia and Eritrea, peacekeepers could be a buffer
between the sides, as in Cyprus or the Golan Heights. But such
situations can be open-ended. Heitman put it this way: ``Cyprus?
The U.N.'s been there since the 60's. And if they left, the Turkish
and Greek Cypriots would go right back to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in Washington, London and Paris know this. They
haven't volunteered troops for Africa and thus far are reluctant to
pay for a United Nations effort.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for a couple of years now, the United States and Europe
have been prodding African countries to form a joint force to calm
the continent's constant crises. Even France, whose Foreign Legion
once aggressively policed its ex-colonies, wants out, said Chris
Landsberg, deputy director of the Center for Policy Studies. Africa
is slowly warming to the idea of a regional joint force, but it's
still all theory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the skittishness of the West infuriates Africans, who
often say it is racism to spend $1.50 per Kosovo refugee but only
11 cents per African refugee. Many African nations like Nigeria and
South Africa say they would be willing to provide the men to do
peace-keeping, but need help paying for them _ lots of help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Post-Somalia, post-Rwanda, the West is able but unwilling, and
Africa is willing but unable,'' said Landsberg. ``Somehow, we have
to convince the West that peace in this area is in their interest.
And then hundreds of millions of dollars has to come from somewhere
_ $20 million here and $20 million there isn't going to do it.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 25, moved Saturday.

<P>
   This final budget adds CLINTON-PROMISES-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   GUN-CONTROL-REVIEW (Undated) _ The perverse effect of gun
control laws: concern about gun violence stirs legislative interest
in gun control; the ensuing controversy energizes demand for guns
among people who fear they may soon disappear from stores;
manufacturers and distributors build up inventories to handle the
new business; gun control measures that eventually pass are deeply
compromised; the result is a net increase in gun ownership. By
David C. Anderson. (Story has moved in `a' category.) WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-JEWS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Iran's arrest of 13 Iranian Jews
on spying charges earlier this year was a menacing sign that bigger
trouble might lie ahead _ trouble that could lead to the last
Jewish community of any size in the Middle East outside Israel
following others into virtual oblivion. A look at the history of
troubles of Jews in Mideastern countries other than Israel. By John
F. Burns. (Story has moved in `i' category.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category (unless otherwise noted)
</P>
<P>
   SEXISM-VOCABULARY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Misogyny, a term referring
to men's hatred of women, has long been in common use, but
misandry, a term referring to women's hatred of men, has not, and
appears in few dictionaries. But misandry is currently being seen,
if not heard, more than ever, reflecting an escalation in the
behavior it describes. Misandrous humor is now politically correct.
By Elin Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   MAKESHIFT-SHRINES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some see kitschy makeshift
shrines for victims of publicized tragedy, such as John Kennedy
Jr., as distasteful exhibitionism, another version of venting on
talk radio or confessing sleazy secrets on daytime TV. Others
believe that our celebrity culture has enabled people to replace
the joy and heartbreak of real intimacy with phony _ and
undemanding _ emotional connections. By Jane Gross.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-RIVALS-REVIEW (Washington) _ For all the accepted wisdom
that George W. Bush will be the Republican presidential nominee,
nine other candidates are persevering and insisting that the race
has not ended before it began. They all (mostly with straight
faces) happily spin scenarios of how they could lasso the prize
Texas longhorn. A look at some possible scenarios. By Richard L.
Berke.
</P>
<P>
   STRIP-SEARCH-REVIEW (New York) _ Recent court decisions
restricting correction officials' authority to conduct strip
searches may force them to rethink a policy that has been effective
in keeping drugs and weapons out of detention centers and reducing
violence in jails. Critics say the officials who authorized
searches later judged illegal either misunderstood, ignored or were
unaware of established legal boundaries defining who could be
strip-searched. By Kevin Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-CAMERAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Why would professional
athletes, who have spent their careers striving for the celebratory
moments that follow a championship victory, opt instead to stand on
the sidelines videotaping teammates as they jump and scream and
enjoy the moment? To these children of the postmodern,
media-drenched age, is recording the mement more important than
being a part of it? By Ed Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   ANTHROPO-ANIMALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Making animals human: Seeing
a highly intelligent creature like a dolphin or a chimpanzee,
people cannot resist imputing to it whatever human feelings would
be appropriate for the context. This is probably part of our
genetic programming. The whole art of living in social groups,
after all, is to figure out the intentions of other members and to
act accordingly. People do this without thinking, and almost any
fellow mammal will trip the reflex. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   TASTELESS-TV-ADS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ One sign of the
coarsening of culture is gross-out TV commercials. An increasing
number of ads follow the same rationale that films and TV shows do:
If you shock with crudeness, lewdness or violence, people pay
attention, especially those who equate frankness with hipness.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PROMISES-REVIEW (Washington) _ President Clinton has
boasted about keeping the promises he made in his first
presidential campaign. An objective examination reveals that he did
reach many of the goals he set in 1992, tried but was thwarted by
political opponents on some, and never even attempted to achieve
others. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-INTERVENTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Suppose the United States
and Europe responded to the charges arising from Africa that they
are indifferent racists willing to spend $1.50 per Kosovo refugee
but only 11 cents per African refugee. Suppose they actually tried
to make peace in an African war. Are there any lessons from Kosovo
that would work in Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone or Eritrea? By

   WASHINGTON _ After his galling defeat by the governor of
Arkansas in 1992, President George Bush became something of an
outcast in his own party. At Republican functions, speakers rattled
on longingly about Ronald Reagan, but never about Bush. It was as
if Republicans had collective amnesia about the man who led their
party and the nation from 1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. The president who was belittled for breaking his
no-new-taxes pledge and ridiculed as a passive in-box president who
dealt only with matters in front of him, is now basking in the glow
of a surprisingly early, and positive, reassessment of his
stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   It is common for Americans to like their presidents better after
they leave office. But the resurgence of respect for Bush _ a view
demonstrated in polls and expressed in interviews with dozens of
Republicans at all levels, and even held by some Democrats _ has
occurred surprisingly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   History books aside, the shift carries more immediate political
implications. Worried that Bush's enhanced stature is helping his
son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, stampede to the Republican
presidential nomination, the governor's foes are trying to tamp
down the reassessment of the Bush presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Just the week before last, President Clinton offered a
not-so-nostalgic recollection of the Bush years in a speech in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   And two of the younger Bush's rivals for the nomination _ Steve
Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher, and Lamar Alexander, a
former secretary of education _ have ridiculed the elder Bush's
slogan about a ``kinder and gentler'' country, in a not-so-subtle
effort to condemn the governor's similarly feel-good slogan of
``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of Americans have a favorable view of the former
president and only 17 percent have an unfavorable view, according
to a CBS News Poll conducted last month.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the adulation Bush enjoyed after the Persian Gulf war,
when his job-approval rating catapulted as high as 90 percent. But
it is far better than the results of a CBS News/New York Times poll
the month before he was ousted by Clinton. Then, Bush was rated
favorably by 35 percent and unfavorably by 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have in retrospect a rosy nostalgic view and warm
feelings toward him,'' said Gary Orren, a professor of public
policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulties that Bill Clinton has had have only amplified
the contrasts: In retrospect he looks even more virtuous. That
George W. is the moon getting a lot of bright light off his father
is something you might not have predicted in November of 1992, when
the economy was bad and there was all the hopefulness about
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many people, particularly Republicans, said that after
the Clinton scandals they have a new appreciation for Bush's
personal rectitude. Many also cited a greater appreciation for his
effort to end the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a familiar refrain among active Republicans, Michael
McDaniel, chairman of the Indiana Republican Party, said, ``Believe
me, there's a big buyer's remorse out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is 75, and his son, 53, appear to be drawing residual
benefit from each other. Governor Bush is so enormously popular in
his party that many Republicans look fondly upon the former
president for being part of his son's winning aura _ even as they
praise the son as a far more relaxed and more natural politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a country that excessively loves winners and we tend
to be hard on presidents who were defeated in office after one
term,'' said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian. ``But
when you have a son who seems the likely favorite to be a
Republican nominee and possibly the next president, it causes
people to look for good things about his father.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a similar dynamic was last in play with the Roosevelts;
people had a much more positive view of Theodore Roosevelt after he
left office, because of the popularity of his cousin, President
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the dynamic works both ways: The younger Bush benefits from
his father's name and reputation; he draws instant credibility as
the son of someone who served in the Oval Office and left
Washington with his integrity intact. (The same factors affect
another Bush son, Jeb, the governor of Florida.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The romanticism of his being the son of a former president
just makes it that much more sexy,'' said Georgette Mosbacher, a
co-chairwoman of Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign whose
former husband, Robert, was Bush's secretary of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Teeter, a pollster in Michigan who ran the 1992 Bush
campaign, said: ``People just automatically say, `If this guy is
George and Barbara Bush's son, we don't have any question about
those personal qualities that we were fooled on by Clinton.' hat's
where his family heritage really works for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for two high-profile parachute jumps, the last in June to
celebrate his 75th birthday, the elder Bush has done nothing to
aggressively reshape his image. Unlike most presidents, he has no
plans to write his memoirs, though he did write a book on foreign
policy with Brent Scowcroft, ``A World Transformed'' (Knopf, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   But if anything, Bush's decision not to speak out about the
transgressions of his successor has probably enhanced his
reputation as an elder statesman who is above politics.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Bush went out of his way not to gloat when
asked to comment for this article. ``I am unfamiliar with the
polling numbers you talked about,'' Bush said in a typewritten note
faxed from his home in Kennebunkport, Maine. ``But if what you say
is true _ well, that is very nice. Since leaving the White House, I
have tried hard to stay out of the limelight. I also have not tried
to shape history. I will leave it up to the historians and
academics to figure all that out. What I hope they will say is that
we got some things right, made some mistakes, but served with
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Kaufman, who was Bush's political director in the White
House and is still his political adviser, said there had been a
dramatic rise in requests for the former president to appear at
party functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '93, we'd get maybe two or three requests a month, max,
like `Can he do the Lincoln Day speech for the Harris County
Republican Party in Texas?''' Kaufman said. ``I'd get calls, `Do
you think the president would mind asking his son if he'd be the
speaker?' But this year, I probably get from 25 to 30 requests a
week for him to be the headliner at events like the Republican
National Committee's annual gala.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not as adored as Reagan in his party. There are still
lingering hard feelings from the 1992 campaign; a month before that
election Bush was faring so poorly that only two dozen of more than
400 Republican congressional candidates accepted Bush's offer to
appear in campaign videos with him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his improved popularity may come as much from moderates
as from hard-core conservatives who never quite trusted Bush as a
genuine conservative _ and still do not. ``I think he's a more
beloved figure in the country than in the party,'' Teeter said.
``It's the marginal, more independent Republicans who look back and
say, `Gee, compared to Clinton, he's wonderful.'''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted in March for Fox television found that if the
1992 election were held now _ certainly a fanciful notion _ Bush
would draw 58 percent of the vote, and Clinton 37 percent. But it
is impossible to decipher the accuracy of a survey that asks people
to re-evaluate how they voted. For all anyone knows, respondents
were confusing Bush with his son, who has dominated the political
news for months.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent speech, Clinton did not mention his predecessor by
name, but clearly sought to dash any fond memories of the Bush era.
``We may have to remind our fellow citizens in times to come just
what it was like back then,'' Clinton said. ``How high the
unemployment was, how stagnant the wages were, how steeply growing
the inequality was, how fast the social conditions were
worsening.''
</P>
<P>
   The efforts to link the younger Bush with his father are
inevitable because of the similarities between the two men. They
both have sought to take any harsh edge off their Republican
principles. They both toiled in the Texas oil business. But while
the elder Bush had long expertise in foreign policy and federal
matters, the governor's has been limited to state government.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference, cited by many Republicans, is that
Governor Bush's hands-on, wade-into-the-crowd campaigning style
more resembles Clinton's than that of President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. has that Clintonesque, Reaganesque ability of
relating to people that was George Sr.'s major problem,'' said Mike
Kiedrowski, executive director of the Republican Party in Montana.
``He's much more like Ronald Reagan than his father. But in
retrospect President Bush has gained over the years. I may not
agree with every policy, certainly not the '90 tax increase. But he
was a good leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Van Devender, a Republican national committeeman from
Mississippi, said of the younger Bush, ``He's got all the
attributes of his dad, but his son can do it a lot better.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the midst of the bitter debate last week over
the Republican tax bills moving through Congress, it was easy to
lose sight of the emerging consensus in both parties that there
should be a tax cut this year.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is where the middle ground on taxes might be _
and how the White House and Congress can get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tax cut waiting to happen,'' said Rep. Michael
Castle, R-Del., who favors a compromise smaller than the $792
billion package passed by the House last week but bigger than the
$300 million or so that President Clinton has said he can support.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted that a tax reduction would have to await
progress in shoring up Social Security and Medicare, and that it
could not be so big as to starve domestic spending programs or risk
a return to federal budget deficits. But he made clear that he was
open to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not debating whether to have tax cuts or not,'' Clinton
told a news conference on Wednesday. ``We should have tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, a compromise package of tax cuts totaling
$400 billion to $500 billion over the next decade would not seem
difficult to work out. From among the array of proposals contained
in the bill passed by the House on Thursday and a bill scheduled to
be taken up by the Senate _ as well as from ideas backed by
Democrats _ there are plenty of options for addressing both party's
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But before they get to that point, both sides will have to
decide that they want a deal more than they want to use the issue
to campaign on in the 2000 elections. They will have to fit an
agreement on taxes into a broader compromise covering spending
levels and the future of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they decide to negotiate seriously, working out a
tax deal will be far more difficult than simply splitting the
difference, because their respective approaches reflect an
ideological clash as much as a dispute over the size of any tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and most Democrats in Congress want any tax cuts to be
directed at low- and moderate-income households, and to be linked
to some specific purpose, like promoting more retirement savings or
helping to subsidize the purchase of health or long-term care
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want the tax reductions to be spread more broadly.
In practice, their plans would give the biggest cuts to the people
who pay the most in taxes _ the affluent _ and reduce taxes not
just on income but on wealth, through reductions in capital gains
taxes and the inheritance tax levied on large estates.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by the Treasury Department of the House tax bill
found that 79.6 percent of the benefits would go to taxpayers with
the highest 20 percent of income, above $81,967. A third would go
to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, those with income above
$346,555.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury analysis looked at the effects of the House bill's
main provisions, including the 10 percent reduction in personal
income tax rates, the reduction in the top rate on capital gains to
15 percent from 20 percent, the repeal of the estate tax and the
increase in the standard deduction for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their tax cut is all over the lot, and most of it goes to the
top 10 percent of earners,'' said Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, the House Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said the people who have been most overtaxed are
those who earn the most. They cited figures showing that taxpayers
earning $200,000 and over _ about 2 percent of the population _ pay
40 percent of income taxes. People earning over $75,000 a year,
they said, make up 15 percent of the population but pay 75 percent
of income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are determined to protect taxpayers who ultimately
get stuck with the bills,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who is
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some areas where the two sides can clearly
reach a deal. Democrats generally support proposals contained in
both the House and the Senate bills to reduce the so-called
marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that leaves many
two-income couples paying more in taxes than they would if they
were single.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats favor the approach in the House bill. It would
increase the standard deduction for married couples to twice that
for single people, thereby focusing the benefits on lower- and
middle-income couples rather than wealthier couples who would
almost invariably itemize their deductions. The provision would
cost about $45 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both parties see the marriage penalty as something they have
to do,'' said Richard May, a former Republican staff director of
the House Budget Committee, who is now a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   There is also widespread bipartisan support for tax breaks for
buying health insurance. Both the House and the Senate bills have
health provisions, totaling around $50 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties favor extending a series of expiring tax
provisions, including one that provides a break for research and
development expenses. Both bills contain $20 billion for the
expiring provisions.
</P>
<P>
   But finding agreement on the biggest provisions in the
Republican proposals _ reducing income tax rates, capital gains
taxes, the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax _ would be
tricky at best.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate bills have as their centerpieces
reductions in personal income taxes. The House bill would reduce by
10 percent the rates for all income tax brackets at a cost of about
$375 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   After 2001, the tax-rate cuts in the House bill would take
effect only if interest payments on the national debt were not
rising.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would cut the current bottom bracket of 15
percent to 14 percent and expand the bracket to higher income
levels. The provision, which would cost about $300 billion over 10
years, would focus much of the benefit on middle-income taxpayers,
making it far more palatable to Democrats than the House version.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, analysts said, if an income tax reduction is
included in any compromise it would almost certainly be closer to
the Senate version than the House version. The two sides could also
fall back on a more modest rate reduction proposed by a group of
Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rate cuts tend to be very expensive,'' said Robert Reischauer,
a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now a
fellow at the Brookings Institution. ``If they have a life, it's
most certainly in the form the Senate is putting forward.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little support among Democrats for a cut in the capital
gains tax, but with the investor class growing ever larger and the
stock market heading ever higher, opposition from Democrats is far
more muted than it used to be. Democrats are likely to be
assertive, however, in attacking Republican proposals to repeal or
sharply scale back the tax on large estates, saying such a cut
would confer huge benefits on a tiny handful of heirs for decades
to come.
</P>
<P>
   The degree to which Republicans prevail on their tax-cutting
priorities may depend on how far they prove willing to go in giving
in to Clinton in other areas, particularly the administration's
call for a new prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients
and its insistence on using part of the projected budget surplus
for spending on education, health and other domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's going to be a grand compromise on taxes,'' May
said, ``there's going to have to be a bigger, grander compromise on
discretionary spending and on prescription drugs.''

<P>
   CENTERVILLE, Mass. _ Cory Sinclair, 17, was scooping ice cream
at the Four Seas as fast as he could and talking about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be president,'' he said. ``I'm serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly O'Neil, 18, had more prosaic concerns. ``I'm sorry, we
don't have jimmies,'' she informed a customer. (As any Four Seas
regular knows, jimmies don't belong on good ice cream.)
</P>
<P>
   Mixing up a batch of coconut, Bryan Schlegel, 22, was feeling
restless and wistful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to move on,'' he said. ``I've been here six
summers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seas, a white cottage with blue shutters and a white
formica counter with 12 blue stools, has been an institution on
South Main Street of this Cape Cod village for 65 summers.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Richard Warren, 64, who has been on the job for 45
years, makes what is indisputably delicious ice cream. He uses
fresh peaches, strawberries, blueberries and ginger, expensive
chocolate and loads of butter cream, and he tastes every batch
himself. He does not add candy or try bizarre flavors.
</P>
<P>
   But what also distinguishes the Four Seas is the help.
</P>
<P>
   Summer after summer, the young men and women behind the counter
seem as unchanging as the decor, the ice cream and the oldies on
the radio. They are clean-cut and sport no visible tattoos or
strange piercing. They are alert and polite, even when the
customers are rude.
</P>
<P>
   They are the class presidents, newspaper editors and honor roll
regulars from Barnstable High School who have been handpicked by
Warren, a retired math teacher and guidance counselor there.
</P>
<P>
   They start serving up cones at 16, and they stay through
college, ending their careers _ and career is the word they use _
as ice cream makers and managers, like Schlegel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best job you can get on the Cape,'' said Tava Ohlsen,
18, who graduated at the top of her class in June, plans to go to
medical school and moved up this summer from ice cream scooper to
sandwich maker. ``People say, `Oh, you work at the Four Seas.
You're a good student; you're good with people.'''
</P>
<P>
   From the week before Memorial Day until the week after Labor
Day, the staff races from the counter to the ice cream and back to
keep up with the crowds. There are higher paying summer jobs _ the
Four Seas is minimum wage, with tips bringing it to about $10 an
hour _ but Warren never has any trouble finding help.
</P>
<P>
   He solicits recommendations from the faculty at Barnstable High,
and summons those with the highest ratings for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's known that you can't apply,'' Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   To be called by Warren is to become a member of his extended
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a second dad,'' said Jahni Clarke, 19. ``I tell him
about everything, from school to money to my love life.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of every summer Warren throws a staff party, with
dinner and a live band. He organizes an all-expenses-paid ski
weekend in New Hampshire every winter. He writes his employees'
college recommendations, and when they get to college, he visits
them.
</P>
<P>
   He brings ice cream to their weddings (romance, predictably,
blooms behind the counter, and there have been seven Four Seas
marriages so far).
</P>
<P>
   He has periodic reunions; at the last one, in 1988, only four
Four Seas alums, out of more than 200, were not able to make it.
</P>
<P>
   Warren is married, with four grown children. Each season he
gives out scholarships totaling several thousand dollars in memory
of his son Randy, who was killed in 1983 when he was hit by a car
while crossing the street in Fort Lauderdale. He was 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never close to my dad,'' said Warren, who was talking
the other day between greeting customers and making ice cream. ``He
was 46 when I was born. I longed for a relationship with my
children. Randy and I were so close. We won the state father-son
golf tournament. We'd ski all day, play tennis till we dropped. He
wanted to run this place someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy lives on, in a way, Warren said, in the young people who
work beside him each summer. ``Bryan is like a son,'' he said as he
and Schlegel poured frozen pudding ice cream into cartons. ``We
just played in the father-son golf tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlegel graduated this spring from the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst. He was recently called for an interview
in the customer service department of a Boston investment banking
firm. By fall, he said, he hopes to have a permanent job.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clarke, who is a junior at the University of
Massachusetts, just moved up to manager. ``I'm the first black
manager,'' said Clarke, who was freshman class president and editor
of the newspaper at Barnstable High, which is mostly white.
</P>
<P>
   Things do change at the Four Seas. As hard-working as his 25
employees are, Warren said that most do not want to put in the
hours that previous generations did.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need the money as much,'' he said, adding that
whereas workers from summers past arrived on foot or by bicycle, or
were dropped off by their parents, almost all of the employees now
drive their own cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest change, the one everyone is talking about, is
that Warren's son Doug, 36, is back from Las Vegas, where he had
been running a restaurant and selling computer software. The plan
is for him to take over the ice cream parlor. The elder Warren is
talking about retiring in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   His staff is skeptical. ``The chief will never retire,'' Miss
O'Neil said.

 &HT;    `African-american' entrenched in national lexicon, 10 years
later
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the descendants of American slaves, a name was
always more than just a name. The skin-deep aspects of their racial
identity can be traced like tree rings to the terms used to
describe them.
</P>
<P>
   The n-word was supposed to be an insult, first used like a lash
to demean and defeat. Colored seemed like an upgrade of sorts,
until it was replaced by ``Afro-American,'' which for many referred
to a hairstyle, not a heritage. And for those who were around in
the late 1960s and '70s, black was not only beautiful, it was
revolutionary as well.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1988 the Rev. Jesse Jackson publicly urged blacks to
stop playing the name game, and to once and for all declare
themselves African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Some dismissed Jackson's suggestion as a linguistic fad. A 1991
poll by the Joint Center for Economic and Policy Studies, a
Washington-based think tank, found the term ``black'' was still
preferred over ``African-American'' by nearly 5 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   When 279 respondents of African descent were asked by The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Southern Focus Poll which term they
prefer, their opinions went beyond the shifting racial lexicon to
the very heart of their dual, if distant, birthright.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, about 33 percent of those who answered said they
would rather be called black while 44 percent said they favored
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Their counterparts outside the South preferred African-American
(51 percent) to black (27 percent). Regardless of geography, about
one-fifth of respondents said they didn't know, or didn't care what
they were called.
</P>
<P>
   Age, however, seemed to play some role. Among the Southern
respondents, 52 percent of people ages 18 to 29 picked
African-American, while roughly the same percentage 65 and older
opted for black.
</P>
<P>
   Rocena Parker, a 19-year-old student at the University of
Memphis, was only 8 when Jackson made his pitch and doesn't
remember the tempest it created. Still, there's no question which
term is right for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like African-American better because it tells me where I
come from, my origin and my ethnic background,'' said the poll
respondent. ``To me, African-American is just stronger than
black.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker said when filling out applications which inquire about
her race, she'll often write the letters ``A-f-A,'' her own
shorthand for African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they say: You don't know where you're going unless
you know where you've been,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson gets most of the credit for coining the term
African-American, that distinction rightly belongs to people such
as Ramona Edelin. A scholar and activist, Edelin piped up with the
idea in the waning hours of a black leadership meeting Jackson
convened in Chicago more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us in the group had already decided to refer to
ourselves as African-American because we wanted to establish the
correct geopolitical basis for our agenda,'' said the former
African-American studies professor, who now serves as director of
the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Inc. in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think we should still be hanging on to the polar
opposites of white and black. For me, African-American was a
compromise word that enabled us in the movement to embrace both of
our cultural realities.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelin recalled that everyone in the meeting agreed with the
change.
</P>
<P>
   But she was surprised by how easily the term actually caught on.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first people trivialized it, but 18 months later we looked
up and everyone was using it on the networks and in newspapers. I
was getting calls about it from London and Brussels and all over
the world about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, African-American was a term whose time had come.
</P>
<P>
   Flush from two credible presidential bids, Jackson was a
charismatic media darling to major print and broadcast outlets who
were often grappling with minority hiring issues in their own
newsrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of Washington and at college campuses around the
country, South African political prisoner Nelson Mandela had become
a cause celebre, and his struggle for freedom helped establish a
kinship between the two continents that never existed before.
</P>
<P>
   And on prime-time television ``The Cosby Show'' and ``In Living
Color'' _ two shows with predominantly black casts _ ruled the
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there was anything special about that period,
but the whole country came to value multiculturalism as a social
ideal in a way we clearly did not in the 1950s,'' said John
McWhorter, an associate professor of linguistics at the University
of California, Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   While African-American appears to have become more popular, it
is still used interchangeably with black, even though the words
don't always have the same meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Some consider African-American too unwieldy for everyday speech.
Others say it doesn't encompass the far-flung diversity of blacks
whose families immigrated to America from other places, such as the
West Indies. But there's little doubt that the term has been widely
embraced, and it's showing no signs of falling from favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up it was an insult to call someone
black,'' said Bob Spinks, a 55-year-old high school teacher and
poll participant from Oklahoma City. ``When you use the terms black
and white, it sets up inferior and superior connotations in your
mind. But with African-American, you're associating your blackness
with something positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Darren Rhym of Clark Atlanta University agrees that
the term black is no longer pejorative, but he's concerned that the
growing acceptance of the term African-American marks an
abandonment of hard-fought ideals forged during the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when you said 'black' you were making a
political statement, you were saying you were tied to the black
power movement. It had almost a militant tone,'' says Rhym. ``Now I
think blacks are less politicized. The students I see are more
concerned with wanting to integrate. They don't want to stand out
and could care less about the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   New generation, new realities
</P>
<P>
   Professor Sonja Lanehart, a professor of English Studies and
Linguistics at the University of Georgia, sees the change more as a
matter of pragmatism, not politics. She believes the term
African-American has become the standard for a generation that's
still proud of its racial heritage, but doesn't want to beat anyone
over the head with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-American is a less contentious term,'' says Lanehart.
``The term 'black' seemed very strong and forceful, it was a term
of strength that intimidated some people. African-Americans in
positions of power are often interacting with people they are not
in conflict with. They want a term that says, `I'm different, but
I'm somebody you can get along with.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the term African-American has become commonplace in
everyday speech, it's had a harder time making the cut in
mainstream reference books.
</P>
<P>
   The Third Edition of Webster's New World Collegiate Dictionary
published in 1996 has no listing for African-American. Their
competitors, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, last year listed
African-American as a sub-heading to Afro-American, a term which is
all but passe in everyday speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very careful about including words that pop in and out
of the language,'' said Deborah Burns, marketing director for
Merriam-Webster in Springfield, Mass. ``African-American was being
used widely, and often enough that we thought it met the
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Many newspapers use both terms, usually depending on context.
The term African-American first appeared in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's stylebook in 1995 as an alternative to
black. The newspaper's 1998 stylebook lists black as ``acceptable,
but not preferred over African- American.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who are having trouble making up their minds, the U.S.
Census Bureau will for the first time include the term
African-American on questionnaires for the 2000 Census along with
``Black'' and ``Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted something for everyone,'' says Nampeo McKenney, a
senior researcher for the Census Bureau. ``More people are using
African-American, but we know from our research that there are
still people, particularly older people, who still call themselves
Negro or colored.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the choice over which term to use was never much in
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   J. Lowell Ware, the late publisher of the Atlanta Voice
newspaper, was considered a pioneer for adopting the term
African-American in the late 1970s. His daughter Janis Ware runs
the paper now, and says the policy is still intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my father's mind, black was only a color,'' Ware said.
``Black says nothing about us, and I don't use the term at all
unless I'm talking about black furniture or a black outfit. I don't
think we've ever used black in our newspaper to refer to a person,
and I don't think we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta author Pearl Cleage is trilingual when it comes to her
preferred term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still even use Negro sometimes,'' says Cleage. ``In a way I
think what we call each other is less important than how we act. If
we love each other and treat each other with respect that's what
really matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleage admits that she occasionally uses ``nigger,'' a word so
dreaded and controversial that it has its own euphemism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like saying 'the n-word,' it sounds silly,'' Cleage
said. ``Within our own community, we use the word in its own
context and I'm all right with that. But I wouldn't say it with
other people outside of our community. When we say it, we know what
it means.''
</P>
<P>
   To Jackson the ability of a community to choose its own identity
is the first step in determining its destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our psyche was so crushed at one time that we were ashamed of
Africa,'' Jackson said in a telephone interview. ``To call someone
African used to be demeaning. But I think the term African-American
is sticking because our psyche has been globalized. We are saying
our heritage did not originate in slavery. We are saying, 'We are
citizens of the world.'''

ROCK GROUP TAKES ON A `GOOD OLD BOY NETWORK'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (jw) 
 By TOM LASSETER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ A grass-roots campaign against a local hospital's
plan to expand into surrounding neighborhoods here has all the
hallmarks of civic activism that this college town is known for:
yard signs, petitions, meetings, protests and, of course, the
support of one of the world's most successful rock bands, R.E.M.
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M.'s involvement in local affairs has been a staple for so
long that when its lead singer and most politically active member,
Michael Stipe, showed up for a community meeting with officials
from the Athens Regional Medical Center in late April, there was no
murmur from the crowd and only a few heads turned.
</P>
<P>
   Stipe has referred to the hospital's growth plan as an example
of `` '80s era Reagan-style aggression.'' And so it came as no
surprise when this month the band gave a check for $2,500 to the
recently organized Citizens for Healthy Neighborhoods. The band's
lawyer and manager, Bertis Downs, had already told the group that
R.E.M. would pay the bill for the best lawyer it could find.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who is talking, R.E.M. is either Athens' best
corporate citizen or one of the biggest bullies to hit town since
the Union army.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming together as four university undergraduates in 1981,
the band has never really left this community of 90,000, which
includes 30,000 students at the University of Georgia. Two of the
band's members, Stipe and Mike Mills, still live here, and it is
generally acknowledged as a serious social faux pas to make a scene
if one sights, say, Stipe walking his dog or talking with a friend
at a local bar.
</P>
<P>
   World headquarters for the band, which has sold more than 40
million records and is in the third year of an $80 million contract
with Warner Brothers Music, the biggest company in the industry,
are above a cookie shop downtown.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Bologna, Italy, one of the band's
stops on its summer tour, Stipe said he wanted Athens to remain, as
much as possible, the sort of place it was when he moved here.
``It's home. That's something that most Americans hold close,''
Stipe said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the weight of its wealth and reputation, Stipe said,
R.E.M. is able to act as a check to what he sees as the ``good old
boy network'' of conservative politicians and developers,
especially on issues involving historic preservation and the
environment. ``I think they're terrified of me because I'm
different,'' said Stipe, a multimillionaire who keeps his head
shaved, often dresses in clothes that might have come from a thrift
store and has been known to paint his fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Some locals said that the band, led by Stipe, who describes
himself as ``an unashamed liberal,'' was too aggressive in setting
its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average citizen does not realize how much funding R.E.M.
has put into political campaigns in Athens,'' said Marilyn Farmer,
one of two Republicans on the local commission. ``They have an
attitude of ultimately trying to control what happens in Athens
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The band was referred to as the R.E.M. mafia in some local
circles in 1989 when it stepped into a debate on how the civic
center would be designed. Stipe, along with many other critics,
said he thought the architect's draft was too obtrusive for the
rustic downtown district.
</P>
<P>
   When it seemed the city's leadership would not listen, R.E.M.
paid $5,000 for a consultant to review the plans. From that point
the tide began to turn and the center's plan soon became less
modern and ended up incorporating an existing fire hall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   R.E.M.'s next big entry into local politics came in 1990, when
the residents of Athens and the surrounding county, Clarke, voted
to unify their governments. The ensuing mayoral election was
recognized as a pivotal moment in the region's history.
</P>
<P>
   The underdog, a liberal and a former City Council member, Gwen
O'Looney, was not thought to have much of a chance to win since the
local government was run largely by conservative Democrats. That
changed when the band put its support behind Mrs. O'Looney, who
said she wasn't sure if she wanted to run until R.E.M. promised to
raise at least $10,000 for her.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the race, which Mrs. O'Looney won, the band and
its management, giving as individuals, accounted for almost
one-third of Mrs. O'Looney's campaign fund, donating $14,285 of the
approximately $43,000 she collected, according to her financial
disclosure statements.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, the band's members and management contributed
$3,000 to a successful campaign by John Barrow for a seat on the
newly unified commission. The money constituted more than one-third
of the approximately $8,000 Barrow collected. Also, the group gave
$1,500 to the successful commission campaign of Cardee Kilpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   Barrow became the acknowledged gadfly of the unified
government's commission. He and Mrs. Kilpatrick would often align
themselves with Mrs. O'Looney, who lives on the same street as
Downs, the band manager, and only a few blocks from Stipe, to push
for historic preservation and environmentally friendly measures.
</P>
<P>
   In a county where the average per capita income is about
$21,000, Stipe today owns, including his home, $953,348 in property
in a three-block area, according to the Athens-Clarke County tax
assessor's records.
</P>
<P>
   The band members' money means they are not subject to local
influence, said Pete McCommons, publisher of Flagpole magazine, a
local alternative publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their money is independent of Athens,'' he said. ``Nobody can
touch them. Nobody can pick up the phone and say, `Fire them.' They
are untouchable.''

TO GYPSIES, CZECH SPECIAL SCHOOLS ARE A LESSON IN BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Before he went to school, the
5-year-old Gypsy boy could read. In fact, he liked reading so much
that his teachers complained that he paid more attention to his
books than to what was going on in his classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, teachers decided that the boy, Lada Hejkrlik,
was ``mentally deficient,'' and recommended his transfer to a
school for children whose ability to learn is impaired.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Jana Hejkrlikova, was outraged. To her, it was a
clear case of racial discrimination, part of a long pattern of
Czech bias against the Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher told me, `Your child just cannot keep up, we'll
send him to a special school,''' said Mrs. Hejkrlikova. ``She told
me he was preconditioned for it.''
</P>
<P>
   It took her six months to persuade an army of psychologists and
education consultants that her son was perfectly capable of
studying at an ordinary school.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lada is in his 20s, a senior at a technical college.
Without his mother's intervention, his career prospects could have
been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hejkrlikova is now a member of the Czech Republic's state
commission for minority rights, a panel established after Communist
rule collapsed in 1989 and a growing number of racist incidents
led, gradually, to discussion of the situation of the 300,000
Gypsies estimated to live in the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Central and Eastern Europe, the Gypsies were
persecuted, imprisoned and killed by the Nazis, then virtually
ignored under the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries, they are widely viewed as uneducated and
prone to crime, living in poor housing and inherently nomadic.
</P>
<P>
   In the Czech Republic, there are not even any statistics about
Gypsies. But by some estimates about half of their schoolchildren
attend schools intended to deal with retarded children, or special
schools intended primarily for pupils with an IQ below 50.
</P>
<P>
   According to a research study published by the European Roma
Rights Center, a human rights organization based in Budapest,
Hungary, the Czech educational system shows signs of widespread
segregation and discrimination against Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that a Gypsy child is at least 15 times more
likely to be labeled mentally retarded than a Czech pupil.
</P>
<P>
   Once transferred into the special schools, the students' chances
of further education are reduced to virtually zero. Special school
graduates are not eligible to enter high school, because of their
limited curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gypsies sent to special school get the equivalent of an
educational death sentence,'' said James Goldston, the Budapest
Center's legal director.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents are beginning to speak up. On June 15, 12 Gypsy
families filed a complaint with the Czech Constitutional Court to
challenge their children's segregation in special schools.
</P>
<P>
   They also filed a lawsuit against the regional education board
in Ostrava, a drab industrial region in the north of the Czech
Republic that has become the site of frequent racist incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Debbie Winterbourne, a lawyer for the
Budapest-based Roma center, said that her organization planned to
file a complaint at the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg, France, later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Class action does not exist under Czech jurisdiction. But local
lawyers, activists and the Budapest-based center all hope that the
case might benefit all Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have other children and this can happen to any of them,''
said Berta Cervenakova, one of the 12 plaintiffs. ``And I am not
fighting just for my kids. I do this for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Nikol, 10, was transferred last year to a special
school despite a report card that shows her grades were sufficient
for normal education.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-two percent of her current classmates in the special
school are Gypsy.
</P>
<P>
   The parents demand formal acknowledgment from the Czech
government that they were denied equal opportunity in education and
that they have been victims of racial discrimination and
segregation, which violates Czech as well as international law.
They also request compensatory education for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the lawsuit was filed, representatives of the
regional education board invited Mrs. Cervenakova and the other
parents to take their children back to a regular elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   A written statement from the Education Ministry asserts that the
charges of segregation and racial discrimination are unfounded
since children can be transferred to special schools only with
parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Budapest center suggests that parents are
often actively persuaded by teachers and psychologists into signing
the transfer to a special school without understanding the possible
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parental consent is a red herring, an attempt to blame the
victims for their suffering,'' Goldston said.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsy parents who may have been through a special school say
they find it hard to resist the authorities. Some even welcome the
move, saying their children are less likely to be taunted by
non-Gypsy pupils.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what it's like when your child comes home crying
without a cap every single day, and it's freezing outside?'' Mrs.
Cervenakova said. ``The kids were calling Nikol `dirty Gypsy' and
the teacher was just putting more pressure on her. She was scared
to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   But special schools do not necessarily shield Gypsy children
from racist abuse. Mrs. Hejkrlikova described a recent incident.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a special school teacher ordered two 9-year-old Gypsy
boys to strip naked before their Czech classmates. She searched
them for 50 crowns, the equivalent of $1.40, she assumed they had
stolen, Mrs. Hejkrlikova said. Gypsies had to complain many times
before the education board investigated and finally gave her a
verbal reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   In a report on protection of national minorities, submitted to
the Council of Europe this year, the Czech government noted that
the public, as well as many police officers and other
law-enforcement officials, often play down racist incidents,
leaving offenders either unpunished or with light sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The level of violence against Gypsies in the Czech Republic, and
neighboring Slovakia, has already set off several waves of highly
publicized immigration to Canada, France, Britain and, most
recently, Finland, where 100 Czech Gypsies are awaiting word on
whether they will be granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example of trouble came in the northern town of Most,
where the local Gypsy leadership this month said that its
population was ``seriously jeopardized by violent attacks by
skinheads'' who it said ``increasingly terrorize them and attack
their homes at night.''

 &HT;    Patients set better treatment by HMOs as top priority
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It took seven months of experimentation and
exasperation for Bob Montgomery to find the right combination of
medicines to control his Parkinson's disease. Which ones would
work? How much? When?
</P>
<P>
   ``And you've got no idea of the frustration,'' he said. ``Can
you imagine being out on a golf course with three of your friends,
and all of a sudden you medication wears off? I'd have my left hand
on the golf club, and when I tried to put my right hand on it, I
couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery thinks the world of his local neurologist. That
doctor had helped him regulate his medication. But Parkinson's is a
complicated disease, and before he joined his HMO, Montgomery saw a
subspecialist at the Ohio State University Parkinson's center known
as one of the best in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now he'd like to see them both, the Columbus doctor no more than
once or twice a year. But the Columbus doctor isn't part of his
HMO's local network, so Montgomery has to pay that bill himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I shouldn't pay more to see someone who's out
of the network,'' said Montgomery, who's otherwise healthy at 67.
``But I shouldn't be denied access to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a majority of Americans, Montgomery thinks HMO members need
some government protection to keep their health plans from making
too many decisions that are more pleasing to accountants than to
physicians. But when the U.S. Senate passed its
Republican-sponsored ``Patients' Bill of Rights Plus'' 10 days ago,
consumer advocates and physicians' organizations harshly criticized
the bill for not living up to its title.
</P>
<P>
   House legislation on health plans is still in committees, and
President Clinton has promised to veto the Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   Access to disease-focused specialists, rarely granted by any
HMO, was one of several rights missing from the Senate bill. The
most publicized exclusion was the right to sue an HMO that doesn't
pay for services a doctor recommends, but also omitted were an
enforceable independent review process and prohibitions against
punishing a doctor for advocating on his patient's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that happens, said a Montgomery County doctor who told an
HMO its member had too much pain and not enough blood pressure to
be sent home from the hospital. The HMO responded that the doctor's
standing in its network would have to be re-evaluated if the
patient were not sent home, which is why the doctor asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill included some provisions hardly anyone beefed
about. It protected most Americans from losing health coverage
because their genes signal future diseases. It also made health
plan premiums fully tax deductible for the self-employed, and
long-term care insurance tax deductible when an employer doesn't
subsidize.
</P>
<P>
   Americans want stronger protections from health plans than were
passed by the Senate, polls indicate. Kaiser Family Foundation
surveys have been steady for the past two years on their support
for the rights to file HMO malpractice suits, to have complaints
reviewed independently and to thorough coverage of specialists'
care. In April's survey, released last week, the results showed 70
percent in favor of the right to sue, 83 percent for reviews and 77
percent for specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The figures tend to drop at least 20 points when people are
asked how they'd feel if it made their annual premium $200 higher,
but civil liability was still favored by a 49 percent plurality,
and the review and specialist stipulations still had majorities
more than 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, the Kaiser Foundation found that five out of
every eight managed care members are at least somewhat worried
their plans would care more about cost than quality if they were
sick, and the August issue of Consumer Reports suggests they're
right to worry. In its poll of 19,000 HMO members, CR found only
one-third of those who were ill were very or completely satisfied
with their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the insurance companies are taking advantage of the
public,'' said Montgomery, a longtime insurance agent whose sons
now run Montgomery Insurance and Investment Agency. ``They do it by
making the rules and regulations so strict and not paying claims
when they're supposed to. It's the big insurance company and little
you, so a lot of people will give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're not going to get any help from the government,
because the insurance companies have got the politicians in their
hip pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates were just slightly more diplomatic after the
Senate passed its bill, which executive director Ron Pollack of
Families USA called, ``insurance industry protections, not patient
protections.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports likened the status of health care information
to that of information on products 30 years ago, before labels
divulged the nutritional content of food, energy efficiency of
appliances and plain-English costs of everything from groceries to
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Even the health insurance industry's gloating after the Senate
vote was about its media blitz opposing extensive reforms, and not
about any business practices that made those reforms unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business people who
aligned with the insurance industry, called the limited reforms
``victories for business, the economy and the fight to reduce the
rising number of uninsured in America.'' An Ohio Republican
congressional aide said the broader Democratic-sponsored reforms
would have had a ``disastrous effect'' on working people by driving
up premiums and forcing employers to drop coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But the government watchdog organization Public Citizen said the
right to sue an HMO would have cost a typical health plan less than
60 percent of what at least one of them pays its top five
executives, based on Congressional Budget Office estimates. Public
Citizen said health plans spent $37.5 million lobbying Congress in
1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me absolutely furious that this was defeated because
of politics,'' said Kathy Gerding of Centerville. ``We need to be
able to sue health plans. The way it is now, I can't even get them
to return a phone call about my 7-month-old baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Since she sent her first letter to Anthem Blue Cross and Blue
Shield on April 25, Gerding said she hasn't been able to get claim
denials in writing and had her phone calls returned only once. That
was the morning after she was on television celebrating the passage
in committee of Ohio House Bill 218, which would require health
plans to pay for any medically life-sustaining infant formula
prescribed by a doctor. Her daughter cannot tolerate milk, soy or
protein.
</P>
<P>
   Few health plans cover those special formulas, although Gerding
says welfare recipients on Medicaid have that coverage. The plans
are only carrying out limitations imposed by employers who pay most
of the premiums, say officials at both Anthem and United Health
Care, the other dominant local HMO. But Gerding and consumer
advocates at least want someone other than the HMOs, with their
incentive not to spend money, interpreting what is and is not
medically needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we sue too much in this country,'' Gerding said. ``But
if that possibility exists, it will make them say, `You are a
customer. We are going to take care of you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, HMOs are ``basically responsive only to their
stockholders,'' said Dr. Richard Reiling, a Kettering surgeon who
has withdrawn his longtime Republican support over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' proposals probably would have been too
restrictive, said Dr. Norman Schneiderman, who directs Miami Valley
Hospital's emergency and trauma center. But he said patients need
more protection than the Senate passed ``because there are some
managed care plans that really are not going to do the right thing
unless you're forced to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He called it typically Washingtonian that Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.) squelched a request to let a bipartisan group
of moderate senators come up with a compromise. ``I really feel the
leaders in this country are more interested in how they look to
their constituents than doing the right thing for the country,''
Schneiderman said.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting Senate bill was a collection of partial
concessions to consumer demand that will ``actually do more harm
than good,'' said Adrienne Hahn, Consumers Union's legislative
counsel. For example, according to consumer and medical groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ It provides for independent review of HMO coverage decisions,
but the review boards are paid and chosen by HMOs and an HMO risks
no more than a $10,000 fine by refusing to comply with the board's
decision _ which might be that the HMO must pay for a $30,000
surgery. Hahn said the provision undermines 18 states' laws that
require review by boards fully independent of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   _ It covers the 48 million Americans in employer-funded health
plans exempt from state laws, but most other provisions don't apply
to the 113 million other Americans in health plans.
</P>
<P>
   _ It requires HMOs to cover all cases that reasonable people
would call an emergency, but it doesn't limit co-payments and
doesn't guarantee coverage after the patient's life is out of
danger.
</P>
<P>
   _ It guarantees access to experimental treatments for cancer
patients, but not for anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   _ It assures patients who are pregnant, institutionalized or in
the middle of a treatment of keeping their doctors even if they
leave the HMO's network, but only for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   _ It sets minimum hospital stays for mastectomy patients, but
keeps most determinations of medical necessity in the hands of
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   _ It doesn't allow HMOs to forbid doctors from discussing all
their health options with patients, but it doesn't keep HMOs from
punishing doctors and other professionals for sticking up for their
patients or going public with unsafe practices. Nor does it curb
financial incentives to doctors for seeing more patients,
prescribing fewer drugs and making fewer referrals.
</P>
<P>
   _ It requires access to specialists ``in a timely matter'' but
doesn't stipulate how specialized or convenient those doctors must
be.
</P>
<P>
   Even timely access would be an improvement for many, according
to research by the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.
Nearly a quarter of patients in California HMOs ``had difficulty
getting referrals to specialty care,'' said the report last week in
the American Medical Association journal JAMA. And the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation recently announced its finding that since 1992,
newly graduated specialists have been drifting away from areas
where HMOs are prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure those politicians would feel differently if they had
somebody in their families who's affected by a life-threatening
disease,'' Gerding said. ``But until they do, they just don't get
it.''

 &HT;    CEO builds hotel franchiser into major player
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mike Leven used to be unhappy during the day but slept
like a baby at night.
</P>
<P>
   That was when he was the No. 2 person at Holiday Inn Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Today that's changed. As president of one of the nation's
fastest-growing hotel companies, Leven is much happier during the
day but often has restless nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that no matter what I did, the company would survive
and go on. I was just a cog in the wheel,'' said Leven, who left
Holiday Inn in 1995 to co-found Atlanta-based US Franchise Systems,
a hotel franchise company. ``(Now) I'm personally responsible for
every person here. At the end of the day, you can't walk away from
this.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Leven, USFS president and chief executive officer,
sometimes wakes up in the early morning hours musing over such
things as whether earnings will meet analysts' expectations or how
hotels are performing. His company has emerged from its first two
years of red ink and is rapidly expanding, with more than 1,006
properties open or in development.
</P>
<P>
   The company was recently ranked 10th among the nation's largest
hotel franchise companies with its Microtel Inn &AMP; Suites, Hawthorn
Suites and Best Inns &AMP; Suites brands. Revenue has more than doubled
since 1997, to $10.6 million in 1998. US Franchise went public at
$13.50 a share in October 1996 and reached a 52-week high of $23.25
last month. The company reported its first profit in the third
quarter of 1998, a quarter ahead of projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ramping up the profit curve very rapidly,'' said John
Rohs, an analyst with Schroder Securities in New York.
Additionally, ``small-growth companies have come back into style.
They're no longer the scourge of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Accidental hotel executive
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old, silver-haired Leven is credited with much of
the company's success. Described as gregarious, witty and sometimes
``emotional,'' Leven has a laid-back style around the office. Most
employees refer to him by his first name, and he often forgoes a
tie. Two of his three sons work for the company.
</P>
<P>
   To get some idea of the atmosphere around USFS, visitors need go
no farther than the front office. There, in a waist-high cage, sits
Repete, a snow-white, 20-pound rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Not your usual office furnishing, Repete was once used in an
advertising campaign when the company touted that it was
``rabbitly'' expanding and was an example of ``procreation at its
finest.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's another side to Leven. In his second-floor office in
13 Corporate Square off Buford Highway, one wall is heavily
decorated with golf memorabilia and plaques. Opposite his desk is
his ``philosophy wall,'' which includes a Norman Rockwell poster
depicting diverse people of the world. One of his prized
possessions is a framed selection of notes Leven once wrote to
employees when he was an executive at Days Inn. Examples include:
``I am very alarmed,'' ``Great way to lose a bonus'' and ``Please
change immediately and advise the customer, `Sorry, we're stupid.'
''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of Mike's stronger suits is clearly his sales
ability,'' said Mark Woodworth, a vice president at PKF Consulting
in Atlanta. ``My take is that he has always been very good at
understanding what people want and delivering the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Leven grew up in Boston's Mattapan section. He was an only
child, the son of a traveling salesman for a retail paint and
hardware company. His mother was a secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't poor, but everything that came in went out,''
recalled Leven. Early on, he was encouraged to be a lawyer, and he
imagined himself as the next Clarence Darrow. After graduating from
Tufts University, he was awarded a scholarship to the University of
Chicago's law school, but he left after one semester ``unhappy,
lonely and disappointing my parents and grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   He enrolled in Boston University, where he earned a degree in
public relations and communications. Unable to land a job, he
became a social worker. By then he was engaged to Andrea Aronson,
and social work just didn't bring in enough money for a young
family. Thus began his career in the lodging industry. Leven heard
about a sales job at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York for $98 a
week. At the time, Leven had stayed in a hotel only once in his
life and had never eaten in a hotel restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at myself as a businessman by default,'' said Leven.
``Still today, I don't think of myself as a great business guy. I
think I'm OK. I don't think I'm really tough enough, although I'm
pleased with what I have accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he took positions of increasing responsibility at Sonesta
Hotels and Dunfey Family Hotels. He made his greatest marks at Days
Inn of America and Holiday Inn Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   He served as president of then Atlanta-based Days Inn from 1985
to 1990, leading the company through a reorganization that resulted
in its growth from a 225-unit regional chain into more than 1,000
hotels open and 400 more under franchise agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He also made a mark by initiating special efforts to hire older
workers, people with disabilities and the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   It was while he was at Days Inn that he started a diversity
program to attract Asian-American franchisees. In fact, Leven
wanted to know so much about the culture that he took his family to
India. He was instrumental in the formation of the Asian-American
Hotel Owners Association.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Days Inn, Leven joined another hotel giant,
Holiday Inn Worldwide, which had been acquired by British-based
Bass PLC and later became Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts. There he was
instrumental in the launch and growth of Holiday Inn Express, now
an industry success story. During his five-year reign, the new
brand grew to 330 properties, with a backlog of nearly 500 more.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Leven found it difficult to work for his
new overseas employers. ``I was close enough to the top to see how
things worked,'' he said. ``I have a lot more empathy for the
Founding Fathers of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming an entrepreneur
</P>
<P>
   He decided to leave the company in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that in a big company, there's a tendency to
dehumanize the business,'' he said. ``Companies that are larger
lose their souls to become totally numbers-driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Leven was pondering his next move when his nephew, Neal Aronson,
then a principal at the New York investment firm Odyssey Partners
suggested that he strike out on his own. The idea was heartily
backed by a longtime friend and golf partner, Home Depot co-founder
and Chairman Bernie Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Like Marcus, Leven is very active in community organizations. He
has worked with the Atlanta Jewish Federation and is a trustee of
the American Jewish Committee's Atlanta Chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Leven took the chance, and although he has stumbled at times, he
has never taken a fall. In 1995, he and Aronson formed USFS after
raising $17 million. They bought the exclusive worldwide
franchising rights to the Microtel chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of potential for new construction within the
economy-limited service segment of the lodging industry,'' said
PKF's Woodworth. While there were budget hotels that targeted the
same market, many were in poor condition and very old. The
company's new Microtel brand appealed to travelers on a budget.
Leven calls them ``the Wal-Mart customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, franchise owners of hotels _ his primary customers
_ liked the idea that every Microtel would be in a new building and
would be held to high maintenance standards. Uniform quality
standards are one of the most important factors in franchise
success.
</P>
<P>
   More expansion was on the way. In early 1996, USFS leased the
franchise rights to Hawthorn Suites, an extended-stay hotel chain.
It would later acquire full ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The first big test for the company came in October 1996 when
Leven and Aronson took the company public in an IPO of 2.3 million
shares at $13.50 a share, raising $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the company acquired the exclusive worldwide franchising
rights to Best Inns &AMP; Suites, a midlevel economy brand. A second
public offering followed, raising $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last year or so they have been able to build up a real
head of steam,'' said Schroder Securities' Rohs, who notes that
many hotel stocks have been out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   Leven is still focused on expanding the business. The company
recently announced agreements to build hotels in Honduras and
several other Latin American countries. Over the next few years,
Leven hopes to add 200 properties annually for all three brands.
More acquisitions may also be on the horizon, which would
``accelerate earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   While hotels remain his priority, Leven said the company might
consider branching into other businesses that typically do well at
franchising, such as restaurants and car rental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The company is moving so quickly, Leven may find it hard to
concentrate on four other additions to his family _ his
grandchildren. A set of triplets and a granddaughter were all born
within the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to develop a company with $100 million of
free-and-clear cash flow and a billion in value,'' he said. ``And,
if I'm not too old, I may go for the second billion.

SPORTS COLUMN: IS CLEMENS NOW OVERANALYZING CLEMENS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees keep waiting for Roger Clemens to be the
real Roger Clemens _ the five-time Cy Young Award winner, the
American League's dominant pitcher, the barrel-chested right-hander
whose 20 strikeouts in a game share the major league record with
the Cubs' Kerry Wood, now recuperating from arm surgery. But it's
as if a stranger is impersonating Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   In 17 starts, his won-lost record is a deceptive 9-4 and his
earned run average is a shaky 4.90. If it were at that altitude at
the end of the season, it would be the highest in his 16 years in
the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   At his best, he often had three times as many strikeouts as
bases on balls (271 to 88 a year ago with Toronto, for example) but
this season his ratio is much weaker: only 97 strikeouts to 51
walks. He has invariably allowed fewer hits than innings worked
(only 169 hits in 234 2/3 innings a year ago), but this season his
ratio is wobbly: 113 hits in 101 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll keep grinding,'' he was saying now in the Yankee
clubhouse. ``If it came easy, it wouldn't be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of Clemens' career with the Red Sox and the Blue Jays,
it always came easy, or he made it look easy. Before this season,
his 3,153 strikeouts ranked ninth on the career list, his 93 games
with 10 or more strikeouts were fourth, his six ERA titles were
second, his 233 victories were the most of any active pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe all that success is why, as he awaits Sunday's start
against the Indians at Yankee Stadium, he might be thinking too
much about his struggle to be the real Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see not so much analysis between games, analysis
by himself,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankee manager. ``He's trying so
hard to direct everything _ where this pitch has to go, where that
pitch has to go. He busts himself up. Just let it fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Paralysis by analysis. It can happen to any athlete in any sport
when too much thinking is involved. With a pitcher, it can lead to
his aiming the ball instead of just letting it fly, of letting the
batter worry about it instead of the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all that analysis,'' Torre was quick to add, ``is what
made Roger so good. And there's a big pride factor.''
</P>
<P>
   That pride is why Clemens, understandably, would want to show
the Yankees why he has been the power pitcher of the '90s, why he
was worth being acquired in a trade for David Wells, the Yankees'
best pitcher a year ago in their winning 125 games and the World
Series, why he is expected to help them win another World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the tradition here,'' he said. ``I'm constantly
reminded of it, like the Yogi Berra Day last Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens doesn't buy Torre's big-pride theory that he's
trying too hard to justify his $8.1 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to prove myself,'' he said. ``I pretty much had
my way the last two years in Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   In his two Cy Young Award seasons with the Blue Jays, Clemens
was 21-7 and 2.05 ERA in 1997, 20-6 and 2.65 last year. But even
though the radar guns still clock his fastball in the low 90s,
he'll be 37 on Aug. 4. Maybe this is just the beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   He's got to prove that he hasn't reverted to his mediocre
numbers over his last four seasons with the Red Sox: an overall
40-39 with an overall 3.75 ERA, including a 10-13 record with a
3.63 ERA before bidding Boston adieu for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   In two of those last four Red Sox seasons he was on the disabled
list, in 1995 with a strained muscle behind his right shoulder, in
1993 with a strained groin muscle and a sore pitching elbow. And
maybe a damaged left hamstring contributed to his struggle this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hammy took a little longer to heal,'' he acknowledged,
``because I pitched with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe Clemens' pitching with a damaged hamstring proves
Torre's big-pride theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coney has that same big pride,'' Torre said, referring to the
right-hander David Cone, ``but he's understated about it. He's also
done it in more big games, playoff games, World Series games. And
he had to learn to do it without his fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone also learned to do it under the New York microscope at an
early age, notably with his 20-3 record in his second of six
seasons with the Mets before moving on to Kansas City, to Toronto
and eventually to the Yankees late in the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you can make it here,'' Joe Torre said, smiling, ``you
can make it anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his 9-4 won-lost record, Roger Clemens hasn't yet made
it in New York, but maybe he will if he stops analyzing why he
hasn't.

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ The fate of South America's
longest-running, if turbulent, democracy hangs in the balance in
the vote on Sunday to select delegates to write a new constitution
_ the 27th in Venezuela's history, although the first since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be the only point on which President Hugo Chavez
and his opponents agree.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez maintains that only a new charter will enable him to
carry out the ``peaceful social revolution'' he promised in his
successful presidential campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   His critics contend that the election of the 131 members of the
National Constituent Assembly is their last chance to prevent
Venezuela, the largest foreign supplier of oil to the United States
in recent years, from slipping into what they see as a coming
one-man dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, this is a laudable initiative, an effort to get
representatives of the people together to discuss where we have
failed and to rethink who we are,'' said Jorge Olavarria, a lawyer
and historian who was an early political adviser to Chavez but who
has now broken with the president and is running for an assembly
seat on an anti-Chavez slate. ``But in reality, it is a plan for
Chavez to carry out a coup under legal cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes that Chavez, a 45-year-old former army colonel
who organized an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992, wants enshrined
in a new constitution is the right to succeed himself in office.
When sworn in early in February, he contemptuously described the
current 1961 constitution as ``moribund,'' and on repeated
occasions he has acted as if the charter had already been revoked
and his own powers expanded.
</P>
<P>
   This month, for instance, Chavez promoted 34 military officers
who had been part of his 1992 uprising, defying a warning by the
Senate that his action was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   He has also made Gen. Lucas Rincon his chief of staff, a move
that opposition leaders said also violates a law prohibiting active
duty soldiers from holding such posts.
</P>
<P>
   And he tried to put military officers in charge of the police,
provoking threats of resignations there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is mine,'' Chavez said in brushing aside the
disapproval of the Senate, whose powers of advice and consent are
even more extensive than those of its American counterpart. ``I am
commander in chief of the armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chavez has bypassed government ministries and put
some 70,000 soldiers to work on huge public works projects,
building schools and hospitals, providing free medical services and
selling food to the poor below market cost. Beginning in September,
the government also intends to send soldiers into the schools to
teach military doctrine to students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez's ultimate goal is to remain in power, converting the
traditional political class into a scapegoat and making the armed
forces his political party,'' said Anibal Romero, author of
``Security, Defense and Democracy in Venezuela,'' and other books.
``Some of the things he is doing, such as his flirtation with Fidel
Castro, bother them, but they like the fact that he is
incorporating them into his government and giving them civilian
posts.''
</P>
<P>
   The election, which will take Venezuelans to the polls for the
fourth time in less than a year, is nominally nonpartisan. But the
campaign has turned into a bare-knuckles display of political
brinkmanship, with Chavez, who enjoys an 80 percent approval rating
in the latest polls, inevitably at the center of the fray.
</P>
<P>
   When the National Electoral Council, for instance, ruled that
Chavez could not actively campaign for candidates from his own
party, he was defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to take me to jail, let them come for me,'' he
said. ``Here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the same body recently barred his weekly radio and
television shows until after the vote, his response was to comply
with the letter of the verdict, though not the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   He sent aides to substitute for him at the radio program last
Sunday and then called in as a guest. The president then
circumvented the ban on his television show by using his powers as
head of state to convoke a national network for a speech that all
stations were obliged to carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can bind me with 1,000 chains, but Hugo Chavez will keep
on talking,'' he said during the telephone call to the radio
program. Fined the equivalent of $7,700 by the tribunal because of
the violations, Chavez has set up stands on the street to collect
donations from supporters to pay the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must help Chavez root out the corruption that is eating
away at this country,'' Pedro Rafael Hernandez Ochoa, a supporter
of the president, said Thursday night at a ceremony at which money
was delivered to Chavez at the Presidential Palace to pay the fine.
``The rotten political elite is blocking his way, and only with a
new Magna Carta can he make the changes we need to make Venezuela a
true democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbidden by law from being a candidate himself, Chavez has
urged his wife, Marisabel, a radio broadcaster with no previous
political experience, to run as his standard-bearer. In addition,
five members of his Cabinet resigned to run for assembly seats,
joining former President Carlos Andres Perez, against whom the 1992
coup was directed, and lawyers, economists, athletes, journalists
and even an astrologer among the 1,059 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The president is also facing an investigation into whether he
has misused state funds to promote his candidates. He has described
that effort as part of a politically motivated conspiracy to weaken
his fight ``against the tyranny of corruption and the elites that
destroyed this country.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Eduardo Roche, the nation's comptroller general, retorted: ``The
president can be certain that insults and falsehoods do not
frighten me. He must understand that this office will never be
subservient.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the passions aroused by the issues, and the country's
turbulent history of military strongmen and coups before the 1961
constitution, the campaign his been generally peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, though, four people in white hoods interrupted a
university forum featuring Alberto Franceschi, an outspoken
opposition leader who is expected to be the principal anti-Chavez
spokesman in the assembly, and detonated a series of bombs.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the incident, which emptied the
auditorium. But Franceschi described the episode as ``a humiliating
display of Chavez-style democracy,'' intended to ``silence the
voice of the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   There are persistent reports that Chavez's ruling coalition, the
Patriotic Pole, has agreed that the top vote-getter will be made
president of the assembly, with powers to control the agenda and
pace of work.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview last week, Mrs. Chavez, who polls
indicate may win that distinction, said she was unaware of such an
arrangement, but added, ``I feel prepared and would accept the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the result, further conflict is expected. Despite
rulings by the Supreme Court to the contrary, Chavez has said the
assembly will have the power to dissolve Congress and the courts
and assume their powers until a new charter is approved, indicating
on several occasions that he wants it to do precisely that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constituent Assembly is going to be the moment of truth
for Chavez,'' said Anibal Romero, who is a professor of political
science at Simon Bolivar University here. ``It is going to force
him to define a path, and I believe that path is going to be one of
military populism and anti-imperialism.''

ARMSTRONG WINS TIME TRIAL AND LOOKS FOR INSPIRATIONAL VICTORY

   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ Good thing Lance Armstrong didn't put his
money where his mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a betting man,'' he said before the Tour de France's
19th of 20 daily stages Saturday, a long time trial, ``I'd put my
money on Zuelle. He needs to beat Escartin.''
</P>
<P>
   The race leader referred to the two men immediately behind him,
Alex Zuelle, a Swiss with the Banesto racing team who was in third
place, and Fernando Escartin, a Spaniard with Kelme who was in
second.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's reasoning was sound and even accurate up to a point.
Zuelle did easily beat Escartin, making up a gap of 1 minute 13
seconds, and move up to second a day before the Tour ends in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong beat Zuelle and everybody else, registering his
fourth stage victory and the third in three time trials, which are
solitary races against the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The first was in the prologue July 3, just 4 miles, which he won
by 7 seconds over the second-placed Zuelle. The second was a
35-mile ride around Metz on July 11, which he won by 58 seconds
over the second-placed Zuelle.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 35 miles Saturday, he won by nine seconds over _ who
else? _ the second-placed Zuelle. Armstrong's teammate Tyler
Hamilton was third, 1:35 behind the winner in a gutsy showing by a
rider who gave his all for his U.S. Postal Service team leader in
the Alps and Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted this victory,'' Armstrong said later Saturday.
``I didn't start with the same fire I had in Metz but I wanted to
show the yellow jersey today.''
</P>
<P>
   He showed the emblem of leadership to vast crowds that stood in
the sun and a strong wind in and around Futuroscope, a theme park
devoted to technology. Armstrong rode like a machine himself,
finishing in 1 hour 8 minutes 17 seconds, a speed of 31 mph _ the
legal top speed for a car _ despite the wind.
</P>
<P>
   That performance increased his overall lead to 7:37 over Zuelle
and 10:26 over Escartin, now in third place. Hamilton jumped three
notches to 13th over all.
</P>
<P>
   Beforehand, relaxed and excited at the same time, Armstrong
lounged in a team trailer and talked about everything that came to
mind _ except for the fact that Sunday he will win the Tour de
France. Until the moment that he pulls the final yellow jersey of
the winner over his head, he refuses to refer to more than ``my
potential victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even the prospect of hundreds of fans who are coming from
back home in Texas to cheer him in Paris could budge Armstrong from
his refusal to claim victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will be surprised at all the people there on the
Champs-Elysees that at the last minute jumped on a plane to Paris
from Texas,'' he said. ``Neighbors, friends. To ride the Tour is
one thing, to ride well is another, to potentially win is another,
but to be there on the Champs-Elysees with family and friends and
neighbors, that's fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' he continued in an interview Friday night.
``I'm ready to get this over with, I'm ready to celebrate with
family and friends, I'm ready to have a good time. I've lived like
a monk for six months,'' since the racing season began.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his white team T-shirt and blue sweat pants, Armstrong looked
remarkably fresh for somebody who was on the verge of completing a
three-week, 2,290-mile trek, often through rain, sometimes through
heavy heat.
</P>
<P>
   If he looks rested, though, he isn't. ``I don't feel fresh,'' he
said. ``I started to feel really tired after Piau-Engaly,'' the
first stage in the Pyrenees last Tuesday. ``That was two weeks into
the race, a rough period for anybody. It was a very hot day and I
had the stress after the race of more doping innuendos and I'd worn
the jersey for a week _ all that was hard for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to reports in the French press that an illegal
substance had been detected in his body after a urinalysis. The
charge surfaced after he won the Tour's prologue on July 3, was
revived after he won the first Alpine stage on July 13 and then
flowered in the Pyrenees, where he again rode strongly.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong then said that he had used a cortisone-based salve to
treat a skin rash and had produced a medical certificate to justify
its use, although he admitted that he had made ``a mistake'' not to
make this public earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Armstrong said some people refused to believe
that he could be fit enough to win the demanding Tour de France 2
and a half years after he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that
had spread to his lungs and brain. Three months of what he
describes as ``very toxic chemotherapy'' checked the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are journalists in France and there are doctors on
French teams who think I've been given something special by my
oncologist,'' he said. ``They think I was given drugs that boost
performance. It's the exact opposite: I was given things that can
kill you.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of talk, it makes me sick. But when the race is
over, that stuff doesn't live. The victory and the people that I
touch and the story that I can tell _ that lives.''
</P>
<P>
   His story is extremely important to him as an example to other
victims of cancer and their families, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to be a cancer survivor and I'm proud to do this, I
really am,'' he said. ``This race and my performance here are going
to affect a lot of people in a positive way, in a wonderful,
fantastic way. I think I've told my story. That's what I always
wanted to do. I've shared my story with the world.'' &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The air will become noticeably drier Sunday across the Northeast
as slightly cooler air arrives on breezes from the northwest. Low
pressure near Montreal will steer a cold front off the New England
coast by mid-afternoon. Showers and a few thunderstorms will dampen
the interior Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   As winds begin to blow from the northwest in the Middle Atlantic
region, the humidity will drop, the haze will lift, but the air
will remain quite hot. Readings will reach between 95 and 100
degrees in parts of Virginia and the eastern Carolinas. Isolated
thunder is expected along the shore and in the southern
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Along the perimeter of very sultry air, strong thunderstorms
will develop from the Carolina coast across the Deep South and into
eastern Texas. There will be a concentration of storms at the Gulf
Coast due to active sea breezes.
</P>
<P>
   Small high pressure located near Chicago will sponsor sunshine
and rather hot but moderately humid air in the Middle West and Ohio
Valley. A torrid flow from the south will interact with an
approaching front to trigger a cluster of heavy thunderstorms in
eastern South Dakota. Moisture from the Southwest monsoon will
initiate more afternoon storms from southern Arizona to central
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasantly cool air will spread from the Pacific Northwest into
the northern Rockies. Clouds will dominate west of the Cascades in
Washington. Developing offshore breezes in northern California will
bring sunny skies to the Coast. The Southwest will be hot and a bit
more humid in the deserts.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: PAST THE PEAK
</P>
<P>
   The maximum average daily temperature for the year in New York,
78 degrees, occurs Sunday and Monday. Interestingly, this does not
coincide with the maximum amount of daylight, which was on June 21,
the first day of summer. The lag exists for two reasons. First, the
sun's energy takes a long time to completely remove winter's chill
throughout the atmosphere. Second, the oceans also take a long time
to warm, thus, any wind blowing off the water cools the coast until
the waters become warm. After Monday, the average temperature will
start its steady drop to winter's lowest point in January.

 &HT;    Symbolic politics: Giuliani set to visit Clinton hometown
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a lunch in Little Rock, Ark., where the best
stuff being served up doesn't appear on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   When New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani sits down Tuesday with
big-name locals at a $500-a-head fund-raiser at the Capital Hotel,
it will be political chutzpah not rubber chicken that will be the
real bill of fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's more symbolic than anything,'' said Steven
Neuse, head of the University of Arkansas' political science
department.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you hadn't already heard about Giuliani's Southern swing
_ after Arkansas, he heads Wednesday to Alabama for three private
fund-raisers _ nearly everyone knows that he's the presumed likely
Republican candidate in the 2000 U.S. Senate race in New York. His
presumed Democratic opponent? First lady and former Little Rock
resident Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   By now, too, most Arkansans have figured out the real reason for
this brief visit by the tough-talking man known simply as ``Rudy''
to most New Yorkers. The election may be 16 months off, the
electorate 1,500 miles away. The $30,000 to $35,000 expected to be
raised by Tuesday's lunch may barely buy a steak dinner in
Giuliani's Manhattan, let alone significantly affect campaign
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's never too early to pound away at the ``Hillary as
carpetbagger'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hilarious!'' Travis Lawrence, 29, the manager of New
York Air Brake Co. in Little Rock, said when told about Giuliani's
impending visit. ``It's kind of rubbing it in her face by coming to
her hometown. It's kind of like he's saying `I ain't got no
business being here' and `You ain't got no business being there'!''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Giuliani's Southern sojourn has nothing to do with
rubbing anybody's face in anything, and everything to do with
allies' mutual backslapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primarily, the reason for the trip is to do the fund-raisers
and, obviously, to meet with business and political leaders in
Arkansas and Alabama,'' said Bruce Teitelbaum, executive director
of the mayor's Senate exploratory committee. ``People who've heard
about what he's done with New York (City), who think he's done a
great job there and think he'd do a great job in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the chairman of the Alabama GOP had hoped to lure
Giuliani there for a party fund-raiser in the fall, but says a
private citizen ``jumped ahead of us'' by organizing Wednesday's
events in Huntsville, Birmingham and Tuscaloosa, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   All this fuss over a pro-choice Yankee?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people see Giuliani as a very successful big city
mayor,'' said Alabama party Chairman Winton Blount, adding that
only out-of-town business is keeping him from Wednesday's
fund-raisers. ``You only have to go to New York to not only listen
to New Yorkers talk about it, but to sense it and feel it and see
it. So I think he'll do OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1,000-per-couple Alabama events should raise ``over six
figures,'' Teitelbaum said. Still, there's no free lunch, as the
mayor may discover in Little Rock, where he'll meet first with his
luncheon co-sponsors and fellow Republicans, Gov. Mike Huckabee and
Lt. Gov. Winthrop P. Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance to show off Arkansas to the mayor of the
nation's largest city,'' Huckabee spokesman Rex Nelson practically
crowed, adding that the group might also check out the Old
Statehouse's museum.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems odd to think of Rudy even temporarily transplanted
from his normal milieu of crowded subways, cranky reporters and
careening bike messengers, Blount says it's just politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money doesn't have any state borders,'' said Blount, whose
organization recently sent out a fund-raising letter proclaiming
``We must rid ourselves of the Clintons'' and invoking the first
lady's possible candidacy. ``The Clinton Administration will be
raising money from Hollywood and all the places that they raise
money from.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's just politics as usual in this highly unusual
race. The first book deal has already been signed to cover the
Clinton-Giuliani race _ and neither has officially entered yet.
Meanwhile, Giuliani could face a bloody primary battle against a
candidate backed by arch-enemy New York Republican Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder, then, that Rudy might welcome this brief
respite in the kinder, gentler South? Or that Arkansans might be of
mixed-emotions about this whole slightly surreal situation?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `Oh, Hillary will be sensitive to us, it will
be like having a third senator from Arkansas','' said Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette columnist John Brummett, adding that others see
Giuliani as a ``mean-spirited'' former federal prosecutor who'll
open up all the old Clinton wounds for a huge press corps. ``You
hear `Oh my God, it's going to another case of international focus
on Arkansas-bashing'.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, the air brake company manager, was more succinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just as backwards as it can be.

President Clinton, merits attention for several reasons. First, the
region is the United States' sixth-largest export market. Second,
the measure would eliminate tariffs on a variety of items including
clothes and watches, meaning the prices for those items in U.S.
stores should go down. And the measure could boost economies in the
Caribbean, which would hopefully stem immigration that has
skyrocketed since last year's hurricanes. We look at the impact of
CBI on the average Joe, and in particular on states such as

especially the brash Vicente Fox of Mexico's conservative

education will be on the top of the list. Texas is being touted as
a shining example of improvement, no small feat in the country's
second largest state, which used to rank near the bottom in most
academic indicators. Bush has made education a top priority, from
ending social promotion to increasing accountability and testing to
increasing state funding of public schools. But he's been unable to
deliver on vouchers, and some critics say he cannot take credit for
the recent rise. The seeds of Texas' success were sown in the
mid-1980s, with laws to create smaller classes, give more money to
poor school districts and increase academic standards. (Brooks,

whose children have asthma, and United has helped a young man with
diabetes. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News)

 COMMENTARY: THE SILENT TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The anger in the neighborhoods is not being heard.
There was a flurry of well-publicized protests after the Diallo
shooting but that's over. The cops continue to do what they want,
much of it lousy. The mayor says we're not as bad as some places,
which is a comfort, I guess. A man who beats his wife is not as bad
as one who kills her.
</P>
<P>
   This time the black person hauled away and degraded by police
for no good reason was Alton Fitzgerald White, a star of the
Broadway hit ``Ragtime.'' White, who is 35, was standing in the
vestibule of his apartment building in upper Manhattan when police
arrived. He opened the door to hold it for them, thinking they were
there to help someone in distress. As he's always been a
law-abiding individual, he never imagined they would arrest him and
drag him away like so much garbage.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what they did. It seems a couple of Hispanic guys in
the building's lobby had some cocaine. And that's reason enough in
the cowboy logic of the police to arrest any black men who are
nearby. In this case there were three of them. One was White.
</P>
<P>
   I asked a spokeswoman for Police Commissioner Howard Safir if it
made sense to arrest everyone in the lobby before police really
knew what was going on. She said: ``Yes. Until you sort it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the naive think you actually have to be involved in a crime
before the police bust you in New York. Or shoot you. White tried
to explain that he had done nothing wrong, that he lived in the
building. Neighbors tried to tell the officers they were making a
mistake, that White was a straight arrow, a good and talented man,
an actor in a starring role on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   To the cops he was a ``male black,'' and thus a perpetual
suspect. Nothing more. There are no heights he can climb that will
raise him above suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being on stage when the curtain went up for the
evening performance of ``Ragtime'' on July 16, White was caged like
an animal at the 33rd Precinct station house on Amsterdam Avenue.
He told The Times' Dinitia Smith that he found himself weeping from
the humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Later the cops would apologize. White was innocent after all. So
were the other black men who were arrested. A kilo of cocaine was
seized in the lobby, but White had nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   It was unfortunate that he was strip-searched and traumatized,
and that he missed several performances. But, hey, it was an honest
mistake. It's not like what happened to Abner Louima, or Amadou
Diallo. If you think about it, White should consider himself lucky.
After all, he wasn't brutalized. He's still in one piece. He's
still alive. And it certainly was reasonable to arrest him. After
all, even he admits he's black.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his top police officials apparently
do not realize _ or do not care _ that the department's relentless
and indiscriminate attack on New Yorkers who are not white is both
wrong and dangerous. People in black and Latino neighborhoods are
being stopped and searched by the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Rice High School, the only Catholic high school in
Harlem, told The Times in March that one of their teachers, Brother
Tyrone Davis, had become reluctant to leave work without his
religious collar because he had grown so tired of being stopped by
police. Students at Rice High who are engaged in no wrongdoing are
frequently stopped and frisked.
</P>
<P>
   Why this is not a larger news story I don't know. An enormous
segment of the city's population is being subjected to routine
humiliation by police. But unless a cop takes a cylinder and shoves
it deep into someone's rectum, or unloads an insane volley of
bullets into an innocent man, it is not considered a big story.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if the reporters and editors and television news
directors in this town were unable to grasp the significance of
what police are doing. And perhaps that is because so many in the
media are as guilty as the police of promoting stereotypes and
denying the humanity of certain people.
</P>
<P>
   Damarr McBean, a 15-year-old honors student at Rice High, said
of his encounters with police: ``It just makes you feel low, like
you don't stand for anything. You just feel violated.''

<P>
   MAGADAN, Russia _ On the outskirts of town, a former Stalinist
prison stands behind a row of concrete slabs. Undaunted by warnings
from local residents who wish to remember Stalin's horrors but are
acutely aware that this is still state property, the
Chinese-American guest scrambled up the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The guest, Harry Wu, a former Chinese dissident, spent 19 years
in Maoist prisons that were modeled on the Soviet gulag system and
set up with the help of Russians. Now that he was visiting the
Russian city that was once the center of a sprawling archipelago of
sub-Arctic prison camps, he wanted a better look.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go in there,'' cried Miron Etlis, a former prisoner
who was guiding Wu on a trip to a nearby monument to Stalin's
victims. ``That's military property.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu, 61, jumped off the wall into the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Wu is a research fellow at the Hoover Institute at Stanford
University and is active on behalf of Chinese political prisoners.
He visited Magadan, a city of 134,000, as it was commemorating the
60th anniversary of its incorporation at the height of Stalin's
purges and seven years after the Kolyma labor camps opened here.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary came complete with oompah bands in the square
and cheerful drunks lurching down Lenin Prospect in the midnight
sun, apparently heedless of the tens of thousands of former
prisoners buried in the tundra around here _ some of the 2 million
or so who mined gold, silver, tin and uranium in the Magadan and
nearby Chukotka regions from 1932 to 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Hu flew in at his own expense to speak to a crowd of just 15 at
a historical conference held as part of the 60th anniversary
events. He has repeatedly returned to China to document prison
labor and the harvesting of organs from executed inmates, and said
he wanted to urge Russians both to treasure their nascent democracy
and the memory of Soviet repression.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remove all the Lenin and Stalin statues and put up
gulag monuments,'' Wu said at one point, jabbing his finger at his
hosts. ``That's the only way to keep it from coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Magadan residents, like Russians in general, are ambivalent
about how best to commemorate the legacy of state terror. On a hill
outside town, a monument to gulag victims looms like a giant head
from Easter Island.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a street and a school are named for Edward Berzin, the
director of Dalstroi, the state company that built the camps and
ran the mining enterprises, and his muscular bust stands on a
pedestal in front of city hall. Because he was purged in 1937,
officials have recast him as a gulag victim.
</P>
<P>
   Lyudmila Vronchina, a city librarian who helps former inmates
garner the documents necessary to apply for federal aid for
ex-prisoners, said the Berzin monument ``sends chills down my
spine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a murderer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Biryukov, a Magadan lawyer whose father was a camp
prisoner, has compiled a list of every one of the 11,000 people
documented to have been shot in Kolyma camps by the state security
organ, the N.K.V.D.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of others died from disease, cold and
overwork. Biryukov has also begun researching the location of
graves and said some bodies were still partly preserved in the
permafrost.
</P>
<P>
   Wu had another idea: using the old prison as a gulag museum. The
property is now owned by the Russian military but partly occupied
by a scrap metal dealership.
</P>
<P>
   After jumping from the wall, Wu charged into the old prison,
yanking open doors and testing locks, trying to calculate how many
prisoners occupied each cell.
</P>
<P>
   The cells, whose walls have been knocked down, measured about 10
feet by 11 feet and were unlighted and unheated. Prisoners
sometimes froze to death overnight. Surviving prisoners would stack
the dead in the corner and eat their bread rations until the guards
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So each cell was designed for 20 people,'' said Wu, pacing
about. Etlis, 71, who had found his way in through a gate, arrived
to hear this. ``Ha! I was in a cell like this in Kazakhstan and
there were 50 people,'' he said. Wu eventually concluded that up to
3,500 prisoners had been crammed into the building.
</P>
<P>
   After Wu had filmed every corner, the group filed out. But he
hung back, apparently pondering the prison's history, then beckoned
to a reporter and pointed out a 1930s-era padlock bolted to a jail
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get it off,'' Wu said. ``I want it.'' After efforts to pick it
with a pen failed, he said: ``Just break it. Break it with your
hands.'' The lock held. Disappointed, Wu walked out. Just such a
lock had hung on his own Chinese prison door.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, ``was the lock produced by Lenin.''

 &HT;    HMO's rejection stiffens crusader's resolve
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It wasn't just United HealthCare's refusal to pay
a $555 medical bill that turned Jane Boucher Arntz into a crusader
for patients' rights. What really got under her skin was her
impression that United seemed bent on doing whatever it took to
avoid paying that bill.
</P>
<P>
   She has letters from United that gave her the wrong phone number
for appealing the coverage denial and contradicted themselves in
explaining it. She has the sour aftertaste of what she called rude
customer-service representatives who seemed annoyed at being
bothered with her contention that stabbing abdominal pain
constituted an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we gotten so inhuman that it's all about money and,
`Don't care about healing people?''' Arntz asked. ``The group of
people I met were so cold: 'Forget her pain. We're fighting about
$500 here.' You get the feeling these people never had anyone in
their families who were sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Arntz' secondary insurer paid the claim without a quibble, but
the experience ``completely changed'' the focus of her career as a
national public speaker and president of Boucher Consultants.
</P>
<P>
   She has conferred with the staff of Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah),
who sits on the subcommittee that oversees health insurance. He
shared her concern about the health care system's ``lack of
compassion'' and failure to cover certain medical services, so she
was disappointed when he voted with Senate Republicans against the
right to sue an HMO this month.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people unhappy about patient protections left out of
the Senate bill, Arntz said her health plan's callousness was at
least as upsetting as its stinginess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked with countless people who feel helpless, depressed
and resigned because they do not know how to make the system
respond to their needs as it ought to,'' she said, including some
doctors and hospitals other than HMOs. ``I want to contribute to
the kind of health-care reform where the patient comes first.''
</P>
<P>
   Arntz, now 49, was giving a seminar in Asheville, N.C., on Oct.
18, 1996, when she felt a stabbing pain in her abdomen unlike any
she'd had with previously treated endometriosis. She went to a
nearby clinic, which sent her to a lab for diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute would center largely around whether she should have
gone to a different treatment facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``United HealthCare always has the best medical interests of its
members in mind, including making sure the member receives the most
appropriate treatment at the appropriate setting,'' the company
said in a prepared statement, citing its policy against violating
the confidentiality of any specific member.
</P>
<P>
   In a city she didn't know and in pain she couldn't stand, Arntz
said she drove her rental car to the only place she had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of reasons you can have pain in the abdomen,''
she said. ``A tumor. An irritable bowel. I thought I was having an
appendicitis attack or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   She knew United's rules. She called its number for
preauthorization but couldn't get through. She said she learned
later United was having phone problems that day.
</P>
<P>
   All the tests were negative, and the pain eventually subsided.
Her Dayton specialist, to whom United had earlier referred her,
wrote on her behalf that the tests appeared to be a reasonable
response to her complaint, but the claim was denied.
</P>
<P>
   She called the phone number on the denial letter to appeal. In
her next four phone conversations, United representatives told her
she couldn't, could, couldn't and then could have an appeal
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The day after her hearing, United's customer service supervisor
sent Arntz a letter saying the appeal was denied but she could call
a particular number if she had other questions. That number was
wrong, and connected her with a recorded message at NCR.
</P>
<P>
   After several more calls, Arntz reached the customer service
supervisor, who Arntz said was sarcastic and demeaning in refusing
to explain specifics of the denial and couldn't understand why
Arntz was upset about a little typo in the phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not be happy about the committee's decision, but it does
not give (the supervisor) the right to be rude,'' Arntz wrote in a
letter to David Shafer, then United's CEO in the Dayton office. A
vice president wrote back three weeks later apologizing ``for the
apparent confusion and frustration you experienced with our
customer service staff, although I feel it was unintended.''
</P>
<P>
   By appealing to the Ohio Department of Insurance, or ODI, Arntz
was able to learn United based its denial on the clinic's use of
two different dates, evidence that the clinic was not an
urgent-care center, the lack of preauthorization, the
inappropriateness of the tests for her diagnosis of ``acute
abdominal or pelvic pain,'' and United's not learning the situation
was an emergency ``until the hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   United also told ODI that when Arntz explained she was ``forced
to go outside the network,'' it suggested the trip to the clinic in
North Carolina ``was a planned visit.'' And it said her doctor's
reference to Arntz's proactive role in maintaining her health
``does not support the contention that this was an emergency
visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Arntz wants to be a voice for people with similar
experiences who are unable to speak up for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of being sick,'' she said, ``you have to deal with the
psychological fear that they're not going to pay. Then you have to
deal with the stress of fighting something that's much bigger than
you are as an individual. Most people don't have the resources _
financial or emotional _ and they give up. I took it as far as I
could with United and I still lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance is only part of her new mission, Arntz said. She also
is working on a Ph.D. in naturopathy, which emphasizes the body's
natural ability to heal itself, and she wants to speak and write
about the role that well-informed people can play in protecting or
retrieving their own good health. She wants ``to wake people up to
what their options are and even though their situation may look
impossible, to keep on keeping on.''

 &HT;    United HealthCare stresses education
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Chris Anderson was 19 last summer when he came
home not feeling so good. Thin and athletic, he had never really
been sick, but now he kept drinking water and couldn't quench his
thirst.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, he was a diabetic and he was in the
hospital,'' said his mother, Linda.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's HMO, United HealthCare, normally wants patients in
Anderson's condition out of the hospital in 24 to 48 hours, his
mother said. But his blood sugar levels kept fluctuating wildly,
and 48 hours weren't enough for the Mercy Medical Center staff in
Springfield to stabilize those levels and teach him all the ins and
outs a diabetes patient needs to know to keep the disease from
flaring up.
</P>
<P>
   No one from the HMO objected when Anderson stayed in the
hospital more than 72 hours. The next person to contact him from
United was its diabetes coordinator, offering to help however she
could and urging him to make prompt appointments with an eye doctor
and dentist to help avert common diabetic complications.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care was originally set up to reduce costs by decreasing
the need for medical service. Anderson's experience has been a
happy example.
</P>
<P>
   ``United HealthCare encourages all that education because if
diabetics control their blood sugar, they can avoid or delay any of
those horrible complications,'' Linda Anderson said. ``They
actually get it, that if they encourage people to take care of
themselves now, they'll save money in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neat that a health plan gets that, instead of saying,
'Oh, no, we can't pay the $35 it would cost to get that education
class,' even though it might keep you from getting your leg
amputated sometime down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Both United and Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which
dominate the Dayton-area HMO market, have several programs to help
members control various diseases. Besides diabetes, United has
programs for members with asthma and other lung diseases, heart
disease and back problems, along with increased rates of childhood
vaccinations, babies with acceptable birth weights and such
preventive screenings as mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   United has paid for Anderson's glucose monitor insulin pen for
injecting measured cartridges. ``They're convenience things,'' said
his mother, ``but they make it easier for a person to take control
of diabetes.'' Now with his recently approved insulin pump
providing regular doses through a small catheter, Anderson no
longer has to give himself three or four shots a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to change the batteries and the catheters,'' said
Anderson, who lives in Springfield and works in Dayton. ``There's
some things United Health is covering that I'm sure would never
have been covered under regular insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an intricate regimen, keeping close track of everything he
eats, interrupting any exertion to make sure his blood sugar is
stable. All it took last fall was some over-the-counter cold
medicine to throw him out of whack. Who knew some of those drugs
were loaded with sugar?
</P>
<P>
   United hooked Anderson up with diabetes educator Tanya Evans,
who has since moved from Mercy to Children's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I know about diabetes, I learned from her,'' he
said. ``It's nice to know in case something does go wrong, I can
always get a hold of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has had a good attitude about the disease, his mother
said, at least partly because ``they taught him not to be afraid of
it.'' To him, diabetes is just another job he has to do.
</P>
<P>
   He's still active athletically. He runs, works out, water skis.
``Nothing stops him,'' Linda said. Nothing except for the sheer
normalcy he has maintained in a life disrupted so suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   With all the time he spends at work, he said, ``I really don't
have as much time for sports as I used to.''

 &HT;    Cowboy Junkies glad to be on the road; bemused by attempts to
label sound
 &HT;    By Carol Simmons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Canadian-born band happily known as the
Cowboy Junkies makes music that eludes corralling.
</P>
<P>
   You just can't fence in this gang _ consisting of siblings
Michael, Margo and Peter Timmins plus Michael's childhood friend
Alan Anton _ with easy labels. The encyclopedic ``All Music'' guide
on the Web lists the band under the genre of rock, but describes
its style as ``Alternative Pop/Rock, Alternative Country-Rock,
Adult Alternative Pop/Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Which pretty much means you've got to listen for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   It also means a description that may be true for one particular
song or album gets applied over and over again, whether or not it
still holds.
</P>
<P>
   The band's breakthrough album, ``The Trinity Sessions,'' which
was recorded in a Toronto church with a single microphone,
identified the group's sound as haunting, mournful and ethereal.
But that was 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Timmins, the band's chief songwriter, guitarist and
guiding force, says that while he and his bandmates once felt some
frustration when reading or hearing seemingly automatic adjectives
applied to their music, they're mostly amused these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think fans take more offense than we do,'' he said last week
from Santa Fe, N.M., where the band was performing as part of its
``Summer Waltz'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult thing to define music,'' Timmins
acknowledged. ``You get hanged with certain adjectives and they
stick. Sometimes it's just funny. There's nothing you can do to
influence it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the group has such a way with a slow, sad song _
especially given the hypnotic and often languorous (and yes,
ethereal) quality of lead singer Margo Timmins' voice _ it's not
surprising that the Cowboy Junkies often are portrayed as brooding
and even dark.
</P>
<P>
   Michael admits that their music does often touch on the darker
aspects of life, but it's a mood, not necessarily a world view.
Michael said he's most interested in capturing the full experience
life has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Read the band's tour diary, updated almost daily on its recently
launched Web site, www.cowboyjunkies.com, and you soon see that
these are not unhappy people. Reflective and thoughtful, certainly,
but also joyful and adventuresome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you invest real emotion, sing about the true side of
relationships, there will be some dark,'' Timmins said. There's
also a lot of light.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing comes sugar-coated, though. ``There's not a lot of
saccharin in our songs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The main thing is to be real, to tell real stories.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the reason the late singer-songwriter Townes Van
Zandt was such an influence on the band. Despite his personal
demons and shortcomings, Van Zandt told stories that rang with
truth while capturing a pure ``love of songs,'' Timmins said.
</P>
<P>
   In concert, Margo has been known to dedicate their early song
``Misguided Angel'' to Van Zandt, just as folk-rock songstress
Lucinda Williams has been known to dedicate her own ``Drunken
Angel'' to the late songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   The Junkies' summer tour is a two-month jaunt through Canada and
the United States, where the band (which includes backup from
Cincinnati-based Over The Rhine's own Karin Bergquist and Linford
Dettweiler) is primarily playing outdoor venues. Timmins said
they've been very lucky in terms of weather so far, hitting towns
just before or after major heat waves.
</P>
<P>
   Timmins said the tour is partly for the fun of it, and partly to
support the band's recently released album, ``Rarities, B-Sides and
Slow, Sad Waltzes,'' which is available only at the shows and on
the Internet through its official Web site and amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Put out on its own newly revived Latent label, which the band
used to release its debut album, ``Whites Off Earth No!,'' as well
as ``The Trinity Sessions'' collection, ``Rarities'' is an
assortment of songs that were recorded over the years, but never
found a home on any of the band's previous releases.
</P>
<P>
   Resurrecting the label allows the group to pursue side projects
while still recording albums for the Arista label.
</P>
<P>
   Timmins, who produced the 10-song (plus a hidden track)
collection released in May, said the process of putting the album
together was enjoyable on several levels. ``We got to go through a
lot of old tapes we haven't gone through in a long time,'' he said.
The effect was something akin to going through an old photo album,
in that band members had the chance to reflect on the course of
their musical journey, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting to be somewhat embarrassed by early recorded efforts,
``I was pleasantly surprised at how good we sounded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The results are pure Cowboy Junkies, distinctive, yet not easily
defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that all of these songs have in common,''
Timmins writes in the liner note, ``is that they are our stories
told in the best way we know how.''

TO PICK A PRIVATE PILOT, CHECK HOURS LOGGED, RECENT FLYING AND
PERSONALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Each year, about 1 in 100 of the nation's private
planes have an accident, and 1 in 300 have an accident that kills
somebody. How can a traveler considering using something other than
a commercial airline spot the risky flights in advance?
</P>
<P>
   There are no hard-and-fast answers in the complex arena of
general aviation, which includes nearly 200,000 planes, everything
from individuals' private planes to corporate jets and air taxis.
But the questions come up from time to time, especially after a
highly publicized accident like the one that killed John F. Kennedy
Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren G.
Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   Government records show that flying on a major airline last year
was 225 times safer than on a private plane, with 1.35 fatal
accidents per 100,000 flight hours on the so-called general
aviation planes compared with .006 per 100,000 hours on big
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   While statistical comparisons of driving and flying are
imprecise, it appears that driving a car is six or eight times more
dangerous than flying commercially, but hundreds of times safer
than flying in private planes.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with those kind of odds, passengers might want to think
carefully about the plane, its pilot and the conditions in which
they will fly.
</P>
<P>
   Flight instructors, government officials and other experts say
that, as a general rule, whether the pilot has recent experience in
the precise model of plane to be flown can be just as important, or
more so, than the total number of hours the pilot has spent aloft.
</P>
<P>
   The experts also say that passengers might pay attention to the
pilot's physical and mental condition and temperament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tendency is to work all day, and then you go out and
fly,'' said L. Nick Lacey Jr., a senior Federal Aviation
Administration official. ``He's climbing into this machine that
requires tremendous concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   Others add that a critical factor is personality, including the
willingness to delay a trip or turn around and go home if
conditions are deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   A question to ask a pilot is how many hours he or she has
logged. It takes at least 40 hours to get a certificate as a
private pilot, which allows the holder to carry passengers, but not
for pay. In practice, many pilots have 75 or more hours before they
get a private certificate.
</P>
<P>
   (Carrying passengers who pay requires a commercial license,
which takes 250 hours, but many of those pilots have far more.)
</P>
<P>
   Experts differ when asked how much experience is enough. The
average general aviation pilot logs fewer than 100 hours a year;
some people consider a pilot a novice until 500 hours have been
logged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It varies tremendously with the kind of training he gets,''
said a captain at a major airline, who is a former accident
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   A military pilot with 200 hours of intense training could be
landing a jet on an aircraft carrier at night, he said. But after
200 hours in a small Cessna, a civilian would be little more than a
novice.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is how many hours the pilot has logged in the
plane in which the trip will be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a multiengine airplane,'' said Thomas Bradshaw, an
aviation insurance broker at Halpin Hall &AMP; Associates, in Fort
Worth, ``how much time does he have in a multiengine? If it's got
retractable landing gear, how much time does he have in
retractable?''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA does not require training when ``transitioning'' from
one general aviation airplane to another, he said, but some
insurance companies require it before providing insurance.
</P>
<P>
   If a pilot invited him for a first flight on a new type of
airplane, Bradshaw said, ``I'd run the other way; I'd be watching
from the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question is currency. To be legal, a pilot must have
completed three takeoffs and three landings in the preceding 90
days; otherwise, the pilot must fly with an instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of accidents in spring, because people drag
their airplanes out, and try to remember how to fly,'' Bradshaw
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the plane, one with twin engines is not necessarily safer
than one with a single engine, to judge by the statistics. Among
single-engine planes, those with refinements like a pressurized
cabin, retractable landing gear and more powerful engines may not
be any safer than smaller, more basic models, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot with a twin-engine plane may be tempted to fly into
riskier situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human nature being what it is, sometimes pilots will try to
fly in conditions in twins they wouldn't fly in single,'' said
Richard L. Collins, an editor of Flying magazine, which is written
for private pilots. He has logged 18,500 hours since 1951, more
than many airline pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather can bring down a two-engine plane as easily as one
with one engine, Collins said. ``The conditions don't know the
difference; they don't know how many engines you have.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A pilot with an instrument rating allowing flight in poor
visibility is generally reassuring. But the most important sign is
someone who stays within his limits, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you really want to think about, how much do you trust
this person's judgment,'' said Patrick E. Bradley, an aviation
lawyer who defends pilots and manufacturers in post-crash civil
lawsuits. ``If he has an incredibly type-A personality, and he's
going to get there no matter what, perhaps he takes risks you might
not be comfortable with,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has a commercial pilot's license, said that many
flights would be safe if conducted in good weather, but that if he
agrees to a flight many days in the future, ``I don't know what the
weather conditions are going to be, and it's awkward for me to back
out.'' His solution, he said, is ``I'll just beg off at the
outset.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that the day after he got his license, he took his
mother for a ride; now, he said, he is appalled that he did that.
</P>
<P>
   There are 618,400 people with pilot's certificates, according to
the FAA, of whom about half have instrument ratings, which means
they have been trained to fly straight and level when they have no
visual cues. Of the 618,400, there are 247,200 private pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Among pilots involved in fatal crashes, about half have
instrument ratings, but those with such ratings may also fly more
than those without, so their accident rate may be lower; the
aviation agency does not keep statistics to determine this.
</P>
<P>
   Among pilots involved in fatal accidents between 1989 and 1998,
those with instrument ratings for airplanes had an average of 4,617
hours of experience, according to the aviation agency; those
without such ratings had an average experience of 1,271 hours. The
statistics are somewhat uncertain because for about 5 percent of
the pilots, the records do not show if they had instrument ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Flying only in daylight and in good weather, when an instrument
rating is less important and there is no chance of a thunderstorm
or a cloud that obscures a mountain, will eliminate a great deal of
risk, experts say.

JAYS WANT TO MAKE PLAYOFFS, AND NOT JUST AS WILD CARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did the Toronto Blue Jays overtake the Boston Red Sox
for the best second-place record in the American League than they
proclaimed that the wild-card spot in the playoffs would not be
good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no, no, no,'' Gord Ash, their general manager, said
emphatically. ``The Yankees are a very strong club, but that's
where our sights are set. It's unfortunately not very realistic
when I think they've beaten us six straight times, but we're only
eight back in the loss column and anything can happen. The way
we're playing now we can beat anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays are one of the surprising teams that have added
spice to the division and wild-card races in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the AL West the Oakland Athletics didn't seem to want to
disappear from contention until their No. 1 starting pitcher, Kenny
Rogers, asked to be traded. In the National League, the Cincinnati
Reds have created a race in the Central Division, the San Diego
Padres have catapulted themselves into the West race and the
Philadelphia Phillies can still see the Mets in the wild-card race
_ while the Mets are suddenly crowding the Atlanta Braves in the
East.
</P>
<P>
   Those developments figure to have an impact on trade talks this
week leading to the nonwaiver trading deadline Saturday at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Teams that might otherwise have been willing to trade someone
_pitching is the commodity most in demand, of course _ could now
hold back because of their contending status. Some of those same
teams, now thinking they have a chance, could be in the market for
an acquisition themselves.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, whom the Blue Jays acquired from the Yankees for
Roger Clemens, is one playoff-experienced pitcher who has been
coveted by contenders. But Ash has said all season and reiterated
last week that the club is not trading him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, people keep writing that we are, but we
aren't,'' he said. ``When we signed him to the extension, it was
intimated that we did it because that made him more attractive on
the trade market, but that wasn't our purpose. You need players who
have been through that September situation. He certainly falls into
that category.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays were in position to supplant the Red Sox in second
place in the East and in first place in the wild-card division
Friday night because they had compiled the best record in the major
leagues since June 13, winning 27 of 36 games,
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, at 25-11, and the Mets, at 25-12, had the next best
six-week records. The Yankees had a 23-13 record, which is why the
Blue Jays were able to gain four games in the standing, and the Red
Sox had an 18-19 record, enabling the Toronto upstarts to make up
9{ games on them.
</P>
<P>
   Now it may only be a coincidence, but the Blue Jays began their
charge at the Red Sox and the Yankees the day that Tony Batista
became their shortstop after his acquisition from Arizona. In 35
games, Batista has driven in 27 runs and hit 11 home runs, placing
him third in homers behind Shawn Green (28) and Carlos Delgado
(25).
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he had power,'' Ash said. ``He hit 15 after the break
last year. But we really didn't get him for that purpose. It's a
side benefit. We were looking for defense and he's been
sensational. There was a knock on him for his range and his range
has been fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Batista has replaced Alex Gonzalez, whose services the team lost
for the year in mid-May when he went down with a shoulder injury.
Batista has teamed well with second baseman Homer Bush, whose
average has hovered around .290 and who has had a team-leading 21
stolen bases in 23 tries.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays have also improved because their injured players
got healthy. ``We don't have the depth to our roster to have the
kinds of injuries we had,'' Ash said.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Hamilton has been a more effective starting pitcher since
his return from the disabled list, and Paul Quantrill's return has
bolstered the bullpen. So has John Frascatore, who came with
Batista in the trade for Dan Plesac, a left-handed reliever the
Diamondbacks hoped would solve their closing problems (he didn't).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fregosi, who replaced Tim Johnson as manager in spring
training, has also been a major factor in the team's rise toward
the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that the players wouldn't have played to the same level,''
said the general manager, who made the move because of the fallout
from Johnson's fanciful tales of combat in Vietnam, ``but the
attitude and the atmosphere are tremendously positive.''

 U.S. SEEKS CHANGES IN TRIBUNAL ON WAR CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By PAUL LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States is expected to continue its
campaign against politically inspired war-crimes prosecutions at a
conference about the proposed International Criminal Court that
begins here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The three-week meeting for representatives of about 120
countries that have approved forming such a court has been called
to discuss outstanding technical issues. Those include the court's
rules of evidence and procedure and the precise definition of the
crimes it may try under a mandate covering crimes against humanity,
war crimes, genocide and aggression.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts say they believe the United States will use
these discussions to explore ways of shielding American soldiers
and officials involved in peacekeeping or enforcement operations _
like the recent bombing of Yugoslavia _ from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Fear that its citizens might suffer frivolous or politically
inspired prosecution even if the United States never accepts the
court's jurisdiction led the United States to vote against the
treaty setting up the new tribunal, to which 120 countries agreed
in Rome last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington sees the talks as a way to get a foot in the door
for changing the court's statutes to protect American nationals,''
said William Pace, leader of the Coalition for the International
Criminal Court, a group of 800 organizations around the world that
support the court. ``But the statutes are agreed. The others won't
change them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, a watchdog
organization that supports the court, said: ``The bottom line is
that the United States wants to immunize its soldiers and
policymakers against prosecutions it does not like. The rest of the
world is not going to accept this.''
</P>
<P>
   Only six other countries voted against the treaty, leaving the
United States in the company of China, Israel, Iraq, Qatar, Sri
Lanka and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   So far just three countries _ Senegal, San Marino and Trinidad
and Tobago _ have ratified this treaty, which needs 60
ratifications to go into effect. But 83 countries have signed it _
including all other NATO members except Turkey _ and many are
moving swiftly toward ratification.
</P>
<P>
   As a result the court could well be functioning in The Hague
within three or four years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States has suggested several ways its concerns might
be met but so far they have proved unacceptable to the countries
that agreed to support the court.
</P>
<P>
   Under one proposal, citizens of countries that reject the
court's jurisdiction could only be prosecuted with the consent of
their governments. But that means that rogue states could escape
justice for their crimes by never signing the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal is to require approval for prosecutions by the
U.N. Security Council, where the United States has a veto. But so
do the other four permanent members _ China, Russia, Britain and
France _ which means such a rule would greatly widen the potential
for political interference in cases brought before the court.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the court argue that American citizens are already
well protected against unjustified prosecution by a number of
safeguards in the court statutes approved at Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk of politically motivated prosecutions is almost nil
because of elaborate, overlapping safeguards, many proposed by the
United States,'' said Michael Posner, executive director of the
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, another watchdog group. ``It is
outweighed by the real benefits of having a permanent court
available to deal with future Saddam Husseins.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important of those safeguards is that the primary
responsibility for judging war crime accusations would rest with
the national courts of the accused person's home country. The court
could only try a case when the suspect's home courts were unable or
unwilling to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as the United States has a credible judicial system,
Americans are protected,'' Posner said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the administration eventually gets enough assurances to
be able to sign the treaty drawn up in Rome, the court will face
formidable opponents in the Senate, to which any agreement will be
sent for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has already warned that the treaty
would be ``dead on arrival'' at the Senate Foreign Affairs
Committee, of which he is chairman.

SWISS REVEAL SECRET WORLD: THEIR DEFENSE FROM NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VITZNAU, Switzerland _ A few hundred yards away from the cable
car that brings tourists to the top of scenic Mount Rigi
overlooking Lake Lucerne, a large camouflage-green door carved into
the mountainside opens onto a world that has been secret for 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mountain fortress, part of a vast network of bunkers the
Swiss built during World War II to defend themselves from Germany.
The ``national redoubt,'' as the chain of citadels is called, was
at the core of Switzerland's belief that its national will had
steered it unscathed through the war.
</P>
<P>
   Considerable light has been shed recently on Switzerland's
wartime actions as Hitler's banker, but the idea of Swiss
invincibility remains, especially among the wartime generation.
Only now, with modern-day maintenance costs straining the national
budget, have the Swiss decided to declassify their secret
complexes, and even to start selling some off.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous fortress chain, estimated to have cost $10 billion
in today's dollars, was constructed at a time when German armies
had invaded five neighboring countries. The entry of German troops
into Paris in June 1940 galvanized the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss Army withdrew from its borders, and regrouped in the
Alps, which cut across the country, providing a natural defense
line. This left the low-lying areas, where most of the population
was concentrated, at the mercy of invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Historians question whether Hitler ever intended to annex
Switzerland, or preferred instead to use the country as his
financial conduit, but the Swiss fervently launched the massive
underground works project.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people worked night and day to tunnel into
mountains and construct hiding places for weapons and men. Then,
the entrances were covered over to blend with surrounding foliage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, we would hear the dynamite, and we'd see the
earth move down from the mountains,'' recalled Arthur Joller, the
retired 66-year-old railway worker who is in charge of the Vitznau
Artillery, the fortress built into the side of Mount Rigi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work was always guarded, and we never dared come. It was
absolutely forbidden,'' said Joller, who conducts a tour of the
bunker, two stories high, dug into the side of Mount Rigi. Its
quarter mile of gray cement and stone corridors are lined with
narrow gutters where condensation from the rocks pours off. The
stronghold was designed to accommodate 120 men for a month.
</P>
<P>
   It has a kitchen, with spotlessly clean oversized pots and pans
to feed large numbers, an infirmary, toilets modern by 1940
standards and separate sleeping quarters for officers. It also has
a radio room, war room, huge water tank, disinfection area in case
of a chemical attack, generator, ammunition storage areas and two
105-millimeter cannons.
</P>
<P>
   The cannons, no longer operational, overlook Lake Lucerne, ready
to fire at approaching enemy troops. However, 1956 was their last
test-firing because the noise and vibration damaged windows in
local houses and the village church.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread support for the national redoubts, morale was
sometimes difficult, said Maurice Lovisa, who has been advising the
Swiss Defense Department on the underground fortresses. ``At first
they took soldiers from the region, but their families were
unprotected in nearby villages, so it began to be a problem,'' he
said. ``So they started to take soldiers from farther away.''
</P>
<P>
   Vitznau and the other mountain bunkers _ 70 medium-size citadels
plus more than 10,000 smaller bunkers and command posts _ remained
closed for decades. Even visiting the sites is a matter for
top-level military decision, and forbidden for the three gigantic
command fortresses _ at St. Maurice, the Gothard and, easternmost,
at Sargans _ that were the anchors of the line of the bunkers
across the Alps. Each of those was constructed to hold 1,000
soldiers at a time.  &QL;

<P>
   No Big Dip for the Padres
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 San Diego Padres are doing a poor imitation of the 1998
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres were supposed to be an exact copy, were they not?
Didn't they dismantle their team soon after their World Series loss
to the New York Yankees, just as the Marlins had decimated theirs
after winning the World Series in 1997?
</P>
<P>
   That's what some people thought, but there was one major
difference, as Padres president Larry Lucchino pointed out. The
Marlins, he noted, slashed their payroll by $32 million; the Padres
have actually increased their payroll by a few million, to just
under $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Marlins finished with a 54-108 record, a whopping 52
games out of first. The 1999 Padres were only two games from first
with a 49-45 record when the weekend began. A 24-7 burst that was
built on a major league-best 14-game winning streak was
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Lucchino credited general manager Kevin Towers with creatively
putting the team together and manager Bruce Bochy with using the
players wisely. The Padres have one of the least potent offenses in
the league, but they are one of the best at stealing bases and
runs. ``With the changes we made this winter,'' Bochy said, ``we
knew we lost a lot of power and experience. We're more of a
run-and-shoot-type offense. We have to create runs. Speed is one of
our strengths and we try to utilize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Damian Jackson and Reggie Sanders each have 24 stolen bases, and
Eric Owens has 22. Jackson and Sanders were the payment from
Cincinnati in the controversial Greg Vaughn trade. Owens was signed
as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about what Owens has done for this club,''
Bochy said of the surprising .300-hitting outfielder. ``In spring
training I didn't think I had a spot on the team for him. But every
time he played he hit and fielded well.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Owens, who has never played a full season in the
majors, began the season on the bench, but injuries opened outfield
spots for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taken full advantage of it,'' Bochy said. ``He's a
throwback, a Charlie Hustle-type player who will go all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, an outfielder, and Jackson, at shortstop, have helped
defuse the furor that arose when the Padres traded Vaughn after
having lost Kevin Brown, Ken Caminiti and Steve Finley as free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consulted seven people in the organization, and all seven
of them wanted to make the trade,'' Lucchino said. ``The press
played it up as a salary move. Had we not made that deal, it would
have been for public relations reasons and not baseball reasons. It
was the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other players, center fielder Ruben Rivera, whom the
Padres obtained from the Yankees for Hideki Irabu, has become a
productive hitter after struggling to get his average over .200,
and catcher Ben Davis, the second player picked in the 1995 draft,
has spent a productive first month in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Rivera's ultra-slow start, Bochy said: ``Not playing
winter ball set him back. We wanted him to play, but he wanted to
take time off. He got off to a rough start and his confidence was
shaken, but we kept throwing him out there and he kept getting
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the manager said, already plays like a veteran and will
do most of the catching even after Jim Leyritz and Greg Myers
return from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Among the team's other injured players has been Tony Gwynn, who
twice has been on the disabled list and continues to be plagued by
a strained left calf. He has played in only half of the Padres'
games.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox Rookies Slumping
</P>
<P>
   As the Red Sox sink slowly in the East, here's one element in
their change in fortune:
</P>
<P>
   From May 8 through June 25, three rookie pitchers, Juan Pena,
Brian Rose and Jin Ho Cho, right-handers in their early 20s,
started 12 games and gained eight victories against no defeats as
the team compiled an 11-1 record. In that seven-week span, the Red
Sox, on the strength of a 29-16 record, went from five games out in
fourth place to one game out in second, spending 23 days in first
place along the way.
</P>
<P>
   From June 27 through Friday night, Rose, Cho and another young
right-handed rookie, Tomokazu Ohka, made 11 starts, earning two
victories against five losses as the team compiled a 2-9 record. In
that four-week period, the Red Sox, on the weakness of an 8-16
record, plummeted from one game out to seven games out and lost a
place in the standing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Red Sox should call in a corps of diplomats to
straighten out their United Nations pitching staff. Ohka is
Japanese, Cho Korean, Rose American and Pena, now in the minor
leagues, Dominican.
</P>
<P>
   Closing In on Milestones
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's games, Mark McGwire had 491 career home
runs, Wade Boggs had 2,987 hits and Tony Gwynn had 2,985 hits. Will
McGwire become the 16th player to hit 500 home runs before Boggs
and Gwynn become Nos. 22 and 23 to hit the 3,000 plateau?
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels suffered their eighth consecutive loss Friday
night. With each of seven of those losses, they lost a game in the
standing, plunging from 6{ games behind Texas to 13{.
</P>
<P>
   In the Baltimore Orioles' 5-3 victory over Boston on June 20,
Mike Timlin gained his ninth save. Twenty-six games later, in a 5-2
victory over Boston, Timlin picked up his 10th save. In between,
the Orioles had only one save.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mays, a member of the Minnesota Twins' rookie regiment,
started against Chicago's teams in the space of six days. Against
the Cubs on July 17, he pitched a three-hit shutout. Showing no
favoritism, the 23-year-old right-hander pitched against the White
Sox last Thursday and allowed no runs and five hits in eight and
one-third innings. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A WEEK OF GRIEVING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 25:
</P>
<P>
   In the long week of public mourning for John F. Kennedy Jr.,
Americans found an almost pastoral comfort in their technological
solitude. From separate rooms around the country, we learned about
the crash that took the lives of President Kennedy's son, his wife,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette. Only a
few found a public place to express their sorrow _ on the beach at
Martha's Vineyard or the sidewalk outside the Kennedys' Manhattan
apartment. Most Americans mourned into a television set and grieved
into a computer.
</P>
<P>
   As television news cycled endlessly last week, media-savvy
psychologists and telegenic priests tried to soothe and explain our
collective sadness. Commentators whispered their lamentations over
the footage of some 350 mourners entering and leaving a private
service Friday at an uptown Manhattan church. Meanwhile, for those
who wanted to talk, not listen, there were the computer chat rooms.
Some were so clogged with electronic keening and heartfelt
panegyrics that one writer in The Washington Post described the Web
last week as ``a giant Hallmark card.''
</P>
<P>
   If the television coverage was repetitive and sometimes mawkish,
people watched for hours, as the viewing statistics now show, and
the intensity of this public grief carried several messages. Partly
it stemmed from a nation's collective memory of the child who
softened his elegant parents in the White House and played under
his father's desk. That little boy became a man who, for all his
ease, was also a link to deep scars on the American political
psyche. Indeed, that somber linkage made more striking the sunny
and mannerly way he bore his celebrity when the cameras were
tracking the days of his life rather than the way of his death.
</P>
<P>
   The public will slowly flag in its ability to be vicariously
sad, but the families must follow the stages of a grief more direct
and normal. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., hovering like an old lion
over the younger mourners, endured his duties with strength and
eloquence. His eulogy, with its poignant humor about his own lost
political ambitions, summed up the pain that another foreshortened
life represents for this particular family. ``Like his father,''
the senator concluded piercingly, ``he had every gift but length of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The news cycle will turn more directly now to questions about
why a high-powered, private airplane fell from the night sky, a
moment that feels, suddenly, like a long time ago. After federal
investigators have examined every bend in this broken airplane and
asked about John Kennedy Jr., not as a mythic prince but as an
inexperienced pilot, this crash could find its place not so much in
aviation history as in basic aviation instruction theory. The late
hour, the disappearing horizon, the frailty of a newly unbound
ankle _ all these unspectacular parts of the John F. Kennedy Jr.
story may offer cautionary lessons to future pilots. The
conclusions about what caused this crash and started this
extraordinary week of public distress are months away. Until then,
we have been connected to these deaths in the way we share our
public passions now _ by electronic proxy.

EDITORIAL: THE ORACLE OF THE FED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 25:
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, who has been chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board for a dozen years, is a past master of the art of Delphic
congressional testimony. So perhaps it is understandable that many
congressmen take for granted that he is always that way, and seem
to have trouble understanding him when he decides to make himself
perfectly clear.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened last week, when Greenspan testified before
a House committee on the very day the House was voting for a
massive tax cut. It was, he said, not a good idea. He got to say it
over and over again because Republicans kept seeking Greenspanian
ambiguity where it did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is not a fan of big government, but he is an economist
concerned about a sizzling economy that could rekindle inflation
and that may _ he concedes he is not at all sure _ have produced a
stock-market bubble. Last month the Federal Reserve pushed up
interest rates a bit, and, in one of the more oracular parts of his
testimony, Greenspan seemed to hint that more tightening was
likely. In that atmosphere, the last thing he needs is a tax cut
that would provide more economic stimulus. ``I'm saying, hold off
for a while,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is no economic need for a tax cut now, there
might be one in a few years. As Greenspan noted, the business cycle
should not be presumed dead just because we are in the midst of the
longest peacetime expansion in American history. ``At some point,''
he warned, ``this economy is going to slow down and perhaps slow
down quite significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   That is when a tax cut would be needed. Unfortunately, the bill
passed by the House could provide just the opposite. It calls for a
series of cuts in individual income tax rates, but would delay the
cuts if the interest expense on the federal debt rose. But that is
just what happens as a result of recessions, which cause tax
receipts to fall and welfare costs to rise. The bill would cut
taxes, in other words, unless a tax cut was actually a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   That provision to delay the cuts was put in to pacify Republican
moderates worried about deficits. They bought it, not worrying
about the perverse economic effects or about the fact that it would
delay only the reductions in individual income tax rates, which
happen to be the only parts of the bill that benefit lower- and
middle-income taxpayers. The other parts of the tax bill, including
a reduction in capital-gains tax rates, a phase-out of the estate
tax and a variety of special-interest breaks for corporations,
would not be affected. The campaign contributors seeking those
breaks will be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is treated reverently on Capitol Hill, but it appears
that the Republicans do not want to heed his advice to run a
surplus and pay down the national debt, while saving a tax cut for
when it is needed. It may be up to President Clinton to use his
veto pen to prevent this folly from becoming law.

EDITORIAL: BASEBALL'S MADDENING LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 25:
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball has decided to join the millennium ratings
madness with its own best-of-the-century list. Between now and
September, fans will be asked to examine a list of 100 players and
choose two for each infield position, two catchers, nine
outfielders and six pitchers. In order to correct obvious
oversights, a special panel will be authorized to add up to five
players to the team.
</P>
<P>
   One of the good things about this exercise is that baseball
offers reams of statistics _ hard facts on which to base
comparisons. Thus there is no excuse for wildly improbable choices.
On the other hand, the numbers also tend to skew things in favor of
the great players of yesteryear, obscuring the fact that the
overall quality of play has improved. The variations from the norm
were much greater before, say, 1929, with more 30-game winners
among the pitchers and more .400 hitters. Judgment calls that take
account of the evolutionary nature of the game are therefore
inevitable. Here are ours.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher: Based on the numbers alone, the available six slots
could be filled almost entirely with legends: Cy Young, Walter
Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Grover Cleveland Alexander and Lefty
Grove. Young won 511 games, Johnson 417, the others 300 or well
over _ astounding by today's standards. We'll take Young, Johnson
and Alexander. From the modern era, we'll select Bob Feller, Sandy
Koufax and Tom Seaver. Cardinal fans can substitute Bob Gibson, and
Giants fans Juan Marichal, for Seaver, and we won't complain. There
was little to separate the three.
</P>
<P>
   First Base: Lou Gehrig and Mark McGwire. Gehrig is Gehrig. We
almost chose the great Jimmie Foxx, but how does one not include
McGwire and his 70 home runs in one year?
</P>
<P>
   Second Base: Rogers Hornsby and Jackie Robinson. Hornsby was
simply the best-hitting second baseman of all time. Robinson, the
first black man in the major leagues, began his career relatively
late, but he lit up the National League when he got there. Nobody
could win games like Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop: From the old days, Honus Wagner, who some think is
the best player of all time, an unprovable proposition. From the
modern era, Cal Ripken Jr. The power of Ernie Banks made us pause
here. But Ripken was (and still is) a more complete player.
</P>
<P>
   Third Base. Mike Schmidt and Brooks Robinson. Schmidt struck out
a lot, but he also hit more than 500 homers and fielded well. We
rated Robinson's exceptional grace in the field over George Brett's
and Eddie Mathews' prowess at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher. Johnny Bench, superb at and behind the plate, and Yogi
Berra, an exceptional clutch hitter and student of the game who
wins by a nod over an earlier Yankee, Bill Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   Outfield. There are 34 to choose from, but only nine slots.
Eight are automatic _ Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Ted
Williams, Stan Musial, Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle and Hank Aaron.
The ninth is almost impossible. Tris Speaker, a superb fielder with
a .344 average? Pete Rose, the all-time leader in hits? Or Tony
Gwynn, the most consistent hitter of the '80s and '90s?
</P>
<P>
   We'll take Rose, for his longevity and hustle, and put Gwynn on
our bonus list of five players. That list includes two players from
the old Negro leagues, Josh Gibson, a catcher, and Satchel Paige,
who actually made it to the major leagues at the age of 42, when he
went 6-1 for the Cleveland Indians in 1948. The final two
supplementals are left-handed pitchers, Grove and Warren Spahn.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing here? Relief pitchers, for one thing, like Dennis
Eckersley and Rollie Fingers, both on the best-100 ballot. But no
list is perfect. Baseball fans can be endlessly disputatious, and
the task of making this new list will inspire further argument. But
therein lies the fun of it. As Berra once advised, ``take it with a
grin of salt.''

HOSTETLER RETIRES TO CARE FOR PARALYZED SON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Calif., W.Va.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything was going right for Jeff Hostetler. An ankle injury
from a 1998 preseason game had completely healed and he had spent
the last year getting into top shape. Last month, four teams showed
serious interest in signing him as a backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as though one of the National Football League's most
resilient players and classiest citizens was on his way back to the
playing field at age 38.
</P>
<P>
   Then something happened that dramatically changed Hostetler's
plans. Last month, his 8-year-old son, Tyler, the youngest of his
three boys, was paralyzed from the neck down after an accident on a
sports recreation vehicle he was riding with a 9-year-old friend at
the friend's house near the Hostetler home in Morgantown, W.Va. The
vehicle suddenly tumbled over, flipping Tyler, and leaving him with
several broken vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   Football suddenly became insignificant for Hostetler. He told
teams that his career was on hold. After 15 seasons, nine of them
with the Giants, Hostetler has in effect retired from the NFL to
care for his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concentrating only on him right now,'' Hostetler said in a
telephone interview the other day. ``I have my priorities in the
right spot. The focus is not on football. It's on my son. That is
all that matters and nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler, always an intensely private person, has talked to
only a handful of people about the accident. The Giants' co-owner,
Wellington Mara, called Hostetler to express his concern and offer
whatever help he could. A close friend of Hostetler's arranged a
call to Tyler, a baseball fan, from Barry Larkin, the Cincinnati
Reds' All-Star shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Hostetler has had to watch one of his
three children endure physical trauma. His son Jason was
hospitalized as an infant in 1984, during Hostetler's rookie year
with the Giants, because of heart problems from which he recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler stayed by Jason's side then, and said he planned to
devote all of his attention now to Tyler. ``I will not leave him,''
Hostetler said, ``until he walks again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler declined to discuss details about his son's injuries.
But he did say that Tyler has improved somewhat since the accident
and can now move his toes and has some feeling in his arms.
Hostetler is optimistic that Tyler will regain his ability to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler said he hoped to establish a foundation to help people
who suffer from paralysis, and he talked about dedicating his life
to raising money for a cure.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a number of NFL quarterbacks have experienced
hardships involving family members, their children in particular.
The son of the Buffalo Bills' Doug Flutie was born autistic. The
former Bills quarterback Jim Kelly started a foundation to help
provide money for research on Krabbe's disease, a rare degenerative
disorder that attacks the nervous system of infants; his son is
afflicted with the ailment. The son of former NFL quarterback
Boomer Esiason has cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, quarterback Mark Rypien, a free agent, announced
that he planned to skip training camp this summer because of recent
family adversities. Rypien sat out last season after his 3-year-old
son died of cancer. That year, cancer was also diagnosed in his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart and mind are not there,'' said Rypien, who has not
ruled out signing with San Diego, Seattle or Washington once the
season begins.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler, a third-round draft pick out of West Virginia,
remains one of the best-known athletes in New York because of his
outstanding play for the Giants and the number of charities he was
involved in. His best year with the Giants was 1990, when he
replaced the injured Phil Simms with two games left in the regular
season. He won both those contests and the Giants clinched the East
Division title.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler remained on top of his game throughout the postseason,
leading the Giants to an undefeated playoff record and a 1-point
victory over the Bills in Super Bowl XXV. He completed 20 of 32
passes for 222 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler, who is 6 feet 3 inches and 220 pounds, was a powerful
player, as fast as many defensive backs and just as athletic. In
the locker room he was highly respected for being a candid and a
kind person.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler played for the Raiders both in Los Angeles and
Oakland, where he had two 3,000-yard passing seasons. He threw for
23 touchdowns in 1996, a career high, and then signed with the
Washington Redskins.

   If you've ever spent any private time with major league umpires,
at their homes or out with their families and friends (they have
groupies, too), you might mistakenly think that their egos are even
bigger than their bellies. The self-importance of umpires is
astonishing; they pretend to see themselves as somewhere between
the thin red line that protected the British Empire from its own
barbarism and the U.S. Supreme Court. When more than five umpires
appear together, you expect them to start singing, ``We Are the
Game.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder that most of them have offered up their
resignations, as of Sept. 2, as part of a convoluted plan that may
be a bluff, may be a mistake, may be a brilliant tactic to return
to their jobs as independent contractors rather than unionized
employees. Whatever the plan, these people are desperate for
respect. Umpire righteousness dwarfs the righteousness of doctors
who leave managed-care organizations in a huff, then organize their
own HMOs. It's no joke that God has a stethoscope in one pocket, a
ball-and-strike counter in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I find all this rather endearing. There are fewer and
fewer professionals out there who take themselves and their work so
seriously. There is too much ESPN defensive irony in the world;
half-educated smarties who think that what they do is somewhat
beneath them (their mothers had dreams) and the best way to show it
is by coolly mocking their work.
</P>
<P>
   Umpires do not mock their work. Umpires need to believe that not
only are they the glue and the spine of the only true game, they
are also universal symbols of order, justice and the possibility of
fair play. They are dedicated to eternal vigilance, and they have
taken oaths; this is why obese umpires faint or even die on the
field rather than quit. And it is why they are justifiably angry at
how they have been treated by the pencil-necked accountants who
manage sports, people who have never played the game or, more
important, never policed and judged it.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires have a case. Baseball bureaucracy has long treated
them as necessary but accessory, like traffic cops or waiters.
There is a sense that when machines can do the job, everyone will
be better off. Umpires rarely receive full-hearted league support
in disputes with players and managers, and the continuing trend
toward verbally abusing and even physically attacking amateur
umpires signifies a cultural animosity that organized baseball has
done nothing to counteract.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, changing the strike zone is a betrayal of the
umpirical imperative: There must be standards and they must be
maintained. The strike zone has become the hemline of baseball. It
is despicable enough that more or less of a woman is shown for
marketing reasons, but raising and lowering, widening and narrowing
the strike zone is close to sacrilege.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, umpires have too much dignity to demonstrate against these
outrages. Imagine if every umpiring team just plopped down in the
middle of the infield at the start of a game. Let the ground crews
carry them off in tarps or earth movers. But also alas, umpires
have so little pride in their physical appearance that it is often
hard to take them seriously. Ballplayers detest fat umpires because
it desecrates their game.
</P>
<P>
   So, I say, let them strike or resign, or whatever they call it.
But let them use their time off the field to improve themselves, to
actually become those magisterial arbiters of their fantasies, at
the Umpire Re-education and Fitness Camp, which will be held at an
undisclosed location in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as it takes or until after the World Series
(whichever is later), umpires will attend the following four
workshops, naked except for protective cups, shinguards, masks and
chest pads:
</P>
<P>
   DIET: Cutting down on postgame steaks and booze is not enough.
There's no point in losing 50 pounds if it makes you feel
vulnerable. As the fat is suctioned off, umpires must learn that
butt- and belly-bumping degrade their dignity, and that surrounding
their beleaguered souls with protective flesh is no solution to
their true lack of self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   THERAPY: In short-term counseling, each umpire will explore the
reasons he became an umpire. Was it to get back at the boys who
never chose him into their games, or was it to have some sense of
control, however false, over a chaotic life? Was it the salary and
benefits, the ladies in the lobby?
</P>
<P>
   FITNESS: In courses run by the astoundingly fit National
Basketball Association referees and the theatrical World Wrestling
Federation referees, our umpires will learn to position themselves
not only to view plays but also to obscure the views of players who
disrespect them, shifting just in time to allow a high spike or an
errant throw to mete out justice.
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORT: Motivational speakers will remind them that they are
the reason there is a season, uh-huh, that without umpires players
would kick dirt and spit on each other, and that there would be no
alibis for being caught stealing or watching a third strike. It
will be encouraging for them to hear that managers who pick on
umpires, like Billy Martin and Earl Weaver, tend to be small men
and maybe mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, umpires should feel free to ignore all this,
negotiate with baseball and stay on the job. No one would much care
either way.

SERB OPPOSITION AIDES SAY TIME ISN'T RIGHT TO OUST MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIS, Yugoslavia _ A leading Serbian opposition politician, Vuk
Draskovic, believes that the moment is not yet ripe for ousting
President Slobodan Milosevic. He intended to make a rally here
Saturday night his last for some time, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior aides to Draskovic said they believed that the opposition
was wasting energy by holding an endless series of summertime
rallies that are not attracting enough people to put any real
pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic believes that Milosevic must be induced to leave power
in a way that avoids civil conflict and significant bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said Saturday's meeting in Nis would be Draskovic's
last for at least several weeks, although the other main opposition
grouping, the Alliance for Change, has scheduled further rallies
and says it hopes to lead a grand march on Belgrade sometime in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says Milosevic must go,'' a senior Draskovic aide
said. ``But how? He doesn't even contemplate going. You can ask him
to go for 1,000 days, but asking him isn't serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic will resume mass meetings as an important part of the
strategy to get Milosevic to resign, ``but we want to pick the
right moment, when we can create momentum and there is something
important to say,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Draskovic is concentrating on trying to choose a
transitional government of experts that all the opposition can
agree upon, and then trying to push Milosevic to empower that
government and finally to step aside after new elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Change demands Milosevic's resignation first,
before any transitional government, but pressed by the United
States, Draskovic and alliance leaders are working on a joint
platform as a way to bridge their differences, if not to solve them
all. That platform will include the idea of Milosevic's ouster and
new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic and Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic, who were
allies in the 1996-97 marches against Milosevic, are now bitter
rivals, which has undermined both their reputations and the
credibility of the opposition generally.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and the Serbian opposition are also hoping that
Milosevic's government will begin to crumble from within,
especially with the prospect of new indictments on war crimes from
the International Tribunal in the Hague. Indictments may come soon
of Mirjana Markovic, Milosevic's wife and the leader of the
influential Yugoslav United Left Party, and of Vojislav Seselj, the
ultranationalist leader of the Radical Party and a Serbian deputy
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   They are hopeful that the former army chief of staff, Momcilo
Perisic, who came out last week in sharp opposition to Milosevic
and his government, will attract more army and police support to
the idea of the President's ouster. But Perisic is likely to form
his own party, given his lack of respect for Draskovic, Djindjic or
another former general, Vuk Obradovic, who heads the Social
Democracy Party.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and its European partners will also resume aid to
independent media and opposition parties here, supporting the
argument that there will be no ouster of Milosevic otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are pushing a respected economist, Dragoslav
Avramovic, who helped end Yugoslav hyperinflation in January 1994,
as prime minister of a transitional government. Avramovic is
affiliated with the Alliance for Change, but Draskovic is now more
willing to consider the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Draskovic believes that the timing is not yet right for
the naming of such a government, his aides said. He also considers
that the opposition is dissipating anger at Milosevic with rallies
now that have no idea behind them except Milosevic's ouster and
that offer no serious alternative program behind which citizens
could unite.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic also believes that the West is harming the cause of
the opposition by allowing the majority Albanians to sweep most of
the Serbian minority from Kosovo through intimidation and killings.
</P>
<P>
   That case will be made stronger by the news overnight of the
killing of 14 Serbian farmers in the Kosovo village of Gracko,
despite earlier calls by the farmers for protection from British
troops policing the sector since NATO and the United Nations took
over the province.
</P>
<P>
   There are growing feelings in Serbia that NATO and the West are
not serious about protecting the rights of all the citizens of
Kosovo, including the Serbs. NATO and the United Nations have been
slow to start policing the province in earnest, the Serbs feel, and
government officials have started to suggest that Yugoslav police
and even army troops should return to Kosovo if such killings
continue.

 &HT;    The lost Gamble
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He stood before the judge in federal court, ears
pricked to absorb the magic words: probation, no jail time. Oh, he
knew that pleading guilty to two counts of perjury could bring as
many as five years behind bars. And Lord knows, in today's sports
climate, athletes who wager against their own teams must perform
saintly acts to rise to the level of coach chokers and steroid
users.
</P>
<P>
   But he reminded himself that he had stopped lying about details
of his involvement in a campus football gambling ring and helped
expose a betting virus inflicting the basketball team. That
prominent politicians from Max Cleland to Lewis Massey, many of
them his mother's onetime co-workers, had offered character
references. That he met his degree requirements within four years
in the acclaimed Medlin School of Journalism at lofty Northwestern
University. And that the president of the United States remained a
free man despite having perhaps perjured himself.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Hon. Judge George M. Marovich cleared his throat to
pronounce sentencing on May 7, the self-assured, well-rounded
grown-up kid from an upscale Atlanta neighborhood and the
prestigious Lovett School, the Big Ten wide receiver with an
Olympic sprinter's speed, an orator's diction and a favorite
cousin's charm, expected to skate. He would walk out of the
courtroom and drive off, watching this sordid chapter of his young
life fade to nothing in the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe no tackler has ever jarred him harder than the
judge's words: two months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   After the sentencing
</P>
<P>
   How foretelling was this: The birth certificate of the man whose
testimony paved the way to a record number of criminal indictments
in a sports gambling scandal at one university reads Christopher
Gamble. The irony can be found in his first name, St. Christopher
being the designated guardian on life's journeys.
</P>
<P>
   But his first significant journey _ off to college in 1990 _ was
rerouted to hell in the guise of a Chicago courtroom. It ended with
Gamble, now 27, peering over one shoulder to see his mother begin a
crying jag that would last for days. The shame he heaped upon
Vernetta, a devoted employee to some of Georgia's leaders in
government, and his father Rich, a Morehouse man and onetime
Atlanta police officer of the year, was almost too much to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurt, I was mad,'' he said six weeks later in an
interview at his townhouse in Marietta, a day before entering the
prison camp section of the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. ``But I
was also somewhat relieved. I thought about a Bible verse, `This
too shall pass.' It's been my theme ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   As far back as he remembers, Vernetta and Rich stressed God and
faith above all else, with education a close second, even after
they split up when Chris was 8. One grandfather was a Baptist
minister, the other a deacon.
</P>
<P>
   Home was the Peachtree Hills neighborhood, where Gamble recalls
being the lone black youngster. Living with his mother, he dabbled
in numerous sports until breaking an ankle in a pee-wee league
football game. ``That's it,'' Mom said, and he gravitated toward
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble was fast-tracked toward a top-level youth team run by
Bill Holleman, also soccer coach and athletics director at Lovett.
The Gambles, of modest means, were granted financial aid, and Chris
thrived at the costly, challenging school. His report cards were
all A's and B's, his Lions soccer team's ledger nearly all W's.
``He could walk the walk as well as talk the talk,'' Holleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the soccer club team disbanded before his junior year
did Gamble, faced with free time in the fall, resume football.
``And to get the coach to stop bugging me.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Bill Railey, it was with the purest of intentions. ``I
was worried for him because there weren't a lot of college
scholarships for soccer, and I knew he'd need a scholarship to
go,'' Railey said.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble's renewal with a full-contact sport scared him. ``I had
to get accustomed to getting hit,'' he said. ``I found out I
enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   College coaches enjoyed watching him run down passes, few more
so than Steve Spurrier. On his way from Duke to Florida, Spurrier
was searching far and wide for receivers for his whirlwind offense,
but he came in on Gamble too late. Chris' parents were smitten by
Northwestern's academic demands, which surely he could handle with
his 1,200 score on the entrance exam. And Vernetta was won over by
head coach Francis Peay, an African-American and Christian. ``There
was no choice in the matter,'' Gamble said, meaning his parents
made the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Rich steered him toward a journalism major. As he told Chris,
``You can communicate orally. If you can create on paper, you can
do anything in life.''
</P>
<P>
   After two football seasons, one of them inactive as a redshirt,
he wanted out. ``I couldn't stand it,'' Gamble said. He sassed a
coach who mocked him in practice after a dropped pass (``Do you
need glasses?'' ``No, my eyes are fine.'') and developed a sour
attitude. He plunged into academic probation. Worse, he felt
engulfed by despair on his horrid team.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't care,'' he said. ``Nobody had faith.'' He quoted
a coach, before one game: ``We don't have a snowball's chance in
hell of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble said, ``You have to have a mind-set to overcome that
negativity. I wanted to transfer. My parents wouldn't let me.''
</P>
<P>
   Socially, Gamble adapted. As a freshman, he dated a senior on
the basketball team. She graduated and moved home to California. He
visited her during spring break, and they swung by Las Vegas. Never
before a gambler, he was exposed to a fascinating new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a rush,'' he said, ``a quick way to make a buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble approached these games of chance as he would games of
football or soccer _ a contest that you win by outworking or
outsmarting your opponent, whether it be a defensive back or a
dealer. ``That's where I got in trouble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They cashed in enough chips to pay for the Vegas trip, with $400
left over. Right off the bat, Gamble had a distorted perception of
gaming. Sometimes, when you win, you really lose.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling escalates
</P>
<P>
   Before Gamble's sophomore season, in 1992, Francis Peay was
replaced by the inspirational Gary Barnett. In his introductory
team address, Barnett enthused about guiding the Purple to Pasadena
_ the Rose Bowl _ a path last traveled in '49. Many players thought
Barnett was wack but Gamble welcomed him. ``He gave me a fresh
start.'' He also gave Gamble, no shrinking violet for the Purple,
jersey No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   If Gamble wasn't a team leader in the locker room, he was in the
living quarters. He helped organize poker games on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. The stakes would start at a nickel, dime or quarter, but
inevitably would escalate to a dollar. The luckiest player might
walk away from the table with a $200 profit.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gamble found a slice of Las Vegas in the Midwest. Maybe
twice a month as a senior, now living off campus, he would take
what was left over from his $700 monthly scholarship stipend checks
after paying the bills and head to riverboat casinos on the
Desplaines River in nearby Joliet, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, he won. But as the gambling gods giveth at
the blackjack and craps tables, they taketh away at the sports
bookmaker.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the wagers were small, five or 10 bucks per football
game. For a gambler, that's dipping a toe in the water before
diving in. Gamble had no trouble finding a bookie. Brian Ballarini
arrived at Northwestern on a football scholarship but an injury
ended his college career before it began. He maintained a rapport
with former teammates by accepting bets from them.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble became a regular, and a semi-regular loser. He remembers
plunking down $300 one Sunday in 1993 on Pittsburgh, a 1 1/2-point
favorite at home against the Browns, after hearing Cleveland return
specialist Eric Metcalf was hurt. He turned on the TV for the
kickoff. ``And who do I see warming up?'' he said. ``Eric
Metcalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf dragged his sore knee to punt returns of 91 and 75 yards
for touchdowns as the Browns won 28-23. ``Soon as I lost that
$300,'' Gamble said, ``I thought, `I'm gonna get it back.'''
</P>
<P>
   How? Increase the next bet.
</P>
<P>
   The wagers were not placed blindly. He would analyze matchups
and conclude, say, that a Big Ten member he had faced lacked
sufficient speed against a team from another conference. Yet, his
debt to Ballarini skied to about $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gamble went from dumb to dumber. He bet against his own
team.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, 1994, Ohio State was favored by 15 points. ``To me,
it was almost a no-brainer,'' he said, to assume that his team
would fall by far worse. ``Our quarterback was hurt. They'd beat us
51-3 the year before. We were 1-1-1. I thought we were going to get
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble wanted to erase his entire tab with a single bet, but
Ballarini limited him to $500 on the Ohio State game.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have to be double-jointed to bend over backward far enough
to justify such a desperate act. But Gamble tries: ``I knew going
in that what I was doing was wrong, but I didn't see the harm in
it. I was betting with a kid at school, not a (professional)
bookie.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble insists that he played hard that day. ``I was trying to
get to the NFL. I still had a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, so did his teammates. Northwestern led 9-0 at halftime.
For a moment, the money was forgotten. ``Wow,'' Gamble said to
himself, ``we're going to a bowl. We've turned it around.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was clear the Wildcats would cover the spread, meaning
they would not lose by more than 15 points, Gamble remembered the
bet. He told fellow receiver and co-captain Michael Senters,
another suspected gambler, ``I just bought myself a $500 bowl
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, he only bought himself more trouble. The worst
possible scenario unfolded. Northwestern lost 17-15 when a
potentially game-tying two-point conversion carry by the dazzling
running back Dennis Lundy fell short. Gamble was a double loser,
game and bet. He was $1,600 in the red, so the senior who had
started college with a $100 bank account opened by his mother and
now was risking five times that amount on games and got cut off by
his bookie.
</P>
<P>
   Ballarini was not, however, lacking for business. In a plea
agreement, he confirmed that 12 to 15 players were customers.
</P>
<P>
   One was Lundy, who also invested $500 on the Ohio State game.
His ballooning debt dated to the season opener, when he risked $200
on Northwestern against Notre Dame. The Wildcats, underdogs by 26
points, closed to within 27 on a late touchdown. Lundy sprinted
onto the field so he, instead of some backup, could run in the
two-point conversion and ensure his team would cover the spread.
</P>
<P>
   Innocently, the coaches summoned him back. As Lundy agonized on
the bench, the conversion failed and Notre Dame rewarded its fans _
and bettors _ with a 42-15 win.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gamble, who rarely touched the ball most games, Lundy
could affect an outcome. His was the most frequently called number
in the huddle. And it was called during the season's penultimate
game at Iowa after the Hawkeyes had handed over a fumble at their
1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The next play went to Lundy, whose team was a 5 1/2-point
underdog and trailed 35-14. Lundy fumbled it right back _ unhit.
</P>
<P>
   On the sideline, a defensive player getting his ankle taped
muttered that Lundy must have bet on a game again. The trainer
tipped off a graduate assistant, and up the chain of command went
the hot-potato remark, all the way to Barnett. By Monday, a school
investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble dismissed the rumors about Lundy. ``You'd gotta be
crazy'' to fumble intentionally, he thought. ``No one would do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lundy did, to relieve a debt. When Iowa won 49-13, his tab with
Ballarini shrunk by $400.
</P>
<P>
   Scandal unravels
</P>
<P>
   One more game, one final loss, and Gamble was gone, having
relished only 11 victories in college after his two Lovett teams
went 25-2. He yearned to play on a winner again and, undrafted by
the NFL, signed a free-agent contract with the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   In training camp, he disappeared amid a crowd of veteran
receivers and ultimately was waived, but that was the least of his
troubles. The agents calling him now were not sports agents.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI had entered the Northwestern case. Gamble was
interviewed twice, then appeared before a grand jury. Some
excerpts:
</P>
<P>
   _ On whether he ever owed Ballarini $1,600: ``I don't recall
ever being in debt to him that much.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On how frequently he bet: ``Maybe once a month, maybe twice a
month.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On whether he had to pay an interest charge, known as
``juice,'' on losing bets: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities eventually totaled up three lies. They claim he did
owe $1,600, that he bet several times a week for a total of $10,000
to $15,000 and that he paid juice _ a bookmaker's profit.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing for his future in pro football, Gamble says he tried to
make it sound like innocent fun.
</P>
<P>
   He was summoned back by the FBI two years later, confessed to
lying and returned to the grand jury. He told the truth but not
nothing-but-the-truth. One response came back to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Any betting with respect to Northwestern University games?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, not on football.
</P>
<P>
   He explains now: ``There was nothing I was ashamed of except
that. So I lied.''
</P>
<P>
   After the second grand jury appearance, Gamble figured his legal
business was done. He still had no lawyer, a potentially grievous
lapse in judgment because one might have advised him to plead the
Fifth Amendment and decline to answer questions about his betting.
Gamble says he was confused by his interrogators' instructions on
that option, but assistant district attorney and prosecutor Patrick
Collins says his rights were ``exhaustively'' made clear to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I gotten an attorney from Day One,'' he said in the
interview at his townhouse, ``I would not be here talking to you
about this.''
</P>
<P>
   With his latest lie, the investigators' gloves came off. They
pursued him to Atlanta for more questioning. ``This time,'' he
said, ``they weren't playing around.''
</P>
<P>
   They blamed him for dragging out the inquiry. They stressed the
gravity of perjury. Gamble, the journalism grad, followed the news.
He knew what Bill Clinton was going through in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal. He got scared.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he came clean. And he continued to unfurl a tale about
which investigators knew next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the guy that turned us on to the whole basketball
thing,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble detailed how he and a pal had put guard Dion Lee in
contact with Kevin Pendergast, a former high school soccer
All-American and Notre Dame kicker turned bookie. How Gamble drove
Lee, who owed him money, to Buffalo Joe's restaurant. How Lee went
in, returned to the car clutching an envelope filled with cash and
gave some to Gamble. The money apparently was Lee's payoff for
throwing a game.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with those leads, investigators discovered evidence of
three basketball games fixed by Lee and two teammates in the
1994-95 season.
</P>
<P>
   Family last to know
</P>
<P>
   Last Dec. 4, Gamble was indicted on two counts of perjury. He
had kept his father Rich, now a Naval Investigative Service special
agent in St. Marys on the southeast Georgia coast, in the dark.
Rich was out, on his daily swim, and missed Chris' call on the eve
of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   When he turned on ESPN, Rich heard that four players from
Northwestern's 1994 team had been indicted. He thought, ``Hmm, must
be some of Chris' friends.'' The first name reported was his son's.
</P>
<P>
   (Chris said he also hid the matter from his mother. She declined
to be interviewed for this story.)
</P>
<P>
   Gamble eventually pleaded guilty. The sentence, which includes
three years' probation, requires him to share his ordeal on behalf
of the NCAA with athletes at other universities.
</P>
<P>
   His only speech so far was directed to a rapt audience of about
100 at Georgia State. Gamble felt nervous but not from stage
fright; at Northwestern he often addressed high school groups.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the edge of a stage, declining a microphone, Gamble
made the painfully public confession that he had humiliated his
parents, disgraced the family name, threatened his career
ambitions. ``For the rest of my life,'' he said, ``when I fill out
a job application, I need to check the `convicted felon' box.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Saum, the NCAA director of agent and gambling activities,
and Cathy Jones, GSU assistant athletics director for compliance,
described the scene in identical words: ``You could hear a pin
drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Saum: ``He's a very eloquent young man. He has a gift _ relating
to athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones: ``It was much more effective than us saying to
student-athletes, `Just don't do it.' I'm hoping to invite him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Gamble was not connected to game-fixing and because he
lifted the veil on basketball gambling, a sentence shorter than the
6-to 12-month guidelines was recommended. But if Gamble hoped to
get off scot-free, he was deluding himself. The judge also had to
weigh a more recent run-in with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble had taken work at the Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch clothing store
in Cumberland Mall. Last year, he pleaded guilty to theft by taking
and shoplifting, which resulted in five years' probation. Cobb
County prosecutors say he issued 48 fraudulent cash refunds to
friends totaling $6,885.61. They say he ``removed'' $232.50 worth
of merchandise from the store and helped three friends ``remove''
$406 in goods.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble says the refund scam _ taking liberties with employee
discounts _ was commonly practiced by the store's sales staff.
Asked for comment, a spokesman at Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch corporate
offices said he would look into Gamble's sweeping accusation but
did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he so often exercised poor judgment, Gamble thought
long and hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends,'' he said, ``tell me that I'm someone who doesn't
always see the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernetta Gamble was in Chicago for the perjury sentencing. Rich
Gamble was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think what he did was that grave _ more of an immature
thing than criminal,'' he said. ``But what Chris did could easily
have been avoided if he'd only to come me first.'' Because he did
not, Rich reasoned, Chris was on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Chris portrays his father as a proud, image-conscious man
``24/7.'' As a cop whose beat was the downtown Atlanta Zone 5, Rich
would go to work each morning with a goal of catching five felons.
``And pretty much for one year,'' he said, ``I did.'' His scrapbook
documents five awards for outstanding police work.
</P>
<P>
   On the mornings before his shift began, Rich would haul young
Chris out of bed. Dad would strap on his bulletproof vest to
simulate chasing criminals, and they would run wind sprints up the
steep Peachtree Hills streets. ``That's why Chris is so fast,''
Rich said. ``And I was the second-fastest cop in the department.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he admits to being one resentful father. ``Of course, I
am,'' he said. ``Look at what it's cost him.''
</P>
<P>
   Avoid mistakes in life, he preached to Chris almost daily when
they lived together, ``because society makes you pay if you're a
minority. Now he has this anchor to drag around the rest of his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris feels an occasional tug on that anchor. A letter arrived
shortly before he was off to prison advising him that, as a felon,
he could no longer vote. In contrast to most young adults, he had
never missed an election since turning 18. The letter provoked
thoughts of African-Americans throughout history who had been
turned away at the ballot box, and now he was one of them _ by his
own hand.
</P>
<P>
   Chris believes his father is finally coming to grips with his
missteps. Not long ago, they fly-fished together, a tradition that
dates back to when Chris was 8 and the kid fell into freezing
waters after insisting he tag along. Dad made him shiver, soaking
wet, until the fishing was done. Tough love always was Rich's
style.
</P>
<P>
   Rich received a letter the other day _ return address, Atlanta
Federal Pen. Chris depicted life there as ``football camp without
the football.''
</P>
<P>
   `Chris was a con'
</P>
<P>
   Gamble's legacy at Northwestern is muddled. There were his three
seasons as a starter. His 10-catch, 146-yard gem against Illinois,
a 27-26 win after his team trailed by three touchdowns, that earned
him Big Ten Player of the Week. A six-catch game against Michigan.
Consistently high grades for performance by coaches. Effective
recruiting pitches to young prospects, which helped fulfill that
crazy Gary Barnett's Rose Bowl promise _ just one year after Gamble
left.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also Gamble's bitterness toward the university for
``abandoning us.'' And there is Barnett's lasting impression of
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris was a con,'' said Barnett, newly named coach at
Colorado. ``When I talked to him about the gambling, he lied to me.
I found him likable at first, but I got burned by Chris, and I
don't trust him. We were constantly having to get Chris to do the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And as a player?
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris was fast. Decent in practice,'' he said. ``He just never
made the big catches'' in games.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven persons connected to Northwestern gambling, including
four football and three basketball players, were indicted. Nine
have pleaded guilty _ four to sports bribery, four to perjury, one
to interstate gambling. (Among the perjurers was Dennis Lundy, who
left Northwestern as its career rushing leader despite the yards he
sacrificed on plays to win his bet.) Michael Senters was sent to
pre-trial diversion.
</P>
<P>
   The only case left hanging involves Dwight Brown, a football
player, who has pleaded innocent to perjury. His trial is scheduled
for Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Gamble hopes to be back on the job as a buyer for an
unidentified large corporation that promised to hold the position
open, playing golf, worshipping in church, warning college athletes
about the perils of gambling and avoiding all manner of betting
except the occasional Super Bowl or March Madness pool. He no
longer peeks at point spreads in the newspaper and tells friends
who ask for advice on a game that he cannot help them.
</P>
<P>
   The closest he has gotten lately to full-scale wagering was at
the movies. He paraphrases the Matt Damon character in
``Rounders,'' a poker player, reciting the gambler's lament: ``Not
many true gamblers can tell you about the pots they've won, only
pots they've lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gamble's biggest bet was not at the card table, nor at the
casino, nor at the bookmaker's. It was at the grand jury, when he
bet that he could lie and get away with it.

 &HT;    FSU's Bowden counters son's pitches perfectly
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some leftovers from last week's ACC football meetings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida State coach Bobby Bowden turns 70 on Nov. 8 but don't
think for a minute he's any less competitive. Son Tommy, now the
head coach at Clemson, tells the story about brother Terry who,
during his early days at Auburn, used age against his father in the
recruiting process. Terry Bowden started telling recruits that his
father probably wouldn't be coaching much longer in an effort to
lure them away from Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bowden had the perfect, but chilling, response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy let it go for about two weeks before he decided to
respond,'' said Tommy Bowden. ``Then he started telling recruits:
`I'll be at Florida State longer than Terry will be at Auburn.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't mess with Daddy. He's still pretty sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The ACC missed a chance to lock in a fifth bowl agreement when
the Music City Bowl in Nashville signed a deal with the Big East.
The ACC currently has teams guaranteed to the Bowl Championship
Series, the Gator, Peach, and Micron PC Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC coaches can't understand why the league can't get half
its teams locked into bowls, while the SEC has seven slots
reserved. Several coaches admitted that SEC schools use it against
them in recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the ACC to pursue a slot in the new Mobile Alabama Bowl
being run by ESPN analyst Mike Gottfried. This year's game will
match the WAC No. 2 against Conference USA No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Atlanta Sport Council is talking to the conference about
bringing the ACC men's basketball tournament to the Georgia Dome in
2005 and 2006. League officials first want to see how the event
fares at the Dome in 2001, its first trip back to Atlanta since
1989. But if the ACC waits that long, the SEC will probably come in
and lock up the Dome with a multiyear deal. The SEC Tournament is
here in 2000 and 2002, in Nashville in 2001, and in New Orleans in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   _ N.C. State coach Mike O'Cain suddenly has a lot of friends who
wear North Carolina blue. O'Cain's team opens the season on Aug. 28
at Texas, coached by Mack Brown. The Tar Heels are not happy with
Brown, who left Chapel Hill suddenly in March of 1998. ``I had one
guy tell me that it hurt him to pull for N.C. State, but that he
hoped we beat their butts,'' said O'Cain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Virginia has lost its best linebacker, Donny Green, to
academics. ``Yeah, I saw it coming,'' said coach George Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida State wide receiver Peter Warrick, who will likely be
taken near the top of next year's NFL draft, has a $3 million
insurance policy against a career-ending injury. The policy is
sponsored by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   One man's opinion
</P>
<P>
   Keith Dunnavant has an interesting feature in his newest Paydirt
Illustrated magazine. He lists 10 ``Plays of the Century'' in SEC
football. Among them are Alabama's goal-line stand against Penn
State in the 1979 Sugar Bowl and the 93-yard Buck Belue-to-Lindsay
Scott pass that lifted Georgia over Florida in 1980. It's good
reading.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another reason to be frustrated with the NCAA. A 27-member
panel charged with improving academic performance in college
basketball, where only 41 percent of the players graduate, tries to
tie scholarships to graduation rate. Graduate all the players, get
14 scholarships. Graduate none, get 12. That's incentive?
</P>
<P>
   _ A recommendation that will improve the academic standing of
all athletes: Mandatory attendance at summer school before the fall
of the freshman year. Athletes should learn where the library is
located before attending their first practice. The cost would be
part of the scholarship. In some cases we have college football
players who participate in a game before they attend their first
class. Wrong, wrong, wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas defensive end Carlos Hall has been arrested on a
forgery complaint. Police say he stole three checks made out to the
school and cashed them at a bank.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former athletics director Tom Butters will be among five new
members enshrined into the Duke Sports Hall of Fame on Sept. 24.
Butters' ability as an administator and fund-raiser made him one of
the most powerful athletics directors in the country. He also hired
a little-known guy named Mike Krzyzewski as the school's basketball
coach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Vanderbilt football coach George MacIntyre is battling
multiple sclerosis. MacIntyre, 58, first felt the symptoms of MS
two years ago. He was the last Vandy coach to beat Tennessee and
Alabama and take the Commodores to a bowl game. He lives in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Knoxville News-Sentinel reported this week that John
Rattay, the brother of Louisiana Tech quarterback Tim Rattay,
visited Tennessee last week. John Rattay, from Tempe, Ariz., is
also a quarterback prospect.

 &HT;    Respect finally is Falcons'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like just about everyone else who knew anything of the
Falcons, Dan Reeves drew a quick first impression. It wasn't good.
After interviewing to become head coach, he embraced the majority
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   This was a hopeless franchise, and it wasn't just the sight of a
weight room without a floor, of weights resting on dirt under the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, a native of Americus, Ga., was picking up all kinds of
bad vibes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come in the worst way because this was coming back
home,'' he said. ``But it just wasn't the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 1977 was 20 years too early. Reeves, then 32, had just
finished his first season as offensive coordinator of the Dallas
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, on the other hand, had two winning seasons in their
first 11. The '76 season was a mess, as Marion Campbell was
replaced after going 1-4 by Pat Peppler, who went 3-6.
</P>
<P>
   But as defending NFC champions, the Falcons' image has changed.
With their training camp opening days away, most of the improvement
seems to have happened since Reeves arrived in '97.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons began 1-7, but closed 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, not even Reeves' open-heart surgery in December
could derail a train than went 16-3, and wasn't derailed until
falling to Denver in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   It almost made president Taylor Smith and the family that has
owned the team since '66 forget the worst of the past.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible, though, not to remember all the ugly
comparisons made by media and fans of the family of late owner
Rankin Smith, and the Clampetts, the hillbilly clan of TV fame that
struck it rich in oil and moved to Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, it was (late Journal-Constitution columnist) Lewis
Grizzard (who coined the comparison),'' Smith said, ``and then...
Sports Illustrated wrote an article about how (Atlanta was)
Losersville, that we were the two worst pro franchises in one city,
the Braves and Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get those... tags. The name fit, though, in
tough times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' track record for bungling things was immense, and
not just on the field. Rankin Sr., who was born into a wealthy
family that founded the Life Insurance Co. of Georgia, bought the
team for $8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   He had no clue how to run a football team. And differences
between the team's scouting and coaching staffs exacerbated the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Rankin Sr. often made the final decisions anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at times folks were as interested in his private
life, which was marked by occasional legal scandals, battles with
alcohol and occasional buffoonery.
</P>
<P>
   There was the time he and friend and their dates put a yacht on
automatic pilot, and, while drinking scotch, rammed the boat into a
reef off Bimini.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking trips with him was like one of those National Lampoon
Vacation movies, with Chevy Chase,'' his first wife, Meme Smith,
told the Wall Street Journal. ``He'd make all these plans and
everything would go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It got better for a while when Rankin Jr. was made club
president in '77, although his interview with Reeves didn't work
out.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Reeves cringe at the spartan weight room under team
offices in Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, but he didn't much like
the fact that when the Braves were playing, the Falcons had to bus
to a park just to practice.
</P>
<P>
   There was more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were talking about hiring Eddie LeBaron, a former Cowboys
quarterback, as general manager at the same time,'' Reeves
recalled. ``I respect LeBaron, but he wasn't even involved in
football at the time. He was an attorney in Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   So the team hired Leeman Bennett, who engineered the best
stretch in franchise history, going 7-7, 9-7, 6-10, 12-4, 7-9 and
5-4. He was fired, he was told, because he couldn't take the team
to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   By the late '80s, Rankin Jr. was embroiled in a messy paternity
suit, and stepped down as president. To this day, although he
remains on the board of directors, he's virtually invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forwarding through the mostly ill-fated tenures of coaches
Dan Henning, Marion Campbell (again), Jim Hanifan (briefly), Jerry
Glanville and June Jones, an important decision was made.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had dug a big hole,'' Taylor Smith said. ``I don't want to
get into it, but it was just a fact that we operated that way (with
coaching and scouting staffs with separate agendas) for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we always said, if we ever had a chance to hire somebody
like Dan, we wanted to do it. The change began as soon as Dan got
here. It was all about leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   And power.
</P>
<P>
   ``My major concern was that if I'm going to be given the
responsibility,'' he said, ``I wanted the authority.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he does. Reeves signs off on virtually every move.
Scouting department reports are reviewed by the coaches. But Reeves
makes the final calls there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important is a new mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   He remembered from his first interview being surprised to learn
that the Falcons didn't factor character or intelligence into draft
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   His team, however, is based as much on that as X's and O's.
</P>
<P>
   The team fell to 1-7 in `97 the day after Rankin Sr. died, only
to go 22-5 since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, it's a coincidence'' Reeves said. ``They made a
commitment to change, and they were going to have somebody run the
football operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a special kind of person (to be a player). If you've
got to use the whip every day, you're not going to be successful.
You've got to have people who are self-motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest ingredients in last year's success _ and
perhaps the most unstable _ was chemistry on a roster assembled
largely by Reeves and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely get a feel that there's more discipline,'' said
defensive end Lester Archambeau, who was acquired in trade from the
Green Bay Packers in `93. ``Guys seem more committed to the sport.
With that, you get a better character of person on and off the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect can be found at the ticket office, at cash registers
from coast to coast and publicity for the players.
</P>
<P>
   Season ticket sales are up about 10,500, about 35 percent. At
this time last year the Falcons were 29th in merchandise sold
nationally, trailing even the nonexistent Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they're 20th.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were valued last year at $233 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Aspen, Colo., Falcons running back Jamal Anderson
appeared in a fund-raiser to fight breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing the reach the Falcons have all of the sudden,''
said Brian McCarthy, the NFL's corporate communications manager.
``Jamal couldn't go four or five feet without somebody stopping him
and asking him to do the `Dirty Bird' (dance).''
</P>
<P>
   But success can be fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   Several personnel moves could catch up with the Falcons, or the
injury bug they largely avoided last season could bite hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had one year of success,'' Reeves said. ``To me, it's
only going to change if we do it on a consistent basis, and compete
to where fans can be proud of us year in and year out.''
</P>
<P>
   Archambeau is enjoying it while he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that (before) I was walking around town, and
nobody cared that I played for the Falcons,'' he said. ``I probably
get stopped about 10 times more than before. It's like a
caterpillar that goes into a cocoon and comes out a beautiful
butterfly.

 &HT;    Shoeless made mark in Americus
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMERICUS, Ga. _ The real ``Shoeless Joe'' didn't vanish when he
was banned from organized baseball, not to reappear on a diamond
again until an Iowa farmer plowed under part of his cornfield.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Jackson played and managed anywhere and everywhere he could,
finding his ``Field of Dreams,'' if not redemption, in dusty
ballparks throughout his native South and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson didn't really play in Dyersville, Iowa. But he did swing
his famous ``Black Betsy'' bat in Americus and other towns in
southwest Georgia, where fans flocked to see the former
major-league star.
</P>
<P>
   A marker outside Thomas Bell Stadium tells part of the rest of
the story, but it is misleading. Although seemingly ancient, the
wooden stadium wasn't built until 1938. The summer that Jackson
briefly put Americus in the nation's sports headlines was 15 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1923, just two years after Jackson and seven Chicago
White Sox teammates were banned for life by commissioner Kenesaw
Mountain Landis, even though they were acquitted in court of
throwing the 1919 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the Landis edict, the Americus team of the independent
South Georgia League signed Jackson for $75 a week on July 16 _ and
touched off a firestorm.
</P>
<P>
   Although technically not under his domain, other teams in the
unofficial minor league were fearful of Landis, who threatened to
ban anyone who played with or against any of the Black Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Several newspaper writers came out strongly against Jackson,
with sports editor Morgan Blake of The Atlanta Journal likening him
to Benedict Arnold and claiming that some crimes can never be
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson said his foes ``were making a tempest out of a
teapot'' and said opposing teams were afraid of ``that long bat I
swing.'' He took the field at Americus on July 20 against
Bainbridge and hit a triple in his first at-bat, then a double in
his second. Despite rain, 600 fans turned out on a Friday afternoon
at the old Barlow ballpark, next to the Americus swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson, managing as well as batting cleanup and playing
right field, continued to hit, the crowds grew bigger and the
protests fewer. Everyone wanted to see Jackson, who had just turned
34 and feasted on South Georgia League pitching after hitting .356
during a 13-year major league career.
</P>
<P>
   The Americus team, formed by Bell, was in last place in the
six-team league when Jackson arrived. But it won the second half of
the split season and played Albany for the title in what was
advertised as Georgia's Little World Series.
</P>
<P>
   With Jackson going 11-for-22 and hitting two homers in the
second game, Americus won the series in six games. The opener in
Americus drew more than 2,000. Capacity crowds had become the norm
everywhere Jackson played.
</P>
<P>
   Fans came to see Jackson hit, but he also thrilled them in the
field. An over-the-shoulder catch he made in the playoffs was
called by an Americus sportswriter ``the most sensational and
spectacular play ever seen on a minor-league diamond.''
</P>
<P>
   But an appearance by the infamous ``Shoeless Joe'' was treated
as more than just a game. It was an event. Band concerts and
barbecues frequently preceded the games. One poster told the fans,
``This is the day that you young married people can tell your
children about in the afteryears.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had played in the North and Southwest under assumed
names before coming to Americus, but he clearly enjoyed displaying
his talents again in his native South. He owned a cleaning business
in Savannah and called the coastal Georgia city home for most of
the 1920s before moving back to Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1923 season, Jackson took out a lease on the
poolroom at the Windsor Hotel, and Americus fans hoped he would be
back to play the next season.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sept. 6, Jackson and pitcher Lefty Wingard signed with a
team in Waycross. Jackson played with several teams in the next few
years, with Waycross being one of his common stops.
</P>
<P>
   The South Georgia League _ which had been made up of Americus,
Albany, Bainbridge, Blakely, Dawson and Arlington _ wasn't around
in 1924, anyway. Dawson and Arlington disbanded a week before the
end of the 1923 season, and Bainbridge didn't show up for a final
regular-season series at Americus.
</P>
<P>
   Hard feelings remained about the use of Jackson and other
questionable players, many of whom had been blacklisted from
oraganized baseball. Thomas Bell had resigned from his duties with
the Americus team before the first game of the Albany championship
series because of a dispute over players and umpires.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Americus joined official minor-league baseball and
played in the Georgia-Florida League until the early 1950s. Bell
became mayor and led the push for a new stadium, which opened on
July 12, 1938. The Barlow ballpark, where Jackson had played, was
torn down in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Despite continued talk that Jackson should be in the Hall of
Fame, his days in Americus are all but forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who would have seen him play are long since
dead,'' said Gilly Pervis, 92. ``That was a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   JOE JACKSON FILE
</P>
<P>
   Born: July 16, 1889, in Pickens County, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Died: Dec. 5, 1951, in Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Nickname: ``Shoeless Joe'' was bestowed on him in 1908 after he
played in a minor-league game for Greenville at Anderson, S.C.,
without his spikes because of blisters on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Family: Married Katie Wynn in 1908. No children.
</P>
<P>
   Position: Outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league teams: Played with Philadelphia A's (1908-09),
Cleveland Indians (1910-15) and Chicago White Sox (1916-20).
</P>
<P>
   Career stats: Hit .356, with a high of .408 in 1911. Hit .382 in
his final season.
</P>
<P>
   Postseason stats: Hit .304 in the 1918 World Series and .375 in
1919.
</P>
<P>
   Downfall: Accused of collaborating with seven other White Sox
players to throw the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. All
players were acquitted by a Chicago jury in 1921. But commissioner
Kenesaw Mountain Landis still banned them for life for associating
with gamblers.

A HOUSECLEANING AT REDSKIN PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shuffling of the Washington Redskins' front office has
telephone lines burning in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Charley Casserly, one of the most respected general managers in
football, was removed from his old position and is now an adviser
to the Redskins' new owner, Daniel Snyder. He will not be there for
long, league insiders say. Look for him to leave Washington soon
for a position with another team.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins' new public-relations director, John Konoza,
resigned after only a few days on the job. Snyder dismissed some 25
employees, including secretaries and much of the public-relations
staff. Konoza, perhaps seeing that he was not in the most stable of
situations, left the team.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Vinny Cerrato, the newly hired director of player
personnel. If there is anyone who can help clean up the mess, it's
he.
</P>
<P>
   Cerrato's is not a highly publicized name, but he was the secret
weapon of the San Francisco 49ers' front office for the past eight
years, running both the college and pro personnel departments.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, the 49ers, always picking near the bottom of
every round because they were regularly in the playoffs, still
managed to draft excellent players. They included wide receivers
Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes and safety Merton Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 until this year, Cerrato was involved in one way or
another with bringing every player to the 49ers except wide
receiver Jerry Rice and quarterback Steve Young. It was that track
record that attracted the Redskins to him.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is responsible for turning around the Redskins, who have
not made the playoffs for six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can win immediately without mortgaging the
future,'' he said. ``It's about changing the attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Redskins coach Norv Turner has not been the answer since
replacing Richie Petitbon in 1994. But Turner won a power struggle
that ended with the jettison of Casserly and must know that if he
does not win this season, he will in all probability be unemployed
at the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   Future Brightens for Lett  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Leon Lett should breathe a sigh
of relief. He will most likely be playing football after all at
some point this season.
</P>
<P>
   Reports surfaced last week that Lett had applied for
reinstatement to the NFL after being suspended last month for the
third time in four years because of violation of the league's
substance-abuse policy. The reports suggested that commissioner
Paul Tagliabue may be relatively lenient.
</P>
<P>
   Lett faces up to a one-year suspension but Tagliabue has wide
latitude when it comes to punishing violators of the policy. He
apparently feels that since Lett has been tested up to 10 times a
month for the past two years and has not missed any after-care
meetings, he deserves some consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the suspension has not yet been set, though four
games seems most likely. A 10-game suspension, however, remains a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Rams Face Problem in Faulk
</P>
<P>
   If the St. Louis Rams are not careful, they could have a
disaster on their hands. Their star running back, Marshall Faulk,
the best all-round back in pro football last year with 1,316 yards
rushing and 86 catches, may be on the verge of a long holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk has failed to report to training camp because he wants a
new deal. He has two years remaining on a contract that pays him
$2.2 million a season, but wants $5 million a year and a signing
bonus of more than $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis cannot afford to have Faulk in a long holdout. While
Faulk is out of camp, the No. 1 back is Greg Hill. If Coach Dick
Vermeil wants to finally turn the Rams around, Faulk needs to be in
camp soon.
</P>
<P>
   Around the League
</P>
<P>
   _ A common assumption is that Giants quarterback Kent Graham
will be replaced at some point in the season by the backup Kerry
Collins. One thing is certain: Graham is already making it
difficult for Collins to supplant him. Graham is in great shape and
seems mentally prepared for a long battle.
</P>
<P>
   _ The new Green Bay coach, Ray Rhodes, has made believers of his
players. His legendary intensity is considered a positive. Rhodes
simply needs to make sure his intensity does not eventually wear on
the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   _ Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski recently signed a seven-year
deal that will pay him $32.2 million. The chances of his completing
that contract are slim because he will be 39 when it expires in
2005. &QL;

BRETT, YOUNT AND RYAN BRING BIG NUMBERS TO COOPERSTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Wis., Texas)  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the meter rolls from 2,999 to 3,000, it's a ``magic
change,'' said a man who has experienced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like walking on the moon,'' George Brett said. ``It's the
most monumental hit you'll ever get in your career.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks apart in September 1992, Brett and Robin Yount
joined the magic circle, becoming the 17th and 18th players to
reach 3,000 hits, and on Sunday they will take another joint step,
going into the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., as players
elected in their first year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Brett and Yount played one more season, retiring after the 1993
season, Brett with 3,154 hits, Yount with 3,142. Nolan Ryan retired
with them. He had given up 3,923 hits. But he also had amassed
5,714 strikeouts, one of his 48 major league records.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1936, the first year that elections for the Hall were
held, had three players gained entrance in their first year on the
ballot. These three are not strangers to each other. Ryan, in fact,
struck out Brett 18 times and Yount 16. But they were never victims
of any of his record seven no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan played so long, retiring when he was 46, that he struck out
seven sets of fathers and sons, including the Griffeys, the
Bondses, the McRaes, the Franconas and the Alomars, all three of
them. He also struck out 12 sets of brothers, including the Bretts,
the Ripkens, the Niekros and all three Alous.
</P>
<P>
   Brett and Yount were only two of 12 players Ryan struck out who
went on to get their 3,000th hit. That means he missed only nine of
the players who reached 3,000 career hits. Cap Anson was just a
little before his time. But Ryan will soon have struck out 15,
because as Brett and Yount enter the Hall, Wade Boggs and Tony
Gwynn approach 3,000 and Cal Ripken is not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's by far the greatest achievement I ever had,'' Brett said.
``It's just a mystical, magical moment that happens in someone's
life. It's hard to explain why one hit means so much. The 3,001st
hit is not nearly as exciting as the 3,000th.''
</P>
<P>
   His playoff home run against Rich Gossage that sent the Kansas
City Royals to the 1980 World Series was exciting, Brett said,
``but that doesn't put you in an elite club with some of the
greatest players who played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   During the winter following their entry into that club, Brett
recalled, he and Yount were invited to a dinner with other members
of the 3,000-hit club during a lavish memorabilia show in Atlantic
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they welcomed Robin and me was far greater than I
could have expected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame isn't as exclusive, but it is the pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one common factor besides their talent was they both
played the game hard. They played it the right way,'' Mike
Hargrove, the Cleveland Indians' manager, said of Brett and Yount.
``I think you need something other than your talent to make the
Hall of Fame, and Robin and George had it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove was a rookie with Texas in 1974, when Brett was a
rookie with the Royals and Yount was a rookie with the Milwaukee
Brewers. He remembers noticing Brett sooner than Yount, but it was
Ryan, a veteran by then, who made the most indelible impression on
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rookie year,'' Hargrove said, ``I tried to bunt against
Nolan and the next two pitches were right at my chest. I thought I
was dead. That convinced me never to try to bunt off Nolan Ryan
again, and I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove, whom Ryan struck out nine times, also recalled that
Ryan did not have time for nonsense when he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan was the ultimate competitor,'' the former first baseman
said. ``He really focused in on what he was doing. Nothing was ever
funny to Nolan when he pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove recalled that Ryan had a habit of checking the grass
and dirt in front of the mound before throwing his warm-up pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys on the Rangers knew he did that,'' Hargrove said,
``and one day in Texas, Clyde Wright took a bunch of plastic
spiders and snakes and salted the area around the mound with them.
Nolan came out and looked around and saw these things. I thought it
was funny. So did Clyde. Nolan didn't think it was funny at all. He
looked over at our bench and looked at Clyde, and Clyde was dying
laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was serious enough to gain 324 victories, tying him for
12th on the career list. But his 292 losses are third most and his
2,795 walks are the most in history.
</P>
<P>
   Brett finished with a .305 batting average, and Yount .285.
Yount, who began his major league career at age 18, was the
third-youngest player to reach 3,000 hits.

CALIFORNIA: COAST DEMOCRATS CLASH  
 QUAYLE HUMOR  
 CAMPAIGN 2000  
 MISSISSIPPI: L'AFFAIRE FORDICE

   California Democrats Duel With Democrats
</P>
<P>
   California Democrats came out of last fall's elections in the
best political shape in decades, capturing the governor's office
for the first time in 16 years and winning the race for lieutenant
governor, as well as winning solid control of both houses of the
state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes rose for speedy action on the party's governing agenda,
much of it in legislative limbo for years because of standoffs
between Republican governors and Democratic legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But except for passage of a tough assault weapons ban and a few
education reforms and environmental measures, there is little
action. Instead, Democrats are squabbling with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Democratic majorities in the legislature,
Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles and Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton of San Francisco, are liberal,
aggressive, outspoken legislators. They are pressing hard for speed
on such high-cost items as health care changes and workers'
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   But the new governor, Gray Davis, is a cautious, almost dour
centrist with strong ties to California's business community. He
wants to move slowly and, by all means, husband the state's money
and avoid new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In June he vetoed sections of several health and education
measures that Democrats had pushed to passage, saying they were too
costly and the product of undisciplined legislating.
</P>
<P>
   Then 10 days ago, without taking the usual precaution of
notifying Villaraigosa and Burton, Davis began contacting committee
chairmen and legislation authors directly to discuss action he
wanted or did not want.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, infuriated, called the end run ``a totally improper
intrusion in the legislative process.''
</P>
<P>
   Villaraigosa declared, ``We are not going to allow the
legislative process to be dictated by executive department heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who is already out raising money for a re-election
bid, says voters gave him a clear mandate to govern last fall when
he won by 20 points. He vows not to back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a totally different view of the world than I do,''
he said of Burton and Villaraigosa in an interview on Tuesday with
The San Francisco Chronicle. ``It was my vision that commanded a
20-point victory, the largest victory in 40 years. Their job is to
implement my vision.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Burton countered:
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have an absolutely different view. I believe in checks
and balances.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle Deploys His Sense of Humor
</P>
<P>
   It's a more laid-back Dan Quayle chasing the Republican
nomination this time around. The eyes that once had a startled glow
that resembled, as it was often said, those of a deer caught in
headlights, now have a soft twinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, in an appearance on ``The Tonight Show,'' Quayle
held up a name card that he said had come from the door of his
studio dressing room. His name was spelled QUAYL.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no E,'' the former vice president told the show's
host, Jay Leno. ``There's always an E on Quayle. There's an E on
every word. Right?'
</P>
<P>
   As in potatoe.
</P>
<P>
   And self-depreciatione.
</P>
<P>
   Will it help?
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie Gobel, the director of the Christian Coalition in Iowa,
has her doubts. She says that there are far too many Republicans
running and that some should drop out, especially some of the
hard-right conservatives who are competing for the Christian right
vote. If more than one or two of the ``godly'' candidates stay in,
she argues, the rather sizable and influential Christian vote could
be splintered into a meaningless mess.
</P>
<P>
   So the other day, said The Arizona Republic, Ms. Gobel raised
the issue with Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him,'' she told the paper, ``that we had too many
candidates. With the buffoon thing, did he think he could wiggle
out of it?''
</P>
<P>
   His reply, as relayed by Ms. Gobel:
</P>
<P>
   ``If God is in this, I will be the next president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   No Issue Dominates The 2000 Campaign
</P>
<P>
   In the 1992 presidential election, a struggling national economy
was the big issue, as summed up by that year's Democratic catch
phrase, ``It's the economy, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the big issue was still the economy _ an economy
rolling along so well that President Clinton was able to coast to
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the big issue for Election 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Not the economy, says the Pew Research Center for the People and
the Press. According to a new poll conducted by the nonpartisan
study group, based in Washington, the economy is now rolling along
so merrily that it ranks No. 11 with voters as a pressing political
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The current most worrisome issue is health care, the poll found,
followed, in order, by Social Security, Medicare, education, taxes,
the national debt, crime, gun control, foreign policy, national
morality, the economy and, finally, welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   But as Pew Center director Andrew Kohut sees it, none of those
issues is likely to dominate the 2000 campaign as the economy
dominated the 1992 and 1996 campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``None are so overriding,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Road Signs Figure In L'Affaire Fordice
</P>
<P>
   In our last installment of the Fordice Saga, Kirk, the governor
of Mississippi, and Pat, his wife of 44 years, were at a marital
impasse.
</P>
<P>
   After a weeklong liaison in France with an old high school
sweetheart, the Republican governor was back home in Jackson,
pressing for a divorce, threatening to thrash nosy reporters and
insisting there was no parallel between his extramarital behavior
and that of President Clinton, whose resignation he repeatedly
demanded during the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Fordice, for her part, was hanging tough, refusing to decamp
from the Executive Mansion and saying that while the governor might
want her gone, she did not view their marriage as ``some sort of
romantic comedy'' and would fight to salvage it.
</P>
<P>
   Then she apologized ``for being a partner in a marriage that has
become a source of embarrassment for Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   Now today's installment, in which we learn just how deep that
embarrassment runs for some Mississippians. . .
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, at a cost of $1,200, Republican leaders in
Vicksburg erected two signs at the city's limits that proudly
informed drivers they were entering the ``home of Governor Kirk
Fordice.'' But a few days ago, the city ordered the signs removed,
with several officials explaining that in light of the governor's
marital problems, the proud message the signs once sent had become
garbled.
</P>
<P>
   One sign had been spray-painted with the word ``hypocrite.'' The
other had been bashed to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   A city alderman, Sam Habeeb, a Republican, said that while he
belonged to the same political party as the governor, he
nevertheless favored removal of the signs ``to remove the mixed or
ambiguous messages that are out there about marital loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   An alderwoman, Gertrude Young, a Democrat, said City Hall had
received a number of complaints about the signs after word got out
about the Governor's trip to France. Anyway, she noted, the
governor no longer owns a home in Vicksburg.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's spokesman, Robbie Wilbur, urged Mississippians to
consider ``the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of Vicksburg and the state of Mississippi,'' he said,
``are better off since the Fordice administration took office.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.

A MONEY MACHINE LIKE SARATOGA CAN RUN ON GOOD, AGED WOOD

Tom Durkin is the track announcer for the New York Racing
Association.

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With 25,000 people expected to show up for
Wednesday's opening of America's most popular, most successful and
arguably most beautiful race track, it's hard to believe that
Saratoga's viability was ever questioned.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1950s, when newness and bigness reigned and plastic
was king, Saratoga Race Course, with its intimate wood-beamed
grandstand and authentic Victorian ambience, did not enjoy the
overwhelming success it has today.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower-era Saratoga did not hold the widespread democratic
appeal that it now relishes in the retro-starved '90s.
Society-minded Saratoga has always attracted the ``right'' people,
but in the '50s it did not attract a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, downstate in Queens they were building a brand new
race track of glass and steel. Aqueduct was going to be a big track
for big crowds just a short ride away on the A train. Promotional
material would boast of 35,000 cubic yards of concrete work and
8,500 tons of structural steel framing. The Big A was the
architectural antithesis of Saratoga. It would have elevators,
escalators, air-conditioning and no trees in the infield to block
your view. You wouldn't even have to leave your seat to watch the
horses in the new state-of-the-art paddock. The Big A would mean
king-size comfort. So very '50s.
</P>
<P>
   The Big A would also mean big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   In its inaugural season in 1959, Aqueduct averaged 28,006 fans a
day. That same year at Saratoga, the crowds averaged 13,729. And
the folks in Queens were players, punching $96 per capita through
the machines. The upstate crowd managed $77 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue collectors in Albany would cast covetous eyes on the
receipts from Aqueduct. At the same time, $50 million annually
realized in taxes from racing was a palpable part of state income.
For some, the temptation was surely there to race those prime
Saratoga dates in Queens County. That was, in fact, what the
operators of Saratoga did.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s it was the custom of the Saratoga Association
to run several weeks of their state-allocated dates at the Jamaica
Race Track on Baisley Boulevard in Queens. It was a far more
profitable site and the money made at Jamaica helped to subsidize
the purses and operating expenses of the exclusive Saratoga
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, the 18 days of ``Saratoga at Jamaica'' averaged 23,000
fans with $1.8 million in handle. The 24 days of ``Saratoga at
Saratoga'' averaged 14,600 fans and $960,000 in handle.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gilcoyne, the historian of the National Museum of Racing,
recalls the popular old Jamaica. ``Foot-Sore Downs is what many New
Yorkers called it because it drew big crowds and most people had to
stand,'' Gilcoyne said. ``It was a functional track with no attempt
at grandeur and niceties. It's an overused term, but Jamaica was a
blue-collar track. It was not Ascot.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Saratoga either, where in August you would find more
blue bloods than blue collars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Jamaica was purchased by a newly formed nonprofit
corporation that would become the New York Racing Association. The
NYRA would eventually sell Jamaica (it is now a housing project)
and rebuild the decaying Aqueduct and Belmont facilities. Saratoga
would remain in its fairly-well-kept Victorian state.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga was a treasured asset to all racing enthusiasts because
of its history and tradition, high-class racing, grand social
atmosphere and ambience. But the accountants and revenue collectors
probably didn't care much about quaintness. Gilcoyne recalls the
situation: ``Saratoga couldn't compete financially with the New
York City tracks. There was an undercurrent of feeling at the time
that it would not last. The place was a little stale and there was
a foreboding that Saratoga was a terminal case.''
</P>
<P>
   So, a racing enthusiast, the owner of Log Cabin Stud, Gov. W.
Averell Harriman, led a pre-emptive attack before any meaningful
aggression on Saratoga could be mounted. The so-called Harriman Act
of 1957 was unprecedented. It mandated that a minimum of 24 racing
dates be run every year at Saratoga. A 100-year tradition of August
racing at the Spa would remain. It was the law.
</P>
<P>
   Harriman may have never envisioned the overflow crowds that are
drawn to the old course on Union Avenue now. Last year there was an
average of 24,660 a day. And with simulcasting the mutuel handle is
going through the slate roof: $13,348,310, a North American record.
</P>
<P>
   The only fear Saratoga lovers have now is that it will weaken
under the weight of its own success. Over the last 10 years, the
season has grown from 24 to 36 days. In a role reversal of the
1950s, it is taking dates away from the downstate tracks. The
36-day meeting has caused worries about diluting the quality of the
product. But business is better than ever; in fact, the financial
numbers are so impressive that NYRA officials will spend a good
deal of their time there this August squelching rumors about a
48-day meeting. How times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers attribute Saratoga's unbridled prosperity in
recent times to a combination of factors: easier interstate access
via the Northway, an energetic promotional campaign, tasteful and
appropriate physical improvements and the continuity of quality
racing.
</P>
<P>
   But the downstate tracks, Belmont and Aqueduct, are also
accessible, promoted and improved, and the racing itself remains
some of the best in the country even though the product has never
been quite as elite as Saratoga's.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason for Saratoga's current success seems to be a
change in the esthetic zeitgeist of the sports crowd. Saratoga
survived the '50s when places like Ebbets Field and the Polo
Grounds didn't. Two of baseball's '50s survivors and among its most
successful stadiums are the genuine, cozy and quirky Fenway Park
and Wrigley Field. And when genuine, cozy and quirky wasn't
available in Baltimore and Cleveland, they just manufactured it.
They play to big crowds in all four cities no matter how poor the
team's record is.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga is the real 19th-century item. Its grandstand of creaky
wood beams with its multisteepled slate roof dates to 1892. The
horses still inefficiently make their way from stables across Union
Avenue, stopping traffic, then cautiously wind through the backyard
crowds to be saddled under the trees, much as they did when Ulysses
S. Grant lived nearby.
</P>
<P>
   View obstruction was never an obsession at Saratoga. Large,
leafy maples continue to flourish in the infield, making for a
sylvan scene, but careful observation of the races is a challenge.
Just ask the track announcer.
</P>
<P>
   Odds are good that more people will pass through the turnstiles
this year than any other year since it opened in 1864. The place,
no doubt, feels much the same as it did when the Harriman Act was
signed back in the '50s. But in the '90s, we just feel it
differently. &QL;

AIRPORT INCIDENT RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT `AIR RAGE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A violent incident at Newark, N.J., International Airport that
left a Continental Airlines gate agent near death and a passenger
under arrest has led to a wave of protest among airline workers who
say they have been increasingly targeted by aggravated, aggressive
passengers in the phenomenon known as ``air rage.''
</P>
<P>
   The gate agent, Angelo Sottile, 50, of Kearny, N.J., suffered
fractured spinal vertebrae and head injuries on Thursday night when
a passenger who tried to enter a jetway without a boarding pass
became enraged, picked the agent up and hurled him head-down onto
the floor, Port Authority police said.
</P>
<P>
   While the passenger, John Davis, 29, of Fredericksburg, Va., was
arrested and charged with aggravated assault, and Continental's
management met with employees twice on Friday to discuss security,
many of Continental's 11,000 Newark workers remain uneasy over
dangers posed by belligerent and sometimes drunken passengers
angered by flight delays, cancellations and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's attitudes have changed,'' Timothy Peterson, 34, who
has been a Continental baggage handler for five years, said
Saturday at Newark's Terminal C, where the confrontation occurred.
``They are aggravated with long lines and flight delays. They're
becoming more aggressive. People lash out, scream at ticket agents.
I'm concerned for my personal safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Continental officials insisted Saturday that security for its
49,300 employees across the nation was of paramount concern, and
that attacks by unruly passengers would not be tolerated. ``We will
not stand for any violence against our employees,'' said Catherine
Stengel, an airline spokeswoman. ``The safety of our employees is
very important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stengel noted that Continental, like other airlines,
provided security at the airport, along with the Port Authority
police, but she acknowledged that the security was not specifically
focused on the protection of employees, and she declined to discuss
the adequacy of the security.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Bethune, chairman and chief executive of Continental, the
nation's fifth largest airline, noted in a message to employees on
Friday that Sottile had been grievously injured and pledged to
protect workers and to prosecute anyone who assaults them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really sad when things like that happen, and we're going
to make sure, to the full extent of the law, that the customer who
took that action against one of our employees is prosecuted,''
Bethune said. ``We love our customers, but that means they have to
respect our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority police said that Sottile was working in Terminal
C at Gate 115 on Thursday night, preparing to board passengers for
a flight to Orlando when, at about 9:10 p.m., a toddler ran from
his parents in the waiting area into the jetway leading to the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The child's mother, accompanied by a Continental gate agent,
went into the jetway in pursuit. The child's father, identified as
Davis, also tried to enter the jetway, but he was barred by Sottile
because he had no boarding pass _ his family had not yet picked
them up from the ticket agent at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the police report said, became enraged at Sottile, picked
him up in a bear-hug, turned him upside down and hurled him,
head-first, onto the floor. Sottile suffered several fractures of
the spine and neck, as well as head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Davis walked away, but was seized nearby by Port Authority
officers, who handcuffed him. Meanwhile, an ambulance was called,
and Sottile was taken to University Hospital in Newark, where he
was listed in critical but stable condition Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was charged with aggravated assault and, after an
arraignment in Essex County Court, was held at the Essex County
Jail in $50,000 bail. He was released Saturday after posting bail,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Upset by the incident, Continental employees at Newark _ many of
whom are unionized, though not the gate agents _ demanded meetings
with the airline's management on Friday. Continental officials were
said to have offered assurances of protection.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over air rage, especially by airline employees, has been
growing in the skies and at airports around the world in recent
years as the number of flights and passengers has grown
dramatically, and with them the tensions often associated with
delays, cancellations, long lines, lost baggage and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   News media reports have featured numerous accounts of what
appears to be an alarming trend of angry passengers who punch,
kick, scratch, bite and head-butt airline employees or even one
another. Some airlines and unions representing pilots and flight
attendants have urged federal authorities to more aggressively
prosecute unruly, abusive passengers, and have called for heavy
fines and prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But the extent of the problem is difficult to measure. While
airlines carry more than 600 million passengers annually in the
United States alone, federal aviation officials have recorded only
about 200 incidents in which passengers interfere with flight crews
_ one incident for every 3 million passengers. In addition, short
of an outright assault or other clear-cut case, it is not always
clear what constitutes unruly behavior.
</P>
<P>
   No statistics are kept for such incidents at Newark Airport,
either by Port Authority police or by individual airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But Continental employees at Newark _ with 384 flights a day,
one of the airline's major hubs along with Houston and Cleveland _
are nonetheless uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airline needs to cut down on delays,'' said Peterson, the
baggage handler. ``People are told to come an hour early, and
sometimes that's still not enough time. Sometimes flights are
missed because of long lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Perez, 27, another baggage handler, said: ``There have been
more problems this summer. There's been a big summer rush here. I'm
concerned that if it can happen to this man, it can happen to me.
The only thing I can see doing is to get more security at the
terminal.''

LOCAL MERCHANTS' HOPES FOR WOODSTOCK '99 WINDFALL ARE DASHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ More than 100 miles east of the exit leading to the
Woodstock '99 festival, concert-bound travelers crowded the
Starbucks counter at a rest stop on the New York State Thruway on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But on James Street in Rome, a commercial strip only two blocks
away from a major entrance to the festival, the impact on business
was barely apparent.
</P>
<P>
   George Manley's decision to keep his store open around the clock
for the duration of the concert had yielded little more than a
chance to sit out front with friends and drink beer.
</P>
<P>
   Manley, who owns a pawn and junk store called the Bargain Shop,
had stocked up on the things every concertgoer needs, and it was
priced to sell _ mini-grills for $2, serviceable bicycles for $35,
flip-flops for a couple of bucks. But apart from a few bikes and a
fair amount of candy, the merchandise was not moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been slow,'' he said. ``I think we all expected to do a
lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Some stores are doing well. At the Mohawk Acres Shopping Center,
which is practically on top of the main entrance, the Price Chopper
supermarket was packing them in, as were the Family Dollar store
and the Burger King. But for most shopkeepers in Rome, the dream of
a festival windfall seems to be fading.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the problem is that most of the potential customers are
fenced in at the former Air Force base where the concert is going
on.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the attendees, after shelling out $5 for a beer or a
bottle of water, or $17 for a 25-pound bag of ice, do not even have
enough money to get home, let alone go shopping. Manley has been
doing as much buying as selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have to survive,'' he said. ``I bought some gold
chains. One girl sold her mother's gold ring just so she could get
back to Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning at Manley's store, the cashier, Diana DeMorrow,
said a couple of girls from Ohio came by hoping to sell a
television, some inline skates and a car stereo in order to buy an
extra ticket, which costs $150, and to get gas money to go home.
She turned them away, she said, because she did not know if the
merchandise was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tomorrow and Monday it's going to be the worst,'' she
said. ``Some of these people are starving already. They're eating
raw hot dogs because they can't afford the food up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Up the street, at the New Yorker restaurant, the owner, Carol
Morrill, was having similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the city would do better, but I really don't see any
difference,'' she said. ``The kids who come by here, they have no
money. They're looking for deals.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said the festival had scared business away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt a little bit,'' she said. ``A lot of the Romans who
normally come out, my regular customers, came by last week and said
`I'll see you in two weeks, I'm going to spend the next two weeks
indoors.' They're staying close to home because they're afraid of
looters. They figure there's a lot of kids out there with no money
and no way to go home.'' Many of Ms. Morrill's other regulars have
simply left town for the duration, she said, rather than deal with
the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Rome's fear of marauding tribes of tie-dyed Visigoths has proved
unfounded. Police reported Saturday morning that they had made 15
arrests so far, most of them for minor offenses, such as disorderly
conduct. Violent crime had amounted to one robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Manley remained hopeful that business would pick up. ``After
midnight,'' he said Friday night, ``people are going to come. After
the music ends they're not going to want to be cooped up in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But midnight came and went, and while some concertgoers trickled
out and down the street, most didn't stop at his store.
</P>
<P>
   A little after midnight, two men pulled up in a car. The
longer-haired one went over to look at a bike and accidentally
knocked it over onto an aquarium tank, which shattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK '' Manley said.
</P>
<P>
   After browsing guiltily for about 15 minutes, the long-haired
man, Bob Rising of Mansfield, Ohio, bought a tube of
bug-repellent-cum-sunblock for $2.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about some Tylenol?'' Manley pitched hopefully. ``You here
for the weekend? You'll get some headaches. Tylenol, the big box,
three bucks a how-de-do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No thanks,'' Rising said. ``We don't do drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing people seemed willing to spend money on was
Woodstock-related merchandise. Across the street from the New
Yorker, a sports apparel store, Erin's Way, had given its floor
space over to Woodstock caps, Woodstock dog tags and most of all,
T-shirts, including a popular one that read ``All Roads Lead to
Rome'' and showed four horses pulling a coach containing a bird
playing a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owner drove down to Saugerties,'' more than two hours
away, to get them, said the cashier, Roxanne May, adding that when
she told customers he might not be back for another half hour, they
waited. ``Just for a T-shirt. It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Further down James Street, a ``Welcome Woodstock Fans'' banner
hung outside Midnight Mikey's tavern, but at 1 a.m., an hour after
Bush closed out the first night's music, the only Woodstock fans in
evidence were on the TV behind the bar.
</P>
<P>
   There were about 10 customers. Behind the bar, the proprietor,
Mike Vescio, said that all in all, it had been a pretty slow Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they didn't have that thing it would have been a lot
busier,'' he said. ``Some of my regulars are up at the concert.''
</P>
<P>
   Vescio said that he had been surprised by the low turnout at his
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy from Oneonta came in here a couple of days ago, he goes
to these kinds of shows, and he said `Man, you're gonna be
jammed,''' Vescio said. ``Everybody thought with all these cars
coming through that people would jump out of the cars and buy
stuff.'' But the cars just keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Up the road, Vescio's daughter, Michele Vescio, had temporarily
changed the name of her bar, the Stockyard Inn, to the Woodstock
Inn. But not even that seemed to help. Nor did being across the
street from a Denny's that was jammed at 2 a.m. Saturday morning.
After three straight dead nights, Ms. Vescio decided to throw in
the towel.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, she said, rather than run a bar, she and her staff
were going to the show. ``If it's not worth our while to stay
open,'' she said, ``we might as well go up there.''

<P>
   With the jobs of 26 of the 68 umpires already safe, a baseball
official held out the possibility Saturday that more umpires could
salvage their jobs in coming days if they rescind their
resignations.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball has taken no public stance on the umpires'
job action, in which about 80 percent of them signed letters of
resignation, and Saturday it continued to maintain official
silence. However, league officials Friday notified umpires who had
revoked their letters that they would be able to continue to work.
</P>
<P>
   One official indicated at that time that the 42 umpires who had
not acted to rescind would have their resignations accepted.
However, when another official was asked Saturday what might happen
if umpires rescinded in coming days, he said, ``It's open to
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say, but it was possible the judgment would be based
on the umpire's record. If is an umpire his league believes to be
one of the better ones, he could be retained. If, on the other
hand, he is one who has received a low rating and the league had
been thinking of replacing him anyway, his withdrawal could be
denied and his resignation accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on the condition he not be identified,
said word has circulated that more umpires are expected to revoke
their resignations, but he had no indication of how many might take
that step.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires' support of the resignation plan, devised by union
leader Richie Phillips, has been mixed along league lines. Thirty
of the American League's 32 umpires are union members, and 21 have
either not signed letters or have rescinded them. In the National
League, only one of the 36 umpires has not signed, and two have
rescinded, leaving 33 whose jobs are in jeopardy.

PACERS AND HAWKS WANT TO BE KNICKISH  
 REUNION IN L.A.?  
 SPURS EYE BURRELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby, the explosive and
fleet-footed Knicks, are still on the minds of the Indiana Pacers
and the Atlanta Hawks. Having been victimized by the new-look
Knicks in the Eastern Conference playoffs, two of the league's more
renowned plodders are looking to become more athletic, more
versatile, more Knickish.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Camby fly as if he had wings in stripping
Indiana's frontline of its brutish reputation, Donnie Walsh, the
Pacers' president, is focused on adding youth and gracefulness to
his lineup. And after Sprewell turned the Knicks' four-game sweep
of Atlanta into a track meet highlighted by fierce dunks and
scowls, Pete Babcock, the Hawks' general manager, is set to revamp
his entire starting group _ save center Dikembe Mutombo _ if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the season progressed, we became aware that our team speed
and quickness wasn't what we would like it to be,'' Babcock said.
``Then, to run into the Knicks, who had terrific athletic ability
and team speed, just accentuated what we already knew and drove the
point further home. So we want to try to restructure our team so
that we have better athletic ability top to bottom, and anything we
can do along those lines, we are committed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks took their initial step in that direction by trading
Mookie Blaylock, the aging point guard at 32, to Golden State for
Bimbo Coles and the 10th pick of the draft, which they used to
select the Arizona point guard Jason Terry. In his first appearance
as a Hawk, Terry, incredibly quick and a solid outside shooter,
scorched Charlotte's Baron Davis, the third pick in the draft, for
30 points in a summer league game.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, in what would be one of the biggest trades
of the off- season, Atlanta is looking into sending Steve Smith to
Portland for Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson. That Babcock, who in the
past has insisted on his players displaying character on and off
the court, is considering the acquisition of Rider, a noted
malcontent whose tardiness and goofiness has worn thin in Portland,
shows how serious the Hawks are about escaping their pattern of
mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta chooses to overlook Rider's past, it will be at least
partly because he has just one year remaining on his contract. The
Hawks are looking to free room beneath the salary cap, and Smith is
under contract through the 2002-2003 season.
</P>
<P>
   While some believe that a makeover is also in order in Indiana,
Walsh said his team has at least one more run at the conference
title left in it. ``I would love for you guys to write us off,''
Walsh said. ``We still have a lot of good basketball players. I
wouldn't just automatically say that since we lost to the Knicks,
we're out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Walsh is trying to build a youthful second unit
that could match strides with the Knicks. He believes he has five
athletic and multidimensional substitutes in Jalen Rose, who may
displace Chris Mullin as the starting small forward; Travis Best;
Al Harrington; and the first-round draft picks Jeff Foster and
Jonathon Bender, this year's prep-to-pros phenom.
</P>
<P>
   With his slower, more cerebral veterans still dominating the
starting five, Walsh envisions a two-headed club that could thrive
in a halfcourt battle or fullcourt sprint. There is, however, one
scenario that could quicken the process and make the Pacers' first
unit more blazing. Rik Smits, the 7-foot-4-inch center with chronic
foot problems, indicated at the end of the conference finals that
he would retire this summer, even though it would mean forfeiting
the $12 million he is due to receive next season. It is believed
that Smits will give an answer by early next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure he'll be back,'' Walsh said. ``I think it was
overstated that he was definitely retiring. I met with him the day
that the story came out and he told me that it was incorrect. He
said he'd see how he felt and that if his feet felt OK, he'd play.
If they didn't, he'd let me know.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his case, it would kind of be like Patrick Ewing is with
the Knicks. There is no way we're going to go out and replace him
in the short term, and if he isn't able to play, we'll play a much
faster style. But we're headed in that direction already.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, in what would seem to be a bizarre move since they already
have Reggie Miller, the Pacers are rumored to be interested in
signing the shooting guard Mitch Richmond through free agency.
Walsh said the theory should not be discounted and brought up the
Knicks as the reason why. ``Who would have thought that Latrell
Sprewell would make sense for the Knicks when they already had
Allan Houston?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway to the Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in The Los Angeles Times last week, the
Lakers are exploring the possibility of reuniting the former
Orlando Magic teammates Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway.
Hardaway, who along with O'Neal led the Magic to the National
Basketball Association finals in 1995, is supposedly the driving
force behind the idea. According to the report, the Lakers would
send Glen Rice and Derek Fisher to Orlando in a sign-and-trade
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But while Hardaway and O'Neal are said to have put their
much-publicized problems of the past behind them, a person with
knowledge of the situation said the Lakers are leery of bringing in
Hardaway, who has become known as a prima donna because of run-ins
with the coaches Brian Hill and Chuck Daly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penny would love to be there,'' said the person, an agent who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``The Lakers are looking at
it, but I'm not certain that that's their No. 1 choice. It would
give them an interesting combination of talent, but there's a real
concern about Penny's attitude. The feeling is that he may be more
of a destructive than a constructive personality to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Lakers would probably rather deal with Hardaway
than with Rice, who has been unhappy for most of his brief stint
with the club. The situation recently surpassed the point of
toleration when the Lakers decided to pick up Rice's $7 million
option for next season. Rice, who wanted to renegotiate to the tune
of roughly $14 million per year, was incensed. For that reason, it
is almost a certainty that Rice will be traded, whether it is for
Hardaway or someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of a West Coast reunion between Scottie Pippen and Phil
Jackson will probably amount to nothing more because the Lakers
have concerns about Pippen's back. Pippen, a veteran of 12 seasons,
is worn down for his age (33), having played in 182 career playoff
games, which amounts to nearly three full seasons. The Lakers think
his struggles last season in Houston were partly caused by his back
problems.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' Plan B
</P>
<P>
   With its starting small forward, Sean Elliott, in need of a
kidney transplant, the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs are looking
for possible replacements, one of whom is the Nets' free agent
Scott Burrell. The Spurs have been in contact with Burrell for the
last week and are believed to be willing to pay him the $2 million
midlevel exception.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell, a member of the Chicago Bulls' 1998 title team, is
coming off a disappointing season with the Nets. Admittedly out of
shape for much of the year, he averaged just 6.6 points and 3.7
rebounds on 36 percent shooting. He missed 18 games and underwent
minor surgery on his right knee in April.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets were so displeased with Burrell's play that they have
offered him only a one-year, $1 million contract to return.
Burrell, who says that the former coach John Calipari promised him
he would receive $2 million this season, wants to return to the
Nets, but not for such a small sum.

APPRAISERS: THE ART OF GETTING TO THE BOTTOM LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is an innocuous-looking packet of papers, or, these days, an
e-mail _ several pages evaluating the ``subject residence,'' floor
plans, photos of ``comparables'' and a dollar figure _ that can
make or break a deal: the appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Halstead, founder of the Manhattan brokerage that bears
his name and himself a former appraiser, likens the appraisal to
the Oracle at Delphi, ``where kings and commoners sat around a hole
in the stone until black or white smoke came out _ black smoke
means the deal's in trouble, white smoke means clean and green
straight ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   For the appraisal industry itself, however, the road has been
rough in recent years _ buffeted as it was by regulatory reform
following the savings-and-loan crisis of the late '80s and then
radically reshaped by computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   The residential transaction can be stressful for all the
parties: buyers, sellers, brokers, even the lenders. ``And the
appraiser only adds to the stress,'' Halstead said.
``Unfortunately, the Oracle doesn't speak in this case until late
in the deal,'' often not much before the closing.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer always worries whether the price is too high. ``And if
the appraisal is below the contract price,'' Halstead said, ``he is
consumed by buyer's remorse and tries to renegotiate, or walks
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The seller thinks the deal is done, and envisions closing on
that next dream house. ``So when the appraisal comes in low, he is
traumatized, not prepared to renegotiate,'' Halstead said, ``and
feels badly served by that fickle buyer.''
</P>
<P>
   The broker, having already mentally deposited the commission,
has to scramble. ``The broker has two courses,'' Halstead said,
``get the old appraiser to consider new comparables or convince the
parties to use another appraiser.''
</P>
<P>
   And another player in the drama, the mortgage broker, under
pressure to meet quarterly lending goals, has visions of bonuses
dancing out of his head. ``Lenders actually refer to mortgage loans
as sales: `How are your sales going?' the boss wants to know,''
Halstead said. ``Everybody's hanging on this. That's why it's like
the Oracle. If you get white smoke, it's party time.''
</P>
<P>
   A white puff rose over 18 Bertha Lane in Massapequa Park, N.Y.,
on Long Island, in April when Richard Meyer, president of Meyer
Associates, an appraisal company in nearby Bellmore, submitted his
valuation for the four-bedroom expanded Cape.
</P>
<P>
   The agreed-upon price for the house, with its new kitchen,
finished basement and a rear deck, was $238,000. The appraisal
price: a nearly on-the-money $242,500.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom in downtown
Manhattan that, because of an architectural quirk, opened onto a
2,000-square-foot terrace. ``People get emotional about outdoor
space,'' said Jeffrey Jackson Satkiewicz, chairman of the appraisal
firm Mitchell, Maxwell &AMP; Jackson. ``And when a property is unique,
like that, there's nothing to compare it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Black smoke rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contract price was $1 million,'' Satkiewicz said. ``We
appraised it at $750,000. The buyer tried to renegotiate. The
seller wouldn't budge. So the buyer walked away. This was six weeks
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago,'' Satkiewicz said, ``the same buyer came
through purchasing another property; about the same size inside,
but the terrace was 1,000 feet rather than 2,000, and they were
paying $600,000. They were happy to have $400,000 more in their
pocket than to have the extra space.''
</P>
<P>
   The process is sometimes no picnic for the appraiser: tramping
through and nosing into other people's property, clipboard and tape
measure in hand; toting up square footage, noting the gas station
behind the back fence, the ancient oil heater; deducting for
defects and factoring in upgrades and amenities, like the finished
basement, the new kitchen, the fireplace, and, in more rarefied
environs, the racquetball court, the sumptuous landscaping, the
reflecting pool.
</P>
<P>
   There are hazards to the trade, Meyer said: ``Measuring houses
in the snow and falling into a basement window well. Being pulled
over by the police in exclusive neighborhoods _ we're taking
pictures and it looks like we're casing out a burglary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day,'' Meyer said, ``one of my appraisers was doing
a two-family in Brooklyn and he was attacked by the tenant. She was
being evicted because she hadn't paid rent and took it out on the
appraiser.''
</P>
<P>
   The '90s have been a tumultuous time for the industry. And in
the estimate of Bert Thornton, president of the 19,000-member
Appraisal Institute, a trade association, ``the profession has
changed more in the last five years than in the previous 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as nothing else, computers have streamlined and
standardized the process, rendering an array of data _ from
economic overviews and regional residential trends to specific
information on the most recent sale of ``comparables'' down the
block _ available, literally, at the push of a button. So, too, can
the final appraisal, complete with digital photographs, be e-mailed
to the client (usually, though not always, the lender) almost
instantaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Hand in hand with the computer revolution has been the ripple
effect on appraisers stirred by the globalization of money markets,
particularly given the allure of an enduringly vibrant U.S.
economy. ``There are no boundaries today,'' Thornton said, ``so you
have a lot of capital flowing in and out of the United States'' _
with investors from all over the world wanting a slice of the
American home-loan pie through what Wall Street calls
securitization. ``The loans are pooled,'' Thornton explained,
``rating agencies rate those pools of loans and they are
securitized, sold as shares.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in a market where capital for lending is
plentiful and mortgage rates have been low and steady, the computer
has made it possible for so-called subprime borrowers _ those with
less than exemplary credit histories _ to be granted mortgages
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The lender requires an appraisal on a property, and these days
that is probably the biggest condition for granting a mortgage,''
said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage
research company in Butler, N.J. ``In recent years, even folks with
poor credit have been able to obtain mortgages, albeit at higher
interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Computers have taken much of the subjectivity, and bias, out of
mortgage origination through what is called credit scoring _ the
strictly numerical calculation of a borrower's credit history and
capacity. That, in turn, expeditiously tells the lender what type
of mortgage it can offer. ``And that has lent itself to faster
pooling and easier securitization of the mortgages themselves,''
Gumbinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that virtually any borrower can get a mortgage,'' he said,
``the lender still needs to be reassured that the property has
value, and whether it is fairly valued against similar properties.
And, of course, that is the need for your appraisal.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the late '80s, forces other than the computer have
reshaped the appraisal process. In a kind of tectonic convulsion,
the industry was rocked by the nation's savings-and-loan debacle,
with government regulators laying part of the blame for that tidal
wave of irrational S&AMP;L lending on the ill-considered and sometimes
unethical performance of some appraisers. ``There are, as in any
profession, some unscrupulous appraisers,'' Thornton said.
</P>
<P>
   Dominick Pompeo is president of Diversified Valuation Group in
South Ozone Park, Queens, as well as a former chairman and current
member of the New York State Appraisal Board, the agency that
licenses appraisers. Congressional investigators found, Pompeo
said, ``that 50 percent of all losses by S&AMP;Ls were due to faulty or
fraudulent appraisals.''
</P>
<P>
   Either the appraised value was so high that it had no basis in
reality, Pompeo said, or the appraiser was simply unqualified.
Pompeo recalled how his office analyzed a lending institution's
portfolio and found that it had lent $2 million on a Manhattan
property it believed to be worth $4 million, ``based on an
appraisal by someone who was unqualified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the bank didn't know,'' Pompeo said, ``was that it was a
loft building, subject to the Loft Law, which restricts rents and
requires that the building be brought into residential code
compliance.'' The appraiser had forecast rents that were not
allowable and disregarded the cost of bringing the building into
compliance. The true value, he said, was $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of improprieties leading to the S&AMP;L crisis, a
lot of shady characters inflating values,'' said Jonathan Miller,
president of Miller Samuel, the company that produces the Douglas
Elliman Manhattan Market Report. ``Until then, it was an
unregulated profession that was not held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1989, in response to the S&AMP;L collapse, the government
enacted Title 11 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and
Enforcement Act, requiring that anyone appraising federally insured
properties be state licensed, and establishing minimum requirements
_ 2,000 hours of field experience (now 2,500), 120 hours of
classroom training and passage of a written test.
</P>
<P>
   The law also allowed states to choose mandatory or voluntary
licensing status: mandatory meaning all appraisers had to meet the
minimum requirements to perform federally related appraisals;
voluntary meaning only those doing Federal work need be licensed.
New York is a voluntary state _ a choice that has caused some
consternation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Federal Housing Administration shook up the
industry again. It discarded its list of 8,000 designated
appraisers, chosen by rotation to perform federally related
appraisals, and adopted a program called ``Lender-Select'' _
meaning the lender of any mortgage to be insured by the government
could choose any state-licensed appraiser. Problems arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lender has a fiduciary responsibility to FHA,'' said James
Park, a member of the Appraisal Institute's client services
committee and president of the JP Appraisal Service in Alexandria,
Va. But a General Accounting Office study, Park said, reported that
under Lender-Select the FHA insured many homes that did not meet
its requirements and, ``maybe more importantly, put people in the
unfortunate position of buying homes that had significant
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the buyers defaulted. ``FHA ends up holding the
property and has to pay insurance to the lender,'' Park said.
``They then have to sell the foreclosed property, many times at a
loss. And, ultimately, the American taxpayer bears the burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Pompeo of the New York State Appraisal Board is troubled by some
shifts in the industry. In the past, he said, banks hired
appraisers directly. Now, increasingly, they rely on mortgage
brokers to provide clients, so the broker selects the appraiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``No longer is the lender a disinterested party because his
remuneration depends on the mortgage being completed,'' Pompeo
said. ``If the broker is unscrupulous, and the property has
attributes that the bank and the buyer should be aware of,'' an
unethical broker ``would wish the appraiser to ignore it. And
people who are not adhering to appraisal standards are being
rewarded by work from brokers who want a predetermined result in
their appraisals.''
</P>
<P>
   One trend that pleases cost-conscious lenders, but troubles some
appraisers, is the ``drive-by appraisal'' _ usually employed in
suburban settings _ in which the appraiser assumes that the
interior of the house is typical of the market.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To address some of the problems, the Department of Housing and
Urban Development in June announced a Home Buyer Protection
Initiative, a program that, among other things, creates an
appraisal education program for consumers, mandates greater
specificity in identifying building deficiencies and requires that
the buyer receive a copy of the appraisal no less than five days
before closing.
</P>
<P>
   Although lenders constitute, by far, the majority of appraisal
clients, the buyer is entitled to a copy of the appraisal. And it
is usually the buyer who pays the appraiser's fee, as part of the
closing costs. Fees vary according to the complexity of the
property. So, for example, a half-hour perusal by Meyer of that
Cape in Massapequa Park might cost $250, while Satkiewicz's more
extensive inspection of a luxury Manhattan co-op could cost $1,000
or far more.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving at the property, the appraiser starts by
calculating dimensions _ using a tape measure or, perhaps, a sonar
device that, like a bat, bounces a signal from wall to wall, then
emits a disembodied voice intoning: ``Sixteen feet, four inches.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Miller said: ``We sketch a floor plan, assess the
condition of the floors, walls, ceilings, anything visible; and
take note of upgrades,'' like a new kitchen, ``and amenities,''
like the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Through multiple listing services, official records or, wherever
possible, actual visits, the appraiser collects information on
comparables. ``In the case of co-ops,'' Miller said, ``we get hold
of the current co-op financial statement; or, for houses, we're
going to town hall or the local MLS to look at recent transfers in
the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Then begins the actual valuation work _ a complicated and not
entirely scientific process depending largely on the appraiser's
knowledge of the community. ``Let's say you have two properties
that are identical in every respect except for one amenity, such as
the view,'' Miller said. ``In the case of an apartment, the subject
residence could have a direct view of Central Park above the tree
line, while the same apartment below the tree line might have sold
for 15 percent less.''
</P>
<P>
   In a typical suburban community, Meyer said, ``upgrades such as
new kitchens, a pool, the rear deck could increase values,
cumulatively, by 10 to 20 percent of the total value.''
</P>
<P>
   Upgrade by upgrade, amenity by amenity, the home under
examination and its comparables are factored in to arrive at an
estimate of market value. ``It's a mix of the appraiser's objective
and subjective experiences,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   One morning in June, Satkiewicz walked through a four-bedroom
condominium on the 31st floor of the Grand Millennium at Broadway
and 66th Street and was immediately struck by the terrace and its
wraparound view of Central Park, the spires of midtown Manhattan
and the Hudson River. ``It curves around, almost juts out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His sonar measuring device in hand, Satkiewicz calculated the
terrace at 197 square feet _ just one of a panoply of amenities he
would account for during his 90-minute tour of the apartment, but
one that, he said, ``gives it star quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Satkiewicz returned to his office to crunch numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five comparables on this appraisal,'' he said, ``and
they sold for between $976 and $1,129 per square foot.'' Using that
range, he chose $1,000 per square foot as his base for further
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We adjust for exterior space by comparing sales of identical
apartments that have exterior space to those without,'' he said,
``and isolate the value of the terrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that research and experience ``tell me that terraces are
worth half the square-foot price for inside the apartment,''
Satkiewicz valued the terrace at $500 per foot. He multiplied the
197 square feet of terrace by $500, for a preliminary figure of
$98,500 in added value to the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's just the scientific part,'' Satkiewicz said.
``There are things that are not quantifiable but need to be
factored in: one is what you see from the terrace; the second is
any improvement that enhances its utility, in this case, the terra
cotta tiles and the wiring for surround-sound stereo. In my
judgment, those add 50 percent to our base figure of $98,500,'' or
$147,750 in added value.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is just one factor in the equation. ``We go
through the process for each of the major upgrades and amenities,''
he said, ``and get an adjusted range of sales prices for all the
comparables.'' With the comparables taken into account, Satkiewicz
said, ``we select a value within the range that we think best
represents the subject's position in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   His appraisal of the apartment, which the current owner bought
for $2.3 million in January 1997: $3.51 million.

DEFYING GOP PRESSURE, LAZIO PUSHES AHEAD WITH SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showing no signs of backing off in his maverick bid for the
Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long
Island has sent a letter to Republican and Conservative Party
leaders across New York state, confirming that he will officially
declare his candidacy with a statewide tour in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's decision to set a date for his announcement seemed
intended as a response to pressure from some Republican leaders
that he step aside and allow New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
to take his party's nomination. The Republican candidate is likely
to face Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Democratic line in the
November 2000 election, and Republican leaders _ including
Giuliani's advisers _ have expressed concern about a primary. State
Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno called on Lazio to drop his
campaign last week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani is a better-known and presumably
better-financed candidate, Lazio is more conservative on some
issues _ like abortion rights _ that could be decisive in a
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to be one of the first to know that I have made my
decision _ I will be a candidate for U.S. Senate,'' Lazio wrote in
the letter to Republican and Conservative party leaders. ``I'm
going to make an official announcement on August 17th.'' The letter
was first reported Saturday in The New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Lazio said he had encountered signs of support
during his travels in New York. He also noted that he had raised
$3.2 million so far. An adviser said Saturday that Lazio was likely
to hire Mike Murphy, a prominent national Republican strategist who
worked for Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996, to help direct
his effort.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lazio did not mention Giuliani by name, though he made a clear
and unflattering reference to the mayor's long-term political
ambitions and commitment to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to me that New Yorkers want a senator who cares
about them and their problems, not someone who is interested in a
stepping stone to higher office,'' Lazio said. Mrs. Clinton has
pledged to serve out her term if elected; Giuliani, whose aides
have floated his name as a possible candidate for vice president,
has refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, the chairman of Giuliani's political
committee, declined to comment on Lazio's letter.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was the latest indication that Lazio and Giuliani
seem to be engaged in a game of political chicken. Notwithstanding
Lazio's statements, several Republican leaders believe that in the
end, he may come under so much pressure from party leaders that he
will clear the field for Giuliani, rather than risk long-term
damage to his career.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, some of Giuliani's advisers have said that
the mayor may not proceed with the Senate race if Lazio continues
with his primary challenge. Under that scenario, one associate
said, the mayor would serve out his term and then run for governor,
even if that meant a primary against George Pataki, the Republican
incumbent. Pataki and Giuliani are not on the best of terms; the
mayor's advisers believe that Pataki has been encouraging Lazio to
make this race.
</P>
<P>
   A withdrawal by Giuliani would risk making it appear that he was
shying away from a fight, which would not be in character. Thus,
many Republicans see those remarks as an attempt to force national
Republican leaders to turn up the pressure on Lazio to drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lazio is viewed as a potentially strong candidate
against Giuliani, many Republican leaders believe that the mayor
would be a far stronger challenger to Mrs. Clinton.

OUTDOORS: THE ELUSIVE ATLANTIC SALMON

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MATAPEDIA, Quebec _ ``I think we'll try a Green Machine,'' said
my guide, Charles Irving, thus opening another chapter in my quest
for Atlantic salmon, which had it beginnings 55 years ago on the
River Towy in Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I had wandered to the stream from a nearby hospital where
I was recovering from a chest wound I had received a few days after
jumping into Normandy on D-Day the month before, and an elderly
angler let me make a few feeble casts with his two-handed fly rod.
Most of the afternoon was spent chatting about salmon and salmon
fishing and speculating on when the monstrous anger of the guns
would be silenced.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Charles had anchored our canoe in the confluence of the
Matapedia and Restigouche rivers. Joan Wulff of Lew Beach, N.Y.,
was in a canoe below us with her guide, and Murray and Kay Bring of
Manhattan were similarly ensconced a short distance upstream. We
were fishing Ristigouche Salmon Club waters as the guests of Joseph
Cullman III of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Fly-fishing for Atlantic salmon often involves wild emotional
swings. One sometimes flails away for hours and even days without
raising a fish, desperately striving to keep alert by honing one's
casting techniques or experimenting with various fly patterns. But
the tedium is erased by one savage strike or the water erupting
under a dry fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Machine that Charles Irving gave me is a fat, stubby
fly, the body of which is clipped deer hair dyed green. If I am
left to my own devices when the water is low, I almost always start
with the venerable Blue Charm, but I yielded to Charles, whose
skills I respect.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after I began casting the Green Machine, a big grilse hit
and flung himself out of the fast water. A grilse is a salmon,
usually a male of about five pounds, that returns to its natal
stream after only one year at sea. Charles pulled up the anchor and
poled into the shallows where the fish could be easily netted.
</P>
<P>
   The grilse tore about the pool, leaping three more times, and I
was reveling at being a few minutes away from early success when
the line went slack. The hook had pulled loose. No matter. There
were many more fish in the pool, including some large salmon. After
another half hour of casting, a second fish hit. It was much larger
than the grilse. It didn't jump, but I could feel the weight of it
and I had the notion that it hadn't yet divined its predicament.
Once again the anchor was pulled and we started toward shore with
me waiting for the fish to begin its first long run. Again the hook
pulled free.
</P>
<P>
   Before the morning ended, I had one more heavy strike, but that
time around the fish wasn't hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Wulff, who tried both wet and dry flies, rose no salmon
that morning, but Murray Bring vaulted into a top rod status that
he never relinquished the entire trip, catching a 12-pound salmon
and a grilse and losing a salmon estimated at 16 pounds at the net.
Kay, his wife, took a 10-pounder. The salmon were released.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Cullman's Runnymeade Lodge on the Restigouche for lunch,
our host suggested that he and I, the Brings and Joan Wulff go to
Two Brook camp on the Upsalquitch River that afternoon while the
other members of our party, the entertainer Linda Hart and her
husband, Bill Forster, could remain to fish Runnymeade waters. Two
Brook, owned by Joe and his brother Edgar, is on the Upsalquitch, a
lower Restigouche tributary in New Brunswick. Twisting down through
steep valleys, the Upsalquitch is a haunting, intimate stream.
</P>
<P>
   Hot, dry weather has plagued many of Canada's Atlantic salmon
rivers this summer. Rivers have been low and warm, conditions that
salmon and salmon anglers abhor. The fishing logs at both
Runnymeade and Two Brook told a sad story: only nine salmon or
grilse taken at Runnymeade the entire season up to July 12 and only
18 at Two Brook up to the same date.
</P>
<P>
   The day before we arrived, however, more than two inches of rain
fell in the region and both the Restigouche and the Upsalquitch had
risen more than seven inches and the weather and water had cooled.
</P>
<P>
   At Two Brook, Murray caught a 10-pounder and a grilse. Cullman
and Joan Wulff each caught a grilse and Joan lost another that rose
to a dry fly. With the guide Gerry Thomas as my long-suffering
companion, I spotted, raised _ with both wet and dry flies _ or
occasionally hooked more salmon or grilse than anyone else, but
failed to land any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Runnymeade two nights later we learned that the
Forsters, who had never used fly rods before, had lost two grilse
with Runnymeade's manager Lorne Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   The rivers were falling rapidly and warming as we fished them,
the days were growing hotter and the salmon were sulking. Joe and I
visited Fraser's Pool on the Matapedia as guests of Jack Powers of
Manhattan. My host insisted that I do all the casting. He wanted me
to have a fish to take home; but it was not to be, even though we
had two superb guides, the agile octogenarian Richard Adams and the
incomparable Jack Lyons, a fellow who can cover more water with a
dry fly in half an hour than an ordinary mortal can in half a day.
</P>
<P>
   At our final festive meal at Runnymeade late that night, it
seemed clear that the Forsters had been smitten by Atlantic salmon
fever. Joan Wulff had given them a fly-casting lesson, they had
hooked a brace of grilse and they got a crash course in salmon and
salmon fishing.
</P>
<P>
   They had also learned how deeply Joe Cullman cares for the
Atlantic salmon. Cullman has played a major role in salmon
conservation efforts. He was in on the founding, in 1969, of what
is now the most influential conservation organization of its kind
in the world, the Canadian-American Atlantic Salmon Federation. He
was long its president and continues to spur the effort to save the
salmon from inexcusable exploitation and neglect. In April, for
example, the federation announced that Cullman had recently pledged
$5 million to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that Murray Bring has a big heart. He gave me one of
his two grilse. Twenty years ago I would have refused, but false
pride no longer bedevils me.

   NEW YORK _ Vice President Al Gore made a campaign stop Saturday
in the Bronx, where he broke ground for a new children's hospital
being built at Montefiore Medical Center and called attention to
the links between poverty, pollution and the health of young
people.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the leading contender for the Democratic presidential
nomination next year, cemented his ties with local Democratic
officials and hailed the new hospital as a model for children's
hospitals across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The new hospital will have a comprehensive program to treat
children with asthma. Gore said that the asthma hospitalization
rate for children in the Bronx is five times the normal rate.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Hospital at
Montefiore, said that ``38 percent of children in New York City
homeless shelters have asthma, the highest percentage in the
world.'' Among the causes, he said, are stress, overcrowding and
``environmental factors that we do not fully understand.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore was in the city, the presumptive front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
appeared upstate in Cooperstown, accompanying the former Texas
Ranger pitcher Nolan Ryan, who is being inducted into the Baseball
Hall of Fame. Bush used to own an interest in the team.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the White House has emphasized childhood asthma as an
example of the effect of poverty and pollution on public health,
and New York City has been used before to make a political point of
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, long before she became a contender for the New
York Senate seat, Hillary Rodham Clinton visited the South Bronx to
help start a childhood asthma initiative in the city. This January,
she introduced the administration's $68 million national program to
fight childhood asthma, the largest federal program ever to address
the problem, which affects about 6 million children.
</P>
<P>
   According to the administration, more than 100,000 children are
hospitalized each year because of asthma, making it the leading
cause of hospitalization due to chronic illness for children, at a
cost of $1.9 billion in medical expenses annually.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has cited asthma, which is aggravated by
inhaling smog, as a reason to tighten air quality standards under
rules that industry groups have successfully challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Gore announced that the federal government was
adopting a new air quality index to be used by local weather
forecasters across the country. The new index is based on levels of
smog, soot, carbon monoxide and other pollutants, he said, and it
will, for the first time, recommend specific precautions for people
with respiratory ailments like asthma.
</P>
<P>
   The original air quality index was introduced in 1976 and has
not been updated in more than 20 years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The vice president became interested in Montefiore through his
friendship with Carl Sagan, the astronomer and successful
popularizer of science, who died in 1996. Friends of Sagan are
working with Montefiore to establish a rooftop planetarium and
observatory for children at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will allow children of the Bronx to receive unparalleled
care in an inspirational environment,'' Gore said. ``Every child
can chase the stars, feel loved and connected and be able to live
out his or her dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Redlener, touching on another of the administration's favorite
themes, estimated that there were 300,000 uninsured children in New
York City, including 80,000 to 100,000 in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The new hospital, on Bainbridge Avenue in the Norwood section,
will be affiliated with Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ Good thing Lance Armstrong didn't put his
money where his mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a betting man,'' he said before the Tour de France's
19th of 20 daily stages Saturday, a long time trial, ``I'd put my
money on Zuelle. He needs to beat Escartin.''
</P>
<P>
   The race leader referred to the two men immediately behind him,
Alex Zuelle, a Swiss with the Banesto racing team who was in third
place, and Fernando Escartin, a Spaniard with Kelme who was in
second.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's reasoning was sound and even accurate up to a point.
Zuelle did easily beat Escartin, making up a gap of 1 minute 13
seconds, and move up to second a day before the Tour ends in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong beat Zuelle and everybody else, registering his
fourth stage victory and the third in three time trials, which are
solitary races against the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The first was in the prologue July 3, just 4 miles, which he won
by 7 seconds over the second-placed Zuelle. The second was a
35-mile ride around Metz on July 11, which he won by 58 seconds
over the second-placed Zuelle.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 35 miles Saturday, he won by nine seconds over _ who
else? _ the second-placed Zuelle. Armstrong's teammate Tyler
Hamilton was third, 1:35 behind the winner in a gutsy showing by a
rider who gave his all for his U.S. Postal Service team leader in
the Alps and Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted this victory,'' Armstrong said later Saturday.
``I didn't start with the same fire I had in Metz but I wanted to
show the yellow jersey today.''
</P>
<P>
   He showed the emblem of leadership to vast crowds that stood in
the sun and a strong wind in and around Futuroscope, a theme park
devoted to technology. Armstrong rode like a machine himself,
finishing in 1 hour 8 minutes 17 seconds, a speed of 31 mph _ the
legal top speed for a car _ despite the wind.
</P>
<P>
   That performance increased his overall lead to 7:37 over Zuelle
and 10:26 over Escartin, now in third place. Hamilton jumped three
notches to 13th over all.
</P>
<P>
   Beforehand, relaxed and excited at the same time, Armstrong
lounged in a team trailer and talked about everything that came to
mind _ except for the fact that Sunday he will win the Tour de
France. Until the moment that he pulls the final yellow jersey of
the winner over his head, he refuses to refer to more than ``my
potential victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even the prospect of hundreds of fans who are coming from
back home in Texas to cheer him in Paris could budge Armstrong from
his refusal to claim victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will be surprised at all the people there on the
Champs-Elysees that at the last minute jumped on a plane to Paris
from Texas,'' he said. ``Neighbors, friends. To ride the Tour is
one thing, to ride well is another, to potentially win is another,
but to be there on the Champs-Elysees with family and friends and
neighbors, that's fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' he continued in an interview Friday night.
``I'm ready to get this over with, I'm ready to celebrate with
family and friends, I'm ready to have a good time. I've lived like
a monk for six months,'' since the racing season began.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his white team T-shirt and blue sweat pants, Armstrong looked
remarkably fresh for somebody who was on the verge of completing a
three-week, 2,290-mile trek, often through rain, sometimes through
heavy heat.
</P>
<P>
   If he looks rested, though, he isn't. ``I don't feel fresh,'' he
said. ``I started to feel really tired after Piau-Engaly,'' the
first stage in the Pyrenees last Tuesday. ``That was two weeks into
the race, a rough period for anybody. It was a very hot day and I
had the stress after the race of more doping innuendos and I'd worn
the jersey for a week _ all that was hard for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to reports in the French press that an illegal
substance had been detected in his body after a urinalysis. The
charge surfaced after he won the Tour's prologue on July 3, was
revived after he won the first Alpine stage on July 13 and then
flowered in the Pyrenees, where he again rode strongly.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong then said that he had used a cortisone-based salve to
treat a skin rash and had produced a medical certificate to justify
its use, although he admitted that he had made ``a mistake'' not to
make this public earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Armstrong said some people refused to believe
that he could be fit enough to win the demanding Tour de France 2
and a half years after he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that
had spread to his lungs and brain. Three months of what he
describes as ``very toxic chemotherapy'' checked the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are journalists in France and there are doctors on
French teams who think I've been given something special by my
oncologist,'' he said. ``They think I was given drugs that boost
performance. It's the exact opposite: I was given things that can
kill you.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of talk, it makes me sick. But when the race is
over, that stuff doesn't live. The victory and the people that I
touch and the story that I can tell _ that lives.''
</P>
<P>
   His story is extremely important to him as an example to other
victims of cancer and their families, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to be a cancer survivor and I'm proud to do this, I
really am,'' he said. ``This race and my performance here are going
to affect a lot of people in a positive way, in a wonderful,
fantastic way. I think I've told my story. That's what I always
wanted to do. I've shared my story with the world.'' &QL;

WILLIAM SCHEINMAN, 72, BROKER WHO BEFRIENDED KENYAN LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William X. Scheinman, a self-taught Wall Street analyst who
became an enthusiastic supporter of the independence movement in
Africa, died on May 24 at his home in Reno, Nev., of kidney
failure. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   His ashes were taken to Africa in mid-June, according to his
son, William, and buried on a small island in Lake Victoria next to
the grave of Tom Mboya, the Kenyan political figure who was shot to
death on a Nairobi sidewalk in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Scheinman, who left college after two years and started a
prosperous aircraft-parts company, Arnav Aircraft Associates Inc.,
in Little Ferry, N.J., had befriended Mboya on a trip to Africa in
1956. A few years later, when Mboya visited the United States,
Scheinman introduced him to President John F. Kennedy and other
American political figures. Scheinman, who served on the executive
board of the American Committee on Africa, established the African
American Students Foundation and worked with Mboya to bring
hundreds of Kenyans to study at American universities from 1957 to
1961.
</P>
<P>
   Scheinman turned to Wall Street in the mid-'60s. He began by
reading about investing, then got a license as a broker. Soon he
began working at brokerage houses, first Furman Selz Mager Dietz &AMP;
Birney and then Arthur Wiesenberger &AMP; Co., as a researcher
specializing in technical analysis, which focuses on stock prices
over time, volume of trading and other market patterns.
</P>
<P>
   He started a newsletter called Timings that attracted a
following among institutional investors and was honored by his
colleagues as one of the 18 charter members of the Market
Technicians Association, now the main professional organization for
technical analysts, when it was founded in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Scheinman published a book, ``Why Most Investors Are
Mostly Wrong Most of the Time,'' that was reissued in paperback in
1991 and is still available in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Scheinman was acclaimed for accurately predicting the deep bear
market of 1973-74, but his popularity cooled when he was slow to
recognize the start of the next upswing. He moved to Reno in 1975
and continued to publish his newsletter and advise institutional
investors until his death.
</P>
<P>
   His involvement with Africa continued, as well. In January, for
example, he attended the wedding in Kampala, Uganda, of a daughter
of Mboya, who had been best man at Scheinman's second marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Scheinman, who was the pilot of an amphibious Navy landing craft
in the Pacific during World War II, told friends that he had once
brought down an attacking Japanese fighter plane with a burst of
machine gun fire.
</P>
<P>
   After his try at college, his son said, he ``bummed around'' for
a couple of years with professional poker players in the Midwest.
Then he came to New York, drifted into the jazz world of Harlem and
became a publicist for Count Basie and other musicians before
becoming a salesman for an aircraft-parts company and then starting
his own company.
</P>
<P>
   Scheinman, who was living alone after four marriages ended in
divorce, is survived by his mother, Rosalind Scheinman of
Manhattan; Juliette Fortunato of Manhattan, his first wife and the
mother of his only child, William Scheinman Jr., of Belmont,
Calif., and a brother, Robert of Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Though Scheinman spent years on Wall Street he never looked the
part, eschewing pinstripes for turtlenecks and cowboy boots and, in
later life, drawing his graying hair back into a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was unconventional,'' said Peter Griffiths, an investment
manager in Denver, ``in the way he dressed and the way he
approached the market.''

 WILLIAM TARG, `GODFATHER' EDITOR, DIES AT 92 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Targ, a former editor in chief of G.P.
Putnam's Sons, who agreed to publish Mario Puzo's novel ``The
Godfather'' sight unseen, died on Thursday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Targ, who referred to himself as ``antediluvian,'' was noted for
his commitment to literary work in an age of commercialism and to
the dying art of bookmanship.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1978 from Putnam, where he began as senior editor
in 1964 before moving up to editor in chief. In addition to Puzo,
his roster of authors included Simone de Beauvoir, Ashley Montagu
and Lin Yutang. In 1968 Targ bought Puzo's novel for a $5,000
advance on the strength of an oral presentation after two other
publishers had turned down the work. ``The Godfather'' turned out
to be the most profitable single novel ever published by Putnam,
and the paperback rights were sold for more than $400,000. The
novel also led to the series of ``Godfather'' films by the director
Francis Ford Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   While saying that he was proud to be known as a commercial
editor, Targ lamented that overproduction was the curse of his
industry .
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble with the publishing business is that too many
people who have half a mind to write a book do so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From an early age, Targ was animated by a passion for books. He
was born in Chicago to parents who had emigrated from Russia. Targ,
whose name was originally William Torgownik, dropped out of high
school after losing interest in all but two courses, English and
print shop, where he learned to set type by hand. A precocious
reader, he bought scores of books secondhand and stored them in
produce boxes, refusing to borrow books from the local library.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Chicago was his school, he said. At 18, he took a
job as an office boy at Macmillan, where he read galleys and
crossed paths with writers like Richard Wright, Saul Bellow, Nelson
Algren, Carl Sandburg and Studs Terkel.
</P>
<P>
   At 22 he opened his own bookshop and began to amass what would
become a collection of thousands of rare books and first editions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942 he moved to Cleveland to become editor for the World
Publishing Company's Tower and Forum unit, which produced reprint
editions bound in hard cover that sold for 49 cents. The company
sent him to New York in 1945 to begin a trade-book division. He
rose to editor in chief before moving to Putnam in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement from Putnam, he founded Targ Editions, a
one-man operation that published poetry, criticism and short
fiction, beautifully printed by letter press, and bound, in limited
editions signed by the authors. He w published some 250 editions,
the first of which was ``Nature's First Green,'' a short work by
Henry Roth, who often credited Targ with ending a writer's block
that had lasted for more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Targ is survived by his wife, Roslyn, of Manhattan; a son,
Russell, of Palo Alto, Calif., three grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoirs, ``Indecent Pleasures'' (1975), Targ wrote about
bookmanship, which he said lay at the heart of publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Binding, paper, type arrangement, dust jacket: these elements
are not accidents in the making of a book,'' he wrote. ``Each calls
for expertise and taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must know how the book feels in the hand, how it rests on
the shelf, in the company of other books,'' he continued. ``Does it
have a real life of its own, a character and personality, making it
unlike any other book? Ah! Is it a book one can love and cherish?
And will the author be pleased with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some publishers will respond to the above with a shrug. Who
really cares about the typographic esthetics? Well, someone should,
and that someone should be the editor and the chief executive
officer.''

LONG ISLAND DISTRICT REACTS TO CONGRESSMAN'S MOVE TO DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. _ As Rep. Michael Forbes prepared for another
day trying to persuade Democrats that he was no longer a
Republican, the gathering crowds at the Tanger Outlet Center here
were searching for bargains, with little thought about politics.
</P>
<P>
   Some shoppers said they did not even know that their
congressman, Forbes, had switched parties. Others said they had no
interest in politicians, Republican or Democrat. Those who did
appeared evenly divided over Forbes' future as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think there's that much difference between
Republicans and Democrats,'' said Janet Marshack, 48, of Mastic
Beach, who described herself as an independent voter. ``They all
say and do whatever they believe will get them elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were more charitable. ``Maybe he's just having a midlife
crisis,'' said William Schmidt, 54, of Shoreham, a computer
technician who recently changed jobs. ``I didn't agree with my
boss, so I quit. It was a matter of principle, so I can identify
with what Forbes did.'' Schmidt said he was a Republican, but often
voted for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Despite attacks from some former Republican supporters who
insist he has sown the seeds of his political destruction, Forbes
remains upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a really wonderful week,'' he said Friday
afternoon as he left the Suffolk County Board of Elections in
Yaphank after enrolling as a Democrat. ``I'm making a lot of new
friends, and a lot of my old friends are calling me and reassuring
me that it's not about whether I have a D or R after my name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The calls are running six to one in favor of the move, and
that's among Republicans who say they are fed up, like I am, with
the extremists who are running the House of Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said that when he announced last Saturday that he was
switching parties, he did not know where the move would take him,
personally or politically. ``But this past week has been a pleasant
surprise,'' he said. ``The support has been overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of voters in the 1st Congressional District
are more apt to vote Republican than Democrat, they are known for
an independent streak. They speak and act more like New Englanders
than New Yorkers, and often ignore party lines in the voting booth.
The district covers the eastern end of Long Island and includes the
communities of Brookhaven, Southampton, East Hampton, Shelter
Island, Riverhead, Southold, the eastern half of Smithtown and a
portion of Kings Park.
</P>
<P>
   At a strip mall on Route 58 at the eastern end of the Long
Island Expressway in Riverhead on Thursday, William Jordan, 68, a
retired teacher who lives in Mattituck, said party designation
meant little to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I agree with your policies, I'll vote for you,'' he said.
``If you're against what I believe, I vote against you. It's that
simple with me. So far, I have no quarrel with Forbes, even though
I'm a Republican. Actually, I didn't even known he'd changed
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Monahan, a 30-year-old mother with two young children who
was searching for a shopping cart in a supermarket parking lot,
said she did not know who her congressman was. ``Are you talking
about Forbes, that magazine guy who's always running for
president?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who won 65 percent of the vote when he last ran for
office as a Republican, said he hoped to win another sizable margin
as the Democratic candidate this fall.

<P>
   Diplomats can recognize a duck when they see one: if it looks,
acts and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. So why can't they
recognize the Taliban?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, the Taliban have been looking, acting
and quacking like the government of Afghanistan, yet only three
countries _ all Muslim _ recognize them as such.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan badly needs a recognizable government. Like many
another country, it is an artificial affair, a cartographical
concept matched on the ground not by a harmonious nation but by
peoples who have fought each other for generations, and been fought
over by outsiders for just as long.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes seen as a buffer state, it has proved better at
providing shocks than at absorbing them. It has certainly not
provided stability of government. Yet, under the Taliban, something
like a stable government seems to have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are still challenged by opposition groups, their
grip on the 90 percent of the country that they now control is
hardly in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   After the setback to peace talks in Uzbekistan this week, the
opposition is left with the choice of resuming, in due course, the
search for a power-sharing agreement or of seeking contentment in
an extended sulk. It has little prospect of gaining power through
victory on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   So why does the West not give diplomatic recognition to
Afghanistan's rulers?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that the Taliban are a bunch of Islamic zealots
who treat their own people, especially their women, with scant
regard for modern liberal norms, and would dearly love to see
others treated in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries in their neighborhood, notably Russia, India
and Iran, regard them with the utmost suspicion. The United States
regards them with horror.
</P>
<P>
   They give sanctuary to militants _ some would say terrorists _
including Osama bin Laden, who is accused by America of
masterminding the blowing up of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
last year.
</P>
<P>
   If the Taliban are ducks, they are undeniably ugly ducks.
Moreover, some would argue that, whatever the old rules of
diplomacy, times have moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, ex-dictators like Augusto Pinochet find themselves
arrested on medical trips to London, NATO goes to war to stop
ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and the world is trying to set up an
international criminal court. Morality is now the name of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban may be no more wicked than the Soviet Union was;
they may be no more destabilizing than China; they may treat women
no worse than the Saudis do; but sooner or later new rules must be
brought in.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time. Yet diplomatic recognition need not be the
enemy of morality. Countries recognize each other not because they
like or approve of their counterparts' politics, but because they
must deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   Western countries have plenty to discuss with Afghanistan:
drugs, human rights and terrorism, for a start. By all means seek
to win concessions in return for diplomatic recognition, but do not
imagine that all the benefits of having the Taliban accepted in
world counsels lie with them.
</P>
<P>
   It is very much in the interests of all sorts of outsiders to
see the rulers of Afghanistan crack down on the export of both
drugs and terror. And those who preach morality should want to see
the better treatment of Afghan citizens too.
</P>
<P>
   The motto for the West should be recognize and pressurize.
Isolation, after all, does not necessarily breed moderation.
Conversation, by contrast, may. &QL;

HOME RUNS BY ALFONZO AND VENTURA OUTDO SOSA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some home runs are more equal than others.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Mets needed two homers Saturday to overcome the one
massive, generously applauded drive Sammy Sosa had launched earlier
at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end, the Mets _ baseball's hottest team over the last
seven weeks _ defeated the Chicago Cubs, 2-1, and continued their
drive to unseat the division-leading Atlanta Braves. The pair of
homers by Edgardo Alfonzo and Robin Ventura gave the Mets their
eighth victory in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' rookie starter, Octavio Dotel, lost that third-inning
confrontation with Sosa, but he came back to send Sosa down on
strikes in his next two at-bats. That included a theatrical
eighth-inning battle with a runner on second and the Mets nursing
their one-run lead. Sosa chased a 92-mph fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rolled the dice there,'' manager Bobby Valentine said about
leaving Dotel in to face Sosa. ``But this will be something he can
build on for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel had his second straight strong appearance, going seven and
one-third innings, striking out nine and giving up only five hits
before being relieved by Dennis Cook. Armando Benitez worked the
ninth inning for his 10th save. Dotel's clutch performance came
with his own future uncertain because of the imminent arrival of
Kenny Rogers, who the club hopes is a down-the-stretch winner.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is scheduled to join the club Sunday, throw a bit on the
sideline, and then join the rotation by starting his first game for
the Mets against the Pirates here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Mets already have a five-man rotation in Dotel, Orel
Hershiser, Al Leiter, Masato Yoshii and Rick Reed, Dotel's
performance was a virtual screen test. It will come down to Yoshii
or Dotel as the odd man out. Valentine, tongue in cheek, suggested:
``Who knows? Maybe I'll go with all six guys if it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine added, ``If he's getting outs on breaking balls, he's
a pretty good pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel was under enough pressure, and he had to face Sosa as
well. At least it wasn't merengue night, as it was on Friday when
Shea Stadium was full of Sosa fans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Mets' Family Day, players bringing their
youngsters into the clubhouse and onto the field for a pregame
game.
</P>
<P>
   So who was doing that cheering in the third inning when Sosa
clubbed a home run over the 396-foot sign in right center in the
third? It was everyone, mostly.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium erupted into applause, and Valentine and his players
could not blame the promotion of the night before _ when many
Dominican countrymen of Sosa's attended and wildly cheered his home
run.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Saturday's was a spontaneous cheer for the man leading
the major leagues with 36 home runs _ as if New York was big enough
to encompass the Mets and Sosa, a visitor. Perhaps some of those
applauding in the crowd of 47,995 were the children of Mets'
players.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when Sosa led off the fifth and went down swinging for the
95th time this season, the cheers resounded even louder than for
his home run.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo, less famous but a Met, got an even bigger hand in the
fifth, when he smacked a two-out home run to tie the score. The
420-foot shot came off Steve Trachsel, who came in with a 3-13
record and an earned run average of 6.73, but who had held the Mets
to only a pair of hits before Alfonzo's homer.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, it was time for another Mets blast, this one by
Ventura on a 3-2 pitch that put the Mets ahead by 2-1. They were
the only runs the hapless Trachsel permitted.

   Are Slavs and democracy destined not to mix?
</P>
<P>
   From the harsh plains of northern Europe down to the bloody
Balkans, from the Black Sea across ten time zones to Siberia's
Pacific coast, Slavs have had but feeble and fleeting experiences
of gentle or just government, let alone democracy.
</P>
<P>
   With the fall of communism a decade ago, hopes of freedom rose,
then faded. Two chunks of Slavdom, in particular, have most
patently disappointed: the Slavic core of Russia, Ukraine and
Belarus; and the southern Slavs, centered on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is wrong to presume that Slavs can never be democrats.
Corrupt, incompetent and brutal as many of Europe's post-communist
governments have been, political and economic freedoms, albeit
often of the roughest kind, have burst forth in many places that
had seen none before.
</P>
<P>
   Russian elections at various levels have been a remarkable and
cheering novelty. The young, tough, clever and energetic have
unleashed their creative energies.
</P>
<P>
   And those Slavs who have had stronger and longer historic links
with the West _ Poles and Czechs, to name just some _ are indeed
creating juster, as well as richer, societies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Serbs have been making mayhem in the Balkans,
other southern Slavs (Macedonians, Bulgars and Slovenes, among
them) have been striving valiantly to nurture their new
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that many Belarussians and Ukrainians, as
well as Russians, should hanker after the undemocratic but
comforting order of the past. The change has been traumatic and,
for millions of the poor and weak, for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is still deeply confused. Belarus, a small country of
questionable identity, has fallen under the thrall of a demagogue,
Alexander Lukashenka. Ukraine, with a population of 51 million and
vast economic potential, is a mess.
</P>
<P>
   If the people of those three countries, resenting the West's
seeming arrogance, wish to bond together again and turn their faces
inwards, that is their right.
</P>
<P>
   Though he may be thinking anew, Lukashenka has long sought to
link Belarus to Russia again. With an election for Ukraine's
presidency due in October, several leading candidates want their
country to join up with Russia too. If that happens, the West
cannot object.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a wrong turn _ for the Slavs as much as for the
West. A bigger, yet still unreformed, Russia would be tempted to be
just that much more mischievous and menacing to its small neighbors
than it is already.
</P>
<P>
   Malign as Lukashenka is to his own people, Belarus on its own
would scarcely frighten Poles or Lithuanians in the way an expanded
Russia, with Belarus as its western flank, inevitably would.
</P>
<P>
   The West must keep its doors open to all those Slavs who may
aspire to join its economic and political clubs, especially the
European Union, so long as the prospective members meet the entry
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine, strategically, is the key. Despite the failure of its
economy and the sourness of its politics, it has done well to
persuade the Russians that they should, by treaty, accept its
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   And Russia, it should be said, has done well to recognize that
the disputed Crimean peninsula is sovereign Ukrainian territory,
Russian pride having been salved with special rights for its Black
Sea fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus, though less important geopolitically than Ukraine,
should have the same chance to reach out to the West, especially if
its leader's mooted change of heart is genuine.
</P>
<P>
   The West should do what it can to help and encourage the muzzled
Belarussian opposition. It should lift as many obstacles as
possible to free trade for both Ukraine and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should Russia be cold-shouldered. Throwing money at it is
not the answer. But the idea that Russians, any more than other
Slavs, are allergic to democracy is as absurd as the myth of their
special soulfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Europe will never be truly free until settled democracy extends
all the way to the Urals. The West must prod, persuade and
persevere. &QL;

 &HT;    Armstrong the `Indy car' of cycling
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When the 86th Tour de France concludes today,
the man who will ride in triumph down the storied Champs-Elysees is
almost certain to be Lance Armstrong. Saturday he won his third
straight time trial on the Tour and will carry a substantial 7
minute 37 second lead into today's final, 89 1/2-mile stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great cyclist, one who is driven by huge motivation
and determination,'' conceded second-place Alex Zulle of
Switzerland, one of the prerace favorites who have been unable to
match Armstrong in the arduous 2,292-mile odyssey over the Alps and
Pyrenees and through the French countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pedal stroke apart,'' explained Davis Phinney, a former
U.S. Olympian and current cycling commentator. ``In cycling
everyone has a governor. You reach a point where your lungs are on
fire and your legs seize up. Lance doesn't have that limiter. Most
of us are Jeep Cherokees. He's an Indy car.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring disaster, Armstrong will probably sip champagne today,
but he's just as comfortable pulling on a Shiner Bock. He's an
Austinite, a Texan, an American. He's also a husband, a mother's
son and a survivor who has had a long and sometimes lonely ride to
the top.
</P>
<P>
   He's estranged from both his biological father and the
stepfather that leant him his All-American last name. He'd be Plano
East's most famous graduate, except that school gave him the boot.
He staged a remarkable fight with cancer, only to find that the
professional cycling teams that once courted him, shunned him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at the worst time in my life they wanted to forget
about me,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   And, during this ride of his life, he's not only had to battle
exhaustion and his rivals, but the constant sniping of the French
sporting media, skeptical that anyone could accomplish such a feat
without the aid of performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more out of envy and jealousy than anything else,'' said
Chann McRae, an Austin resident and world-class cyclist who has
known Armstrong since they both were boys. ``Lance is the cleanest
rider in the world. What sets him apart is that he is so strong in
the head. If you make him more angry he only gets better. He rides
on rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was born to a teen-age mother and high school dropout.
Linda Walling, whose maiden name is Mooneyham, married another
17-year-old when she turned 17.
</P>
<P>
   Lance's birth that September in 1971 did little to stabilize the
marriage. It quickly foundered and by the time she was 20, Walling
was married again, to Terry Armstrong, a union that lasted until
Lance was 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, there was just the two of us,'' said Walling,
who married her current husband, John Walling, in 1992. ``All I
did, my life, was going to work and raising my son, and I was happy
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance grew up in Plano, a football-worshipping suburb of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were outcasts,'' McRae said only half jokingly. ``Our high
school did not support us at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong once said that he felt like it was him and his mother
against Plano.
</P>
<P>
   The pack mentality and team sports didn't suit Armstrong or
McRae. They soon gravitated toward individual endurance sports.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong wasn't afraid of taking on anyone, racing 10Ks against
adults when he was just a fifth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   McRae remembered, ``You haven't even reached puberty and you're
beating men 10 years older. You think, hey, I've found my gig.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as teen-agers, they both tried swimming, as Armstrong was
a distance freestyler with City of Plano Swimming, a club team. The
pool was seven miles from his house and Armstrong biked there and
back. On weekends he and McRae would set off on longer jaunts. With
just a pocketful of quarters for drinks and emergency phone calls,
the teen-agers would point their bikes toward Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally we'd head north,'' McRae said. ``Oklahoma is 60 miles
out, 60 miles back. We used to be out in the Texas heat melting
together. I think we ran out of water and almost died of
dehydration about 100 times.''
</P>
<P>
   When they hit the wall or had a flat, they'd phone one of their
moms to pick them up on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had much the same bop-till-you-drop style in racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd bonk sometimes,'' McRae said. ``He'd go all out and he'd
either win or physically explode. He wouldn't go from running to
jogging. He'd go from running to a real slow walk.''
</P>
<P>
   With their riding, running and swimming, the triathlon was a
great fit for both Armstrong and McRae. At the age of 16, Armstrong
was one of the best short-course triathletes in the country. As a
17-year-old, he was that tour's Rookie of the Year, and his prowess
was being noticed outside that sport's small circle. U.S. Cycling
got word that there was a pair of teen-agers in Plano that had some
phenomenal cycling times in the triathlon. Both were invited to
train with the U.S. Junior National Cycling Team. But, there was a
hitch, a big one. School officials at Plano East told them they
couldn't graduate if they took off six weeks during their senior
year.
</P>
<P>
   No is not a word that either Armstrong or his mother liked to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most driven person I've ever met,'' McRae said.
``When he puts his mind to something, he won't let anyone get in
the way of his goal. He has always been that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong transferred to a private school, from which he later
graduated. He also did well enough in training that he made the
1989 Junior Worlds squad, which competed in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was coach of the junior women's team,'' recalled
Phinney, who is married to 1984 Olympic gold medalist Connie
Carpenter Phinney. ``She talked about this guy who would go out
running before he went bike riding. She said he was impressive,
that if he learned technique he'd be unbeatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Phinney encountered Armstrong a little later. ``In 1992 he was
on the U.S. national team,'' Phinney recalled. ``We were in a race
and Lance goes by like an F-14. He left us all behind. At that
point the writing was on the road and it didn't say Phinney, it
said Armstrong. He was born on Mars, and I say that with
admiration. There's not many of them. Michael Jordan. Terrell
Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Armstrong couldn't distance himself from, however, was
huge expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question he is another Greg LeMond. Look at his body. He
has the potential to be a world champion,'' Eddie Borysewicz said
back then. Borysewicz wasn't some gushing fan; he'd been the U.S.
national coach for the 1980 and 1984 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance was so good so soon and had so many people flocking to
him,'' Phinney said. ``That can be a very heady feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also was getting known for his attitude. He could
literally work himself into a rage when he road.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets so mad at his competitors,'' said McRae. ``It could be
about something someone said or just some guy trying to beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   When a win uncorked some of that emotion, Armstrong sometimes
responded by pumping his fist defiantly in the air or with other
gestures that some deemed showboating.
</P>
<P>
   ``People either loved him or hated him,'' Phinney said. ``I
liked his bravado, his take-no-prisoners attitude. You don't want
to be the NBA, but I think our sport needs more of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1992 Armstrong suddenly had little to cheer about.
Instead, he had the wind knocked out of him. He entered the 1992
Olympics as the favorite and the hottest name in the 115-mile road
race in Barcelona. He finished a disappointing 14th. A little
later, in a professional race at San Sebastien in northern Spain,
Armstrong finished 111th in a field of 111. Fans jeered him as a
false phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   He called his mom from the airport in Madrid and told her that
was it, he was done with cycling.
</P>
<P>
   In his new hometown, Austin, where he moved to train on the
nearby hills, Armstrong faced for the first time an uncertain
future. He went in for testing at the Human Performance Laboratory
at the University of Texas to see if there was a scientific reason
for his recent disappointments. It didn't help his mood any that he
was in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a sprained ankle, he could hardly walk. I think it was
the first time he was ever injured,'' said Eddie Coyle, head of the
lab. Tests, however, indicated that Armstrong was indeed in the
right sport. His levels of lactic acid, the substance that creates
the burning sensation in muscles and overwhelming fatigue, were low
even when compared to those of world-class cyclists. And his motor
could run hotter. While other cyclists may have a heart that can
beat a maximum 180 times a minutes, Armstrong can hit that and keep
working. He tops out at around 200 beats per minute. Coyle and
others noted that Armstrong could make some adjustments in his
technique and improve his efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back full of piss and vinegar,'' Coyle said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1993 season Armstrong finished second, behind Mexican
Raul Alcala, in America's biggest stage race, the 11-day Tour
DuPont. He then won three straight races in the U.S. to claim a $1
million prize, posing for cameras with an oversized version of the
prize and his mom. The 21-year-old Armstrong then headed for France
and some seasoning on the granddaddy of all cycling events, the
Tour de France. He won a stage there in a mad sprint in the last 50
yards before withdrawing to prepare for the World Championships in
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   There, he fulfilled his tantalizing potential. In a downpour, on
a slick course where he twice had to recover after crashing,
against Miguel Indurain and many of the world's other great
cyclists, Armstrong staged another one of his F-14 bursts. He won
with such ease that he had time to celebrate harder than any NBA
star after a monster dunk. He ripped the air with bunches, blew
kisses to the crowd and bowed.
</P>
<P>
   King Harald V of Norway summoned him for an audience. But when
messengers told him the invitation was for him alone, they received
a response they hadn't anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong later recalled, ``I don't check my mom at the door. I
don't care who it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Harald V met with the new world champion and the new world
champion's mom.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, the sponsor of the team, had planned to drop its
sponsorship after the 1993 season, but changed its mind because of
Armstrong's success. In 1995 and 1996, Armstrong won the Tour
DuPont, but success on the longer Tour de France proved elusive.
Perhaps that was because Armstrong looked too All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the gaunt look of an endurance cyclist, the
broad-shouldered Armstrong had the appearance of an athlete who
could play any sport or a regular guy who could enjoy an occasional
Mexican dinner washed down with a cold beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's muscle it's a gravity sport. You've got to go
uphill,'' Phinney explained.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1996, Armstrong's world was turned upside down. At the
Atlanta Olympics, where he was favored to go gold, he finished well
out of the medals.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong hadn't given much thought to a swollen testicle. But
while he was at his Austin home one fall day he began spitting up
blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't drops, it was buckets,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Armstrong was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Just
as he steeled himself for that fight, he got another jolt. The
cancer had spread to his lungs and abdomen and even to his brain.
In his lung there were tumors the size of golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very far advanced. It was about as severe as you can
get,'' said Dr. Lawrence Inhering, one of the doctors who treated
Armstrong at Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Given only a 50-50 chance of living, Armstrong endured surgery
and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never pleasant to go through,'' Einhorn said. ``Everybody
gets hair loss. Loss of appetite and nausea. But he was always very
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   He vowed not merely to live, but to resume his demanding life as
a professional cyclist. In 1997, a year after he had stood at
death's door, he was declared cancer free. He began working to
resume his old career and started a new one as a crusader against
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, Armstrong created the nonprofit Lance
Armstrong Foundation. It's premiere event is the Ride for the Roses
here. In 1998 the event raised more than $300,000 for medical
research. The foundation also sponsors a conference and supports
various scientific and research efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most surprising thing was not that he survived,'' said Dr.
Craig Nichols, one of the doctors who treated Armstrong. ``The most
surprising thing, and it was very pleasant and gratifying, was what
he did afterwards, how much he gave back. He's trying to make sure
this doesn't happen to other men.''
</P>
<P>
   If cycling teams appreciated Armstrong's charitable work, they
didn't show it. Cofidis, which had signed him to a lucrative
contract in 1995, dropped him. Others didn't return his calls. He
finally signed with the U.S. Postal Service team with a contract
full of incentives, but not the kind of salary he once commanded.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer treatments, however, had one effect on him that would
make him a cyclist better suited for the Tour de France. He lost
about 15 pounds. Most of it was muscle, but it was that upper body
muscle that just weighs down endurance cyclists.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong married Kristin Richard last year and she and his
mother will be there to share in the celebration if a leaner, far
wiser Armstrong becomes only the second American to win France's
greatest sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   While the French media continue to snipe at Armstrong, those
who've worked with him have no doubts that his performance is real,
and not drug aided.
</P>
<P>
   Coyle has tested Armstrong and his blood over a period of seven
years. He said, ``In all my testing I've seen no evidence of any
drugs. He's totally clean.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he's only one day away from completing perhaps the
greatest comeback in the history of sport.

 &HT;    Armstrong's next stage: TV show circuit
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ After this week, most people in the United
States will have caught a glimpse of Lance Armstrong on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who is set to win the Tour de France in Paris this
afternoon, is scheduled for a one-day, whirlwind media tour in New
York starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   First on the agenda is three days of recuperating and
celebrating his impressive Tour win with his wife and mother at his
European base in Nice, France.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Stapleton, Armstrong's Austin, Texas-based agent, said
Armstrong will fly from France via chartered jet as a guest of Nike
to New York Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   By late Saturday, Armstrong had confirmed appearances on ``Late
Night with David Letterman''; ``Larry King Live''; ``The Today Show
on NBC''; ``CBS This Morning'' and on ``Live with Regis and Kathie
Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also likely will make an appearance on ABC's ``Good
Morning America''.
</P>
<P>
   He will return to Europe for several cycling exhibitions and
then will jet back to his home country, visiting Los Angeles on
Aug. 8 for a likely appearance on the ``Jay Leno Show.'' He then
will be feted by Nike, his longtime sponsor, at a party to
celebrate his victory at Nike headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong will be in Austin on Aug. 10, where a public
celebration is in the planning stages. Stapleton said a parade and
reception has been mentioned.

 &HT;    Aggressive ride keeps Armstrong in lead
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ Linda Armstrong was almost in tears
Saturday afternoon as she gave into the emotions of seeing her only
child, a near three-year cancer survivor, cement his status as one
of the best athletes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even have the words to describe this,'' she said as
she desperately tried to hold back a sob. ``We were facing death in
the eye and to come back at this level ... This proves that there
is hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, Lance Armstrong, her 27-year-old son, had
presented his mother, who had arrived here the night before, with
two large bouquets, one of red flowers, signifying his victory
Saturday in the Futuroscope time trial, and a yellow bunch of roses
to commemorate his overall lead in the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   A joyous Armstrong, who has grown stronger through the
three-week long Tour, finished the 35-mile time trial in 1 hour, 8
minutes and 17 seconds. He was the last rider on the course, but he
was so dominate that he passed his main competition, Fernando
Escartin, despite the Spaniard's two-minute head start.
</P>
<P>
   ``To finish with a stage victory is just incredible,'' Armstrong
said. ``I really wanted to win this time trial badly. I didn't
start with the same fire as in the Metz time trial, but I was
really hungry to show the yellow jersey. I really suffered in the
last 10 kilometers, and I knew it would come down to the best guy
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Added his mother, ``His ride was awesome, but I never was
sitting comfortable while he was out there. Every word out of my
mouth was ``ride safe, ride safe, ride safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had no problems riding both fast and safe. He led at
all four intermediate posts, averaging about 30 miles per hour
through the race. Most riders were begrudgingly conceding Saturday
that Armstrong was by far the best in this 2,400-mile race that
ends today as the field rides from Arpajon to downtown Paris, where
the group will circle the 329-year-old Champs Elysees 10 times,
with landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Grand Palais and the Arc
de Triomphe serving as historical backdrops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armstrong again confirmed that he was the strongest,'' said
Alex Zulle, the Swiss rider who appeared to have won Saturday's
time trial until Armstrong beat him by a dominating nine seconds.
``I rode all out and took all kinds of risks throughout the three
weeks, but couldn't beat the American. Again it was a hard day
because of the wind and the pressure. But to lose by nine seconds
only proves that, even without the crash in Gios (stage two), I
couldn't have beaten Lance.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong continued his domination of the field, picking up his
fourth stage win. He won both Tour time trials and the short
prologue that kicked off the event July 3. He also won the first
mountain stage in the French Alps on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton, Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service teammate,
finished third at 1:09.52. Typically, the last time trial in the
Tour has little effect on the overall standings. But Zulle was able
to pass Escartin into second place overall, but he still was 7:37
behind Armstrong. Escartin, who had been 6:15 behind Armstrong
before Saturday, lost 4:11 during the stage that started and ended
at Futuroscope, an amusement park about a three hours drive south
of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see what I had left after a three-week Tour,
especially considering all the work I did for Lance,'' Hamilton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and Hamilton helped cement U.S. Postal's grasp as the
Tour's best team, a small feat in itself since the American group
was one of the last to be included in the 20-team field.
Armstrong's team received its invitation less than three weeks
before the start of the Tour, while 16 of the teams, the ones
designated as the world's best, knew they were riding to Paris in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's stage was an emotional one for the smattering of
Americans who were among the thousands of fans who stood 10 to 12
people deep in some places along the time trial route. Linda
Armstrong arrived in time from Richardson, Texas, to see her son
claim victory. She was accompanied by two Austin, Texas, residents,
Danny and Charlotte Pounds, who live along the shores of Lake
Austin near Armstrong's Mediterranean-style mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance's race was amazing,'' said Charlotte Pounds. ``It's just
a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   A large Texas flag hung most of the afternoon from the back door
of the U.S. Postal Service team van which Armstrong used as a
warm-up area. About 100 fans started gathering beside the van more
than an hour before Armstrong started the time trial. Included in
that group were three members of the U.S. Disabled Cycling Team who
had competed earlier in the day in a time trial of the European
Open at Blois, about 100 miles from Futuroscope.
</P>
<P>
   The trio wanted any kind of Armstrong souvenir. They were given
the Postal team's signature blue caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a point of making it down here,'' said David Conklin,
a resident of LaCrosse, Wis., who suffered a spinal cord injury in
a motorcycle accident. ``This is so great for U.S. Cycling. What
Lance has overcome and his desire to compete is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's immediate fan base will swell today when he is
joined by his wife Kristin, who has made only a handful of stages
because she is almost seven months pregnant with the couple's first
child. Kristin Armstrong's mother, father and brother also flew in
from Minnesota to see the final stage.
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate the final stage, Nike has furnished a special
pair of yellow cycling shoes for Armstrong to wear. And Armstrong
will use a new bicycle that has been painted navy blue and
decorated with the insignia of the Lance Armstrong Foundation,
which Armstrong created in November 1996 to promote testicular
cancer awareness, two months after he was diagnosed with an
advanced form of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime Saturday night, Linda Armstrong presented her son with
gifts _ a homemade loaf of banana bread, an ``I love Daddy,'' bib
for the newborn and a small travel-sized book filled with sayings
and advice for new fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance has always wanted children,'' she said. ``He's going to
make a great dad.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For those who consider America a healthily
meritocratic country, with a less healthy penchant for political
correctness, the past week has been something of a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   The airwaves and newsstands have been dominated by the tragic
death of a likeable, intelligent young man who was still best known
for his family name and his rugged good looks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the instruments of the multimedia age have been bent on
recreating the atmosphere of a medieval court, mourning the loss of
a dauphin.
</P>
<P>
   Since the aircraft flown by John F. Kennedy Jr., with his wife
and sister-in-law as passengers, disappeared somewhere off Martha's
Vineyard in Massachusetts, America has seen, heard and read little
else.
</P>
<P>
   There have been exceptions _ notably the New York Times, which
gave his disappearance front-page billing but did not make it the
main story. But the news magazines all increased their newsstand
print runs (four times in Time's case), and television in
particular has been unyielding.
</P>
<P>
   News anchors, the town criers of the age, have quoted tearfully
from the musical ``Camelot.'' Most normal schedules have
disappeared. Media camps have sprung up outside the Kennedy castle
of Hyannisport, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg's house in Long Island
and the Connecticut home of John Kennedy's in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   The saturation coverage is continued through the grisly recovery
of wreckage and bodies, and then on to funerals and memorial
services.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kennedys, a family for whom Luke 12:48 (``For unto
whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required'') has
become more than a motto, this will be another ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline, John Kennedy's sister, has now lost both parents,
three siblings (another brother in infancy, a sister stillborn),
two uncles _ both died young and violently _ and numerous cousins.
For the Bessettes, the experience may well be even more gruelling.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a hurricane of words and pictures? The question is
worth asking because it goes to the heart of many of the debates
about modern celebrity: most notably, the question of whether the
media are merely sating an unquenchable thirst, or are
force-feeding a reluctant public.
</P>
<P>
   Few would deny that the deaths deserved wide attention. Only the
hardest heart could fail to be moved by the drama of young lives
cut short, particularly given the Kennedys' place in modern
American history. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Loeb, the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review,
thinks that, if anything, the New York Times underplayed the story
at first. He also points out that sales of magazines such as People
always rise when they feature recently departed celebrities on the
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy (who was on People's cover 15 times) has been a national
figure ever since his babyhood in the White House and a national
icon ever since, at three, he saluted his father's coffin at his
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Without the memory of that heartbreaking gesture, some were
saying this week, his death might have been less affecting.
</P>
<P>
   The main networks recorded a sharp increase in viewership for
their Saturday afternoon programs compared with a year ago (though
the evening figures were not substantially different).
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post, which was still running 11 pages on the
affair four days later, reports a marked increase in sales. There
was also a surge of interest in Internet chat-rooms devoted to the
subject. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, supply factors are also plainly at work.
Kennedy's death happened at the peak of what might be called a slow
news summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Kosovo ended, we have had practically no hard
news,'' admits a senior editor at one American news magazine,
pointing to the recent splurge of covers on topics such as health,
Latin pop music and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   This challenge has been even harder for the squadron of
news-and-pundits television channels such as CNN, MSNBC, Fox News
and CNBC. The long-drawn-out search for Kennedy's aircraft (finally
found on July 20) could have been made for their format.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few signs of a modest backlash. Local talk-radio
hosts, such as Tom Leykis in Los Angeles, have begun to complain
about spending so much time on someone who achieved so relatively
little _ and also about the fact that much more may have been spent
on finding Kennedy's aircraft than on many others.
</P>
<P>
   Another provocateur, Mark Steyn, writing in Britain's Daily
Telegraph, notes that local affiliates in places like Burlington,
Vt., have shown limited interest in a man who could be summed up as
the ``glossy editor of a magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, he argues, a generational gap between the
Camelot-obsessed elderly editors at the main networks and their
younger, savvier contemporaries at local stations.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University
and the author of a forthcoming book on celebrity (``What Price
Fame?'' to be published next year by Harvard University Press),
also subscribes to the view that the coverage has been excessive,
and out of contact with the broad mass of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's death, he argues, will come to be seen as ``just
another installment in the Kennedy family novel'' rather than a
totemic event like his father's death or that of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the princess's death, the most often-cited comparison,
reinforces the suspicion that the media frenzy around Kennedy has
been at least partly supply-driven. To begin with, she was much
more famous than he was _ around ten times, by one crude measure.
</P>
<P>
   A quick Lexis-Nexis search of newspapers finds 3,414 mentions of
the princess in the 90 days before she died, against only 357 for
Kennedy (even if it is limited to American papers, the ratio is
around 5:1). And she was on People's cover 50 times.
</P>
<P>
   More tellingly, the most memorable aspects of Diana's death _
London covered in flowers, the thunderous acclamation for her
brother's speech _ were unscripted events, often it seemed in
defiance of a cynical media. The mass hysteria about her death had,
in marketing jargon, a bottom-up quality. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS ENDS HERE AT XXXX) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where Kennedy lived a remarkably normal life,
something similar has happened: ``The queues get longer every
day,'' says one of the increasing number of policemen shepherding
the mourners outside Kennedy's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston and Washington, two other Kennedy strongholds (and
coincidentally two media-industry centers) feelings have also run
high. But in general his death has been an affair that Americans
have so far watched, rather than got up and done something about. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is not, it should be said at once, a case of transatlantic
one-upmanship. By many standards, John Kennedy was a more admirable
figure than the princess.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of her dignity and grace; but these
compliments apply even better to a man who had to live his entire
life in a fish bowl. Unlike the princess, there were few tantrums,
no vengeful late-night whispers to the Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sexiest man alive'' (People again) dated movie stars (who
wouldn't?), but he broke a family tradition by doing so only when
he was unmarried.

   NEW YORK _ For those who consider America a healthily
meritocratic country, with a less healthy penchant for political
correctness, the past week has been something of a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   The airwaves and newsstands have been dominated by the tragic
death of a likeable, intelligent young man who was still best known
for his family name and his rugged good looks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the instruments of the multimedia age have been bent on
recreating the atmosphere of a medieval court, mourning the loss of
a dauphin.
</P>
<P>
   Since the aircraft flown by John F. Kennedy Jr., with his wife
and sister-in-law as passengers, disappeared somewhere off Martha's
Vineyard in Massachusetts, America has seen, heard and read little
else.
</P>
<P>
   There have been exceptions _ notably the New York Times, which
gave his disappearance front-page billing but did not make it the
main story. But the news magazines all increased their newsstand
print runs (four times in Time's case), and television in
particular has been unyielding.
</P>
<P>
   News anchors, the town criers of the age, have quoted tearfully
from the musical ``Camelot.'' Most normal schedules have
disappeared. Media camps have sprung up outside the Kennedy castle
of Hyannisport, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg's house in Long Island
and the Connecticut home of John Kennedy's in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   The saturation coverage is continued through the grisly recovery
of wreckage and bodies, and then on to funerals and memorial
services.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kennedys, a family for whom Luke 12:48 (``For unto
whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required'') has
become more than a motto, this will be another ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline, John Kennedy's sister, has now lost both parents,
three siblings (another brother in infancy, a sister stillborn),
two uncles _ both died young and violently _ and numerous cousins.
For the Bessettes, the experience may well be even more gruelling.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a hurricane of words and pictures? The question is
worth asking because it goes to the heart of many of the debates
about modern celebrity: most notably, the question of whether the
media are merely sating an unquenchable thirst, or are
force-feeding a reluctant public.
</P>
<P>
   Few would deny that the deaths deserved wide attention. Only the
hardest heart could fail to be moved by the drama of young lives
cut short, particularly given the Kennedys' place in modern
American history. &QL;

   Marshall Loeb, the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review,
thinks that, if anything, the New York Times underplayed the story
at first. He also points out that sales of magazines such as People
always rise when they feature recently departed celebrities on the
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy (who was on People's cover 15 times) has been a national
figure ever since his babyhood in the White House and a national
icon ever since, at three, he saluted his father's coffin at his
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Without the memory of that heartbreaking gesture, some were
saying this week, his death might have been less affecting.
</P>
<P>
   The main networks recorded a sharp increase in viewership for
their Saturday afternoon programs compared with a year ago (though
the evening figures were not substantially different).
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post, which was still running 11 pages on the
affair four days later, reports a marked increase in sales. There
was also a surge of interest in Internet chat-rooms devoted to the
subject. &QL;

   On the other hand, supply factors are also plainly at work.
Kennedy's death happened at the peak of what might be called a slow
news summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Kosovo ended, we have had practically no hard
news,'' admits a senior editor at one American news magazine,
pointing to the recent splurge of covers on topics such as health,
Latin pop music and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   This challenge has been even harder for the squadron of
news-and-pundits television channels such as CNN, MSNBC, Fox News
and CNBC. The long-drawn-out search for Kennedy's aircraft (finally
found on July 20) could have been made for their format.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few signs of a modest backlash. Local talk-radio
hosts, such as Tom Leykis in Los Angeles, have begun to complain
about spending so much time on someone who achieved so relatively
little _ and also about the fact that much more may have been spent
on finding Kennedy's aircraft than on many others.
</P>
<P>
   Another provocateur, Mark Steyn, writing in Britain's Daily
Telegraph, notes that local affiliates in places like Burlington,
Vt., have shown limited interest in a man who could be summed up as
the ``glossy editor of a magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, he argues, a generational gap between the
Camelot-obsessed elderly editors at the main networks and their
younger, savvier contemporaries at local stations.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University
and the author of a forthcoming book on celebrity (``What Price
Fame?'' to be published next year by Harvard University Press),
also subscribes to the view that the coverage has been excessive,
and out of contact with the broad mass of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's death, he argues, will come to be seen as ``just
another installment in the Kennedy family novel'' rather than a
totemic event like his father's death or that of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the princess's death, the most often-cited comparison,
reinforces the suspicion that the media frenzy around Kennedy has
been at least partly supply-driven. To begin with, she was much
more famous than he was _ around ten times, by one crude measure.
</P>
<P>
   A quick Lexis-Nexis search of newspapers finds 3,414 mentions of
the princess in the 90 days before she died, against only 357 for
Kennedy (even if it is limited to American papers, the ratio is
around 5:1). And she was on People's cover 50 times.
</P>
<P>
   More tellingly, the most memorable aspects of Diana's death _
London covered in flowers, the thunderous acclamation for her
brother's speech _ were unscripted events, often it seemed in
defiance of a cynical media. The mass hysteria about her death had,
in marketing jargon, a bottom-up quality. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS ENDS HERE AT XXXX) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where Kennedy lived a remarkably normal life,
something similar has happened: ``The queues get longer every
day,'' says one of the increasing number of policemen shepherding
the mourners outside Kennedy's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston and Washington, two other Kennedy strongholds (and
coincidentally two media-industry centers) feelings have also run
high. But in general his death has been an affair that Americans
have so far watched, rather than got up and done something about. &QL;

   This is not, it should be said at once, a case of transatlantic

<P>
   Much has been made of her dignity and grace; but these
compliments apply even better to a man who had to live his entire
life in a fish bowl. Unlike the princess, there were few tantrums,
no vengeful late-night whispers to the Daily Mail.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For those who consider America a healthily
meritocratic country, with a less healthy penchant for political
correctness, the past week has been something of a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   The airwaves and newsstands have been dominated by the tragic
death of a likeable, intelligent young man who was still best known
for his family name and his rugged good looks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the instruments of the multimedia age have been bent on
recreating the atmosphere of a medieval court, mourning the loss of
a dauphin.
</P>
<P>
   Since the aircraft flown by John F. Kennedy Jr., with his wife
and sister-in-law as passengers, disappeared somewhere off Martha's
Vineyard in Massachusetts, America has seen, heard and read little
else.
</P>
<P>
   There have been exceptions _ notably the New York Times, which
gave his disappearance front-page billing but did not make it the
main story. But the news magazines all increased their newsstand
print runs (four times in Time's case), and television in
particular has been unyielding.
</P>
<P>
   News anchors, the town criers of the age, have quoted tearfully
from the musical ``Camelot.'' Most normal schedules have
disappeared. Media camps have sprung up outside the Kennedy castle
of Hyannisport, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg's house in Long Island
and the Connecticut home of John Kennedy's in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   The saturation coverage is continued through the grisly recovery
of wreckage and bodies, and then on to funerals and memorial
services.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kennedys, a family for whom Luke 12:48 (``For unto
whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required'') has
become more than a motto, this will be another ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline, John Kennedy's sister, has now lost both parents,
three siblings (another brother in infancy, a sister stillborn),
two uncles _ both died young and violently _ and numerous cousins.
For the Bessettes, the experience may well be even more gruelling.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a hurricane of words and pictures? The question is
worth asking because it goes to the heart of many of the debates
about modern celebrity: most notably, the question of whether the
media are merely sating an unquenchable thirst, or are
force-feeding a reluctant public.
</P>
<P>
   Few would deny that the deaths deserved wide attention. Only the
hardest heart could fail to be moved by the drama of young lives
cut short, particularly given the Kennedys' place in modern
American history. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Loeb, the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review,
thinks that, if anything, the New York Times underplayed the story
at first. He also points out that sales of magazines such as People
always rise when they feature recently departed celebrities on the
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy (who was on People's cover 15 times) has been a national
figure ever since his babyhood in the White House and a national
icon ever since, at three, he saluted his father's coffin at his
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Without the memory of that heartbreaking gesture, some were
saying this week, his death might have been less affecting.
</P>
<P>
   The main networks recorded a sharp increase in viewership for
their Saturday afternoon programs compared with a year ago (though
the evening figures were not substantially different).
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post, which was still running 11 pages on the
affair four days later, reports a marked increase in sales. There
was also a surge of interest in Internet chat-rooms devoted to the
subject. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, supply factors are also plainly at work.
Kennedy's death happened at the peak of what might be called a slow
news summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Kosovo ended, we have had practically no hard
news,'' admits a senior editor at one American news magazine,
pointing to the recent splurge of covers on topics such as health,
Latin pop music and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   This challenge has been even harder for the squadron of
news-and-pundits television channels such as CNN, MSNBC, Fox News
and CNBC. The long-drawn-out search for Kennedy's aircraft (finally
found on July 20) could have been made for their format.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few signs of a modest backlash. Local talk-radio
hosts, such as Tom Leykis in Los Angeles, have begun to complain
about spending so much time on someone who achieved so relatively
little _ and also about the fact that much more may have been spent
on finding Kennedy's aircraft than on many others.
</P>
<P>
   Another provocateur, Mark Steyn, writing in Britain's Daily
Telegraph, notes that local affiliates in places like Burlington,
Vt., have shown limited interest in a man who could be summed up as
the ``glossy editor of a magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, he argues, a generational gap between the
Camelot-obsessed elderly editors at the main networks and their
younger, savvier contemporaries at local stations.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University
and the author of a forthcoming book on celebrity (``What Price
Fame?'' to be published next year by Harvard University Press),
also subscribes to the view that the coverage has been excessive,
and out of contact with the broad mass of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's death, he argues, will come to be seen as ``just
another installment in the Kennedy family novel'' rather than a
totemic event like his father's death or that of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the princess's death, the most often-cited comparison,
reinforces the suspicion that the media frenzy around Kennedy has
been at least partly supply-driven. To begin with, she was much
more famous than he was _ around ten times, by one crude measure.
</P>
<P>
   A quick Lexis-Nexis search of newspapers finds 3,414 mentions of
the princess in the 90 days before she died, against only 357 for
Kennedy (even if it is limited to American papers, the ratio is
around 5:1). And she was on People's cover 50 times.
</P>
<P>
   More tellingly, the most memorable aspects of Diana's death _
London covered in flowers, the thunderous acclamation for her
brother's speech _ were unscripted events, often it seemed in
defiance of a cynical media. The mass hysteria about her death had,
in marketing jargon, a bottom-up quality. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS ENDS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where Kennedy lived a remarkably normal life,
something similar has happened: ``The queues get longer every
day,'' says one of the increasing number of policemen shepherding
the mourners outside Kennedy's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston and Washington, two other Kennedy strongholds (and
coincidentally two media-industry centers) feelings have also run
high. But in general his death has been an affair that Americans
have so far watched, rather than got up and done something about. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is not, it should be said at once, a case of transatlantic
one-upmanship. By many standards, John Kennedy was a more admirable
figure than the princess.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of her dignity and grace; but these
compliments apply even better to a man who had to live his entire
life in a fish bowl. Unlike the princess, there were few tantrums,
no vengeful late-night whispers to the Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sexiest man alive'' (People again) dated movie stars (who
wouldn't?), but he broke a family tradition by doing so only when
he was unmarried.
</P>
<P>
   And by some standards he was a classier act than Diana. Madonna
may not be everybody's cup of tea, but she is rather more
challenging romantic material than, say, Major James Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the ironies of the current mediafest around John
Kennedy is that the inspiration for it all made fairly sparing use
of his celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   His last ``public'' appearance was at a Yankees game, as a
paying customer. He roller-bladed rather than stretch-limoed his
way around town. His main attempt to capitalize on his fame was
George, a political magazine he started that was facing an
uncertain future even before he died.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, much of his life was spent trying to redress the
Kennedy family's penchant for being, as he put it, ``poster boys
for bad behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   He loathed gossipy speculation about the ``curse of the
Kennedys,'' focusing instead on the family's (patchy) role as the
nation's liberal conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the future a political career beckoned; he was
approached about the New York Senate seat with which Hillary
Clinton is now dallying but said that ``the timing wasn't right,
that it was something to be approached in a matter of years.''
</P>
<P>
   This reticence seems to have been turned against him. Always
treated as a man with potential, Kennedy has in effect become a
blank piece of paper on which countless pundits can scribble their
own theories.
</P>
<P>
   Until another news story breaks the current cycle, the
temptation for the networks to continue through the various ``what
ifs'' of his life, interspersed with grim footage from the ocean
floor, will be strong.
</P>
<P>
   Unlucky, it now seems, in so many things, a man who wanted to
keep his life private and recast his family's reputation could not
have happened upon a worse way or a worse weekend to die. &QL;

first glance, the proposed Caribbean Basin Parity Trade Initiative
winding its way through Congress looks like small beans. But the
measure, being pushed by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., as well as
President Clinton, merits attention for several reasons. First, the
region is the United States' sixth-largest export market. Second,
the measure would eliminate tariffs on a variety of items including
clothes and watches, meaning the prices for those items in U.S.
stores should go down. And the measure could boost economies in the
Caribbean, which would hopefully stem immigration that has
skyrocketed since last year's hurricanes. We look at the impact of
CBI on the average Joe, and in particular on states such as

Mexico is creeping toward democracy, and elections are hotter than
ever thanks to a more vigilant press, the use of polls and more

controls most of Mexican political life, will be tested in July by
opposition candidates who have mustered unprecedented strength,
especially the brash Vicente Fox of Mexico's conservative
opposition. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, on the left, has fallen behind in

<P>
   They waddle slowly through the shopping malls; drive with
exaggerated care on the freeways; fumble with their change at the
checkout tills.
</P>
<P>
   In America's impatient culture, where competition is everything
and the richest man (counting his Microsoft billions just east of
Seattle) is only 43, it is easy to deride the elderly as
preordained losers, to be lectured at rather than listened to.
</P>
<P>
   As Oscar Wilde pointed out more than a century ago, ``In
America, the young are always ready to give to those who are older
than themselves the full benefit of their inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is it that the concerns of the old are the obsessions of
the political establishment?
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years the policy debate has been dominated not
by education, or race, or the environment, or gun control _ all of
them worthy enough topics for most Americans _ but by the future of
Medicare and Social Security, the two entitlement programs for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Is this because American politicians have charitable feelings
that other Americans lack? Or because, pace Wilde, they respect the
aged even as they themselves strive so hard to appear unchangingly
young?
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, the reason lies elsewhere: in the simple fact that
the old vote more readily than the young.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 federal elections, for example, just under half of
the electorate aged 25-44 voted, accounting for 39 percent of the
turnout. By contrast, 64 percent of voters aged 45-64 voted and 67
percent of those aged 65 or over; together they accounted for 53
percent of the turnout.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you win the votes of the old and those who
can see old age fast approaching, you win the election _ a formula
that becomes ever more convincing as Americans live longer and as
the baby-boomers move past the menopause.
</P>
<P>
   One youngish Democratic strategist bluntly explains: ``If
they're going to pander to me by coming out to vote, I'm going to
pander to them.'' Translate that into policy, and it means
emphasizing things like Social Security and downplaying tax cuts
(after all, the retired don't pay much tax).
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Democrats can present themselves as the party of
the New Deal, when Franklin Roosevelt introduced Social Security
specifically to abolish poverty among the old.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Republicans are ready to jeopardize the
retirement safety net with wild schemes of privatization.
</P>
<P>
   How well this Democratic plan will work in next year's elections
remains to be seen. After all, in last year's midterm elections
elderly whites _ though not blacks _ tended to vote Republican,
apparently in protest at President Bill Clinton's antics with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case it must surely be a mistake (typical of the
young) to characterize the old as being all alike. Democrats like
to describe as typical the 70-year-old widow, able to get by for
the moment but terrified by the prospect of unaffordable nursing
care and prescription drugs (which are the fastest growing area of
spending by the old).
</P>
<P>
   The Republican riposte usually features the retired shopkeeper,
made wealthy by the stock market boom and hoping not to be
clobbered by capital-gains tax, or the arthritic farmer, anxious
that his descendants will not be impoverished by inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic and Republican images are selective snapshots of
a reality in which the median net worth of households headed by
Americans aged 65 or over is around double the national average _
but in which a tenth of such households are also living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. It is surely pleasant for all the old, so often
ignored by their children (32 million Americans aged 65 and over
live alone), to feel wanted, even if only by politicians and
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle, however, is their reluctance to enjoy being old, to
admit to being ``grey warriors'' even as the politicians pay homage
to grey power.
</P>
<P>
   The old are not ``old,'' they are ``senior citizens''; their
persuasive lobby group, the AARP, calls itself an association of
``retired persons'' (which may be reasonable enough since its
membership begins at the age of 50); their retirement ghettos in
Florida and Arizona are ``gated communities,'' some of which offer
``assisted living'' for those who have become physically or
mentally ``challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense this reluctance is doubtless universal. It seems
unlikely, for example, that the Japanese, even as they preach that
age, wisdom and power all go together, actually appreciate seeing
the effects of gravity on their aging bodies. And no one,
regardless of race or culture, can be happy as muscles and memory
begin to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Americans are surely unique in their determination not
to grow old gracefully. Last year, for example, they paid for
almost 2.8 million cosmetic procedures, from ``tummy tucks'' to
hair transplants, which were designed either to adjust reality or
to stave off the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, almost a quarter were done to the bodies of baby
boomers and their siblings in their 50s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Is such suffering endured in a good cause? In the sense that the
more competition the better, maybe so. Let the old, if they feel so
inclined, strive against the young for everyone's economic benefit.
But let them not feel they have to be so inclined.
</P>
<P>
   When Americans are asked to define the age at which ``old''
begins, those who are aged 18-24 answer 58 _ but those aged 65 or
over answer 75.
</P>
<P>
   With luck that shift of definition is positive, evidence that
today's new ``seniors'' are enjoying the rejuvenating effects of
Viagra, HRT and the rest of the pharmacopoeia pressed on them at
every commercial break in the TV programming.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a less happy explanation. Even though the
advance of medicine is slowing the aging process and extending
life-expectancy, some 63 percent of American adults would,
according to an AARP survey, prefer not to live to 100.
</P>
<P>
   The leading reason for their reluctance is a fear of being in
poor health, but the second reason _ cited by 38 percent of the
poll _ is the fear of not having enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Add those feelings of insecurity to the demographic arithmetic
(the number of 65-and-overs will almost double in the next 30
years), and no wonder Democrats and Republicans alike have decided
to use the budget surplus to ``save Social Security first.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not, if in electoral terms age comes so clearly before
beauty? If the young object, they can always go and vote. &QL;

<P>
   They waddle slowly through the shopping malls; drive with
exaggerated care on the freeways; fumble with their change at the
checkout tills.
</P>
<P>
   In America's impatient culture, where competition is everything
and the richest man (counting his Microsoft billions just east of
Seattle) is only 43, it is easy to deride the elderly as
preordained losers, to be lectured at rather than listened to.
</P>
<P>
   As Oscar Wilde pointed out more than a century ago, ``In
America, the young are always ready to give to those who are older
than themselves the full benefit of their inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is it that the concerns of the old are the obsessions of
the political establishment?
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years the policy debate has been dominated not
by education, or race, or the environment, or gun control _ all of
them worthy enough topics for most Americans _ but by the future of
Medicare and Social Security, the two entitlement programs for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Is this because American politicians have charitable feelings
that other Americans lack? Or because, pace Wilde, they respect the
aged even as they themselves strive so hard to appear unchangingly
young?
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, the reason lies elsewhere: in the simple fact that
the old vote more readily than the young.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 federal elections, for example, just under half of
the electorate aged 25-44 voted, accounting for 39 percent of the
turnout. By contrast, 64 percent of voters aged 45-64 voted and 67
percent of those aged 65 or over; together they accounted for 53
percent of the turnout.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you win the votes of the old and those who
can see old age fast approaching, you win the election _ a formula
that becomes ever more convincing as Americans live longer and as
the baby-boomers move past the menopause.
</P>
<P>
   One youngish Democratic strategist bluntly explains: ``If
they're going to pander to me by coming out to vote, I'm going to
pander to them.'' Translate that into policy, and it means
emphasizing things like Social Security and downplaying tax cuts
(after all, the retired don't pay much tax).
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Democrats can present themselves as the party of
the New Deal, when Franklin Roosevelt introduced Social Security
specifically to abolish poverty among the old.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Republicans are ready to jeopardize the
retirement safety net with wild schemes of privatization.
</P>
<P>
   How well this Democratic plan will work in next year's elections
remains to be seen. After all, in last year's midterm elections
elderly whites _ though not blacks _ tended to vote Republican,
apparently in protest at President Bill Clinton's antics with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case it must surely be a mistake (typical of the
young) to characterize the old as being all alike. Democrats like
to describe as typical the 70-year-old widow, able to get by for
the moment but terrified by the prospect of unaffordable nursing
care and prescription drugs (which are the fastest growing area of
spending by the old).
</P>
<P>
   The Republican riposte usually features the retired shopkeeper,
made wealthy by the stock market boom and hoping not to be
clobbered by capital-gains tax, or the arthritic farmer, anxious
that his descendants will not be impoverished by inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic and Republican images are selective snapshots of
a reality in which the median net worth of households headed by
Americans aged 65 or over is around double the national average _
but in which a tenth of such households are also living in poverty.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday morning, cyclists gathered on an island in
the Mississippi River near St. Paul, Minnesota, to embark on the
fourth annual ``Tour de Sprawl,'' a bike tour sponsored by the
Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them held picket signs, but the stunning blue sky and a
soft breeze seemed to soften their protest. Not to say there's none
to be had.
</P>
<P>
   The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul ranked eighth on the
Sierra Club's 1998 blacklist of sprawling cities of 1 million or
more. According to the club's figures, growth there is covering 64
acres a day.
</P>
<P>
   People spend almost three times as long in traffic jams today as
they did in 1982, and the miles of congested freeway are predicted
to double by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all this is clear enough. Because cities at the
edge of metropolitan areas, in Minnesota as elsewhere, are bent on
building a solid tax base, many choose to plan only for big,
expensive houses on big sites.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, communities of huge houses and tiny saplings are
springing up around a golf course or a man-made lake.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity has caused a boom in construction; in 1998, housing
permits in the Twin Cities shot up by 20 percent over the year
before. But most of this building was going on many miles from the
city centers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the older northern and western suburbs of
Minneapolis, schools have closed at an alarming rate as people flee
ever outward. From 1970 to 1990, 78 schools opened in the outer
suburbs, while 162 closed in the central city and the inner
suburban ring.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers there have to travel to the favored suburbs to
work, thus spending more time on the roads and more of their income
on gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Some take ``reverse commutes'' on buses that shuttle workers
from the less-favored spots to the wealthier upstart communities.
These vehicles are sometimes known as ``Soweto buses,'' implying
that workers can work in the leafy suburbs, but aren't fit to live
there.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of groups are struggling to get sprawl under control. The
biggest is the Metropolitan Council, based in St. Paul, a regional
organization that supervises transport, sewerage, housing and
planning.
</P>
<P>
   The council wants houses closer together, with an average of
7,500 square feet of land _ no more _ for every new house built. It
would also like to see housing for the rich, not-so-rich and poor
mixed together and, not least, a centralized, efficient sewerage
system.
</P>
<P>
   These aims were mere dreams until two years ago, when some of
the older suburbs joined forces to wrest control of sewerage and
transport financing from the state government.
</P>
<P>
   That put more than $650 million of state money under the
Metropolitan Council's direct supervision, and made it one of the
largest regional-government bodies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The council's new power allows it to withhold money for sewerage
and transport from new developments in the seven-county
metropolitan area if these do not comply with its planning
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But growth is happening fastest in at least four far-flung
counties that are not under the council's direct domain. There, the
council can do no more than plead with city officials to put limits
on growth.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also carrying out a survey, jointly with Minnesota
Planning, into metropolitan land use, which hopes to knit together
city, county and state organizations to save farmland and open
space and to revitalize the urban core by creating clear boundaries
between city and country.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the council is Ted Mondale, the son of former
Vice-President Walter Mondale. The head of Minnesota Planning is
Dean Barkley of the Reform Party, best known until now for helping
to engineer Governor Jesse Ventura's rise to power.
</P>
<P>
   The survey will also consider how the state can plan housing
developments around the projected light-rail system. The first
line, a 12-mile stretch from the Mall of America in Bloomington to
downtown Minneapolis, will open in 2003. Later, spokes will extend
from Minneapolis outward into the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Planners hope that the system will carry workers cheaply to
their jobs, encourage growth along the railway lines and keep
people from staking claims in distant communities.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the $446 million cost is expected to come from federal
coffers by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, too, has some proposals up his sleeve, not least
because sprawl is affecting him personally.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura grew up in central Minneapolis, but has since settled
down on a 32-acre ranch in Maple Grove on the northwestern edge of
urban development.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy hovers over Maple Grove. In 1995, the Metropolitan
Council required over half of all new housing units there to be
``affordable'' (i.e., for those on low and middling incomes) but,
by 1997, only a fifth of new developments met the test.
</P>
<P>
   One developer brought a civil-rights suit against the city, and
a city manager was fired for trying to push for more housing for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The city then ended a reverse-commute program suggested by the
council. Only pressure from an affiliate of the Catholic
archdiocese persuaded the city to approve a paltry 19 units of
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, huge new (non-affordable) housing developments are
spreading over the cornfields near Ventura's ranch. Rankled by what
he sees from his own back yard, the governor has strongly supported
commuter and light rail transport systems and endorsed, in June,
ten principles for development put forward by Minnesota's Smart
Growth Network.
</P>
<P>
   These included encouraging development in places already
equipped with roads and sewers, rather than in empty country;
providing a mixture of land uses, which might bring with it a
variety of housing and jobs; and promoting ``the revitalization of
existing urban and rural communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ventura has his opponents. Republicans in the state
legislature are suspicious of all these maneuvers and the
left-leaning groups that back them.
</P>
<P>
   They have succeeded in shutting down a fairly new advisory
council on community-based planning, and hope to keep their
opponents from ``densifying'' the outer-ring suburbs which,
increasingly, make up their core constituency.
</P>
<P>
   They do not deny the need for some planning, but are fearful of
what they see as social engineering. Let people live where they
like, they say. Do not force them into planned communities inspired
by some New Urbanist hallucination.
</P>
<P>
   As for the governor, a few local politicians wonder aloud why he
is willing to deny others the right to build on multiple-acre plots
while he enjoys his own. &QL;

<P>
   The council's new power allows it to withhold money for sewerage
and transport from new developments in the seven-county
metropolitan area if these do not comply with its planning
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But growth is happening fastest in at least four far-flung
counties that are not under the council's direct domain. There, the
council can do no more than plead with city officials to put limits
on growth.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also carrying out a survey, jointly with Minnesota
Planning, into metropolitan land use, which hopes to knit together
city, county and state organizations to save farmland and open
space and to revitalize the urban core by creating clear boundaries
between city and country.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the council is Ted Mondale, the son of former
Vice-President Walter Mondale. The head of Minnesota Planning is
Dean Barkley of the Reform Party, best known until now for helping
to engineer Governor Jesse Ventura's rise to power.
</P>
<P>
   The survey will also consider how the state can plan housing
developments around the projected light-rail system. The first
line, a 12-mile stretch from the Mall of America in Bloomington to
downtown Minneapolis, will open in 2003. Later, spokes will extend
from Minneapolis outward into the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Planners hope that the system will carry workers cheaply to
their jobs, encourage growth along the railway lines and keep
people from staking claims in distant communities.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the $446 million cost is expected to come from federal
coffers by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, too, has some proposals up his sleeve, not least
because sprawl is affecting him personally.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura grew up in central Minneapolis, but has since settled
down on a 32-acre ranch in Maple Grove on the northwestern edge of
urban development.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy hovers over Maple Grove. In 1995, the Metropolitan
Council required over half of all new housing units there to be
``affordable'' (i.e., for those on low and middling incomes) but,
by 1997, only a fifth of new developments met the test.
</P>
<P>
   One developer brought a civil-rights suit against the city, and
a city manager was fired for trying to push for more housing for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The city then ended a reverse-commute program suggested by the
council. Only pressure from an affiliate of the Catholic
archdiocese persuaded the city to approve a paltry 19 units of
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, huge new (non-affordable) housing developments are
spreading over the cornfields near Ventura's ranch. Rankled by what
he sees from his own back yard, the governor has strongly supported
commuter and light rail transport systems and endorsed, in June,
ten principles for development put forward by Minnesota's Smart
Growth Network.
</P>
<P>
   These included encouraging development in places already
equipped with roads and sewers, rather than in empty country;
providing a mixture of land uses, which might bring with it a
variety of housing and jobs; and promoting ``the revitalization of
existing urban and rural communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ventura has his opponents. Republicans in the state
legislature are suspicious of all these maneuvers and the
left-leaning groups that back them.
</P>
<P>
   They have succeeded in shutting down a fairly new advisory
council on community-based planning, and hope to keep their
opponents from ``densifying'' the outer-ring suburbs which,
increasingly, make up their core constituency.
</P>
<P>
   They do not deny the need for some planning, but are fearful of
what they see as social engineering. Let people live where they
like, they say. Do not force them into planned communities inspired
by some New Urbanist hallucination.
</P>
<P>
   As for the governor, a few local politicians wonder aloud why he
is willing to deny others the right to build on multiple-acre plots
while he enjoys his own. &QL;

   CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA. _ America's vacation season is off to a
strong start. With gasoline prices blissfully low, airline
companies fighting over fares and a general sense of economic
well-being, everything looks rosy.
</P>
<P>
   So why do Americans still seem to have such difficulty enjoying
their vacations?
</P>
<P>
   According to Cindy Aron, a history professor at the University
of Virginia, the answer lies in the past. Despite a dramatic
increase in leisure time since the mid-19th century, Americans are
simply hooked on their jobs. After all, neither they, nor their
country, got ahead by being idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans engaged in a love-hate battle with their vacations _
both wanting to take them and fearing the consequences,'' writes
Aron in ``Working at Play: A History of Vacations in the United
States'' (Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``Relaxing did not come easily to American men and women who
continued to use their leisure in the performance of various sorts
of work _ religious work, intellectual work, therapeutic work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leisure and labor remained complicated and troubling
categories, in some ways polar opposites, in other ways closely
connected.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 21st century this friction continues,
regardless of station or income.
</P>
<P>
   Media moguls hunt for deals at Herbert Allen's invitation-only
investment conference in the Rocky Mountain resort of Sun Valley,
Idaho. Companies of firemen from the Washington suburbs crowd into
rented accommodation on the Atlantic beaches of Delaware, where the
talk is of the station house rather than the surf.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Aron is immune. While working on her book, she took
along her portable computer to her family's annual retreat, a
waterfront house in New London, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   As she herself laments, ``Technology has made it too easy to
carry our work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Except to the very wealthy, who visited fashionable mountain
spas to escape the heat and disease of the cities, rest and
relaxation were mysteries to most Americans in the 1800s. A pause
from one's labors seemed to betray the Protestant ethic on which
the United States was founded.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1850s, as the word ``vacation'' first wormed its way
into the American lexicon, even spiritual leaders began to suggest
that leisure and relaxation could lead to God.
</P>
<P>
   From this, in short order, sprang the camp meetings: inexpensive
family getaways with a religious flavor, popular with blacks and
whites alike, in tiny communities that would become resorts in
their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a century ago, Rehoboth Beach, Del., was best known as
the site of an annual Methodist meeting. Now it is nicknamed ``the
Nation's Summer Capitol'' because of its popularity with Washington
power-brokers.
</P>
<P>
   One other vacation spot with roots in the 19th century clings to
its origins as a place of intellectual refreshment. At Chautauqua,
in upstate New York, members of the burgeoning middle class used to
attend concerts and talks on the social ills of the day; sometimes
they would study Greek, Latin and Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120 years later, Chautauqua still blends the
educational and recreational.
</P>
<P>
   It was at vacation spots that society's norms were tested and
changed. In the 19th century's posh resorts of the South and New
England, mixed-sex amusements included more than nightly
fancy-dress balls.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting a ``Venus Libitina'' emerging from the brine at
Virginia's Old Point Comfort, J.R.V. Daniels, a lawyer from
Richmond, huffed that ``society must throw her out.''
</P>
<P>
   But before long newspapers were feasting on similar antics of
the rich and celebrated, much as they feed today on the doings of
the glitterati who descend on the Hamptons of New York's Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Europeans increasingly consider vacations a right,
Americans still largely view leisure time as a privilege. Employers
are not required by law to provide vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Aron's research reveals that the company-sponsored summer break,
with pay, is a 20th-century phenomenon which, curiously, was
extended to most workers only during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The economic downturn cut into vacation spending, but it had
almost fully recovered by the mid-1930s. This was to hasten what
Aron describes as ``cross-class sharing of vacation experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Although racial and religious segregation was the rule, blacks
and Jews created resorts that were similar to those open only to
white Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Bluffs, a black vacation area on Martha's Vineyard, thrives
to this day, although the Jewish resorts in New York's Catskill
mountains have virtually disappeared, victims of assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   What has not changed is the pragmatic American approach to
vacations. The message to vacationers since the 19th century, Aron
writes, has been ``Take a vacation, relax and enjoy yourself; but
be wary of idleness and try to make your vacation a useful,
productive endeavor.''

 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two weeks ago, Sara Whalen played in the biggest game
of her life in front of 90,000 fans at the Rose Bowl. On Saturday,
she played on a much smaller stage, in front of fewer than 2,000
fans at North Hempstead Park.
</P>
<P>
   But Whalen doesn't see the shift from playing in the Women's
World Cup final in Pasadena, Calif., to playing in a
semiprofessional game in New Hyde Park, as a letdown. As one of the
younger members of the U.S. women's national team, she views
playing in the United Soccer League's W-League as a way to
strengthen her skills while earning some extra income.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of people watching the game has never been an issue
for me,'' said Whalen, 23, who was a reserve defender on the
national team. ``The W-League is less stressful, but it's important
to the players. Whether I'm playing in front of 90,000 people or
I'm playing in front of 10 people, the soccer part never changes. I
play because I love to play.''
</P>
<P>
   In the World Cup final against China, Whalen replaced the
injured Michelle Akers at the start of overtime and played solidly.
In the tournament, she played 165 minutes in the three matches, and
was a starter in a victory against North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of playing time for a reserve in the World Cup,
but I'm probably not as tired as the starters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night she made her season debut with the Long Island
Lady Riders, who are 9-4 over all and in first place in the North
Division. The Lady Riders, who won the league title in 1995 and
1997, played the Rochester Ravens at North Hempstead Park.
</P>
<P>
   Whalen, who is a native of Greenlawn, was an all-America player
at the University of Connecticut in 1995, 1996 and 1997. She first
joined the Lady Riders in 1997 and helped them to win their second
W-League title. She also played for the Lady Riders in 1998, but
because of her commitment to the national team this year, was
available to return to the Long Island team only after the World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 17 former or current national team players were in
the 5-year-old W-League _ the only national soccer league for
women. But during World Cup years, the majority of the team _ in
particular the star players like Akers, Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy,
Brandi Chastain and Briana Scurry _ take time off to recharge.
</P>
<P>
   This season, only a handful of national team players are in the
W-League: Whalen, Tracy Ducar and Cindy Parlow, both with the
Raleigh Wings, and Christie Pearce, with the New Jersey Lady
Stallions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of Sara's teammates, I'm sure, want to take some time
off, and that's understandable,'' said Chuck Jacob, owner of the
Lady Riders. ``But some players just like to play. In Sara's case,
she probably would have liked to play more during the World Cup. So
she's in shape and ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   As for watching one of his players celebrate the World Cup
championship, Jacob said: ``It was fantastic. What a thrill it was
to pick up Time Magazine last week and see Sara smack in the middle
of the cover. Though she might not have been the most pivotal
player, it was great. The whole Women's World Cup was a tremendous
boost for the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Whalen agreed. ``I think the one thing I've noticed the most is
that we're drawing a bigger scope of people,'' she said. ``We're
seeing 40-year-old men, crying with joy, with their two sons. I
think our team has done a lot for women's sports in general, not
just soccer. Look at all of the positive role models on the team.
Growing up, I couldn't have imagined this.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a chaotic month for Whalen. But it has also been one
that she says she will not forget. Since winning the cup, she and
her teammates have been given the VIP treatment, making stops in
Disney Land, New York City, the White House, Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
and back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great ride,'' said Whalen. ``We got to fly on
Hillary Clinton's jet, go to the White House and hang out with
Bill. I mean, what more can I say?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But now it's back to business. Whalen hopes to make the U.S.
Olympic team that will go to Sydney, Australia, for the 2000 Summer
Games. But being the last of the 20 players selected for the World
Cup team, and knowing that there are only 18 roster spots for the
Olympic squad, Whalen believes she has to work even harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel positive because I was playing first or second off the
bench against China, so I feel good about myself,'' Whalen said.
``I definitely feel that way. I was going through a tough time with
where my position was on the team, barely made the World Cup team.
I gained a lot of experience.''

   CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA. _ America's vacation season is off to a
strong start. With gasoline prices blissfully low, airline
companies fighting over fares and a general sense of economic
well-being, everything looks rosy.
</P>
<P>
   So why do Americans still seem to have such difficulty enjoying
their vacations?
</P>
<P>
   According to Cindy Aron, a history professor at the University
of Virginia, the answer lies in the past. Despite a dramatic
increase in leisure time since the mid-19th century, Americans are
simply hooked on their jobs. After all, neither they, nor their
country, got ahead by being idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans engaged in a love-hate battle with their vacations _
both wanting to take them and fearing the consequences,'' writes
Aron in ``Working at Play: A History of Vacations in the United
States'' (Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``Relaxing did not come easily to American men and women who
continued to use their leisure in the performance of various sorts
of work _ religious work, intellectual work, therapeutic work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leisure and labor remained complicated and troubling
categories, in some ways polar opposites, in other ways closely
connected.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 21st century this friction continues,
regardless of station or income.
</P>
<P>
   Media moguls hunt for deals at Herbert Allen's invitation-only
investment conference in the Rocky Mountain resort of Sun Valley,
Idaho. Companies of firemen from the Washington suburbs crowd into
rented accommodation on the Atlantic beaches of Delaware, where the
talk is of the station house rather than the surf.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Aron is immune. While working on her book, she took
along her portable computer to her family's annual retreat, a
waterfront house in New London, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   As she herself laments, ``Technology has made it too easy to
carry our work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Except to the very wealthy, who visited fashionable mountain
spas to escape the heat and disease of the cities, rest and
relaxation were mysteries to most Americans in the 1800s. A pause
from one's labors seemed to betray the Protestant ethic on which
the United States was founded.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1850s, as the word ``vacation'' first wormed its way
into the American lexicon, even spiritual leaders began to suggest
that leisure and relaxation could lead to God.
</P>
<P>
   From this, in short order, sprang the camp meetings: inexpensive
family getaways with a religious flavor, popular with blacks and
whites alike, in tiny communities that would become resorts in
their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a century ago, Rehoboth Beach, Del., was best known as
the site of an annual Methodist meeting. Now it is nicknamed ``the
Nation's Summer Capitol'' because of its popularity with Washington
power-brokers.
</P>
<P>
   One other vacation spot with roots in the 19th century clings to
its origins as a place of intellectual refreshment. At Chautauqua,
in upstate New York, members of the burgeoning middle class used to
attend concerts and talks on the social ills of the day; sometimes
they would study Greek, Latin and Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120 years later, Chautauqua still blends the
educational and recreational.
</P>
<P>
   It was at vacation spots that society's norms were tested and
changed. In the 19th century's posh resorts of the South and New
England, mixed-sex amusements included more than nightly
fancy-dress balls.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting a ``Venus Libitina'' emerging from the brine at
Virginia's Old Point Comfort, J.R.V. Daniels, a lawyer from
Richmond, huffed that ``society must throw her out.''
</P>
<P>
   But before long newspapers were feasting on similar antics of
the rich and celebrated, much as they feed today on the doings of
the glitterati who descend on the Hamptons of New York's Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Europeans increasingly consider vacations a right,
Americans still largely view leisure time as a privilege. Employers
are not required by law to provide vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Aron's research reveals that the company-sponsored summer break,
with pay, is a 20th-century phenomenon which, curiously, was
extended to most workers only during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The economic downturn cut into vacation spending, but it had
almost fully recovered by the mid-1930s. This was to hasten what
Aron describes as ``cross-class sharing of vacation experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Although racial and religious segregation was the rule, blacks
and Jews created resorts that were similar to those open only to
white Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Bluffs, a black vacation area on Martha's Vineyard, thrives
to this day, although the Jewish resorts in New York's Catskill
mountains have virtually disappeared, victims of assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   What has not changed is the pragmatic American approach to
vacations. The message to vacationers since the 19th century, Aron
writes, has been ``Take a vacation, relax and enjoy yourself; but
be wary of idleness and try to make your vacation a useful,
productive endeavor.''

   and dynamite production resumed.
</P>
<P>
   But explosives, which once employed thousands in Carthage, are a
dwindling part of the town's economy. The biggest employer is
Leggett &AMP; Platt, a furniture maker. The area's economy also is
increasingly dependent on visitors. And the two _ explosives and
tourism _ don't always get along.
</P>
<P>
   Carthage is probably best known for being home to the company
that sells those teardrop-eyed Precious Moments characters, which
are reproduced in porcelain figurines and on other products.
</P>
<P>
   The company draws 750,000 visitors a year to its chapel, which
it says was inspired by the Sistine Chapel. But at this chapel, the
biblical characters are replaced by Precious Moments characters.
</P>
<P>
   Precious Moments built the chapel on property that adjoins ICI,
the other explosives plant in Carthage. When ICI a few years ago
planned to build an incinerator to burn surplus explosives and
ammunition, Precious Moments sued and got an agreement on how the
incinerator would operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every reason to believe that the incinerator is
running in a perfectly proper fashion,'' said Ted Easley, a senior
project manager for Precious Moments.
</P>
<P>
   VanGilder, who has also written a history of the Carthage area,
says tourism will become even more important in the future. And
rather than being hidden, he said, the area's explosives industry
and the last dynamite plant in North America deserve to be part of
that heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be forgotten,'' he said.

DYNAMITE PRODUCTION A SOLID PART OF TOWN'S ECONOMY

 TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Mo. _ From its Victorian mansions to a Civil War
battlefield, this southwest Missouri town is steeped in history.
Even a chunk of Route 66 still gives off some kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Carthage's visitors bureau offers dozens of brochures about the
town's history and its attractions, including the nearby Precious
Moments chapel. But you'll find no mention of a group of buildings
on the city's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings are home to the last plant in North America that
makes dynamite _ the explosive that played such a crucial role in
this country's development that it has been called the single most
important engineering tool from the Civil War to the end of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Now dynamite is in the twilight of its career. The workhorse has
been displaced with cheaper and safer explosives. Dynamite
accounted for far less than 1 percent of the explosives used in the
United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   And as dynamite wanes, the circle is closing with a nod to the
explosive's heritage. The Carthage plant, in operation since early
in the century, is now owned by a company that traces its roots to
dynamite's inventor, Alfred Nobel. The company's name: Dyno Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legacy continues,'' said Paul Worsey, director of the
University of Missouri-Rolla's Explosive Research Center.
Dynamite's story began in the mid-1800s, when a new explosive was
needed to make coal and mineral mining and improvements such as
railroad tunnels economical and speedy.
</P>
<P>
   Black powder lacked the needed punch, and liquid nitroglycerin
was so unstable that hundreds of lives were lost in accidental
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden, Nobel came up with a solution: mix nitroglycerin with
an absorbent material to create a paste that could be shaped into
sticks of dynamite. The new explosive was far more stable than
nitroglycerin and packed the necessary wallop to cut through hard
rock. Nobel, whose explosives fortune would eventually finance the
Nobel Prizes, took out a patent in 1867.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did dynamite allow mining to flourish, it was at the
center of the country's most notable construction projects. Hoover
Dam, for instance, was completed in the 1930s after using 8 million
pounds of dynamite. The project wouldn't have happened without the
explosive, the dam's officials say.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, dynamite blew away rock to make way for the
system of interstate highways. The Alaska Pipeline used 36 million
pounds of the explosive in one of the last big projects in which
dynamite played a large role.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the going got tough, the tough used dynamite,'' said S.S.
Jenkins Jr., a Kansas City area resident with a 40-year career in
explosives and the author of a book about the explosives industry,
(begin ital.)Short Fuses(end ital.).
</P>
<P>
   Dynamite's popularity peaked in the 1950s. Since then it has
lost customers to newer explosives that are cheaper and safer. Out
of 6 billion pounds of explosives sold last year in the United
States, only 20 million pounds were dynamite, according to the
Institute of Makers of Explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't use dynamite for sentimental reasons,'' said Bob
Pilshaw, an Overland Park blasting consultant and a former
distributor of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the fading of dynamite isn't without some regrets.
Pilshaw's son, Russell, is a blasting contractor in Lawrence, Kan.,
and uses other explosives for most his work. He sees the day when
he won't have to use dynamite at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of sad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When that day is coming, no one will say for certain. Dyno
already makes other explosives at the Carthage plant. A Dyno
spokesman said that there was still a small market for dynamite and
that the company would supply it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time we're committed to fill the niche,'' said Brad
Larson, a Dyno spokesman in Oslo, Norway, the company's
headquarters. The company, which is the second-largest seller of
explosives in the world, operates one other dynamite plant, outside
Oslo. Dyno Nobel was established in 1865 by Alfred Nobel's
associate Carl Wennerstrom, who bought the Norwegian patent rights
for Nobel's methods for producing nitroglycerin. Later the company
began producing dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   The company squared its historical circle with Nobel in 1986
when it bought Nitro Nobel AB, the Swedish company Nobel founded in
1864 under the name Nitroglycerin Aktiebolag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make quite a bit of it. ...There's a huge debt owed to
Alfred Nobel,'' Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dyno came to Missouri in the mid-1980s, when it bought the
Carthage plant from another explosives manufacturer, continuing a
tradition from the early 1900s of making explosives in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the Carthage explosives factory supplied the region's
lead and zinc mines and marble quarries. By the early 1900s, the
area had four explosives plants. The mines and quarries have all
but disappeared, but the Nobel plant and one other explosives
factory remain.
</P>
<P>
   Today about 270 people work at the Dyno plant, which is known
for good wages and benefits. To get there they travel down a road
on the far outskirts of town, past Cloud's Meat Processing and the
company that makes Ott's salad dressing.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamite plant is surrounded by a chain-link fence to keep
unwanted visitors out. At a guardhouse, people are screened before
a gate is opened. Signs at the entrance warn that no smoking,
lighters, matches or other flame producing devices are permitted on
the grounds. ``No Hunting'' signs are planted around the property.
</P>
<P>
   Plant executives keep a low profile and rarely comment publicly
about operations. Area residents seem to take the plant in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad it's here; it's accepted,'' said Marjorie Bull, a
Carthage resident.
</P>
<P>
   But the coexistence isn't always peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago the plant was deemed one of the 50 worst water
polluters in the country. Company officials agreed to improve
wastewater treatment at the plant, which must use some powerful
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   In April a fire at the plant caused the evacuation of some
nearby homes. The fire was put out with no injuries or explosions.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the explosion on a July day in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told someone, `Listen to the thunder,' but I looked up and
there were no clouds,'' said Doris Wardlow, who was about 30 miles
away when the first explosion occurred.
</P>
<P>
   A truck had driven onto the dynamite plant's grounds with one of
its wheels on fire. The fire spread to some brush and then to the
plant and the bunkers where dynamite was stored.
</P>
<P>
   After the first explosion, Marvin VanGilder, then editor of
(begin ital.)The Carthage Press(end ital.), ran outside and saw a
mushroom cloud rising above the plant. Many in Carthage thought it
was a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 13 hours, six explosions leveled the plant and
caused damage to many parts of Carthage. Only one person was
killed, however, and three dozen residents suffered only minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a miracle,'' said VanGilder.

WOMAN DESCRIBES MOROCCAN KING AS BENEVOLENT AND CRUEL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS W. HAINES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Heads of state from Washington to the Middle East are
mourning the passing of Morocco's King Hassan II, praising him as a
broker of peace, a stabilizing force in a turbulent region.
</P>
<P>
   But few people have reacted to the news of Hassan's death as
personally as Malika Oufkir, a striking woman who has lived a
catalog of lives _ childhood palace harem member, 20-year prisoner,
expatriate in Paris _ at Hassan's whim.
</P>
<P>
   Oufkir, 46, recounted her travails earlier this year in ``La
Prisonniere,'' a memoir that hit Paris bestseller lists and shed
light on the darker side of life within Morocco's royal circle. Her
story details two nightmarish decades of imprisonment, many in
Morocco's southern desert, locked alongside her mother and five
siblings because her father, once a powerful Hassan ally, tried to
assassinate the king.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, sitting on the edge of a bed in the bright loft
designed by her husband, a Paris architect, Oufkir described the
emotional conflicts she still feels toward Hassan, a man criticized
for violating human rights to retain his power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I heard he was dead, it was sadness, because he
was my father, because I cannot forget my childhood. With him, he
took a part of my life,'' Oufkir said, speaking in English. ``Now,
it's la serenite, it's peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Oufkir's story has resounded so strongly here because it is has
universal elements of lost youth, of helplessness in the face of
power. Also, in a nation closely linked to Morocco _ France
colonized the country and controlled it until after World War II _
Oufkir's memoirs have given rare insight into the fantasy of life
inside Hassan's circle and the horror of life outside it.
</P>
<P>
   But Oufkir does not use her history as a political weapon,
railing against Hassan and his policies. As she speaks in calm,
measured tones, it is clear that to her, the journey is one of
personal understanding, of deciphering the intersections of her
life with Hassan's.
</P>
<P>
   When Oufkir was born, in 1954, her birth father, Mohammed
Oufkir, was becoming a powerful player within the monarchy. When
she was 5, Hassan's father adopted her into the palace, making her
a member of Hassan's personal harem.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, she lived a pampered life, sheltered
within the palace walls. Hassan, who succeeded to the throne in
1961, became the dominant man in her life, gentle and attentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only man I used to speak with and have a relationship with
was the king,'' she said. ``He was my father, and he was also the
king.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Oufkir wanted out, to return to her natural
family. Hassan granted her wish in 1970. For more than two years,
she reveled in a wealthy, fast-paced life, jetting to Hollywood to
pursue acting dreams, meeting Steve McQueen and other stars of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Her birth father had become one of Hassan's most powerful
lieutenants, rising to minister of defense. But privately, he was
one of Hassan's most potent opponents. In August 1972, Oufkir led
an attempt to assassinate Hassan as the king's personal jet
returned from Paris to Rabat, one of several attempts on the
monarch's life early in his reign.
</P>
<P>
   Oufkir's body was discovered later. The palace described the
death as a suicide, but multiple bullet wounds pierced the body.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, Malika Oufkir, her mother, five siblings,
and a cousin were imprisoned in the south Moroccan desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was when the nightmare began,'' Oufkir said.
</P>
<P>
   For a few years, the family was kept together. Eventually, they
were separated in another prison: damp cells, scarce food,
scorpions. No doctor. No books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years inside jail, without sun, without going outside,''
Oufkir said. In 1987, Oufkir, a sister, and two brothers tunneled
their way to freedom, only to be recaptured after weeks on the run.
International attention pressured Hassan to lighten their sentence
to house arrest. In 1991, the family, which had held together for
years, was released. In 1996, after more outside pressure, the
family was allowed to leave Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   With Hassan's son, King Mohamed VI, enthroned Saturday, Oufkir
seemed optimistic, hoping that he will bring better things to her
native country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you forgive, without forgetting, you can better
understand the future,'' she said. ``That's why I am looking
forward, and hope the Morocco of the future is a Morocco of
democracy and equality.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, on what turned out to be his final trip to
Paris, Hassan told a French interviewer he regretted the way Oufkir
and her family had been treated.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Oufkir some peace, but left one lingering question:
Why did Hassan, who showered affection on her when she was young,
take away her freedom for acts she did not commit?
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' she said, ``it is forever the only question without
answer.''

<P>
   The game is seven-card stud, high-low, white chips a quarter,
red and black a buck. Eight, nine, 10 balding and graying heads
crowd around the table every afternoon, here by the pool if it's
breezy or, when it gets sweaty hot, upstairs under an awning, with
an ocean view nobody bothers to look at.
</P>
<P>
   Cabana boys call it ``Grumpier Old Men, Part 3,'' and, like
actors on cue, the men argue about everything from how to deal the
cards to how to split the pot to how often to take ``latrine
calls.'' They grumble over what they've lost and what the others
have won, wondering, perhaps, what they are doing there, but never
thinking about not showing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here in the summertime; in the winter, I go to
Florida,'' says Bessen, 64, a retired jeweler. ``I don't golf. I
don't play tennis. I enjoy playing cards.''
</P>
<P>
   The Old Westbury is one of a dozen beach clubs that form a
Borscht Belt by the sea on a mile-long strip of sand just. Unlike
the dying resorts in the Catskills, the beach clubs, most built in
the 1930s, are thriving, filled with a new generation of toddlers
and their toys, even as old-timers like Dr. Murray Bookbinder, 94,
struggle to maneuver along the boards with their walkers.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to summer communities in the Hamptons or on Martha's
Vineyard, Atlantic Beach on the South Shore is a day-tripper's
domain: They come after lunch and leave before dinner, or start
with a swim at sunup and stay for sunset cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   They stream over Long Island's only toll bridge ($1.25 each way)
mostly from the neighboring Five Towns region, but also from
elsewhere in Nassau and Suffolk counties, and New York City.
(Residents of Atlantic Beach have a small patch of sand set aside,
but otherwise, access to the ocean is limited to club members.)
</P>
<P>
   Alyssa Mack Kuhn has moved to Springfield, Ill., but she and her
children stay with her parents all summer so they can be at the
corner cabana in the Catalina, where three generations of her
family have camped for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things we did as children, and these are things we
do with our children,'' says Mrs. Kuhn, 38, who has spent 33
summers kibitzing at the Catalina. ``I always knew I wanted to give
them what I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the clubs are as Jewish as Jerusalem, the Long Island
accents as thick as the humidity. They are places where everybody
knows your name (and, probably, your mother's), but members might
not recognize one another in street clothes rather than swimsuits.
</P>
<P>
   It is a family scene, with a startling number of stay-at-home
moms and only a handful of bankers on cellular phones. There are
lots of teachers on summer break and people who work in the garment
industry; the parking lot has as many sport utility vehicles as
Cadillacs. The younger women wear matching wrap miniskirts on top
of their swimsuits and carry Kate Spade bags; the older ones have
tissues sticking out of their tops.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, someone spreads a fresh coat of paint _ peach at
Sunny Atlantic, sea-foam green at the Catalina _ over everything in
sight. The rest is the same as it ever was.
</P>
<P>
   Women with fresh lipstick play mah-jongg, as their mothers did.
Men with clunky gold Stars of David around their necks play cards,
like their dads. And children play and play, splashing in kiddie
pools, safe in the sand courts surrounded by cul-de-sacs of
cabanas.
</P>
<P>
   Some stroll along the shore, some take a steam, some just sit
and schmooze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like camp for adults,'' says Ilene Pachtman, 45, sunning
herself at the Catalina. ``We're all really close. Which came
first, I don't know. We've always had the cabana.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabanas, small wooden cabins connected to one another, cost
$3,000 to $10,000 for the season, depending on the club and the
location, and most people split them among two or three families. A
cheaper choice is a locker, which has space to store things and to
change, but nowhere to hang out. Locker people usually stay by the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite a beach house, a cabana falls somewhere between a
large walk-in closet and a tiny Manhattan living room, but
nonetheless has touches of home. People display color-coordinated
plastic plates on shelves, and decorate the swinging wooden doors
to the two changing rooms with matching shelf paper. Most have
showers in the back, very few a toilet. Some clubs have cabanas
with electricity, and thus toasters, microwaves, refrigerators and
telephone lines. Once, someone put up a satellite dish to catch
MTV.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Martha Stewart-inspired cabana with wicker
wastebaskets, plastic flowers and country touches, and a nostalgic
one where a framed print of Frank Sinatra hangs above the full bar
with blender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you want to do,'' Paul Malkin, the 75-year-old owner
of the Sunny Atlantic, says as he shows off a locker festooned with
yellow-and-white wallpaper and a framed print. ``This is your home
away from home.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Like any community, the clubs, which range in size from the
intimate Sunny Atlantic, with 100 cabanas, to the sprawling Silver
Point, with 800, have their cliques.
</P>
<P>
   Old folks tend to gather by the pool, shaded by the awnings in
front of their cabanas, rarely stepping on sand. The bustling
neighborhood is the sand court, where cabana shelves are filled
with peanut butter and animal crackers rather than vodka and tonic,
and a mountain of plastic beach toys collects in the middle.
Upstairs, on what some clubs call the crow's nest, are the adults
who have older children, who are off at camps or summer jobs.
(There is virtually no one 10 to 18 at the clubs, and there are few
people in their 20s.)
</P>
<P>
   Along the beach, the colors of the umbrellas change from club to
club. Inside, each clapboard compound has a distinct character. The
Sun and Surf does not provide furniture but lets members remodel,
so the cabanas have built-in sinks and even bunk beds. The
brass-and-mirrors Sands offers a flea market of jewelry and gifts
on Wednesdays, and has a kosher caterer and three party rooms.
Silver Point is the largest and the cheapest.
</P>
<P>
   At the kitschy Catalina, members are sure the 1984 Matt Dillon
movie, ``The Flamingo Kid,'' was shot there. (Actually, it was at
the Silver Gull Beach Club on Breezy Point.) It may as well have
been.
</P>
<P>
   Water aerobics have replaced the movie's poolside dance classes,
and there is a cafeteria-style restaurant rather than the El
Flamingo's overflowing smorgasbord. But the cabana boys are every
bit as tan, and just as likely to have flirtatious middle-aged
women tucking dollars in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The cabana boy _ there seem to be only boys, though the rare
young woman gets a job as a parking valet _ is the essence of
beach-club culture. This is what makes members who cannot afford a
house in the Hamptons feel rich. When you're thirsty, just holler
his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a second, can I get iced tea the way I like it?''
Stephanie Schandler asks Asher Friend, 22, a cabana boy at the
Westbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know exactly what that means,'' Friend says, rushing for the
tea, with two lemons squeezed and four packets of Sweet 'n Low.
``There's a million little things that you kind of just have to
know. Let's say someone's allergic to pickles _ and I have that _
everything they have here comes with pickles. So I have to
remember, even though he doesn't tell me every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Spiegel, 22, started on the strip six years ago as a chair
boy, lugging 100 lounge chairs a day in hope of $1 tips. Now he is
head cabana boy at the Old Westbury, in charge of tending to the
Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry, I think I'm ready for a brew,'' says Skip Sturza, a
stack of chips in front of his ample belly. ``Give me a Chinese
brew.''
</P>
<P>
   The club does not keep cards on hand, which is why Spiegel once
spent a night running to five drugstores in search of the
jumbo-size Bicycle cards the Game requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are pretty demanding,'' Spiegel says. ``They're
harder than kids to take care of. They have to have their way.'' He
stops for a second. ``They're going to read that and kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   The women are a few cabanas away, deep in their own game at the
mah-jongg table. Most mah-jongg players are somebody's grandmother,
but four women in their late 30s, best friends who live in the Five
Towns, decided two years ago that it was time to learn the game
their mothers used to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rite of passage,'' says Debbie Zelvin of Woodmere,
getting ready to leave the club in time to meet the day-camp bus.
</P>
<P>
   At another mah-jongg game by the pool, where the most you can
lose in a day is $10, Charlotte Brust and her daughter, Ronnie
Soled, sit at the same table.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going to do in the city, sit on a bench?'' asks
Mrs. Brust, 76, who lives in Manhattan with her husband, Frank, a
staple of the poker game. ``We get here early, like 10 o'clock. We
stay here until 6, 7 o'clock. We find something to eat. By the time
we get home, it's time to go to bed already. We wake up and come
back the next day.''

 &HT;    Course favors Gordon
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ After a week off, NASCAR shifts into gear today
with the Pennsylvania 500.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Skinner is at the pole position for the 1:05 p.m. race. He
will share the front row with No. 2 qualifier Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Pocono is the site of a circuit race for the second time in five
weeks, with Bobby Labonte winning the Pocono 500 June 20. The track
is considered one of NASCAR's toughest because of its shape
(tri-oval) and distance (2.5 miles).
</P>
<P>
   ``This track is definitely unique,'' said Jeff Gordon, defending
Pennsylvania 500 champion.
</P>
<P>
   No one may know the tricky course better than Gordon, who starts
seventh. He has finished first or second in seven of the past eight
races at Pocono. His worst performance was a No. 7 finish in July
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Back on track
</P>
<P>
   The return to racing could not arrive any sooner for Winston Cup
points leader Dale Jarrett, who is ahead of Jeff Burton by 240
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to sit out last weekend, even though I enjoyed the
time off,'' Jarrett said. ``When things are going well, you want to
race again as soon as you possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   For Martin, the bye was a blessing as he continues to heal from
a crash at Daytona July 2. Martin tore up his left knee, fractured
his left wrist and broke a rib.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a whole lot better shape now,'' Martin said. ``I don't
anticipate me having any physical problems for this race. But New
Hampshire (two weeks ago) was a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie problems
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Sadler may be wondering if there is a curse following
him at Pocono. The rookie blew two engines during practice Friday.
Sadler lost a third engine Saturday when he crashed into a wall
during second-round qualifying. He damaged his left foot in the
wreck, but an examination revealed no break.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has probably been the worst weekend of racing I've ever
had,'' Sadler said. ``I don't know why, but everything seems to be
going wrong so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler was forced to use a provisional for today's race.
However, Morgan Shephard is hanging around in case Sadler opts to
pull out. Shephard missed the cut during both rounds of qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   In the field
</P>
<P>
   Former Hollywood stuntman Stanton Barrett had the fastest time
(167.532 mph) during the final round of qualifying. Barrett will be
making his second NASCAR start after finishing 30th in the Las
Vegas.

 &HT;    All's not Wells with NASCAR
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ Cal Wells has never fielded a car in a NASCAR
race, but the California businessman already has secured two of the
sport's top sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, 43, and his company, Precision Preparation Inc., have
shaken NASCAR's good ol' boy network the past two months, securing
the deep pockets of fast-food giant McDonald's and Procter &AMP;
Gamble's Tide brand for a future NASCAR operation.
</P>
<P>
   After the corporations announced they wouldn't renew their
sponsorships with veterans Bill Elliott and Ricky Rudd, Wells
became perhaps the most hated man in the garage. And he can expect
a cold shoulder when his team debuts at Daytona International
Speedway next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got some guy that's come in here and back-doored them
on their sponsors,'' Terry Labonte said. ``I wouldn't know the guy
if he walked through the door. The guy's got to be one hell of a
salesman to sell a team that he doesn't even have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As an owner, you put your heart and soul into it,'' said Read
Morten of Columbus, one of three owners of Ernie Irvan's No. 36
Pontiac. ``But this guy makes an offer these sponsors can't refuse.
If he thinks he's going to be welcomed here, he's mistaken. He's
sure not welcome here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who owns a two-car CART team, a two-car Formula Atlantic
operation and an off-road team, signed a five-year contract with
McDonald's and is expected to get a similar deal from Tide.
</P>
<P>
   Wells says he isn't surprised by the reaction of other owners
and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I've got to earn my way in, like any other new guy
on the block,'' Wells said. ``I know it's going to be tough. There
certainly seems to be a perception that we've disrupted the
constant in the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a lot of guys that have come in from other
disciplines of racing. They weren't all born in North Carolina. I
think once people get to know me, that perception will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells is expected to field a Busch Grand National team with
McDonald's next season, and jump to Winston Cup in 2001. However,
he could go straight into Winston Cup racing with Tide next year.
</P>
<P>
   Wells insists he didn't steal the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're involved in a number of motorsports disciplines,'' he
said. ``You meet a lot of people. ... Often one conversation can
lead to another. We were approached by both groups and we were able
to provide the operations both groups were looking for.

IN BRONX, GORE HAILS HOSPITAL FOR ITS WORK ON ASTHMA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to DELETE photo note)  (js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vice President Al Gore made a campaign stop Saturday
in the Bronx, where he broke ground for a new children's hospital
being built at Montefiore Medical Center and called attention to
the links between poverty, pollution and the health of young
people.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the leading contender for the Democratic presidential
nomination next year, cemented his ties with local Democratic
officials and hailed the new hospital as a model for children's
hospitals across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The new hospital will have a comprehensive program to treat
children with asthma. Gore said that the asthma hospitalization
rate for children in the Bronx is five times the normal rate.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Hospital at
Montefiore, said that ``38 percent of children in New York City
homeless shelters have asthma, the highest percentage in the
world.'' Among the causes, he said, are stress, overcrowding and
``environmental factors that we do not fully understand.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore was in the city, the presumptive front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
appeared upstate in Cooperstown, accompanying the former Texas
Ranger pitcher Nolan Ryan, who is being inducted into the Baseball
Hall of Fame. Bush used to own an interest in the team.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the White House has emphasized childhood asthma as an
example of the effect of poverty and pollution on public health,
and New York City has been used before to make a political point of
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, long before she became a contender for the New
York Senate seat, Hillary Rodham Clinton visited the South Bronx to
help start a childhood asthma initiative in the city. This January,
she introduced the administration's $68 million national program to
fight childhood asthma, the largest federal program ever to address
the problem, which affects about 6 million children.
</P>
<P>
   According to the administration, more than 100,000 children are
hospitalized each year because of asthma, making it the leading
cause of hospitalization due to chronic illness for children, at a
cost of $1.9 billion in medical expenses annually.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has cited asthma, which is aggravated by
inhaling smog, as a reason to tighten air quality standards under
rules that industry groups have successfully challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Gore announced that the federal government was
adopting a new air quality index to be used by local weather
forecasters across the country. The new index is based on levels of
smog, soot, carbon monoxide and other pollutants, he said, and it
will, for the first time, recommend specific precautions for people
with respiratory ailments like asthma.
</P>
<P>
   The original air quality index was introduced in 1976 and has
not been updated in more than 20 years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The vice president became interested in Montefiore through his
friendship with Carl Sagan, the astronomer and successful
popularizer of science, who died in 1996. Friends of Sagan are
working with Montefiore to establish a rooftop planetarium and
observatory for children at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will allow children of the Bronx to receive unparalleled
care in an inspirational environment,'' Gore said. ``Every child
can chase the stars, feel loved and connected and be able to live
out his or her dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Redlener, touching on another of the administration's favorite
themes, estimated that there were 300,000 uninsured children in New
York City, including 80,000 to 100,000 in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The new hospital, on Bainbridge Avenue in the Norwood section,
will be affiliated with Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

REFORM PARTY CONVENTIONEERS CONSIDER FUTURE WITHOUT PEROT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ With disarray in their ranks, leaders of the
Reform Party Saturday struggled at their annual convention to
restore power and relevance to their maverick movement, as they
pondered a possible future without H. Ross Perot at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the fiercest challenge yet to Perot's leadership, the Texas
billionaire's top aide, Russell E. Verney, said Perot is ready to
relinquish his grip on the party if the delegates want change at
the top.
</P>
<P>
   Verney himself is stepping aside after running the party for
Perot since he founded it in 1995. ``I think they are at the point
where they are ready to blossom,'' Verney said of a new wave of
Reform Party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes amid pressure from the party's new star, Jesse
Ventura, the former professional wrestler who shocked the political
establishment last year by winning the Minnesota governorship as a
Reform candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's forces, deployed en masse at the 332-delegate
conclave, were maneuvering on several fronts to block Perot from
heading the Reform Party's presidential ticket in 2000. Although
the nominee will not be chosen until next year, delegates approved
rule changes Saturday to loosen Perot's lock on the party
apparatus, and Perot's clout could be further diminished when
national officers are elected Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, who has pumped $72 million of his fortune into the
third-party movement, stunned both major parties by winning nearly
20 percent of the presidential vote in 1992. But he garned only 8.5
percent in 1996, and many of his longtime supporters believe his
time has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe him an enormous debt for getting us this far,'' said
Jack Gargan, Ventura's choice to replace Verney as national
chairman. ``Now it's time for him to turn the party over to us, to
let the birdie out of the nest and watch us fly.''
</P>
<P>
   The push for Perot to step aside came amid a virtual
free-for-all in the early race for the party's presidential
nomination _ and the $12.6 million in federal matching funds that
accompanies the prize.
</P>
<P>
   With the two major parties watching warily, fearful that a
Reform candidate could sway the outcome of next year's presidential
race, there were booths, buttons, billboards, bumper stickers, and
bands of delegates promoting nearly every conceivable nominee in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Draft efforts were underway for, among others, Colin Powell,
Patrick Buchanan, Donald Trump, Ralph Nader, Ted Turner, and three
former senators: Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, Sam Nunn of
Georgia, and David Boren of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Although some delegates wore ``Ross is Right for President in
2000'' buttons, Beverly Kidder of Princeton, N.J., expressed the
sentiments of many Reform Party members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ross is more comfortable in business,'' Kidder said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the leadership battle and the frenzy to draft new faces for
2000 reflected the restlessness within much of the movement for
change. And Ventura recently raised the stakes by saying a Perot
candidacy in 2000 would be ``borderline ridiculous'' and by
suggesting he would quit the party if Gargan was not elected.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the battle between Gargan and candidates loyal to
Perot was growing increasingly nasty, as both sides accused each
other of jeopardizing the party's future. There were
unsubstantiated charges of irregularities in the election process
and infighting that was uncharacteristic of the movement's
grass-roots activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is not always pretty, and this is one of those times
when it isn't,'' said Patricia Benjamin, Gargan's leading opponent,
who is seen as a Perot ally. ``Everybody is going in a different
direction. But hopefully we'll all end up in the same place at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the acrimony, many delegates said they think the party
could be dangerously riven if the skirmish is not resolved before
the convention ends Sunday. ``This is a critical time for us,''
said Donna Donovan of Glastonbury, Conn. ``We absolutely have to
look like we have our act together when we come out of this
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is formidable since Perot and Ventura aren't
talking to each other and had no plans to appear together during
the event. Perot was scheduled to address the delegates Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's Massachusetts chairman, Andy Lizotte of
Milford, said he wished ``everybody would take a step back'' from
the ``grudge match'' for the good of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte said party members ``are realistic enough to see the
numbers and recognize that Ross Perot would have a very difficult
time winning'' in 2000.

30TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATED WITH NEW MUSIC, YOUNGER CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ As the crowd grew to an estimated 220,000 people,
Woodstock '99 endured the ups and downs of any city Saturday. The
festival's first birth was recorded, but so was its first death _
suffered by a 44-year-old Massachusetts man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died of a heart attack, and we understand that he had a
preexisting condition,'' said New York State Police Major James
Parmley. The man's name was withheld pending notification of his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Woodstock '99 functioned without the serious traffic
problems and rainstorms that plagued Woodstock '69 and Woodstock
'94.
</P>
<P>
   The police contingent of 550 officers have made what Parmley
admits are remarkably few arrests (15 since the festival began
Thursday, five of those on drug-related charges).
</P>
<P>
   The most serious problem has been the intense summer heat
(temperatures hit the high 80s Saturday), which has resulted in
about 1,000 revelers being treated for heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, this 30th anniversary of Woodstock, which cost $35
million to stage at the decommissioned Griffiss Air Force base,
continues to impress authorities and fans alike at how well it's
going.
</P>
<P>
   When producers Michael Lang and John Scher held a press
conference Saturday, the biggest question was the amount of nudity
on site. That nudity has been particularly prevalent on the
three-day pay-per-view broadcast emanating from these hot, dusty
airport runways, with three stages and hundreds of food vendors
(and three beer gardens) in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going so well that you guys are really digging
for something,'' Lang said to the reporters who asked about nudity.
``The body is a beautiful thing,'' added Scher. ``And anyone
watching the pay-per-view has been warned that it would be
uncensored. All the promotions said that.''
</P>
<P>
   The nudity was still restricted to a minority of the
concertgoers _ and some defended it as perfectly appropriate,
especially given the history of Woodstock events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This festival is for people who need to get away from the
stress of their daily life and just go for it,'' said Kiri Jewell,
18, who drove here with a group of friends from Michigan State
University. ``It's OK to dance and get naked. It's all about being
comfortable with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some links to the past, this Woodstock resembled the
original mainly in name. None of the performers at the first
Woodstock were invited, and this year's event was clearly aimed at
an audience that wasn't even born in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   It was also aimed at reviving the economy of this desolate
upstate New York area, hard-hit by the closing of the air base,
which had employed 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodstock is worth $30 million to this region,'' said Rome
Mayor Joseph Griffo, who is often referred to as ``the Rock 'n'
Roll Mayor.'' He then excused himself to go hear the Dave Matthews
Band, which drew the largest crowd of the day, with fans spread out
as far as the eye could see from the towering, nine-story-high East
Stage, as sound boomed across the tarmac, carried by numerous
stacks of speakers stationed at various points well into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans were still recovering from a high-energy Friday night,
when the band Korn played an industrial-strength, metal-rap set,
followed by Britain's Bush, which didn't finish until after
midnight. And then came an all-night ``rave'' in one of the
abandoned airplane hangars, as techno DJ Moby fired up the crowd in
the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DJ is the global youth ambassador _ and this is the techno
generation,'' said Matt E. Silver, who produced the ``rave,'' which
he preferred to call a ``DJ Culture'' night.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's music had the afternoon highlights of Kid Rock (whose
assistant wore a Jimi Hendrix wig in a nod to the original
Woodstock), punk-rockers Everclear, hippie icon Bruce Hornsby (who
offered new, bluegrass reworkings of some of his songs), and
Matthews. Due to come were Alanis Morissette, Rage Against the
Machine, and Metallica. Woodstock concludes Sunday.

 &HT;    Sports-crazy Lee drops by convention

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Spike Lee didn't have a table set up, but he signed
his share of autographs walking station-to-station Saturday
afternoon at the National Sports Collectors Convention at the
Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   The director of ``Summer of Sam,'' was here to visit his
grandmother, Zimmi Shelton, who lives in southwest Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not doing well,'' Lee said. ``I had to come see her.''
</P>
<P>
   The Morehouse alum was also at the convention, which runs
through today, to add to his own sports momentos, which include
items from Michael Jordan and jerseys worn by Jackie Robinson and
Satchel Paige.

   Pamela Anderson really has no connection to sports, that is,
unless you count swimming, which she did in the series,
``Baywatch.'' But there was no doubt that with sports heavyweights
like Joe Montana, Carl Yastrzemski and Joe Frazier here for the
convention, she was the biggest draw Saturday.
</P>

PEACEKEEPERS STRUGGLE TO PROTECT REMAINING SERBS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BUDAPEST _ A brutal massacre of 14 Serb farmers in Kosovo
prompted the region's chief war crimes investigator to launch a
probe Saturday _ the only known inquiry into an attack on Serbs in
Kosovo in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   International leaders charged with keeping the fragile peace in
Kosovo condemned the attack on the farmers, who were apparently
ambushed and gunned down at close range as they were harvesting
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Arbour, who has presided over numerous other Kosovo war
crimes inquiries into violence against ethnic Albanians, said she
was alarmed at the scale of Friday night's attack on the Serbs _
the deadliest retaliatory violence since the war ended. ``The
strongest deterrent message must be sent to those who are inclined
to perpetuate the cycle of violence that has shattered Kosovo in
the last year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from a vague plan to step up protection in some areas,
there is little NATO troops can do to stop the series of revenge
killings and expulsions against Serbs by embittered Albanians, the
officials conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a reality that KFOR,'' the peacekeeping force assigned
to patrol Kosovo since mid-June, ``cannot be everywhere all the
time,'' Lieutenant General Michael Jackson told reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will leave no stone unturned to get hold of the
murderers . . . and bring security to all the people of Kosovo,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's massacre was the worst single episode of violence since
the war ended. British troops who sped to the scene in Gracko, a
village near the provincial capital of Pristina, said they found 13
men lying dead in a corn and wheat field, with a 14th Serbian
farmer slumped dead on a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   The troops had been in Gracko, a mainly Serb village, just hours
before the assault, said Colonel Robin Hodges, a spokesman for the
British peacekeeping contingent.
</P>
<P>
   The episode upsets what peacekeeping officials maintained had
been a gradually improving environment in Kosovo. It also angered
Serb officials and residents who fear the Western military forces _
which bombed the Serbs for nearly three months _ are not committed
to protecting Serb civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The ``serious crime questions the seriousness of the cooperation
between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and KFOR,'' Nebojsa
Vujovic, the chief liaison with KFOR and NATO, told the state-run
Tanjug news agency. Vujovic called the murders ``the heaviest crime
against humanity by blind and bloodthirsty killers who are trying
to deprive Kosovo Serbs of their right to live and survive.''
</P>
<P>
   KFOR has no suspects yet, but the Kosovo Liberation Army has
denied responsibility. ``We do not know who did it, and I sincerely
believe these people have nothing to do with the KLA,'' said KLA
General Agim Ceku.
</P>
<P>
   KFOR is increasing its presence in Gracko and ``certain other
areas,'' said spokesman Roger Atkinson. The British troops have
``reassessed'' the level of threat for the area of Gracko, Hodges
said.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Gracko was evaluated as an area that needed troops
to cruise by every two or three days to remind locals that they are
there, Hodges said. Now, Gracko needs the more frequent presence of
``deterrence'' forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the peacekeepers' verbal commitment to evenhanded
patrolling of the region, both Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo
complain that KFOR _ the only internationally recognized authority
to keep order in the province _ has done little to prevent or
punish episodes of violence and looting.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a local police force and courts has left a vacuum of
power and of order in Kosovo, creating a free-for-all atmosphere
for both Albanians and Serbs bent on revenge, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are burning Serb houses. Sometimes, there are Albanian
houses in the row, and they get burned, too,'' said a 30-year-old
ethnic Albanian man who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians who had learned to live with Serbs under
political repression now say they cannot stomach sharing land with
people whose government orchestrated the deaths of an estimated
10,000 Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is just with the Serbs. Not the Serbian
government, but the Serbian people,'' said Asim Kasmi, 23, of the
western city of Pec.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly every Serb did something, even just a little,'' added
Mantor Kassapolli, 23. ``We didn't look at it this way before,'' he
said. ``But they gave us a reason now.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs who have not fled the area have found themselves an
endangered minority _ facing the same threat of assault, murder,
and forced eviction their Albanian neighbors did just months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's government estimates that at least 100,000 Serbs _
more than half the ethnic Serb population in Kosovo _ have been
intimidated into leaving Kosovo for upper Serbia. The UN High
Commissioner for Refugees does not dispute that estimate.
</P>
<P>
   But KFOR appears as helpless to prevent the crimes against Serbs
as international forces were to protect Albanians a year ago, when
the ethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosovo began escalating.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just lined up and gunned down,'' a devastated Zivane
Nderkovic said of the 14 murdered Friday, two of whom were his
sons. ``They were just bringing in the grain. It's a shame that the
world helps only Albanians, not Serbs,'' Nderkovic told Reuters.

SERB OPPOSITION LEADER CRITICIZES NATO FORCES IN KOSOVO  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for rally having taken place; refinements)   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIS, Yugoslavia _ A leading Serbian opposition leader, Vuk
Draskovic, made an emotional attack on NATO forces on Saturday,
saying they had allowed the ethnic purging of Serbs from Kosovo and
the creation of an Albanian state in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a rally of some 25,000 supporters here, he condemned
the killing of 14 Serbian farmers in the Kosovo village of Gracko.
He said the incident would promote anti-Western feelings in Serbia
and hurt the political opposition to President Slobodan Milosevic
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking into English, Draskovic appealed to the American people
``to stop, please, with the collective punishment of the Serbian
people and to stop supporting the project of a Greater Albania in
the Balkans.'' He said a Kosovo that was deprived of its ethnic mix
under NATO control would undermine the fundamentals of the American
commitment to a ``multi-ethnic, multi-racial'' state that protects
the rights of all citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm indicting KFOR and the United Nations mission in Kosovo
for the massacre that has happened,'' he said after the rally,
using the initials for the Kosovo peacekeeping force and echoing a
similar statement made by Milosevic. ``Gangs and bandits committed
crimes against Albanians in the name of the Serbian people. And
now, when Albanians commit crimes against Serbs, no one is against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech, Draskovic blamed Milosevic for the tragedy of
Kosovo, which has a strong emotional and religious pull on Serbs,
and for everything else that has gone wrong in Yugoslavia for the
last 10 years, as his supporters shouted, ``Slobo, resign!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilty or not,'' Draskovic shouted, ``the interests of the
nation require you to give up your armchair and resign!''
</P>
<P>
   But this will be Draskovic's last mass rally for some time,
senior aides said Saturday, because they believe that the moment is
not yet ripe for ousting Milosevic. Such a conclusion could fuel
speculation among Draskovic's rivals in the Serbian opposition that
all he actually wants is to replace Milosevic, rather than really
change Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said they believed that the opposition was wasting
energy by holding an endless series of summertime rallies that were
not attracting enough people to put any real pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic must go, Draskovic believes, but he must be induced to
go in a way that avoids civil conflict and significant bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   His aides say he will hold no more meetings for at least several
weeks, although the other main opposition grouping, the Alliance
for Change, has scheduled further rallies and hopes to lead a grand
march on Belgrade in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one says Milosevic must go,'' a senior Draskovic aide
said. ``But how? He doesn't even contemplate going. You can ask him
to go for 1,000 days, but asking him isn't serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic will resume mass meetings as an important part of the
strategy to get Milosevic to resign, ``but we want to pick the
right moment, when we can create momentum and there is something
important to say,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic is concentrating instead on trying to choose a
transitional government of experts agreed on by most or all
opposition parties, and then trying to push Milosevic to empower
that government and finally to step aside after new elections.
</P>
<P>
   That too has prompted other opposition leaders to suspect that
Draskovic wants only to replace Milosevic with himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Change demands Milosevic's resignation first,
before any transitional government. Under pressure from American
and European diplomats, however, Draskovic and alliance leaders are
working on a joint platform as a way to bridge their differences,
if not to solve them all. That platform will include the idea of
Milosevic's ouster and of new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic and the Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic, who
were allies in the 1996-97 marches against Milosevic, are now
bitter rivals, which has undermined both of their reputations and
the credibility of the opposition generally.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and the Serbian opposition are also hoping that
Milosevic's government will begin to crumble from within,
particularly if there are new indictments of those close to
Milosevic from the international tribunal on war crimes in The
Hague. Milosevic and four of his closest aides were indicted in
late May on charges of war crimes for their role as commanders of
Serbian forces that killed Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Indictments may come soon of Mirjana Markovic, Milosevic's wife
and the leader of the party that partners his in government, and of
Vojislav Seselj, the ultranationalist leader of the Radical Party
and a Serbian deputy prime minister, American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The officials and the opposition are hopeful that the former
army chief of staff, Momcilo Perisic, who came out this past week
in sharp opposition to Milosevic and the government, will attract
more army and police support to the idea of the president's ouster.
But Perisic is likely to form his own party, given his lack of
respect for Draskovic, Djindjic or another former general, Vuk
Obradovic, who heads the Social Democracy Party.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and its European partners will also resume aid to
independent media and opposition parties here, buying the argument
that there will be no ouster of Milosevic otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are pushing a revered economist, Dragoslav
Avramovic, who helped end Yugoslav hyperinflation in January 1994,
as a uniting figure for the opposition and even as prime minister
of a transitional Serbian government. Draskovic said Saturday night
that the transitional government of experts should be nonpartisan
and nonpolitical, and that its members should vow not to seek
elected office.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic believes that it is not yet the right time to name
such a government, his aides said. And he believes that the
opposition is dissipating anger at Milosevic by rallies now that
have no idea except Milosevic's ouster and that offer no serious
alternative program for citizens to unite behind.
</P>
<P>
   The main tasks of the transitional federal and Serbian
governments would be to restore diplomatic and economic ties with
the West, to prepare for free and fair elections monitored by
outsiders and ``to stop the genocide of the Serbian people,''
Draskovic said at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, a nationalist, believes that the West is harming the
opposition cause by allowing the majority Albanians to sweep most
of the Serbian minority from Kosovo through intimidation and
killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now no border with Albania, but they make only a
Serbian-Kosovo border,'' he said of NATO. ``Albanian criminal gangs
go over to burn Serbian churches and the roots of our religion,
raping Serbs and kidnapping them and burning their houses. If KFOR
came to protect innocent Albanians, who will now help the Serbs?''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Draskovic said, ``Our friends in the U.S. and
European Union, through their support to Albanian terrorists, are
supporting Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   There are growing feelings in Serbia that NATO and the West are
not serious about protecting the rights of all the citizens of
Kosovo, including the Serbs. NATO and the United Nations have been
slow to start policing the province in earnest, the Serbs feel, and
government officials have started to suggest that the Yugoslav
police and even army troops should return to Kosovo if such
killings continue.

30TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATED WITH NEW MUSIC, YOUNGER CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ As the crowd grew to an estimated 220,000 people,
Woodstock '99 endured the ups and downs of any city Saturday. The
festival's first birth was recorded, but so was its first death _
suffered by a 44-year-old Massachusetts man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died of a heart attack, and we understand that he had a
preexisting condition,'' said New York State Police Major James
Parmley. The man's name was withheld pending notification of his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Woodstock '99 functioned without the serious traffic
problems and rainstorms that plagued Woodstock '69 and Woodstock
'94.
</P>
<P>
   The police contingent of 550 officers have made what Parmley
admits are remarkably few arrests (15 since the festival began
Thursday, five of those on drug-related charges).
</P>
<P>
   The most serious problem has been the intense summer heat
(temperatures hit the high 80s Saturday), which has resulted in
about 1,000 revelers being treated for heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, this 30th anniversary of Woodstock, which cost $35
million to stage at the decommissioned Griffiss Air Force base,
continues to impress authorities and fans alike at how well it's
going.
</P>
<P>
   When producers Michael Lang and John Scher held a press
conference Saturday, the biggest question was the amount of nudity
on site. That nudity has been particularly prevalent on the
three-day pay-per-view broadcast emanating from these hot, dusty
airport runways, with three stages and hundreds of food vendors
(and three beer gardens) in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going so well that you guys are really digging
for something,'' Lang said to the reporters who asked about nudity.
``The body is a beautiful thing,'' added Scher. ``And anyone
watching the pay-per-view has been warned that it would be
uncensored. All the promotions said that.''
</P>
<P>
   The nudity was still restricted to a minority of the
concertgoers _ and some defended it as perfectly appropriate,
especially given the history of Woodstock events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This festival is for people who need to get away from the
stress of their daily life and just go for it,'' said Kiri Jewell,
18, who drove here with a group of friends from Michigan State
University. ``It's OK to dance and get naked. It's all about being
comfortable with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some links to the past, this Woodstock resembled the
original mainly in name. None of the performers at the first
Woodstock were invited, and this year's event was clearly aimed at
an audience that wasn't even born in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   It was also aimed at reviving the economy of this desolate
upstate New York area, hard-hit by the closing of the air base,
which had employed 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodstock is worth $30 million to this region,'' said Rome
Mayor Joseph Griffo, who is often referred to as ``the Rock 'n'
Roll Mayor.'' He then excused himself to go hear the Dave Matthews
Band, which drew the largest crowd of the day, with fans spread out
as far as the eye could see from the towering, nine-story-high East
Stage, as sound boomed across the tarmac, carried by numerous
stacks of speakers stationed at various points well into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans were still recovering from a high-energy Friday night,
when the band Korn played an industrial-strength, metal-rap set,
followed by Britain's Bush, which didn't finish until after
midnight. And then came an all-night ``rave'' in one of the
abandoned airplane hangars, as techno DJ Moby fired up the crowd in
the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DJ is the global youth ambassador _ and this is the techno
generation,'' said Matt E. Silver, who produced the ``rave,'' which
he preferred to call a ``DJ Culture'' night.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's music had the afternoon highlights of Kid Rock (whose
assistant wore a Jimi Hendrix wig in a nod to the original
Woodstock), punk-rockers Everclear, hippie icon Bruce Hornsby (who
offered new, bluegrass reworkings of some of his songs), and
Matthews. Due to come were Alanis Morissette, Rage Against the
Machine, and Metallica. Woodstock concludes Sunday.

HIGH MARKS FOR ECONOMY AT MIDTERM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. economy at midyear seems poised to continue growing
well into next year, which would make it the longest economic
expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
   All the keys to continued growth are in place. Meanwhile, few
analysts foresee anything on the horizon with the potential to
seriously undermine America's prosperity in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Even developments considered by some as bad news have a
good-news aspect. The recently reported May trade deficit, for
instance, was a record $21.3 billion, which topped the previous
high by well over $2 billion. As bad as this shortfall may have
seemed, however, it was a dramatic indicator of how much stronger
the U.S. economy is relative to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists estimate the rising trade deficits will tamp
second-quarter growth, and they are revising their forecasts of
gross domestic product to an annual rate of 3 percent or less for
the April-June period. Nevertheless, this also is good news because
slower growth means the Federal Reserve will be less inclined to
further tighten monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fed recently nudged one of its key rates up
slightly, it has maintained generous monetary growth, which has
been the booster fuel for the economy and stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The steady rise of the Index of Leading Economic Indicators,
which is a predictor of economic activity three to nine months
hence, makes it likely the expansion will set a record early next
year by surpassing the duration of the 1960s boom. Since the stock
market is not only a key leading indicator but also a prime source
of consumer confidence, Wall Street's fortunes probably will
determine how much longer prosperity will continue after the record
is set.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more than two-thirds of the investment advisory crowd
is bullish, which is a modestly bearish sign. It's not, however, a
number reflective of mindless euphoria. An example of market
restraint would be its reaction to a gangbusters second-quarter
earnings report by General Motors. GM stock fell nearly 2 points on
the news, which some analysts attributed to expectations of a
softer domestic market next year.
</P>
<P>
   The mood thus would seem cautiously optimistic, which is
justified, given what's in place. The Fed shows no sign of turning
off the money spigot, and consumer spending remains strong, which
is vital because two-thirds of economic growth is the result of
personal consumption. There are even signs that the economies of
key overseas trading partners are beginning to recover from the
global downturn that began two years ago in Asia. Even Japan is
apparently perking up after spending most of the '90s in the
doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   If the foreign resurgence is for real, it would probably mean a
badly needed boost for the manufacturing sector in the
not-too-distant future. Foreign economic problems have hit U.S.
manufacturers particularly hard as troubled countries have curbed
imports while stepping up exports to America to rejuvenate their
ailing economies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy is locked in a virtual circle: A rising stock
market feeds the consumer confidence that boosts consumption, which
fuels the expanding economy that encourages optimistic investors to
continue to bid up stock prices.

FAN DIES OF HEART ATTACK AS HEAT HITS WOODSTOCK  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ Unrelenting heat claimed a victim at Woodstock '99
when a 44-year-old Massachusetts man suffered a heart attack at the
concert Friday night and died, New York State Police officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, whose name was being withheld by the police Saturday
afternoon, had undergone a heart operation just 11 days ago and
chose to attend the three-day concert against the advice of
doctors, said Maj. James Parmley of the State Police.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday night, a female fan went into labor on the
grounds of the former Griffiss Air Force Base, where the concert is
being staged, and was taken to a city hospital. But concert
officials said they did not know Saturday if the woman had given
birth.
</P>
<P>
   As some of the most popular acts took the stage Saturday,
including the Dave Matthews Band and Limp Bizkit, the mood inside
the 1,100-acre concert site _ a sprawling and increasingly
garbage-caked theme park of food and shopping booths, cash machines
and nonstop music _ remained peaceful. In such heat, getting rowdy
is tough going.
</P>
<P>
   The mercury in thermometers appeared to be stuck in the high
80s, reducing all but the most energetic of the 200,000 fans to
laconic shade-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not observed that many offenses,'' Parmley said. ``The
attitude of the concertgoers is excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the concert weekend began on Friday, the police have made
15 arrests, 5 for drug possession and 10 for driving offenses,
Parmley said. The police have stayed out of the concert site
itself, though, leaving clusters of young people free to sit and
smoke marijuana. One fan was sent on his way Friday night when he
climbed into the back of a State Police cruiser, apparently
mistaking it for a taxi, and asked the trooper behind the wheel to
rush him to a concert stage for a show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just confused,'' said Parmley.
</P>
<P>
   As the festival matured Saturday into the outsized music event
promoters had promised, a few Woodstock eccentricities also
emerged. Namely, trash and nudity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been naked all morning,'' shrugged Mark Puma, 28, of
Brockport, N.Y., after watching one of a series of nude female
beauty contests, held on the top of a trailer. ``It's cool.''
Friday night, as the British rock band Bush played on Woodstock's
east stage, nude men were engaged in a mountain-bike race around a
cordoned dirt track.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, the ground-level view of the concert, the 30-year
anniversary of the 1969 original in Bethel, N.Y., was a rather
filthy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all the pizza boxes,'' said Marie Costello, 48, after
snapping a photo of two friends standing amid an ever-deepening sea
of the boxes, pizza slices, flattened french fries, melon rinds,
corn cobs, soda bottles, paper cups and discarded clothing. ``It's
getting thicker and thicker. You have to watch where you step.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woodstock e-mail tent, usually the site of long lines of
young Internet enthusiasts, closed for several hours Saturday to
allow frantic staffers to see some of the music being played. But
fans, seeking money to buy more of what even the concession clerks
say is overpriced food and water, are enduring long lines to access
Fleet Bank's cash machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone through $150 on drinks and food already,'' said
Puma, as he lay spread-eagled with two friends on a patch of
stomped-down grass. ``And I haven't had a beer yet. It's too hot to
drink.''

YANKS BEAT INDIANS, 21-1  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There will be a Yankees staff meeting in late
September to prepare for the American League playoffs, with Manager
Joe Torre and others circled around a table. General Manager Brian
Cashman will be there, as well as the principal owner, George
Steinbrenner, and in that meeting they will remember what Hideki
Irabu did Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They will discuss the Yankees' pitching rotation for the
playoffs, and somebody will recall how on a miserably hot day in
July, Irabu dominated the Cleveland Indians. Remember how he threw
strikes, someone might say. Remember how he confidently he pitched,
throwing his curveball and his fastball for strikes and prompting
the Indians to chase his split-fingered fastball out of the strike
zone, while his teammates feasted on Cleveland's meaty pitching in
a 21-1 wipeout at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis had five hits, matching his career high; Jorge
Posada established a career high with four hits, and nine other
Yankees had at least one hit, among the team's 21. The Yankees
scored 14 runs over the middle three innings, beginning their
onslaught against the veteran left-hander Mark Langston.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians had been forced to go deep into their bullpen in
Friday night's 10-inning loss to the Yankees, and as Cleveland was
pounded Saturday, Manager Mike Hargrove turned to Tom Candiotti for
relief _ less than 24 hours after the knuckleballer started
Friday's game. The Yankees will try to complete a sweep of the
series against their A.L. rival Sunday afternoon, when Roger
Clemens (9-4) faces Cleveland's Bartolo Colon (9-3).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 59-37, the best record in the major leagues, six
and a half games ahead of Toronto in the East Division before the
completion of the Blue Jays' game Saturday night, and the Yankees
probably will not play many more meaningful regular-season games.
Sure, Toronto will play in New York soon and the remaining games
with Boston will contain the usual intensity. But the Yankees are
destined for the playoffs, and the primary focus over the last two
months of the regular season will be preparing for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If David Cone, Roger Clemens and Orlando Hernandez are healthy,
they will be part of the pitching rotation, especially if the
Yankees play Texas in the first round and have the home-field
advantage, a strong possibility; the Rangers are loaded with
right-handed hitters. Unless Andy Pettitte is traded before
Saturday's deadline, the decision facing Torre, the pitching coach
Mel Stottlemyre and the rest of the Yankees' staff will be whether
to employ Irabu or Pettitte as the No. 4 starter in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Irabu faded badly in the last three and a half months
of the season and spent the entire post-season tucked away in a
corner of the bullpen, waiting for a disaster that never occurred;
Irabu would have pitched only if a starter either was injured or
knocked out in the first couple of innings.
</P>
<P>
   But Irabu is making a strong bid for a more integral role this
season. His record since May 25 is 6-0, and he has done well in
games against good teams, games that are important to the Yankees.
He beat the Blue Jays on May 30, allowed two runs in seven innings
against the Rangers on June 14 and earlier this month fought and
scrapped in a tough game against the Mets in the third game of a
series in Shea Stadium and prevented the Yankees from getting
swept.
</P>
<P>
   His outing against the Indians Saturday, however, was among his
best against a contender, and he was throwing well even before the
Yankees turned this game into a laugher with seven runs in the
fifth inning and six more in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu began throwing his curveball at the beginning of last year
almost as a novelty, something to show off every so often, like
gaudy dice hanging off the rear-view mirror of a sports car. But
Irabu's seemingly inert curveball _ it ambles along at 63-67 miles
an hour _ has become a significant part of what propels him.
</P>
<P>
   Hitters rarely swing at it, and he has become adept at throwing
it for strikes; for Irabu, it's like getting two free numbers in
the batter versus pitcher lottery. Irabu fired a first-pitch strike
to 10 consecutive hitters in one stretch, and in the first five
innings he reached a two-ball, no-strike count only twice. Irabu
allowed seven hits, one walk and a run in seven innings. In his
last 10 outings, he has allowed more than three runs only once,
with an earned run average of 3.05.
</P>
<P>
   He was in complete command, no doubt aided by the late-afternoon
shadows that stretched across home plate and then the pitcher's
mound, obscuring the hitters' vision in a game that began at 4:35
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But dimmed sight lines hardly bothered the Yankees, who scored
four runs against Langston in the first inning, with Davis dumping
a two-run single off the glove of a diving Kenny Lofton. The
Yankees added a run in the fourth before their offensive dam broke
on the Indians in the fifth. The rally began with Davis smacking a
double off Langston and continued until 12 Yankees had batted, with
seven runs scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius led off the sixth with a home run, and Davis
capped the explosion with a three-run home run, off Candiotti. The
Yankees led, 18-0, and they wouldn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis singled home a run in the seventh, Ricky Ledee added
a two-run single, giving them a 20-run lead.

GALAXY'S MATHIS RETURNS TO STARTING ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- This has been a humbling season for the Galaxy's
utility striker and playmaker, Clint Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes his return to a starting role against Kansas City this
afternoon at the Rose Bowl is because he earned it -- not because
Cobi Jones and Robin Fraser are with the U.S. National Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not always the best thing to say `you're starting just
because Cobi's gone or this and that,''' said Mathis. ``I've been
working hard and this is a big opportunity for me to get in and
show myself and the rest of the league that maybe I can start and
become an impact player.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering his second MLS season, Mathis' confidence was soaring
at the beginning of the season. The 22-year-old had spent time with
the U.S. National team and when the Galaxy carelessly sold
midfielder Martin Machon to Santos of the Mexican first division at
the end of last season -- Mathis figured to be the natural
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed when Mathis, a rookie-of-the-year candidate in
1998, struggled with fellow playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos, mostly
because Cienfuegos arrived to the team late after a contract
dispute with Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted new coach Sigi Schmid to move Mathis to the
front-line, replacing Welton as the Galaxy's scoring problems
became a headache.
</P>
<P>
   As Schmid settled, he acquired foreign midfielders Roy Myers and
Simon Elliott. The new duo made an immediate impact, leaving Mathis
paired up front with Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But when when Mexican striker Carlos Hermosillo arrived June 12,
there was no place for Mathis to go. He returned to the place he
began as a rookie -- on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes coming off the bench when you're at this level,''
said Mathis. ``I tried to look at it in a positive way. Everyone
likes to play the whole game but you have to look at reality
sometimes. We're a team, not just 11 players. That means your bench
has to do its job when they're called upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's all I've been doing. I've been fortunate to put
some goals away when they've called on me. I figure if I keep
working and scoring it only makes the coaches decision tougher to
keep you off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis has shown his potential of late.
</P>
<P>
   In the Galaxy's last match against New England, Mathis returned
as a midfielder starter (replacing Elliott, injury) and scored his
team-leading sixth goal in a 5-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   And in a U.S. Cup game earlier this week, Mathis -- a striker
while Jones is with the U.S. National team -- scored twice in a 3-2
victory over the San Diego Flash.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's responded in such a professional way,'' said assistant
coach Ralph Perez. ``Clint has been asked to play a variety of
roles for us this season and that's not always fair. When you're
versatile it hurts you a little bit because then you're put into a
lot of positions where you can't hone in on any particular
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's done a wonderful job coming off the bench for us.
He's been the big spark we've needed at times. I know it's tough
going for playing to not playing, but it isn't because he hasn't
done his job. We just felt it was a good role for him and this team
at this particular time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he's starting or coming off the bench, Schmid couldn't
be happier with Mathis' work rate and willingness to move around.
Schmid also says Mathis is more of a complete player than he was a
few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing a much better job using his turn of speed,'' said
Schmid. ``He's also a very explosive player with a good first step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clint's on his way. He's dynamic and willing to take risks in
the final third (of the field) and his running off the ball is
better than it was. He also has a willingness to go at people
quickly and as a result he's scoring goals.''
</P>
<P>
   With Western Conference leaders Colorado and Chicago to follow
the Kansas City game this week, Mathis realizes he's needed more
than ever, especially with Jones and Fraser not around.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a lot of depth, one player isn't going to make a
difference,'' said Mathis. ``But if I can go out and score some
goals then good things will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things I've learned. If you don't go out
there and work hard to get it done, there is always someone coming
off the bench who can do it for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an opportunity this week to help my team win. That's
the only thing I'm thinking about. All the other (personal) stuff
happens happens when your team wins games.''

   GALAXY UPDATE: Los Angeles has won five of its last six,
including a 5-2 victory over New England before the All-Star break.
They are starting to show signs of the team that scored 85 goals in
32 games last season, but remain in fourth place in the Western
Conference standings behind Colorado (12-4, 32 points), Chicago
(10-7, 28 points) and Dallas (10-9, 28 points) as the second half
of the season begins this afternoon. Defender Robin Fraser and
striker Cobi Jones are both with the U.S. National team in Mexico.
They will also miss crucial road games against Colorado and Chicago
later this week. And with defender Paul Caligiuri questionable with
a strained left groin, Clint Mathis, Ezra Hendrickson and Daniel
Hernandez will likely get starting nods. All three were starters at
the beginning of the season before losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   WIZARDS UPDATE: Kansas City started the second half of the
season with a 4-3 victory over Tampa Bay, Thursday. They started to
show signs of life by winning three of four games earlier in the
season, but dropped their last two games prior to the All-Star
break, including a 5-0 drubbing to Dallas. Kansas City has
traditionally fared better in the second half of the season (19-17)
and they have beaten the Galaxy once this year.

FOR A TIME, THEY WERE VAPOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Atwood was in a 25-foot sailboat called Vapor with his
partner, Bill Boyd, for 18 days out in the middle of the Pacific
Ocean, battling the elements and enduring the fates like a
modern-day Sir Francis Drake.
</P>
<P>
   He admits there was a cloying monotony to the 2,225 mile
Transpacific Yacht Race adventure he recently completed from Pt.
Fermin in San Pedro to Diamond Head near Honolulu sleep three
hours, steer three hours day after rainy day surrounded by nothing
more illuminating than ocean water.
</P>
<P>
   ``You become like a robot out there after a while,'' says
Atwood, a 1973 Millikan High graduate and 43-year-old younger
brother of two-time Olympic swimmer Susie Atwood. ``You know
eventually you'll reach your destination. You know eventually it'll
all come to an end. But the sheer boredom of it all can become a
struggle. You just have to keep reminding yourself to enjoy the
moments because those moments will become great memories one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood relates there was an interesting, if not slightly
troubling group of whales Atwood estimates there were at least 40
who shadowed the boat for a couple of hours one afternoon and even
blew foul-smelling water from their snouts on him and Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the huge hump back whales, and we kept a wary eye on
them,'' says Atwood. ``I don't know what we could have done had
they decided to become aggressive. The only weapon we had on board
was a flare gun. Still, it was bad enough they sprayed us with
water. There was a terrible odor, and it was the worst shower I've
ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   But what made the trip so unique for Atwood and Boyd and gained
them widespread media attention was a broken rudder that
dramatically impeded the progress of the Vapor and a malfunctioning
radio that prevented the two men from having daily communications
with race officials.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for 15 harrowing days harrowing, that is, for their
families Atwood and Boyd lost contact with civilization.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew their whereabouts, but Scott Atwood insisted the
mood on the Vapor never reached a panic state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never once feared for our lives,'' he says. ``We were
always in control of the situation, despite the broken rudder. It
broke after we got out about 1,000 miles, but we tried to go with
it as long as we could. We wrapped a bunch of lines around the
rudder like a tourniquet, and kept it together for about 500 more
miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we finally had to go to the backup rudder, which is not
built as strongly as the primary one. It's much like one of those
small spare tires they use on cars. I believe we were in first
place in our class when the rudder first broke, but after that we
couldn't go much faster than five or six knots a hour. I think we
went around 90 miles a day instead of the 170 we would have had the
rudder not broken. We were reduced to going to a crawl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vapor, the smallest sailboat in the history of the Transpac
race that began in 1906, finally reached its destination on July 17
at 6 p.m after departing on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good to hit land,'' admits Atwood. ``I love sailing.
It's my great passion in life. But this trip was a little
frustrating. Scary? Never. Oh, we touched the mast out there a few
times during the rain storms and we were besieged with them for the
final 1,000 miles but it never got dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Atwood has been a boating enthusiast as long as he can
remember one of his uncles, Al Frost, introduced him to the pastime
when he was a kid and he was a member of the crew on the winning
sailboat in the Transpac two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go from being first in the big boat class to last in the
small boat class in two years,'' says Atwood, son of Wright and
Marian Atwood of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Why did he choose to go in something only slightly larger than a
dinghy?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the challenge of it all,'' he says. ``I already knew
how it felt to win in a big boat. I wanted to see if I could do it
in a small one.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood's gallantly supportive wife, Kathie, presented him with a
book to read on the journey by Dr. Laura Schlessinger called ``Ten
Things Men Do To Mess Up Their Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she just was trying to tell me something,'' laughs
Atwood, who was both a water polo and swimming star at Millikan.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood got rid of his foreign car repair business, Los Alamitos
Motors, in January to concentrate on his sailing interests and also
to obtain his teaching degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get into teaching so I can have the summers off for
my boating,'' he says. ``Right now I'm looking for a job.
</P>
<P>
   The father of three children, Christopher, 11, Sean, 6 and
Kimberley, 2, Atwood and his family reside in Huntington Beach.
</P>
<P>
   For those who find it difficult to lose weight, Scott Atwood
recommends an 18-day odyssey at sea eating only one meal a day, as
he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a small gas-powered stove on board, and we ate a lot
pre-prepared dinners,'' he says. ``I figure I lost 10 to 15 pounds.
We also went through a case of Gatorade, a case of soft drinks and
11 of the 14 two and a half gallon Arrowhead water containers we
had on board. We also had a bottle of rum and bottle of wine, but
never touched either.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Atwood plans to participate in the Transpac again, but not
in a boat he could fit into his dining room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather go with a full crew if for no other reason I'd like
more people to talk to,'' says Atwood. ``After 18 days in such a
confined area, Bill and I didn't have much to talk about after a
while. It can get a little lonely out there, but it was an
experience I wouldn't trade for anything ... ''

PUNTER CHASES HIS DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The painter climbed the ladder and began to work.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Thursday and he had a lot of catching up to do. It is
no easy task supporting a wife and small child.
</P>
<P>
   He slapped some paint on the roller and applied it carefully to
the blank wall in front of him. His mind began to drift.
</P>
<P>
   Just three days earlier, the painter had a different job. He was
the starting punter for the San Francisco 49ers. Years of kicking
around on the fringes of the National Football League had seemingly
paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The painter's dream had finally come true. Then came the phone
call. ESPN was reporting that the 49ers had decided to cut their
punter after just the second game of the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing will stop punter Eddie Howard, 26, a 1991 graduate of
Covina, from pursuing his dream. Nothing. Even if it means he has
to paint houses between kicking jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always told myself I want to be able to look in the mirror
and say, `I gave it all I had,' '' Howard said. ``I don't want to
look back and think, `If only I would have done this or that.' As
long as I continue to try, I won't have to say `if.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Howard has been working out with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this
year and has been asked to attend their training camp, which begins
Aug. 1. After years of preparation, Howard -- by all accounts --
finally has a shot at achieving his goal.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more proud than Howard's wife, Monique, who is
pregnant with their second child and living with her parents in
Arcadia. She understands her husband's dream, even as their lives
become more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line boils down to, I will never be the one to
squash it as long as it's realistic,'' Monique Howard said. ``He
genuinely has a better chance every year. So who am I to say,`It's
time to stop?' It's getting harder, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anyone, Monique, a second-grade teacher at Workman
Elementary in Covina, knows that when the 49ers cut Eddie it wasn't
the first indignity he had suffered in pursuit of his dream.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation in 1995 from the University of Idaho, Howard
was signed and cut by the Green Bay Packers. He was cut by the
Detroit Lions after minicamp in 1996; cut in the preseason by the
Chicago Bears in 1997; and cut on the final day of training camp in
1998 by the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   That was almost the roller coaster's last stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flying home debating what I was going to do,'' Howard
recalled. ``I thought, `I got to get back to work -- put food on
the table. I wasn't too sure what was going to happen. It's tough
when you get released.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he got off the plane, Monique had some news.
</P>
<P>
   ```You are trying out for San Francisco,' she told me,'' Howard
said. ``It was a crazy, crazy experience. Here you prepare yourself
for the worst. Your emotions are up and down. You get released and
you are not in the best of moods. Then I'm trying out with San
Francisco, the 49ers, a team I had looked up to all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he made the team, Eddie was signed to a contract for
$10,000 a week. He called Monique and told her to quit her job. On
the Wednesday before the opening game of the season, Howard
attended his first practice. It was brutal. Howard felt powerless
and alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough,'' he recalled. ``I'm getting yelled at, it's
windy and I don't know anybody other then the guys I'd seen on
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came Sunday. In front of a national television audience and
a sellout crowd of partisan 49er fans at 3Com Park, Howard shanked
a punt.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I remember is walking off the field and I'm getting
booed,'' he said. ``The next day I was reading in the newspaper,
`If Howard doesn't have a good game, this could be it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Game two was a Monday nighter against the Redskins. Howard
turned in a so-so performance. After the game he remembers hearing
San Francisco head coach Steve Mariucci tell someone, ``We're going
to have patience (with Howard).''
</P>
<P>
   After a long flight home, Howard was planning on a day off and
an opportunity to redeem himself in the third week of the season.
It never came.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a message form Monique that said, `I think they
released you,''' Howard recalled. ``That's the whole thing. There
was no humanity factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard's family learned his fate from an early morning report on
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like that,'' he said. ``Two days later I'm in
Orange Country on the job and with every step up that ladder I was
thinking I could be playing somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Although frustrated, Howard continued to paint. Every afternoon
he put down the brushes and rollers, took off the coveralls, and
picked up his football to go practice punting at Arcadia High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you have to do,'' he said. ``I know I can play.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The call from Tampa Bay came during Easter week. Howard was on a
flight for Tampa right after Easter dinner, Monique recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time a family occasion clashed with Eddie's
football career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year he wasn't here and I had my daughter,'' Monique
said. ``He was on a cell phone listening in when I was giving
birth. We got married July 5, 1997, then he left a week later for
camp in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just understood that every year he's going to camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are settling down though. Although the Bucaneers are
paying Howard only $280 a week, he plans to fly home from Tampa to
attend the birth of the couple's second child, due any day now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to miss the birth of their child,'' he said. ``I
don't want to ever feel like I put football in front of family or
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   And if all goes according to plan, Eddie may survive the
preseason to find a spot on the Buccaneers' roster, according to
Joel Buschbaum, an expert on player development for the magazine
``Pro Football Weekly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a decent college punter and he's got an outside shot
with Tampa Bay because they don't have a punter right now,''
Buschbaum said. ``He's going to have to do better than he did last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard thinks 1999 might be his year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to sign unless I had a serious shot,'' he said.
``I'd like to make Tampa Bay home and get a chance to play against
all the other teams that didn't give me a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Howard is not a sure thing. And if Tampa Bay gives him the
brush-off, the punter will trade in his NFL uniform for coveralls
and become the painter once again.

PROSECUTORS REACH ACROSS INTERNATIONAL BOUNDRIES TO HAUL IN
DEADBEAT DADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CHARLES, Mo. _ David Goldberg, a St. Charles chiropractor,
avoided paying $74,000 in child support by living in Israel for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg returned to the United States this month, but not
because of detectives or diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the photocopied papers on Benicia Baker-Livorsi's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Baker-Livorsi, an assistant prosecutor in St. Charles County.
knew she had her man when she came across a 1963 treaty requiring
Israel to return parents accused of putting their children's
welfare at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that treaty, authorities say, Goldberg almost became
the first American extradited for allegedly not paying child
support. Instead, he voluntarily returned July 13.
</P>
<P>
   More and more the enforcement of child support is moving
overseas as immigration and international commerce increase. That
means prosecutors are sifting through arcane treaties and pacts to
enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cases are finally getting the attention they deserve,''
Baker-Livorsi said. ``A child's suffering knows no international
borders.''
</P>
<P>
   In Goldberg's case, prosecutors did not have to rely on
international pacts, because he turned himself in. Now he faces 11
felony counts of failure to pay child support. A preliminary
hearing is Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's case earned him notoriety in St. Louis. Photos of him
exiting a plane, in handcuffs, were displayed prominently in the
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Melissia Goldberg, Goldberg's fifth wife, has
evoked sympathy for her story. She said she lost the family's
five-bedroom home and was forced to move to a campground. She sold
jewelry and other assets to provide food. Residents have responded
by donating thousands of dollars and an offer for lodging.
</P>
<P>
   David Goldberg's attorney, Art Margulis, acknowledged that
Goldberg owed money to his fourth wife. Goldberg returned to St.
Louis to straighten out the situation, Margulis said.
</P>
<P>
   Margulis called Melissia Goldberg's claims a sham. He said
Goldberg provided her with several $1,000 payments and assets to
sell. Margulis contends Melissia Goldberg misspent the money.
</P>
<P>
   Margulis also complained that David Goldberg faced a $310,000
bond _ payable only in cash. Margulis said the children would be
better- served if Goldberg would be released so he could earn a
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can resolve this,'' Margulis said. ``But the
prosecutor seems bent on jail time as part of any solution. If
that's their attitude, we would have a real problem in settling
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, however, argue that Goldberg is a risk to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The case already has altered Goldberg's once-tranquil life.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, 41, had chiropractor offices in Kansas City and St.
Charles, about 20 miles northwest of St. Louis. He and Melissia
adopted five children from Latin America. But he owed child support
to Lisa Burns, his fourth wife.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow _ Margulis has no explanation _ Goldberg fell behind on
the payments. Melissia Goldberg said her husband told her last
October: ``I'm in trouble. We need to leave right away.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't want to go to Israel, so he left without her.
</P>
<P>
   At that point Melissia Goldberg didn't know where to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a state of shock,'' she said. ``But I got my
self-worth back and took over trying to look out for my children.
No matter what, we were going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg was charged by St. Charles County prosecutors with not
paying $74,000 to Burns and an unspecified amount to Melissia
Goldberg. He remains jailed and declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Melissia Goldberg has filed for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to tracking down Goldberg, Baker-Livorsi and her
staff sought help from the Department of Justice and state
authorities. They looked for legal and diplomatic alternatives and
found the 1963 treaty. Prosecutors said they had attempted in the
past to make overseas contact with parents in arrears on child
support, but they knew of no other extradition attempts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges in international child-support cases is
that global laws are a patchwork. Even then, each country will
enforce existing agreements with different levels of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You run into so many roadblocks,'' said Anna Giorgio of
Pittsburgh, who said her husband moved to Europe and was not paying
child support. ``You don't even know where to start. You really
feel helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents turn to private collectors, who boast that they can
track down deadbeats all over the world. Prosecutors warn, however,
that those collectors have no legal authority and can charge hefty
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the deadbeat parents are found, spouses and lawyers
face other hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie White, senior collections officer in the district
attorney's office in Contra Costa County, Calif., recalls her
pursuit of a parent to Germany. Correspondence with German
authorities had to be translated and phone calls exchanged at odd
hours because of the time difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough trouble tracking down all our parents in our
own country. Now take that times a hundred when you're talking
about a foreign country,'' said White, co-author of (begin
ital.)The Child Support Survival Guide(end ital.).
</P>
<P>
   Individual U.S. states also can sign agreements with other
countries, but Missouri has no such agreements, Baker-Livorsi said.
She hopes Missouri lawmakers will move more aggressively to work
with other nations.
</P>
<P>
   California maintains agreements with almost 20 nations _ from
Bermuda to the Czech Republic. Not all countries want to cooperate,
however. White said Mexico did not sign an agreement until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal authorities also can take such actions as
revoking business licenses, suspending passports and garnisheeing
wages, if the parent works overseas for an American firm.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Melissia Goldberg's attorneys said they would be
satisfied to reach a settlement with Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   The children, whose financial care prompted the case, are
holding up well, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, Melissia Goldberg plans to move into a
home and continue her studies for a bachelor's degree in
communications.
</P>
<P>
   She said the pursuit of her husband across the globe was worth
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want justice to be served,'' she said. ``I want him to
take responsibility for these children. We're willing to do
whatever it takes to have him own up to what he needs to do.''

REFORM PARTY CONVENTIONEERS CONSIDER FUTURE WITHOUT PEROT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Updates with Perot comments)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. - With disarray in their ranks, leaders of the
Reform Party Saturday struggled at their annual convention to
restore power and relevance to their maverick movement, as they
pondered a possible future without H. Ross Perot at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiercest challenge yet to Perot's leadership, the party's
new star, Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, called before the
convention for the Texas billionaire to relinquish his grip on the
organization and renounce a possible bid for the presidency in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's forces then pushed on the first two days of the
three-day conclave for a rules change that would loosen Perot's
lock on the party apparatus. And Ventura campaigned for a new party
chairman who wants Perot to step aside for the movement's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, in his first public comments on the showdown, gave no
clear indication in a speech Saturday night to nearly 350 delegates
about whether he intends to make a third run for the White House.
The Texas billionaire said: ``As long as I am helpful to the
organization I'm certainly happy to help and participate in any
constructive way.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot made no direct reference to Ventura, the former
professional wrestler who shocked the political establishment last
year by seizing the Minnesota governorship and becoming the only
party member to have won a significant elected office.
</P>
<P>
   But Perot was clearly rankled by the controversy swirling around
the party he founded. ``The last thing I want is all of these
things I see in the paper day in and day out about catfights that
have nothing to do with fact but make great fiction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just remember,'' he exhorted the crowd, ``united teams win and
divided teams lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot's top adviser, Russell J. Verney, said earlier Perot is
ready to step aside if the delegates so desire. Verney himself is
giving up his post after running the party for Perot since he
founded it in 1995. ``I think they are at the point where they are
ready to blossom,'' Verney said of a new wave of Reform Party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, who has pumped $72 million of his fortune into the
third-party movement, stunned both major parties by winning nearly
20 percent of the presidential vote in 1992. But he garnered only
8.5 percent in a dismal outing in 1996, and many of his longtime
supporters believe his time has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe him an enormous debt for getting us this far,'' said
Jack Gargan, Ventura's choice to replace Verney as national
chairman in Sunday's election. ``Now it's time for him to turn the
party over to us, to let the birdie out of the nest and watch us
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   The push for Perot to step aside came amid a virtual
free-for-all in the early race for the party's presidential
nomination _ and the $12.6 million in federal matching funds that
accompanies the prize.
</P>
<P>
   With the two major parties watching warily, fearful that a
Reform candidate could sway the outcome of next year's presidential
race, there were booths, buttons, billboards, bumper stickers and
bands of delegates promoting nearly every conceivable nominee in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ventura refused to reschedule his weekend
activities and attend the convention after his flight from
Minnesota to Detroit for the opening session on Friday was canceled
due to thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ventura spoke to the delegates that night by speaker
phone. He praised Perot's contributions to the movement, insisted
he has no designs on the presidency in 2000, and gave a final boost
to Gargan's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the battle between Gargan and candidates loyal to
Perot grew increasingly nasty, as both sides accused each other of
jeopardizing the party's future for their short-term political
expedience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is not always pretty and this is one of those times
when it isn't,'' said Patricia Benjamin, Gargan's leading opponent,
who is seen as a Perot ally. ``Everybody is going in a different
direction. But hopefully we'll all end up in the same place at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the acrimony, many delegates said they feared the party
could be dangerously riven if the skirmish is not resolved before
the convention ends Sunday. ``This is a critical time for us,''
said Donna Donovan of Glastonbury, Conn. ``We absolutely have to
look like we have our act together when we come out of this
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's Massachusetts chairman, Andy Lizotte of
Milford, said he wished ``everybody would take a step back'' from
the ``grudge match'' for the good of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Lizotte said party members ``are realistic enough to see the
numbers and recognize that Ross Perot would have a very difficult
time winning'' in 2000.

SAMPRAS STILL SIMPLY THE BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you never saw a George Mikan hook shot or a Don
Budge backhand, if you missed Sandy Koufax's fastball and Roman
Gabriel's bombs, you had best not pass on the chance to study Pete
Sampras this week at the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA's Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is a local treasure on loan to the world, as much a sign
of the progression of tennis as the La Brea Tar Pits are of
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   His tennis talent, dug up from concrete courts in Torrance some
21 years ago, has been polished to an incandescent sheen. Sampras'
brilliance is the benchmark upon which future generations of tennis
stars will be compared.
</P>
<P>
   He is, quite simply, the best.
</P>
<P>
   We say this even though Roland Garros is one opponent Sampras
has yet to conquer. We know full well how Bill Tilden helped put
the roaring into the Twenties with his temperamental genius and
Davis Cup dramatics. We haven't forgotten Budge's Grand Slam in
1938 or Rod Laver's two Grand Slams, in 1962 and 1969.
</P>
<P>
   We're quite cognizant Sampras isn't bringing a global No. 1
ranking into his backyard tournament, his first competition since
capturing his 12th Grand Slam title at Wimbledon earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   That Sampras is ranked No. 3 reflects not on his game but the
lameness of the soon-to-be-shucked ratings system. (Sampras himself
took a shot at the status quo in a recent conference call with
reporters, quoting a friend who quipped, ``You could be dead and be
ranked No. 1.'')
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Sampras could be the second coming of Tilden.
His game is that complete. Because the Nineties have been replete
with challengers to Sampras' throne, he deserves history's nod.
</P>
<P>
   From Andre to Yevgeny, ``there's 60 players, maybe even more
than that, who are capable of winning'' a Grand Slam. So said
Laver, whose road to Grand Slam glory every year tended to have the
same speed bumps. Their names: Roy Emerson, Ken Rosewall and Tony
Roche.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' defeat of Andre Agassi at Wimbledon moved him into a
tie with Emerson for the all-time lead in Grand Slam titles, one
ahead of Laver.
</P>
<P>
   When Laver was going for his second Grand Slam, in 1969, he got
so nervous he chewed his fingernails until they bled. Last year
Sampras, in an effort to retain his No. 1 ranking for a record
sixth consecutive year, entered seven of the final eight
tournaments and saw his hair fall out from the stress.
</P>
<P>
   He retained his top ranking and felt more relief than joy. That
told him something. If he has to go to such lengths to extend his
top ranking one more year, there likely will be a new No. 1 to
shoot for in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how much I enjoyed getting it,'' Sampras said.
``People ask me if it was worth it and I say `kind of.' When it was
over I was as drained as I've ever been, physically and mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, the pressures were decidedly different. A
player in Laver's day had to be among the best in the world to make
a comfortable living. If he didn't win, his mortgage might not get
paid.
</P>
<P>
   A player today can live like a prince without making much of a
run at No. 1. Lacking any financial incentives to plant their flag
on the summit, some players seem more inclined to linger at the
ledge just below the peak where it's easier to breathe and
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   They're the ones you hear grousing when the rankings computer
spits them out at the top. They're the ones who tank matches and
horde appearance fees and make you appreciate Sampras all the more.
He set out to be No. 1 at the age of 7 and, once there, has never
wavered in his desire or diligence.
</P>
<P>
   There are certain people, Sampras conceded, who need to be the
best to feel good about themselves. He mentioned Ivan Lendl and
Jimmy Connors and then he dropped his guard for just a second,
perhaps just to see if we were paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras couldn't have bared more of himself if he had dropped
his drawers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might also fall into that category,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So it turns out winning is a drug for Sampras, his own personal
Prozac. Goodness knows we've heard of athletes with far worse
addictions.
</P>
<P>
   It's fitting that Sampras' return to the L.A. Tennis Center
after a few years' absence coincides with the tournament's lauding
of Laver, who will be honored in a ceremony on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster, Sampras watched 16-millimeter films of Laver's
matches as raptly as today's kids do ``The Lion King.'' From his
serve-and-volley game to his shy demeanor to his French Open
failures (Laver had a 6-5 record at Roland Garros before his
breakthrough victory in 1962), Sampras' resemblance to Laver is
uncanny.
</P>
<P>
   They are as alike as a lanky, tanned, dark-haired bachelor and a
compact, fair-skinned, red-headed husband and father of two could
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked him what charisma was, he'd think you were
referring to the Romanian junior champion,'' a writer once whined
of Laver.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is painted in the same drab tones today by people who
cannot be dazzled by simple elegance. Too often what the eye is
drawn to are the accessories _ the tattoos, the temper tantrums and
titillating private lives turned inside-out for the sake of the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   A silken one-handed backhand and 125-mph serves? They don't
impress some people much.
</P>
<P>
   If Sampras were a plumber fixing a broken pipe or an accountant
preparing a tax return, his ethereal efficiency and good manners
would be endearing. Of course, game, set and match points are never
to be confused with rupture points or decimal points.
</P>
<P>
   We like our sports figures to be compelling and not just
competent. And if that means setting an example of boorishness or
brutishness for our children, well, then, we'll just tell the kids
to do as we say and not as their idols do.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is different. He'd be worth impersonating if he weren't
so inimitable. &QL;

BEHIND THE SCENES, SUTTON MAKES A DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Don Sutton knows something about big moments.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched in four World Series and won 324 games. His career
was just beginning when Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale were winding
down with the Dodgers. By the time he was through, Sutton was
headed to the Hall of Fame, where he was inducted one year ago
today.
</P>
<P>
   The focus now has shifted to two of Sutton's other former
teammates, Nolan Ryan and Robin Yount, who along with George Brett
and Orlando Cepeda are going into Cooperstown today.
</P>
<P>
   After 24 big-league seasons, Sutton has a lot of former
teammates. But Ryan and Yount were special; Ryan for the sheer
electricity his fastball brought to every game, Yount for the
competitive spirit that made winners of the Milwaukee Brewers even
if they only appeared in one World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's favorite moment during his short time with the Brewers
came on the final day of the 1982 season. He was pitching against
Baltimore's Jim Palmer, another Hall of Famer, and trying to hold
off the Orioles' late-season charge for just one more day.
</P>
<P>
   But what he remembers best was the pregame clubhouse. The
Brewers had nearly been caught by the Orioles and had every reason
to panic. But when Sutton walked in he remembers nothing but calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most relaxed clubhouse for a big game I had ever
been in,'' Sutton said. ``Robin made it that way. That was his
season and this was his moment. No shouting, no yelling. You just
knew we were going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   When Yount hit two homers off Palmer in that game, the Brewers
had their title. They came back from a 0-2 deficit to beat the
Angels in the league championship series but lost in seven games to
St. Louis in the World Series. Yount was chosen American League
MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an honor to be a part of something that great,'' said
Sutton, who came over from Ryan's Houston Astros as a late-season
addition. ``And an honor to play with Robin Yount.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton is now a candid and respected broadcaster for the Atlanta
Braves, but he has always made a point of remaining distant from
the lives of modern players. There was no shagging flies before
games, no batting-practice sessions just to see if he could still
bring it.
</P>
<P>
   But quietly, Sutton has been offering advice to any pitcher who
approaches him and there are about a half-dozen Braves who have
sought his counsel. He has a particular interest in All-Star
right-hander Kevin Millwood, whom he compares to Drysdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his makeup, his personality,'' Sutton said. ``He wants
to be good and he wants to be good because it's the right thing to
do, not because he wants to be well-known for doing it. His
personality is almost identical to Don Drysdale. He plays a lot
older than his birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   After Millwood got off to a poor start this season, Sutton dug
through some old files to show the young right-hander pictures of
Drysdale to illustrate a flaw in his delivery. It's no coincidence
Millwood has won 10 of his last 12 decisions since that talk.
</P>
<P>
   Then two-time Cy Young award-winner Tom Glavine pulled Sutton
aside following a disastrous performance against the Brewers on May
24 that left him with a 3-5 record and a 5.54 ERA. His question:
``Is this the point in my career when I should begin pitching
differently?''

   ``I talked to him for reassurance more than anything else,''
Glavine said. ``I had my own thoughts on it and he pretty much
echoed what I felt and that was, no, I didn't have to start doing
things differently. There's a guy who's won an awful lot of
ballgames; who better to ask about changing your philosophy than a
guy who's been through the wars?''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton has worked quietly behind the scenes to ensure he doesn't
interfere with pitching coach Leo Mazzone. So far the ``I'm here if
you need me'' approach has worked perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned from Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale and Claude
Osteen is that every one of us have something we can contribute to
someone else,'' Sutton said. ``That's the atmosphere I learned
in.'' &QL;

SPARKS WIN IN OT
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Lisa Leslie scored nine of her 22 points in
overtime as the Sparks won their third consecutive game while
handing the aggressive New York Liberty its second loss in a row,
75-72, in front of 6,896 at the Forum Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Sparks' first win in nine games in front of a
national television audience, but it took some last-minute heroics
to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   They rallied from a 16-point deficit in the first half, and then
in the last minute of regulation Sparks guard Gordana Grubin
answered New York's Crystal Robinson's 3-pointer with one of her
own to tie the score, 59-59. But then Crystal responded with
another shot from beyond the arc. Then it was Mwadi Mabika's turn.
She sent the game into overtime after launching an off-center
23-foot shot from near the right baseline with 7.8 seconds
remaining in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie then went to work, scoring the first six points on two
free throws, a layup, and a 3-pointer from the top of the key.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Robinson, who was 7 of 14 from long distance for 23
points, scored a pair of free throws and a 3-pointer after Vickie
Johnson's steal to make it a five point game (74-69) with 28.2 on
the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Grubin converted two free throws, but the red hot Robinson hit
her seventh 3-pointer with 24.8 seconds to play to make it a one
possession game (75-72). DeLisha Milton missed two crucial free
throws with 23 seconds to play, but the Liberty (10-8) was unable
to execute a last shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great team effort on the defensive end and we were
able to hit some clutch shots when we needed it,'' Sparks coach
Orlando Woolridge said. ``We were very fortunate because even
though we had a lead there were a few opportunities where we didn't
make the best decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (13-6) struggled offensively behind the physical play
of New York, but matched that aggressiveness in the second half to
start with a 13-3 run that got them back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, 2-6 on the road, was at a disadvantage in the low
post after Kim Hampton fouled out with 2:36 to play in regulation.
But she couldn't have stopped Mwadi's 3-pointer anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tough because we had the game and the shot that
Mabika made at the buzzer we couldn't have defended any better,''
New York coach Richie Adubato said.
</P>
<P>
   Mabika, who had her second career double-double with 15 points
and 11 rebounds, said she was a little bit uncomfortable taking the
shot, but ``I felt like it was going in, because I was high in the
air.''

SAFECO NOT HITTERS' HAVEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ken Griffey Jr. had one home run in his first six
games at Seattle's new Safeco Field and swore he lost two more that
would have been out in the Kingdome. Alex Rodriguez hit two homers
during the same stretch. They aren't happy.
</P>
<P>
   Most Mariners players, and manager Lou Piniella, agree Safeco is
more of a pitcher's park. That might not help keep Griffey and
Rodriguez, free agents after the 2000 season, in Seattle, but no
one is happier with the place than Piniella. He has seen the team
flounder because of pitching since reaching the league championship
series in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans, the media, the players _ everyone has fallen in love
with the home run,'' Piniella said. ``This park puts a premium on
playing an all-around game, on defense and pitching and
manufacturing runs. This park will make you play better
baseball.'' &QL; 
Second-half blues
</P>
<P>
   The first-place Indians took a lot of heat for yawning their way
through a 39-38 second half last year. To prevent another letdown,
manager Mike Hargrove went to spring training with two goals _ win
100-plus games in the regular season and win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   When the Indians reported to camp, they found a T-shirt in every
locker that read ``100 plus. Go Hard or Go Home.''
</P>
<P>
   So this year they've started the second half losing six of their
first eight games. Overall, they are 4-19 when they score three or
fewer runs. Injuries to Travis Fryman and Sandy Alomar have hurt,
but complacency has done more damage. It seems as though the whole
team is hoping GM John Hart makes a Chuck Finley-like trade to
re-energize them. &QL; 
Cone's the man
</P>
<P>
   David Cone's perfect game last Sunday only strengthened the
belief in the Yankees clubhouse that he, not Roger Clemens, is the
ace of the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Cone has an ERA more than two runs lower: 2.65 to Clemens' 4.90.
With runners in scoring position, Cone is holding hitters to a .155
average. Clemens is exactly 100 points higher, .255. Overall, the
AL is batting .206 against Cone, the lowest in the league. The AL
is batting 76 points higher against Clemens, .282.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees fans are beginning to boo Clemens. If the Yankees don't
repeat as World Series champs, management might have trouble
justifying re-negotiating Clemens' contract and paying him the $15
million a year he wants. Clemens is in the third year of a
four-year, $32 million deal and has the right to demand a trade at
season's end. &QL; 
Take it easy
</P>
<P>
   Following a poor start against Florida last Sunday in which he
allowed a career-high nine runs, Boston's Pedro Martinez was bumped
from his next scheduled turn at Detroit on Friday because of
shoulder soreness.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher said he had been experiencing some discomfort in his
shoulder for roughly a month but acknowledged that he was unusually
sore following a historic performance in the July 13 All-Star Game.
Compounding Boston's rotation problems was the fact that
right-hander Mark Portugal was scratched Thursday because of back
spasms.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Sox are going with a rotation of Bret
Saberhagen, Pat Rapp and rookies Brian Rose, Jin Ho Cho and
Tomokazu Ohka. Cho's first year of pro ball was 1998; Ohka was
signed before this season. &QL; 
Pan Am grounded
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like the perfect way to help the U.S. qualify for the
2000 Olympics in Sydney _ get minor-leaguers to play in the Pan
American Games in Winnipeg, Canada. Only players who are not on
40-man, major-league rosters were eligible. Not too many of those
players get called up during the season, but this year is
different.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Nick Bierbrodt was chosen for the team before he was
recalled by Arizona. The same thing happened to Kansas City pitcher
Dan Reichert and Oakland's hard-throwing reliever, Chad Harville.
</P>
<P>
   There is the feeling Major League Baseball is wavering in its
support. The U.S. has to finish first or second in the Pan Am Games
to qualify for the Olympics. &QL;

RACE IS ON FOR GWYNN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ San Diego is moving in on San Francisco in the
West, which should take some of the pressure off Tony Gwynn's
pursuit of 3,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Most hitters believe a pennant race is an easier place to
achieve individual goals than on a dead team 35 games out. Gwynn
enters today's game needing 13 hits to reach 3,000, one more than
Tampa Bay's Wade Boggs. And don't think there isn't competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to pass him up in lifetime average (.339-.329)
after 1998, and I'm proud of that,'' Gwynn said. ``I'd like to get
to 3,000 first. It's a motivation for me. But I'm pulling for Wade
and Cal (Ripken) to make it, too. To get 3,000 hits shows
consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs, 41, batted .349 in his first full season with the Red Sox
in 1982. He then won batting titles five of the next six years. His
last title was in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, 39, has eight batting titles, including a .351 average in
his first full year of 1984. &QL; 
Show me the green
</P>
<P>
   Reds All-Star shortstop Barry Larkin, who caused quite a stir in
Cincinnati by saying he wanted to play on grass after his contract
expires after the 2000 season, now says he wants to help make it
happen at home.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin has said he would help pay the $1 million-$1.5 million it
would cost to rip up Cinergy Field's artificial turf and put in the
real stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not out of the realm of possibility,'' Larkin said.
``If it comes up in my contract negotiations, I'll consider it. I
think it's that important that we have grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds general manager Jim Bowden replied: ``We take all cash
donations.'' &QL; 
Beck's back
</P>
<P>
   Cubs reliever Rod Beck was activated Wednesday and though he
returned six weeks ahead of schedule after undergoing elbow
surgery, it probably is too late to help the team.
</P>
<P>
   Beck was reportedly clocked at 92 mph during one of two rehab
stints at Triple-A Iowa. That's more than 10 mph faster than he was
throwing in the wild-card playoff against the Giants last year.
Terry Adams has been doing a good job as the closer lately. For
now, Beck will join his replacement, Rick Aguilera, in pitching
middle relief. &QL; 
Not now
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies chose a bad time to get banged up with
division-leading Atlanta in town this weekend for a four-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star catcher Mike Lieberthal was sent back to Philadelphia
on Wednesday for an MRI on his aching right elbow. Results were
negative.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as a DH for five straight games in AL ballparks,
right fielder Bobby Abreu is out because of a sore right elbow that
forced him to miss five games in May.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rolen had to leave Wednesday night's game in the fifth
inning with a strained lower back. Rico Brogna is playing with a
broken toe on his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, pitcher Curt Schilling is bothered by biceps
tendinitis that has made it increasingly difficult to get loose. He
lasted only five innings Friday. &QL; 
Game time
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Randy Johnson starts tonight against the Dodgers'
Kevin Brown after shutting out the Mariners on Tuesday in his
return to Seattle. It was his 25th career shutout and lowered his
league-leading ERA to 2.65. He struck out 10 to increase his career
total to 2,558, passing Jerry Koosman for fifth all-time among
left-handers (18th overall).
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy gave a very Randy-esque performance,'' Seattle's Alex
Rodriguez said Tuesday. ``He really stuck it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still hard to believe the victory ended a string of four
consecutive Johnson starts where the Diamondbacks were shut out.
Johnson was the 10th pitcher since 1900 to lose four straight by
shutout.
</P>
<P>
   The worst might have been the Mets' Jim McAndrew in 1968. They
were the first four starts of his career and he had a 1.82 ERA
during that stretch. &QL;

PEROT TELLS DELEGATES HE WILL STAY ACTIVE IN REFORM PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., this replaces an earlier agency story in NYT editions)  
 (HLW)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Rejecting calls that he step aside for fresh
faces, Ross Perot vowed Saturday night to remain active in the
Reform Party that he founded, but gave no hint as to whether or not
he would seek its presidential nomination next year.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, speaking at the midpoint of the party's three-day
national convention, avoided any reference to the bitter race for
chairman of the party. The contest, to be settled on Sunday, pits
his loyalists against those of the party's biggest success story,
Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I'm helpful to the organization, I am certainly
happy to help and participate in any constructive way,'' Perot
said. ``The last thing I want is all of these things that I see in
the paper day in and day out about cat fights and this and that and
the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who addressed the 400 delegates on Friday night,
suggested that it was time for Perot to leave the party gracefully.
Ventura also personalized his endorsement of Jack Gargan, one of
the three candidates to replace the party's chairman, Russell J.
Verney, who is an aide to Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, 69, reminded delegates that ``united teams win, divided
teams lose,'' and said that the path to victory lies in doing the
right thing for their country, and for their children and
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are well organized, get in position and wait for the
opportunity,'' he said, ``those opportunities will occur across our
country and over time all of you can make a huge contribution to
the future of our nation and that is also making a contribution to
the future of the entire planet. God bless you for all of your
great work.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot seemed to be alluding to his critics' contention that the
Reform Party is a cult of personality when he said, ``You have
worked your hearts out since 1992 for one reason _ because you love
this country, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Perot's speech consisted of the populist applause lines
that helped propel his candidacies for president, in which he drew
19 percent of the vote in 1992 and 8 percent in 1996. Calling for
``the highest ethical standards'' for Congress and the White House,
he said, ``No more gifts, no more trips, no more junkets.''
</P>
<P>
   He began with an attack on unnamed special interests in
politics. ``The people who show up at the other two conventions are
saying, `Let's make a deal tonight for me,''' Perot said. Looking
straight into the cameras and praising his own delegates, he added,
``There's nothing in it for these people _ they're doing it for
their children and their grandchildren and this country. That's
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent reference to President Clinton, he said, ``We
will never have a candidate who would not be a good role model for
our children and grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot also called for four-month presidential campaigns.
``Campaigns cost too much because they last too long,'' he said.
``I wish we could just have that up on every billboard in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   A band played ``When the Saints Go Marching In,'' as he left the
stage without shaking a hand, simply calling over his shoulder,
``Keep up your good work.''

YOUNT TO GET HIS WINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Robin Yount walks to the podium this morning
in Cooperstown, he will look out at the expected record crowd and
see home.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the ``Cheeseheads'' from his adopted Milwaukee and fans
from across the country, there will be a collection of family,
friends and mentors who helped nurture Yount's memorable ride from
the San Fernando Valley to baseball's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   There will be Yount's parents Phil and Marion, who came to the
Valley in the mid-1950s with three young boys and the promise of
defense contracts and wide-open spaces. His brothers Jim and Larry,
who taught him not to waste his gift. Little League coach Clem
Cohen, who watched the magic grow on the tiny field at Victory and
Winnetka. And Jim O'Connor, the coach who watched Yount make 13
errors during his junior year at Taft High in Woodland Hills but
knew he'd never seen anyone better.
</P>
<P>
   Together they gave him wings, which scouts often said made a
Robin Yount triple the most beautiful thing to watch in baseball.
And they grounded him enough so he was able to become a starting
big-league shortstop at the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
   Yount will acknowledge them all today from that podium, when he
is inducted along with Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Orlando Cepeda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still hard to grasp that this is all happening,'' Yount
said, with a humility that helped make one of the most admired
players of his generation. ``It is difficult to think that you
belong.''
</P>
<P>
   His body of work during 20 seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers
would suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   _Yount was the third-fastest player to reach 3,000 hits,
surpassed only by Ty Cobb and Henry Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   _He was only the third player to win a Most Valuable Player
award at two positions.
</P>
<P>
   _He is the last shortstop to lead the majors in slugging
percentage (1982) and the first since Ernie Banks in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   _Yount is the second player in major-league history to record
3,000 hits, 200 home runs, 200 stolen bases and 100 triples. Willie
Mays is the other.
</P>
<P>
   _Lifetime, he batted .285 with 1,632 runs, 3,142 hits and 251
homers. When the Brewers made it to the World Series in 1982, he
batted .331 with 29 homers and 114 RBI during the regular season
and .414 during the Series.
</P>
<P>
   But if you only look at the numbers, you will miss the point.
</P>
<P>
   It was the way Yount carried the Brewers to their only World
Series appearance with a competitive fire that never flickered.
</P>
<P>
   It was the way that between 1978 and 1991 he never spent a day
on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   It was the way he fought through shoulder and leg pain late in
his career, pain that forced him to move from shortstop to center
field. Perhaps his most lasting moment is the diving catch he made
in 1987 for the final out of Juan Nieves' no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came up he was clocked at 4.1 second going to first,''
said longtime Brewers broadcaster Bob Uecker. ``Twenty years later
he was clocked at 4.2. This is a guy who just never gave up at
anything he did. All out, all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But where did it come from?
</P>
<P>
   It began in the Valley of the 1960s and early 70s, an oasis long
since paved over, where ``The Kid'' was allowed to be a kid.
</P>
<P>
   He once snuck onto the golf course at the Woodland Hills Country
Club with some buddies and wound up sinking a hole-in-one. Then he
ran off.
</P>
<P>
   He would take his vast collection of dirt bikes and motorcycles
up into the foothills in Chatsworth and ride for hours. Yount has
been out of baseball since 1994, but his passion for cars and bikes
is stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember going to Larry's games, chasing foul balls,
bringing them back and getting a free snowcone,'' Yount said. ``I
loved living in the Valley. It's entirely different now than when I
was growing up. It's grown unbelievably. I mean, I can remember
playing ball on farmland out there in Warner Center where it's now
high-rise buildings and shopping malls.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount, now 44, lives in the affluent Phoenix suburb of Paradise
Valley with his wife Michele and four teen-age children. He races
Formula 1 cars during the winter and continues to push the envelope
the way he did as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin just beat to his own drum,'' said Rick Dempsey, the
Dodgers coach, who has known Yount since childhood. ``He loved to
take chances on the baseball field and in life. He was a very free
spirit, probably the greatest free spirit I've even known.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey said there were several ingredients to Yount's success.
The first was natural athletic ability, which sometimes gets
overlooked. He once considered a professional golf career after
getting injured in a dirt-bike accident just before spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   The second was a fierce competitive nature that developed with
his older brothers and a level of concentration that seemed to
almost will him through situations on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Yount's close relationship with his brother Larry, who is six
years older and was once a pitcher in the Houston organization,
taught him many lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Larry bought Robin a batting cage for the back yard, but also
stressed that talent would only get him so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `If you want to relax and take it easy, you can do
that on your own time. But when you're out there, give it
everything you've got,''' Yount said. ``When you're young, you
don't want to listen to your brother telling you stuff like that,
but it was true.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Yount never considered himself much of a student, he
had an analytical approach to the game that came from his father,
who was an engineer at Rocketdyne.
</P>
<P>
   All that plus boundless energy gave Young an almost unfair
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't leave after a practice without hitting him another
100 ground balls,'' O'Connor said. ``We wanted to work and he had
his sights well set.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount gives much of the credit for his early development to
Cohen, his coach in the Sunrise Little League in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt Clem Cohen was the start of my baseball
career,'' Yount once said. ``It was at the Little League level, but
that was the start. I was very fortunate to get off on the right
foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, my dad was always there for me, but when it came to
the point of playing organized baseball, it was Clem Cohen who got
that ball rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount rose through the Pony League and went on to Taft, where he
was just 5-foot-7 and 135 pounds as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   He started growing late in his junior year, but at times it made
him awkward and he committed 13 errors at short.
</P>
<P>
   But he always had his support group, which included his parents,
Larry and many of the notable players in the area. Dempsey, who
played 24 years in the majors, had gone to Crespi and played on the
same American Legion team as Larry Yount. Robin was the batboy.
</P>
<P>
   Other influences included Rick Auerbach, a Taft product who
later played in the big leagues. Kevin Kennedy, former manager of
the Texas Rangers and Boston Red Sox and now a baseball analyst for
Fox Sports, was a teammate at Taft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always guys around playing ball,'' said Dempsey.
``But I think the biggest change came after his junior year.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Larry Yount was at the Triple-A level for Houston.
He would later reach the majors but hurt his arm warming up in his
first game and had to leave. Larry Yount, now a successful real
estate developer in Phoenix, never made it back to the big leagues
and is believed to be the only pitcher in major-league history to
appear in a game but never throw a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But back in the summer of 1972, Larry invited Robin to go on the
road with him. Robin shagged fly balls and took batting practice.
More importantly, he learned what it was like to be a professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually lived the lifestyle of a minor-league baseball
player,'' Yount said. ``Whether you can handle it or not in the big
leagues _ well, you never know until you go through it. But I had
lived it before I even got into it. So I think in that respect it
was a big advantage to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount started his senior year two inches taller, 20 pounds
heavier and a whole lot wiser. After the season, he was the third
overall pick in the June amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   He played 64 minor-league games in Newark, N.J. In 1974, Brewers
manager Del Crandall made Yount the starting shortstop, five months
before his 19th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, Yount is heading into the Hall of Fame
with lessons that have lasted a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the attitude I wanted to play like it was the last time
I would play the game,'' he said. ``I gave it everything I had
every time I went out there. That's what I'm most proud of.''

MOURNERS PAY RESPECTS TO THIRD VICTIM OF KENNEDY CRASH  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ More than 600 mourners gathered here Saturday
evening to pay respects to Lauren Bessette, the third victim of the
plane crash that also killed John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy just over a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Bessette, 34, was remembered as ``rich, vibrant and
multifaceted'' in a eulogy delivered by her uncle, Jack Messina.
Mourners also recalled her as a successful investment banker and a
lover of opera during a ceremony that lasted just over an hour. The
memorial Mass was held at Christ Church, a neo-Gothic Episcopal
church.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bessette's ashes were dropped into the sea on Thursday along
with those of her sister and Kennedy, who were mourned Friday
during a memorial service on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the crash, Ms. Bessette's life was curiously
both thrust into the open and draped in shadow. Among the three
crash victims, hers was a private life that has been mostly
overlooked as Americans lingered over images of Kennedy and his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, Greenwich turned its attention to Lauren Bessette,
in the place where she was raised and educated. Ms. Bessette and
her twin sister, Lisa Ann, attended Central Junior High and
Greenwich High School. After graduating from high school in 1982,
Lauren Bessette attended Hobart and William Smith Colleges in
Geneva, N.Y., where she majored in economics. In 1991, after
graduating from Wharton School of Business, Ms. Bessette joined
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the investment bank, where she worked
as a financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Ms. Bessette began a four-year stint in the company's
Hong Kong office, rising first to vice president and then to
principal when she returned to Manhattan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As guests began arriving around 5:45 p.m. until the service
began at 7 p.m., photographers called out the names of members of
the Kennedy family and snapped pictures from afar.
</P>
<P>
   In attendance were Ms. Bessette's sister, Lisa Ann, her father,
William Bessette, her mother, Ann Freeman, and her stepfather,
Richard Freeman. Many members of the Kennedy clan also attended,
including Edward M. Kennedy and Caroline Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   In a eulogy for Ms. Bessette, Messina offered the congregants
richly detailed memories about her, including the day she played
miniature golf in her backyard, dressed in pajamas and high heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the events of these past eight days have taught us anything
it is to honor the moment,'' he said. ``Cherish those around you.
Try to find a balance between work and family. Contribute something
to your community, and above all share the love you feel for each
other each and every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Hugh Tudor-Foley, an assistant to the rector at Christ
Church, said that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. read a quote from
Shakespeare during the service and two of Ms. Bessette's friends
offered remembrances. He said that Carole Radziwill delivered a
reading in honor of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tearful and it was joyful and it accomplished what the
family wanted, which was to celebrate the lives of their two
children,'' Turor-Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church, a few Greenwich residents laid flowers on
the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember her as an eclectic and fun person,'' said David
Dall, 35, a classmate of Ms. Bessette's at Greenwich High. ``She
was friends with everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Theo A. Constantine, 38, a member of Greenwich High's class of
1979, said he came to pay his respects to someone the world did not
know very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a community, we need to show our support. The Kennedys have
more than enough support and Carolyn was recognized through them,''
said Constantine. ``The focus hasn't been equal and this is a nice
way to remember Lauren as an individual.''

RESTORING A CENTURY-OLD GLASS TOWER IN CHICAGO  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Six decades ahead of its time, the crystalline
Reliance Building soared skyward in 1895 as a scintillating rebuke
to its somber masonry surroundings, like a diamond in the
rough-hewn Loop.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the late 1950s would Chicago again build an office
tower with so much glass.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Reliance was a decrepit antique, worth more for its
retail space on State and Washington Streets than for the 13 small
floors of offices above. First stripped of its cornice, it was then
stripped of dignity when its delicate terra-cotta facade was
overwhelmed by a neon sign for a discount clothier.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the cornice is back. The terra cotta is crisp and
gleaming again. The clothier is gone, and the tea-leaf reader and
prostitutes who worked upstairs have been replaced by construction
crews.
</P>
<P>
   The Reliance Building is to reopen in September as a 122-room
boutique hotel, the Burnham, named for the architectural firm that
designed it: D.H. Burnham &AMP; Co., best known in New York for the
Flatiron Building.
</P>
<P>
   It is an astonishing transformation. Five years ago, the
Reliance Building ``was on the brink of falling apart,'' Mayor
Richard M. Daley said. The city acquired the landmark building by
eminent domain for $1.2 million and undertook a $6.6-million
exterior rehabilitation intended to jump-start redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   The process was not without critics in the City Council, who
wondered why City Hall was pouring money into a building that
private real estate interests had abandoned. One alderman suggested
using the money to blow up the Reliance Building, allowing the city
to sell the land clear and free.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Daley administration prevailed. More important,
it found a private development team _ the McCaffery Interests,
Mansur &AMP; Co. and the Granite Development Corp. _ willing to
undertake the last $19 million leg of the journey, with $2.5
million more in city assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Although city officials project a return on the investment in
the form of tax revenues and spending, Commissioner Christopher R.
Hill of the Planning and Development Department said the money was
almost beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the economics in the world really don't matter,'' he said.
``This building had to be saved to give people a better
understanding of the history of high-rise architecture in
Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5,500-square-foot floors did not make sense for modern
offices. But Dan McCaffery, president of McCaffery Interests, said,
``When we looked at it, we thought, `My goodness, you could lay
this out in pretty darn good hotel modules.'''
</P>
<P>
   The result _ already apparent on floors where major
reconstruction is nearing completion _ will be a remarkable
interior, with public hallways looking much the way they did a
century ago; not like a hotel at all but like a well-appointed hive
of business.
</P>
<P>
   The original white Carrara marble wainscoting and ceilings are
being kept, as are the mahogany trim, transoms and doors; the
terrazzo floors; the glass partitions (though there are new
fire-resistant walls behind them) and even the doorknobs, mail
slots and ornamental hinges, made of a metal called magnetite with
a coating that yields a blue-black finish.
</P>
<P>
   Winding through the upper floors will be the original open
cast-iron staircase, whose elegant balustrade carries the same
decorative device _ a four-petal Gothic flower, or quatrefoil _
that is used in the undulating ribbons of white terra cotta on the
exterior.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than enclosing this staircase, as current building codes
would require if it were the only means of exit in a fire, the
developers are building two new enclosed stairways through the
building. They also plan to recreate the ornate, two-story-high
elevator lobby.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of the original structural columns _ an open,
diamond-shaped riser built up from riveted steel sections _ will be
left exposed to show how the tower was constructed.
</P>
<P>
   The architects are Antunovich Associates of Chicago, working
with McClier Corp., an architectural and engineering concern based
in Chicago that also prepared a historical structural report on the
Reliance and oversaw the exterior restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Given the deteriorating condition of the terra cotta facade,
there was no time to lose. ``It's amazing that it wasn't raining
off the building,'' said Gunny Harboe, director of preservation at
McClier.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 of the 12,000 terra cotta pieces were replaced. The
cornice was recreated in cast aluminum. And the single layer
plate-glass windows were replaced with double-glazed insulated
windows.
</P>
<P>
   The operator will be the Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group of
San Francisco. In Chicago, Kimpton already runs the 489-room Hotel
Allegro (formerly the Bismarck) and the 193-room Hotel Monaco
(formerly the Oxford House), both downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Elements like the quatrefoil motif are being used in the new
furnishings and textiles, said Susan Caruso, president of
Intra-Spec of Marina del Rey, Calif., which is designing the lobby,
guest rooms and public corridors.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging from 350 to 450 square feet, the rooms are what a
hotelier would call intimate and a guest might call small. Rates
will begin at $145 a night for rooms, $195 for the larger suites.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-foot-high ground floor, originally occupied by the Carson
Pirie Scott &AMP; Co. department store, will become the 65-seat Cafe
Daniel. The tacky commercial accretions of recent decades have been
stripped away. The plan is to recreate the appearance of the
original uninterrupted window wall.
</P>
<P>
   You got the sense that the building was floating on this
double-height story of all glass,'' said Brian Goeken, senior
preservation planner in the landmarks division of the planning
agency. ``It's really going to glow. That's the intent, to play off
this transparency.''
</P>
<P>
   The transparency of the Reliance Building was made possible by
steel-frame construction, which allowed for vast expanses of glass
because exterior walls no longer had to bear the structural load,
as with traditional construction. The central panes in the
second-story bays measure almost 8 by 11 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Big windows were not merely an esthetic gesture. They helped
capture every bit of available daylight. Artificial illumination at
the time consisted of carbon filament bulbs, which gave off an
anemic golden glow not much stronger than candlelight.
</P>
<P>
   What glass-front buildings gained in illumination, however, they
sacrificed in climate control. And so it was not until the
development of modern heating, ventilating and air-conditioning
systems in the 1950s that they proliferated.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest designs for the Reliance Building were by John
Wellborn Root. After his death in 1891, the project was carried to
completion by Charles B. Atwood. The hotel will not carry their
names, however, but that of their more famous partner, Daniel
Hudson Burnham, author of the 1909 Chicago Plan, a sweeping attempt
at taming the chaotic metropolis through the development of orderly
transportation arteries and public amenities like a reclaimed
lakefront.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood does have his admirers. In ``The Chicago School of
Architecture'' (University of Chicago Press, 1964), the
architectural historian Carl W. Condit gave him credit for
extraordinary prescience. ``One short step further in the design of
the Reliance Building and he would have produced the transparent
tower that Mies van der Rohe imagined,'' Condit wrote. ``If any
work of structural art in the 19th century anticipated the future,
it is this one.''

ONE FESTIVAL TOOK THE WOODSTOCK NAME, ANOTHER TRIES TO CAPTURE ITS
SPIRIT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLSDALE, N.Y. _ They traveled from Portland, Ore., and
Hartwood, Va., from Cambridge, England, and Davis, Calif., to erect
a rainbow quilt of dome tents, tarps and tepees across Bob
Brennan's 260-acre farm here on the western fringe of the
Berkshires.
</P>
<P>
   Their minds were set on music, to the exclusion of everything
else. Jody Pierce, 50, an antiques dealer from Rochester, N.Y.,
only just learned of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane crash from a
visitor Thursday night. He had been camped under a lofty oak since
last weekend, building shower stalls and stages in return for a
free festival pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really quite a shock,'' Pierce said, scratching his
sunburned chin.
</P>
<P>
   Music was in the air all around the farm, but this was no
Woodstock '99.
</P>
<P>
   For nine years and counting, this farm, which long ago stopped
producing milk, has been producing music one weekend each summer
with the arrival of the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival. But this is a
far gentler brand of music than that being blasted from
five-story-high speakers at the defunct air base in Rome, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the farm becomes a temporary folk city, raising
the population of Hillsdale from 1,500 to close to 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people arriving for the three-day festival attended
the original Woodstock rock fest that was having its 30-year
anniversary this weekend. But an informal survey of several dozen
campers turned up no one who regretted skipping the extravaganza
100 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every respect, Falcon Ridge '99 appeared to be the
antithesis of Woodstock '99. Commercial tie-ins were limited to
promotions like the Hillsdale Fire Company's $6 pancake breakfast
Sunday morning. The $65 three-day pass was less than half of
Woodstock's.
</P>
<P>
   The main music stage here does not look like a space station.
Its two skinny towers of speakers are intentionally quiet so the
hundreds of amateur singers and pickers swapping songs around
campfires on the ridge above the main field can play without the
scheduled performers interfering.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a mosh pit, it has a folk dance stage, where several
hundred people would soon be shuffling feet to the fiddles of bands
called Wild Asparagus and Big Hoedown.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 people come just for the country dancing, and many
treat the event like a marathon, said Ann Saunders, one of the
festival's producers. ``They only leave the dance floor to carbo
load or make a potty trip,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of 1,250 paid security guards, there were 900
volunteers, including Patrick Vining, 11, from Hartwood, Va., who
wandered in the dark with a friend on Thursday night while his
parents helped set up a sprawling complex of tents in a prime spot
overlooking the stage. It was one of the neatest camps, mainly
because someone had thought to bring a lawn mower to tame the
clover and field grass.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick did not appear bored even after several days without
television and only horses, fields and folk music. ``I'm not into
the Backstreet Boys or much of the new music you hear,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   There were dozens of similar clusters of campers who had come
together over the years through shared musical tastes _ like the 50
tents filled with Dar Williams fans _ or through geography _ like
the Yellow-Head Turtle Club, a group of folk-loving families from
around Pompton Lakes, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   There was no $59.95 pay-per-view simulcast. In fact, the only
chance of catching any of the Falcon Ridge festival on television
would come for viewers in Burlington, Vt. Rick Palieri, who has a
music program on a public-access cable station there, said he was
planning to tape some of the events.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, he was part of the song circle at Camp Vermont,
an informal cluster of folk musicians from the state who convene
every year at the same spot. On ``Sally Ann,'' a traditional fiddle
tune, Palieri flailed the banjo and blew into a droning didgeridoo
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, the farm owner, whose hair is as silvery fine as corn
silk, wandered among the festival-goers, and was repeatedly greeted
and thanked for handing over his farm every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the music's a little slow for me,'' he said. ``But I
never met a folk person who wasn't nice.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF RED: A NOVEL IN VERSE &LR;  By Anne Carson. Vintage
Contemporaries, $12. In this literary hybrid, a poet and scholar
reimagines an ancient Greek myth as a destructive love affair
between Hercules and a winged red monster, who also happens to be a
gifted American boy. ``Carson writes in language any poet would
kill for: sensuous and funny, poignant, musical and tender,'' Ruth
Padel wrote last year in The New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUMMER OF DELIVERANCE: A MEMOIR OF FATHER AND SON &LR;  By
Christopher Dickey. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14. This angry,
affectionate account portrays the author's father, the brilliant
but unstable James Dickey, as a chronic liar and boozer who felt
compelled to reinvent himself every day. Yet Dickey, best known for
his novel ``Deliverance,'' was also a magnetic showman and an
enthusiastic parent who managed to earn the love of his children.
```Summer of Deliverance' contains more sex and violence and
alcohol and celebrity high jinks than a year's worth of tabloids,''
David Kirby wrote in 1998. ``But it contains poetry, too, and a
father-son conflict worthy of the pen of a Sophocles.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OYSTER &LR;  By Janette Turner Hospital. Norton, $14. At the center
of this dreamlike novel, set in a parched mining town in the
Australian outback, are a charismatic cult leader and his
followers, who may or may not be responsible for the disappearance
of strangers who turn up looking for lost sons and daughters. ``It
is both a rare story and an accomplished piece of writing,'' Dale
Peck wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE SERVICE OF CLOUDS &LR; , by Delia Falconer (Picador USA,
$13), a pharmacist's assistant falls in love with a half-mad
photographer who arrives in her frontier outpost in Australia's
Blue Mountains in 1907 to take pictures of clouds. Last year the
reviewer Deirdre McNamer called this first novel ``an exuberant
meditation on the `history of the air,' the art of seeing and the
end of romance as the pre-moderns knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECOLOGY OF FEAR: LOS ANGELES AND THE IMAGINATION OF DISASTER &LR; 
By Mike Davis. Vintage, $14. This fervid polemic on southern
California's alarming natural history _ and the social and
psychological forces it has unleashed _ raised a lot of hackles
among critics who attacked the author's methods and some of his
assertions. Last year the reviewer William Finnegan praised
``Davis' great intellectual breadth and agility.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; PARADISE LOST: CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCE, AMERICA'S FUTURE &LR; ,
by Peter Schrag (University of California, $14.95), a journalist
links the decline in the state's public services and financial
health to the advent of rule by voter initiative. In 1998 in The
New York Times Book Review, Nicholas Lemann called this an ``angry
and persuasive book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAILING ALONE AROUND THE WORLD &LR;  By Joshua Slocum. Edited by
Thomas Philbrick. Penguin, $7.95. The author of this true-life
ripping yarn tells how he braved stormy seas, narrowly escaped
pirates and met the explorer Henry Stanley during his three-year,
46,000-mile circumnavigation in a 40-foot sloop at the turn of the
century. His lively memoir is ``full of interest to lovers of
adventures,'' The New York Times wrote in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUT OF SHEER RAGE: WRESTLING WITH D.H. LAWRENCE &LR;  By Geoff Dyer.
North Point, $13. The author set out to write a scholarly study of
Lawrence but came up instead with this wild, meandering book, which
includes musings on everything from Italian drivers to his own
hatred of seafood. ``Unsystematically and with great humor, it
lights up what really matters to him about his hero,'' Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt wrote in The New York Times last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHITE BOYS: STORIES &LR;  By Reginald McKnight. Owl/Holt, $13. Most
of the characters in these stories are middle-class blacks seeking
to make connections across the color divide, and weary of the
script that society has given them. ``What wins you over ... is
McKnight's attentiveness to the complexities of racial
antagonism,'' Rand Richards Cooper wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BIG CON: THE STORY OF THE CONFIDENCE MAN &LR;  By David W.
Maurer. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95. A linguistics professor explores
the world of grifters and scam artists, and the many means by which
``marks'' (victims) are ``taken off'' (cheated). The book,
originally published in 1940, is ``entertainment for crime
literature addicts'' and ``a textbook for prospective confidence
men,'' Edward Frank Allen wrote in The New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CORDELIA UNDERWOOD: OR, THE MARVELOUS BEGINNINGS OF THE
MOOSEPATH LEAGUE &LR;  By Van Reid. Penguin, $12.95. This genial first
novel, which takes place in Maine in 1896, has to do with a young
woman who inherits some land from her seafaring uncle, but it's
laced with red herrings and a bunch of eccentric locals with
stories of their own. ``Reid's gazillion characters sparkle,'' Kit
Reed wrote in 1998. ``Escapists will be charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CLAIRVOYANT &LR;  By Marian Thurm. Harper Paperbacks, $6.50.
Victor Mackenzie is a psychic loose cannon who can't control what
he sees and who longs for a little mystery in his life. He gets his
wish when he gazes at the palm of a single mother whose future
involves not only her but him. In 1997 the reviewer Peter Lefcourt
called this an ``entertaining novel.''
