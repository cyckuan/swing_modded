HOW EIGHT WORDS CHANGED OHIO STATE
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fivemonths ago, before Ohio State plopped on the
college basketball couch and Jim O'Brien was named Big Ten Coach of
the Year for engineering the greatest turnaround in conference
history, a fellow named Scoonie uttered eight words that shocked
Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make the NCAA Tournament,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His coach cringed, reporters cackled, and the campus wondered if
someone had forgotten to dot his ``i.'' Ohio State in the NCAA
Tournament? In 1999? The Buckeyes hadn't had a winning season in
five years, much less participated in the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in Ohio thought I was crazy,'' junior guard James
``Scoonie'' Penn said.
</P>
<P>
   But Scoonie was money, and here they are _ facing No.1 seed
Auburn tonight in the South Regional Sweet 16 in Knoxville, Tenn.,
one year after they won eight games and endured a 17-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   From 1-15 to 12-4 _ the greatest turnaround in Big Ten
Conference history. All because of eight words that rocked a
program from its slumbering past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought Scoonie was far-fetched at the beginning,'' Ohio
State junior forward George Reese said. ``But we needed our point
guard to be a leader and give us some confidence. We started to
believe, then we started winning.''
</P>
<P>
   It figures it took two transfers to do it, two people with no
connections to Ohio State's troubled past: O'Brien, who joined the
Buckeyes after a tumultuous tenure at Boston College; and Penn, the
former Eagles star who followed O'Brien, sat out last season and
recently was named Big Ten Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Add Michael Redd, a smooth forward who last year became the
first freshman to lead the Big Ten in scoring, 6-foot-11 center Ken
Johnson, who has given the Buckeyes a presence in the pivot, a slew
of local kids eager to rebuild the state's once-proud program _ and
it's little wonder Ohio State (25-8) stood with Auburn and
Wisconsin as the regular season's biggest surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes entered the top-25 poll Jan. 11 for the first time
in six years, eventually finished second in the Big Ten to Michigan
State and earned a No.4 seed. Last week, in their first NCAA
Tournament appearance since 1992, they dispatched Murray State and
Detroit to advance to the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, after the Buckeyes lost the Midwest regional finals to
Michigan's Fab Five, star forward Jimmy Jackson bolted for the NBA.
The Buckeyes slowly disintegrated under coach Randy Ayres, who won
15, 13, 6, 10 and 10 games over the next five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Boston College, O'Brien directed the Eagles to
three tournament appearances in 11 years, including a fabulous run
in 1994 when they slayed No. 1 seed North Carolina. He had finally
established Boston College as New England's team in 1996 when the
admissions department tightened its grip and rejected the
applications of two top Boston recruits, Elton Tyler and Jonathan
DePina. (Both were eligible under NCAA rules.)
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien won the Big East title in 1997, but with local high
school coaches and players rebelling, he fled to Columbus. Penn
followed a few months later, and together they hunkered down for a
season beyond imagination.
</P>
<P>
   With O'Brien on a preseason golf trip in Scotland, three players
were arrested within 72 hours. Another was lost for the season to a
back injury. A widower who spent two months living in a hotel,
O'Brien then dismissed three players and had just seven on
scholarship when the 1997-98 season began. The Buckeyes lost their
first 14 conference games and spent each day waiting for the season
to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach keeps reminding us of where we've come from,'' reserve
Shamar Herron said. ``He wants us to stay hungry, and it isn't
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The climb from there to here began last summer, when O'Brien
reloaded with five recruits. He welcomed Penn, the floor leader OSU
lacked, and he settled a lawsuit with Boston College in which he
claimed mismanagement in rejecting the recruits. His life was
starting to coalesce when Penn popped off in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to tone it down a little, but he kept talking
about the NCAAs all year long,'' O'Brien said. ``All we tried to do
was win the next game, then re-evaluated our goals as we went
along. I thought Scoonie was stretching it a little. I was looking
for a middle ground. This program had had five consecutive losing
seasons. You can't go from that to the NCAA Tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now.

PEPPERDINE RALLY ENOUGH (AGAIN)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The Pepperdine baseball team is getting ahead
these days by falling behind. What else could explain the best
start in school history?
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the sixth-ranked Waves trailed early against UCLA,
rallied for a comfortable lead and then held on to beat the Bruins
7-6 in a nonconference game at Eddy D. Field Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (21-2) has won 11 of 12 and notched its 12th
come-from-behind victory of the season. Freshman outfielder Woody
Cliffords, whose clutch hitting helped El Camino Real High win the
past two L.A. City Section championships, hit a leadoff home run,
his second of the season, in the bottom of the seventh to break a
6-6 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Cliffords also had an RBI single in the third and lifted his
average to .392.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a slider,'' Cliffords said of his homer, which
came off left-handed reliever Bobby Roe. ``I'm a smarter hitter
now. In high school, I wouldn't swing at breaking balls early in
the count. I'm learning that sometimes I'm only going to get one
good pitch to hit in each at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliffords is also playing left field for the first time in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Cliffords) is doing a great job,'' Waves coach Frank Sanchez
said. ``A big reason we are where we are is because of Woody.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine began the season unranked. Now, only one Division I
team in the nation _ 17-1 North Carolina - has fewer losses than
the Waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to win, regardless of the first couple of innings,''
Pepperdine senior third baseman G.J. Raymundo said. ``We just find
a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggling Bruins (15-17) took a 2-0 lead in the third off
Pepperdine starter Steve Schenewerk. The Waves responded with four
runs in the bottom of the inning off UCLA right-hander Jon Brandt,
the Bruins' winningest pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Raymundo hit a two-run homer, his team-leading eighth, to
highlight the rally.
</P>
<P>
   After Pepperdine took a 6-2 lead, UCLA scored twice in the sixth
and twice in the seventh to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine junior right-hander Jay Gehrke pitched a shaky ninth
but ended up striking out the side to pick up his 11th save, tying
a school record.

MEXICAN MILITARY POLICE ARREST ARMY DISSIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A fugitive dissident army officer who has publicly
accused the armed forces of justice abuses was arrested on
Wednesday by military police, the Defense Ministry announced.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Hildegardo Bacilio Gomez, a 43-year-old army surgeon,
was detained in the main square of his hometown, the city of
Pachuca in central Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with sedition, insubordination and defaming the
armed forces, which are among the most serious crimes under the
military code. He had been in hiding since December.
</P>
<P>
   Bacilio led about 50 soldiers in a march down Mexico City's
central boulevard last Dec. 18 to protest what they called unfair
and heavy-handed treatment by the justice system of Mexico's highly
secretive armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first open challenge by a dissident movement to
military leaders since the turbulent decades at the beginning of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   The colonel, with 23 years of service in the army, claimed that
he had been hounded by military justice because of a 1996 incident
in which he left his post at an army hospital to give emergency
medical care to a civilian in a private clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The government has reacted sharply to the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Five other officers who attempted to deliver a letter of protest
to President Ernesto Zedillo's offices on Jan. 5 were also arrested
and charged with sedition. In a speech on annual Army Day in
February, Zedillo called the dissident soldiers ``buffoons.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he has been on the run, Bacilio has continued to give
press interviews and send broadsides by fax to news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we asking for from the military courts,'' he said in
an interview published this week in a Mexican political magazine,
``is just that they be honest and fair. We don't seek to abolish
the military system, we just want to modernize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Military leaders have noted that Bacilio is facing a series of
earlier charges for desertion and insubordination and have called
his public dissent a gross violation of military discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other soldiers in the movement have also run afoul
of military justice.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed that army commanders charged them with military
infractions out of personal vengeance or arbitrary use of power.

ENERGY SECRETARY ANNOUNCES STEPS TO TIGHTEN SECURITY AT NUCLEAR
LABS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to recast 3rd and 4th grafs)  (sw) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department has begun an internal
investigation into accusations that its chief of intelligence was
improperly barred from briefing Congress last year about
allegations that China stole data from a nuclear weapons
laboratory, Secretary Bill Richardson announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The department's inspector general, Greg Friedman, will review
whether Elizabeth Moler, who was acting energy secretary at the
time, prevented Notra Trulock, then the intelligence chief, from
giving information about possible Chinese espionage to the House
Select Committee on Intelligence in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation announced on Wednesday comes about 10 days
after an article in The New York Times led to broad criticism of
how the administration handled evidence that China had stolen
nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   According to the article, Trulock contended that Ms. Moler had
prevented him from briefing the House panel because the information
could have been used to criticize President Clinton's policy on
China.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moler has said she does not recall the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also announced six other steps intended to improve
security at nuclear weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony on Wednesday to the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence, he said his department would ask for $8 million more
in next year's counterintelligence budget for a new computer
security program for systems at the labs, which are owned by the
Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   The department also plans to invest in systems to analyze
sensitive e-mail leaving the labs and other Energy Department
facilities, and will impose stricter controls on laboratory
documents that contain data on weapons design.
</P>
<P>
   With the new request for funds for electronic security, the
department is seeking to increase its counterintelligence budget
for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, to $39.2 million, more than
double last year's spending.
</P>
<P>
   In response to widespread criticism of the failure of the labs
to conduct background checks on thousands of visitors from
so-called sensitive countries like China, Russia and Iran, John
Deutch, the former director of central intelligence, is to review
the security of the visitors' programs.
</P>
<P>
   His review will be in addition to the broader assessment of the
case being conducted by the CIA and an outside panel led by David
Jeremiah, a retired admiral.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the department will report annually to Congress
on its foreign visitors and its counterintelligence efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The department's office of counterintelligence also plans an
extensive review of old investigative files in order to identify
cases that should be examined further.

ST. PAT'S PARADE ENTERTAINS KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE LAMOY and LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ St. Patty himself wouldn't have prayed for a
nicer day for Wednesday's 26th Annual St. Patrick's Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   It came outfitted with a warming sun, a blue dome of Midwestern
sky, a light breeze and, organizers estimated, more than 200,000
attendees who jammed Grand Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   People showed up early. By 10:30 a.m., more than an hour before
the parade began, crowds jostled for curbside positions.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrators dressed in goofy hats and T-shirts with silly
slogans and sported shamrocks pasted and painted on cheeks, arms
and heads. By the time the parade began, the crowds were 14 deep on
sidewalks, spilling onto the street, from Pershing Road to Sixth
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The street was alive with noise: bullhorns and sirens, children
shouting, helicopter blades whipping the sky, police motorcycles
rumbling by. It was classic parade ambience _ and it delivered a
giant street party.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting to begin, Sgt. Robert Espino from the New Orleans Marine
Corps Band hoisted his 45-pound gold sousaphone off his shoulders.
His white gloves flashed in the sunlight as he straightened his
white sash over his black uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, this does get heavy,'' he said. ``But I'm used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   A block away, Kathie Richard prepared to herd nine sheep down
the parade route. She worried about the herd dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be crazy to be here,'' she said, watching a group of
children pet her sheep. ``If the dogs flank too wide and get under
the wheel of a car...'' Her voice trailed off as she shuddered. She
soon dropped out of the parade when a dog was nearly hit by a truck
hauling a man in a rat suit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 11:40 a.m., a boom sounded, and a kelly green billow
of smoke poured onto Grand. A lone bagpiper, Jodie Watson, began to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the corner of Grand and Pershing, Pat Hughes,
wearing a ballcap that said ``The Boss'' on it, pointed his
bullhorn at the waiting Marine band.
</P>
<P>
   ``United States Marines,'' he barked, sweeping one hand in front
of him, ``the streets of Kansas City are yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Drums rolled, and the band began the opening bars to a Sousa
march. The parade awoke, lurching forward like a giant centipede
with nearly 200 entries. The displays ranged from those as simple
as pickup trucks with green fringe, to one with a three-story
helium-filled fox balloon, to one celebrating Irish police officers
that featured a circling airplane.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the massive crowd and the chaotic atmosphere, there
were no catastrophes. Police reported that eight persons were
arrested for fighting. And there was one injury involving a
9-year-old girl who bruised her left knee when she ran into a
motorcycle driven by a police officer, said Kansas City Police Maj.
Joseph McHale. The girl fell but didn't require medical treatment,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the floats, bands, dancing groups and funky cars tooled by,
mothers fed babies, boyfriends kissed girlfriends, and drinking
buddies shouted and whooped.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing up the end of the parade was Ken Henderson and a
menagerie of five snakes, a Great Dane//Labrador dog named Lady,
and Rosco, a red rooster.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson walked behind a beat-up old station wagon with an
albino Burmese python, Buttercup, draped over his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to drive the snakes out of Ireland,'' he shouted
to the dwindling crowd, apparently in reference to the legend of
St. Patrick driving snakes from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered, screamed and clapped at everything that moved
down the parade route, whether it was the Marching Cobras drill
team or truckloads of Irish American families or even parade
volunteers in golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   Around 2:30 p.m. the first parade was over and another began.
More than a dozen mechanized street sweepers from American Sweeping
Inc. worked their way north on Grand, clearing the discarded and
blowing cans, bottles, bags and miles of silly string, sucking up
debris in figure eights, avoiding one another with the grace of
dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, you couldn't even tell a party had happened.

POSTURING FOR AN NFL PARTNERSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With six months to put together a single Los
Angeles football franchise bid, rival camps made tentative
overtures Wednesday about opening what promise to be difficult
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the New Coliseum Partners and Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas voiced confidence their proposal to remodel the
Coliseum would be successful and urged competitor Michael Ovitz,
the entertainment agent, to join them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Magic Johnson, who is part of the Ovitz team's
plan to build a stadium and mall in Carson, said he believed the
two groups should join forces as soon as possible _ even before an
NFL site selection committee comes out within the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have unity and soon,'' Johnson said. ``I think in
the next week or so we can have some talks. Everyone brings
something to the table, If we join forces, we are stronger than if
we are apart.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, NFL owners agreed to award a franchise but set tough
conditions for a unified proposal, finalized financial support and
broad public and business support under a six-month timetable or
the franchise would be awarded to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The decision pressured both bidders in Los Angeles to begin
talks but Ovitz aide Peter Levin said no timetable has been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, we are thrilled for Los Angeles,'' Levin
said. ``We achieved this part of the goal collectively. We are
taking our lead from league officials and look forward to discuss
the procedures for the next step as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson reminded officials that Ovitz and Ridley-Thomas had
worked together early on in trying to see professional football
back in the city, but broke ranks when Ovitz became convinced the
league would not place a third professional football team in the
Coliseum after the experiences of the Rams and the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would take that much to get us working
together again,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Eli Broad and Ed Roski of the New
Coliseum partners said they would do whatever it takes to see
football returned _ including a surrender of its exclusive
negotiating rights for the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to say that we want it at the Coliseum and if
they have another group, we're not going to stand in the way,''
Broad said in a telephone interview from New York City. ``If
someone wants to pay more and is local, we won't stand in the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   As for joining forces with Ovitz and food magnate Ron Burkle,
Broad described himself as a friend of both men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see them part of this,'' Broad said. ``I have
said that all along.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step, he added, is for the Coliseum to be selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once that happens, I am convinced the ownership group will
expand to show the NFL there is the support for a football team
here,'' Broad said.
</P>
<P>
   John Semcken, who represents Roski, said he didn't anticipate a
problem over the exclusivity agreement that the Coliseum gave
Roski.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal is to have a strong local ownership group that's
concerned about Los Angeles,'' Semcken said. ``We've been burned
before and we want to make sure the new owners _ whether it's us or
someone else _ (are) committed to the city and what's best for our
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Semcken said Roski and Broad were prepared to make sure the NFL
doesn't feel it is being forced to select them as the new owners of
an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is solely the NFL's decision to decide who its partners are
going to be as a new owner,'' Semcken said.
</P>
<P>
   David Carter, a principal with the Sports Business Group that
works on professional sports, said he sees it as important for the
two sides to resolve any differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL doesn't want to get involved in local politics, but
any local bickering would be of concern to the owners,'' Carter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley-Thomas said he was convinced professional football would
return to the Coliseum.
</P>

CONGRESS TO KEEP PUSHING FOR FEDERAL JUDGES TO DISCLOSE ASSETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE STEPHENS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congressional leaders vowed Wednesday to continue pushing for
broader disclosure of the assets of federal judges despite
opposition by the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators were surprised and dismayed that the U.S. Judicial
Conference this week rejected a plan calling for judges to post
lists of their stock holdings at their local courthouses, for
anyone to see. Reformers had promoted the plan as a way to reduce
illegal conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges should join lawmakers and other high-level government
officials in disclosing their financial holdings,'' said Sen.
Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican and chairman of a subcommittee
that oversees federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to let the sun shine in on our system of
government. I'd like to see the judicial conference revisit this
issue as part of their commitment to accountability in the judicial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers said they were considering a second round of
hearings on the issue, but added it is too soon to set a course of
action.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is the principal policy-making body for the
federal courts. Although it approved some ethics reforms Tuesday,
the conference voted against broader financial disclosure, saying
judges considered it an invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was felt this was just another imposition on judges,'' said
Judge W. Terrell Hodges, chairman of the conference's executive
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The plan arose in response to a series published last year in
The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   The series, ``On Their Honor,'' showed that federal judges in
the Kansas City area and elsewhere presided over scores of lawsuits
against companies in which they owned stock. The newspaper's
investigation identified more than 300 court orders entered by
judges who had a financial interest in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area alone, two-thirds of the federal judges
had presided over at least one lawsuit involving a company in which
they owned stock.
</P>
<P>
   Although judges list their investments on annual disclosure
reports, the series showed how the judiciary placed tight
restrictions on their release. The reports are stored only in
Washington, the judiciary releases them only after a lengthy
administrative process and each request sparks a warning to the
judge about who is investigating the holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The Star also found that more than a third of the reports were
incomplete or contained errors.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican and a ranking member
of the judiciary committee, was a vocal supporter of the reform
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terribly disappointed,'' Ashcroft said Wednesday of the
conference's actions. ``The current policy governing disclosure of
judges' financial information makes it difficult and intimidating
for the public to help monitor judges' compliance with ethics
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only when the public has full access to this information can
we be confident that judges will be held to the highest and best
standard possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges in western Missouri agree. After The Star's series, they
decided to file lists of their investments at the courthouse in
Kansas City. They will continue to do so despite the conference's
vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Across Capitol Hill, Rep. Howard Coble said he was weighing
whether his committee should reexamine the issue. The North
Carolina Republican heads a subcommittee on court oversight that
questioned Hodges about the conflicts at a hearing last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a mistake,'' Coble said of the conference's
decision. ``This seemed to me a perfect opportunity for them to
have come forward and said, `It's been wrong in the past, and the
perception is we have something to hide. We are going to open the
door.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is innately suspicious when you attempt to conceal
information this is, in fact, their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates called on Congress to hold new hearings and
consider remedial legislation. James C. Turner, a Washington lawyer
and legal reformer, argued it is important to demonstrate that
judges are accountable to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are supposed to be publicly available records,'' Turner
said of the disclosure reports. ``To ignore the clear intent of the
law, especially when you are a judge, raises questions about their
ability to interpret the law in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The judicial conference meets twice a year at the Supreme Court.
The chief justice serves as presiding officer of the 27-member
group.

UCLA'S GOMEZ UNLIKELY TO RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The topic hasn't been mentioned much because she's
just a junior athletically. But Erica Gomez might not be long for
the UCLA women's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, the Bruins' point guard, is considering this season to be
her last.
</P>
<P>
   First, she is a senior academically and will graduate in June.
Second, she misses her New Jersey home.
</P>
<P>
   Third, she doesn't expect the WNBA to come calling because she
didn't have the breakout season she wanted. She averaged 7.4 points
and seven assists per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be a role player,'' she said, ``and I don't
imagine people saying, `Oh, she could do so much for a WNBA team.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she recognizes the NCAA Tournament, in which the Bruins
play Colorado State in a Sweet 16 matchup Saturday at the Sports
Arena, is a place where stock can rise in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   After the season ends, she will meet and discuss her future with
coach Kathy Olivier. Gomez said Olivier, who was unavailable for
comment, knows of the situation and has been grooming Crescenta
Valley High graduate Michelle Greco to take over and recruiting a
point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I graduate in June either way,'' Gomez said. ``They know my
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Only organized games, please: Maylana Martin leads the Bruins
with an 18.6-point and a 9.3-rebound average, but she's no gym rat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play, but I don't like pickup games,'' she said.
``All the other girls will go to the Wooden Center, but I won't.''
</P>
<P>
   The origins of her disdain are twofold. As an eighth-grader, she
played in a park and blocked a guy's shot.
</P>
<P>
   The next time down the court, she went up for the shot and he
tackled her.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as a post player, Martin's game relies on her receiving
passes from teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to do that in a pickup game?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   All alone: The players realize they're the only Pacific-10 team
_ men or women _ to remain alive in the NCAAs (The Cal and Oregon
men are still in the NIT).
</P>
<P>
   Yet what they hear around campus isn't praise for the
accomplishment. Rather, it's surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear, `Wow! Can you believe it? The women's team is the
only one left,' '' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Post player Carly Funicello can believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people tell me, `In three years, you'll be better
than the men,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance woes: The Bruins thought winning would fill Pauley
Pavilion. Instead, less than 3,000 turned out for each of the two
games there. ESPN showed the near-empty arena several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we have to do,'' Martin said. ``We're
winning, but that's not the answer. Maybe we have to start dunking
or shave our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that the two games started at 9 p.m. and UCLA
markets itself to children.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA tickets available: As of Wednesday evening, 4,300 tickets
had been sold for this weekend's NCAA West Regional finals at the
Sports Arena. Lower-level tickets can be purchased for Saturday's
and Monday's games for $30, which covers both sessions. Upper-level
seats are $25. Youth tickets for children ages 12-and-under are
$12. For information, call (213) 740-GOSC.

NCAA'S  CINDERELLA ERA OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - College basketball shimmers on the surface. But like
the rest of the student-athlete mirage, it's best to avoid the
crawl space and closets.
</P>
<P>
   It works on the floor, not under the microscope. Not with forged
homework and coaches who view ethics as a pack of chewing gum, and
the guy who blows the biggest bubble wins. Not with point-shaving
scandals, on-line gambling, Proposition 16.
</P>
<P>
   Yet amid the weeds, a flower has sprouted. And it's no mistake,
no great upset that a few unexpected outfits have arrived at
America West Arena. They are simply the petals of parity popping up
in the strangest places.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri State. Miami of Ohio. Florida of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa. Oklahoma. And the quirkiest of all, Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Florida Coach Billy Donovan warned. ``Gonzaga will be a
top 20 team next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA would like to take credit for this, and in some ways,
it can. The proliferation of conference tournaments probably helped
toughen up Iowa, Ohio State, Purdue and Michigan State. And the
lack of one is probably why the Pac-10 plummeted like a paper
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   A reduction in scholarships from 15 to 13 has helped spread the
wealth and is the only reason that Gonzaga's Matt Santangelo is
here and Stanford is out of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they reduced scholarships, big schools couldn't take
everybody,'' Gonzaga Coach Dan Monson said. ``If there were still
15 scholarships, Matt would be at Stanford today. It was between
him and Arthur Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   But a part of it is dumb luck. And for all the hand-wringing
about underclassmen who bolt for the NBA, the steppingstone
mentality pervasive in college basketball might have its benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The great players go to the signa ture schools. They leave
before unpacking their hot plates. After a while, the dynasties are
ruptured, if not disbanded. And while it happens, the continuity in
lesser programs narrows the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Dean Smith would've hung around if Kobe Bryant wanted a
diploma. Michigan would've made the tournament with a senior named
Kevin Garnett. Kansas would look a lot different with the presence
of Paul Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have the dominant college players staying in school
a very long time,'' said Donovan, a former Princeton star, part of
an era when Cinderella lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, the guys that were hardship would only leave after
their junior year. I remember Pearl Washington leaving Syracuse
after his junior year, and that was about it. Now, you have guys
going directly from high school to the pros, and the ones who don't
stay one year, maybe two.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is any lack of suspense surrounding the tournament, any
reason why the television ratings are down, it's because of an
impending coronation. But Duke is largely an anomaly, a superstar
blip, the kind of team that's almost impossible to build these
days. The other 63 you can put in a hopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard someone say we were the team that rolled through the
Big East Tournament,'' Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun said. ``He
must've missed that Thursday when we beat Seton Hall 57-56.''
</P>
<P>
   And who'd have thought that, in order to reach the Elite Eight,
Florida would have to beat Pennsylvania, Weber State and Gonzaga?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's parity all the way through college
basketball,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in terms of glamour appeal, we could've done better.
We could've landed Stanford and North Carolina and called it a home
run. But that's not reality any longer.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, the combined seeding of the four teams totals 22. In
the East, it's 29. In the Midwest, it's 27.
</P>
<P>
   So pick a team. Cheer for Iowa and Dr. Tom Davis before the exit
door hits him in the backside. He is worth cheering for, a lame
duck coach getting pushed out of a job at age 60, involved in a
messy spat with his own administration. On Tuesday, they finally
got around to sending Davis and his kids a note of congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   Or be a Gon-Zagnut, a team that comes closest to the glass
slipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you have to give us a label because you've never
heard about us before,'' Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for Cinderella.
</P>
<P>
   She's gone. Entered the draft a few years ago. &QL;

DALE ELLIS GIVING SONICS, AND YOUNGER DEFENDERS, ALL THEY WANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dale Ellis' career-high in scoring is 53 points. The
most field goals he ever made in 48 minutes is 20, and nine is his
single-game high for 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   So why did the Sonics' veteran swingman recently demand the game
ball for connecting on the only shot he took during a win at
Chicago?
</P>
<P>
   ``I took one shot and was happy,'' Ellis said. ``They tried to
take (the ball) away from me, but I brought it back to Seattle. I
had one shot and made it. I was happy we won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning is all that matters to Ellis these days.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about the torrid streak he's sewed together from 3-point
land, and Ellis is unimpressed. He's hit 23 of his last 39 treys
(59 percent), yet Ellis says, ``I'm not shooting the way I want to
shoot it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about cracking the starting lineup at small forward, and
Ellis is indifferent. He often jokes about his distaste for
starting because there aren't as many shots playing with Vin Baker
and Gary Payton, whereas he can be the first or second option off
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a young player anymore,'' he said. ``I don't care if I
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings you to Ellis' age. He is 38 years old and shooting
so well that every night he dares a youngster to match his
productivity. Sonics coach Paul Westphal doesn't know if he will
ever repress Ellis' role.
</P>
<P>
   For as much that has been made about Vin Baker's resurrection,
the Sonics feel lucky to have the oldest starter in the league. Ask
Ellis about that, and he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to re-do my contract,'' the 15-year veteran joked.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Ellis has been money well spent by the Sonics this
season, especially since he's been thrust into a starting role
because of Billy Owens' knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis will likely start even when Owens gets healthy. As for
there not being enough shots for him with the starters, that's
bogus, says Westphal, who is amazed by Ellis' productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always want to look for him. I hate to see him open and not
get the ball,'' Westphal said. ``He's proven that he delivers. So
if you have a shooter with his abilities, you want to set picks for
him and you want to put in him position where his man has to help,
where he'll get shots. We want to play to everybody's strength, and
his strength is certainly evident.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two games he's started, Ellis has averaged nearly 16
points, shooting 52 percent from the floor and making 6 of 10
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 games, which included three starts, Ellis has
made 46 of 92 shots (50 percent) overall and 26 of 46 3-pointers
(56 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in with the attitude that I'd play any role I was asked
to play,'' Ellis said. ``I'm not a young player who's looking to
get minutes and points to prove himself. My concern is winning
basketball games.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the fact that his family is rooted here, Ellis still
sees Seattle as the place to win a title. His best chance was
during his first year with the 1986-87 Sonics, who lost to the L.A.
Lakers in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ellis' deft shooting is almost as much of a fixture
here as the Space Needle. From 1986-91, he played his best
basketball in a Sonics uniform when he averaged 24.6 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   He was a big part of the team's 61-win season a year ago. And
before Ellis signed a three-year contract this past offseason, he
had several suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Portland pursued the sharp shooter hard. And when the Sonics
played the Lakers at KeyArena last month, Del Harris, who then
coached the Lakers, told Ellis how interested they were this
pastoff season but couldn't work out the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to finish here,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis credits Westphal's offensive philosophy for invigorating
him this season. Under Westphal, everyone on the floor has the
green light to shoot if open. Westphal's concern is playing Ellis
too many minutes.
</P>
<P>
   No worry, Ellis says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still at the point where I actually feel like if I'm
contributing during the course of a game, I can run all day and not
get tired,'' he said. ``I get tired when I run up and down the
court, and I feel like I'm just out there. I felt like that a lot
last year. But it's a lot easier to knock down shots knowing you're
going to get X amount of shots and knowing you're going to get
plays run for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun, and I'm enjoying winning.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Owens scrimmaged with the team Wednesday for the first
time in four days, but his status is day-to-day and he remains
doubtful for Friday's game at Golden State because of a sore left
knee.

HOW WEST MIGHT BE WON: KEEP EYE ON THESE PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - As much as the team concept is paramount in college
basketball, we can't help but keep our eyes fixed on that special
player, the one or two (or in Duke's case, seven or eight) who
stand out, either through sheer talent, sheer will or a combination
of both. Individuals, in other words, who make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gonzaga has 10 players and all of them play. The
you-can-call-them-the-Zags-but-don't-call-them-Cinderella Bulldogs
might be as balanced as anyone in the Sweet 16. Four of their
players made All-West Coast Conference. But they have come this far
largely on the strength of their guards, Matt Santangelo and
Quentin Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which plays Gonzaga tonight in the first game at
America West Arena, is sort of the same. Ten players average at
least 10 minutes a game. Five score in double figures. The Gators
are known for talented freshmen like Mike Miller and Teddy Dupay.
But for inspiration and leadership, they look toward senior guard
Eddie Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration and leadership? Iowa is loaded with seniors, and one
of them, forward Jess Settles, is in graduate school and his sixth
season of eligibility after battling back from injuries. Another
senior, guard Kent McCausland, is a deadly three-point shooter who
helped bring the Hawkeyes back last week against Arkansas. But for
youthful spark and flash, the Hawkeyes have sophomore point guard
Dean Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa's opponent in the second game, Connecticut, is the most
talented team in the field. Who stands out? Let's see. Forward
Richard Hamilton is a first-team All-American. Point guard Khalid
El-Amin runs the show with flair. Forward Kevin Freeman is as solid
as Camelback Mountain. Center Jake Voskuhl provides the inside
presence and guard Ricky Moore is a nasty defender. The bench is
pretty good, too.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo, a 6-foot-1 junior, leads Gonzaga in assists and is
No. 2 in scoring. But he had to withstand a difficult switch from
the point to off-guard because Hall turned out to be so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I understood that role and I accepted it, that's when I
started to have more success as a player,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall is a 5-8 senior, a Bahamas native who somehow found his way
first to North Idaho College and then to Yakima Valley College in
Washington state before ending up in Spokane, Wash. He started just
one game last year. But he improved so much, learning to harness
his quickness, he forced his way into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken Quentin almost a year and a half to get comfortable
to where we don't have a point guard and we don't have an
off-guard,'' Gonzaga Coach Dan Monson said. ``We have two good
guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon averages 6.8 points a game, but forget that. Look
instead at his team-high 132 assists and his 50 steals that put him
atop the school career chart. Then look past those numbers at
what's inside.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-11 senior, Shannon is blind in his right eye. He was hit
with a rock while in the seventh grade, and his vision slowly
deteriorated. In October, he was fitted with a prosthesis. Last
week, he earned a national award for courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``His accomplishments,'' Florida Coach Billy Donovan said, ``are
completely unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   One who did hear about Shannon when he was a star at Cardinal
Newman High School in West Palm Beach, Fla., was Arizona Coach Lute
Olson, who offered Shannon a scholarship. Shannon accepted. Then he
made one last visit, to Florida. And then he changed his mind. So
Olson offered the scholarship intended for Shannon to a Seattle kid
named Jason Terry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything worked out,'' Shannon said. ``Those guys (Arizona)
were very successful. We struggled a couple of years, but we're at
the point now where anything can happen, and we're playing good
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   McCausland, the gunner, and Settles, the foot soldier, are
wrapping up their Iowa careers along with deposed Coach Tom Davis.
Whoever replaces Davis will inherit an emerging star, Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Denver, Oliver raised himself from the near-dead,
overcoming the flu to rack up 15 points and six assists in 19
minutes as the Hawkeyes beat Alabama-Birmingham in the first round.
Healthier two days later, he had 17 points, four assists and just
two turnovers in a helter-skelter game as Iowa beat Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver also put his signature on the game with a 360-degree
spin, behind-the-back, half-court pass to Settles that resulted in
a big basket down the stretch. It was a dead-solid play of the
week, replayed countless times. But Oliver, a 5-11 sophomore,
watched it only once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that impressed,'' he said, laughing. ``It didn't seem
like anything no one else could do. It was just a
spur-of-the-moment move.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn is the team of the moment. Everyone knows about Hamilton,
the slashing scorer, and El-Amin, the animated, flashy floor
leader. Freeman is someone you should know about, too. Points?
Rebounds? Defense?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the team needs on that given day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A junior, Freeman is a healthy 6-7, 235-pounds. But he sometimes
labored in his teammates' shadows. Not in the Big East Tournament,
though, when he was named Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most underrated players in the country,''
Hamilton said. ``Without him, we wouldn't have won as many games as
we won. He does a lot of things.'' &QL;

EARLY DEPAR TURES TO NBA TAKE BIG TOLL ON CONTENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It didn't have to be Duke and the Little 63.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA tournament could have had several title contenders _
Wally's World is a nice little story, but champions? Come on. _ had
underclassmen not dashed for the big cash.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit 1: North Carolina. The Tar Heels likely would have been
as feared as the Blue Devils had Antawn Jamison and Vince Carter
not turned pro early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Duke would have beaten North Carolina by 20 on
North Carolina's floor,'' said Suns Senior Executive Vice President
Cotton Fitzsimmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this: Duke wouldn't have beaten (North Carolina) three
times,'' Arizona State Coach Rob Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels, knocked out of the West Regional by Weber State
in a first-round upset, aren't the only team damaged by
underclassmen turning pro.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit 2: Kansas. The Jayhawks were ousted in the second round.
They seemingly would still be playing if they still had forward
Paul Pierce, who could wind up as the NBA Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit 3: Arizona. If Mike Bibby stays past his sophomore year,
the chances of the Wildcats being stunned by Oklahoma in the first
round grow much more remote.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for an explanation of why the tournament has followed
such a wacky course so far this year? You may have hit upon
something here.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the upsets going on this season, you can trace some
of them to the early departures of college players to the NBA,'' UA
Coach Lute Olson said. ``There has been a lot of change in the
rosters of some of the traditional powers, and it has made for a
tournament that is more unpredictable than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Unpredictable isn't the word.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight of the top 16 seeds remain in the NCAA tournament,
the fewest since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Three No. 10 seeds still are alive, including Gonzaga, which
plays Florida in a West Region semifinal round game tonight at
America West Arena. The other No. 10 seeds still playing are Purdue
and Miami (Ohio), led by Wally ``World'' Szczerbiak, who scored 67
points in his first two NCAA Tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think reality has quite set in that we're still one of
16 schools playing while North Carolina, Utah, Stanford and UCLA
are home,'' Gonzaga guard Ryan Floyd said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami, Southwest Missouri State _ we're all in this together.
We're clearly for each other. We're the underdogs. Everyone pulls
for the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   The underdogs aren't all young pups.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga starts two seniors and two juniors. Miami of Ohio starts
three seniors and two juniors. Southwest Missouri State doesn't
have a sophomore or a freshman in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, meanwhile, replaced Jamison and Carter in its
lineup with freshmen Kris Lang and Jeff Capel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be a veteran team if those guys still were here,'' Tar
Heels Coach Bill Guthridge said. ``Without them, we're awfully
young. I think our freshman have done great, but they're
freshmen.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU's Evans said top-ranked Duke has dominated college
basketball this year because the Blue Devils have been able to
``keep their kids longer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have experience, that's what is going to win,''
Evans said. ``When we went to Mississippi, we said we were going to
recruit kids who were not high-profile kids but would keep them
four years. We started three freshmen and two sophomores at
Mississippi. Three of those freshman now are seniors. They won
because they started 100 games. There's nothing they came up
against they hadn't seen.
</P>
<P>
   ```When you're talking about a guy going through a conference
situation three or four years, he knows how to play like a coach.
Football has proven that. They try to redshirt all freshmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida Coach Billy Donovan, who plays Gonzaga tonight, can
relate. He was an assistant at Kentucky when Coach Rick Pitino
signed one of the nation's top recruiting classes there in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our class of Tony Delk, Roderick Rhodes, Walter McCarty was
(rated) top five in the country,'' Donovan said. ``Then, Rick
Pitino says to me, `This class is better than Michigan's Fab 5.' I
said, `What? There's no Juwon Howard or Chris Webber in this
class.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You're right. These kids have to stick together.
They'll be there four years.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was right. Four years later, we won a national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of Gonzaga's players were blue-chip recruits. But they've
meshed as they've stayed together.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not spoiled,'' Evans said. ``They work hard. They
surpass the other guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northern Arizona (a 20-win team for the second consecutive
year) was an example of this. It was an experienced basketball
team, not tremendously talented. They have guys who can shoot the
basketball, guys who can defend. They can't do it all, but they can
do enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons, who was coaching Kansas State when the Suns hired
him the first time in 1970, said he wouldn't enjoy coaching at a
big-time college program today.
</P>
<P>
   ``You recruit a kid now and hope he stays two years,''
Fitzsimmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mighty Blue Devils could be affected by the early
exits.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports that sophomore center Elton Brand will
turn pro after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senior draft in the NBA has been depleted,'' Fitzsimmons
said. ``So if the senior draft has been depleted, the college game
has to be hurt.''

GONZAGA SEEKS A LITTLE RESPECT  
 ZAGS HAVE ODD NAME, GOOD GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In this under-appreciated, over-achieving world of
little guys, where respect is gained with proper enunciations and
knowing your geography, Florida, meet Gonzaga, your West Regional
semifinal opponent tonight.
</P>
<P>
   No, not ``ahg'' but ``aga,'' as in Zag.
</P>
<P>
   As Coach Dan Monson left the podium at America West Arena during
Wednesday's news conference, he again reminded everybody how to
pronounce Gonzaga, which he also did a lot in Seattle in the first
two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse Florida Coach Billy Donovan if his Long Island accent
gets in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from New York, and I still pronounce Florida with an `er'
at the end,'' said Donovan, in his third year as the school's
coach. ``Maybe it's motivation for them, but we've got respect for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the way you say their name has any bearing on
the respect level.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, the Gators (22-8) know all about 10th-seed Gonzaga _
that it's from Spokane, Wash., that it's the smallest school left
in the NCAA Tournament, that it has never gotten this far, that it
has won 27 games, that it has made 38 of 72 three-pointers in its
past three games, that it knocked off No. 2 seed Stanford to get
here, that much of the nation is behind it.
</P>
<P>
   They've gone over film. They see a smart, good-shooting team
that shows heart on the boards and feeds off the crowd's emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we've got a great challenge, going against a very
good basketball team,'' Donovan said. ``We need to focus on trying
to win than, `Wow, why aren't people talking more about us?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Attention comes with advancement, and Florida (22-8), the sixth
seed, which has advanced to the Sweet 16 for the third time in its
history, can't complain about how the tournament has unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators, led by a talented trio of freshmen, have yet to face
a team with a higher seed. They avoided North Carolina in the
second round, thanks to Weber State and Harold Arceneaux. Now, they
get another lower-seeded team in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, you can take seedings and throw them out the
window,'' Donovan said. ``All I think seedings are for is who wears
the light and who wears the dark uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   That will be needed to tell these teams apart. Both average
about 80 points a game. Both teams are 10 deep. Both feed off the
three-point arc. Both love to get up and down the court.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags have made 274 threes, behind Richie Frahm (87 threes),
Matt Santangelo (62) and Quentin Hall (52).
</P>
<P>
   The Gators, led by forward Mike Miller and guard Teddy Dupay,
have averaged 12.5 threes in their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have incredible similarities,'' Monson said. ``Both are
superior shooting teams with tremendous skill players. Both can
step out four guys that can shoot quality threes. We are two of the
more skilled teams as far as being offensively skilled at all five
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   With 6-foot-7, 260-pound freshman Udonis Haslem giving the
Gators an inside presence, and senior guard Eddie Shannon, the
school's career steals leader, Florida will try to use its depth
and athleticism to wear down the Bulldogs with a relentless press
for 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that our depth of playing 10 guys every game will help
us,'' Monson said. ``It's certainly a concern to me, because, in
our league, we've been this invincible team that can't be pressed
with two point guards (Hall and Santangelo) on the floor at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been challenged with full-court pressure much this
year at all. Whether we're good at it or not, we haven't had a lot
of repetitions at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga's a team that feels there should be no ``Cinderella''
tag to its journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like you don't believe and you're kind of lucky to
be here, that it's kind of magical that it's happening,'' Monson
said. ``Our kids don't believe that way.''

MAJERUS HAS STANDARDS TEST WITH A TWIST FOR ALL RECRUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Squatting in the middle of a semi-circle of reporters,
Rick Majerus was dispensing, Buddha-like, his wisdom on college
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the NCAA basketball tournament last week in New
Orleans' Superdome, the Utah coach was holding forth on the
consequences of the end of Proposition 16, the college-sports rule
that precludes freshmen from competing if their SAT or ACT scores
are below minimums.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial rule was struck down last week in Philadelphia
by a federal judge who said that it had ``unjustified disparate
impact'' on African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have long contended that use of standardized tests as
primary filters for athletic participation were racially biased
because the athletes often came from impoverished schools that left
them ill-prepared to handle national tests.
</P>
<P>
   Majerus was citing the example of Andre Miller, his All-America
guard who had to sit out his first year because of a low SAT score,
which prevented some schools from even recruiting him. But since
Utah's rules allow acceptance of a non-qualifier, Miller blossomed
as a student and player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre Miller is a good guy, a good C student who will lead a
happy life and impact those around him,'' said Majerus, taking the
standard poignant coaching theme of hailing kids who are saved by
sports after surmounting what is popularly viewed as NCAA-imposed
roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   Majerus advocated that each school set standards according to
its own ``academic mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that there are a number of schools
whose ``academic mission'' is to get Billy Packer to talk about
them on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   With vague or absent academic minimums _ which is exactly the
case at the moment, pending appeals of the court ruling _ there is
little stopping unscrupulous programs from getting the gnarliest,
thuggiest guys fresh from prison to fetch rebounds and 14th seeds.
</P>
<P>
   If these ``student athletes'' wash out academically after the
tournament, what the heck _ they would have gone to the NBA anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Even the supposedly scrupulous programs, such as the University
of Minnesota, seem to have a hard time with the student part of the
``student athlete'' phrase, unless their mission is to have the
smartest academic support staff money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Majerus what, in the absence of the now-invalidated
standards, he proposed would keep schools from signing up
illiterates, reprobates and other dubious characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the newspapers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers?
</P>
<P>
   Us? Me?
</P>
<P>
   In charge of policing academic standards at Division I jock
factories?
</P>
<P>
   Gee, I can't wait for the chance to tell Bobby Knight that,
according to my standards, he needs to boot two juniors and a
sophomore from his Indiana team. And while I'm in the mood, maybe
I'll wear a meat hat into a tiger cage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the notion of being cop on the admissions beat is
intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``Young man, I'm spotting you the C and the A, and
I want you to give me the third letter that spells a furry
four-legged pet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, how 'bout X?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope. Sorry. Here's your admission forms to Washington State.
If you'd given me a D, M, P, or T _ anything that made a real word
_ you coulda been a Husky.'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   As fair and exacting a standard as that test is, it still
wouldn't be enough. Here are one newspaper's standards that require
the prospective recruit to demonstrate aptitude in multiple
disciplines that would project to successful completion of a
Division I college career:
</P>
<P>
   English: Complete every sentence with at least one of three
fundamental phrases: ``You know,'' ``Know what I'm sayin'?'' and
``It was God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   Health sciences: When the drug test comes back positive, develop
the psychomotor skills to self-induce a case of asthma and forge a
prescription to justify the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Civics: Identify all highway signage at least by color, if not
words.
</P>
<P>
   Geography: When identified as the father, the ability to quickly
produce phone numbers of a doctor and a lawyer in a distant town.
</P>
<P>
   Economics: When shaving points for the frat-boy bookie, master
the distinctions between the fundamental doctrines that govern the
capitalist model: Over-under or win-loss.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematics: Break down a 64-team bracket so that one of the
regions gets a Gonzaga (trick question _ it's an impossibility).
</P>
<P>
   Psychology: Understanding of the dysfunctional patterns implicit
in the coaching behavior signaled by the phrase: ``I have no
intention of leaving this fine institution for another job.''
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, the thoughtful Majerus, instead of lamenting a
potentially disastrous development for college basketball, has come
upon a grand solution: Calling upon the fourth estate to set fair,
practical, common-sense standards, developed at the local level
consistent to the institution's academic mission as well as the
student-athlete's best interests.

COYOTES BEAT THE BUZZER  
 TKACHUK SCORES WINNER WITH :01 REMAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ They started their new goaltender. They skated a new
player they just signed earlier in the day as a free agent. And
they showcased entirely new lines from top to bottom because seven
regulars were out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Why, the Coyotes even were kind enough to wear their new green
uniforms Wednesday night against the Detroit Red Wings, which was
appropriate considering they were playing on St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Not another same old loss, if you can believe it.
</P>
<P>
   The new-look Coyotes looked a lot like their early-season selves
during their fist-pumping, 4-3 victory over the two-time defending
Stanley Cup champions, a win punctuated by Keith Tkachuk's dramatic
game-winning goal with just one second left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   It took a lot of the sting away from the 7-2 disastrous loss
they suffered just two weeks ago against these same Red Wings, who
got star center Sergei Fedorov back from a five-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was huge, just a huge win for the club,'' said Tkachuk,
whose 29th goal was his seventh game-winner of the season, one shy
of his franchise record. ``It was a game where we had control, they
had control, and right before we scored, Mike (goalie Mikhail
Shtalenkov) made some big saves and we came down a catch a break
there and Jeremy makes an unbelievable pass to me.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly beating Shtalenkov in close, Detroit's Vyacheslav
Kozlov, who scored twice earlier, turned the puck over in the
waning seconds. Roenick scooped it up and started a rush with
Tkachuk streaking in on his left on goalie Norm Maracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about taking the shot myself,'' Roenick said, ``but
I had to push it wide and then I saw Keith battling to gain
position and as soon as his stick went on the ice, I zipped it over
and he made a great play by putting it in.''
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 19,983 _ the 100th consecutive
regular-season full house at Joe Louis Arena _ let out a deafening,
collective moan as Maracle tumbled and the puck hit the back of the
net.
</P>
<P>
   ``One second left? Man, that's like a last-second field goal in
the NFL or a last-second shot in the NBA,'' Coyotes forward Rick
Tocchet. ``Very rarely, though, do you see a guy score in the last
second in hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Shtalenkov, getting his first start and first action in goal
since being acquired earlier this month from the Edmonton Oilers,
stopped 28 shots for his first win in nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' he said. ``I wasn't playing for a while, I
was nervous before the game, and it just feels good to get the
first one in the first game. Especially in Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes (33-24-11), who acquired veteran NHL forward Brian
Noonan Wednesday morning, now head into St. Louis for a game
tonight against the Blues with some much-needed momentum. They are
2-0-1 in their past three games after losing 11 of their previous
13.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great play by Jeremy and if you give Tkachuk enough
opportunities, he's going to find the back of the net,'' Coach Jim
Schoenfeld said, noting Tkachuk put a game-high eight shots on
goal. ``But this was a team effort. . . . It's a win in dramatic
fashion, but the most important ingredient for me is how the
players hung in there for each other. They refused to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look promising early. During the first shift of the
game, Coyotes defenseman Teppo Numminen went down in a heap after
getting high sticked in the face. The inadvertent stick drew blood,
but no penalty from referee Dan Marouelli.
</P>
<P>
   Numminen returned and toughed it out, but the Coyotes, playing
Detroit for the last time in the regular season, were slumping
their shoulders soon afterward when Kozlov buried a tic-tac-toe
play set up by Doug Brown and Igor Larionov just 1:38 into the game
for a 1-0 Detroit lead. Shtalenkov never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes tied it when Mike Sullivan screened Maracle on a
Mike Stapleton slap-shot goal and then went up when Bob Corkum fed
Greg Adams for a picturesque deke move. The Red Wings countered,
however, with two goals of their own, a power play score by Niklas
Lidstrom and a four-on-four tally by Kozlov.
</P>
<P>
   After blowing a lengthy two-man advantage late in the second
period, Numminen bailed out the Coyotes with an early third-period
score. Then the Red Wings, playing without suspended forward Kirk
Maltby, had a goal disallowed when captain Steve Yzerman was caught
in the crease on a deflection by Brown.

IFFY GREENS GIVE TOURNEY NEW LOOK

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Competing earlier this week in a pre-tournament event
for the Standard Register PING, defending champion Liselotte
Neumann was attempting a bunker shot almost identical to one she
had a year earlier on the 18th hole in a playoff against Rosie
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have forgotten, the Swede looked like a goner
against Jones in the 1998 tournament but managed a spectacular
blast to within 3 inches of the cup to save par and prolong the
playoff, which Neumann won on the third extra hole.
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, Neumann's sand shot went whizzing by the
cup. Naturally, the circumstances were much different, but Juli
Inkster had a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, this is not the same green that Lotta won the tournament
on last year,'' Inkster said.
</P>
<P>
   She's right. Not only is the 18th green at Moon Valley Country
Club brand, spanking new, so are two others _ the 14th and the
15th, a hole that has been scaled down from a par 4 to a par 3.
</P>
<P>
   Add the other 15 greens at ``the Moon'' into the equation, all
of which are suffering to some degree from poa annua, patchwork and
other problems, this could be a whole new tournament for the next
four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's more of a big hitter's course,'' said Neumann,
meaning this will not be a putting contest. ``You still have to
make the 3- and 4-footers, which is difficult when the greens
aren't great.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from tee to green, the fairways are good. And the rough is
up, which will make hitting the fairways just that more
challenging. It should be a very interesting tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Karrie Webb, an Australian who has been tearing it up this
season with two victories behind an incredible 68.42 scoring
average, agrees that the spotty putting surfaces might put more of
a premium on that portion of the short game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get disheartened out here,'' Webb warned. ``If you
put a good stroke on it and it doesn't go in, that's golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb said accuracy, as well as power, will play a big part in
who wins the $127,500 first prize on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've mowed the greens (down), so you have to be a good
irons player,'' Webb said. ``And the rough is longer, so it's
important to be on the short grass (fairways).''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the greens at Moon Valley are much better than they
were a month ago. Still, there are some areas on the putting
surfaces that would be deemed as ``ground under repair'' if the
blight wasn't on the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pretty bumpy, even the new ones,'' Webb said. ``But I
don't see the winning score being too much different than last year
(13 under). Someone is going to be able to putt on these greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Good point. All of the 144 players who are entered here will
have to roll the ball on the same 18 greens. And with the way the
pros on the LPGA are lighting it up these days, how low can you go
will still be the theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stronger players will be at an advantage,'' said
Inkster, last week's winner in Tucson. ``I think you're going to
have to hit it really good and stay out of the bunkers because the
ball tends to plug, and that's an automatic bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're probably looking at the usual suspects. I can get it
going here, and Karrie and Kelly (Robbins) hit it real long, which
is what you need to play this course. Annika (Sorenstam) is always
up there, and Laura (Davies) always plays well here. But any player
who gets the right bounces has a good shot to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is an authority on Moon Valley, it's Davies, who had
her streak of four straight Standard Register PING titles snapped
last year, when she finished 6 shots back after blowing sky high in
the second round with a 77.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing better than my scores suggest, but putting remains
the problem,'' Davies said. ``I've made every cut this year _ lo
and behold, I even made the cut in Tucson last week. So I could win
on any given weekend, and this course gives me a better chance of
doing that than most because of its length (6,292 yards).''
</P>
<P>
   But win, lose or draw, the substandard greens will not be an
excuse for the big-hitting Brit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny,'' Davies said of the greens, which will
undergo a renovation once the tournament ends, a makeover that will
temporarily send the tournament to a yet-to-be-named course next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard all of these horror stories about them, and they're
really not all that bad. They're a little inconsistent because of
the mix of old and new. But if this was Europe, these would be
great greens.''

GONZAGA'S MONSON HAS SEEN IT ALL AS COACH'S SON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Forgive Dan Monson if he does not demonstrate the
requisite high level of ``gee whiz'' considering where he is right
now.
</P>
<P>
   You might think a second-year head coach who has brought his
talented and determined Gonzaga University team to the Sweet 16 of
the NCAA tournament might be gushing, floating, happy just to be
here in the West Region that appears set to send mighty UConn to
the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   But the poise and the temperament of Gonzaga's coach have been
forged to withstand extreme elements. That's what happens when you
are the son of a coach, the way Dan Monson is.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially what happens when, after 34 years of coaching,
your dad gets fired, the way Don Monson did at the University of
Oregon in 1992, all but ending a coaching life that began in 1958
at Cheney High.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the elder Monson moved to Pasco High, then to
Michigan State as an assistant to Judd Heathcote, then to Idaho for
five years before, finally, in 1983, he landed in Eugene, where Don
Monson got his biggest break, heading up a Pac-10 program.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dream fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Then, nine years after, it was a dream busted.
</P>
<P>
   Don Monson's fracture with Oregon grew more ugly when he sued
the school for all income he would have earned through radio and
shoe endorsements as well as his salary.
</P>
<P>
   He initially won his case, and a jury awarded him nearly
$300,000. However, he lost the case on appeal and ``I was left with
the lawyer's bill,'' Monson recalled Wednesday, talking as he
waited for his son's team to finish practice at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, he finds it difficult talking about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no qualms about the firing. I did not have good years
my last few years. But what sticks in my craw was what happened
with my contract. I had two years left and I felt that should have
been honored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Former Oregon star) Terrell Brandon went to the pros after
his junior year, and during my last season I lost three starters to
stress fractures,'' Monson said, offering reasons why the Ducks
faltered his last season especially.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fallout and the legal struggle over the contract were
so painful, you can still see it on Don Monson's face to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand. Until you walk in that person's
moccasins, you don't know. My son knows that. The anguish and pain
you go through as a family, only those who have been through it
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The son, now 37, carries his father's lessons inside him like
blood.
</P>
<P>
   That might be why Dan Monson has so coolly handled everything
this NCAA tournament has thrown at him. First, there was all that
conjecture that Gonzaga's first-round win over Minnesota was aided
by the suspension of four Gopher players. Monson did not let any of
that throw him or his players out of whack. In fact, Monson came
back with a rock-solid game plan that knocked out second-seeded
Stanford last Saturday at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be my second year as a head coach, but this is about
my 25th year of knowing the ups and downs of the profession,'' Dan
Monson said Wednesday, on the eve of Gonzaga's tournament matchup
against Florida _ one that has the nation crying ``Cinderella'' at
Monson and Gonzaga despite convincing whipping of the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that, yeah, this is a great time, but I have been on
the other side, living through those, too, as the son of a coach,''
Monson said. ``So I think I am more cautious during these good
times. Likewise, I think I will be able to handle the down sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father, who never made it to the NCAA tournament, Dan
Monson is here so quick he is careful to take pleasure in it. He
knows 20 years could go by without another taste like this. There
are no promises.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the father, years ago, tried to warn the son off
from this intense, unsettling, crazy profession of high risk and
reward. Don Monson told his son to find another way to make a
living. He applauded Dan's decision to declare his college major in
math.
</P>
<P>
   That was even well before 1992, when the worst thing that can
happen to a coach happened to Don Monson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. My father very seriously told me not to go into
coaching. He said it's not a good profession to raise a family. He
said financially it can be very difficult. He said you have too
many other avenues you can go down,'' Dan Monson said.
</P>
<P>
   By his sophomore year at the University of Idaho, however, Dan
Monson decided he wanted to be a coach anyway. He told his father.
He said his father hugged him, told him he was happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he just didn't want me to be a coach because his dad
did it,'' Dan Monson said.
</P>
<P>
   After that, though, the father was nothing but helpful.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, while still at Oregon, Don Monson wrote letters to a
few coaching friends around the country. It was Gene Bartow at the
University of Alabama-Birmingham who wrote back, offering Dan
Monson a graduate assistant job. So, in the summer of '86, the
father and son drove from Eugene to Alabama _ although not without
a little gambling junket along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped in Reno and Las Vegas,'' Don Monson said,
remembering the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but we looked at each other and said if we don't get out
of Nevada right now, we're never going to make it to Alabama. After
that, we had about 40 hours of good, quality time,'' Dan Monson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The quality time continues, especially after Dan Monson watched
in pain as his parents left Eugene and moved back to Eastern
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Monson, who served as assistant coach at Gonzaga for nine years
before taking over last season, likes having his parents living in
the same town. Dan lives on the north side of Spokane. His father
and mother live on the south side. Dan and Don hook up for golf and
meals and, yes, basketball talk.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the old coach can't quite resist the urge to break
out the old playbook every once in awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play Florida (a fullcourt-pressure team), and we have not
been pressed all tournament,'' Dan Monson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this week (when the 'Zags were back in Spokane) he stops by
the office the other day and says: `Now, I know you don't want to
see this ...' Then he draws up his favorite press breaker,'' the
younger Monson said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The young coach said the old coach's idea about how to attack
Florida's press is a good one. You bring the Gonzaga point guard to
mid-court and try to get the ball to him there, as opposed to
having the point guard bring the ball from deep in the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we didn't put it in, but it's in the back of my mind,''
the son said. ``If we are getting hammered in the first half, it's
always good to have some other plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the son won't need the father's favorite press-breaker. He
has his own ideas about how to beat Florida, just as he had his own
ideas about what kind of profession he should take up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you what,'' Don Monson said. ``My son has made
many good decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The old coach will be in the stands watching Thursday night. The
young coach will be on his own, but not without knowing how he got
to this place and not without knowing all the pain that comes with
a little glory.

SUNS CAN'T RECOVER FROM POOR START  
 HOME DEBUT SWEET FOR 2 EX-LAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ All Danny Ainge wanted for his 40th birthday
Wednesday was a St. Patrick's Day victory.
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't seem like too much to ask of the Suns, especially
against a Charlotte Hornets club that had won only six games, drove
its coach to resignation, traded its star and had an All-Star out
for the season because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ainge got a gag gift.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns presented their coach with with a first-quarter flop
that led to a 119-111 Charlotte victory and popped Ainge's balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Former Lakers Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell, who were obtained
in a March 10 trade that sent Glen Rice to Los Angeles, had their
own celebration in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Making their home-court debut, Jones scored 29 points, getting
15 from 17 trips to the free-throw line and hounded Phoenix star
Jason Kidd defensively, while Campbell took down a career-high 19
rebounds to go with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys were as focused as I've seen them all year,'' said
Charlotte's interim head coach, Paul Silas, who was on Ainge's
staff during his first season as the Phoenix head coach. ``I didn't
know whether this team could come together as quickly as they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about the potential. We were effective
pushing the ball up the floor. When Elden rebounds the way he did,
it provides some easy baskets on the other end.''
</P>
<P>
   Too often in a disastrous first quarter for the Suns, Campbell
and the Hornets didn't even need to worry about a rebound. The Suns
turned over the ball five times in the first five minutes, leading
to 10 Charlotte points.
</P>
<P>
   The rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Suns find themselves in midseason crisis. They undid
most of what they accomplished in a victory at Milwaukee 24 hours
earlier. They're one game over .500 (12-11) with the 50-game
season's midpoint approaching and still have Atlanta and Houston
ahead Friday and Saturday on their four-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the worst we've played in a long time,'' Ainge said.
``You look at their 119 points and it's easy to say we played bad
defense, but our offense was just as bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a lot of pride in making the fewest turnovers in the
NBA, and just trying to feed the post we turned it over three or
four times at the start of the game. They got some easy baskets,
and that gave them confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as the Suns were in a spectacular first half in
Milwaukee on Tuesday night, they were spectacularly bad in the
first half Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Getting uncontested shots in the half-court and fast-break
opportunities from Phoenix turnovers, Charlotte ran to a 20-point
lead in the opening 10 minutes. Forward Bobby Phills hit three
three-point field goals and scored 13 of his 24 points in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns spent the rest of the game trying to dig out of that
mess. They got within five late in the third quarter, but former
Suns forward Chucky Brown hit a three-point shot at the
third-quarter buzzer, the Suns missed several layups at key moments
and the Hornets closed the deal down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to force things instead of being patient,'' Kidd
said. ``We wanted to exploit some mismatches and we got too
anxious. That led to fast breaks, which led to three-pointers,
which led to their big lead.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Hornets exploited the Suns' inside, just as Phoenix had
exploited a soft Milwaukee interior the night before. With Jones
leading the way, the Hornets attacked the basket and that led to 42
free throw attempts. The Hornets hit 83 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with a 44-29 whipping Charlotte gave the Suns on the
backboards, it meant another defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was an All-Star for the Lakers last season, said he
and Campbell are anxious to turn around the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying as hard as we can to get back to .500,'' he said.
``If we can get to .500, we have a shot (at the playoffs). That's a
playoff team we beat, and if we play defense the way we did against
them, we'll beat a lot of teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell took exception to suggestions that he is unhappy about
the trade, and said he hopes to finish his career with the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play hard and show everyone that I'm happy to be
here,'' he said. ``It seems the perception was that I don't want to
be here. That's totally untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, it was the Suns who didn't want to be in
Charlotte. &QL;

FAMILY HOMEWORK STRESS COMMON ACROSS SPECTRUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Parents who thought their homework headaches ended
when they left school find their children's assignments are causing
them even more grief.
</P>
<P>
   A national study released Wednesday shows half of all parents
surveyed had at least one screaming, crying, yelling fight with
their children in the past year over homework.
</P>
<P>
   And although the vast majority said they're more involved in
their children's schoolwork than were their own parents, they still
feel it isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers polled said they wished parents would take an
active role in their children's education, but cynically believe
that few actually do.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much do you push?'' asked Larry Smuckler, whose 9-year-old
son, Jason, attends Haynes Elementary School in suburban West
Hills, and whose daughter, Jennifer, 12, attends a gifted program
at Gaspar de Portola Middle School in nearby Tarzana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents may push their kids to excel, so they can get into
advanced classes. And then you find the work is overwhelming. We
don't have any time to ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to get a lot more work to bring home than I can
recall, even in my high school career,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,000 teachers and 1,200 parents with children in
kindergarten through 12th grade was conducted by Public Agenda, a
New York-based nonprofit research organization founded in 1975.
According to the report, published on the Public Agenda Web site,
``homework is the vortex where teacher complaints and parental
pressures seem to converge. In the end, teachers don't feel
supported; parents feel obligated and harassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Hanks, 46, a computer teacher at Christopher Columbus
Middle School in suburban Canoga Park, said she battled with her
daughter and son over homework when they were younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to do it, it was too hard,'' said Hanks, of
West Hills. ``I think they just didn't want to put in the work.''
</P>
<P>
   But as her children grew, they took more responsibility for
their school careers. Erin, a 17-year-old senior at Canoga Park
High School, hit the books more regularly, and Derek, now an El
Camino Real High School freshman, started playing soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realized he needed to keep his grades up. Sports were his
motivator,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks said another governor is the fact she keeps in touch with
her children's teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I know what the teachers expect, it's easier for me to have
the same expectations,'' she said. ``Teachers want parents to be
involved. It really makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And the survey numbers bear that out.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers said in the survey that although some parents deserve
the scorn, others struggle to find time to be with their children,
and balk at having it entirely consumed by algebra problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's tremendous pressure with your real sharp college-bound
kids to do a lot of reading and a lot of homework,'' said Philip
Toyotome, assistant principal at Reseda High School.
</P>
<P>
   But he's seen the other end of the spectrum, as well _ the
children who struggle with the most basic assignments, or simply
don't do them. And then there are the parents who don't care enough
to keep on top of their children's progress, or those who care so
much about creating a better life for their children that they have
no time left after work to help with studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times these are parents who work very hard, get home
late at night and simply ask their kids, `Did you finish your
homework?' '' Toyotome said. ``They shouldn't just accept the kid's
word.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some parents who don't follow through. I sympathize
with that, but that's a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it wasn't like that,'' he said. ``I wish parents would
have two hours of quality time to spend with their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a University of Michigan study, average homework
for 9- to 11-year-olds increased from 169 minutes per week to 210
minutes between 1981 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, hard work can only do so much,'' Toyotome said.
Now he counsels parents that colleges no longer want just straight
A's, but prefer a well-rounded student _ one who has participated
in sports and other after-school activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, let's have him study,'' he said, ``but not at the
sacrifice of the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a juggling act can be tough, though. Between band, sports,
an after-school job, a social life and time spent with the family,
students are stretched in many directions _ just as their parents
are, if they try to be active and watchful over their children's
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy task, to do your own thing, and help them
with their thing,'' Smuckler said. ``But the rewards are fairly
significant. Their generation will be better off for it.''

INSTANT REPLAY WILL RETURN  
 NFL OWNERS VOTE 28-3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -Without a rash of bad calls last season, the NFL might
not have voted on Wednesday to reinstate instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood was that we had to do this thing now,'' said Seattle
Seahawks Coach Mike Holmgren, co-chairman of the league's
competition committee.
</P>
<P>
   The owners voted, 28-3, to use replay next season, bringing it
back for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Cardinals, Cincinnati Bengals and the New York Jets
opposed the measure, which creates a challenge system and reverses
calls only when the referee has ``indisputable visual evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren was coach of the Green Bay Packers last season when a
botched call cost him a playoff game. San Francisco wide receiver
Jerry Rice lost a fumble but the play was whistled dead. On the
next play, the 49ers scored the game-winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But with the system the league adopted on Wednesday, the Rice
play would not have been reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The play is over once the whistle is blown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Replay can't fix that, never could,'' NFL spokesman Greg
Aiello said.
</P>
<P>
   Boundary and possession plays can be reviewed. Pass interference
wouldn't be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want the best team to win and rightfully so, even if
it goes against us,'' Buffalo Bills Coach Wade Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was the victim of two bad calls in the final minute of
a 25-21 loss to New England, including a 10-yard catch by the
Patriots' Shawn Jefferson in which TV replays showed he was out of
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills were one of nine teams that voted against replay a
year ago. Seven of those clubs, including the Bills, changed their
vote this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were willing to take a shot for one year,'' said Tampa
Bay Coach Tony Dungy, whose team voted against replay a year ago.
``Now, we had teams that maybe were burned on a call and changed
their votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill remained a staunch opponent of
replay even though he knows fans support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think the game should be left on the field,'' Bidwill
said.
</P>
<P>
   The league adopted a replay plan that is a blend of two systems
used in the past.
</P>
<P>
   For 56 minutes of the game _ all but the last two minutes of
each half _ coaches will be able to challenge calls. Each team will
be allowed two challenges a game.
</P>
<P>
   In the final two minutes of each half, an official in the press
box, a replay assistant who is a recently retired NFL or college
official, will control the challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't to correct every wrong, just the big play, the
obvious play,'' said Tampa Bay General Manager Rich McKay,
co-chairman of the league's competition committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system adopted, the referee on the field will remain
in control at all times. He will view the replay and determine
whether the challenge should be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   If the challenge is not upheld, the team loses a timeout. If the
play is reversed, the team keeps the timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lose the challenge, you should lose a timeout,'' said
Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin, who unlike his owner favors replay.
``If you challenge and don't win, you should be penalized.
Otherwise, (coaches) would be challenging all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Coach George Seifert said he will challenge only the
most ``glaring calls that anyone at home can see'' because of the
timeout risk.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a 90-second limit on challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes more than 90 seconds, the (challenge) probably
doesn't have the evidence it needs,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the technology that would be used hasn't been
determined. A handheld digit recorder is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches likely will make their challenges by pushing a beeper. &QL;

OF SECRETS, SERVICE AND BOTH AT THE WALDORF 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By becoming a murder victim last weekend, a guest at
the Waldorf-Astoria created the ultimate crisis for his hosts. And
if you think Chief Concierge Michael L. Romei is going to talk
about it, it has been a while since you stayed in a nice hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Romei, who wears the gold keys of the prestigious concierge
society, Les Clefs d'Or, on his custom-made suit, does not tell
tales (well, not too many tales) about the guests who spend $295
and up for a room at the Waldorf-Astoria. He is even a bit worried
about revealing which guest most impressed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sophia Loren,'' Romei says. ``It was very busy and she just
walks in and there was dead silence. She just has such a tremendous
presence. I don't know. Should I mention her name?''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the awkward matter of the death of a Brazilian national
named Joao Saboia at the Waldorf. How does one keep the guests from
fear when the body of a man with his throat cut is found in his
room and the prime suspect is nowhere to be found and the police
are traipsing around the premises?
</P>
<P>
   ``We really handle it the same as any other crisis or problem
that would occur in a public building,'' says Romei (pronounced
Ro-MAY). ``We continue to smile and behave as if there wasn't
anything going on. Because one of the things I do believe creates
worry or pandemonium is when the people working are visibly
stressed. I've been in all kind of crisis in the hotel business. ''
</P>
<P>
   Example, please.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a major crisis which closed the city in the winter at
'95. I have these regular guests from Mexico City and they have
their own plane. They called me from the plane and said they had no
place to land, so I'm on the phone with all these control towers,
trying to find them an airport. Philly, no; Atlantic City, no. I
finally got clearance in Albany.''
</P>
<P>
   Aren't pilots supposed to know how to do that for themselves?
</P>
<P>
   The closest to a complaint that will ever escape the
clean-shaven mug of Romei: ``People call me for everything. Not
everybody thinks of calling themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   From time to time as you lurch through life, you will spot a
perfectly-composed person who has never had cat hair on his suit
and never will. Nine times out of 10, this person will be a
concierge.
</P>
<P>
   Romei, though only 40, supervises the 12 concierges at the
Waldorf. His domain is not the main hotel, where the homicide
occurred (Room 2716; the suspect, who had been traveling with the
deceased, is believed to have returned to Brazil, his native
country), but the Waldorf Towers, which has its own entrance and
small lobby, and which is where the president stays when he's in
town. Rates at the Towers make rooms at the main hotel look like a
bargain. A one-bedroom starts at $675; the presidential suite is
$7,500.
</P>
<P>
   What is one to make of a job where Bruce Springsteen strolls by
and a guest literally throws her dry-cleaning at you and a Secret
Sercice guy yells, ``Hey, Michael, anything for the ambassador this
morning?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never give that mail directly,'' Romei whispers. ``It
has to go through the metal detectors in Security. I don't know if
I'm allowed to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Romei seems to consider his work a calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, this is Michael the concierge,'' he sings, no
matter how frantically the phones are ringing. ``How can I be of
service?''
</P>
<P>
   And, of his closetlike cubicle in the Tower's lobby, crammed
with magazines and phone books and a seating chart of the city's
theaters:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is, my empire. This is where I part the waters.''
</P>
<P>
   His style is not aloof. Think Eagle Scout who could get you a
table at Le Cirque and also be able to provide the name of a
plastic surgeon or to speak French to the dog or give you the best
route to Bali. A Scout who can knot an Hermes tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a doctor as far back as I can remember,'' says
Romei, who was raised in New Haven, Conn., the son of a highway
engineer. ``I really enjoyed taking care of people. Which is
similar to what I do. Caretaking. I really believe there is no way
you could stand here all day and do what I do if you didn't do it
from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the sciences and the math, which he found ``kind of
dull,'' that got in the way of Romei's medical plans. Instead, he
studied international politics at Manhattanville College and New
York University, with thoughts of travel and a diplomatic career.
He wound up working for an oil company. Ten years ago, he moved
into hotel work. He knew at once he should be a concierge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy taking a bad situation and turning it around by
making a person feel special or comforted,'' says Romei, who lives
on Sutton Place. ``If I know they like hot chocolate or a special
newspaper I have it sent to their room. If they call me lost from
the street, I send a car. We have our own car service, our own
chauffeur, at the Waldorf Towers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other requests made to Romei include providing a Saudi prince
with fresh dates (the fruit) out of season and obtaining wholesale
bakery equipment for a guest who wanted to open a cafe in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted special racks and special curtain rods for the cafe
and all the equipment shipped to Ethiopia,'' Romei says.
</P>
<P>
   Did she tip?
</P>
<P>
   Only the slightest hint of a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, she didn't.''

BOBBY AYALA SHINES IN WIN FOR MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Bobby Ayala threw a 1-2-3 ninth inning to close
out the Mariners' 7-2 win over the Oakland Athletics on Wednesday.
So what else is new?
</P>
<P>
   Ayala is getting used to pitching effectively this spring. In
six innings over five games, he has a 1.50 earned-run average. He
has eight strikeouts and one walk. And he's basically a smiling
machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really feeling strong,'' he said. ``I'm having a great
spring so far, and I'm happy about it. Things couldn't be going any
better than they are right now. I feel great about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, 1-10 last year with a 7.29 ERA, still could be traded,
and he said he'll be happy wherever he is. But if this Ayala is the
one the Mariners bring north, they just might want to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitching with a lot of confidence right now,'' said
pitching coach Stan Williams. ``He had stretches like this last
year where he knocked your eyes out. ... He's got a split-finger
that's almost unhittable, his change-up's as good as anyone's on
the ballclub, we have him at 94 (mph) on the gun down here and he's
got a good slider to boot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala said it usually takes him a month into the season to throw
94 mph, which could explain why he struggles in April (career ERA:
5.66). But this winter, he threw more than ever in an effort to
start the year right, and he's seeing the results already.
</P>
<P>
   He's also trying to work more change-ups into his repertoire.
Ayala threw the pitch twice Wednesday, once inducing a ground out,
and said it's an ideal pitch for getting ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala rarely used the change-up last year, but he's trying to
bring it back so it can help his split-finger. The splitter comes
in at 87-88 mph, four to five mph faster than the change-up, but
has a much harder break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling comfortable throwing it a lot more now,'' Ayala
said. ``Maybe it'll knock hitters off-balance a little bit. It's
going to confuse them seeing something (breaking) soft off-speed
and then something (breaking) hard off-speed.''
</P>
<P>
   LEITER'S SIDE: In the Mariners' other game Wednesday, a 3-2 win
over the A's in Phoenix, Russ Davis homered twice and Jamie Moyer,
Mark Leiter and Jose Paniagua all pitched effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter has worked 10 innings this spring, allowing three earned
runs. A reliever with the Phillies last year, he is being
considered for a starting job in Seattle but could work from the
bullpen. Leiter said he enjoys the set-up relief role, but his
preference is to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this offense, being a starter would be a lot of fun,
because they're going to score runs,'' said Leiter, who turns 36
next month. ``If you condition yourself and keep your stamina
going, then you can pitch 200-plus innings and you're going to get
a lot of decisions. I can't see how you wouldn't want to be in this
rotation. I mean, you would think you'd have a chance to win 15
games.''
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: Right-hander Freddy Garcia continues to
impress. He pitched three scoreless innings in Peoria, striking out
four and allowing one hit. The Mariners would prefer more seasoning
for the 22-year-old Garcia, who had never pitched above Class A
before '98, but he could change their minds with more performances
like Wednesday's. ... Ken Griffey Jr. had a homer and five runs
batted in at Peoria. ... Non-roster outfielder Earl Johnson, who
manager Lou Piniella said is the quickest player in camp, hit an
inside-the-park home run in the Phoenix game. ... The latest
Mariner to be sidelined with a sore neck is Edgar Martinez, who sat
out Wednesday's split-squad action. ... Two things have impressed
Piniella most this spring: His pitchers have 40 more strikeouts
than walks, and his fielders have made only nine errors in 14
games. In fact, the Mariners were the last major league team to
allow an unearned run this spring, doing so for the first time on
Tuesday.

DUCATI POWER PAYS AT PIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - What is it about Phoenix International Raceway that
bonds Doug Polen, Troy Corser, Mat Mladin and Anthony Gobert?
</P>
<P>
   Ducati.
</P>
<P>
   In four previous AMA Cruise America Arizona Superbike Challenges
at PIR, Ducati has been the two-wheeled monster to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gobert, who made his superbike debut last year at PIR, had
no trouble reaching victory lane. He won by a lengthy 8{ seconds,
smacking defending champion Mladin, who was runner-up on a Suzuki.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (Suzuki) feel we can stop the (Ducati) streak this year,
but the Ducati is a good bike for this layout,'' said Mladin, who
won two years ago on a Ducati. ``That 1000cc motor puts a lot of
power down to the ground and that's what you need at Phoenix
because the track is very tight and twisting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can make that kind of power and acceleration off the
corners, that can make all the difference (at PIR).''
</P>
<P>
   Although not viewed as one of the circuit's more technically
innovative racetracks, PIR's 11-turn, 1.51-mile road course, which
encompasses much of the 1-mile oval, still can cause headaches and
sleepless nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say Ducati doesn't make as much power as some of the
other bikes, but the power it does make is very usable at lower
RPMs,'' said three-time superbike champion Doug Chandler, who will
tackle PIR on a Kawasaki. ``It has a lot of torque, which allows it
to get off the tighter corners better.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the usage of PIR's oval, there are enough infield
turns to apparently benefit the Ducati contingent.
</P>
<P>
   But Vance &AMP; Hines Ducati Team Manager Jim Leonard believes
Ducati's advantage may be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the rest of the field step it up last year,'' Leonard
said. ``I don't think by any means we have a huge advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, however, does admit the Ducati machine seems best
suited for PIR-type courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracks that have real slower corners, like that bus stop (Turn
9, the final corner leading onto PIR's dogleg along the
back-straightaway) tend to favor the Ducati because it tends to
drive off those corners very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rider on a Ducati has always got the power when he needs it.
Whenever he moves the throttle, he doesn't have to wait on it like
a lot of riders on Japanese bikes.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be good for Ducati's top riders, which includes
defending series champion Ben Bostrom, who finished fourth two
weeks ago in the season-opening Daytona 200 at Daytona
International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   But what does it mean for non-Ducati riders such as Daytona 200
champion Miguel Duhamel, who won on a Honda?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? All Duhamel knows is he has other worries.
</P>
<P>
   Although he won at Daytona, Duhamel said PIR's layout presents
larger problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daytona is a long course and you have time to set up for the
corners,'' Duhamel said. ``Phoenix is left-right, left-right,
boom-boom-boom. I can't use my left leg that much and that's not
good at a place like Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not expecting to come out of there with flying colors. If
I crack the top five, I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Duhamel, however, wouldn't be surprised to see Harley-Davidson
riders Scott Russell and Pascal Picotte do well.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harley-Davidson has yet to reach the winner's circle
since returning to the circuit five years ago, Duhamel believes the
motorcycle has similar traits as the Ducati.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pascal and I get along well and he tells me the bike is
good,'' Duhamel said.
</P>
<P>
   Picotte crashed at Daytona, however, and finished far back.
</P>
<P>
   Russell didn't even make the show. He suffered two facial
fractures in an off-track incident at a Daytona Beach nightclub and
was forced to scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Russell underwent surgery last Thursday and a Harley-Davidson
team spokesperson said the rider will be at PIR. &QL;

SEAHAWKS' QUARTERBACK SEARCH TURNS TO JETS' FOLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ The Seahawks' search for a veteran quarterback
has led them to former New York Jets starter Glenn Foley.
</P>
<P>
   There have been talks between the clubs about the possibility of
a trade for Foley, 28, who has one year remaining on his contract
but is expendable because of the re-emergence of Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Foley would give the Seahawks the young veteran quarterback new
coach and general manager Mike Holmgren wants to backup and perhaps
challenge Jon Kitna for the starting job. The Jets would receive a
middle-round draft choice that could increase in value depending on
how much Foley plays.
</P>
<P>
   Each team, however, is exploring other options.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bears also are interested in Foley, although he
favors being traded to the Seahawks. The Seahawks consider Foley
just the latest alternative in their quarterback quest and also
would be interested in Jeff Blake if the Cincinnati Bengals decide
to release him or make him available in a trade. The Seahawks
already have courted but lost Doug Pederson (signed with
Philadelphia), Gus Frerotte (signed with Detroit), Stoney Case
(signed with Indianapolis) and Jim Harbaugh (traded to San Diego
this week).
</P>
<P>
   Two things are certain: Holmgren is determined to acquire a
young veteran, preferably before the start of the Seahawks'
four-day quarterback camp March 29; and Jets coach Bill Parcells is
even more determined to unload Foley before the team's offseason
conditioning program begins next week.
</P>
<P>
   Foley is scheduled to start receiving a $400,000 workout bonus,
at $10,000 per workout, next Wednesday. Plus, he will count more
than $2 million against the salary cap this year in base salary and
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, a seventh-round draft choice in 1994, was effective in
brief stints as the starter in 1996 and 1997. He opened 1998 as the
starter, but quickly played his way into Parcells' doghouse. First,
Foley hid an injury from Parcells in the second half of a Week 2
loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Then, Foley played poorly in a Week 5
loss to St. Louis, prompting Parcells' decision to go with
Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde led the Jets to 10 wins in their final 11
regular-season games and into the AFC championship game. He was
rewarded last month with a three-year, $19.5 million contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   Foley completed 58 of 108 passes for 749 yards with four
touchdowns and six interceptions before being replaced. He has
never thrown more than 110 passes in a season.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: James Logan has agreed to a two-year, $1.2 million
contract and should re-sign with the Seahawks in the next day or
two. Logan missed the final 12 games in 1998 after breaking his
leg. But he is an outstanding special-teams player and burgeoning
linebacker who had drawn interest from the Philadelphia Eagles.
Logan will be the third unrestricted free agent to re-sign with the
Seahawks, joining TE Christian Fauria and K Todd Peterson. ... The
Seahawks also have added QB Mike McCoy, a former practice-squad
player for the Green Bay Packers who will provide an extra arm for
the upcoming quarterback camp.

KLEINE CONTACTED ABOUT JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suns center  &UR; Joe Kleine said Tuesday he has been contacted by
Arkansas-Little Rock about the school's vacant Division I
basketball coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   Kleine, who played collegiately in nearby Fayetteville for
Arkansas, confirmed Arkansas-Little Rock Athletic Director  &UR; Rick
Mello has contacted him to determine whether Kleine has interest in
the job. It opened earlier this month when  &UR; Wimp Sanderson
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   And Kleine is giving it consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the process of talking about it,'' Kleine said. ``I
don't know where it's going to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleine, a veteran of 14 NBA seasons, said he hasn't decided yet
whether he wants to continue his playing career beyond this season.
He signed a one-year contract with the Suns for $1 million, the
minimum a veteran of 10 seasons or more can receive.
</P>
<P>
   If Arkansas-Little Rock were to offer Kleine the job, and if he
were to accept it, he would complete the season with the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans play in the Sun Belt Conference and finished 12-15
last season. Reportedly,  &UR; Scott Edgar, a former Arkansas assistant
and former Duquesne head coach, also is a candidate. &QL; 
In reserve &QL; 
Guard  &UR; Rex Chapman rarely has come off the bench during his playing
career and said he doesn't remember being very good at it. But
Chapman said he's willing to accept that role.
</P>
<P>
   He came off the bench Tuesday night against the Milwaukee Bucks
for the second game in a row behind rookie  &UR; Toby Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do whatever we can do to win some ballgames,''
Chapman said. ``I'm willing to try anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done it in so long, but you just try to get used to
it. You try to find the flow of the game sitting over there and be
ready when it's your turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman played 27 minutes in reserve Tuesday night, hitting 5 of
10 shots, including three of his four three-point attempts, and
scoring 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, against the Hornets, Chapman compiled a season-high
25 points on eight-of-18 shooting and was three of seven from
three-point range. &QL; 
They said it &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter Tuesday, a fan asked referee  &UR; Dick Bavetta
to count a basket that had been waved off for the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you a first-class upgrade,'' the fan yelled, in
reference to the scandal that saw several veteran NBA officials
dismissed, and later reinstated, because they didn't claim income
from airline ticket exchanges on their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Showing a sense of humor, Bavetta, who wasn't among the referees
implicated, wheeled to the scorer's table and said, ``Let's score
those two points.'' &QL; 
No surprise &QL; 
Suns forward  &UR; Tom Gugliotta wasn't surprised when the Minnesota
Timberwolves traded  &UR; Stephon Marbury because the club wasn't going
to be able to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that might happen,'' said Gugliotta, who has denied
assertions that he and Marbury did not get along. ``I never had a
problem with Stephon. He created a lot of the offense I got there.
He talked a lot about going to a big market where there are more
opportunities for endorsements.'' &QL;

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ If former Suns star Kevin Johnson wants a job,
Charlotte Hornets Coach Paul Silas says he's got one for him.
</P>
<P>
   Silas, who is serving as interim coach here, said Wednesday
before the Hornets and Suns met at Charlotte Coliseum that he plans
to call KJ as early as today and attempt to persuade the veteran
point guard to sign with Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob (Bass, Hornets executive vice president, basketball
operations) called him already,'' Silas said. ``I'm going to call
him and see if he wants to do anything this year.''
</P>
<P>
   KJ could not be reached for comment, nor could his
representative, Kevin Hiestand, but Hiestand has let clubs know
that KJ wants to play an integral role, play for a championship
contender and have the ball in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Told indications are that KJ is likely to seek a two-year
commitment, Silas said, `I don't get involved in that stuff. I'd
just like to see what his interest level is. Then I'd go to Bob and
see what happens. We need a point guard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets currently have David Wesley and Eldridge Recasner at
the position, and they added Corey Beck to a 10-day contract
Wednesday. KJ would be the starter.
</P>
<P>
   But would the Hornets be a contender? They came into Wednesday
night's game with a 6-14 record, but with the additions of guard
Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell, along with forward Derrick
Coleman, the Hornets could put a pretty solid starting five on the
floor.

11-YEAR VETERAN FORWARD SIGNED AS FREE AGENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Coyotes picked up another player before next
week's trading deadline, but they didn't have to trade anything to
get him.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing  &UR; Brian Noonan, an 11-year NHL veteran who has played
all of this season with the minor league Indianapolis Ice, was
acquired Wednesday as a free agent. The 33-year-old Noonan, who
played on the New York Rangers' Stanley Cup championship team in
1994 and spent last season with Vancouver, joined the Coyotes in
time for their 4-3 victory Wednesday over the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   The deal fell together fairly quickly, Noonan said. He got a
call Tuesday night from his agent, Boston-based  &UR; Bob Murray, who
also represents Coyotes captain  &UR; Keith Tkachuk, and in the morning,
he found himself skating at Joe Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it was going to happen,'' said Noonan, who had
19 goals and 44 assists for Indianapolis this season. ``I was
having fun playing hockey down there, but I was still hoping to get
back. This is a good opportunity. I wasn't hearing much, but things
happen in a hurry. Last night I got a call, they said they had some
injuries here and needed some players, and here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Noonan, the 10th overall pick in the 1983 draft by Chicago, was
always one of former NHL Coach  &UR; Mike Keenan's favorite players. He
played for Keenan in Chicago, New York, St. Louis and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first couple years with him, it was tough. He's pretty
demanding, and sometimes you don't know what his reasons for doing
things was, but as I got older and the more time I spent with him,
I enjoyed it,'' said Noonan, who had 19 shifts in his Phoenix
debut. ``I was fortunate that he took me to a lot of places he
went. I learned a lot from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit forward  &UR; Joey Kocur was a teammate of Noonan's in New
York and said he will help the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bit like a  &UR; Ray Sheppard, he's got real good hands
around the net,'' Kocur said. ``He's shifty with a long reach, not
overly fast, but great with the puck _ a smart, reliable forward
who can play in any situation at any time.'' &QL; 
Roenick rumors &QL; 
Every year at about this time, it seems like  &UR; Jeremy Roenick's name
surfaces regarding trade rumors. ``Like clockwork,'' he likes to
say.
</P>
<P>
   The latest one making the rounds courtesy of ESPN's  &UR; Al Morganti
has the Coyotes trading Roenick, possibly after this season, to
pare the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't believe it,'' said Roenick, who has two more years left
on a contract that pays him an average of $4 million per season.
``I'm not going anywhere.'' &QL; 
The mighty Quint &QL; 
Defenseman  &UR; Deron Quint played a game-high and career-high 28
minutes, 22 seconds, and was credited with blocking a total of
seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dead right now,'' Quint sighed. &QL;

EL NINO GIVES, LA NINA TAKES  
 BEAR CUBS FACE DEATH IN DROUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1996, the second-largest wildfire in Arizona
history destroyed 60 square miles of vegetation near Four Peaks in
Tonto National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The Lone Wildfire didn't destroy everything. It missed six
square miles in various green islands, which saved a number of
animals by offering protection and food.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after the fire, ``We found out we didn't have any black
bears,'' said Stan Cunningham, a research biologist for the Arizona
Game and Fish Department. ``Even bears in the green islands were
gone. What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Because of their mobility as compared with smaller mammals,
bears and foxes escaped the fire for the most part. They just left.
But bears are creatures of habit and soon returned, even if just to
pass through.
</P>
<P>
   After three years, it became evident that the bears were coming
back in great numbers. A normal bear count would be about 1.3 per
square mile. The count in the burned area is 7.3 bears per square
mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the highest concentration in the U.S., except for
Alaska when they're eating salmon,'' said Cunningham. ``There are
10 to 12 per square mile there. Where there's food available,
you'll find bears.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, after two consecutive wet years, La Nina has
created the driest year on record. Wildlife once again faces severe
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham was developing a research project on coyotes and
bobcats in the Four Peaks area when the fire struck.
</P>
<P>
   The agency responded by changing courses to see the fire's
effect on predators. It received funds from one federal and one
state source, and Cunningham started the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small mammals,'' Cunningham said, ``were hurt by the fire, but
they already were in bad shape because of drought.''
</P>
<P>
   Bears barely suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their great mobility and adaptabily, bears and gray
foxes fared well and returned to the burned out area. Bobcats
didn't. They will eat only meat, and there wasn't much of that
around. Bears and foxes have a wider range of possible food,
including vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the food shortage, males will come after cubs to eat
them,`` Cunningham said. ``Females may come after each other.
Finally we'll see a reduction of adult populations.''
</P>
<P>
   Few cubs survive the early months, and with food decreasing,
it'll be worse this year. Most will be eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Trapping is banned on public land in this state except for
research reasons. Cunningham prefers to use cable leg snares to
catch and study the animals. The only bear hurt was a trapped one
killed by another bear.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Cunningham and his assistant, Raul Vega, led
reporters to a den in the burned area. The female had been equipped
with a radio collar so she could be traced.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham and Vega used radio telemetry equipment to find her
den under a boulder field. Now the tough part began.
</P>
<P>
   Most people believe that hibernating bears sleep all winter. In
fact, they don't. They'll get up and move around.
</P>
<P>
   When Cunningham crawled to mouth of the den, the female was
sitting and looking at him while her two cubs suckled. Although he
has been victim of a mock attack, he's never been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Vega loaded a large syringe with a combination of a muscle
relaxer and a tranquilizer, and Cunningham attached the syringe to
the tip of a metal rod.
</P>
<P>
   Then he crawled into the den and jabbed the mother with the
syringe.
</P>
<P>
   In time she was down, and Cunningham brought out the two cubs _
a male and female, each weighing nearly four pounds. They were born
in late January. Cunningham examined and weighed the cubs and
pronounced them healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The cubs were hilarious. When Cunningham would peer into the
den, the cubs would chatter like crazy. When outside and being held
by humans, they'd start crying.
</P>
<P>
   Vega soon reported that the mother was becoming more alert. The
cubs quickly were returned to the den.
</P>
<P>
   It's sad to think that neither cub probably will survive the
summer. &QL;

CUP DRIVERS HAVE SOLID REASONS TO RUN BGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Mike Skinner's victory in Saturday's NASCAR Busch Grand
National Series race has been reinstated, get ready for an official
crisis ``du jour''.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner's off-again, on-again victory in the Yellow Freight 300
at Atlanta Motor Speedway means that NASCAR Winston Cup regulars
have won three of the first four BGN races of 1999. Recall that
Skinner's first career BGN victory was deleted by NASCAR officials
following a post-race inspection, which uncovered a non-approved
cylinder head.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner was dropped to the 43rd and last position. But
team-owner David Ridling filed an appeal, and the National Stock
Car Racing Commission modified the penalty against crew chief C.R.
Miller yesterday. The commission upheld the monetary portion of the
penalty but awarded Skinner the victory and first-place points.
</P>
<P>
   Good for Skinner, the Winston Cup points-leader who never turned
a nut or bolt on the Busch engine in question.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the intrusion of Cup drivers into the BGN series
already had become a hot media topic. It has been based upon the
inference that Winston Cup regulars are boldly stealing headlines,
purse money and valuable championship points from their aspiring
Busch brethren.
</P>
<P>
   The debate easily could re-ignite when the tour visits Texas
Motor Speedway for the Coca-Cola 300 on March 27. Approximately 22
Cup regulars are expected to make qualifying attempts for the Busch
race in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there are more Cup drivers ``dropping down'' into
Busch races in 1999 is a noteworthy trend, albeit one faced
regularly since the series' inception in 1982. A variety of
factors, however, apparently are accelerating the process.
</P>
<P>
   Start with money. As part of a four-year extension with title
sponsor Anheuser-Busch, the points fund for top drivers at season's
end has increased to $1.5 million, more than doubling the $650,000
total from 1998. Point-fund awards are paid to the top-20 finishers
in the final BGN standings, although not one Cup regular was in the
final 1998 top-20.
</P>
<P>
   So, what are other reasons for a Cup driver to run Busch?
</P>
<P>
   Some are using the series to test their prowess as team owners
and their marketability. Their name recognition in Winston Cup
surely has allowed drivers like Dale Jarrett, Jimmy Spencer,
Michael Waltrip and Terry Labonte to field BGN teams and attract
the sponsorship to keep them up and running.
</P>
<P>
   From a purely selfish standpoint, running a Busch race at TMS,
for instance, makes sense. The track has been reconfigured and
repaved since last year's Busch and Cup events.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Busch cars are lighter and less powerful than their
Cup counterparts, an extra 200 laps around TMS in a Busch car on
Saturday should help an astute Cup driver learn something he can
tell his crew chief about chassis setups, how the track changes
during a race and if two grooves might be developing for the
Primestar 500 the next afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And if a Cup driver happens to win the Busch race in Fort Worth,
so what?
</P>
<P>
   As long as his cylinder heads are NASCAR-approved, it will be a
trend. Not a crisis, for sure.
SPOTLIGHT ON: KENNY BERNSTEIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Bernstein has flown down quarter-mile drag strips and
flown off the deck of an aircraft carrier over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Louie the Lizard climbed aboard, Bernstein fashioned
a sponsorship relationship with Budweiser that has endured as the
second-longest in professional motorsports. Only NASCAR's Richard
Petty and STP have a longer track record than Bernstein as Bud
King. That pairing, however, nearly did not come together for the
1980 National Hot Rod Association season.
</P>
<P>
   The management at Anheuser-Busch was wavering when Bernstein
asked for, and received, permission for one final five-minute
presentation at the brewery headquarters in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I planned on taking the truck and trailer and race car to St.
Louis and putting it on display, even though we didn't know what
that really meant back then,'' said Bernstein, who was campaigning
a Plymouth Arrow Funny Car. ``I felt I had nothing to lose. I
wanted them to see the size of the 18-wheel tractor trailer, the
beauty of the race car, and where their signage could go.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's meeting was scheduled for Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the brewery at 6 a.m., and set up in front of the
office building,'' Bernstein said. ``We set up in a dirt parking
lot. But everyone had to park there and walk past the display to
get to the office. At 8 o'clock, they started coming to work, and
it created quite a stir.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein scooted up to the fourth floor and returned with Bud's
marketing boys in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent an hour showing them everything,'' Bernstein said.
``At that point, the whole thought process changed. We were able to
secure the program, and to this day I believe that's what saved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein forever stamped himself as the ``King of Speed'' when
he became the first driver to break the 300 mph barrier at 301.70
mph on March 20, 1992, at Gainesville (Fla.) Raceway. The series
returns there this weekend for the Mac Tools Gatornationals, with
Bernstein's places in racing and marketing history secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was truly the first breakthrough of that caliber, Bud
joining the drag racing side of things,'' Bernstein said. ``I like
to think that opened a lot of doors and helped the whole sport.''
QUICK HITS
GORDON LOVES NY
</P>
<P>
   Three-time and reigning NASCAR Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon
says he is excited about the prospect of a NASCAR-style
superspeedway planned for the metropolitan New York City area.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate magnate Donald Trump and NASCAR president Bill
France Jr., in his role as chairman of the board of International
Speedway Corp., announced last week they have begun looking for a
site for a 75,000-seat superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the political part. The current schedule contains 34
race dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest question is who's going to lose a date?'' said
Gordon, driver of the No. 24 DuPont Chevrolet fielded by Hendrick
Motorsports. ``I do not want to see another race added. It's not so
much for me. It's more for the team. These guys are running with
their tongues hanging out right now. They can't afford to run
another race. I think it's ridiculous to say, `Oh, we'll just add
another race, no problem. You just add some more personnel.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anybody to lose a date, but I think that's the
only way we should be going to another venue. And we should be
going to New York, for sure.'' ANDRETTI FIRED UP
</P>
<P>
   Michael Andretti will attempt to become the first CART driver to
win three consecutive season-openers Sunday, with the running of
the Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami at Homestead, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti's Swift/Ford will be shod with Firestone tires for the
first time since Newman/Haas Racing ended its association with
Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   Only Michael's father, Mario Andretti (1984-85 and 1987-88),
Fort Worth's Johnny Rutherford (1980-81) and Rick Mears (1989-90)
have won back-to-back Championship Auto Racing Teams season
openers. `DRIVE' WITH THE DRIVERS
</P>
<P>
   Primestar 500 race-week activities are scheduled to kick off
with the ``Star-Telegram'' Speedway Children Charities Golf
Tournament on Wednesday at Tour 18. The course is 15 minutes from
Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch with Jeff Burton, winner of the first Cup race at TMS,
will open the day, followed by a shotgun start at 1 p.m. NASCAR
Winston Cup and Busch Grand National Series drivers scheduled to
tee off include native Texan Bobby Hillin, Randy LaJoie, Todd
Bodine, Adam Petty, Blaise Alexander, Boris Said and Tim Fedewa.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of four can enter for $1,000, and individuals may play for
$200 each. For information, contact Alicia Jenkins at (817)
215-8564. LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Mike he's the only person in the world who could be
sitting in the first row of church and still get into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Larry McReynolds, to Mike Skinner before NASCAR reinstated his
Busch Grand National victory. nn

HOBBLED STARS FALL TO CAPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There were no four-leaf clovers to be found for the
Stars last night, so maybe it was appropriate that they lost their
13th game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was also appropriate that they lost for the first time
in overtime this season and for only the second time in the past
two seasons. Maybe it was appropriate that all-time Stars franchise
goal-scoring leader Brian Bellows (342 goals with the Minnesota
North Stars) was the guy who flicked home the winner in OT _ with a
broken stick, at that _ and propelled the struggling Washington
Capitals to a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, it was just time for the Stars to lose. Missing three of
their top five scorers and six regulars overall, the Stars were a
mishmash of depth players, a couple who were called up from the
minors the night before. The only thing was, they were playing a
Capitals team that also was thin on depth, missing nine players to
injuries, including leading scorer Peter Bondra (hand),
third-leading scorer Joe Juneau (concussion) and top defensemen
Mark Tinordi (ankle), Sergei Gonchar (ankle) and Calle Johansson
(knee).
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some players out, they had some players out, it's the
guys you replace them with,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We
had some poor players today. Some of our forwards weren't very
good, not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars fell to 42-13-12 and have suffered eight of their
losses to teams with records below .500. The Capitals move to
28-34-6, good for 62 points. They still are eight points behind the
Boston Bruins for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a desperate team, and we didn't match their
energy,'' said winger Mike Keane, one of the Stars players who had
a solid night. ``The injuries are no excuses. We just have to play
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was a mucker's paradise, as many of the players were
seeing rare NHL ice. Stars defenseman Brad Lukowich was playing his
first NHL game of the season and the fifth of his career. He had an
assist, the second of his career, and played 18 minutes. Winger
Blake Sloan continued to provide energy in his fourth NHL game.
Center Kelly Fairchild played in his 24th NHL game, but his first
since 1997. He had more than 12 minutes of ice time.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Wright, on the other hand, was given less than two minutes
of ice time and continued to struggle in his bid to impress Stars
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   While the Stars were trying to fill their holes with rookies,
the Capitals answered with veteran role players. And while the
Stars showed strong energy, especially in the second period when
they took a 1-0 lead on a fluky goal by Tony Hrkac, they were
outhustled and outmuscled in the third period. Andre Nikolishin,
who went 21-5 in the faceoff circle with Stars expert drawmen Joe
Nieuwendyk and Guy Carbonneau out of the lineup, won three
consecutive faceoffs in the offensive zone and finally cashed in on
the third.
</P>
<P>
   The last win helped set up a Nikolishin slap shot from the right
circle that found its way through a maze of bodies and past Stars
goalie Ed Belfour to tie the game, 1-1, with 12:08 remaining in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Washington then won it in overtime, when Adam Oates carried the
puck behind the Stars' net and tried a wraparound shot. The puck
squirted under Belfour and onto the stick of Bellows, who was
standing just to the left of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Just 35 seconds into the Stars' third consecutive overtime game,
they were finally worn down. On a three-game Eastern road swing,
the Stars allowed just five goals and still went 0-1-2.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe they need to get back home and get injured leaders like
Nieuwendyk, Carbonneau, Brett Hull, Darryl Sydor and Richard
Matvichuk into the lineup for tomorrow's home game with the Eastern
Conference-leading Ottawa Senators if they're hoping for a change
of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I'm looking at it,'' said Nieuwendyk, who
missed the game with a sore back. ``This is a good time to come
back.''

DUCKS TAKE NY TRIP FROM FROGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The season hadn't been finished for more
than an hour when TCU coach Billy Tubbs was asked what his thoughts
were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It ended in the same annoying and frustrating fashion that
defined it, a 77-68 loss to Oregon last night in the third round of
the National Invitation Tournament at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum in a
game the Horned Frogs could have won.
</P>
<P>
   It ended despite the best efforts of Horned Frogs preseason
All-American Lee Nailon.
</P>
<P>
   He almost single-handedly sent TCU (21-11) to New York, scoring
a game-high 27 points. He instead sent himself to an NBA draft camp
in two weeks, with his attention likely to remain on that pursuit.
He became the first player in TCU history to have consecutive
700-point seasons, finishing with 1,503 in his two seasons at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   His second season ended because of sloppy play (17 turnovers)
and sporadic shooting (38 percent shooting), and allowed Oregon to
walk away with a victory and the subsequent trip to the NIT
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just came out tonight in the second half and kind of let up
like we thought they were going to give us the game,'' Nailon said.
``Before we knew it, they were knocking down shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was the Frogs' to win, the victory was in their hands.
They just couldn't make a shot.
</P>
<P>
   They scored a season-low 28 points in the second half. They shot
a season-low 31 percent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed a lot of easy shots in the second half,'' Tubbs
said. ``It's hard to look good when your shots aren't going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs downplayed the fatigue factor in the Frogs' shooting
struggles, but the Ducks (19-11) engaged them in a game of keepaway
all evening. They played keepaway along the perimeter, forcing the
Frogs to frantically give chase. The Frogs, utilizing a six-man
rotation and a matchup zone, eventually wore down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting tired a little bit,'' Horned Frogs guard Prince
Fowler said. ``I just kept trying the best I could.''
</P>
<P>
   The too-tired Frogs were unable to nail their shots on one end
while the Ducks finally started hitting theirs on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon shot a luke warm 40 percent for the game, but were
6-of-12 on 3-pointers in the second half after hitting 3-of-13 in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our outside shooting was the difference,'' Ducks
coach Ernie Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   TCU had a 63-61 lead with 5:22 remaining. Oregon proceeded to
get a 3-pointer from A.D. Smith 14 seconds later. He led Oregon
with 18 points. Back-to-back 3-pointers from Darius Wright followed
with 3:37 and 3:02 remaining for a 70-63 Ducks' lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs never recovered _ unable to answer at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   TCU (21-11) already had spotted Oregon plenty of four-point
leads in the second half and already had spent a great deal of time
and energy scratching their way back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our depth has been there all year for us down the stretch and
particularly in the postseason when guys are tired,'' Kent said.
``Playing in the Pac-10 was a struggle, it's a grueling marathon.
What saved us tonight was our depth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what saved the Ducks was the Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the Oregon game ended a lot like the second
half of the season, frustratingly close and yet annoyingly not
close enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to wait by the phone. I'm sure there is another
tournament out there,'' Tubbs said. ``I'll wait by the phone until
one o'clock. If nothing comes up, then the season is over.''

SOSA'S 2 BOWS IRK STOTTLEMYRE  
 CEREMONY UPSETS D-BACKS PITCHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, ARIZ. - Wednesday was St. Patrick's Day, but Diamondbacks
right-hander Todd Stottlemyre certainly wasn't about to say ``Top
o' the afternoon to ya, laddie,'' to Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   He had a few other words in mind for the 1998 National League
MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre's cabbage was steamed after Sosa hit two home runs
off him in front of a sellout crowd of 12,658 at HoHoKam Park. The
Diamondbacks won in 10 innings, 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the home runs that angered Stottlemyre, but what Sosa
did afterward.
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa joined a group of major-league all-stars for a tour of
Japan after the season, he started a habit of bowing to the fans
after hitting a home run. He decided to carry that over to this
season, to show the fans his appreciation for their support during
his home run chase with the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting a two-run shot to right field off Stottlemyre in
the first inning, Sosa bowed to the fans about halfway between the
plate and the Cubs' dugout. It was the sixth spring homer for Sosa,
who hit 66 last season.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and nobody on in the third, Sosa hit one deep to
left center on a 3-2 pitch for his seventh spring shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have respect for Sammy and what he's done as a player. He's
a great hitter and has busted his (expletive) to get where he is.
But I've busted my (expletive) to get where I am, too,''
Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did caught me off-guard. That has no (expletive) place
in this game. I don't bow after I strike somebody out or get
somebody out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like an (expletive) bullfighter out there. I
guarantee you that Mickey Mantle never (expletive) bowed and he hit
damn near 600 of them. I guarantee you Joe DiMaggio never bowed.
Lou Gehrig. Roberto Clemente. Jackie Robinson. The guys who paved
the way for us, the reason why we have it so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the bows, Sosa said, ``I don't see why anybody would
take it personal. I'm just showing respect for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that Stottlemyre thought it showed lack of respect for
him, the smile left Sosa's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre said he is not one to hold a grudge, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never make excuses,'' he said. ``I gave him some pitches
he could handle. I wanted to get even by striking Sammy out the
second time, and on the 2-2 pitch (a slider), every ounce of
competitive juice wanted that call.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stottlemyre didn't get the strike call from umpire Greg
Bonin. He jawed at Bonin, and Manager Buck Showalter came out to
deflect return fire from the umpire, adding a few words himself.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who was removed from the game by Showalter after
issuing a two-out walk in the third, was ejected by Bonin in the
top of the fourth. Sitting in the dugout, Stottlemyre questioned a
couple of pitch calls to Arizona leadoff man Andy Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the pitch and thought he got the hitter out,''
Diamondbacks pitching coach Mark Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter's take on the situation: ``My pitcher needed to get
some work done and I was trying to keep him from being run. The
bows? The fans seem to like it, but `Stott' didn't.'' &QL;

BILLYBALL FOLDS SHOW BEFORE HITTING BROADWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ New York would have been a grand stage for
Billyball, but TCU won't be doing Broadway this year. The closest
the Frogs will get to the big city is if they tune in to ``Saturday
Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Needing one more rousing Billyball performance in front of the
home crowd to earn a round-trip ticket to the National Invitation
Tournament semifinals at Madison Square Garden, Team Schizophrenia
submitted another edition of Sybilball instead.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about those Frogs, you never know who's going to show
up.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon _ quicker, faster, and in the end, better _ ended the
Frogs' season with a 77-68 victory in front of 6,036 at
Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to wait by the phone,'' coach Billy Tubbs quipped
in his best Jack Nicholson style after the Frogs' season took its
final breath. ``I'm sure there's another tournament out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, that Billy. He would have been a riot on the Great White
Way.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs' strange season ended with an overflow of would-haves
and could-haves.
</P>
<P>
   What would have happened if the Frogs had come out last night
with the same intensity, the same passion that marked Monday
night's heart-pounding, ear-throbbing victory against Nebraska?
</P>
<P>
   That electricity, some of it supplied by a raucous sellout
crowd, was missing last night.
</P>
<P>
   So were most of the Frogs' shots. They shot only 38 percent for
the game and scored a season-low 28 points on 11-of-36 (.306)
shooting in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we had the lead at halftime,'' Tubbs said, ``I
didn't feel all that good about the way we were playing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was going to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   By the final 10 minutes of the game, it appeared that Tubbs'
six-man rotation was running out gas. Players' shots were finding
more iron than net. Defensively, the Frogs were having a hard time
keeping up with the Ducks' mercurial guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think fatigue was as much a factor as some things we
did offensively,'' Tubbs said. ``Most of the shots we missed, we
had no one in position to rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the balanced scoring that marked the victory against
Nebraska when all five starters were in double-figures. Instead,
the Frogs had Lee Nailon and his 27 points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Good, but not nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Frog in double figures was Vladimir Jaksic, who
managed to make 4 of 8 3-pointers for 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Marquise Gainous, who was so vibrantly alive and energized
against the Cornhuskers, made only 3 of 10 and finished with 9
points. His misses turned him into a lifeless post, lingering
beyond the top of the key. Ryan Carroll was 3-of-12, Prince Fowler
3-of-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We jacked some shots pretty quick,'' Tubbs said, ``and didn't
have enough patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Read that quote again carefully. Did you ever think you'd hear
Billy Tubbs complain about his team shooting too fast and not being
more patient?
</P>
<P>
   But then, this wasn't your normal Billy Tubbs team, as we
discovered in the season's final 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unusual season,'' Tubbs said. ``We had a lot of
opportunities we didn't capitalize on. We may have played above our
capabilities at times.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be as close as you'll ever get Tubbs to admit that
the team we saw in the second half was probably more the real Frogs
than the one that zipped off to a 13-2 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the guys who are coming back can be hungrier than we
were going into this season,'' Tubbs said. ``It wasn't that we
lacked heart. The guys had heart. My wife has a lot of heart, too,
but she can't go out there and force turnovers when we need them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs knew this season _ and any hopes of playing their way
to the Garden _ was gone when the Ducks got back-breaking
3-pointers from A.D. Smith, Darious Wright and Terik Brown down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait till 1 o'clock,'' Tubbs said, ``and if
nobody calls, then this season is over.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounded almost relieved. \Ntagtop:Jim Reeves, (817) 390-7972

D-BACKS WAIVE BENITEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. - The Diamondbacks cleared room on their 40-man
roster for the arrival of Korean right-hander  &UR; Byung-Hyun Kim by
asking for waivers on outfielder  &UR; Yamil Benitez for the purpose of
giving him his unconditional release.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Benitez was selected from Kansas City in the
expansion draft and hit .199 with nine home runs and 30 RBIs in 91
games. This spring, he was 3 for 15 with no homers and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 14 against San Francisco, Benitez became the first
player to hit a ball that came in contact with a girder supporting
the retractable roof of Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks added several outfielders to their roster over
the winter, and Benitez became a victim of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy thing to do,'' General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola
Jr. said. ``We wanted to do this in a way that was as fair as
possible to Yamil, to give him time to attempt to hook on with
another team rather than waiting until the end of the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kim, he is to report sometime next week. Club officials
will watch him throw a few times before deciding where to assign
him. &QL; 
Not ready for Teddy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks were considering signing 40-year-old
left-hander  &UR; Teddy
 &UR; Higuera to a minor league contract, but after watching him pitch
Saturday in Tucson and again at Mesa's HoHoKam Park on Wednesday,
the chances of completing a deal are highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Higuera, who resides in the Valley, was 94-64 with a 3.61 ERA
for the Milwaukee Brewers from 1985 to '94 and more recently
pitched in his native Mexico, where he caught the eye of  &UR; Derek
Bryant, a manager in the Diamondbacks' minor league system.
Higuera's agent arranged for the tryout with Diamondbacks Assistant
General Manager  &UR; Sandy Johnson and  &UR; Junior Noboa, the club's Latin
American scouting director. &QL; 
Williams heating up &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman  &UR; Matt Williams continued to gain momentum with the
bat after a slow start, driving in three runs with a two-run double
and a solo home run, his first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he even broke his bat on the home run,'' Manager  &UR; Buck
 &UR; Showalter said. &QL; 
What a relief &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After right-hander  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre was roughed up by the
Chicago Cubs'
 &UR; Sammy Sosa on Wednesday, Arizona's next four pitchers pitched
admirably.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Vladimir Nunez gave up a pair of runs on two hits
in two innings, but also struck out two batters. One was Sosa in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez dropped down for a sidearm release on a couple of pitches
to Sosa and got him looking on a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an impressive sequence of pitches,'' pitching coach
 &UR; Mark
 &UR; Connor said. ``I like what I'm seeing from him right now. He can't
get careless, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Dan Carlson pitched two scoreless innings and
struck out two to get credit for the victory, and right-hander
 &UR; Aaron Small set the side down in order in the 10th to chalk up the
save. &QL;

DISNEY TAKEN TO TASK IN SUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal judge has given class-action status to a
lawsuit accusing The Walt Disney Co. of illegally charging for
health benefits for 4,000 retirees and longtime employees.
</P>
<P>
   The certification, issued Tuesday by U.S. District Court Judge
Terry Hatter Jr. in Los Angeles, represents a potentially
embarrassing legal battle over the treatment of employees who
helped make Disney a global entertainment giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney's got some dirty hands on this,'' said Robert Carbines,
one of the seven plaintiffs and a 32-year maintenance worker at
Disneyland who retired in 1991 at the age of 62. ``I feel strongly
that we're going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute revolves around two moves by Disney to change its
longtime policy that 20-year employees receive free medical
coverage once they turned 62. In 1994, Disney boosted the age of
eligibility for free coverage to 65; in 1995, it began charging
premiums unless the retiree joined a health maintenance
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has contended its contracts allowed it to impose charges
when the costs of coverage increased. But Carbines said Disney's
pledge of free coverage was explicit for any employee meeting three
conditions _ 20 years service, 30,000 hours of work and at least 62
years old. A Disney representative repeated that pledge in 1990 at
a meeting for employees considering retirement, Carbines asserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until 1994, all the paperwork and promises said we would
get benefits at no cost,'' Carbines said. ``It was all in black and
white with no fine print. When I got the letter in 1995 that they
had the right to make changes, it was like being hit by a
locomotive.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbines, who lives in Fullerton in nearby Orange County, said
he pays a quarterly premium of $255 for HMO coverage for himself
and his wife, who is receiving chemotherapy treatments. ``The
result is that even with Medicare, you end up paying a tremendous
amount of money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatter previously certified the suit, which seeks to restore the
benefits to the affected employees, as a class action, but
attorneys subsequently announced in November 1997 that they had
reached an agreement in principle calling for Disney to reduce
premium costs. However, that deal subsequently collapsed amid
accusations that Disney planned to make changes not agreed to in
the settlement, such as doubling yearly out-of-pocket costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they reneged, we had no choice but to continue to press
forward on behalf of the thousands of Disney workers covered by the
lawsuit,'' said plaintiffs' co-counsel William Payne in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Disney issued a statement Wednesday: ``We are disappointed that
the previous settlement has been dissolved but will go forward with
defense of our position.''
</P>
<P>
   The company had no further comment.

INJURY WAITING TO HAPPEN  
 WOOD BELIEVES ME CHANICS AT FAULT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MESA, Ariz. - It was stored in Kerry Wood's memory bank, next to
the Rookie of the Year season and the 20-strikeout performance
against Houston: The crack heard 'round the world.
</P>
<P>
   When Wood was 12, he saw footage of San Francisco pitcher Dave
Dravecky breaking his left arm against Montreal in 1989. The
injury, which the Expos' Hubie Brooks said sounded like a
firecracker, caused Dravecky to fall to the ground in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the first time I saw that video,'' Wood said Wednesday,
``I knew that any given day, it could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It did. Although the injury is different _ Wood, 21, suffered a
full ligament tear in his right elbow _ it is devastating. Surgery
and rehabilitation will keep the Chicago Cubs pitcher out of
baseball for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm to a point where I've realized I have no other choice,''
he said at HoHoKam Park after flying in from Chicago on Tuesday
night. ``I'm just going to get it done as soon as possible. I've
known guys who have had the surgery and come back to the level they
were, and some that were even throwing harder and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is seeking a second opinion, he is expected to
undergo surgery within two weeks. Commonly known as Tommy John
surgery, a tendon from Wood's left wrist will be used to replace a
ligament in his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, who missed all of September with what was termed sprained
ligaments, threw 26 pitches on Saturday against Anaheim in his
first spring appearance. It is believed he suffered the injury
while throwing his first warm-up pitch before the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Some have criticized the Cubs for bringing Wood back last
postseason and risking injury, but the pitcher was quick to defend
his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not fair to say, to blame a team or an individual,'' he
said. ``To me, I've seen tape of my mechanics last year, and my
mechanics weren't as good as can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood suggested his mechanics _ throwing across his body _ put
extreme stress on his elbow and could have contributed to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs Manager Jim Riggleman acknowledged that Wood's injury ``was
inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had his ups and downs and I was holding my breath a
bit,'' Riggleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he has a sense of what's in store for him in the
coming year because he watched what Cubs pitcher Jeremi Gonzalez
had to endure last season.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's season ended abruptly in July after 20 starts because
of a severe elbow injury that required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you're going to have good days and bad days, maybe even
bad weeks,'' he said. ``I know he struggled at times because he
didn't feel like part of the team. It would be tough for me to come
to the park and not feel like part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the first chance Wood had to see his teammates. If
first baseman Mark Grace's attitude is any indication, the pitcher
won't be made to feel like an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a great blow to us,'' Grace said. ``But the
thing we've got to do is make sure this kid feels like he's part of
the team. Even though he's going to be feeling bad and have a good
case of the blues, we've got to make sure he knows he's still a
part of this team and that we're behind him 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss could be devastating to the Cubs, who have watched Wood
become one of baseball's top attractions. He recently was awarded a
$690,000 salary, a record for a player with less than one year in
the major leagues.

MILLER MEETING WITH PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Cardinals free-agent linebacker Jamir Miller arrived
in Boston on Wednesday night and is scheduled to meet with the New
England Patriots today, the Patriots confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a 1994 first-round draft pick of the Cardinals, has
played his entire career with the club. He was their leading
tackler last season despite playing the final 13 games and the
playoffs with a dislocated wrist. He was considered by many to be
the most valuable player on the defense in the absence of injured
tackle Eric Swann.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who escaped having the franchise tag placed on him _ the
Cardinals instead placed it on wide receiver Rob Moore _ previously
interviewed with the Chicago Bears as he attempts to determine his
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to look at people who might be a good fit,'' said
Bobby Grier, Patriots vice president of personnel. ``We think he's
a good player. He made over 100 tackles last year and he's been a
good pass rusher. When they got (Andre) Wadsworth and (Simeon) Rice
they took on the nickel and dime rushing roles and Jamir's role was
diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have Chris Slade at strong side outside linebacker
but would be willing to move him to the opposite side if Miller
were to sign. Slade signed a new long-term contract last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have said they want Miller back. They have a
two-year offer on the table worth about $3 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said Wednesday that the club
continues to negotiate with Miller and his agent, Steve Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as long as you're doing that you've got a chance to get
something done,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, Cardinals vice president for player personnel,
acknowledged that Miller (6-foot-5, 266 pounds) is a big, strong
run stopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where we're weak,'' Ferguson said. ``We've said all
along that Jamir is a key player for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller has said that he wants to return to the Cardinals but he
wants to make certain that the team he signs with will use him
significantly as a pass-rusher. He considers that one of his skills
that has not been best used.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported initially that Miller was looking to become the
highest-paid in the league at his position, but Baker said what
Miller wants is the opportunity to establish himself as a pass
rusher, which in turn would escalate his value.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is one of four key unrestricted free agents the Cardinals
hoped to sign back. They also want to re-sign Moore, although
negotiations have slowed and are expected to remain slow now until
the summer. They successfully re-signed safety Kwamie Lassiter, the
NFC interceptions leader last season. They lost seven-time Pro Bowl
left tackle Lomas Brown to the expansion Cleveland Browns.

SAINTS WANT WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - New Orleans Saints Coach  &UR; Mike Ditka would do almost
anything to get a chance to draft Heisman Trophy winner  &UR; Ricky
Williams, the Texas running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would trade our whole (1999) draft,'' Ditka said Wednesday
at the NFL meetings at the Arizona Biltmore.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he also would include picks from future drafts, Ditka
said, ``Sure, why not? That's me. I just think he's that good. He's
 &UR; Earl Campbell with speed.''
</P>
<P>
   To get Williams, the Saints likely would have to go as high as
the second pick overall, owned by Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   When told of Ditka's statement, Eagles Coach  &UR; Andy Reid said he
would have to consider that.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as he was exiting the NFC coaches' breakfast, Reid tapped
Ditka on the shoulder and said, smiling, ``We'll make that trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints offered the Cardinals their entire draft last year to
move up to the No. 2 spot overall. But the Cardinals turned down
the trade and instead made a deal with San Diego, acquiring two
first-round picks, a No. 2 and two players.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans would have two problems making a deal to move up for
Williams. The Saints don't have a second-round pick, forfeiting it
to St. Louis in a trade for wide receiver  &UR; Eddie Kennison.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Saints' first-round pick of No. 12 overall is
probably further than the Eagles would want to drop. &QL; 
No kickoff change
</P>
<P>
   The owners didn't vote on placing the ball on the 25-yard line
instead of the 20 following touchbacks.
</P>
<P>
   They are scheduled to vote on it in May, but  &UR; Rich McKay, Tampa
Bay general manager who is co-chairman of the league's competition
committee, said there was ``sentiment not to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're tinkering with (changing) the yardage, people get
nervous,'' said Green Bay Coach  &UR; Mike Holmgren, the other
competition committee co-chairman. &QL; 
Logical explanation
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bills owner  &UR; Ralph Wilson, one of two dissenting votes
to giving Los Angeles an expansion franchise with conditions, said
he remains a supporter of the city's bid to become the league's
32nd team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think we should pit one city against another,''
said Wilson, referring to Los Angeles being given until Sept. 15 to
meet the NFL's hurdles or else the franchise goes to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The only other owner to vote against Los Angeles was  &UR; Al Davis,
who maintains he owns the rights to the city despite moving the
team to Oakland in 1995. &QL; 
Being flexible
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Cardinals lost starting left offensive tackle
 &UR; Lomas Brown to Cleveland in free agency, Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin won't
guarantee that the team will use one of its two first-round picks
on an offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is that there's a giant void at left tackle . .
. woe the Cardinals,'' Tobin said. ``Don't buy into that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're going to address the offensive line in the draft.
But to say that's the No. 1 spot . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said the Cardinals will miss Brown, but he is confident
Brown can be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lomas Brown was productive for many, many years,'' Tobin said.
``I hated to lose him. But at some point, we were going to lose him
because of his age (35). It's just that the timetable got moved up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plenty of time to address the left tackle position. We
have
 &UR; Anthony Clement, Matt Joyce. We could trade, get somebody in free
agency who becomes available after June 1.''

COWBOYS CLOSER TO REELING IN ISMAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Clarence E. Hill Jr. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carolina Panthers free-agent receiver Raghib Ismail wants to be
a Cowboy, a source told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his agent Jack Mula and the Cowboys are working to get it
done, with an agreement possibly coming as soon as Thursday. Mula
confirmed that a decision could come Thursday and denied that
Ismail has ruled out returning to Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's between Dallas and Carolina,'' Mula said. ``Each side has
given me their final proposals. It's just a matter of us picking
one. \RIsmail\S is supposed to let me know \RThursday\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The source said Mula has not been in contact with the Panthers
since last Friday, while talks with the Cowboys have intensified,
with both sides trading several contract proposals Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mula has said before that Ismail is looking for a contract
similar to the five-year, $16.5 million deal signed by 49ers
receiver J.J. Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   The source said the Cowboys have tweaked their offer by
increasing the signing bonus to $5 million from $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The added bonus, in addition to the fact that Ismail relishes
the opportunity to play with quarterback Troy Aikman and cornerback
Deion Sanders, helped the Cowboys gain Ismail's interest over
Carolina, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys land Ismail, he would be their biggest free-agent
acquisition since they signed Sanders in 1995. The contract would
be the most lucrative deal they've ever given to a player other
than Sanders who didn't start his career with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to make plays down the field last season had the
Cowboys going into the off-season with the primary focus of
acquiring a quality speed receiver to play opposite Michael Irvin.
Ismail, a former Notre Dame star, became the main target after a
breakout 1998 season with Panthers that included career-best
numbers of 69 receptions for 1,024 yards and eight touchdowns. His
previous season-best was 36 catches in 1997 with the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   A six-year veteran in the NFL, Ismail began his professional
career in the Canadian Football League in 1991, playing two seasons
with Toronto before joining the Raiders in 1993. He has played with
the Panthers the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail could be the first step in what could turn out as the
biggest free-agent haul in team history. Once the situation is
resolved, the Cowboys might turn their attention toward acquiring
former Pro Bowl center Mark Stepnoski and linebacker Quentin
Coryatt.  &LR; tagtop:Clarence E. Hill, Jr. (817) 390-7760

EVEN DUKE'S DOMINANCE CAN'T SOUR YOU ON THESE STORY LINES
</HEADLINE>
 16-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, it looks as if Duke is treating this NCAA Tournament the
way Jeff Gordon treats a NASCAR race, albeit in a decal-free
manner. But that doesn't mean we should fast-forward to March 29
and give Duke the title in a walk-over.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of stories unfolding in the 1999 version of
March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Kentucky coach Tubby Smith is in the Sweet 16 for
fifth time in six years. But did you know Smith has done so with
three schools _ Tulsa in 1994 and 1995, Georgia in 1996 and
Kentucky this year and last.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue, one of the record five double-digit seeds to reach the
second week, barely made the tournament as an at-large team. The
Boilermakers lost five of their last six games before winning their
first two tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his reaction would have been if someone had told him
he would be at the East Regional this week in East Rutherford,
N.J., Purdue forward Brian Cardinal had a simple answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have asked where my seat was going to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the middle week of the tournament, here are 16 Sweet
16 story lines to follow and ponder: 1. RARE SIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Florida senior guard Eddie Shannon is the winner of the United
States Basketball Writers Association's most courageous player
award. Shannon lost his vision in his right eye. He was hit in the
eye by a rock in the seventh grade. Vision in that eye
deteriorated. Finally, last fall, he had the damaged parts removed
and he was fitted with a prosthetic eye. 2. INSPIRING HERITAGE
</P>
<P>
   Auburn guard Doc Robinson is the nephew and grandson of key
organizers and participants in civil rights marches near Selma,
Ala., in 1965 that helped lead to voting rights legislation for
minorities. 3. HE IS THE WORLD
</P>
<P>
   No longer a secret weapon, the world now knows the World. Wally
``World'' Szczerbiak (pronounced: Zir-bee-ak) has led Miami of Ohio
to two victories. The versatile 6-foot-8 forward has scored 53.6
percent of his team's points (67 of 125). 4. REALLY BIG TEN
</P>
<P>
   For much of the season, the Big Ten Conference was ranked as the
nation's top league. Many basketball observers were cynical,
though, because the Big Ten had flamed out in recent NCAAs. But no
conference has more teams (four) still playing than the Big Ten. 5.
REALLY SMALL PAC-10
</P>
<P>
   Coaches in the Pacific-10 Conference clamored that their league
deserved five bids because of recent NCAA performances. Each of the
last two NCAAs, the Pac-10 had four teams reach the Sweet 16. This
year, all four Pac-10 teams are gone. 6. KID COACHES
</P>
<P>
   They led teams to the 1987 Final Four. Now, they're trying to
get back as coaches. Billy Donovan, 33, is in his third season at
Florida; Steve Alford, 34, is in his fourth season at Southwest
Missouri State. 7. MENTORING PROGRAM
</P>
<P>
   When Alford's Southwest Missouri State team faces top-seeded
Duke on Friday in the East Regional semifinals, it will be a
meeting of coaches from the Bob Knight Coaching Tree. Alford played
for Knight at Indiana; Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski played for Knight
at Army and was an assistant at Indiana. 8. GRIZZLED VETERANS
</P>
<P>
   While there are young whippersnappers like Alford and Donovan in
the Sweet 16, five veteran coaches are still hoping for their first
Final Four trip _ Iowa's Tom Davis (27 seasons), Connecticut's Jim
Calhoun (26), Temple's John Chaney (26), Maryland's Gary Williams
(20), and Purdue's Gene Keady (20). 9. YOUTH WILL BE SERVED
</P>
<P>
   Just one-third of the projected Sweet 16 starting lineups are
seniors. Players leaving early for the NBA have made college
basketball an underclassmen sport. 10. NEW FACES
</P>
<P>
   Six of the Sweet 16 teams have never reached the Final Four.
Other than Duke and Kentucky, only two have won championships
(Michigan State in 1979 and Ohio State in 1960). Outside of Duke
and Kentucky, the only other Sweet 16 team to reach the Final Four
this decade is Florida (1994). 11. OLD GUARD
</P>
<P>
   East Region top seed Duke and Midwest third seed Kentucky are
old hands at this NCAA Tournament stuff. They've combined for nine
championships, 24 Final Fours and 147 NCAA victories. Each has two
titles in the 1990s. Just one Final Four (1995) this decade has
been without either Duke or Kentucky. 12. REALLY OLD GUARD
</P>
<P>
   In NCAA terms, Kentucky's Wayne Turner is nearing membership in
AARP. He has played in a record 149 regular-season games and in 19
NCAA Tournament games. He's trying to become the fourth player to
participate in four Final Fours. 13. MAN WHO CAME TO RETIREMENT
</P>
<P>
   Tom Davis won't go gently into exile. Iowa's players are
delaying Davis' departure. The Hawkeyes are in the Sweet 16 for the
first time since 1988. Davis retired (or was asked to leave by
athletic director Bob Bowlsby) before the season. And wouldn't you
like to be reading Bowlsby's mail? 14. TRANSFER OF POWER
</P>
<P>
   If the seeds hold in the South, No. 1 Auburn will face No. 2
Maryland in the regional final. Each team features one of the
nation's top junior-college transfers: Chris Porter of Auburn and
Steve Francis of Maryland. 15. IN FAVOR OF UPSETS
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut and Duke are the only teams to be ranked No. 1 this
season in The Associated Press poll. Each is top-seeded in a region
(Connecticut in the West, Duke in the East) that was ravaged by
upsets the first weekend. The second, third and fourth seeds in
both regions are out. 16. HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE
</P>
<P>
   In its past five games in Charlotte Coliseum (three in the
Atlantic Coast Conference tournament, two in the NCAA Tournament),
Duke won by an average of 31 points while shooting 53 percent from
the field and 46 percent from 3-point range. Good news for Blue
Devils' opponents _ no more Duke games in Charlotte. Bad news for
East Regional opponents _ Duke is 8-0 in regional games in East
Rutherford, N.J., the site for the semifinal and final. nn

NEWHALL LAND GETS EARFUL FROM INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>

BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. _ Show us the money.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message from some Newhall Land and Farming Company
shareholders to Thomas Lee, chief executive officer and chairman of
the company's board, at Wednesday's annual unit-holder meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The company's share price _ well under analysts' estimates of
its value _ took center stage at the meeting despite the company's
record $304 million in revenues and $1.89 net earnings per unit in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders asked Lee about the company's attempts to promote
the firm to Wall Street and whether efforts were being made to
boost share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Lee acknowledged those concerns early, describing at the
beginning of his presentation how most real estate stocks have
suffered in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our unit price has been very disappointing, and I know that
has been frustrating for all of us,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as he fielded questions, Lee said the company is worth a
lot more than the company's own appraised value of about $30 a
unit. Referring to past estimates of the company that fell between
$25 and $50 a unit, Lee said the company ``clearly is in the upper
end of that range.''

   Newhall Land units closed up 12.5 cents Wednesday at $23.375 on
17,900 shares traded.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to boost its current unit value by expanding
income-producing properties, selling residential units and
developing the company's upscale Bridgeport development.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the company will also try to obtain most of the
remaining entitlements for its Valencia housing projects this year.
</P>
<P>
   With its new and continuing operations, Lee said, ``1999 could
well be another record year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   John Yaldezian, a financial adviser for Prudential Securities,
said many investors are frustrated with the company's unit price.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting tired of seeing everything else they can put
their money into go up while Newhall Land sits at $23 to $24 a
share,'' he said. ``There's a lot of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   But businessman Lou Amen, one of the company's larger
shareholders, said he was not concerned with the low unit price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see $35 a share right now,'' he said. ``I want
to buy it.''

TEKELEC SHARES POUNDED AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Things have gone from bad to worse this year for
telecommunications equipment maker Tekelec.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the firm based in Calabasas northwest of Los Angeles
fell 26 percent Wednesday, the first trading day after the company
announced it would miss analysts' first quarter earnings estimates.
On trading of 9.5 million shares, or roughly six times the 30-day
average trading volume for Tekelec, the stock dropped $2.8125 to
close at $7.9375.
</P>
<P>
   The drop corresponded to downgrades of Tekelec shares by
SoundView Technology Group, Volpe, Brown Whelan &AMP; Co. and BT Alex
Brown Inc., where analysts rated Tekelec shares a ``buy,'' ``hold''
and ``buy'' respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement released after the close of trading
Tuesday, Tekelec said lower-than-expected sales for both switching
and diagnostic products would push first-quarter earnings per share
below analysts' expectations and below earnings of a year ago.
Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected the company to
earn 11 cents per share for the quarter that ended March 31,
compared to 10 cents one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tekelec makes switching equipment used to transfer large
quantities of data across computer and telecommunications networks,
and the company also produces diagnostic tools used to optimize
network performance.
</P>
<P>
   Tekelec President and Chief Executive Michael Margolis said some
customers delayed major equipment purchases until after
industrywide year 2000 problems are sorted out, and sales will
likely remain weak until at least the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that our industry positioning and
longer-term outlook remains strong,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Tekelec, which employs about 450 people, has seen its shares
hammered over the last year on a string of disappointing news.
Since reaching a 52-week high of more than $25 in May, the stock
has lost more than two-thirds of its value.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, investors sent it down nearly a quarter after
Tekelec missed fourth-quarter earnings estimates by more than
15percent, prompting analyst Tim Savageaux of Volpe Brown Whelan
officially to declare the company ``in the Wall Street doghouse.''

OFFICER'S KILLER GETS SECOND CHANCE TO LIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sixteen years after LAPD Officer Paul Verna died
on the side of a road from six gunshot wounds, the convicted killer
strolled into court with a smile and another chance to beat the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   For Bryce Verna, the 25-year-old son of the slain Los Angeles
police Medal of Valor winner, the court appearance by killer
Kenneth Earl Gay on Wednesday was almost too painful to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these years, I thought the guy who killed my father was
going to die. I expected it,'' Bryce Verna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, I think this is ridiculous. He's trying to
weasel his way out of paying for what he did, and it's a pitiful
last-ditch effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a very good person. I loved him, and so did a
lot of other people. I hope this guy gets the death sentence again.
He deserves to die.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a judge ruled in December that Gay has one last chance
to save his own life because his attorney failed to represent him
adequately during the original sentencing hearing in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in San Fernando Superior Court, 41-year-old Gay
said he plans to mount his own defense in a new penalty phase
trial, despite admonishments from the judge not to expect special
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The mere presence of the lanky murderer noticeably disturbed
Paul Verna's widow, Sandra Jackson, as she sat in the front row.
</P>
<P>
   For Jackson, the hearing vividly brings back her painful loss
and reopens a case that seemingly won't die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be sitting in the courtroom through every day of
this hearing,'' she said, holding back tears. The sentencing
hearing is scheduled to begin April 5 and is expected to last seven
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another torturous step in Jackson and her family's
effort to bring Gay to justice. Jackson persevered through the
first trial and sentencing, and then she rallied enough public
support and outrage in 1994 to convince the Writers Workshop not to
peddle a script that Gay wrote on Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1994 interview with Daily News columnist Dennis
McCarthy, Jackson described Gay as a ``cruel and vicious person''
who has manipulated things to his own advantage for his entire
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess total outrage is the best way you could put my
feelings,'' Jackson said. ``The taxpayers have housed and fed him
on Death Row waiting for his execution, and what's he been doing?
Polishing his writing skills at the public's expense. There is
something totally wrong and sick about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor who sent Gay to Death Row on Sept. 20, 1985, was
flummoxed by the prospect that Gay might escape a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gay has a history of bad behavior on Death Row. He's been
on Death Row for a long, long time. That's where he belongs,'' said
Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Jeffrey C. Jonas.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he was murdered, Los Angeles police Officer Paul
Verna was 35, a motorcycle officer, an LAPD Medal of Valor winner
and the father of two boys. Verna made what appeared to be a
routine traffic stop June 2, 1983, of a car driven by Raynard Paul
Cummings, with 27-year-old Gay sitting in the passenger seat.
</P>
<P>
   The car had been stolen, and Cummings took out a gun and fired a
shot at Verna. Cummings then handed the gun to Gay, who got out of
the car, walked up to the fallen officer and fired five shots into
his body.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Verna left behind 4-year-old son Ryan,
9-year-old son Bryce and his wife Sandra. The family moved to
Oregon shortly after the murder, and Sandra recently returned to
Los Angeles and remarried. But the memories of her late husband
will never leave her.
</P>
<P>
   The case lingers, too.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-page letter to the Daily News in 1994, Gay vowed to
``stir the pot until the truth simmers to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately in our system of justice, guilt is assumed,'' he
wrote. ``It takes cash money to prove your innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, the state's highest court granted Gay a new
sentencing hearing, finding that his attorney, Daye Shin, lied and
mishandled Gay's defense during the original penalty phase of the
trial. Shin since has been disbarred for his action in an unrelated
case.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, not happy with his new court-appointed public
defender, Gay dismissed attorney Kenneth Lezin during the hearing
and opted to represent himself in his final attempt to convince a
jury that he deserves a life sentence without parole rather than
the lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not relieving Mr. Lezin for his need for more time to
prepare for a case. I have other important differences with Mr.
Lezin, tactical trial differences,'' Gay said. ``I'm aggressively
pursuing my right to a speedy trial,'' Gay told Judge Ronald S.
Coen.
</P>
<P>
   Coen warned Gay that ``self-representation is always unwise,''
and he told the convict to expect no special indulgence by the
court or additional library privileges at San Quentin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you know me, but we've never met,'' Coen said,
stressing to the defendant that he's been involved in 18 death
penalty cases as a judge and attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was charged myself with spitting on the sidewalk,'' Coen
added, ``I would hire myself an attorney.'' He then granted Gay's
request.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Jackson's new husband, Norm Jackson, an LAPD detective,
called Gay's decision to represent himself ``idiotic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question,'' Norm Jackson said, ``Gay deserves to
die.''

CLIPPERS NO SWEAT FOR CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Paul Pierce grew up in Los Angeles, participated in
local Police Athletic Leagues, played pickup games at Rogers Park,
and, yes, even paid attention to the second-class Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, I thought they were going to be the team of
the '90s,'' the Celtics rookie said of Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's opponent.
``They had Ron Harper, Mark Jackson, Danny Manning . . . they had a
nice squad.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus on the past is not coincidental, because the current
Clippers are a mess. And that was fine with the Celtics, who
thought they were a mess until they stepped on the court and saw
the very sad team from LA. By the time the Celtics finished an easy
night, their five-game losing streak was gone, and they were on a
plane headed for Milwaukee, laughing about a 118-84 win at the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   You probably shouldn't be wondering about this, but just in case
you are let's get it out of the way: The game was never close.
Never. The Clippers led, 14-10, in the first quarter, which led
Rick Pitino to call a timeout. But it wasn't a true lead, because
very few people among the 18,263 on hand would tell you that they
thought the Celtics were in danger. Pitino said before the game
that the Clippers were a dangerous opponent. Maybe he meant they
are a danger to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the night, Clippers coach Chris Ford was saying
the Celtics intimidated his players. And the Celtics were saying
what they wanted to say all along: We couldn't lose to these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a team we knew we could go out and beat,'' Ron Mercer
said. ``We were getting everybody back in the groove. Guys were
coming off the bench and scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason no Celtic was forced to play 30 minutes. The
first Clipper shot of the night? Airball. They finished the game
shooting 36 percent from the field, while the Celtics made 57
percent of their shots. It was a 5-point game after the first
quarter, but by halftime it was 54-39 and the only question was,
how high?
</P>
<P>
   As Mercer said, heroes were everywhere on the parquet and bench.
Kenny Anderson led all scorers with 21 points. He missed only two
of his 12 attempts and even snagged five rebounds. ``If you look at
my career, I've always been a rebounder,'' Anderson said, sounding
like a 6-foot-1-inch Wilt Chamberlain. But, then, that's what the
Clippers do. They boost your esteem as well as your win total. They
have played 22 games this season and lost 21 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a team we should beat,'' Anderson said. ``You look at
the percentages and we have to beat a team like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was disgusted with his team after the game, saying, ``I
just wish they'd come out and play with passion.'' Pierce could
tell Ford stories about several Clippers coaches wishing the same
thing before they were inevitably fired. The Celtics outrebounded
the Clippers, 56-37. They had passion. One of the passionate ones
was Vitaly Potapenko, the newly acquired 6-10 center. He had 14
points and 11 rebounds. He excited the crowd in the second quarter
when he ripped a rebound away from Lorenzen Wright, forcing a jump
ball. Wright wound up on the seat of his pants after Potapenko's
pursuit. The fans loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys told me there were great fans here, and I felt it
tonight,'' Potapenko said.
</P>
<P>
   He and everyone else. The more the Clippers put up their
airballs (at least four) and flubbed their layups, the more energy
the Celtics seemed to gain. They led, 82-66, after three quarters.
By that time, Tony Battie was working on a nice field-goal streak.
He made all four of his attempts against the Pacers Sunday. He made
his first six Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. He missed his next attempt, but
this is the kind of night it was: He grabbed the rebound and made
the putback. He finished with 14 points and 9 rebounds in 20 active
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a scorer in college, but I don't have to do that here
with the three guys we have here,'' he said, referring to Antoine
Walker, Mercer, and Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he was happy with the bench, happy with Anderson,
happy with the effort, happy with the 29 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed this for the team,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Minor had 13 points and five assists. Dana Barros had five
rebounds and six assists. The only complaint was from a merciless
crowd, which wanted the Celtics to shoot at the end for a nice
``120'' instead of ``118.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen. But the point was clear. The Clippers are
bad. Pierce was asked what people in LA said about them in his
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I can't tell you,'' he said. ``I don't
want anyone to get mad at me.''

BRUINS RUFFLE LEAFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ With a month to go, and no assurance that they'll be
north of the NHL's no-fly zone come playoff time, the Bruins made
their first visit to the Air Canada Centre Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night and
left with their confidence flying high.
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by Jason Allison's tiebreaking goal with 6:31 to go in
the third period, the Bruins knocked off the Maple Leafs, 4-1, and
dug an inch deeper into the eighth _ and final _ playoff spot in
the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big, big win for us,'' said Bruins wing Rob DiMaio, who
rocketed in a rare power-play goal for a 1-0 lead with 6:27 to go
in the middle period. ``It's definitely a confidence booster
because our schedule right to the end now is very demanding. It's
nice to beat a team like this.''
</P>
<P>
   These aren't the Maple Laffs any longer. They've got one of the
game's premier centers in Mats Sundin. In the offseason, they made
arguably the best free agent signing in the game's history when
they brought in Curtis Joseph to protect their net. They're not
among the elite challengers for the Cup, but they came in
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night ranked fourth overall in the Eastern Conference
with 84 points.
</P>
<P>
   A tie against the Leafs would be a point well taken.
</P>
<P>
   Two points taken, especially in their building, could provide
the Bruins with an emotional charge over the final four weeks of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big win, but that's all it is until the next one,''
said captain Ray Bourque, who has been at this chasing-a-berth
business for two decades. ``We got two good points, especially on
the road, so we'll put our two points up there and wait till the
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio's goal looked as if it might stand up for the two points.
A key to the club's top checking line, he came over the boards with
linemates Tim Taylor and P.J. Axelsson with only a few seconds
remaining on a man-advantage. Led slightly by a Grant Ledyard feed,
he moved to the outside of the right circle and unloaded a slapper
that beat CuJo to the near side, right post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw them out there because I didn't like what I'd seen
from our skilled guys,'' said coach Pat Burns, his club rebounding
well from an emotionless loss in Buffalo Saturday night. ``I put
them out, and they got the goal, and maybe those other guys got the
message.''
</P>
<P>
   The real spark for Boston didn't show, however, until the Leafs
tied it with 12:06 to go in the third, ending Byron Dafoe's bid for
a career-high eighth shutout. Parked in the middle, tough guy Tie
Domi gloved a Bryan Berard shot and shoveled the puck to the right
of the slot, where Igor Korolev banged it in for the 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was Tie, and nothing against him, but when he gloved
it I was sure he'd shoot it,'' said Dafoe, whose record improved to
24-22-8. ``I thought for sure he'd spin around and shoot. But he
psyched me out, and he psyched my D-men (Dave Ellett and Ledyard),
and pushed it to the side. I don't even know who scored it.''
</P>
<P>
   But 5:35 later, sent away with a pretty Sergei Samsonov feed off
the left-wing board, a breaking Allison motored in from center ice
and beat CuJo with a doorstep wrister to the top right corner. The
finish took touch, but the key was the relay, Samsonov feathering
his backhander to center ice, just slightly behind Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Khristich banged in an insurance goal on the power play
with 4:49 to go. Anson Carter potted an empty-netter for the 4-1
final.
</P>
<P>
   The only blemish on the Bruins' night was a bungled Landon
Wilson penalty shot with 7:41 gone in the second. Hauled down
rodeo-style by Alexander Karpotsev, Wilson was immediately awarded
the free attempt from center ice by referee Steve Walkom. A former
Leafs first-round pick, Wilson took off from the red line, swooped
in, and lifted a wrister from the slot that sailed over the
crossbar and hit nothing but glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was back there saying, `Hey, leave him alone,' '' said
Burns, trying to keep Wilson's teammates from offering advice on
how to shoot. `` `C'mon,' I said, `Just shut up and let him go.' I
didn't want him to listen to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't excactly the shot heard 'round the world. When the
night was over, two points put away, it instead was a shot easily
forgotten.

PASADENA OFFICIALS DENY RAIDERS REPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Officials denied a report Wednesday that indicated
the City Council sent out feelers to Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis
about his plan to return the team to the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners meeting in Phoenix this week agreed to award Los
Angeles an expansion franchise in September if a suitable stadium
can be found and financing made available.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has long claimed that he owns the exclusive rights to the
area and that he plans to return some day, unless the league pays
him compensation for taking over the territory. Additionally, Davis
said he is not currently in negotiations with anyone in Los Angeles
about a return by the team.
</P>
<P>
   But when the unpredictable Raiders owner was asked if the
Pasadena City Council had contacted the Raiders, the Associated
Press reported his reply as, ``Oh, you heard about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena Mayor Chris Holden, whose father, Los Angeles City
Councilman Nate Holden, is an ally of Davis', said the city has no
current interest in wooing the Raiders to Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what (Davis is) talking about,'' Holden said.
``I've never talked to him about this issue, and there's nothing
that the City Council has been entertaining in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Raiders officials were unavailable for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Paul Little affirmed that the city has not
undertaken negotiations with the Raiders _ or any other NFL entity
for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has been in contact with Mr. Davis I would actually
hope that the City of Pasadena would support the L.A. Coliseum
effort to bring an expansion team to Los Angeles,'' Little said.
``That seems to be in our best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Little said he is about to propose a resolution backing the plan
currently favored by the NFL for bringing an expansion franchise to
the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl through its management, the Rose Bowl Operating
Company, has been a player in any deal to bring the NFL to Los
Angeles. It is likely the stadium would be a temporary home for a
team, while a permanent stadium is constructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said that the Rose Bowl would be an appropriate
venue for a transition facility,'' Holden said.
</P>
<P>
   Porfirio Frausto, a political appointee to the RBOC, who sits on
the football committee said it would be foolish to enter into any
agreement with Davis or the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be slicing our own throat to even entertain that,'' he
said. I'd be (upset) if something's going on behind our backs. But
... I just don't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Jacobs said Davis was likely attempting to manipulate the
NFL with his comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just stoking the fire,'' Jacobs said.

CLIPPERS' TAILSPIN NEVER ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Celtics were back home Wednesday night. They were
coming off an 0-5 road trip, one which had Rick Pitino noting they
were a much better team at the end of the trip than at the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, the Celtics were a much better team Wednesday
night than the one they played. Only a few, very lucky Eastern
Conference teams _ Boston, New York, and Toronto _ have the
privilege of hosting the Clippers this season. It's as close to an
automatic W as there is.
</P>
<P>
   It was a year to the day _ March 17, 1998 _ that the Clippers
last won a game on the road. That was in Golden State. There were
eight more road losses at the end of last season and 11 more this
season. The 118-84 drubbing at the hands of the Celtics dropped
them to a Washington Generals-ish 1-21. If they lose their next
three, they will be on a two-win pace for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Someone once noted that the definition of modern art was that
you put the picture over a hole in the wall _ and then take it down
because you decided you liked the hole better. That's the sad,
almost inevitable fate of the Clippers. People come and go and
cover the hole, but in the end, the hole still looks a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   They were beyond horrible Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. They didn't defend,
they didn't rebound, they didn't shoot, but, worst of all in coach
Chris Ford's mind, they just didn't care. After 22 games, Ford said
he had seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when coaches have to sugarcoat things,'' he
said, ``but there are times when you also have to tell it like it
is. Now is that time. I find it difficult to sugarcoat things. You
have to play with a passion. You owe it to the fans, to everyone
else, to play this game with a passion. You can go out there and
get clocked, but dammit, at least go out there and play your heart
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino had called the Clippers ``a dangerous opponent'' and they
are in this sense: Playing them now is as close to a no-win
situation as you're going to get in a league that counts wins and
losses. You lose to the Clippers, you end up leading the late
edition of ``SportsCenter.'' You beat them, you might not even
warrant a video highlight, although it does count the same in the
standings as a win over a real team.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino noted the Clippers go ``10 deep,'' although three of
those 10 are lads by the names of Charles Smith, Tyrone Nesby, and
Darrick Martin, all of whom started the season and probably belong
in the CBA. But even the supposedly gifted Clipper players _ and
they have a few _ Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night looked like the last place they
wanted to be was on a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want professionalism from your team. They're putting on an
NBA uniform,'' Ford said. ``It's supposed to be the elite league in
the world. You'd think they'd have some passion to play the game.
You can forget money and all that. Go out and accept the challenge
and do what it takes to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might be undermanned or undersized, but nothing should
stop the passion. I don't care what the score is, or who the
opponent is, or where the game is being played. Respect the game
enough that you'll go out there and play with a passion. That's all
I want.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers were outscored in all four quarters, including a
humiliating 36-18 in the fourth. They allowed Greg Minor to merit
postgame consideration from the media. Prior to the game, veteran
Sherman Douglas sounded disgusted as he talked about the attitude
he sees.
</P>
<P>
   Someone made the mistake of asking Douglas if the Clippers' new
arena, scheduled to open next season, would be a plus. Douglas
looked mystified.
</P>
<P>
   ``A building doesn't score points,'' he said. ``You need
players. And direction. You need a game plan from the front office
all the way down. When you've been here a long time, you accept
losing. That's one of the biggest bridges we have to cross. You
can't accept losing.''
</P>
<P>
   We got our first look at center Michael Olowokandi. He's making
progress, but he's a project. There aren't many No. 1 picks who
know more about cricket and rugby than basketball, but the Candy
Man does. He's big, mobile, and supposedly a quick study, but Ford
wants him to take the ball into the middle and the first three
times the rook got the ball low, he went baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to play the way the coach wants us to
play,'' Olowokandi said. He hesitated, adding, ``although we make a
lot of mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, of course, knew exactly what the situation was, but it
does beat unemployment _ barely. Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, he looked like
that Buckingham Palace guard in the television commercial who
stands stoically on the sidewalk waiting for his uniform to come
back from the cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   A comedian once noted that he didn't like taking exotic or
dangerous vacations because ``my idea of a vacation is not to have
to worry about dying.'' That's how Ford must feel. If he keeps his
sanity, and what's left of his hair, then this will have deemed to
have been a successful season. No one waits till next year. They
try to survive this one.

RESILIENCY MARKS TUGNUTT'S CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Guy Hebert jokes that Ron Tugnutt probably still has
that ``big goofy grin and looks like ``he's going to do your taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But on a serious note, Hebert says the bookish-looking Tugnutt,
who has a league-leading 1.67 goals against average, deserves a lot
of credit for turning his career around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot about him, said Hebert of his former teammate.
``To go down (to the minors for the entire 1995-96 season) and make
it back ... he's a pretty resilent guy. It's a great story.
</P>
<P>
   Tugnutt, who played 28 games for the Ducks in '93-94, good
naturedly said he looked Anaheim's first team picture and ``I think
he (Hebert) has lost some hair.
</P>
<P>
   When it was Tugnutt's turn to get serious the Ottawa goalie said
his year in the American Hockey League ``makes times like this so
much better.
</P>
<P>
   Tugnutt also said he would have retired before the '96-97 season
if he hadn't caught on with a NHL team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was good enough to play, he said. ``I was lucky that
(then Ottawa GM) Pierre Gauthier felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting out: Fredrik Olausson was scheduled to sit out
Wednesday's game due to various aches and pains, including a pulled
side muscle. But the Anaheim defenseman was forced to play when
Jason Marshall became ill before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Returns: After a nine-game stint with Cincinnati of the AHL,
Johan Davidsson returned to the Ducks' lineup, playing with Jim
McKenzie and Antti Aalto.
</P>
<P>
   Davidsson, who had one goal and seven points with Cincinnati,
had three goals and seven points in 51 games with the Ducks before
being sent down on Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets: Anaheim announced that single-game tickets for the
Stanley Cup playoffs will go on sale at 9 a.m. Saturday, March 27
at the Pond box office and TicketMaster outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert to start: Hebert, who was given both Sunday and Monday
off to recharge his batteries is expected to start tonight's game
against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim goalie has played in 58 of Anaheim's first 68 games.
With 14 games remaining he could set a career-high in games. Hebert
played in 67 in the '96-97 season.

   PHOENIX _ Los Angeles has been given a six-month window of
opportunity by the magnanimous National Football League to produce
a worthy expansion package.
</P>
<P>
   To this, the groups representing Carson and the New Coliseum
humbly say thank you. Now all they need is to be told exactly what
the league wants.
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps the strangest component to the game the NFL
played this week here with L.A. With sweeping gestures and voices
dropped an octave for effect, owners expressed several concerns
about the two L.A. groups, from the financing of the stadium to the
suggested brand of toilet paper in the luxury suites.
</P>
<P>
   But when pressed for specifics, exactly what they do or do not
like and what specifically needs to be done, many owners admitted
they haven't a clue. They haven't even seen copies of the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know,'' said Buffalo owner Ralph C. Wilson, one of
two dissenters in the vote Tuesday giving L.A. a six-month leash.
``We didn't really get a recommendation from the (expansion)
committee. That's why we gave them six months. They'll find out if
L.A. is viable or not and come up with a recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners who are on the expansion committee may know,'' said
one team executive on background. ``But they really haven't told
us. That's one reason we had so much trouble this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The league hasn't said much to those intimately involved with
the Carson and Coliseum proposals, either. The league has yet to
tell either group what needs to be solved in the proposal, how much
it wants in a franchise fee, and how large the public investment
must be.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the full ownership heard either group was at a
special meeting in October. ``And I can't imagine a lot of owners
remember what they heard back then,'' said the team exec. The
expansion committee heard brief, 30-minute updates from the two
groups in January.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion committee is scheduled to come to L.A. in early
April to meet with both ownership groups and visit the sites. The
committee's mandate is to select one site by mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   You would think -- and hope -- that L.A.'s NFL future wouldn't
come down to one road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Sweeney, the Carson city councilman who has been on the
front lines of the bid, welcomes the league to study ever nuance of
the bid and tell the city exactly what it needs to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want feedback,'' said Sweeney. ``We want the chance to show
the league what we've covered to date, the chance to answer any of
their concerns. If something is important, tell us. We're ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner came out here and said he was satisfied with
the environmental report on the site, said we were further along in
the process. But I kept reading and hearing owners this week say
they had environmental concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Michael Ovitz, the chairman of Artists
Management Group who is speaheading the Carson project, said Ovitz
has no sense of what the league may want or need. But he added that
Ovitz is also not particular concerned about it, either, because
his proposal is viable and he's willing to do whatever the league
asks.
</P>
<P>
   The New Coliseum group has had a similar reaction to hints that
the league wants a broader base of owners involved if it is to
return to the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   When the expansion committee questioned Ed Roski's debt load in
January, the Kings owner responded by adding billionaire Eli Broad
to the team and making him the principal owner, the man responsible
for the 30 percent investment in the team.
</P>
<P>
   Roski said Wednesday that if the league wants broader
participation, he's willing to listen. ``We already have a good
cross section of business people, but if the league suggests
someone else, we're open to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Published reports have said the league would like Roski to take
a less prominent role, but Roski said he's never been told that by
anyone in the NFL. Sources close to Roski said the group will be
adding a new equity partner to the team before the NFL visit. A
source also said that while Fox and Dodgers owner Rupert Murdoch
has a stake in the Staples Center, the Lakers and Kings, plus the
Sunday NFC TV rights, he has no plans to get involved in the L.A.
NFL debate.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the league will apparently cram all of
its due diligence and arm-twisting into the next six weeks. The
expansion committee is co-chaired by Carolina owner Jerry
Richardson and New England owner Bob Kraft, and it has been given
the power to shape the L.A. proposal the way it wants.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be as easy as asking the two parties to join forces.
Roski and Broad, actively committed to the redevelopment of
downtown L.A., are committed to the New Coliseum
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz was once approached by Roski to join the Coliseum group
and only has a memorandum of understanding in Carson. But he says
he and partner Ron Burkle are committed to Carson.
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum has also received an endorsement from Disney's
Michael Eisner, too, who hired Ovitz away from the agency he
created and then fired him a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I hate this leverage game we're playing,'' said
Wilson, the Bills owner. He's not alone.

JOCKEY VALENZUELA ORDERED TO APPEAR FOR ARRAIGNMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL MONTE, Calif. _ Ex-jockey Pat Valenzuela was ordered
Wednesday to appear for arraignment in Superior Court on suspicion
he robbed a cabbie of $150 at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Valenzuela, 36, faces one count of robbery with the
special allegation that he used a gun to commit the crime. If
convicted, he faces a maximum of 16 years in prison, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arraignment is set for March 31 at 8:30 a.m. He has pleaded
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, of El Monte, was once one of world's best jockeys.
In 1989, he rode Sunday Silence to victories in the Kentucky Derby
and Preakness. He also rode winners at the Santa Anita Handicap and
the Santa Anita Derby on two occasions each.
</P>
<P>
   But, a string of drug-related problems, misdemeanor criminal
charges and brushes with the boards of stewards at various tracks
caused him to lose his rider's license. He was suspended from
racing in October 1997 and has not raced since.
</P>
<P>
   A motion by Valenzuela's attorney to dismiss the robbery case
for lack of concrete evidence linking the jockey to the robbery was
denied. Another motion to release the ex-jockey on his own
recognizance was also denied.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rio Hondo Municipal Court Judge Francis A. Gately
ordered Valenzuela's bail reduced from $70,000 to $40,000.
Valenzuela's sister said a bond freeing the jockey from custody
would be posted by this morning.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Jose Valdez, a driver for the Green Valley Cab
Company, testified through an interpreter that around 11 p.m. on
Feb. 24, he was dispatched to a home in the 2700 block of Gladys
Avenue in Rosemead.
</P>
<P>
   His fare, a clean-shaven man about 5-foot-6 or 5-foot-7,
weighing 140 to 150 pounds clad in a dark jacket and wearing a
baseball cap, was waiting outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got in the taxi and asked me if I was really busy that
night,'' Valdez recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, who wears a mustache and goatee, is 5-4 and weighs
125 pounds. The suspect, whose face Valdez did not see clearly,
asked to go to El Monte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was maneuvering (the cab) to back away and go to El Monte
and at the same moment he took out a gun and put it to my
stomach,'' Valdez said. ``My reaction was that if I struggled he
would probably unload it on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The robber took $150 in ones, fives, tens and twenties; then
fled into the night, Valdez testified.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than 24 hours later, Valdez said he was dispatched
to Spike's Bar on Garvey Avenue in Rosemead. At the bar, a man who
intended to take a cab home, declined Valdez's services.
</P>
<P>
   As the cabbie prepared to leave the dimly lit bar, he was
approached by a second man who asked for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez testified that because of the tone of the man's voice, he
believed he was speaking to the same person who had robbed him.
</P>
<P>
   At that point in the testimony, prosecutor Katie Albrecht asked
Valenzuela to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-jockey, handcuffed to a chair, and clad in a white dress
shirt, wool pants and oxford shoes recited twice: ``Take me to El
Monte.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdez then said Valenzuela's voice wasn't the same voice he
heard during the robbery.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 11 of Valenzuela's friends and family members
attended the hearing. His sister, Christine Wing, said the
prosecution case was ``unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat didn't do this she said. ``There's a lot of evidence to
show that.''

SENATORS RALLY TO TIE DUCKS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Ottawa Senators had every reason to throw
in the towel. They were down by two goals, playing in California,
where they had won only twice in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   But these aren't the Ottawa Senators of old and they rallied to
tie the Anaheim Mighty Ducks 2-2 Wednesday night at the Pond before
16,026.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 2-0 in the second period, the Senators
dominated the majority of the game. And when they didn't, goalie
Damian Rhodes came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes stopped what appeared to be the go-ahead when he jammed
his left leg pad against the post to stop Marty McInnis, who had
been set up by Tomas Sandstrom with just over two minutes to play
in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks got a big break midway through the first period when
Marian Hossa appeared to have tied the game 1-1 just 70 seconds
after Pascal Trepanier had scored Anaheim's first goal in over
seven periods of play.
</P>
<P>
   Hossa beat Guy Hebert easily from close range after Radek Bonk
turned Ruslan Salei around with a couple of nifty moves and
centered the puck to his rookie linemate. But the video goal judge
ruled that Magnus Arvedson's skate was in the crease, even though
he appeared to be trapped in by Fredrik Olausson and Paul Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim, however, got no such breaks in the second period, at
least not after Matt Cullen hit the top, left corner of the net off
a centering pass by Jeff Nielsen to give the Ducks a 2-0 lead at
2:19. It was all Ottawa the rest of the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators swarmed all over the Ducks, outshooting them 15-3
and tying the score on goals by Alexei Yashin at 12:41 and Hossa at
17:47.
</P>
<P>
   Yashin scored his league-leading 39th goal of the year when his
shot from from a bad angle went through Hebert's legs. The play was
reviewed, but the power-play goal stood and soon the ice seemed
tilted toward the Ducks' net.
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne hit the post with a shot about a minute after
Yashin scored, but it was time for Hossa to show his stuff again.
</P>
<P>
   He was stopped by Hebert after he picked the pocket of Salei
with just under four minutes left in the period. But less than two
minutes later, Hossa made a nice move to get around Cullen and beat
Hebert high on the glove side.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had taken the early lead in the first period when
McInnis won a draw cleanly. The puck bounced off the boards to
Trepanier, who hammered home a 45-footer for his second goal of the
year. It was Anaheim first goal since the second period of last
Wednesday's 5-5 tie with Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks managed but one shot in the second half of the second
period. It was a good one, but Rhodes flashed out his left leg pad
to stop Kariya's bid from the slot after the Anaheim captain had
been set up by Selanne.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Ottawa Senators had every reason to throw
in the towel. They were down by two goals and playing in
California, where they had won only twice in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   But these aren't the Ottawa Senators of old. Instead of folding,
they rallied to tie the Anaheim Mighty Ducks 2-2 Wednesday night at
the Pond before 16,026.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a great team, they've got speed from the first line
through the fourth line,'' Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said. ``They
might be the best team we've played all year other than Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   The team that Mighty Ducks general manager Pierre Gauthier
helped mold, probably deserved even better. The Senators (38-20-9)
likely would have added another point to their Eastern
Conference-leading total of 85 had not a goal by flashy rookie
Marian Hossa been waved off in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 2-0 in the second period, the Senators
dominated the majority of the game. They outshot the Ducks 43-21
and on the rare occasion that Anaheim generated a scoring chance,
goalie Damian Rhodes was there to rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes' biggest save came with just over two minutes to play in
regulation when Tomas Sandstrom stripped John Gruden of the puck
and put a perfect backhand centering pass on the stick of Marty
McInnis, who was alone in front of the net. Somehow, Rhodes got his
left pad over to the post and stopped the Anaheim winger's
game-winning bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (McInnis) made a great move and the goalie made a great
save,'' said Hartsburg, who knew full well that his team would have
its hands full after Ottawa was shut out by the Kings on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they had lost two in a row and that they haven't lost
three in a row all season,'' said Hartsburg of the Senators, who
are only 2-12-2 in games played in California.
</P>
<P>
   The tie was a mixed blessing for the Ducks, who fell six points
behind fourth-place Phoenix and lead sixth-place St. Louis by only
three points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't complain, but we can't be satisfied,'' said Teemu
Selanne, whose best scoring chance of the night was a shot that hit
the post in the second period with the Ducks up 2-1 at the time.
``It's not our best game, but one point this time of year is
good.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning seven consecutive games, the Ducks are 0-2-2 in
their past four and have squandered a three-goal lead and a
two-goal advantage in the two ties. But Selanne says Anaheim must
look ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in good position, we want fourth, we can't look back,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' biggest break came midway through the first period
when Hossa appeared to have tied the game 1-1 just 70 seconds after
Pascal Trepanier had scored Anaheim's first goal in over seven
periods of play.
</P>
<P>
   Hossa beat Guy Hebert easily from close range, but the video
goal judge ruled that Magnus Arvedson's skate was in the crease,
even though he appeared to be trapped in by Fredrik Olausson and
Paul Kariya.

 SLUMPING ASIAN TRADE TAKES SPARKLE OFF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A dark sign has appeared in the midst of
California's continuing economic boom. Foreign trade, which helped
bring the state out of recession several years ago, is shrinking,
with no turnaround in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The economic crisis sweeping California's major trading partners
in East Asia has caused the state's exports to drop, costing
thousands of high-tech manufacturing jobs in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Governor Gray Davis and other elected Democrats in
Sacramento say, is to look south to Mexico and to the rest of Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Trade with Mexico and its neighbors has grown rapidly in recent
years, and California policymakers are planning an ambitious series
of initiatives to improve relations with Latin America and boost
trade.
</P>
<P>
   However, experts warn that although the new Latin gambit holds
promise, the difference between hype and reality will be hard to
sort out.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they say, aside from reaching out across the
southern border, Sacramento has no clear strategy to help
California navigate the fast-changing global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The new initiatives include:
</P>
<P>
   -- WOOING MEXICO. When Davis and top lawmakers traveled to
Mexico last month on a high-profile trade mission, they said the
diplomacy would bring lucrative new business for California.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mexico imported $13.3 billion from California, rising
from No. 3 among the state's export destinations to No. 2,
outpacing Canada. In the second half of the year, Mexico even
bested No. 1 Japan, which is trapped in a lengthy recession, and
Mexico is expected to keep the top spot in 1999 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures may be misleading. Much of the increase in
exports is in components sent to Mexico's maquiladoras, or border
assembly plants, where they are put together and sent back to
California. As a result, official data show an increase in trade,
yet critics say the only net effect is to transfer factory jobs
from California to low-wage Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of Mexico's potential, Davis brought home from last
month's trip a deal with Telmex, the Mexican telecommunications
giant, to move its U.S. headquarters from Houston to San Diego _ a
total of 600 new jobs for California, Telmex officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After the hype faded, however, company officials admitted that
the move will create only 20 jobs in California in the near future
and that the deal was under way before Davis took office.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Flores, Davis' top aide for Mexican affairs, says that
although results won't be immediate, ``we're establishing a good
relationship, and out of that will come good business and good
policy on lots of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is scheduled to make a
three-day visit to California in May, a sign that Mexico expects
the new relationship to produce concrete results.
</P>
<P>
   -- MAQUILADORAS. Davis and top lawmakers are planning to forge
close ties with Mexico's maquiladoras, hoping to create ``synergy''
between Southern California's white-collar industries and the
blue-collar brawn of Tijuana. The state Trade and Commerce Agency,
which is in charge of trade promotion, and influential lawmakers
such as state Senator Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, say
maquiladoras represent a lucrative source of contracts for
California firms.
</P>
<P>
   A provision in the North American Free Trade Agreement obliges
maquiladoras to cut their imports of components from Asia after
Jan. 1, 2001. Baja California's maquiladoras import $4 billion
annually from Asia, and Sacramento officials hope California
manufacturers will substitute much of that amount.
</P>
<P>
   However, some experts say that Asian corporations are now busy
building their own component factories in Mexico, leaving
California with little likely benefit from the 2001 change. In
addition, California's labor unions, which gave Davis crucial
support in his election campaign, complain about job losses to
Mexico and note that the Mexican government has a widely criticized
record of repressing independent unionizing in the maquiladoras.
</P>
<P>
   -- SOUTH AMERICA. Since the state opened its first foreign trade
office in Tokyo in 1987, the legislature has eagerly expanded the
number of offices _ which serve as the state's own embassies _ to
nine, and this year's budget includes money for four new offices,
including one in Brazil. Polanco, who calls South America
``California's biggest untapped market,'' is sponsoring legislation
to open an office in Argentina, too.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil and Argentina are indeed huge markets, part of Mercosur,
the region's prosperous trade bloc. Although they now rank only
16th and 25th among California's export markets, they have been
rising rapidly in importance, with big appetites for California
electronics, and electrical and transportation equipment.
</P>
<P>
   However, the timing of California's South American offensive
couldn't be worse: Brazil recently plunged into economic crisis,
pulling Argentina into recession.
</P>
<P>
   With or without the new Latin America focus, support among state
policymakers for foreign trade is strong and bipartisan because of
its undeniable economic logic. California is a giant on the
international economic stage, with exports exceeding those of all
but six nations. In the Bay Area, more than 1 in 4 jobs are
directly or indirectly linked to foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, California's foreign exports fell to $104.9
billion, a decrease of 4.2 percent from 1997. It was the first
decrease since state export records began in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco customs district, which includes the entire
Bay Area, the drop was worse: 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The trade slump has caused a wave of layoffs in Silicon Valley
and elsewhere. Last year, the number of manufacturing jobs in the
Bay Area decreased by 1.8 percent, a drop of 9,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The state government's economic policy now appears to be in a
period of drift, floating between the free-market philosophy of the
Wilson years and a Democratic strategy that is still undefined.
</P>
<P>
   State legislators, apparently waiting for leadership from Davis,
have refrained from reintroducing an ambitious series of bills that
were blocked by Wilson last year.
</P>
<P>
   The bills were influenced by the California Economic Strategy
Panel, an advisory group of business executives, labor leaders and
state officials that has advocated the creation of regional
alliances of business, academia and government.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis administration, in turn, appears in part to be waiting
for the panel, which is scheduled to release a series of policy
recommendations in April.
</P>
<P>
   The panel report is expected to recommend the creation of two
``clusters,'' or regional industrial alliances: around the
University of California's planned campus at Merced, which would
become the center of food-industry research and development; and in
Southern California's aerospace industry, which would be revamped
to focus on satellite communications.
</P>
<P>
   Both industries have huge potential for increasing exports,
especially to developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say they hope the panel's backing for alliances
between the public and private sectors will prompt a policy
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the state's foreign trade programs have been cobbled
together over the years without a coherent organizational strategy
and without much regard for the kind of services the private sector
would really like to see the state provide,'' said Jock O'Connell,
a trade consultant and economic policy analyst based in Davis,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state might be best advised to torch the whole edifice so
we can start over from scratch with a true private-public
partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Another recommendation of the panel is expected to be an attempt
to address the state's increasing income gap, under which all but
the top 20 percent of state wage earners have lost ground in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lon Hatamiya, secretary of the Trade and Commerce Agency, says
he wants to spread business opportunity more evenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to ensure more access by small and minority and rural
businesses, so that our programs don't just benefit large urban
business,'' he said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: How will Y2K B4U?
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, March 21, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ At first, I thought Y2K was a chemical element that I
never learned about in school _ like I thought AuH20 was a chemical
element until I found out it was just a simile, part of Barry
Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The more I hear about Y2K, the worse it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you hoarding cash for Y2K?'' someone asked me the other
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have to pay for it?'' I asked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously,'' she answered, ``you're going to need hard cash
when that calendar turns. The banks are going to have to shut down,
you won't be able to use your credit card, you're going to need
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And how much do you figure I'll need?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``About $10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   How long is this thing going to last?
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, who usually takes a vacation trip in January of
each year, canceled plans for January 2000; won't fly in a plane
until someone else successfully makes it.
</P>
<P>
   My, oh, my, what is going to happen to all those Jan. 1 football
bowl games, and the later Super Bowl? We are talking serious stuff
here.
</P>
<P>
   I am finding Web sites dedicated to selling survival supplies to
make it through Y2K. As I read down the list of offerings, there
was a familiar ring to it: generators, water containers, radios,
flashlights, medical supplies, cooking supplies...
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I buy those every year!
</P>
<P>
   Down here in the Hurricane Belt, this form of preparation is a
routine occurrence. Every June 1, with the official start of
hurricane season, I go to the stores and stock up on just about all
of the above-named items, plus batteries, Milk Duds, canned goods,
potato chips, bottled water, pretzels, propane...
</P>
<P>
   (Northerners who come to Florida often complain that we lack the
four seasons here, but we do have them: Rainy season, stone crab
season, tourist season and hurricane season; that's four.)
</P>
<P>
   People throughout the U.S., plagued by annual floods,
earthquakes, blizzards and tornadoes as well as hurricanes, are
amiss if they do not keep a hoard of emergency supplies.
</P>
<P>
   (Among the items offeredby one Web site as emergency supplies
were seeds. Question: What good will seeds be in Montana or Ohio in
January 2000?)
</P>
<P>
   So I'm not going out shopping for Y2K. If whatever is supposed
to go down on Jan. 1 does go down, I've got my leftover supplies
from the 1999 hurricane season that ends Dec. 1 _ that is, provided
we don't get nailed with a dead-on hurricane as we did in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, living as a homeless animal for three weeks after
Hurricane Andrew, I've become somewhat of a survivalist. That got
me to thinking about the $10,000 cash hoard I was advised to keep.
</P>
<P>
   After Andrew, when there was no electricity, no water, no stores
open, no gas stations operating, I recall telling a friend that if
I had a million dollars in my pocket those first days after Andrew,
they would be useless.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing available to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere I turn, there is concern about Y2K and the allegedly
imminent meltdown of the world's computers, upon which we have
become so dependent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean,'' I asked one of the ultra-concerned, ``that when
Y2K wipes out all its tapes, or whatever, that when I go to the
grocery store, the clerk will have to write down the prices on the
side of a paper bag with a big, fat pencil and add them up for me
like they did years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably so,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``No scanners, no automated cash registers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How soon can we get to December 31?''
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The pious for president
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had thought we'd be electing a president of the United States
next year, not the pastor of the United States, but much of the
Republican field seems to be running for a real pulpit, not just
the bully one.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole is a longtime but low-key churchgoer, and George
W. Bush, like Augustine of Hippo, got religion after he had pretty
much played out an unsustainably raucous youth and just in time to
run for the Texas governorship _ George W., that is, not Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   But look beyond those front-runners and their ordinary pieties
and you find a scramble of pseudo-seminarians trying out for
theocrat. (On the Democratic side all you find after Al Gore is
retired Sen. Bill Bradley, which is like finding Gore all over
again.)
</P>
<P>
   Here's Pat Buchanan with another campaign strongly inflected
with pre-Vatican II Catholicism. Perennial Alan Keyes is pure
preacher. Gazillionaire Steve Forbes wowed the pat-answer crowd
four years ago with his flat tax proposal but flopped fatally with
the religious right. He soon after saw the light on the road to
Washington and now answers to, if not God, at least Pat Robertson,
more anti-abortion than thou and yearning to fund religious schools
with some of that flat tax money.
</P>
<P>
   New to this contest in political homiletics is Gary Bauer, who
is running to save the Republican Party's soul and everyone else's
while he's at it. Bauer, a onetime Reagan political operative, is
on leave from his Family Research Council. His council stand-in
recently blasted Rep. Thomas Davis III, R-Va., for meeting with gay
Republican constituents.
</P>
<P>
   There are two factors inciting all this morality mongering.
Neither has much to do with morality.
</P>
<P>
   With Bill Clinton notoriously a cad at the very least, it was
inevitable Republicans would put themselves forward as
anti-Clintons, with moral indignation a short cut. That gives them
a quick leg up against Gore, who at best can position himself as
merely un-Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And fully 25 percent of the GOP primary electorate is
self-described as conservative Christian. Any planet that big
exerts a lot of gravity. Bush is struggling to find a way to
satisfy the anti-abortion GOP right without being dragged into
all-out abortion opposition. But how? California Republicans,
putting down a mild stir by moderates, recently elected a state
party chairman who holds that ``killing babies is the issue of the
century.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the religious-right candidates has a serious shot at the
nomination, but with so many whooping it up for that ol' time
religion, they serve their goal just by keeping the likes of Bush
and Dole from lapsing fully into moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Americans expect political leaders to be steadied by a spiritual
infrastructure. We are not a value-free people, but neither do we
go to the polls as sinners looking for salvation. Their party's
demanding religious right continues making it difficult for
Republican moderates to campaign as the pragmatists most voters
want rather than as surrogate preachers most voters don't want.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE PAYROLL TAX SCAM
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) business for release Sunday,
March 21.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Are taxes too high? Depends on what kind of taxes
you've got in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Take payroll taxes. They are supposed to fund Social Security,
Medicare, unemployment compensation and the like. Politicians are
fussing over how to raise these levies to ``save'' Social Security
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   But by any rational measure, payroll taxes should be cut. Since
many folks don't view these ``deductions'' as ``taxes,''
politicians get a free ride as they get ready to raise them once
again.
</P>
<P>
   Now take income taxes. They are supposed to fund everything
else, including defense. Politicians are fussing whether to grant
voters an across-the-board cut, as most Republicans want, or
targeted cuts, as the White House would prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Income taxes are based on the idea that the more you have, the
more you should pay. That's why they should be raised. The new
influx should then be used to slash payroll taxes, which are paid
equally by all workers earning up to $72,600, when the 7.65 percent
Social Security tax disappears.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there's no chance that such a shift in the balance
of payments into the federal till will occur any time soon. But
that truth is driven by politics, not by economics.
</P>
<P>
   If politicians were up front about the fact that income taxes
(which are progressive in nature) and payroll taxes (which are
inherently regressive) both go into the same common pot to pay for
the same things, then perhaps we might make some progress to
redress the lousy deal now facing most struggling wage-earners.
</P>
<P>
   Out of each tax dollar collected from individuals this year, a
full 35 cents will come from payroll taxes. Even more telling: Most
Americans now pay more in payroll taxes than they do in federal
income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of even a relatively well-off middle-class family
that stands to earn $85,000 in 1999. That family will pay an
effective tax rate of 16.3 percent. Not bad, you might say, until
you note that two of every five dollars will go to meet their
payroll obligations.
</P>
<P>
   In inflation-adjusted income, 20 years ago their payroll tax
bite would have been half of what it is today, while their overall
tax bite would be about the same: 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin D. Roosevelt, the father of Social Security, was the
first, but not the last, president to con us about the real nature
of the program. In his 1958 biography, ``The Coming of the New
Deal,'' Arthur Schlesinger quotes FDR as saying: ``I guess you're
right about the economics. But those taxes were never a problem of
economics. They are politics all the way through.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson's Social Security Advisory
Council conveniently found that ``people view receipt of assistance
(i.e. welfare) as meaning a loss of self-support. In contrast, they
view social insurance as an extension of self-support.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Bill Clinton's economic gurus argue that labor market
distortions are being minimized because workers tend to view
payroll taxes as deferred compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Those guys should be arguing over how rich people can help meet
the coming Social Security and Medicare crunches, rather than
trying to do the job by trimming services or lifting payroll taxes
anew.

   1. RESISTANT STRAINS MAKING TB CONTROL DIFFICULT A short
treatment for tuberculosis that has been adopted by the World
Health Organization may not be enough to control the disease in
populations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are common. By
Michael McCarthy. From The Lancet News Service. 1,000 words. 2. WHY
WE SHOULD NOT WRITE OFF RUSSIA Anatol Lieven, an editor at the
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, writes

_______________________________________________________________ 3.
ANTI-MISSILE PLAN RISKS RUSSIAN LOOSE NUKES Reports from Moscow say
there's a new chance for Russian approval of the long-blocked START
II treaty to reduce Russian and American missile arsenals. It is a
good sign at a time when Moscow-Washington relations are not very
good. The treaty urgently needs to be put into effect because the
deteriorated Russian economy is seriously losing the capacity to
safeguard nuclear weapons. By Flora Lewis. 800 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
WHAT'S DOING IN GENEVA As Easter approaches, it's the time of year
that Geneva shakes off its winter doldrums, stops being a way
station for skiers and comes into its own as a lovely flower-filled
city on western Europe's largest lake. By Elizabeth Olson. From The
New York Times. 1,500 words + photos + map. 5. FROM THE NEW YORK
TIMES BOOK REVIEW :
</P>
<P>
   A. THE MEDICIS' DECORATOR For all our appreciation of
Michelangelo, we understand little about the man. In ``Three Worlds
of Michelangelo,'' James H. Beck reaches the quality that lies
behind both his life and his work - his humanity. Patricia Fortini
Brown reviews this biography of Michelangelo and the men who
influenced him. 1,500 words. B. GOING HOME An Iranian-American
woman returns and discovers a Teheran full of contradictions. In
``To See and See Again : A Life in Iran and America,'' Tara
Bahrampour has written a fascinating, often moving, account of her
life on the boundary between two very different cultures. Review by
Adrienne Edgar. 1,500 words.

   A. HIGH-TECH UNDERWATER TOOLS YIELD CLUES TO DISASTERS AT SEA
Since the sinking in 1980 of the bulk carrier ``Derbyshire,'' a
star of the British merchant fleet, the sea has claimed 180 ships
of similar design and 1,465 lives. The vessels go at a rate of
nearly one a month, often mysteriously, like a fleet of Titanics
quietly disappearing from view. Advanced technology is now allowing
investigators to peer deep into the sea's icy darkness,
illuminating much that was once lost or hidden. By William J.
Broad. 2,300 words + graphic. B. CHEMISTS CREATE FOAM TO FIGHT
NERVE GASES By combining ingredients of hair-conditioning creams
and toothpaste, a new foam could neutralize many of the chemical
poisons and disease-causing microbes that might be spread by
terrorists in confined spaces. By Malcolm W. Browne. 580 words.

 WHEN GOOD MOMS GET MAD

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of my worst moments as a mother. I had just gotten
back from a harrowing trip to the food store and was staggering
into the house with groceries in one arm and a screaming
18-month-old in the other. For the millionth time that morning, my
5-year-old was demanding to know when I'd help him build his Lego
fort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play after I make lunch,'' I said sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you promised you'd do it when we got home,'' Gus whined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will, but later,'' I replied as I wrestled Teddy into his
highchair. ``Can't you see I'm busy?'' I hissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always busy,'' he spat back. ``And you're a big, fat
liar, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a what?'' I yelled. Normally, I can ignore that kind of
remark. But on that day, I snapped. All the frustration I'd been
holding in burst forth as fury at Gus's disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   I grabbed him, hustled him into his bedroom and held the door
shut so I wouldn't do what I really felt like doing, which was to
slap him. My heart was racing, my hands were shaking, and all I
could think was: Why did I ever have kids?
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, after everyone had eaten lunch and calmed down, I
looked at my two beautiful children and wondered how I could ever
have been so angry when I loved them so much. I felt guilty and
ashamed_and I was certain that I was the worst mother in the world.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, I'm simply normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers are as capable as anyone of feeling anger, aggression
or ambivalence, and they often feel it toward their own children or
project it onto them,'' reports Meg Eastman, the author of ``Taming
the Dragon in Your Child: Solutions for Breaking the Cycle of
Family Anger'' (Wiley, $5.99).
</P>
<P>
   But even if it is normal, maternal anger can be hard to handle.
``Many women don't feel comfortable with anger to begin with,''
says Dr. Deena Harris, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry
at Columbia University in New York City. ``So when they feel it
toward their own child_the person they most expect to love and
protect_it seems frightening and unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, maternal anger is often denied and rarely
discussed. ``But ignoring anger doesn't make it go away,'' says
June Price Tangney, professor of psychology at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va. ``It only sends it underground for a
while. Eventually, it resurfaces in less direct and often more
destructive behaviors like shaming, blaming and making hostile
remarks, for instance, or nagging and creating power struggles.''
</P>
<P>
   If we turn anger inward, it can lead to guilt, anxiety, and
depression. In extreme cases, it can lead to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far better to acknowledge maternal anger and face it
head-on,'' says Tangney. ``The feeling itself is inevitable,'' she
adds. ``It's what you do with it that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What Makes Mom See Red &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Understanding why you get angry is an important step in coping
with this disturbing emotion. Every mother has her own hot buttons,
of course. But there are certain aspects of motherhood that can
ignite fury across the board.
</P>
<P>
   One is the sheer strain of caring for children. ``No matter how
much a woman loves her child,'' says Harris, ``she's bound to
resent always having to be there to meet his or her needs''_to
nurse a baby around the clock, for instance, or comfort a colicky
infant; to change wet sheets at 2 a.m. or spend every Saturday
morning on a soccer field instead of sleeping in.
</P>
<P>
   We also have moments when we wish our kids were different:
smarter or braver, quieter or more aggressive, outgoing instead of
shy, more (or less) like us.
</P>
<P>
   These, too, can fuel the maternal fires. Harris observes,
``There's a lot of identification and expectation involved in the
parent-child relationship. You give more to a child, so you expect
more back. That leaves a lot of room for disappointment and anger_
like when your child throws a tantrum in the supermarket or is rude
to his grandmother, or when he's afraid to go near the water (and
swimming is your favorite sport).
</P>
<P>
   The impulse to lash out at a child_either physically or
verbally_is hard to resist when all I you can see is red. And,
based on the statistics for child abuse and neglect (some 3 million
cases were reported in 1997), many parents do not resist the
impulse. They use excessive force to discipline or use their kids
as punching bags to relieve their own stress and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   One day, I found myself thinking that if I gave him a good
spanking he'd probably shut up. I was so shocked and horrified by
this thought that I immediately went to hug him instead.
</P>
<P>
   Many women are so appalled or frightened by their anger that
they immediately repress it, says Harris. But rage always finds a
way to surface. For instance, you may end up exploding over a minor
mishap (such as spilled juice) when you're really angry about a
bigger issue (the fact that your child ruined a family outing by
whining all day). Or you may begin to act in a controlling manner
(insisting your child wear only the clothes that you choose).
</P>
<P>
   There are variations, but the result is the same: ``It eats away
at a child's self-esteem,'' says Tangney. ``When your anger comes
out in hostile remarks or aggressive actions, your child can sense
that something's up. But she may jump to the wrong conclusions:
that there's something wrong with her, or you don't love her, or
she's a bad person.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cool-Down Strategies &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to deal with maternal anger. Here are some proven
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Acknowledge your anger. When ambivalence or anger clouds your
motherly devotion, try to accept it for what it is_a normal
feeling. Remind yourself that even good mothers get mad, and try to
pinpoint the true source of your negative feelings. Is your child
really out of line, or is there a bigger issue involved?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you understand how your anger relates to your child, it
becomes far more manageable,'' says Harris. Rather than blindly
lashing out, you can focus on finding solutions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find support. ``The best relief for maternal anger is talking
with other others who feel the way you do,'' says Dr. Harris. Do
whatever you can to avoid feeling isolated: Organize playdates,
join a support group through your church or YMCA, start a mothers'
group. If you can't find another mother to commiserate with, find a
relative, friend, or counselor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't set impossible standards for yourself. Forget about
being the perfect mother. Instead, be the best parent you can be.
If that means not putting out a huge spread for Thanksgiving like
your mother did, or letting your cleaning standards slip, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't slow down for yourself, do it for your
children,'' Tangney advises. After all, you're their main role
model of what a mother should be.

<P>
   One by one, seven performers grasp a trapeze bar and swing down
over a stage that is so high-tech its trampolines are hidden under
a remote-controlled, sliding floor.
</P>
<P>
   The pale-pink outfits the artists wear during this training
exercise only hint at the color, dash and artistry of the show at
the Cirque du Soleil's new theater at Downtown Disney's West Side
in Orlando, Fla. The spectacular building, which opened in
December, is Cirque du Soleil's only permanent, free-standing
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the structure as just a theater is a little like
calling a $400,000 Ferrari just a car.
</P>
<P>
   With an exterior built to emulate a circus big top, and an oval
stage with wraparound seating so close performers could leap into a
front-row lap, the new building feels like a prototype of
Broadway's future.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Cirque du Soleil is no ordinary circus. The production
blends acrobatic and aerial performers with colorful lighting,
striking costumes and original music ranging from rock'n'roll to
opera. No animals. No sawdust. What emerges from the circus
makeover has many of the elements of theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skeleton of what we have is acrobatic,'' says Gilles
Ste-Croix, Cirque du Soleil's director of creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the presentation and design, including the choreography,
the music, the costume and the proper setting for each piece, uses
a much more theatrical approach to create dramatization.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the proper lighting and proper approach, you really can
touch people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Ste-Croix was part of a French Canadian group of street
performers that delighted crowds with juggling, fire eating and
walking on stilts (Ste-Croix's specialty).
</P>
<P>
   From their beginnings in Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, they formed a
traveling entertainers festival which debuted in 1984 as Cirque du
Soleil, French for ``Circus of the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Like traditional circuses, Cirque du Soleil originally roamed
with its own big-top _ which added another element to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were street players, we were acrobatic and not
using any animals in what we did,'' Ste-Croix says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And moving into a big top... we basically brought this to a
level of theatrical experience. Suddenly, because of the tent, we
could do black (dark lighting ambience), we could do light, and we
could do dramatic music.''
</P>
<P>
   Another pivotal step came in 1993, when Cirque du Soleil began
performing in theaters including a custom-designed one for a
continuing show in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a challenge, because we had been working in a
big top ever since 1984 and suddenly we were going into a
theater,'' Ste-Croix says.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we tried to project what we had in the big top, with the
public around a central stage, adding the backing and all the
elements of a theatrical building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibilities of lights, trap doors, rising floors and
other elements bring a greater experience, because under a big top
you cannot have all these,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, it brought even further, the theatrical experience we're
trying to create.''
</P>
<P>
   At its new home in Orlando, Cirque du Soleil follows the same
approach seen in touring productions in Europe, Asia and North
America, and in the continuing performances in Las Vegas _ but with
all new acts.
</P>
<P>
   And like each of its preceding productions, Cirque du Soleil's
newest show has its own name, ``La Nouba,'' which means ``to party,
to live it up,'' in French.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute show features more than 60 performers, including
the seven trapeze artists from Russia, and other performers from
Europe, China, Canada, the United States and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Training and rehearsals use up to five languages through
interpreters _ French, English, Chinese, Russian and Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bilodeau, a French Canadian who has performed for Cirque
du Soleil since 1990, teams up with his twin brother Stacy for a
performance on what is called the ``German wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfitted in a body suit like a Navy SEAL who ran away and
joined the circus, the 22-year-old Bilodeau will fit himself into a
6 1/2-foot-diameter steel wheel to gyrate and roll around the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Nouba,'' like other Cirque shows, is very loosely scripted,
meaning performers are free _ if not encouraged _ to ``experiment''
with their act and discover what works best with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, we were working on the wheel and there is a lot of
fire,'' Bilodeau says. ``And the stage is moving, so you can go on
stage and basically do whatever you want. And the director will say
'OK, I like it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So the show changes every day.''
</P>
<P>
   For Igor Arefiev, a Russian high-wire walker who has worked with
both the Moscow Circus and the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey
Circus, performing with Cirque du Soleil offers a literal breath of
fresh air to a seasoned performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other circuses were traditional ones, and they bring in
mostly kids, with elephants and clowns,'' says Arefiev, 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's all I saw for four years: couples and four or five
kids with them. But here, it's more modern and for grown-ups. And
the show itself is more elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I performed before, it was just me, my partner and the
audience. But here, there are (other performers) above me, below me
and all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you have to communicate with them, and not just
concentrate on crossing the wire.''

 &HT;    Southern folk artist Lonnie Holley at a crossroads
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARPERSVILLE, Ala. _ A dozen vehicles squat in the yard, but
none of them work. There are bedpans and televisions, and piles of
plywood and stands of Styrofoam, and nylon mesh flapping in the
breeze and cats brushing between the rusty legs of discarded lawn
chairs. If you didn't know this was a folk art environment, you'd
swear it was a trailer park after a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never take anything to the junkyard,'' Lonnie Holley says,
gesturing at the clutter that threatens to engulf him.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important figures in Southern folk art, Holley
started his career 20 years ago by carving the soft sandstone that
steel mills use as molds. Since then, he's led so many workshops at
schools and churches that children around Birmingham know him as
the Sandman.
</P>
<P>
   He wonders what the children would think now.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rainy Tuesday afternoon in December. Holley heard a
commotion downstairs. He hurried down the steps. Voices were
shouting. ``Get down!'' It was the police. ``Get down now!'' They
ordered him to the floor, face down on the living room carpet, and
clamped handcuffs around his wrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this some kind of a joke?'' Holley asked.
</P>
<P>
   It was no joke. He was under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Holley has known a world of trouble in his 49 years. He
has been beaten, shot, jailed. He has been abandoned, cheated,
stolen from. He has watched as his home of 18 years _ along with
much of the art and debris he carefully placed around it _ was
bulldozed into a trench to make way for an airport expansion. But
nothing in a life of Job-like tribulations has prepared him for the
misfortunes of the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   Holley is credited with creating some of the most sophisticated,
conceptual work in Southern folk art. Museums and galleries from
New York to Japan have displayed his paintings, sandstone carvings
and assemblages. His vision burned brightly during the 1996
Olympics, when a re-creation of his art-bedazzled yard formed the
focal point of ``Souls Grown Deep,'' a major folk art exhibition in
Atlanta. Newsweek magazine judged it the best part of the Olympic
Arts Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Given the praise and publicity, this should be the best of times
for Holley. Instead, he finds himself spending more time talking to
lawyers and judges than making art.
</P>
<P>
   First he was uprooted from his Birmingham home in a tortuous
condemnation proceeding that dragged on for five years. Then, after
he moved to the small town of Harpersville, 25 miles away, his new
neighbors feuded with his family, one of them going so far as to
assault him, police say. Finally, on Dec. 8, he and his three sons
_ Ezekial, Kubra and A.J. _ were arrested in connection with a
burglary and arson at a golf course behind their house.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Holley is broke.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Holley first heard he was going to have to move in 1992.
Birmingham International Airport wanted to extend a runway, and the
project would require buying and demolishing hundreds of homes in
the predominantly black, low-income neighborhood of Airport Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The airport authority offered Holley $14,000 for his acre of
land. But his acre was nothing like the others. While his house was
crude, his yard contained thousands of pieces of art that seemed to
be as rooted in the soil as the trees.
</P>
<P>
   But one by one, the surrounding homes vanished as his neighbors
accepted resettlement checks. And the bulldozers crept closer.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was one house _ Holley's. The artist was trapped.
He knew he would have to leave, but he couldn't afford to buy
another home until the airport offered him more money. In 1995,
Joseph Strickland, a Birmingham probate attorney, volunteered to
represent him. He enlisted a litigator friend of his, Frank
Galloway, and they negotiated for two years. In October 1997, with
a trial date looming, the authority finally agreed to pay Holley
$165,700 _ more than two-thirds of it for the estimated cost of
relocating his environment to a new home in Harpersville.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers thought he had no chance of getting a mortgage loan,
with his erratic earnings, so he paid $91,500 cash.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Holley's new neighbors did not want him there.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Jews, the woman who had lived in the house for years, lost
the property in 1996 and was still enraged. One night shortly after
Holley moved in, he says, she burst into the house and his bedroom
demanding that he vacate the premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know who you are!'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   His new home was a fragile egg in a nest of resentment. The
woman's family lived near Holley's new house, and none of the kin
was pleased to see trucks dumping piles of rubbish and peculiar art
on what had been their relative's neatly mowed lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The bad feelings boiled over in a dispute over a small building
just within Holley's property. The Garretts use it as a sort of
juke joint. Holley's oldest son, 18-year-old Ezekial, wanted to set
up a silk-screen T-shirt shop in the building, but the Garretts
refused to surrender it.
</P>
<P>
   One day last summer, Ezekial got into a fistfight with Maurice
Garrett, the 28-year-old nephew of the woman who used to own their
house.
</P>
<P>
   The feud quickly turned violent. Someone opened fire with a
rifle. Ezekial ran into his house, and he and his brothers starting
firing back with a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only Maurice Garrett was charged in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ____
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, in the midst of such troubles, Holley managed to make
enough paintings and sculptures for a show of his work last fall.
The pieces, priced from $170 to $5,000, sold reasonably well and
provided virtually his only income for 1998. The remaining works
are still on display at the Monty Stabler Galleries, a posh salon
in the upscale Birmingham suburb of Homewood.
</P>
<P>
   As she flips through the paintings _ all of them on paper _
Stabler wishes she had more on canvas, but knows why she doesn't.
``Lonnie works on what he can afford,'' she says. ``He can't afford
canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   The perpetually struggling artist is a figure as old as clay.
Perhaps nowhere in the art world is the stereotype more fitting
than in the realm of folk art.
</P>
<P>
   As folk art has grown more popular during the 1980s and '90s, a
few artists have fared well _ Georgia's Howard Finster and
Alabama's Thornton Dial, for example. But most remained poor or
close to it.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Holley's patronage has come from one man, Atlanta
collector Bill Arnett, a bespectacled 59-year-old whose combative
personality and zealous pursuit of folk art have made him one of
the most controversial names in the field. Arnett first beheld
Holley's environment in 1986 and was so moved that he agreed to
advance the artist a regular income in exchange for the right of
first refusal on his symbolic assemblages.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Holley's money problems go deep. Some galleries
have found the logistics of dealing with him too taxing. Others
have found Holley's art difficult to sell.
</P>
<P>
   There's one other reason for Holley's money woes. Almost
everyone who knows him believes he can be too generous for his own
good.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Holley has asked acquaintances in the art world if
they would assist him in managing his affairs. This winter, as
Holley's life scraped bottom, the lawyers who represented him in
his airport battle found a new recruit.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lasseter, an owlish Birmingham furniture maker who has
known Holley for a few years, read about his arrest in the December
golf course burglary and drove to Harpersville to see whether the
family had enough food. He ended up delivering considerably more
than dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lonnie is one of the most decent people I've ever met,''
Lasseter says. ``I'm doing everything I can to ease his mind and
let him get back to his art. People have taken advantage of him.
I'm just trying to stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   ____
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Dec. 8, the superintendent at the Meadows, the
golf course in Holley's neighborhood, arrived for work before dawn
to find the clubhouse burned down. Police followed muddy golf cart
tracks as they led back to Holley's property and, ultimately, to
his three teen-age sons.
</P>
<P>
   And then the tracks turned on Holley himself.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged with receiving stolen property: golf shirts,
liquor, walkie-talkies and other items deputies found inside his
house. His oldest son is accused of stealing the goods the night
before, with help from his two younger brothers, and then burning
down the clubhouse in a clumsy attempt to conceal the burglary.
Holley says he was asleep when it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the cruelest aspect of Holley's current predicament is
the knowledge that his children got him into it.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking posed a problem after Holley and his estranged wife,
Carolyn, broke up, but instead of continuing the pattern, Holley
sobered up, he says. He took his children to the Holiness church.
He insisted they attend school. He taught them how to draw and
sculpt, and carried them to art fairs so they could sell their work
and buy shoes and clothes with the money. Angela, the firstborn,
kept records of her father's artwork. Ezekial, the oldest son,
liked to paint. Kubra (pronounced coo-BAR) took to carving, while
little brother Arthur James gravitated toward music. Carlonie, the
kid sister, won a blue ribbon at school for a painting that she
said was about ``women who forget to take care of their children.''
They were handsome youngsters, growing tall and lean like their
daddy, and people were impressed with their polite manners and
creative potential.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 8, a juvenile judge warned Holley that if he wanted
to keep his children, their truancy had to stop.
</P>
<P>
   If Holley does not seem furious with his children, perhaps it is
because he understands their frustrations. ``I got angry with Zeke
when he stole the car. I got angry with Angela when she got
pregnant at 16 and dropped out of school. But I'm not in that angry
mood now,'' he says. ``My children have been through so much. I
think what happened in December, they were getting back at the
community. It was like they were saying, `Daddy, we need to get out
of here.' They were running away from the hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Elbert Buckelew, the Meadows majority owner, estimates the
clubhouse damage at more than $100,000. ``We were robbed _ I don't
have a problem with that,'' he says. ``But, dammit, why'd they have
to burn it down? I don't care if he's a damn Picasso, he's got to
be responsible for his kids.''
</P>
<P>
   To recover his losses, Buckelew is considering suing Holley
under an Alabama law that holds parents accountable for the actions
of their children. ``I find it hard to fathom that he didn't know
something about what his sons were doing,'' he says. ``We need to
see if he was involved in any way. Because if he was, he needs to
lose all that.''
</P>
<P>
   He means Holley's property, the only home he's got, the only
thing of tangible value that he has to show for 20 years of making
art and raising a family against the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all I've been through, I don't need to be losing this,''
Holley says. ``If I lose this ...''
</P>
<P>
   He draws a deep breath and falls silent. He cannot bear to
finish the thought.
</P>
<P>
   ____
</P>
<P>
   At 49, Holley has conducted hundreds of workshops over the
years. On the last Thursday in February, he conducted one that must
have been his most heartfelt. It was for teen-agers at the Shelby
County Regional Juvenile Detention Facility in Columbiana. One of
them, locked up since December, was his son Kubra.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children are artists,'' he says, ``not criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   As winter warms to spring, this cold passage in Holley's life is
beginning to show the first signs of thaw. The dispute with his
neighbors seems to be diminishing; they finally agreed to pay him
rent for the building they have been using as a juke joint. And the
golf course may not sue after all, because prosecutors hope to make
any plea bargains contingent on some restitution. The payments
would be hard to make, but at least Holley could keep his home.
</P>
<P>
   Life is returning to normal for three of his children. Carlonie,
the 12-year-old, is attending her sixth-grade classes more
faithfully. Angela, 20, plans to work on her high school
equivalency degree as she raises her infant son and 3-year-old
daughter at her father's house. A.J., the youngest son, was
released from the transitional juvenile home where he spent most of
the winter. The high-spirited 13-year-old was sentenced to
probation and community service, and has resumed the seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the oldest sons, Ezekial and Kubra, who have always
assumed that they would become artists like their father.
</P>
<P>
   Ezekial is the quiet one. At 18, he seems to carry a chip on his
shoulder from all the troubles he has seen befall his family. ``I
still want to follow in my father's footsteps,'' he said,
mentioning his interest in drawing and silk-screen printing, ``but
I've just had some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubra is the outgoing one. The juvenile authorities were so
taken with Kubra that they nominated him for the Alabama School of
Fine Arts, a magnet program in Birmingham for gifted children from
throughout the state. When he was accepted, he asked his teacher if
she could help him with a subject he needed to know more about. Not
art. Math.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the creative flame has continued to burn within
Holley. The uprooting, the shooting, the arrests _ like the clutter
in his yard, the pieces of his life are so many materials for art.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Holley finally got his hands on some spare cash
and asked a friend to drive him to the nearest Wal-Mart. He bought
$50 worth of generic house paint and set up the cans on a table in
his living room, across from the framed picture of him and Hillary
Clinton at the White House, during the exhibition that featured a
piece of his sculpture. In the same room, 10 weeks before, police
had handcuffed him and taken him to the county jail.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time in months, Holley dipped a brush into a
can and began to paint.

 &HT;    Texas rookie judge courts political future
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It didn't take Ernest Garcia long to learn that
even rookie judges sometimes get treated like rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed by Gov. George W. Bush to fill the Travis County
judicial vacancy left by Joe Hart, Garcia was participating in a
game of musical courtrooms almost as soon as he put his hand down
from taking the oath. District Judge Suzanne Covington moved into
Hart's old courtroom _ with its prime location on the third floor
of the courthouse _ and Garcia wound up with a decent enough
courtroom, but a tiny office.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter the size of his office, Garcia shrugged while
recounting the opening episode of his judgeship. It doesn't matter,
he explained, because he'll be spending most of his time in the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   And when he's not in the courtroom, he'll be working on
retaining the judgeship. While Republicans are gaining ground in
Travis County, Democrats are hanging tough at the courthouse.
Republicans mounted several spirited and well-financed challenges
to county Democrats and picked up only one county commissioner
seat. That was Precinct 3 (South and Southwest Travis County), won
by Todd Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   Will Wilson was the only other Republican who has held a
district judgeship in Travis County in recent history. Appointed by
Gov. Bill Clements in 1989, Wilson lost a hard-fought general
election campaign to John Dietz.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional courthouse wisdom is that a similar fate awaits
Garcia. But if you ask him, he'll tell you that he's going to work
hard to hang on to the job.
</P>
<P>
   The son of working-class parents from Corpus Christi, Garcia is
a former federal prosecutor who got his law degree from the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He had not been very visible in local politics before the
governor tapped him to succeed the highly respected Hart. While
some may consider the political inexperience a drawback, it could
also be a blessing. He hasn't made that many enemies and he's
obviously made one friend who counts _ the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Visit with Garcia, though, and you're in the company of a fellow
who is obviously intelligent, and one who is working hard to
develop a political persona. It's not easy, he admits. What he will
find toughest, he said, is raising money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger and they passed out a box of candy bars to
sell at school, I couldn't stomach the thought of going door to
door and asking strangers for money. So, my grandmother would buy
the box and I would eat most of it,'' he related, then joked,
``that's why I have the physique I do today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly not a professional politician and I'll never be
comfortable raising money, but I'm going to have to do it,'' Garcia
said.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a good way to pick a judge?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he replied. ``Unfortunately, judges have to run in a
partisan election. It is my opinion that a judge's role is to
interpret the law that is there. Whatever philosophy I may have
shouldn't have a role.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as judges are elected, however, campaigning and raising
money will be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The apathy that greets judicial races is widely known, but
proposals to change the system never suffer from a lack of critics.
</P>
<P>
   And Garcia's view is most realistic: ``I'm certainly not in a
position to change things.''
</P>
<P>
   What he can do, he said, is preside over a courtroom where
people are treated fairly and where the law the Legislature enacted
is applied.
</P>
<P>
   How the judge fares politically between now and the time he
faces the voters remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Garcia, no relation to the judge, is the editorial page
editor of the Austin American-Statesman.

 &HT;    If governor leaves town (or job), who takes over in his absence?
 &HT;    Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Did you know that Rick Perry, the Republican
lieutenant governor and presiding officer of the Texas Senate, is
also governor?
</P>
<P>
   Not always, to be sure. But under the Texas Constitution, when
Gov. George W. Bush is out of the state, Perry is acting governor,
while continuing in his role as lieutenant governor. With Bush
running for president, that could happen a lot.
</P>
<P>
   What if Bush is elected president in 2000? At least some who
read the Texas Constitution say it leaves the possibility that
Perry could continue in that dual status of lieutenant governor and
acting governor.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Tom Ramsay (D-Mount Vernon) is concerned enough about
that possibility that he wants to clarify it. The Northeast Texas
representative has filed a proposed constitutional amendment that
was heard in the House State Affairs Committee on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay said Texas has never known that a governor was likely to
leave office early while officials still had time to deal with
questions about succession and duties. ``We thought it would be a
good idea to make it clear,'' Ramsay said.
</P>
<P>
   The last gubernatorial vacancy was in 1949, when then-Gov.
Beauford Jester died. The lieutenant governor, Allan Shivers,
vacated that office by taking the oath as governor.
</P>
<P>
   But it is possible, some constitutional observers say, that
Perry could continue as the Senate's presiding officer and still be
acting governor if he simply avoided being sworn in as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay's proposal, House Joint Resolution 44, flatly states that
if the governor leaves office, the lieutenant governor becomes
governor.
</P>
<P>
   His proposed amendment also would make an important change in
the line of succession into the lieutenant governorship. Currently,
senators would select a colleague who would become lieutenant
governor while continuing to serve as a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay thinks, and others agree, that whichever senator is
selected ought to be lieutenant governor and only that.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1984, if the lieutenant governor's office became vacant,
the president pro tempore of the Senate would become acting
lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate developed a habit of passing around the president
pro tem job to the most senior senator who hadn't yet held it, so
the senator could hold a ``governor for a day'' celebration at the
Capitol for supporters and others. The governor and lieutenant
governor would dutifully leave the state, or say they were leaving,
so the president pro tem could be acting governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, some of the more conservative senators began
to worry that someone _ especially a more liberal senator _ might
be president pro tem when both the governor and lieutenant governor
vacated office, through death or other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1983, then-Sen. Grant Jones, a conservative Democrat from
Abilene, got the Legislature to approve a constitutional amendment,
which Texas voters endorsed in 1984. It said if the lieutenant
governor's job becomes vacant, senators would come into session and
choose an acting lieutenant governor. It calls for senators to
select someone from among themselves ``to perform the duties of the
Lieutenant Governor in addition to his duties as Senator until the
next general election.'' So the Ramsay proposal says that when the
senator becomes lieutenant governor, his or her senate seat becomes
vacant and will be filled by special election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not political,'' Ramsay said. ``It's not partisan. I've
talked to both Republicans and Democrats in the House, and they
don't have any problems with it. There's widespread support in the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay said that the proposed rewrite of the Texas Constitution,
offered by Sen. Bill Ratliff (R-Mount Pleasant) and Rep. Rob Junell
(D-San Angelo), calls for the same clear succession arrangement,
although in slightly different words.
</P>
<P>
   But at Monday's committee hearing, several questions were
raised:
</P>
<P>
   _ Are the state's best interests served by having the senator
who acts as lieutenant governor quit the Senate seat?
</P>
<P>
   _ Should the new lieutenant governor/senator serve the remainder
of the governor's term, or just until the next election?
</P>
<P>
   _ If Bush is elected president, could an early resignation as
governor mean Perry's successor as lieutenant governor would be
chosen by the current Senate (which has 16 Republicans and 15
Democrats), but preside over the 2001 Senate (which could have a
Democratic majority)?
</P>
<P>
   How those questions are resolved may determine whether the
proposal gets the two-thirds vote necessary in the House and Senate
to be put before voters in November.

 &HT;    Teachers' battle scars worse when brass won't back them up
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Everybody knows, said everybody, that schools are
awash in violence.
</P>
<P>
   So when Horace Mann Insurance Corp. made news last year with
``assault recovery'' insurance for school personnel, everyone could
see policies selling like curly fries.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone except teachers.
</P>
<P>
   As of year's end, though available in 45 states, only about 300
policies had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Several theories: First, teachers can't afford it, even with
modest premiums of $4 a month. Second, falsely or not, some believe
themselves sufficiently insured against injury on the job through
workers compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Third, it's safe to say that most teachers don't look at their
students as the greatest threat to them.
</P>
<P>
   They think of students' parents, with attorneys at their elbows,
as that threat, and spineless administrators as No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers have a cop's mentality. They expect to step into fights
and expose themselves to cuts and scrapes. They expect to have
problem children explode in their faces. They expect the drill of
hauling a chronic brawler down the hall while the child bites at
your wrists.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't expect is to have the little brawler-mauler back
in class before the next potty break.
</P>
<P>
   They don't expect school districts to make mince meat of their
own zero-tolerance discipline policies because Johnny, into double
digits with his demerits (three is the expressed limit in Waco
schools), is judged a ``special needs'' child, meaning that
``zero'' computes as ``infinite,'' tolerance-wise.
</P>
<P>
   This was some of the frustration that bubbled forth in Austin
when teachers rallied on behalf of a bill called the Classroom
Discipline Act.
</P>
<P>
   The act, carried in the Senate by Houston Democrat John Whitmire
and in the House by Rep. Rick Noriega (D-Houston), would give force
of law to discipline techniques once considered sacrosanct.
</P>
<P>
   Protected under this act: teachers' authority to ``verbally
discipline'' a student; to physically isolate a student in the
classroom; to withhold classroom privileges; and to use ``a
physically harmless prop in disciplining a student.'' Yes, like a
dunce cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean to say,'' everyone will say, ``teachers can't do that
now?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes they can, by and large. But they know that school districts
quake at the sight of parents bearing lawyers, and that sometimes
principals will succumb to a lobbying Ma and Pa insisting that
their Precious was unfairly singled out, humiliated and
life-scarred by a stern teacher.
</P>
<P>
   One can see problems with legislation of this sort. If a teacher
goes off the deep end with an abusive, window-shattering rant, is
it protected as ``verbal discipline''? Is an ankle chained to a
tetherball poll the use of ``harmless prop''? What about when a
teacher truly and cruelly singles a kid out?
</P>
<P>
   But one can see more benefits than problems were the state to
provide backup for teachers on discipline matters when
administrators won't.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Texas Association of School Boards and
Texas Association of School Administrators oppose this.
</P>
<P>
   School districts ``already have the authority to do all of this
right now,'' said the administrators group. Yes, they do. But ask
teachers and find they too often feel that their hands, raw from
being gnawed, can be tied in trying to control things.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation runs counter to the ``local control'' mantra
lawmakers spout but rarely honor (see Texas Assessment of Academic
Skills). Whitmire says local control is fine, but his bill is the
backup teachers need. ``The bottom line is they're (administrators)
afraid of parents. They're afraid of lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator sounds like a teacher.

 &HT;    `Veteran widow's' advice indispensable for women
 &HT;    By Teresa K. Weaver
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two decades after the death of her husband, Philomene
Gates, an 80-year-old New York lawyer, considers herself ``a
veteran widow,'' but she's quick to admit she still hasn't gotten
over the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get over your husband's death,'' she says. ``You get
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was March 1979 when her husband of 38 years, Sam, died of a
ruptured aneurysm, and Gates was struck with one undeniable
consequence: For the first time in her life, she lived alone. The
minutiae of daily life _ paying bills, finding health insurance,
handling home repairs _ seemed overwhelming. Soon, though, the
practical instincts of an urbane attorney kicked in, and Gates
started coping with everyday life, jotting down notes along the
way. The result was a self-help book called ``Suddenly Alone: A
Woman's Guide to Widowhood.'' Now, the book has been expanded to
include divorce, and the tireless Gates _ ``You rest, you rust'' _
is on a quick book tour. Shortly after flying into Atlanta from
Miami, she took a few minutes to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What prompted you to write this book?
</P>
<P>
   A: After Sam's death, my three wonderful daughters kept saying,
``Mother, you're doing so well.'' I certainly didn't feel like I
was doing well _ I was trembling inside so badly I was afraid of
falling down ... but I kept up the appearance of doing well. One
daughter suggested that I start keeping notes of all the problems I
encountered as they arose, so I could tell other women in the same
situation what to expect. ... It's a very practical book.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the best piece of advice women can take from your
book?
</P>
<P>
   A: Be sure you know who's in control of your life, meaning your
money. Really, women need to read this kind of book before anything
happens to their husband, whether it's death or divorce. Ask
questions: What do we own? What do we owe? If you walk out of here
and a truck hits you, what am I supposed to do? What do you want to
happen to the children?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Don't women tend to do that more today than they did 20 years
ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: Younger women tend to do that more, but, you know, people
really don't like to talk about these things. And a lot of men feel
threatened if their wives start asking these kinds of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What surprised you most about living alone?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was suddenly not being invited to parties that I know I
would have been invited to if Sam were alive. ... An extra woman is
a problem. I think that's less so for younger couples. I don't
think my daughters are so hooked on the ``balanced'' table at
dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are some real pluses to living alone: You don't
have to ask anybody's permission to do anything, you get the icebox
all to yourself, and you have time to do the things that really put
a charge in your life _ reading, joining a book club, gardening.
... Anything that will give you more confidence is to the good.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In your book, one of your rules is, ``Don't whine.'' Why is
that so important?
</P>
<P>
   A: You have to want to be happy. If you run into somebody who
asks how you're doing and you say, ``Oh, I'm so unhappy,'' the next
time they see you in the supermarket they're going to run the other
way.
</P>
<P>
   You have to discover what makes you happy and do that. It's also
really important to do volunteer work. I never would have survived
Sam's death if I hadn't volunteered. The friends I made through
volunteering got me through. If I had had to depend on my working
friends for my social life, I'd still be sitting in a corner.

 &HT;    `Jew Store' honest account of small-town South
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The title of her book, ``The Jew Store,'' may be
off-putting to some, but Stella Suberman has never worried about
political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tell the truth like it is, and that's what everybody
used to call these stores in small towns in the South,'' says
Suberman, 77. ``They were places where farmhands, sharecroppers and
factory workers could buy inexpensive clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jew Store'' (Algonquin Books, $19.95) is Suberman's richly
detailed memoir about growing up in the only Jewish family in a
small Tennessee town she calls Concordia (she changed the names of
the people and the town to protect privacy). It was here that
Suberman's Russian immigrant father, Aaron Bronson, opened
Bronson's Low-Priced Store in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Jews came South, they loved it,'' says Suberman, who
lives in Boca Raton, Fla., and writes book reviews for The Miami
Herald. ``Many of them had come from very tiny villages in the old
country, and the South in many ways was more like home'' than the
North was.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean there was no prejudice in 1920s Tennessee. The
Ku Klux Klan would open their meetings by vowing to protect ``the
good white citizens'' of the town from Roman Catholics, Jews and
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Suberman says, laughing, ``then they would do
their shopping at Father's store.''
</P>
<P>
   Suberman's father became a hero in 1929 when the stock market
crashed and the shoe factory in town was about to shut down because
it could not pay a $45,000 loan. In a dramatic recounting of a
meeting between the factory owner and the townspeople, Suberman
describes how her father leaped onto the stage and offered to
donate $5,000. Then he began calling people by name and challenging
them to give money, too. As a result of his efforts, the factory _
and the town _ were saved.

   Although the family moved to New York in 1933 and then to
Florida, Suberman says they always regarded Concordia as home.

   ``I went back to visit after I wrote the book,'' she says.
``Very little has changed. Our house is still there, but the large

<P>
   _ Literary awards: Congressman John Lewis' civil rights memoir,
``Walking With the Wind,'' former President Jimmy Carter's essays
on ``The Virtues of Aging'' and Phyllis Alesia Perry's novel
``Stigmata'' were among the top winners at the recent Georgia
Author of the Year competition in Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said the award couldn't have come at a better time. ``I've
been working on my next novel, `Second Sunday,' and I was feeling a
lot of pressure _ both internal and external. This helped my
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Second Sunday'' is a prequel to ``Stigmata,'' which dealt with
Lizzie, a young black girl who has strange dreams about slavery
after inheriting her grandmother's quilt. Sent to mental
institutions by her parents, Lizzie begins a 20-year journey to
learn about the past that haunts her.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners include Frank Manley for ``The Cockfighter''
(fiction), Barbara Ras for ``Bite Every Sorrow'' (poetry), Muriel
Phillips Joslyn for ``A Meteor Shining Brightly'' (biography),
Lewis Larson for ``The Georgia and South Carolina Expeditions of
Clarence Bloomfield Moore'' (historical), Linton Wright McKnight
for ``Birthflowers of the Landscape'' (nature), Clara Bell Hooks
Eschmann for ``Remember When: Family, Friends, Recipes''
(cookbook), Lynn Cullen for ``The Mightiest Heart'' (children's
picture book), Stan Applegate for ``The Devil's Highway'' (middle
reader division), Brad Strickland for ``The Spectre From the
Magician's Museum'' (young adult) and Sandra Markle for ``Outside
and Inside Alligators'' (children's nonfiction).

<P>
   _ Footnotes: Has the market for ``A Man in Full'' finally been
saturated? Tom Wolfe's hefty saga about race and real estate
dealings in Atlanta slips out of the Top 10 to No. 14 on this
Sunday's New York Times Best Seller List. ... Speaking of Wolfe,
three of the author's books made New York University's list of the
100 greatest works of 20th-century journalism.

 &HT;    Annabel Chong: A woman on a mission
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Bundled in a long red coat, her black hair
lashing in the wind, Grace Quek lights a cigarette and talks about
what it's like to have sex with 251 anonymous men over 10 hours.
Just another day in the life of a porn superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Quek, known better by her nom de coitus, Annabel Chong, is the
star of ``Sex: The Annabel Chong Story,'' Gough Lewis' revealing
but ultimately pathetic chronicle of the issues that surrounded
Chong's record-setting feat of fornication. The documentary caused
a media stir at this year's Sundance Film Festival, and shows today
at the South by Southwest Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Quek earned a graduate degree in gender studies from
the University of Southern California, and her Olympian
sex-tathalon stemmed partly from her quest for gender empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   Quek is 26. She is poised and polite and seems either mildly shy
or vaguely chastened. She wears the patina of someone who is old
beyond her years.
</P>
<P>
   Quek sat on a documentary panel at SXSW on Saturday. I spoke
with her afterward on a chilly, wind-pummeled balcony at the Austin
Convention Center. She tried to smoke in the gales, while I tried
to keep my notes from blowing to El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did you have sex with 251 men?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mostly out of curiosity about myself and what I could enjoy
sexually, how far could I go and still find it fun.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The film ascribes the stunt to your contempt for female
repression and disempowerment. That sounds a little pat.
</P>
<P>
   A: I did it out of a complexity of reasons. A lot of it is
personal and some of it's out of curiosity. I didn't go into it
with this violent political vendetta. I wanted to find out for
myself several things: Is it fun? Is it true the women in porn are
these complete hopeless bimbos who are being exploited? The kind of
picture people paint of the porn industry is such a cartoon, and I
thought, ``It cannot be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were your conclusions?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's a grain of truth in a lot of the criticism of the
industry, such as the fact that some girls aren't terribly bright,
sort of clueless, and they get themselves exploited. But I
discovered it's a business just like any business, and it's the
business of making movies, just that the subject matter is sex.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the film you say you wouldn't regret it if you got AIDS
from the event.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's like a one-of-a-kind experience that's so unique that
it's worth it. I always believe in being responsible for what you
do sexually. So for me to do something like that and not accept the
responsibility over my own body would be stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you going to keep your clothes on while in Austin?
</P>
<P>
   A: In this weather? Hell-o?

   SXSW-CLUBS _ AUSTIN _ SXSW brings to showcase clubs 2 to 3 times
their usual monthly income, a huge difference considering the thin
operating margin of most local clubs. If only the clubs could pack
people in and sell as many drinks year round.... SXSW this year
should find big crowds at Liberty Lunch, likely the last time in
its present location, and the Electric Lounge, which is just trying
to keep its doors open through the festival after being hit with
rent increases. Austin Blues is an example of a new club trying to
get established during the festival. (McLeese, Austin

   LIFETIME-NEXT _ ``What next?'' is a question with much resonance
now at Lifetime, the 15-year-old cable network that ventured into
uncharted territory this season by creating three original series.
But are there enough viewers? That's the question facing Lifetime
now as it decides whether or not to bring each of the series back
for a second season. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   THEMOB-TV _ Everything we know about the mob we learned in a
movie theater. From ``Little Caesar'' (1930) to ``The Godfather''
(1972) to ``GoodFellas'' (1990), movies taught us how to do the
mob: to wisecrack ``you dirty rat'' and ``sleeps with the fishes''
and ``what, the way I speak, it amuses you?'' Mob movies showed us
how to pay tribute, erase somebody execution style (one bullet,
behind the ear), die at a table over a plate of linguini in a white
clam sauce, just like a real made guy. Movies owned the Mafia _
even if the Mafia was rumored to own a little piece of the movies.
Until now. With the mid-season debut of HBO's ``The Sopranos,'' TV
has killed off the mob movie and made it its own. (Jubera, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   NYC TOUR GUIDES _ The only thing spinning faster than the

   TRAVEL-DELIS _ NEW YORK _ On the first day of a Big Apple
vacation with her engineer husband, Jennifer Miller of Athens went
to the famed Carnegie Deli for her first real taste of ``deli.''
The pepperiness of pastrami, the lusciouness of lox, the garlicky
tang of pickles so steeped in brine that they're almost white:
these are treats that clog the heart with cholesterol and joy.
``There's enough meat in those sandwiches for five normal ones _
they make your eyes pop out,'' enthused the schoolteacher. ``To the
folks back home I would say: anything that you thought was a deli
before you came here _ isn't!'' Indeed, New York is not only the
capital of deli _ it is deli, in ways that are mysterious and
profound. A tour of five great ones: Katz's, 2nd Avenue, Barney
Greengrass, Carnegie, Stage. (Hulbert, Atlanta

   TRENDS _ Utility chic is the latest buzzword in fashion circles.
Utility chic looks are comfortable, versatile and oh, so practical
and have emerged as the strongest trend for spring/summer 99. Think
pants and jackets with zippers, drawstring pants, Velcro and hoods.
There's a move on to de-emphasize oranmentation and go with simpler
fashions for the latest transitory lifestyles. It's a case where
less is certainly more. (Walton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   EVENINGWEAR _ The dressing-down themes continues in looks for
parties and After-5 affairs. Call it the ''glamour of comfort,''
which means sportswear separates in cottons and cashmere worn with
over long skirts in taffeta or jersey fabrics. Also think two piece
outfits instead of a single long gown. (Johnson, Atlanta

   COXNET _ BOOKS 0319: ``All Too Human,'' the awkward title of the
new memoir by President Clinton's former adviser, George
Stephanopoulos, seems meant as a commentary on the author's
famously flawed former boss and on the author himself. The book
depicts Clinton as a man of contradictions, a politician whose very
``shamelessness is a key to his political success.'' (Kakutani,
N.Y. Times News Service)

   REVIEW _ It is difficult not to pity the characters in Lois-Ann
Yamanaka's novel ``Heads by Harry.'' At first glance they all

   BOOKS-WIDOWHOOD _ When Philomene Gates' husband of 38 years died
suddenly in March 1979, the 60-year-old New York attorney lost
``the comfort of being half a couple in a couples society.'' In
1990, she wrote a book called ``Suddenly Alone: A Woman's Guide to
Widowhood,'' sharing some of her hard-learned ways of surviving and
thriving as a single. Now the book has been expanded and updated,
with new chapters on divorce and loneliness, and the tireless Gates
_ now 80 _ is in Atlanta to sign books and spread her message. A

   BOOK-NOTES _ Some people are put off by the title of Stella
Suberman's book, ``The Jew Store,'' but the Tennessee writer says
that's what folks in the South really called the stores. Suberman's
book captures the mood of an era when almost every small Southern
town had a dry-goods store that was run by Jewish families. Even
Rich's started out small that way. Other notes: Georgia Writers of
the Year named and eight writers, including Don DeLillo and Cynthia
Ozick nominated for the $150,000 Dublin Literary Award _ the
world's richest literary prize. (O'Briant, Atlanta

   BOOKS-HUGHES _ The late British poet laureate Ted Hughes, whose

his work was subsumed by public fascination with his personal life,
particularly his life with Sylvia Plath, who killed herself in
1963, shortly after the two were separated. New material just
acquired by Emory University in the Ted Hughes archive, including
hundreds of personal letters, shows how intimately intertwined the
two poets were, professionally and emotionally, but is also
changing the way Hughes is perceived by critics. (Emerson, Atlanta

   SXSW-CLUBS _ AUSTIN _ SXSW brings to showcase clubs 2 to 3 times
their usual monthly income, a huge difference considering the thin
operating margin of most local clubs. If only the clubs could pack
people in and sell as many drinks year round.... SXSW this year
should find big crowds at Liberty Lunch, likely the last time in
its present location, and the Electric Lounge, which is just trying
to keep its doors open through the festival after being hit with
rent increases. Austin Blues is an example of a new club trying to
get established during the festival. (McLeese, Austin

   LIFETIME-NEXT _ ``What next?'' is a question with much resonance
now at Lifetime, the 15-year-old cable network that ventured into
uncharted territory this season by creating three original series.
But are there enough viewers? That's the question facing Lifetime
now as it decides whether or not to bring each of the series back
for a second season. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   THEMOB-TV _ Everything we know about the mob we learned in a
movie theater. From ``Little Caesar'' (1930) to ``The Godfather''
(1972) to ``GoodFellas'' (1990), movies taught us how to do the
mob: to wisecrack ``you dirty rat'' and ``sleeps with the fishes''
and ``what, the way I speak, it amuses you?'' Mob movies showed us
how to pay tribute, erase somebody execution style (one bullet,
behind the ear), die at a table over a plate of linguini in a white
clam sauce, just like a real made guy. Movies owned the Mafia _
even if the Mafia was rumored to own a little piece of the movies.
Until now. With the mid-season debut of HBO's ``The Sopranos,'' TV
has killed off the mob movie and made it its own. (Jubera, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   TRAVEL-DELIS _ NEW YORK _ On the first day of a Big Apple

The pepperiness of pastrami, the lusciouness of lox, the garlicky
tang of pickles so steeped in brine that they're almost white:
these are treats that clog the heart with cholesterol and joy.
``There's enough meat in those sandwiches for five normal ones _
they make your eyes pop out,'' enthused the schoolteacher. ``To the
folks back home I would say: anything that you thought was a deli
before you came here _ isn't!'' Indeed, New York is not only the
capital of deli _ it is deli, in ways that are mysterious and
profound. A tour of five great ones: Katz's, 2nd Avenue, Barney
Greengrass, Carnegie, Stage. (Hulbert, Atlanta

   TRENDS _ Utility chic is the latest buzzword in fashion circles.
Utility chic looks are comfortable, versatile and oh, so practical
and have emerged as the strongest trend for spring/summer 99. Think
pants and jackets with zippers, drawstring pants, Velcro and hoods.
There's a move on to de-emphasize oranmentation and go with simpler
fashions for the latest transitory lifestyles. It's a case where
less is certainly more. (Walton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   EVENINGWEAR _ The dressing-down themes continues in looks for
parties and After-5 affairs. Call it the ''glamour of comfort,''
which means sportswear separates in cottons and cashmere worn with
over long skirts in taffeta or jersey fabrics. Also think two piece
outfits instead of a single long gown. (Johnson, Atlanta

 Color slides of Jenna Elfman and Matthew McConaughey in a scene

 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    One minute she was the dizzy, Lucille Ball-like half of a new
comedy series ``Dharma and Gregg,'' the next she was Hollywood's
most wanted leading lady. The original, one and only Jenna Elfman
has been zooming up the Hollywood success ladder like greased
lightning.
 &HT;    Internationally, she's best known as the effervescent Dharma
Finkelstein, the San Francisco yoga instructor and dog trainer who
was raised by Bohemian parents and is now the wife of stuffy,
Harvard-educated lawyer Gregg Montgomery_played by Thomas Gibson.
 &HT;    Gibson is himself a hot property having secured a starring role
opposite Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' to be
released in July. But it's the 27-year-old Elfman who has everyone
talking_including Elfman herself. Just try and stop her!
 &HT;    ``I'm Dharma,'' she says, ``It's no big act. Dharma is an alive,
passionate girl. We're so similar. In real life it's definitely me.
I'm zany and my husband says I'm loveable as well.''
 &HT;    She's right. Sometimes it's hard to see where Dharma leaves off
and Elfman picks up. Tall (5-10) and skinny, she is lunching on a
huge sound stage at 20th Century Fox studios, where the show is
shot, and hurls words at you at express-train speed barely pausing
to take a breath.
 &HT;    On the the success of her comedy series, she said: ``It's got a
lot to do with the writing and a lot to do with the actors not
playing 'comedy.' You can't deliberately try to be funny_people
will squirm and be embarassed for you if you do.''
 &HT;    On the movie front she appeared last year opposite Richard
Dreyfuss and Lily Tomlin in the farce, ``Krippendorf's Tribe,''
which flopped. But that didn't dampen her career hopes.
 &HT;    In the weeks to come she'll show up in Ron Howard's ``EDtv,''
playing a character who's the opposite of Dharma. She's the shy,
insecure girlfriend of Matthew McConaughey who suddenly becomes
famous.
 &HT;    ``It's about a video store clerk (McConaughey) whose life is
televised live 24 hours a day. Only unlike 'The Truman Show' he
knows it's on TV and enjoys it. Then the whole country falls in
love with him. It's about what celebrity does to someone's life and
what it really means.''
 &HT;    In ``Town and Country'' (to be released later this year), Jenna
joins the legions of screen beauties who've played Warren Beatty's
girlfriends. ``When people ask me what it's about I tell
them...'It's Warren's life story,''' she laughs. ``In the film he
goes through a midlife crisis and cheats with a bunch of
women_including me.''
 &HT;    Before the hippie Dharma came along, Jenna, the youngest of
three children, grew up in the middleclass Los Angeles suburb of
Northridge with her parents_father Richard worked for an aircraft
company, mother Sue was a housewife. She wanted to be a ballet
dancer but ankle injuries destroyed that dream. She admits she
drifted through her earlier career_smoking pot and paying the rent
by working on TV commercials.
 &HT;    Growing up, she says, she was not the ebullient, confident
personality she has become. Studying under renowned acting teacher
Milton Katselas helped boost her confidence. And Hollywood sat up
and took notice three years ago when she won rave reviews for her
scene-stealing performance in ``Townies''_a series that was quickly
cancelled. After that she appeared regularly in guest roles in
``Roseanne,'' ``Murder One'' and ``NYPD Blue.''
 &HT;    Like John Travolta, Kirstie Alley and Tom Cruise, Jenna is a
follower of Scientology which she, like Travolta, says helped her
in her personal life and career.
 &HT;    She met her husband of four years, actor Bodhi Elfman, the
29-year-old nephew of Batman film composer Danny Elfman, when they
were auditioning for a TV commercial. Now the couple live in a
remodelled '50s-style house in the Hollywood Hills. It was Bohdi
who introduced her to Scientology.
 &HT;    Between rehearsals for a stage play in Hollywood she spends a
lot of her spare time these days visiting local animal shelters.
``I'm into rescuing and adopting animals,'' she says. ``I raise
money for the shelters because tens of millions of dogs are killed
every year. My latest find was a 6-month-old half-Lab, half-chow
who was going to be killed the next day.''
 &HT;    Spending time with her animals keeps her feet on the ground when
the acclaim and fame get overwhelming. ``It's been tough dealing
with the insanity of success and I haven't had a chance to even
take a deep breath and say, 'Wow.' I try to do it every day but so
much is happening so fast that I have to readjust every few days. I
stop and say, 'Alright...I've got it_OK.' I just have to stay in
present time.''

SHOCK ROCKER MARILYN MANSON COURTS CONTROVERSY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marilyn Manson has been described as sick, sacrilegious and a
serious threat to the moral fiber of America's children. His
concerts have been picketed by parents' groups and religious
organizations. Students have been sent home from school for wearing
his souvenir T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   According to Manson, all the hub-bub means he's doing what rock
stars are supposed to do: encouraging kids to think for themselves
while driving their parents crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``By changing the way they look, or playing a Marilyn Manson CD,
or wearing a Marilyn Manson T-shirt, they know that it infuriates
their parents, just the way their parents knew the Beatles
infuriated their parents, and Elvis Presley before them,'' Manson
said by phone from his home in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock 'n' roll should be dangerous. What I do, I try to make
provocative and challenging. Salvador Dali said that confusion is
the greatest form of communication, and I think that's absolutely
true. If it makes people think, then you're doing your job.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Manson and opening act Monster Magnet are set to
invade Compaq Center in Houston, even though Manson is recovering
from a sprained ankle suffered in a recent performance in Los
Angeles. He canceled shows in San Diego and Las Vegas this week,
but the Houston date is still on.
</P>
<P>
   Hole, which had been co-headlining the ``Rock Is Dead'' tour
with Manson, dropped off the bill following the Los Angeles
concert. While Hole's Courtney Love cited ``production issues'' as
her reason for quitting, the two stars had been taunting and
tossing barbs at each other from the stage since the tour began.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The interview with Manson was before Hole's departure. At the
time, he called the tour ``a perfect pairing ... that keeps the
excitement of rock 'n' roll alive.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said he'd had doubts about Love's commitment to
touring and her ability to control herself. On Monday, he told MTV
that Love's leaving was not a personal thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at times it looked like it could have been, and our
quarreling back and forth probably added to it all. The bottom line
was, it's not an easy slot going on before us. I think they were
unhappy with the way the crowds responded to them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to reconcile Manson's uninhibited and at times
grotesque stage performances with his articulate demeanor in
interviews. His replies were never less than thoughtful, if
somewhat disingenuous at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can't comprehend extremes the way I do,'' Manson said.
``I don't see anything unnatural about me having different levels
to my personality, different parts of me that come out at different
times. Some people see that as having multiple personality
disorder. I see it as being a creative, imaginative person.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson's latest album, ``Mechanical Animals,'' represents a
significant musical and lyrical evolution from his previous work.
While his earlier albums consisted of industrial-strength noise,
this time Manson offers some strong songs to back up his shock-rock
persona.
</P>
<P>
   In its swaggering sound and sly sense of humor, as well as its
ambiguous sexual imagery, ``Mechanical Animals'' recalls the
glam-rock golden age of '70s David Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the few people that stood out to me as a kid.
Bowie combined the excitement of a book or a movie and put that
into rock 'n' roll,'' said Manson, 29, who grew up as Brian Warner
in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a whole world that he created, along with people
like KISS, and Prince and Madonna and Boy George. That's how I
expected all rock 'n' roll to be. From the beginning, I've always
considered my image and my songs to be just as important to my
whole aesthetic.``
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that Manson chose his stage name from two
American icons, Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson _ one female, one
male; one viewed as a tragic victim, the other the psychotic
personification of evil in contemporary society.
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, Manson assumes the
role of an androgynous character, Coma White, on ``Mechanical
Animals.'' But he says the album reveals more of the erstwhile
Brian Warner than his last album, ``Antichrist Superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On `Antichrist Superstar,' I was trying to bring about my own
apocalypse. Out of dissatisfaction with the world, I was trying to
destroy it or destroy myself. So I just put myself through as much
as I could, hoping to either become something stronger or be done
with it all. And I think that I became something stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I realized was that it was a matter of having all the
emotions that I'd shut off.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Manson is disavowing his earlier work or conceding
anything to those who object to his perceived influence on young
fans. When Manson performed at Houston's Aerial Theater in
November, concerned individuals, including city Councilman Rob
Todd, implored the city to ban the show.
</P>
<P>
   Citing First Amendment rights, Mayor Lee Brown upheld the
group's right to perform. The show went on, although Manson angrily
stomped off early after fans threw beer at the sound-mixing
console, causing technical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no organized protest to this concert, but Todd
has not changed his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central issue is that publicly funded venues should
restrict their acts to those that are within community standards,''
he said. ``The fact that Courtney Love considered this act to be
beneath her standards shows you that it is not within Houston's
community standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps with an eye toward stirring up more controversy, Manson
compares himself to Christ and claims to know more about
Christianity than most Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus was really the first celebrity, if you think about it.
He symbolized so much suffering and so much sexuality. That became
an important part of the rock-star icon. So if people are going to
be mad at me, they have to be mad at themselves, because it's their
religion that I was inspired by, more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who's mad at Marilyn Manson is mad at him for
religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Marks, former executive editor of Spin magazine, filed a
$24 million lawsuit against Manson last month. The lawsuit alleges
that Manson's bodyguards slammed Marks against a wall at a November
concert while Manson threatened to kill him because the star was
angry that Spin decided not to feature him on the cover of its
January issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this whole incident with Spin is someone's idea of
getting publicity,'' Manson said. ``Just because I had a simple
argument with someone doesn't mean that I did the things that he
said. I completely deny all of his allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's ironic that he got fired from Spin. I think that
shows that he doesn't really have the backing of his magazine on
his side of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Spin spokesman Jason Roth confirmed that Marks has been fired,
but said his departure had nothing to do with the lawsuit. He said
the magazine still supports Marks' claims against Manson.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy surrounding Manson came home to one Houston-area
family in a tragic way. In December, 12-year-old Beau Beasley of
Katy, Texas, shot himself to death, leaving behind a note quoting
Manson's ``Get Your Gunn.'' The lyrics include ``I throw a little
fit/I slit my little wrist/The most that I can learn/Is in the
records that you burn/Get your gunn, get your gunn, get your gunn
...''
</P>
<P>
   Manson _ who said he's discussed having children with his
fiancee, actress Rose McGowan _ was unaware of Beasley's suicide.
He said he sympathizes with the pain the boy's parents feel, but he
declines to assume responsibility for the impact his music may have
on listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put the blame on anything you want,'' he said. ``I'm
the easiest person to point the finger at, because it's
traditional, and I assume the role of the villain.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson hopes his music encourages kids to strive to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think I'm the only one who cares or believes in
the fans, the kids. What I'm telling them the most is that no
matter how much everyone doubts you or how much you think you don't
belong, it doesn't matter. The world is what you create in your own
head. Why let other people tell you how it should be?''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Beasley, Beau's father, said Manson underestimates
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the rock scene better than he might imagine. I
played in bands from 1967 to 1974 and enjoyed some success. Outrage
has always been a part of rock 'n' roll, but it has never been a
substitute for excellence. So far, he has excelled only at
controversy and deadly influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Beasley is not planning legal action at this time, but he warns
that Manson would do well to consider his legacy and his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support freedom of speech, but there are limits, and Manson
has gone beyond them intentionally for fame and profit. I suspect
he will disappear on the scrap heap of rock once his shock value
fades. Maybe then he'd like to see my son's suicide note and
reconsider his part. Probably not.''

DIRECTOR BOORMAN TAKES `REVENGE' ON MASTER THIEF 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The General,'' the latest outstanding film from John Boorman,
is much different from what we've seen before from the British
director.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman has twice been Oscar-nominated as best director, for
``Deliverance'' and ``Hope and Glory,'' both best-picture nominees.
</P>
<P>
   His personal approach and distinctly sensual visual styling have
enhanced such films as ``Point Blank,'' ``Excalibur,'' ``The
Emerald Forest'' and ``Beyond Rangoon.'' Even his failures
(``Exorcist II'') have had visually interesting elements and
personal touches.
</P>
<P>
   But Boorman does not think the almost documentary approach and
stark black-and-white photography of ``The General'' should
surprise those who really know him and his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always try to match the visual style to the subject and
particularly to the character,'' Boorman said, calling recently
from London.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's a way of expressing character, which is one reason
why I wanted to do it in black- and-white. I feel that color always
romanticizes, particularly poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not want to romanticize ``The General,'' the story of
real-life Irish criminal mastermind Martin Cahill. Cahill was a
burglar, but not a common one. He led his own extensive gang, which
robbed homes but also pulled off large capers, including the
largest jewel heist in Irish history. Cahill was murdered _
apparently by the Irish Republican Army, which he had crossed _ in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars Irish actor Brendan Gleeson as Cahill and
co-stars Jon Voight, a Boorman pal since ``Deliverance,'' as one of
the policeman trying to capture the crook.
</P>
<P>
   Movies about criminals often make their subjects into heroes.
Cahill, portrayed with stark, mug-shot clarity in ``The General,''
is no hero. He committed many dastardly deeds.
</P>
<P>
   But if not romanticism, a rather reluctant admiration for Cahill
does come through clearly. Boorman, who was once a victim of the
Dublin gangster, freely admits it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In common with a lot of people in Ireland, (I have) a grudging
admiration for the man because of his wit and humor and sheer
cheek,'' Boorman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sort of took on the world. Toward the end, when things were
falling apart around him and he was still determined to oppose the
police and all the other forces around him, you can't help but
somehow admire that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his twisted way, Cahill, whose title of General matched his
ability to pull off a virtual war against society, was amazing. He
openly thumbed his nose at the police, who knew of his crimes but
not how to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman, who has lived in Dublin almost 30 years, first became
aware of Cahill years ago when his house was burgled.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, (Cahill) was just a burglar, working on his
own,'' Boorman said. ``But he was pulling off extraordinary
burglaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the stolen items was a gold record Boorman had for the
music in ``Deliverance.''
</P>
<P>
   The record was never recovered, and no one was convicted of the
theft, but police assured Boorman that Cahill did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they couldn't get any evidence against him,''
Boorman said. ``That was the first time I heard his name. When he
started to do these bigger robberies, I remembered the name and
followed his career with great interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie has a scene in which Cahill, having come home from his
rounds, pulls out the gold record and is disgusted but amused to
find that it is made of plastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagined how he might have reacted when he found that it
wasn't actually made of gold,'' Boorman said. ``He thought it was
made of solid gold or he wouldn't have taken the trouble to steal
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The items he took from my house, (were) some Georgian silver
and one or two other things that were very valuable, and left
everything else. He didn't make any kind of mess; he got in very
cleverly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I was very annoyed at the time. It was very
upsetting that he could get in that easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Boorman chuckles: ``But I got my revenge, if you like.''

GROUP BIDS FOR PHOENIX COYOTES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - An ownership group headed by entertainment mogul and
Phoenix Suns partner Barry Kemp has an offer on the table to
purchase the Phoenix Coyotes from owner Richard Burke for an
estimated $80 million to $100 million and keep the team in Phoenix,
``The Arizona Republic'' has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Burke accepts the offer depends on a number of factors,
including the outcome of a May 18 vote in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
related to a new arena and whether he is willing to continue to
sustain large losses as the single owner of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Burke has been looking for a partner in the franchise but has
denied that he is interested in selling the team outright. Reached
late Wednesday, he said he isn't selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is no,'' Burke said. ``It was a verbal proposal and
I've turned that offer down. It's gone no further than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the timing of the leak about a sale could be meant
to subvert a positive vote on the Los Arcos Mall project with the
new arena, Burke said, ``I'm not one who attributes motives, but
the first this came up is when the Los Arcos project was announced.
The second time around it the was the (Scottsdale) City Council
vote. And the third time was the legislative vote (on stadium
districts).
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Arcos will happen and we're going to stick it through,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three out-of-town sources associated with both the National
Basketball Association and National Hockey League told ``The
Republic'' the sale will be done by June if voters side against the
formation of a stadium district in Scottsdale. If they say yes,
Scottsdale voters will go to the polls this fall on whether the
developers can keep about $200 million in state-generated sales
taxes from the new sports complex.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, when reached at his office in Southern California,
confirmed his group's interest in the Coyotes. But he indicated
that a sale is not set in stone and termed the time frame
premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am heading a group, mostly comprised of people from the
entertainment world, that has expressed interest in purchasing the
Coyotes, if for some reason the new arena in Scottsdale does not go
forward,'' Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, 49, is a former executive director of the Phoenix Chamber
of Commerce. He now owns a television and movie production
corporation called Bungalow 78 Productions, which has produced
long-running television hits such as ``Taxi,'' ``Coach'' and
``Newhart,'' as well as feature-length movies such as ``Romy and
Michelle's High School ``Reunion'' and ``Patch Adams.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp owns 6 percent of the Suns and is involved both in limited
and general partnership groups with the team. He also owns the Long
Beach Ice Dogs of the International Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty it's still premature and there really hasn't
been any indication that Richard is that interested and he has made
it very clear that his first priority is Scottsdale. If the arena
doesn't go in Scottsdale, and he was going to sell the franchise
and move it, we would like the option to buy the team and keep it
in Phoenix. But, again, it's contingent on something not happening
in Scottsdale.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the reported purchase price, Kemp said, ``In fairness,
that's more or less what the range of offers is for the bulk of NHL
teams _ other than the New York Rangers, of course _ so it's in the
range.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke and his then-partner, Steven Gluckstern, purchased the
then-Winnipeg Jets for $68 million in October 1995. The team
changed names and began play in Phoenix at the start of the 1996-97
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest would be to keep the team at America West,'' Kemp
said. ``I have a strong feeling about Phoenix as a sports center. I
also have a strong feeling that as a result of what Jerry Colangelo
has done there, and as a small-percentage owner of the Suns who has
admired the way he has operated those franchises, it's where we
want to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think America West is one of the premier sports venues in
the country and one that other venues still compare themselves to.
The people like going there _ I know I like going there _ and you
can't discount something like that. Between it and Bank One
Ballpark, it's the center of Phoenix sports and the Coyotes have
certainly become part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp said no other minority owners of the Suns are included in
his group.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, 55, repeatedly has denied he has interest in selling the
Coyotes outright. But he has never denied an interest in finding
new partners, and last month told a Valley radio audience that he
had an offer to buy the team but wasn't interested.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kemp said that his group has no interest in becoming a
minority owner in the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally not interested in joining a new arena in
Scottsdale _ nothing against Scottsdale, because I love it there,''
he said. ``But Phoenix already has something that works in
Phoenix.`'
</P>
<P>
   That has been the center of debate between Burke, America West
officials and officials of Phoenix government, which recently
unveiled plans to reconfigure America West Arena to make it more
hockey friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Phoenix announced a plan to give the arena a $12
million upgrade that would leave the facility with about 17,500
seats with clear views for hockey and arena football. Count the
2,500 or so ``obstructed-view''seats that would remain after the
renovation, and the arena capacity would top 20,000. The arena
currently has 16,210 seats for hockey _ less than 12,000 of which
are unobstructed _ and 19,023 for basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, founder and former chairman and chief executive officer
of United HealthCare Corp., partnered with Gluckstern until
Gluckstern divested his interest in the Coyotes to head an
ownership group that purchased the NHL New York Islanders before
the 1997-98 season, leaving Burke the financial burden alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are estimated to lose $4 million to $6 million this
season. Burke said this year that he was expecting total financial
losses of at least $50 million by the time the NHL team's lease
expires at America West Arena in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have pointed to the losses that are created by 4,200
sight-obstructed seats at America West, and a lease agreement that
restricts revenue streams from luxury suites, signage and various
other forms of corporate partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Kemp, because of his partnership with Colangelo,
believes he can work out a friendlier lease agreement with Arena
Management, a subsidiary of the Suns. Along with the reconfigured
seating, a new lease agreement could make team ownership more cost
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I can do that,'' Kemp said about the lease.
``We would assume the same lease that Richard has. Whether it can
be improved, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked for his thoughts about the proposed sale, Colangelo
refused comment, only saying it is a situation involving Burke and
Kemp and that he is not involved.

 &HT;    Teachers' battle scars worse when brass won't back them up
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Everybody knows, said everybody, that schools are
awash in violence.
</P>
<P>
   So when Horace Mann Insurance Corp. made news last year with
``assault recovery'' insurance for school personnel, everyone could
see policies selling like curly fries.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone except teachers.
</P>
<P>
   As of year's end, though available in 45 states, only about 300
policies had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Several theories: First, teachers can't afford it, even with
modest premiums of $4 a month. Second, falsely or not, some believe
themselves sufficiently insured against injury on the job through
workers compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Third, it's safe to say that most teachers don't look at their
students as the greatest threat to them.
</P>
<P>
   They think of students' parents, with attorneys at their elbows,
as that threat, and spineless administrators as No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers have a cop's mentality. They expect to step into fights
and expose themselves to cuts and scrapes. They expect to have
problem children explode in their faces. They expect the drill of
hauling a chronic brawler down the hall while the child bites at
your wrists.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't expect is to have the little brawler-mauler back
in class before the next potty break.
</P>
<P>
   They don't expect school districts to make mince meat of their
own zero-tolerance discipline policies because Johnny, into double
digits with his demerits (three is the expressed limit in Waco
schools), is judged a ``special needs'' child, meaning that
``zero'' computes as ``infinite,'' tolerance-wise.
</P>
<P>
   This was some of the frustration that bubbled forth in Austin
when teachers rallied on behalf of a bill called the Classroom
Discipline Act.
</P>
<P>
   The act, carried in the Senate by Houston Democrat John Whitmire
and in the House by Rep. Rick Noriega (D-Houston), would give force
of law to discipline techniques once considered sacrosanct.
</P>
<P>
   Protected under this act: teachers' authority to ``verbally
discipline'' a student; to physically isolate a student in the
classroom; to withhold classroom privileges; and to use ``a
physically harmless prop in disciplining a student.'' Yes, like a
dunce cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean to say,'' everyone will say, ``teachers can't do that
now?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes they can, by and large. But they know that school districts
quake at the sight of parents bearing lawyers, and that sometimes
principals will succumb to a lobbying Ma and Pa insisting that
their Precious was unfairly singled out, humiliated and
life-scarred by a stern teacher.
</P>
<P>
   One can see problems with legislation of this sort. If a teacher
goes off the deep end with an abusive, window-shattering rant, is
it protected as ``verbal discipline''? Is an ankle chained to a
tetherball poll the use of ``harmless prop''? What about when a
teacher truly and cruelly singles a kid out?
</P>
<P>
   But one can see more benefits than problems were the state to
provide backup for teachers on discipline matters when
administrators won't.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Texas Association of School Boards and
Texas Association of School Administrators oppose this.
</P>
<P>
   School districts ``already have the authority to do all of this
right now,'' said the administrators group. Yes, they do. But ask
teachers and find they too often feel that their hands, raw from
being gnawed, can be tied in trying to control things.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation runs counter to the ``local control'' mantra
lawmakers spout but rarely honor (see Texas Assessment of Academic
Skills). Whitmire says local control is fine, but his bill is the
backup teachers need. ``The bottom line is they're (administrators)
afraid of parents. They're afraid of lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator sounds like a teacher.

IN AUCTIONS, IT'S `BIDDER'S BEWARE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: eBay is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I spend so much time on computers because most of my favorite TV
shows have been cancelled. Lovejoy, for instance--a charming
British series about a corrupt but kind-hearted antiques dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC cancelled Lovejoy just as the Internet was catching on.
Too bad. With Internet fraud complaints up 600 percent last year,
according to the National Consumers League, the Web could have
provided fodder for a dozen episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Cindy Allen. She's a biochemist turned
antiques expert, furnishing her home in North Andover, Mass. with
classic lighting fixtures purchased on-line. That's how she met
Zeev Shenkman , vice-chairman of USA Bancshares Inc., which runs a
bank in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Allen and Shenkman share a love of fine glassware, a fondness
for Internet shopping and an unhappy relationship with Bette in
Oregon. Bette asked me to use her on-line name, but you can get her
real name in about 30 seconds. She's a former car dealer who now
tends her ailing husband at home. Bette fattens the household bank
account by purchasing garage-sale bric-a-brac and reselling it on
eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Of course you know eBay, an on-line auction site that's become
one of the 'Net's most impressive success stories. eBay is open to
anybody with something to sell. Just register as an eBay member and
you can sell practically anything -- except guns and vital organs
-- to the highest bidder. eBay merely gets a listing fee and a cut
of the final sale price. But since eBay moves 700,000 items a day,
it's one of the few Internet businesses that actually makes money.
</P>
<P>
   eBay has always made me nervous. Partly it's because I like
eating. The eBay auctions compete against newspaper classified ads,
which generate about a third of the Globe's revenues and pay a
goodly part of my salary.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the nagging doubt that comes from doing costly
trades with people you've never clapped eyes on. What if you ship
the product and never get a check? Or what if the seller skips town
with your money, or sells you junk that doesn't live up to
expectations? eBay will provide the seller's real name and phone
number -- that's how I found Bette. But what if the merchant still
refuses to make good?
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the complaint that Allen and Shenkman have levied
against Bette. Allen paid $2,055 for a lamp; Shenkman $1,571 for a
vase. Each says the merchandise wasn't what they had in mind, and
asked for refunds. No way, Bette said.
</P>
<P>
   Now everybody's furious. Allen has complained to the Oregon
Department of Justice, with Shenkman's avid support. ``For the
wrong people,'' fumes Allen, ``the Internet is a license to
steal.'' Bette replies that Allen is trying to defraud her of her
rightful fee by stirring up other customers and the cops. ``I am
sure that I am going to be arrested and taken away to court,''
Bette gripes.
</P>
<P>
   So do Allen and Shenkman have a legitimate gripe? It's not
entirely clear. Indeed, their complaints may stem from a series of
misunderstandings. So a better question is how Internet shoppers
can avoid such unpleasantness.
</P>
<P>
   eBay can't afford to become known as Ground Zero for suckers, so
the company practically begs users to shop smart. ``Use your own
common sense,'' urges company spokesman Kevin Pursglove. For
instance, eBay posts customer feedback so you can see if a seller
or buyer has earned a bad reputation. Never do business without
checking the feedback messages. They'll include the person's e-mail
address.
</P>
<P>
   Look for sellers who actually pay for their Internet accounts.
If a seller uses a free Web-based e-mail service like Hotmail, he
may disappear once the check clears.
</P>
<P>
   eBay offers some transaction insurance for purchases below $200.
Above that, the company urges buyers and sellers to use escrow
services, fledgling companies that exist to provide security to
buyers and sellers alike. Ads on the eBay site tout San Mateo-based
I-Escrow Inc. For 5 percent of the purchase price, I-Escrow will
hold a buyer's money, releasing it to the seller after the goods
are delivered and the buyer is satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   But so far only a fraction of Internet trades are escrowed,
making sites like eBay a happy hunting ground for ripoff artists.
Poor Lovejoy. He got out of the business too soon.

ESCAPED SLAVE'S STORY STUNS TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the audience: The students of Dover-Sherborn Regional High
School, some of the richest, most privileged public school students
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   On the podium: Moctar Teyeb, 39, runaway slave.
</P>
<P>
   The young people gaped at glimpses of a world they never
imagined could still exist. The visitor broke down and sobbed when
he was made an honorary Dover-Sherborn scholar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black families are ripped apart when masters give their
relatives slaves as gifts,'' Teyeb told an audience as utterly free
as any on earth. ``In your history classes, you have learned how
this was done to black slave families in America, but to me, it is
not history. It is happening today in my country, to my people, to
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Teyeb, a native of the West African nation of Mauritania, has
been likened to Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery in the
South to become a leading abolitionist.
</P>
<P>
   Teyeb escaped Mauritania when he was 19 and his master moved
from a remote rural area to the capital. Passing through a
then-nascent network of slavery opponents, he found his way to
schools and colleges in Morocco and Libya. He moved to New York 3
1/2 years ago, and may soon move to Boston to work more closely
with Charles Jacobs, president of the American Anti-Slavery Group
in Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Teyeb and Jacobs stunned students with the revelation that
slavery still exists in the world, in varying forms, and then
challenged them to join a new world-wide abolitionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   While human bondage has receded to historical memory in much of
the world, the anti-slavery group estimates there are about a
million carpet-making slaves, mostly children, in the subcontinent,
hundreds of thousands of sex slaves in southeast Asia, and a
million blacks serving Arabs in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Though a US-based movement against these practices has existed
since the early 1990s, interest has soared with the national
publicity given the issue last year when a Denver fifth grade class
raised $22,000 to buy freedom for slaves in the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs currently is embroiled in controversy with the United
Nations Children's Fund, which opposes buying freedom for slaves on
grounds that it constitutes participation in the slavery system and
spurs demand for more slaves to be captured.
</P>
<P>
   Teyeb thanked the Dover-Sherborn students for their concern, but
then challenged them to consider ``why have my people been
abandoned? There are so many international organizations and
government agencies. They fight famine, natural disasters, child
abuse, domestic violence, political detentions and more. Why have
all these organizations been silent'' on slavery?
</P>
<P>
   He told the students that, now that they were aware of the
reality of slavery, they had to grapple with what it means to be so
free as they are when so many people know no freedom at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today my family, my people, and I are all still waiting for
the right to become human beings,'' he said. ``And we are looking
to you. . .to use your education and freedom to help set us free.''
</P>
<P>
   For the students, their encounter with Teyeb was a most unusual
``seminar day,'' which the high school sets aside more or less
annually for discussion of regions and issues remote from the daily
life of the school. Students selected the topics and arranged for
the speakers themselves. A talk on child slavery in the Indian
subcontinent and a workshop on how wealth and privilege affect
community development also were on Wednesday's program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to have them understand issues of diversity and
intolerance both here and globally,'' said Donna Nuzzo-Mueller, the
principal. ``It is especially important for students who have such
a wonderful education and who will be successful to know what it is
that the world really needs.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, most of the teens said they were
chastened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know there was still slavery around. It's unheard
of,'' said Jonathan Boyd, 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew about child labor, but this, . . .'' added Corey
Johnson, 17. ``I didn't know.''

ARKANSAS COLLEGE'S OPTIONS INSPIRE TENURE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONWAY, Ark. _ Winfred Thompson wants to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But caveat emptor, his critics say; what he is selling could
destroy the soul of the modern American university.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is this: every new hire at The University of Central
Arkansas, where Thompson is president, can get tenure or a
tenure-track position, or a 50 percent salary premium and a
three-year rolling contract. Those on contract can be fired, but
they still get two years' notice _ far more, Thompson notes, than
anyone in corporate America would ever receive.
</P>
<P>
   To Thompson, it's a matter of choice and of increasing
professors' productivity at a time when universities are under
suspicion of not paying enough attention to teaching and tuitions
that continue to increase faster than inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But to tenure's defenders, the deal threatens to make
prostitutes out of professors. Tenure guarantees freedom, they say,
and freedom is not something to be surrendered to the highest
bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the debate indicates the ground shifting under the
concept of tenure, codified 84 years ago to guarantee stability and
free expression in academia. While few institutions are getting rid
of it altogether, critics and advocates alike say tenure is being
eroded in many smaller moves.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's initiative, approved by the public university's
trustees last week, is the most dramatic of these moves. The
question it will answer, tenure watchers say, is this: Is tenure an
inalienable principle, or does that principle have a price?
</P>
<P>
   ``This shifts the debate from tenure as a cherished principle to
a negotiable condition,'' said Richard Chait, a professor who is
studying the case as part of a national project on tenure for the
Graduate School of Education at Harvard. ``It's no longer an issue
of whether to sell one's services; it's how much will it cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenures defenders and critics alike say that the more professors
operate without tenure, the harder it becomes for those who have it
to defend it as an inalienable right.
</P>
<P>
   To those who dislike putting tenure up for sale, ``it's a
question of whether people are being paid to have their viewpoints
muzzled,'' Chait said. ``On the other hand, choice and voluntarism
are hard to counter. In an academy where academic freedom is the
watchword, one has to ask does academic freedom extend to the
freedom to determine the best lawful circumstances under which one
wishes to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of tenure have always defended it on two points. One,
it ensures that professors can discuss controversial subjects
without fear of losing their jobs. Two, lifetime tenure, with
removal only for significant cause, was an incentive to enter a
relatively low-paying profession.
</P>
<P>
   But with downsizing and efficiency the new bywords outside the
academy, lifetime job security has come to seem more unrealistic
even within it. Just north of this college town, for instance, two
plant closings led to more than 1,000 job cuts in January. If
companies can do it, tenure critics say, why not universities, when
students begin to demand, say, fewer courses in literature and more
in computer science?
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in tenure is the sheer decline in the
percentage of professors who have it, the lowest percentage since
the American Association of University Professors formulated the
first widely used policy on it in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   According to the association, the percentage of faculty with
tenure dropped to 30 in 1995 from 36 in 1975, and the percentage of
faculty on tenure track dropped to 12 from 20 in that same time.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges and universities began replacing those faculty with
part-time and nontenure-track faculty; the percentage of faculty in
positions that were not tenure track increased to 16 from 13
between 1975 and 1995, and the percentage of faculty who work part
time increased to 41 from 31.
</P>
<P>
   But even within the ranks who have tenure, there are more
strictures. More and more schools began requiring professors to
undergo post-tenure review; a representative study done by the the
American Association for Higher Education in 1996 found that 29
percent of schools have post-tenure review, and legislatures in
Wisconsin and California now require it. The University of Nebraska
has used tenure buy-outs to thin its numbers of tenured professors.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson announced his initiative in a speech welcoming the
faculty back on campus in August.
</P>
<P>
   While most professors start at $35,000 a year _ a competitive
salary for universities of this size _ those on the three-year
rolling contracts would start at $50,000-$55,000, and would
continue to receive a salary that was 40-50 percent higher than
tenured positions as they stayed in their jobs. The contract would
be renewed every year for an additional three years if performance
remained satisfactory, meaning anyone who was fired would get two
years' notice. And contracts would include a provision guaranteeing
academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislature approved funding for 30 of the new
positions for this year; the university will decide later whether
to offer now-tenured or tenure-track professors the chance to
switch to a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of tenure is fine,'' Thompson said in an interview
in his office on this tidy, new campus. ``After a certain period of
time, people should only be removed for cause. But the longer I
have served, the more concerned I have become that we tolerate
behavior and performance that is detrimental to students and to the
institution, and we're not doing anything about it because the
procedural requirements of the tenure system have made it so
cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only for the most egregious personal behavior that we
ever dismiss someone. It usually has nothing to do with the ability
to teach, and it results in the almost certainty of a lawsuit. The
expense is so great, the experience is just not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The boyish-looking former congressional aide has become known as
a change agent in his 11 years as president, setting up an honors
college and suing the state board of higher education for the right
to award doctorates in physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes, however, have included the removal of only one
tenured professor. The American Association of University
Professors is still investigating the case, so Thompson won't speak
about it, but articles written about it suggest that the professor
was fired only after he began spitting at administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators here say they don't envision firing many people
on the new contracts. The benefit to the university, they say, is
that it can cut positions in the event of a budget crisis. More
immediately, the threat of termination puts a fire under the
faculty on contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does provide some incentive for faculty to continue to
contribute to the institution,'' said Provost John Mosbo. ``There
certainly is a public perception that once faculty are tenured,
professors go into semiretirement. These may be isolated cases, but
these situations are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Of two people hired since the policy was discussed, Mosbo said,
neither was interested in the premium. One, he said, thought tenure
offered prestige, the other said tenure was simply ``the way it
works'' at a university.
</P>
<P>
   But Mosbo himself, a former chemistry professor, said it would
have appealed to him when he arrived 25 years ago. Like many, he
had heavy bills for his education, and faith that his work was
good.
</P>
<P>
   But professors on campus worry that the system will cause too
much disruption, with the potential for professors coming and
going. Those who take the deal might be less committed to the
institution. And whatever stress the six-year bid for tenure might
inflict, it also ensures that the university hires those who meet
the highest academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tenure is a very symbolic thing,'' said Linda Shalick, a
professor of occupational therapy. ``It's symbolic of job security,
and it represents a commitment, from the university to the
professor, and the professor to the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while there is some concern here, there is even louder
consternation outside Arkansas about the initiative for fear of any
contagious effect. The dismay among tenure advocates is the
creeping corporate model in a place long protected from the
concerns of profit-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we say the corporate model reigns supreme, even in
education, you've blunted the critical function the university
performs, which is to criticize established thought,'' said Matthew
Finkin, a professor of law at the University of Illinois and author
of ``The Case for Tenure.''
</P>
<P>
   Academic freedom, Finkin and others worry, cannot be guaranteed
with a contract; administrators can make up reasons for dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   To the American Association of University Professors, the small
but steady assaults on tenure attack the very essence of the
university.

WEBBIES PROMISE AWARDS; `THE ULTIMATE BOOKMARK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As I write this column, my computer is being attacked by an army
of little Netscape boxes bouncing around the monitor screen.
They're going ba-ding, ba-boom, like browser windows on
amphetamines. This is not a joke, nor is it a virus. It's art:
conceptual art. Cyber art. Caroming art. This performance of sorts
is brought to you by the folks at http://www.jodi.org _ enter at
your own risk.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm getting ahead of myself. The invasion of the dancing
boxes began after a chat with Tiffany Shlain, executive producer of
the Webby Awards. Trumpeted as ``the Oscars of the Internet,'' the
awards honor the best (and the strangest) Web sites in 22
categories, from art and science, fashion and film, to just plain
weird. The ceremony, set for next March 18, began three years ago
as a downbeat digerati gathering but has evolved into an upscale
event at San Francisco's Herbst Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Schlain is bullish on the ceremony, hailing its
significance in the Big Picture. ``Our nominees reflect the growth
of the Web, which has infiltrated every part of society,'' she
says. The roster (http://www.webbieawards.com) provides an
``ultimate bookmark,'' she vows, a guide to the hottest trends and
sites on line.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a bright idea to peruse the list, searching for
the inner secrets, the deep existential meaning of the exhaustive
yet exhilarating World Wide Web. Several hours of ``research''
revealed one simple truth: You can surf forever and have a few good
rides, but you can never probe the depths of this massive medium.
It also affirmed a few things most folks already know: Webmasters
can be commercial giants, college professors, or kids with a
particular obsession. Some folks are in it for money (we skipped
the Amazonian e-commerce nominees); some folks trade information;
others seek a few laughs.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of high culture (or slavish allegiance to
alphabetical order), we started with the arts. The ParkBench Web
site (at http://www.cat.nyu.edu/parkbench/) treats you to a
gigantic click-on slide show, eye-candy for empty hours. An
ingenious site called the Multicultural Recycler
(http://www.shoko.calarts.edu/alex/recycler.html) creates a new
form of digital found art. It fans the Web for live images from Web
cams in dorm rooms and boudoirs, mixes them up, and creates a
recycled collage. It's the brainchild of California artist Amy
Alexander. ``When Web cameras became popular, it seemed like Andy
Warhol's 15 minutes of fame coming to fruition,'' she says. ``I
wanted to take that idea and spoof it: If these are the celebrities
of the day, I would do the cultural recycling of the day and make
an art piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: jodi.org. When you enter the site, your browser
breaks up into those tiny dancing boxes, and when you frantically
try to catch them, a larger window turns into a surreal mirror
image of your own desktop. A Net search (on Excite) revealed a few
artspeak descriptions and this bit from HotWired: ``This nameless,
anonymous . . . and seemingly purposeless Web site is an immense
labyrinth of dead ends, blink tags, grainy GIFs, primary colors,
and oversized code. One page turns up grainy pictures of pigeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Try as I might, I couldn't find the pigeons. Darn. But I did
find an e-mail address and fired off a message to jodi.org's
creators, whoever they might be.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the search on the ``ultimate bookmark.'' One of the
nominations in the community category is http://www.ivillage.com,
which promises ``real solutions for real women.'' The top story was
a primer on how to ``banish belly bulge,'' but ultimate abs aside,
the site does offer some discussion of serious topics.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion category boasts some sites that are more amusing _
and less Victoria's Secret-like _ than you might think. The New
York-based http://www.papermag.com explores such topics as Cultural
Sushi and Tchotchke of the Week. ``Ask Mr. Mickey'' is a ``demented
weekly schmashion column,'' which is pretty rich.
</P>
<P>
   The film category features http://www.darkhorizons.com, which is
run by a 20-year-old from Sydney named Garth Franklin who combines
the dish of Mr. Showbiz with the dirt of Matt Drudge.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the categories cover all the hot topics on the Web,
like the buzz over MP3 and the rise of Net radio. Surfing became a
blur of usual suspects in the zine category (Feed, Salon, Nerve,
Slate). The weird category is, well, weird. Funny, the only site we
couldn't access was in this category, the one at
www.unamerican.com. Maybe it's a right-wing conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it was time to stop surfing and finish this column, an
e-mail arrived from jodi.org, run by Flemish cyber artists Joan
Heemskark and Dirk Paesmans. ``The moving screens, in a way,
disrupt the normal sense of a browser,'' says Heemskark. The site
frequently changes, leading the browser on a surrealistic cyber
chase and sometimes crashing the computer. And that's part of the
point: ``We want viewers to have the feeling that everything they
see cannot be taken for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   The jodi.org duo brings an edge to the increasingly commercial
Webbies, which this year honor such titans of capitalism as EBay,
Amazon, and, gulp, the Gap. Webbie award speeches are limited to
five words, and Paesmans says his speech might be a countdown to a
cyberblast. If he wins, he'll say, ``Five, four, three, two, one .
. .'' And that will be the end of it.

TWO NEW ACURAS WORTH THE MONEY

 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A is for Acura.
</P>
<P>
   B is for bargain.
</P>
<P>
   C is for car, but you wouldn't expect A and B to add up to an
Acura.
</P>
<P>
   But one Acura fits this formula.
</P>
<P>
   After having the privilege of spending two weeks with a pair of
Acuras, first a sporty/luxury 1999 3.2 TL, then the 3.5 RL luxury
sedan, I proclaim the 3.2 TL a bargain. Even though it carries a
price tag of $28,405 (including destination charge), it compares
favorably with cars selling for up to $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Acura calls it a ``performance luxury sedan,'' a bit grander
than my description of it as a highly desirable four-door sports
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   This was one car I really would have liked to hold onto when the
time came to turn it back.
</P>
<P>
   But, before giving it up, I spun by an Acura dealer just to
confirm that the price, as they say, was right.
</P>
<P>
   It was _ and all but one of the TLs on this lot had ``sold''
stickers on them, proving that buyers were seeing the same thing I
was: lots of car for the money.
</P>
<P>
   From the responsive 3.2-liter, 24-valve, VTEC V6 coupled with a
four-speed automatic with a Sequential SportShift (you can use it
strictly as an automatic or swing the selector lever to another
gate and use itas a semimanual) to the 16-inchtires, it was a
pleasure to drivethis car.
</P>
<P>
   This all-new for '99 TL is the descendant of the Vigor and the
previous TL in the Acura line. Andit's the best of the bunch.
Morepower, better rear-seat legroom,a quieter riding experience
andlower price make this more car for less money.
</P>
<P>
   The only available option _ the Acura Navigation System ($2,000)
_ was a hoot. Three programmed trips brought us:
</P>
<P>
   1. Directly to a restaurant at Marina Bay in Quincy, Mass. Not a
big deal, but this was our first venture off Quincy Shore Drive and
the voice of our ``navigator'' brought us directly to the door we
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   2. To Portsmouth, N.H., without missing a turn. On the return
trip, the ``voice'' demanded a left turn as we (er, I) blithely
drove by the on-ramp to Interstate 95, earning a carful of cheerful
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   3. Delivered us to the wrong end of Hanover Avenue, a tiny,
one-way alleyway off Hanover Street in Boston's North End.
</P>
<P>
   Add in the other amenities _ power everything, heated leather
seats, single-CD player/Bose five-speaker sound system, electric
moonroof _ and you've got quite a package.
</P>
<P>
   The responsive ride was appropriate for the car, the legroom was
fine in back, and all in our party of criics-for-a-day fell in
love with the car . . . right back to its silver-tipped dual
exhaust extensions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
RL as in really luxurious
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A is for act _ because the TL should have been a tough act for
the 3.5 RL to follow.
</P>
<P>
   B, however, is for a bonafide, as in bonafide luxury sedan,
which the RL is.
</P>
<P>
   C is for cost. This is a $41,900 MSRP (plus $455 destination
charge) luxury sedan, redesigned for 1999, that doesn't have to
apologize for anything, including its price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.5-liter V6 is neatly matched to the four-speed
transmission for performance. The ride was able to smooth over
Greater Boston's potholes without depriving the driver of a good
feel of the road.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned exterior caused one neighbor plus good friend
Matt at Irving's gas station to comment that they first thought
this was a Mercedes. That may not be what the folks at Honda/Acura
want to hear, but it's hardly a putdown, either, for the flagship
of this line.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping from the Acura back into our Camry _ not a shabby
performer in its own right _ was a further revelation that the
Acura people have moved ahead and gotten it right. ``It,'' in this
case, being the whole package.
</P>
<P>
   The RL was a rich Navy blue with a parchment leather interior.
It had the requisite heated leather seats, moonroof, adjustable
seats with memory that adjusted the whole car _ seats, wheel,
mirrors. The trunk-mounted CD changer coordinated well with both
the radio controls and steering wheel volume and track adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Both Acuras had an emergency brake pedal instead of a handle. To
release the TL's brake you just hit the pedal a second time. The RL
had a release lever low on the left side of the dash. Reaching for
it blindly, I managed to also hit the hood release, resulting in an
embarrassing pull-to-the-side-of-the-Expressway later to relatch
the hood.
</P>
<P>
   You could spend a half-dozen paragraphs listing the standard
equipment. Suffice it to say, everything you need _ and a lot you
probably don't _ is there. As with the TL, the only option is the
$2000 Acura Navigation System.
</P>
<P>
   With both cars, Acura is building a modern day Model T because
everything coming down the line is the same . . . except for the
color. It has to have a positive influence on quality control;
indeed, we found nothing out of sorts on either vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A Significant-Other comment from Mrs. G was simply that either
of these Acuras could park in her driveway anytime.
</P>
<P>
   Notable from the owner's manual: 20 pages dealing with proper
installation and restraints for children. It's recommended reading
for both parents and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Safety, with ``smart'' airbags, is a major feature of the RL
with two notable features. The system senses the size and position
of front seat pas-sengers and adjusts the deploy-ment speed to the
severity of thecrash.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the seven-sensors supposedly would recognize when a
child was in the front seat (a no-no in itself) and (worse) napping
against the door. In that case the side airbag would not deploy.
</P>
<P>
   Crashing, fortunately, is not encouraged on our test drives.
</P>
<P>
   Or yours.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the first ABC of driving.

BUSINESS FALLS IF SNOW DOESN'T 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much is written each year about the business of skiing. New
Englanders effect the same faintly paternalistic pride about the
ski industry they do about other colorful home-grown products:
codfish cakes, baked beans, cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   As to the latter, since my home lies on the edge of ``cranberry
country'' _ one of the state's largest agricultural products _ I
was somewhat discouraged one year to learn that Wisconsin's bog
country had outproduced Massachussetts for the first time in
history. The margin was not much, but there it was: one more thing
my home state was not first in any longer, not to mention the
diminution of ``King Cranberry'' here in my old Swamp Yankee home.
Over the years we'd lost clams, oysters, flounder, horse chestnuts,
and the shoe industry; here was one more sign of retreat for
southeastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to report that our cranberry crop has been topping
Wisconsin's for the last couple of years, but we're not over that
private little worry we harbor every fall.
</P>
<P>
   No, I have absolutely no association with cranberry growing,
except for the aesthetic, and so it doesn't really matter a whit
which region produces more berries. It all goes in the same sauce
and it's all put there by the same company, as far as I can see.
</P>
<P>
   Mix a bit of vodka with cranberry juice and it's called a Cape
Codder; how tragic to start having to call that wonderful cocktail
a Madison or maybe a Lake Woebegoner!
</P>
<P>
   Still, on one of those blue-gold October days when the water
harvest is going on, bogs brimming with that crimson tide of fruit
being trucked for market, it gives one a little glow of pride to
drive a visitor down Federal Furnace Highway to see one of the last
remaining agricultural spectacles in our state.
</P>
<P>
   People root for the home product, and I think New Englanders
feel that way about their skiing. Like cranberries, it is colorful,
haplessly tied to vagaries of climate, making it a lot like
agriculture. The crop, of course, is snow.
</P>
<P>
   When the bottom lines are crunched, this year will be a bit like
that year the Massachusetts cranberry harvest fell to Wisconsin's.
Except that, comparitively speaking, the Rocky Mountain ski areas
have not had much to crow about, either.
</P>
<P>
   After Christmas, the news of layoffs in the big resorts _ up to
15 percent of the work force _ appeared from nearly everywhere
except the Northwest, British Columbia, and Alberta, where the big
snow fell all season.
</P>
<P>
   And in New England, it won't be pretty. The snow that finally
started to fall from a heretofore constipated winter will not be
enough to make up for a very lackluster season.
</P>
<P>
   American Skiing Company, the Les Otten enterprise that looked so
dazzling as it came together _ nine resorts in New England and the
West, growing out of Maine's once-modest Sunday River _ is now
struggling to get over this hump. Two weeks ago, American Skiing
announced a net loss of $10.8 million on revenue of $109.5 million,
a worse loss than previously predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's any secret that Otten has been playing a
breathlessly high-risk, fast-growth game with tens of millions of
dollars being pumped into what Otten still believes can be the
largest winter recreation empire in North America.
</P>
<P>
   And, more than skiing and snowboarding is involved. As boomers
age, their legs weakening at the time their 401k's brim with cash,
the vision is to market high-end real estate in areas that offer so
many recreational and cultural activities that the business won't
be so dependent on weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long term,'' Otten told a New York Times financial reporter
last week, ``I don't think this is going to have a detrimental
effect to the company. In the short term, it (weather-related
financial setback) is something that we understand and expect will
happen from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   To speculate the economics past Otten's comment is far beyond
the depth of this English major. It does seem he has bet on a few
speculative notions, one of them being that if a winter resort is
attractive and active enough it can compete with the wildly growing
warm-weather cruise and golf industries. Another is that real
estate profits can outweigh short-term lift ticket revenue losses.
</P>
<P>
   Intrawest (Stratton) and Booth Creek (Cranmore, Loon, Waterville
Valley) are on variations of the same mission, but for the last 15
years in snow country the needle has been stuck at around 50
million US skier visits per year.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of told-you-so's in the wake of American
Skiing's bad news, mainly from those peculiarly crabbed souls who
would always rather see a wild swinger strike out than hit a home
run. But Otten is no newcomer to the ski business, and he's
obviously not surprised by a bad winter.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen next in the world of high-stakes skibiz is
anybody's guess. But with the last few years of huge improvements
in snow production, grooming, fast and comfortable lifts, a
guarantee of decent skiing with just a minimal cooperation from the
weather, there is no question that the big winners have been skiers
and snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for the latter in the last 10 years _ in the
development of terrain parks, halfpipes, on-slope board shops _ has
been nothing short of an amazing arms race.
</P>
<P>
   For all this, the sport owes the Ottens and Gillets _
entrepreneurs whose hearts and lives surely are as invested in
skiing as their money _ the same thanks it gives the Seiberts and
Schneiders, who got the snowball rolling a couple of generations
ago.

A GROWTH SPURT SAVED HUSKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ Their NCAA tournament ride was very much in
jeopardy of ending before a stunned, disbelieving sellout crowd of
more than 10,000 that had come to Gampel Pavilion last Sunday night
to watch No. 1 seed UConn, making its 11th consecutive tournament
appearance, dispatch No. 8 seed Xavier, a new kid on the tournament
block.
</P>
<P>
   But with 2:40 remaining in the game, it was Xavier that held a
6-point lead over a young Huskies team that had no trouble
defeating 16th seed St. Francis in Friday's first round, but was
having lots of trouble finding a way to rattle the Musketeers and
feisty point guard Nikki Kremer.
</P>
<P>
   ``UConn knows the way to San Jose,'' was one of the signs that
the Gampel faithful held up earlier in the evening, a reference to
the site of the women's Final Four. But as time wound down, it
seemed doubtful that the Huskies would even be packing their bags
for Cincinnati (Xavier's home city) for this weekend's Mideast
Regional semifinals and final.
</P>
<P>
   But UConn, with two freshmen, two sophomores, and one junior
(Shea Ralph) in its starting lineup and only one senior, Amy Duran,
receiving significant minutes, grew up in a hurry _ and just in the
nick of time.
</P>
<P>
   Down, 84-78, the Huskies scored the last 8 points of the game,
with freshman forward Tamika Williams converting a pair of foul
shots with 7.1 seconds on the board to overcome a Xavier team that
did all the right things for most of the game and just about all
the wrong things in crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't ready for spring break yet,'' said Ralph, ``but with
it being March Madness and all, you know it's one and done. I think
it was important that we won this game. It seems like that when
we've been in these situations before, we've kind of crumpled, with
everyone kind of looking at each other. We didn't do that this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   If UConn's low point was a first-half steal by Kremer from Big
East Player of the Year Svetlana Abrosimova that Kremer converted
into a 3-point bomb and 10-point lead, then its high point of the
game _ and season _ was its stirring comeback that set up
Saturday's game in Cincinnati against Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   UConn's grit, combined with two crucial Xavier turnovers and a
pair of missed free throws by Kremer with the score knotted at 84,
made the difference, but it's doubtful that Huskies coach Geno
Auriemma diagrammed the crucial winning sequence on his play-board.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kremer misses (she had been 8 for 8 at the foul line),
UConn called time. Shea took the first shot, a leaner into the lane
that wasn't close. Duran kept the ball alive with another fling
from under the backboard. The rebound came to Williams, who was
fouled as she shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to stay settled,'' said Williams, who carried the
Huskies down the stretch. Eleven of her team-high 19 points came in
the second half, including 8 in the final 7:02 and 4 in the last
two minutes. ``I just wanted to take my time, go through the
routine, bounce the ball, spin it, follow through, and put it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The first one was a perfect swish, the second a rim rattler to
make it 86-84, and Williams, who was also immense on the boards
with a game-high nine rebounds, had done something she had never
experienced in a game at any level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never made two free throws to win a game at the end like
this,'' she said. ``Maybe a last-second shot to win a game, but
never free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a Dayton, Ohio, native who knew a few players on the
Xavier team that was playing just its third NCAA Tournament game
ever, said the thought of returning to her home state never crossed
her mind when she stepped to the free throw line. ``I wasn't
thinking about anything but winning the game at the end,'' she
said, ``but now that we won, I think we have a lot to prove in
Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   But Big East champ UConn (28-4), which graduated stars Nykesha
Sales (an All-American) and Rita Williams from last year's 34-3
Elite Eight team, already has proven it can overcome adversity.
</P>
<P>
   It trailed Xavier by 10 twice in the second half. Its go-to
players, Abrosimova and Ralph, were a combined 12 for 28 from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   But freshman center Asjha Jones, like Williams, had a monster
second half, scoring all of her 12 points and hauling down five of
her six rebounds after the break. It all served to wear down Xavier
and the gallant, but tiring Kremer, who played the entire 40
minutes, but ran out of gas at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that it had to be your night,'' said UConn associate
head coach Chris Dailey, ``when an 80 percent free throw shooter
(Kremer) misses and a 60 percent free throw shooter (Williams)
makes them.''
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma paid tribute to both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame we both couldn't go. It's a shame they can't go,
too,'' he said. ``That's a great team we played, but our defense
came up big at the end and we made a couple of big shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game for us was like going up a hill and not gaining.
Every time we made a mistake, they took advantage and they never
gave us a chance to go on a run. I was really proud of how we
battled at the end. Sometimes you just have to hang around and see
how it comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, it all came out just fine for the Huskies, who at
least know the way to Cincinnati.

A FEW BIG BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Citibank Chief Executive Officer John Reed had a
vision. He saw a day when Citibank would take a fee on virtually
every imaginable commercial transaction, while at the same time
offering virtually every imaginable financial service, and taking a
fee on that as well.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Citibank, the technology needed to realize
Reed's vision was not then operational.
</P>
<P>
   It is now. And it will only get better, smarter, and more
powerful. High technology is transforming financial services before
our eyes. By the time the transformation is complete, which should
be no longer than two decades, it is likely that the United States
will have six or eight financial supermarkets, once called banks,
that will dominate the global financial system.
</P>
<P>
   That's what all these deals are about. The merger of Citibank
and Traveler's into Citigroup is about building the foundation for
a financial supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of Wells Fargo-Norwest is about building the
foundation for a financial supermarket. The much-whispered
combination of Chase Manhattan and a major brokerage firm is about
building the foundation for a financial supermarket. Technology
requires these combinations and is consolidating the financial
services industry with breath-taking speed.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, not so long ago, when the banking business was
about relationships. Press coverage of Fleet Bank's acquisition of
BankBoston was heavy on the ``relationship'' angle. There were long
takeouts on the relationship between Fleet Bank CEO Terry Murray
and BankBoston CEO Chad Gifford. There were stories about how the
top managers of the two banks would ``get along'' with one another.
These stories were no doubt true, but they are beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that what will separate winners from losers in the
brave new world of banking and financial services is technology.
Fleet Bank Chief Executive Officer Terry Murray didn't acquire
Shawmut Bank and BankBoston because he wanted to have a
relationship with anyone. He bought them both because Fleet needed
Shawmut's and BankBoston's financial resources to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet needs those resources because the technology it needs to
remain competitive is really expensive _ hundreds of millions of
dollars expensive _ and some of it won't work well at first. But if
Fleet doesn't have the means to purchase this new technology and
use it, then it will fall behind some other bank that does. And in
very short order Fleet will watch its best customers migrate to
that bigger, technologically superior bank.
</P>
<P>
   Take an every day example, the cellular phone. Use it now and
you can make a phone call. Use it with wireless modems, Jini
technology, and voice recognition software, and suddenly you have a
secure super-computer, capable of conducting thousands of financial
transactions in less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   These technologies will be widely available by the end of the
year 2003 (Jini software is already available, as are wireless
modems). High-end financial services customers will own them. As a
result, they will have access to their money and financial markets
at any time, in any place, regardless of whether they are climbing
the Himalayas or driving to work on the expressway. The bank that
does not have the technology to communicate with these customers
will lose them. The bank that does will keep them.
</P>
<P>
   Technology makes possible banking without boundaries. John
Reed's new vision is that Citigroup will someday have one billion
customers all around the globe. It will make money on customer fees
(like ATM charges, credit cards, checking services, mortgages,
personal loans, brokerage services, insurance, and the like). It
will make money on a host of financial services that it provides to
corporations and nation-states. Most important, it will make money
on its databases.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, aided by high technology, will have real-time
information on the purchasing patterns of hundreds or millions of
customers _ sorted, mixed, and matched so that anyone who ever
bought a box of golf balls or Microsoft software (and everything in
between) can be, as they say, ``captured'' at the touch of a few
keystrokes. How much do you suppose Titleist or Bill Gates would
pay for that information? The short answer is a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Banks like Fleet Financial and Chase Manhattan will either have
the technology to compete in this environment or they won't. In
order to acquire and continually upgrade these technologies, they
must have vast financial resources. Which is why mergers and
acquisitions in financial services will continue apace.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Bank's acquisition of BankBoston marks the end of the
nation's oldest independent bank. But it is just the beginning of
what will be a massive consolidation of the financial services
industry. Terry Murray has always understood the basic truth of his
business. It is this: Get big, get wired, or get bought.

BIG FIRMS LOOK TO STARTUPS IN SCRAMBLE TO CATCH TECH WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Redstone Communications, founded just 18 months ago, has yet to
ship a single product. But it has ideas and a new Internet switch,
which is what German telecommunications giant Siemens AG is after.
Siemens is expected to announce plans to buy Redstone for a
half-billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone, of Westford, is the third telecommunications start-up
in Massachusetts Siemens has purchased this month. Siemens launched
its $1 billion spending spree in an attempt to enter the market for
data networking. And Siemens is not alone. Since the beginning of
the year, three other start-ups have announced deals collectively
valued at nearly $700 million in cash and stock while a fourth,
Kenan Systems Inc., of Cambridge, Mass., received a surprising
$1.45 billion in stock from Lucent Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telecommunications is the most exciting industry on earth,''
said James Dolce Jr., the 36-year-old cofounder and chief executive
of Redstone, who declined to discuss the financial terms of the
deal. ``With the Internet changing our life, the changes in
telecommunications are tantamount to the next Industrial Revolution
_ and we are just scratching the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   For companies like Redstone, where more than a dozen employees
will reportedly become instant millionaires, the latest gold rush
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The five founders of the firm
will divide up more than $140 million, according to sources close
to the deal. The venture capitalists who saw promise in the
technology will also profit handsomely _ Waltham-based Battery
Ventures, which invested $4 million in second-round financing six
months ago, will reap $30 million when the deal closes in the next
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For Dolce, the Siemens deal is his third in a decade. He sold a
small data communications company in Providence in 1989 before
moving to the Boston area and cofounding Arris Networks Inc. He and
his partners sold that company after six months to Cascade
Communications Corp. for $175 million, just before Cascade was
acquired by Ascend Communications Inc. (Ascend, in turn, was
purchased by Lucent for $19.6 billion in stock in January).
</P>
<P>
   Companies are scrambling to acquire switching products using the
latest technology to meet the mushrooming demand for data
networking created by the popularity of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   These high-speed devices, which often sell for a fraction of the
current voice-only switches, are sold to major local and
long-distance telephone carriers around the world, and scores of
smaller independent phone companies and Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   These firms then sell services to business and residential
customers who often are clamoring for easier, cheaper, and faster
access to ever-higher volumes of Internet voice, data, and video
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now a lot of the big companies are simply scared if they
don't buy some of these start-ups,'' said Dave Rickey, president of
San Diego-based Applied Micro Circuits Corp., which is spending
$120 million in stock to acquire Cimaron Communications Corp. of
Andover, a 14-month-old supplier of telecommunications chips used
in fiber-optic networks.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the Cimaron deal, two Bay State venture capital
companies, Matrix Partners and Greylock Management, will split
about $63 million in Applied Micro stock, after investing just
$4.25 million in Cimaron in January 1998, according to Ram
Sudireddy, president and cofounder of Cimaron.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it was simply time to market _ an opportunity to be
part of a bigger company where we could go after larger markets
together,'' Sudireddy said. Sudireddy said his company expects to
have $3 million in revenue this year, escalating to $15 million in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   And while other domestic companies pan Boston's northwest
suburbs seeking golden start-up nuggets, European
telecommunications companies have also staked big claims in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens, by far the most aggressive, has formed Unisphere
Solutions Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary based in Burlington,
Mass. focused on data-networking and Internet communications. At
Unisphere's core are a trio of Massachusetts companies, led by
Redstone along with Argon Networks Inc. of Littleton and Castle
Networks Inc. of Westford _ two companies that Siemens acquired
earlier this month for $550 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the buyers like Siemens realize that unless they do
something innovative and relatively quickly, they will be left out
of the telecommunications market that will be worth many billions
of dolars worldwide,'' Dolce said.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens, headquarted in Munich, along with Paris-based Alcatel
S.A. and Ericcson AB of Sweden are turning to US telecommunications
start-up companies in Greater Boston and Silicon Valley to expand
into new markets that combine voice and data to serve the exploding
Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   Ericcson, in anticipation of making some data networking
start-up acquisitions, has also established a US headquarters in
Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   All three European companies are following a path blazed nearly
five years ago by such leading North American companies as Lucent,
Cisco Systems Inc., Northern Telecom Inc., and 3Com Corp. These
firms all decided it was ultimately less expensive and faster to
acquire promising technologies instead of developing new products
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   And while some critics claim the European giants are starting
their buying sprees rather late, they have a major advantage over
their US counterparts in foreign markets. Siemens/Unisphere, with a
worldwide sales force of 26,000 people in 141 countries, can sell
easily recoup its hefty investment in Redstone's technology if it
has made the right bet.

WALSH IS BACK WHERE HE BELONGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ He came to his first National Football League meeting
20 years ago, a virtual unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for the next decade, Bill Walsh dominated the NFL,
bringing the San Francisco 49ers to new heights and establishing
the franchise was one of the best in the history of the game. He
won three Super Bowls as a coach, and the team he left behind won
two more.
</P>
<P>
   Then Walsh wandered for a decade. Several years on NBC
television as an analyst. A few more as head coach at Stanford. And
the last few writing books and working as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But now he has come full cycle. He is back to recreate what he
started in San Francisco. He is the 49ers general manager again,
nearing age 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so good to see him back,'' said Mike Holmgren, a
disciple of Walsh, who went on to win a Super Bowl in Green Bay and
is the new Seattle Seahawks coach. ``I was sitting up the front of
the room the other day in a competition committee meeting and
looked out into this sea of faces, and there he was. Bill Walsh. It
stunned me for a second, and then it made me feel good. He needs
this. This challenge. If he has the energy to do it, then it will
be good for him and San Francisco. It's a lot tougher now to get it
done than it was when he came in before.''
</P>
<P>
   This notion was seconded by Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis
Green, who like Holmgren, got his NFL start under Walsh with those
wonderful 49ers teams of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for Bill,'' Green said. ``It's going to be fun to
see what he does this time. It's a new world now with the salary
cap, free agency, and all of the other stuff. It will be a tough
challenge for him, but he's always been a guy that found a way to
get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   George Seifert, who followed Walsh as coach of the 49ers, won
two Super Bowls himself, and is now the head coach in Carolina,
also is pleased for his old boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs something like this,'' said Seifert. ``This will be
good for him and San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh returned to these meetings, and all of the memories of the
past, with a heavy heart. His wife, Geri, suffered a serious stroke
about a month ago and just recently came home from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get up early and get into work,'' said Walsh, trying to get
his groove back. ``Then I go home early to be with her. It is such
a difficult thing she is going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, already in the Hall of Fame, finds himself in the midst
of a bizarre situation.
</P>
<P>
   The man who hired him, Eddie DeBartolo, has been pushed into
exile by his family and the league. Team president Carmen Policy
and general manager Dwight Clark have packed up and left for
Cleveland and the expansion Browns. Former player personnel
director Vince Cerrato has been let go.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh has returned to a ghost ship and a foundering franchise
that appears to be on the way down after an unparalleled run of
success over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we had to try to do is stabilize some
things,'' said Walsh. ``We had to let a bunch of veteran plays go
because of salary cap problems. I tried to make deals for those
guys so we can get some draft choices and start to rebuild this
thing all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a lot of help on defense. The offense has to carry us
next season if we are going to be any good. We still have the
people on offense that can do it. Defensively, we have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh says Jerry Rice, the greatest receiver of all time, will
be rested and kept out of practices. Ditto for aging pass rusher
Charles Haley, who returned for two playoff games last year. ``We
won't wear out Rice and Haley during the week,'' Walsh said. ``If
they are rested, they can still give us a lot on Sunday. And, we
will not rush Bryant Young back. That was a devastating knee injury
he suffered. There is no reason to bring him back too soon. We will
make sure we are overly cautious with him. He has been one of the
best defensive linemen in the league and that is the area where we
need the most help right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh has no coaching ambitions. He sees himself as a source of
support to Steve Mariucci, who has had an impressive start in his
first two years with the Niners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be around practices, in camp and during the season,''
said Walsh, ``but I'll be around the edges. I won't be with the
coaches. If I see something I will speak up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I came back. I feel I can help this team get back
to the top. It is going to take some doing, but it can be done. I
enjoy being back. When I left, I left too soon. I didn't see it
then, but I know it now.''

 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A is for Acura.
</P>
<P>
   B is for bargain.
</P>
<P>
   C is for car, but you wouldn't expect A and B to add up to an
Acura.
</P>
<P>
   But one Acura fits this formula.
</P>
<P>
   After having the privilege of spending two weeks with a pair of
Acuras, first a sporty/luxury 1999 3.2 TL, then the 3.5 RL luxury
sedan, I proclaim the 3.2 TL a bargain. Even though it carries a
price tag of $28,405 (including destination charge), it compares
favorably with cars selling for up to $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Acura calls it a ``performance luxury sedan,'' a bit grander
than my description of it as a highly desirable four-door sports
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   This was one car I really would have liked to hold onto when the
time came to turn it back.
</P>
<P>
   But, before giving it up, I spun by an Acura dealer just to
confirm that the price, as they say, was right.
</P>
<P>
   It was _ and all but one of the TLs on this lot had ``sold''
stickers on them, proving that buyers were seeing the same thing I
was: lots of car for the money.
</P>
<P>
   From the responsive 3.2-liter, 24-valve, VTEC V6 coupled with a
four-speed automatic with a Sequential SportShift (you can use it
strictly as an automatic or swing the selector lever to another
gate and use itas a semimanual) to the 16-inchtires, it was a
pleasure to drivethis car.
</P>
<P>
   This all-new for '99 TL is the descendant of the Vigor and the
previous TL in the Acura line. Andit's the best of the bunch.
Morepower, better rear-seat legroom,a quieter riding experience
andlower price make this more car for less money.
</P>
<P>
   The only available option _ the Acura Navigation System ($2,000)
_ was a hoot. Three programmed trips brought us:
</P>
<P>
   1. Directly to a restaurant at Marina Bay in Quincy, Mass. Not a
big deal, but this was our first venture off Quincy Shore Drive and
the voice of our ``navigator'' brought us directly to the door we
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   2. To Portsmouth, N.H., without missing a turn. On the return
trip, the ``voice'' demanded a left turn as we (er, I) blithely
drove by the on-ramp to Interstate 95, earning a carful of cheerful
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   3. Delivered us to the wrong end of Hanover Avenue, a tiny,
one-way alleyway off Hanover Street in Boston's North End.
</P>
<P>
   Add in the other amenities _ power everything, heated leather
seats, single-CD player/Bose five-speaker sound system, electric
moonroof _ and you've got quite a package.
</P>
<P>
   The responsive ride was appropriate for the car, the legroom was
fine in back, and all in our party of critics-for-a-day fell in
love with the car . . . right back to its silver-tipped dual
exhaust extensions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
RL as in really luxurious
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A is for act _ because the TL should have been a tough act for
the 3.5 RL to follow.
</P>
<P>
   B, however, is for a bonafide, as in bonafide luxury sedan,
which the RL is.
</P>
<P>
   C is for cost. This is a $41,900 MSRP (plus $455 destination
charge) luxury sedan, redesigned for 1999, that doesn't have to
apologize for anything, including its price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.5-liter V6 is neatly matched to the four-speed
transmission for performance. The ride was able to smooth over
Greater Boston's potholes without depriving the driver of a good
feel of the road.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned exterior caused one neighbor plus good friend
Matt at Irving's gas station to comment that they first thought
this was a Mercedes. That may not be what the folks at Honda/Acura
want to hear, but it's hardly a putdown, either, for the flagship
of this line.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping from the Acura back into our Camry _ not a shabby
performer in its own right _ was a further revelation that the
Acura people have moved ahead and gotten it right. ``It,'' in this
case, being the whole package.
</P>
<P>
   The RL was a rich Navy blue with a parchment leather interior.
It had the requisite heated leather seats, moonroof, adjustable
seats with memory that adjusted the whole car _ seats, wheel,
mirrors. The trunk-mounted CD changer coordinated well with both
the radio controls and steering wheel volume and track adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Both Acuras had an emergency brake pedal instead of a handle. To
release the TL's brake you just hit the pedal a second time. The RL
had a release lever low on the left side of the dash. Reaching for
it blindly, I managed to also hit the hood release, resulting in an
embarrassing pull-to-the-side-of-the-Expressway later to relatch
the hood.
</P>
<P>
   You could spend a half-dozen paragraphs listing the standard
equipment. Suffice it to say, everything you need _ and a lot you
probably don't _ is there. As with the TL, the only option is the
$2000 Acura Navigation System.
</P>
<P>
   With both cars, Acura is building a modern day Model T because
everything coming down the line is the same . . . except for the
color. It has to have a positive influence on quality control;
indeed, we found nothing out of sorts on either vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A Significant-Other comment from Mrs. G was simply that either
of these Acuras could park in her driveway anytime.
</P>
<P>
   Notable from the owner's manual: 20 pages dealing with proper
installation and restraints for children. It's recommended reading
for both parents and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Safety, with ``smart'' airbags, is a major feature of the RL
with two notable features. The system senses the size and position
of front seat pas-sengers and adjusts the deploy-ment speed to the
severity of thecrash.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the seven-sensors supposedly would recognize when a
child was in the front seat (a no-no in itself) and (worse) napping
against the door. In that case the side airbag would not deploy.
</P>
<P>
   Crashing, fortunately, is not encouraged on our test drives.
</P>
<P>
   Or yours.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the first ABC of driving.

<HEADLINE>
LET'S MAKE SURE MICROSOFT GETS THE WORD ON LINUX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The free Linux operating system has been in the news a lot
lately.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, IBM said it was forming a strategic partnership with
Red Hat Software to deliver IBM computers running Red Hat's Linux
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, industry leader Oracle is shipping a version of its
database for the free operating system. Many pundits are now openly
wondering if Linux might some day replace, or at least stand
alongside Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the things that has held back Linux from broad
acceptance is the lack of mainstream desktop applications _
programs like Microsoft Word, Intuit's Quicken, and Adobe's
PhotoShop. None of these programs run on Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Some Linux enthusiasts say the lack of mainstream applications
is actually a good thing. The lack of commercial programs, they
say, is stimulating the development of free word processors,
spreadsheets, and desktop publishing systems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are a number of commercial vendors that are
making applications for Linux. A program called Star Office,
bundled with some versions of Linux, provides a rudimentary word
processor, spreadsheet, and drawing program. Meanwhile, Corel has
developed a Word Perfect program for Linux and is even giving the
program away on the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But for many users, Star Office and Word Perfect aren't good
enough. Many businesses and universities have standardized on
Microsoft Word and Excel, and they can't seriously consider putting
Linux on a person's desk until Linux runs Microsoft's applications.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, while I was a guest on a Boston radio show ``The
Connection,'' I mentioned off-handedly that Microsoft was exploring
the possibility of releasing a Microsoft Office for Linux. The
comment was reprinted widely. Many people observed that it would
make good sense for the programmers in Microsoft's Office Group to
explore Linux. After all, if the government prevails in its current
antitrust case against Microsoft, the company might soon be split
into two, one selling applications, the other selling operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Word on Linux would give the applications publishing Microsoft a
foothold in the world's next major operating system. Meanwhile,
Word for Linux would have a crushing impact on the other Linux word
processors and spreadsheets: Star Office and Word Perfect could
never win the market share battle if Microsoft Word were available
on the Linux platform.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, my comments gave the wrong impression. According to John
Duncan, a product manager for the Microsoft Office suite of
software, ``We don't have plans to offer a Linux version of Office.
There is no development effort under way.''
</P>
<P>
   I based my radio comments on the fact that many individuals
inside Microsoft run Linux on their home computers. Even though
Microsoft has not formally committed to the platform, many
Microsoft employees have made their own commitments with their time
and money.
</P>
<P>
   When I spoke with Duncan, he said Microsoft is not developing
Office for Linux because ``customers haven't asked for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course that's nonsense. Lots of Linux users want Microsoft
Office on their desktop. Nevertheless, says Duncan, Microsoft
hasn't heard an outcry for Linux in its surveys, its usability
studies, or in discussions with its major customers.
</P>
<P>
   Linux users now have an opportunity to change Microsoft's mind.
Duncan has set up a special e-mail address for people who have

HOLLYWOOD TAKING UP THE CAUSE OF AFGHAN WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The weather has not been cooperating with Mavis
Leno's cause.
</P>
<P>
   First a snowstorm kept her from testifying before a
congressional subcommittee in Washington. Then a rainstorm made her
late to a related appointment in her hometown of Los Angeles. But
no force of nature has been able to stop her from working the
phones and her circle of celebrity friends.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Feminist Majority Foundation's campaign to give
women in war-torn Afghanistan the right to work, the right to
attend school, and literally the right to walk outside without fear
of stoning, Leno is asking Hollywood to focus on a real-life drama
with no pat ending. For months now, she has been talking up anyone
who is anyone about human rights abuses under the Taliban regime,
hoping that attention here will bring relief there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told every celebrity I've talked to that their wattage is
going to add that much more light to the issue, that much more
pressure . . .,'' Leno said. ``I want us to say to the world:
They're going to have to find someone else to pick on.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno, relatively new to political activism, conceded that many
Hollywood types had not heard of the Taliban before she called. Now
she's got A-list involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The movement to restore human rights to women in Afghanistan has
swept Hollywood, not quite replacing a free Tibet or AIDS research,
but becoming the cause of the moment among the celebrity crowd.
Leno and her husband, ``Tonight Show'' host Jay Leno, have used
their names, their connections, and $100,000 of their own money to
make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   The confirmed guest list for a dinner buffet she is co-hosting
for the Feminist Majority Foundation on March 29 runs from singer
Paula Abdul to actress Renee Zellweger, with dozens more such as
Melanie Griffith, Wynona Judd, and Heather Locklear in between. The
entertainment will include celebrity readings of letters from
Afghan women, thanking Hollywood women for their involvement. In
turn, Leno called the actresses' need to assist Afghan women
``primal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them have expressed a deep level of commitment; others
were already involved in our organization,'' said Leno, a writer
who grew up in California and joined the Feminist Majority board
just months after the Islamist movement seized the Afghan capital
of Kabul in the fall of 1996. ``But who can predict what people
will do? If you had told me I would be deeply involved in foreign
affairs issues in the Mideast 10 years ago, I'd have laughed. But
when you hear the specifics of the cases, you don't have an
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno understands that Hollywood alone can bring only so much
heat to the issue. She needs more widespread support to keep the
Clinton administration from recognizing the Taliban as a legitimate
government. So she recently outlined the situation in a letter to
Dear Abby. The response from readers was so great that it jammed
the lines at the telemarketing firm the Feminist Majority had
hired.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ``take action'' kits have been mailed, with half of
the requested $2 donation going to help Afghan women in refugee
camps and half going toward the campaign to raise awareness of
their plight. For the money, contributors receive names of US and
UN officials to contact and a swatch of mesh, the small opening
through which Afghan women, forced to wear head-to-toe garments
called burqas outdoors, must see and breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here in the entertainment capital of the world, for
heaven's sake, and we decided to mobilize the most famous women in
the world to speak out against gender apartheid in Afghanistan,''
said Kathy Spillar, national coordinator of the Feminist Majority
in Los Angeles. ``We're coming together to say you can't treat
women like this anywhere in the world and get away with it. . . .
We're drawing the line in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports coming out of Afghanistan and the refugee camps in
bordering Pakistan depict a female population imprisoned in its own
homes. Women can no longer go outside unless accompanied by a male
relative. Others have allegedly been raped by Taliban soldiers, or
forced into a sort of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Once university professors and government employees, women were
ousted overnight from the workplace. Girls were sent home from
school, and their education was outlawed. Women were ordered to
give up their medical practices at the same time women were
forbidden from being examined by male doctors. The result,
advocates say, is that 70 percent of Afghanistan's population _ a
high percentage due to the tens of thousands of men killed during
the civil war _ is without health care, opportunity, or even food
in households headed by war widows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of women who are starving to death,'' said
Zieba Shorish-Shamley, who has visited the refugee camps as
president of the Washington-based Women's Alliance for Peace and
Human Rights in Afghanistan. ``Some are committing suicide,
drinking caustic soda, a household substance, that takes them three
days to die. Others jump out of buildings to escape seeing their
own children dying of starvation in front of their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are wiping out a 5,000-year-old culture,'' she added.
``What the Taliban is doing is they are making genocide in many
forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Shorish-Shamley said she is grateful for Leno's help, for
Hollywood's help, for anyone's help in restoring women's rights in
Afghanistan. With more than 130 women's and human rights groups now
involved worldwide _ and a US secretary of state and first lady who
have condemned the violations against women in Afghanistan _
Shorish-Shamley described herself as skeptically hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening to women in Afghanistan is despicable,''
said Alyse Nelson, a spokeswoman for the President's Interagency
Council on Women. ``It's not just rhetoric. We're following up with
programs and policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno and other activists take some of the credit for the
attention being paid in State Department cubicles and corporate
boardrooms. Petitions have been sent to Washington. Demonstrations
have been held coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   When Southern California-based Unocal Corp. was leading a
consortium that planned an $8 billion energy pipeline that would
traverse Afghanistan, Leno spoke against it at the annual
stockholders meeting. The company, also under pressure from low
world oil prices and concern about the Taliban's sheltering of
terror suspect Osama bin Laden, withdrew from the pipeline in
December.
</P>
<P>
   This week, under a deal brokered by the United Nations, warring
factions in Afghanistan agreed to the creation of a coalition
government that would include all of the political forces. Previous
agreements have fallen apart. Shorish-Shamley said she is also
concerned that women will be kept from any peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country can't get back on its feet with these women living
inside their houses,'' said Leno. ``They will have to soften their
stance or the country won't survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is plain,'' she added. ``I don't care if the
Taliban stays in power, or if some faction I haven't heard of comes
into power. All I want is for the human rights of these women to be
restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Leno excused herself. She had more calls to make, more
politicians to lobby, more celebrities to contact for support.

BEING AT TWO PLACES AT ONCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you use a computer both at home and at work, then you
probably know the difficulty of keeping the two machines
synchronized.
</P>
<P>
   Your computer at work has one set of applications programs, your
computer at home has another. Or you might take an important file
home to work on, then forget to bring that file back to work the
next day. Or you might simply have a better printer at work then at
home; wouldn't it be nice to be able to start a big document
printing while you are at home, and then have it ready when you
show up at work?
</P>
<P>
   One way to manage this complexity is to put both your computers
on the Net, and then use Internet programs like FTP (File Transfer
Protocol) to move your files around. Another technique is to use
file sharing; I know of one MIT professor who accesses his office
hard drive from home.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, both of these techniques work best if you have a
high-speed link, full-time Internet connection on both sides. For
example, you might have a cable modem at home, and your company
might have an expensive ``leased-line'' or ``T1'' Internet
connection. Without the full-time availability, you are likely to
find yourself in one location and your files trapped at the other.
And without the high speed, you might find yourself waiting half an
hour or longer to download a large PowerPoint file before you
actually work on it.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach to sharing information between the home and
office is to use a remote control program. This software lets you
call your home or office computer over telephone lines and take it
over from somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   As the name implies, remote control software lets a remote user
take full control of the computer on which it is running, which is
called the ``host.'' When the remote user moves the mouse or types
on the remote keyboard, the remote control software simulates these
actions on the host computer.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that is shown on the host computer's screen gets sent
over the telephone lines to the remote. Although this sounds
somewhat awkward, the software is remarkably easy to use. The
remote user can run a word processor, read e-mail, use a
spreadsheet, and even re-boot the host computer if something goes
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Remote control software is also surprisingly fast. That's
because the programs don't send the application software or the
documents across the phone lines _ they just send the changes on
the screen. In practice, this means that you can use a fairly
obsolete computer, like a Pentium 100, to dial into an ultrafast
Pentium III, run sophisticated financial modeling software, and
you'll see Pentium III performance.
</P>
<P>
   There are limitations, of course: scrolling through large
amounts of data can take a long time, and don't expect to play any
games over the modem. Both scrolling and games require being able
to send a lot of data from the computer to the screen, and that is
something that remote control software doesn't do very quickly,
because all of the data needs to be sent over the phone line.
</P>
<P>
   For small organizations and home users, remote control software
can be a low-cost approach to networking. Instead of going through
the hassle of setting up a file server, network printers, and
sophisticated dial-up software, you can simply leave a copy of a
remote control program running on an office PC or Mac. Then, home
users can simply call up the machine, access its files, run its
applications, print, and hang up.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular remote control program on the Macintosh is
Timbuktu Pro, which is now sold by Farallon. It costs around $140.
Timbuktu is also an easy way to remotely manage a Mac that's locked
away in a closet somewhere and is being used as a Web server or a
file server: besides connecting over a modem, you can also connect
over a local area network using Appletalk.
</P>
<P>
   On Windows, the two leading remote access programs are Compaq's
CarbonCopy32 ($130) and Symantec's pcANYWHERE32 ($140). Traveling
Software has its own remote access program called Remote DeskLink
($50), which is also built into LapLink Professional ($140). All of
these programs offer remote control by telephone, over a local area
network, or over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   All of these programs offer the basic remote access features:
remote control, remote printing, and file transfer. LapLink
Professional has the most additional features. When you print with
LapLink, you can print on either the local machine or the remote
machine. LapLink is optimized for Windows 98, it will work with
Traveling Software's proprietary USB cable (useful for
presentations), and it will support simultaneous connections by
modem and over the network.
</P>
<P>
   But I found that CarbonCopy was the easiest program of the three
to use. For example, you can just click a button on the program's
user interface and set CarbonCopy to automatically run when your
computer boots, so you don't need to remember to launch it yourself
before going to work each morning.
</P>
<P>
   All of the programs reviewed here allow you to set up a user
name and password to control access to your machine. This is an
important step to remember: if you don't put a user name and
password on your remote access program, then anybody who calls up
your computer will get full access to all of your files! The
programs also let you encrypt data that is sent between the remote
computer and the server.

SLEEP STUDY URGES SLUMBER-ONE PRIORITY  
 HEART DISEASE ALERT SOUNDS FOR MINORITIES  
 SEX AFTER MENOPAUSE? WHY NOT, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   &UR; Sleep study urges slumber-one priority
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bedroom should be just for sleep and sex.
</P>
<P>
   That's the advice researchers offer in a study on how older
Americans can overcome insomnia. The report found that behavioral
therapy works slightly better and more enduringly than sleeping
pills, and combining the two is even better, at least for the short
term.
</P>
<P>
   So, say the authors, instead of just popping a pill, go to bed
only when you're sleepy. Don't watch TV or read in your bed or
bedroom. What's more, check your worries at the door. Head to
another part of the house when you can't fall asleep, or fall back
asleep, within 15 minutes. And get up at the same time every
morning, regardless of how much sleep you got the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers came up with that advice after running tests on
50 men and 28 women, all of whom were 55 or older and had
experienced insomnia for six months or longer. All had suffered
from their inability to sleep, finding that they were overtired,
could not function well, or saw their mood sour.
</P>
<P>
   Subjects were then divided into four groups getting eight weeks
of behavioral therapy, treatment with the sleeping pill temazepam,
combined behavioral and drug therapy, or a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Results were best among those who got the combined treatment,
nearly 64 percent of whom saw a reduction in time spent trying to
fall asleep. The reduction was 55 percent in the behavior-alone
group, nearly 47 percent among those getting the sleeping pill, and
17 percent among those who received an empty pill. Over a two-year
follow-up, however, the benefits of drug treatment declined
substantially.
</P>
<P>
   The study, in the current Journal of the American Medical
Association, was closely followed partly because insomnia is so
widespread among seniors, affecting up to one in four. But its
results apply to people of various ages. It also offers what is
believed to be the best comparison of different treatments, and it
shows how effective it can be to change simple behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Heart disease alert sounds for minorities
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Changing behavior also is critical to prevent heart disease, and
a a study suggests those changes should come earlier than we
thought, particularly for many minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The report, in JAMA, compared cardiovascular risk factors among
more than 7,000 blacks, Mexican-Americans, and whites age 6 to 24.
It found that blacks and Mexican-Americans were at substantially
greater risk than whites, apparently because they were poorer and
less likely to engage in behaviors known to reduce the risk of
heart disease, such as eating healthily and exercising.
</P>
<P>
   The study suggests that ``heart disease prevention really needs
to begin at very young ages, as early as kindergarten,'' says
Marilyn A. Winkleby, the lead author and a senior researcher at the
Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention in California.
</P>
<P>
   While many in minority communities know a lot about their
increased risk of breast cancer and AIDS, Winkleby says, they
generally are not as aware of a greater risk of heart disease,
which is the leading cause of death in America. Genetics may play a
small role in raising the risk of blacks and Mexican-Americans, she
adds, ``but the bulk of it is lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sex after menopause? Why not, study says
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's widely believed in America that menopause spells the
beginning of the end for women when it comes to sex.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey debunks that myth. A majority of women age 50 to
65 say their sexual desire is as robust as before menopause, and
some say it's more so. The reasons, the women told pollsters, range
from fewer child-rearing responsibilities to no worries about
getting pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first study that really asked women their views
about menopause and sex,'' says Dr. Donnica L. Moore, a
gynecologist in New Jersey who chairs an educational campaign that
commissioned the survey. The poll, which involved 1,001 menopausal
women, was paid for by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which makes the
nation's most popular hormone-replacement therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want women to look forward to menopause,'' Moore adds.
``It's the beginning of the last third of their lives.''

JACOBSON PUTS HEAT ON REYNOLDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Jon Jacobson, a big Boston money manager who normally avoids
the spotlight, is going public to turn up the heat on managers of
Reynolds Metals Co. and to boost their slumping stock.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson's $1.8 billion hedge fund, Highfields Capital
Management, disclosed its 5.5 percent interest in the maker of
Reynolds Wrap Wednesday and detailed a behind-the-scenes dispute
now sure to spill into the company's annual meeting May 20.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson was the star stock picker who produced huge returns at
Harvard Management Corp., investor of Harvard University's $13
billion endowment, before leaving to start Highfields Capital last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Reynolds Metals stock is by far the most controversial
investment Highfields has made to date. In a regulatory filing, the
firm said Reynolds managers weren't ``fully committed'' to
maximizing the value of the company and should retain investment
bankers to look into their options, including a sale or a spin-off
of some units.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds executives were not immediately available to comment
Wednesday and Highfields officials declined to comment. Reynolds
stock rose 8 percent after the news, gaining 3 1/2 to 47.
</P>
<P>
   Highfields has become one of the largest investors in Reynolds.
Wellington Management Co. of Boston was the largest shareholder
with a 10 percent interest in the company, as of Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Highfields, the second-largest Boston hedge fund behind Jeff
Vinik's Vinik Asset Management, has tended to invest in large
stocks tangled in special situtations. Telecom Italia, the phone
company that whetted the merger interest of Olivetti, was by far
the firm's largest holding at the end of 1998, accounting for 17.7
percent of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Philips Electronics, which made a bid for VLSI Technology, and
Mobil Corp., which agreed to sell itself to Exxon, were other big
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson has always had a taste for concentrated investments,
which magnifies the success and failure of a stockpicker's
selections. That helped explain his annualized returns of 42.7
percent over his last three years at Harvard Management, which gave
Highfields $500 million to run.
</P>
<P>
   Highfields representatives first spoke with Reynolds managers on
Feb. 16 to discuss the company's performance and strategic options,
according to the documents filed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated the same day, they asked Reynolds to include a
shareholder proposal in proxy material for the company's annual
meeting. The proposal would request that the company hire bankers,
explore alternatives, and form a committee of outside directors to
manage the process.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, based in Richmond, rejected the request for a written
proxy proposal but said Highfields officials could make their case
in person at the annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, Reynolds directors amended the terms of its
antitakeover shareholders rights plan. The company said the changes
adjusted the plan to conform with court decisions and current
practices in similar plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rights under the plan become exercisable if any shareholder buys
or makes a tender offer for 15 percent of all Reynolds shares.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds is a well-known aluminum producer but also operates a
packaging business responsible for its well-known household foils
and other products.
</P>
<P>
   As a stock, Reynolds has been a mediocre performer. The shares
are down 40 percent from a high reached in May 1997 and trade for
less than their value of a decade ago. Part of the problem: A huge
glut of aluminum has depressed the commodity's value.
</P>
<P>
   In its regulatory filing, Highfields said Reynolds stock traded
at roughly half the value the company's two leading business units
would command if they were split up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The status quo has not and is unlikely to unlock this value,''
Highfields said in its papers. Reynolds told the SEC that such
estimates were ``potentially misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds had hired Merrill Lynch to conduct a ``portfolio
review'' of its businesses in 1996. Directors acted on Merrill's
proposal and later divested its North American can business and
other ``noncore'' operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Requiring the board to repeat the process with the assistance
of other or additional investment bankers would be a waste of
corporate assets,'' Reynolds said in its regulatory filing.

   BETH ORTON/``CENTRAL RESERVATION'' (Arista)
</P>
<P>
   From her 1993 association with techno producer William Orbit to
work with the Chemical Brothers through her own 1997 solo debut,
``Trailer Park,'' husky-voiced neo-folk diva Orton has maintained a
certain mystique. Now with the release of her sophomore full-length
effort, which offers an intriguing blend of acoustic and
underground elements, Orton is poised for a breakthrough. While her
voice remains upfront, and the sometimes ambient background
textures are enticing, it's Orton's songwriting that reveals the
most growth, especially on such standouts as the smoky leadoff
track, ``Stolen Car'' (featuring Ben Harper), ``Sweetest Decline''
and the gorgeous ``Stars All Seem to Weep.'' The adventurous title
song, incidentally, is offered here in its original form and
remixed by Everything But the Girl's Ben Watt. 3 stars

SILVERCHAIR/``NEON BALLROOM'' (Epic)
</P>
<P>
   These once-underage Australian grunge merchants have somehow
turned into a rather straightforward rock act. String arrangements
and political rants from frontman Daniel Johns show the group has
matured, while sturdy tunes like ``Black Tangled Heart'' suggest
Silverchair has a few more minutes left on the clock. In one of the
oddest collaborations of the year, ``Shine'' pianist David Helfgott
contributes to ``Emotion Sickness.'' 2 stars

   All Jeff Beck fans want out of life is either an all-blues album

backward, and the techno rhythms the guitar great uses here seem
dated and rather thin. For his first collection of original music
in a decade, the imaginative guitarist was clearly inspired by the
likes of Prodigy, but even that once forward-thinking outfit has
gathered dust. Still, the outlandish and humorous sounds Beck
manages to wrangle from his Stratocaster, especially on standout
tracks ``Mama Said'' and ``Brush With the Blues,'' place this
effort among Beck's best. 3 stars

JERRY REED/``PICKIN' '' (Southern Tracks)
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's versatile studio hotshot and sometime actor Reed
shows why he's in such demand with this guitar-heavy solo disc.
Playing electric, acoustic and rhythm guitar, Reed, deploying an
unusual clawhammer picking style, is joined by Kenny Malone on
drums and Jerry Douglas on dobro for a good-natured collection of
skillful country tunes that never wears out its welcome. 3 stars

HADDA BROOKS/``I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU'' (Pointblank)
</P>
<P>
   Blues-singing pianist Brooks has been making music for 80 years.
While her torch-song delivery is rooted in big band, her
boogie-woogie piano is steeped in jump blues and r&AMP;b. This
double-disc compilation offers refreshing material from the
singer's '40s and '50s heyday, along with a recent duet with Brooks
fanatic and local rocker Carla Bozulich. 3 stars

HANK CRAWFORD AND JIMMY MCGRIFF/``CRUNCH TIME'' (Milestone)
</P>
<P>
   Since they first joined forces in 1986, saxophonist Crawford and
Hammond organist McGriff have explored their chemistry on a string
of soul-jazz outings. For their fifth Milestone release, the pair
stay with their winning formula of swing, funk, blues and gospel
elements. Backed by r&AMP;b greats, including drummer Bernard Purdie
and guitarist Cornell Dupree, the kindred spirits go at it on such
marvels as ``Bow Legs,'' ``Don't Deceive Me (Please Don't Go)'' and
``What's Goin' On'' with sanctified gusto. 3 stars

MICHEL PETRUCCIANI/``SOLO LIVE'' (Dreyfus)
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death last January, Petrucciani, one of the
last of the great romantic jazz pianists, was readying this album
documenting his 1997 solo tour of Europe. The freedom and
creativity afforded by the solo format allows us to appreciate
Petrucciani's genius in undiluted form. Here, along with such fine
originals as ``Looking Up'' and ``Brazilian Like,'' the pianist
pays tribute to heroes like Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn. 3

   _ Fred Shuster &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FRANK SINATRA, DEAN MARTIN AND SAMMY DAVIS, JR./``THE SUMMIT''
(DCC)
</P>
<P>
   We've read the books, watched the TV specials and endured the
mediocre cable movie. Now, finally, we have the first album that
documents an evening of Rat Pack fun.The album was taped by
Sinatra's engineers during a 16-date stint at a mobster's nightclub
just outside of Chicago. Martin, Sinatra and Davis sing a few songs
on their own and then get together for impressions, medleys and
jokes, most of which wouldn't past muster in these politically
correct times. The mood is light; the camaraderie tight. If you're
a fan, you'll love it and won't mind paying the extra money that
this disc costs. (It's only available on 24-karat gold compact
disc.) The curious may just want to content themselves with the
occasional documentary clip. 3 stars

SPREADING `SUNSCREEN' ON THE AIRWAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL BEGGY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most songs tell a story; this one is a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)'' is an unlikely tune to
be scorching up the charts, because it isn't really a song. It's a
spoken litany of advice over part of a movie soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Once you hear it, it sticks with you: the booming voice of
Australian actor Lee Perry giving the mock graduation address that
starts, ``Ladies and gentlemen of the class of 1999, wear
sunscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the common-sense speech _ often requested on radio
stations as the Sunscreen Song _ unfolds over the song
``Everybody's Free (To Feel Good)'' by Quindon Tarver from the
soundtrack of Australian director Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film
``William Shakespeare's Romeo &AMP; Juliet.'' It is filled with such
nuggets as: ``Stretch.'' ``Do one thing everyday that scares you.''
``Floss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's Free'' evolved from a graduation-time column by
Mary Schmich in the Chicago Tribune in 1997 that turned into an
Internet hoax involving Kurt Vonnegut and MIT before Luhrmann
decided the column and the story behind it would make a great
addition to a music compilation he was producing.
</P>
<P>
   From print to cyberspace to the airwaves to print again _ a
'90s-style media mash was brewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea _ who could? _ when I wrote it that any of this
would take place,'' said Schmich from Chicago, where she's written
a thrice-weekly column since 1992. ``I wanted to write a graduation
speech and I said, `Not that anybody asked me.' '' But you can bet
come this commencement season, Schmich will be part of a lot of
graduations.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of Boston's largest stations play the song as part of
their regular rotation, so if you haven't heard it on the radio,
chances are you will soon. Local sales of Luhrmann's CD ``Something
for Everybody'' have increased tenfold in the last week, said
DeeDee Kearney, the regional representative for Capitol Records,
which has a sweet marketing dilemma on its hands. In every city and
station where it has been tested, the song has caught on, and the
record company can't get it to stores fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston area was one of the first to give the song airtime,
but it really took hold earlier this year in the Portland and
Seattle radio markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really on all formats, which is what makes it so
unusual,'' said Kearney. The only station that hasn't tried it yet
is WKLB, which has a country music format. ``I wouldn't be
surprised, if they tested it, that it didn't `pop' there as well,''
Kearney said.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful trends in music are usually driven by one
market segment, but ``Everybody's Free'' is a success across ages
and formats, said Robyn Ryland of Capitol's New York office. ``We
haven't had anything that compares to this in memory.''
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that the song's message is positive, if
simple. ``So many things are negative in music. Kids are requesting
it and parents think it's OK,'' said ``Kid'' David Corey, music
director for Kiss-108 in Boston. ``Parents are requesting it too.''
</P>
<P>
   For Schmich, who also writes the Brenda Starr comic strip, it
has been a somewhat anonymous brush with fame. Shortly after her
column appeared it was spread on the Internet as a graduation
address by Kurt Vonnegut to the MIT graduating class. Of course it
wasn't written by the novelist, nor was he the commencement
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The story was so convincing, even Vonnegut's wife, photographer
Jill Krementz, fell for it and forwarded it to his children as his
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 or so cities where the song is playing on the
airwaves, Chicago isn't one of them. But Schmich is starting to get
some recognition, has received about $100 in royalties, and has
spent several days ``on the wrong side of interviews'' with
reporters from around the country. To top it off, Schmich, who
confesses a secret passion for song-writing, could find herself
being nominated next year for a Grammy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh wow, hadn't thought of that,'' said Schmich. So what's the
columnist-songwriter's next project? ``Writing tomorrow's column.''
Simple and straightforward. Right where this all started.
</P>

OTHER FILM EVENTS ON OSCAR WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB MCCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you're like most of us, your seat for Sunday
night's Academy Awards won't be at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
Then it's time to start thinking about upcoming film events that
you can get into and experience from somewhere other than your
living room couch.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar nominees for best short and feature-length documentary
are being honored Saturday at the 17th annual DocuDay at the
Directors Guild of America in West Hollywood. The all-day program
of documentary screenings and discussions with the filmmakers
begins at 10 a.m. and is co-sponsored by the DGA and the
International Documentary Association, which promotes the art of
nonfiction filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   The documentaries are ``The Farm: Angola, U.S.A.''
``Dancemaker,'' ``The Personals: Improvisations on Romance in the
Golden Years,'' ``A Place in the Sun,'' ``Sunrise Over Tiananmen
Square,'' ``Regret to Inform,'' ``The Last Days'' and ``Lenny
Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The DGA is at 7920 Sunset Blvd. Tickets are available at the
door and from Ticketmaster; $7 general admission, $5 for IDA
members, full-time students and seniors. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SPIKE'S MOMENT: The Spike Lee retrospective is wrapping up at the
American Cinematheque's Egyptian in Hollywood. Lee's emergence in
the 1980s not only propelled indie filmmakers but led the way for
other African-American directors to create films with their own
distinct voices, for example John Singleton (``Boyz N the Hood''),
Carl Franklin (``Devil in a Blue Dress'') and Reginald Hudlin
(``House Party'').
</P>
<P>
   At 7 tonight, there will be a screening of ``Mo Better Blues''
(1990), a jazz movie the way Lee wanted to make it. ``Clockers''
follows at 9:30 and examines the cycle of urban violence and terror
through the eyes of a 16-year-old boy whose loyalty to the local
drug lord extends to killing. Saturday's program starts at 6 p.m.
with a triple-header of ``Get on the Bus,'' ``He Got Game'' and
``Freak.'' The latter is a collaboration between Lee and John
Leguizamo, who adapts his one-man show about being a Latino in
America for the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets cost $7 for general public, $5 for Cinematheque members.
Call (323) 466-3456, Ext. 2 for more information. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MORRISSEY AT LACMA: The films of Paul Morrissey, who is known for
his association with Andy Warhol, are the subject of a
retrospective ongoing at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's
Bing Theatre. Morrissey's ``Flesh'' and ``Heat'' _ two of his
best-known productions _ screen at 7:30 and 10 tonight. His 3-D
accomplishment ``Flesh for Frankenstein'' will screen at 7:30 and
10 p.m. Saturday. Viewer discretion is advised for his
``Frankenstein'' because of nudity and graphic violence. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SAVING IS GOOD: Those who would rather reminisce can put together a
list of films that should be preserved and send it off to the
National Film Preservation Board. The panel is considering which
titles to add to the 250 already in the National Film Registry. The
board considers films 10 years or older that have culture,
historical or aesthetic significance.
</P>
<P>
   The 250 films selected for the national archives since it was
established in 1989 run the gamut from sentimental favorites
``Casablanca'' and ``Gone With the Wind'' to monster movies
``Frankenstein'' and ``The Bride of Frankenstein'' to the
futuristic ``Blade Runner'' and the ``Flash Gordon'' serial.
</P>
<P>
   For a list of the registry's protected titles, go to
lcweb.loc.gov/film/ on the Web, or call Steve Leggett at the
Library of Congress, (202) 707-5912.
</P>
<P>
   Lists should be limited to 50 films of any genre. Deadline for
nominations is April 16. Mail suggestions to: National Film
Registry, Attention: Steve Leggett, Library of Congress, Motion
Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division, Washington, D.C.

HANDICAPPING THE OSCAR ENTRIES FOR BEST DRAMATIC SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Who will win the Oscar for original dramatic score
on Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   We asked the husband-and-wife film composing team of Starr
Parodi and Jeff Eden Fair to handicap the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite is clearly John Williams for his emotional ``Saving
Private Ryan'' score.
</P>
<P>
   ``His score will win,'' Parodi declared. ``It's brilliant and
moving. We tend to go for really emotional film music. But even
while Williams is the favorite, it's also the most amazing score.
His music reflected the maturity and bravery you see in the film.
In most action movies, directors generally like the music to
reflect the action. But in `Private Ryan,' the soundtrack was
silent during many of the action sequences, which made the music
more powerful when it did come in.''
</P>
<P>
   The versatile Parodi and Fair's first full-length score was for
Rysher Films' 1998 ``The 18th Angel,'' which starred Stanley Tucci
and Maximillian Schell, and in which the Los Angeles composers
worked with a 90-piece orchestra and boys choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scores this year really aren't on a level playing field in
terms of budget,'' Fair said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Williams' ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the Academy Award
nominees for dramatic score are David Hirschfelder for
``Elizabeth,'' Nicola Piovani for ``Life Is Beautiful,'' Randy
Newman for ``Pleasantville'' and Hans Zimmer for ``The Thin Red
Line.''
</P>
<P>
   Parodi pointed out that ``Pleasantville'' was more song-driven
than score-driven, and the subsequent soundtrack album consisted of
pop songs as well as Newman's orchestral score.
</P>
<P>
   ``The score didn't play as big a role in the film as it did in
`Private Ryan,''' she said. ``Newman is amazing, and his score is
beautiful. And even when we saw the movie, we didn't realize how
great the score was until we got the CD afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Parodi also liked Piovani's atmospheric ``Life Is Beautiful''
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very traditional Italian score with the exception of
the main title,'' she offered. ``It truly reflected the period.
There was a lot of emotion there.''
</P>
<P>
   Parodi and Fair _ who've scored such high-profile trailers as
``Deep Impact,'' ``Braveheart,'' ``Leaving Las Vegas'' and
``GoldenEye'' _ recently finished an indie titled ``Screenland
Drive,'' a dark comedy by first-time feature director Thomas
Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening back to a good score really allows you to relive the
move,'' Fair said. ``It brings back a lot of scenes that may mean
something to you. It should amount to more than just a passive
listening experience.'' &QL;

VALENTIN: FAMILY MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Sometimes it's pretty hard to relate to
today's major league baseball players, what with their pampered
lifestyle and multimillion-dollar contracts. But every once in a
while, a dose of sobering reality strikes a player and we all are
reminded that ballplayers suffer sometimes, too.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox third baseman John Valentin has gone through such a
situation this spring. Valentin had to make a quick reaction to a
family crisis over the weekend, and it may have helped save a niece
who on Monday had an operation for a brain tumor in a New York
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Valentin, 9, is doing just fine at Beth Israel North
Hospital in New York. So is her father, Arnold, of nearby Hazlett,
N.J. John Valentin is his younger brother and lives only a few
miles away in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Valentin is not a man without means. He is an
investigator for the prosecutor's office in Essex County, N.J. But
he needed some support once doctors discovered a recurring headache
that had bothered his oldest daughter was caused by a tumor in the
fourth brain chamber. On Monday, doctors removed a golf ball-sized
tumor. With some luck, says Valentin, she will recover fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just needed to be there and show my family some support,''
said the Red Sox third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   This is far from Valentin's first encounter with a cancer
patient. He's a regular visitor to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute
in Boston. His mere presence is said to brighten the spirits of
many of the children there.
</P>
<P>
   But it never hit as close to home as this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really incredible,'' said Valentin. ``In Boston, I see
these children every day at the park or in the hospitals. You feel
for the families and you try to do as much as you can. You never
realize it can happen to your family, and it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family came together and we talked about a lot of things _
how you've got to be prepared for it, hope that everything will be
all right, put your trust with the doctors and let them do what
they do best, and just pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin had been following his niece's progress by telephone
until last Friday, when the team announced he was leaving camp
indefinitely for personal reasons. In a training camp starved for
news, this stirred suspicion of a possible trade. But it was
confirmed he was in New Jersey on a family matter a couple of days
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked for permission to go home,''said manager Jimy
Williams. ``It was a family situation and he thought he could help
out. I told him to go ahead and not to worry about things here.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he arrived in New Jersey, Valentin said, he found he could
be helpful in a lot of ways. His family was shaken and needed some
comfort. He was there, and for them that was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of all the children I dealt with in Boston,'' said
Valentin, ``I kind of took it better than most of my family. It was
actually kind of good that I had that kind of experience behind me.
I could relieve some of the pain from my family. It was good that I
was there to talk with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they tell us that that everything is going to be OK and
that cancer is curable, then that's what you have to hold on to.
The important thing is that we were all there and were supporting
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin returned to camp Wednesday and held an impromptu press
conference, where he said he has a better understanding of life
because of this experience. Like his brother, he has two children,
Justin John, 4, and Kendall Marie, 2. What happened to Alexandra
could happen to his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball means nothing,'' said Valentin. ``A situation like
this puts things in perspective. I'm thankful in a way for having
the experience of dealing with so many families. It's given me
information about the whole situation and about the kids who get
this disease. I'm thankful for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this type of situation, you only think that the worst is
going to happen. You need to be there. We're fortunate it turned
out the way it did. We knew we had to think positive. I tell all
the families that I touch that I'm not just there trying to put a
smile on their face. I sort of hold their hands, lift up their
glass, and remind them that it is still half full.''

LESS FRENZY, MORE DOWNTIME FEELS RIGHT TO SANDRA BULLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Sandra Bullock swears that she's not trying to
leave her male fan base behind, but it sure looks that way from her
movies. Last year, Bullock starred in ``Hope Floats'' and
``Practical Magic'' (``Chick flicks both,'' she readily admits with
a laugh) and now she's back with ``Forces of Nature,'' a romantic
road picture co-starring Ben Affleck that won't be causing too many
testosterone surges in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more a comedy with unconventional romantic elements,''
Bullock says brightly. ``It's `Midnight Run' meets `The Odd
Couple.' There's a lot of guy stuff in there. But who knows? I
don't know anything about who will like what.''
</P>
<P>
   And she doesn't much care, either. After being on the fast track
with big-budget movies like the ``Speed'' films, Bullock is
following her heart, thinking less about pleasing others (``I had
the people-pleasing disease for a long time,'' she says) than about
satisfying herself. She's producing short films at a furious rate,
and her company, Fortis Films, recently finished a $3 million indie
titled ``Gun Shy,'' starring Liam Neeson and Oliver Platt.
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, the 34-year-old actress says she has never
been happier. She has lived in Austin, Texas, for the past two
years, redesigning a sprawling French provincial farmhouse to her
dream specifications. And, like Sarah, her character in ``Forces of
Nature'' (a wildly free-spirited woman always on the run because of
insecurities), Bullock feels like she may finally have reached the
point in her life where she might actually be good for somebody _
as a wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't drive people crazy anymore,'' the 34-year-old actress
says. ``Or at least, not as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Here the always-charming Bullock talks about her increased
sanity, why she would rather be naked than have to sing on camera
and why the guy who wrote ``Tuesdays With Morrie'' should be
sending her his undying thanks (not to mention an autographed
copy).
</P>
<P>
   Daily News: After playing restrained women in ``Hope Floats''
and ``Practical Magic,'' it must have been a relief to be offered a
wild child like Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: It's fun to play somebody who's struggling to get out
and pop open those buttons, but it has been done to the nines by
me. I've already popped all my buttons. It was time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   DN: If anything, Sarah seems to be more like you than those
other mopey women.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: Her energy is more who I am in my private life than
anything I've ever done before. You got a little bit of that in ``A
Time to Kill,'' too, but I'm thought of more as the girl next door
than the girl who's going to wreck somebody's marriage.
</P>
<P>
   DN: You also make your singing debut here, crooning a little
Etta James.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: While sitting, half-naked, in a bathtub. That was very
embarrassing. But I'd rather be naked than have to sing. That's how
strongly I feel about my singing.
</P>
<P>
   DN: You kind of caught the producing bug with ``Hope Floats,''
and, unlike most stars, you actually seem to enjoy the grunt work.
What's the appeal?
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: The satisfaction of seeing something through from start
to finish. The satisfaction of getting things going for other
people. I love watching somebody breaking ground and surprising
others. I love working on soundtracks and breaking new artists, and
now I live in the perfect place, Austin, to do just that. I listen
to hours and hours of music on cassettes given to me by musicians,
and I never get tired of it. I love the thrill of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   DN: And you seem to love Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: Every second I'm not working, I'm there. Artistically,
it has a great independent-movie support system, the music scene is
incredible, and the art community is great. The city is
progressive, smart, diverse, eclectic, racially integrated,
socially integrated ... young, old, college, they're all there.
Plus, 10 minutes outside of town, you can be on a lake, chilling.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Sounds pretty good. Do you know any real-estate agents?
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: (Laughs) No, no. People in Austin keep telling me,
``I'm glad you're here, but please, don't tell anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: Is this going to be home for good?
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: I feel very settled. Before, I was always manically
running around. And I think you do that if you're running away from
stuff and from whatever insecurities you might have. And,
eventually, I had to stop and think, ``What am I missing here that
I need to address? What is making me this frazzled bundle of manic
energy that drives people insane?''
</P>
<P>
   DN: Did you come up with any answers?
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: Yes _ after about a year and a half. It was very
unsettling. I had no idea of who I was or what I was about. It was
always whatever everybody else wanted me to be. So I had to stop
worrying _ about things that are out of my control and about what
other people think. My circle of friends has gotten smaller because
of that, but those people are amazing and more honest with me.
</P>
<P>
   DN: ``Forces of Nature'' addresses a lot of this stuff. That
can't be a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: It's the main reason I took the movie. And what it says
about marriage, too: Who's to think that once you make that
decision that you'll never look at another person, or never be
stimulated by someone of the opposite sex or same sex, whatever
your preference.
</P>
<P>
   We make marriage too clean in movies and don't bring up some of
the scarier issues and the mistakes we make. This movie isn't
afraid of that and dives right in.
</P>
<P>
   DN: So you're not a big believer in monogamy?
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: I've been in two four-year relationships and others
that have lasted two years. So I feel like I've had certain
marriages, marriages I would now be divorced from. And that scares
me so much, maybe a little too much.
</P>
<P>
   DN: But now that you've done a little thinking and you know what
you're about ...
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: Now I'm at the point where, if I meet someone, I'll
meet an incredible human being, not merely an excuse or the best
person I could find. I know I'll be doing it for the absolute right
reasons, and who knows in the end if it will work, but it will be
for the right reasons.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Sounds pretty pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: I've never been one of those girls just pining to meet
the right guy and be a bride. I would love to be a romantic, but
I'm a very literal and pragmatic person. For instance, I hate
Valentine's Day. It was invented by Hallmark, for crying out loud.
It's so stupid. The pressure is so insane. To me, that isn't
romance, it's forced intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Prospective suitors should forget the flowers and chocolate
boxes then?
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: Three Valentine's Days ago, I had a serious breakup. It
was very heartbreaking. We made a great dinner, and it was a
beautiful night, and, right in the middle of it, we realized it
wasn't working. It looked perfect on the outside and very romantic,
but on the inside, things were falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   DN: OK, then, what is your favorite celebratory day?
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: New Year's Eve is my favorite day of the year, period.
There is no pressure. It's about the joining of friends and just
playing. This year, I'm planning a big party at my place. There
will be barbecue and a great Austin band and just dancing, dancing,
dancing. If the world's going to end, you might as well be dancing.
</P>
<P>
   DN: That's a sound philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock: That's what Morrie from that book ``Tuesdays With
Morrie'' was about. He loved to dance, the liberation of it.
</P>
<P>
   I've bought thousands and thousands of copies of that book and
given them to everyone I know. It's like a life gift. It helps
people see life a new way, because here was a man, a philosopher,
who applied his teachings during the worst time of his life. You
can't look away from that. It's so genuine. And I think that's why
the book has affected so many people. It all comes back to living
in the moment, something I'm trying to do every day of my life.

FORECAST OF 70 PUTS HEAT ON MCGWIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Life changes when you hit 70 home runs in a
single season. When you are Everybody's Man of the Year and some
goof pays $3 million for one of your $10 home run balls, you can't
expect to walk around anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire had fun in the offseason of his life. He did
Letterman, Rosie, and the ESPYs. He got in bed with Helen Hunt in
``Mad About You.'' He was a guest star _ or at least his voice was
_ on ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back playing baseball (already with five spring
training homers), preparing for an encore season and answering an
endless succession of barking dogs who ask, ``Can you hit 70
again?''
</P>
<P>
   He's not complaining. McGwire knows that school teachers and
plumbers don't want to hear about the woes of fame and fortune. He
knows he is truly blessed. But who wants to be a prisoner of fame?
How would any of us like it if we couldn't go to the local 7-11 for
a Slurpee without everybody knowing?
</P>
<P>
   There are no trips to 7-11 for McGwire. No stops at the ATM
machine. No movies. It's just not worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' he said Wednesday after going 1 for 3 (a hard
single) against the Kansas City Royals at Roger Dean Stadium.
``I've been out a few times at night down here and people come up
to me and go, `Oh, I think it's so great that you're out hanging
out with us.' It's nothing new to me but when I go out, I have to
be mentally prepared to go out because people want to talk and they
want to shake your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird went to matinees at Chestnut Hill _ under a baseball
cap. McGwire won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about going to the movies is, you walk in and the
people who work there tell everybody that works there, and they get
on the phone and call their friends and their friends start coming
over and the next thing you know you leave the movies and there's
people waiting for you outside.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he hasn't read most of the stuff that was written about
himself and Sammy Sosa after last season. Like most ballplayers, he
thumbs through the USA Today that the hotel slips under the door
for free.
</P>
<P>
   He laughs when reminded of Senator Ted Kennedy's famous
double-gaffe at a presidential fund-raiser last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean Mike McGwire?,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah. And Sammy Soo-ser.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have latched onto the Summer of '98 and McGwire has
become his generation's Neil Armstrong. It seems that every person
he meets in the street just has to shake his hand and tell him
where they were and what they were doing when Big Mac cranked No.
62 and No. 70.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Matthew, the chunky batboy from '98, is playing ball,
doing what comes naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my son was going to be a switch hitter,'' said
McGwire. ``But I never say anything to him about baseball. I just
let him go. Have fun. Enjoy it. See the ball and take a swing at
it. He's starting to really sprout now. He's starting to get out of
his chubby stage. It'd be great if he became a pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   If you bought any signed McGwire stuff in a baseball card store
recently, get your money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every autograph in a memorabilia store out there is a forgery
because I don't do them,'' he said. ``The only way you can get an
autograph from me is if you see me in public or at a ballpark. I
sign 95 percent of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   If you followed McGwire down the stretch, it was difficult to
get past the notion that he was trying to hit home runs on that
final weekend against the Expos. Sosa pulled ahead of McGwire,
66-65, Friday night, but Big Mac finished with a flurry, cranking
five homers in is final 11 at-bats, including two Saturday and two
more Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never tried to hit a home run,'' he insisted. ``I'm so
mentally prepared every at-bat, if you're going to throw anything
over the white part of the plate and if my swing is on, I have a
chance. I got some balls to hit the last weekend of the season. We
were playing Montreal. They had young studs who threw hard and went
right at me. But what youngster wouldn't do that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there's the unrealistic thing of, `Can you do 70 again?'
What happened last year might never happen again. And if it
doesn't, does it mean there was anything wrong with it?''
</P>
<P>
   No. Not at all.

BRIDGING THE AGE DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer and psychologist Mary Pipher recalls the story of a
client who took her mother to a therapist. After the appointment,
the mother reported that she'd passed her mental health checkup and
didn't need to go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you tell him about the bankruptcy? Did you tell him about
your panic attacks?'' the daughter asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' her mother replied sharply. ``It was none of his
business.''
</P>
<P>
   To Pipher, the story is a perfect example of the exasperating
but common sorts of ``cultural collisions'' that take place between
older people and their children, two generations shaped by vastly
different cultures. In this case the clash was between an older
person raised to believe in the value of keeping one's feelings to
oneself, and her baby boomer daughter, whose peer group's credo is
``emote and be authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   There are countless examples of such collisions, Pipher writes
in her new book, ``Another Country: Navigating the Emotional
Terrain of our Elders'' (Riverhead). A father who gets upset
because his daughter wants to bring up the past, while he prefers
to ``let sleeping dogs lie.'' The son who wanted to know his
mother's medical condition, while she ``doesn't want him to
worry.''
</P>
<P>
   This vast psychological ``terra incognita'' that separates the
generations is probably wider now than it's ever been, Pipher
maintains, with families scattered across the country and little
exposure to one another's universes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``aging in America is harder than it needs to be,''
writes Pipher, 51, in her book, a kind of field guide to old age,
combining personal stories with social theory.
</P>
<P>
   Today's elderly and their families are dealing with the
vexations of old age _ physical decline, affordable housing, and
high health-care costs, she says, but the two generations ``don't
even know how to talk about our problems. We have no language for
nurturing interdependency.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Americans don't have the traditions and wisdom to
make the final years of life manageable. ``The last years of a
relationship are important ones,'' she says. ``We need to reconnect
the age groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipher previously tackled life's difficult passages in the
best-selling ``Reviving Ophelia'' (Ballantine), her empathetic 1994
book about how our culture affects the mental health of adolescent
girls.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Another Country,'' Pipher decided to focus on a
subsection of the population she says writers usually overlook. She
was not interested in the elders she calls the ``young-old'' _
healthy, ``you-are-only-as-young-as-you-feel'' seniors enjoying
their golden years _ but rather the ``old-old,'' whose lives are
characterized by ill health and loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``What tends to be written about less are the really difficult
last years, when health is failing, people are losing
relationships, and may be losing homes and bank accounts. As a
student of human behavior, I was interested in how people coped
with enormous amounts of loss,'' she said in a telephone interview
from her home in Lincoln, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Pipher interviewed her clients, friends, and neighbors _ older
Midwesterners who had experienced the rigors of farm life, poverty,
and war _ as well as the children who were struggling to care for
them. She did hear happy stories of resilience and humor _ such as
the man, married 50 years, who shared the secret of a successful
marriage: He looked in the mirror every morning and said, ``You're
no prize, either.'' There were stories of parents and children
doing well together, such as the daughter who takes her mother to
Hawaii every February and drives 50 miles each Sunday to spend the
day with her.
</P>
<P>
   But more often she heard sorrowful tales _ from both generations
_ of conflict, frustration, guilt, and anger. ``While the old often
feel abandoned and misunderstood, their younger relatives often
feel unappreciated, stressed, and guilty,'' writes Pipher. ``Hurt
feelings often come from taking personally problems that are
cultural or developmental.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipher says she was motivated to write the book because, as she
herself aged, she was curious about how older people cope with
difficulties. She was struck by two significant differences between
old people and baby boomers. The elderly, who came of age before
the popularity of Freudian psychology, are less analytical than
their self-reflective children. And elders define themselves in
relation to their community, while boomers are more
individualistic.
</P>
<P>
   Older people grew up at a time when ``people had certain
communal responsibilities and reputations,'' Pipher says. ``In the
small town I grew up in, people had a role to play. That kind of
world has been replaced by one in which we are seen more as
consumers. People in the 1990s are thought about as demographic
groups and shopping niches.''
</P>
<P>
   These outlooks cause all sorts of trickle-down effects, which
make for no end of frustration and miscommunication, she says: Old
people show love by being useful, while their children touch, or
say ``I love you''; old people _ raised to put their trust in
authority _ are afraid to confront their doctors, unlike their more
cynical baby boomer children.
</P>
<P>
   Pipher notes being surprised at how resilient and adaptable
older people showed themselves to be. ``One thing that generation
knows how to do is put on their dancing shoes and go out on a
Saturday night. This is not something our generation knows how to
do. They know how to process pain but not how to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds: ``I would certainly not have seen the older generation
as having a lot to teach our generation about mental health. I
would show up at their homes, and despite the fact that I was young
and healthy and had a nice life, they would be more cheerful than
me. I thought: They know some stuff!''
</P>
<P>
   As she gets older, Pipher finds herself more apt to appreciate
the coping strategies developed by older people. Putting on a happy
face is not necessarily all that bad, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense you can see it as setting themselves up to being
hypocritical or in denial. Or you can see it as setting themselves
up to put on a happy face. And sometimes you feel better that way
than if you are trained to be in touch with your feelings.''

WHEN WOMEN TRUST THEIR BODIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; was passionate about natural childbirth and breast feeding
when I was having babies in the '60s. At the time, we rebellious
young mothers were fighting assembly-line methods of delivery,
uptight hospitals, and take-charge doctors. Natural childbirth is
far less popular these days, perhaps because we've all grown used
to being managed by managed care.
</P>
<P>
   When I received this letter from Sandra Steingraber, honoring
the birth of her daughter, Faith, I wanted to share parts of it
with you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first trimester was a return to childhood. I went to bed
at 9. I took naps. I threw up. I looked on all food with deep
suspicion. I even bought a baby toothbrush because my big grown-up
one somehow gagged me. During the fourth month, April, I began to
swell. By May, I was dreamy with estrogen and flush with blood.
(Pregnancy increases blood volume by a third.) By June, I was a
walking aquarium tank. Inside me, Sea World, water ballet, hourly
shows. Leaps of Faith.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Lightening' is an old midwifery term for the descent of the
fetus into the pelvis a few weeks before birth. The further the
baby drops down into its bony cage, the lighter the mother feels.
This happened for me just as August turned into September. Then one
day, amniotic fluid gushed down my legs and ran across the
floorboards; a half-hour later I felt as though I were having
intense menstrual cramps. On the scale of physical torment, the
pain of labor is not the strongest pain I've ever endured. Back
spasms are worse. So is orthodontics. But the pain of childbirth is
the most exhausting pain I have ever experienced. It is truly labor
_ this passing of one life through the body of another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pain came in from the sides, like my pelvis was caught in
an ever-tightening vise. The labor of labor was the fact that I was
both the squeezed and the squeezer. Being squeezed was bearable _
as long as I kept breathing and listening to my husband's voice. It
was the completely involuntary work of doing all the squeezing that
was so overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was good at letting pain pass through me like wind through a
tunnel, but during delivery I was asked to push into the pain
instead of casting my consciousness away from it. I balked. I
wanted to go home. At some point, as the baby's head appeared, the
tissues around the mouth of the vagina become numb, like a foot
that has gone to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is useful. I pushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I ignored all the advice I got about having a
`flexible birth plan' and remaining `open to' narcotics, epidurals,
and other pain-numbing drugs. There is nothing heroic, childbirth
educators are fond of saying, about experiencing pain; there is
nothing to prove through suffering, they emphasize, when so many
alternatives exist. Frankly, hospital-based childbirth classes are
more about making women familiar with (and therefore compliant
consumers of) medical interventions than they are about helping
women trust their own bodies. Thus, drugs hang in the birthing room
like the apple in Eden. I am glad I closed my mind against them.
Hell yes, drug-free childbirth is heroic. What does it prove? That
desire is greater than fear, that women are brave and
self-sufficient, that consciousness is better than numbness, that
out of pain comes joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra is also choosing to breast-feed her daughter. She
recalls:
</P>
<P>
   ``My milk did not come in until Day 5. When it did, I was taking
a nap and had the vague sensation that my chest was fizzing, as
though my breasts were two Coke bottles that someone had shaken up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning to breast-feed is like learning the tango. You wonder
how we managed to overpopulate the earth. First, the baby screams
and there is no milk. Then there is milk but the baby sleeps five
hours and the breasts harden painfully. Finally, the baby and the
breasts fill and empty in synchrony. It took weeks. For Faith,
mastery of the breast has brought a kind of complete bliss I've
never seen before; eating, intimacy, and play all in the same
gesture. No one has ever enjoyed my body more. When she is finished
eating, she pops her mouth off, heaves a sigh, and then throws her
head down on my chest, arms spread, with a nipple in her ear _ as
if listening for the milky tide to rush back in.''
</P>
<P>
   My own daughter Laura has just turned 35, and I still remember
my ecstatic return from the delivery room, and saying to my
husband, who had been banned from my side during the birth, ``I
could go back up there and do it again.'' I still treasure the
memory of that daring adventure and the bliss of those mutual
moments of satiation, one of us full of milk, and the other filled
to the brim by the rapture of loving.

DAVIS GOING OUT IN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Somehow it is fitting that what could be the last game
of Tom Davis's coaching career comes against a New England team.
</P>
<P>
   It was in New England, at Boston College (from 1977-82), where
Davis established himself as a major Division 1 college coach.
</P>
<P>
   So if this is it for Davis, who was told earlier this season
that the University of Iowa would not renew his contract, having it
end against old Big East rival UConn somehow would seem right.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there are any guarantees that it will end for Davis and
the Hawkeyes, who are riding an emotional last hurrah.
</P>
<P>
   After all, few people expected the fifth-seeded Hawkeyes (20-9)
to get past fourth seed Arkansas last week in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But they are here, playing in the NCAA West Regional semifinal
against No. 1 seeded UConn as an underdog and a sentimental one at
that.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkeyes have been in that role since Iowa athletic director
Bob Bowsby decided that the 60-year-old Davis, after 13 seasons at
Iowa, no longer fit in the school's long-range basketball plans.
</P>
<P>
   During the up-and-down regular season, as Iowa absorbed injuries
and losses, it did not seem a big deal. Everyone understood Davis
was a lame duck and whether or not you agreed with the decision, it
was a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   It still is, to the point where Southwest Missouri coach (and
former Indiana player) Steve Alford has all but been anointed the
next Iowa coach.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa's success over the weekend in the NCAA Tournament has
caused a mixture of emotions in Iowa City, primarily happiness for
Davis, but also uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   What if Iowa keeps winning, and makes it to the Final Four?
</P>
<P>
   Would the school offer a contract extension with the possibility
that Davis would say no, which would only increase the
embarrassment? Or would it fire a coach who has taken the school to
its first Final Four in 29 years?
</P>
<P>
   Davis says he's not worried about it. Not yet at least. ``I have
no plans other than to reflect,'' he said Wednesday. ``When the
season is over, most of us are wiped out. You're exhausted mentally
and physically. At the end, I will try to reflect and recover and
then see what I want to do and where I want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis says he is enjoying this run as much as he has enjoyed
anything he has done in coaching. ``I tend to live life for the
moment,'' he said. ``I appreciate the experience, but I don't know
if I've approached this season any different than any other time in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa players say they have done their best to separate
Davis's situation from the day-to-day business of the season. It
has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not been really spoken about by the players or coaches,''
said Kent McCausland, Iowa's senior guard. ``It's just been a
subconscious reason to get ready to practice, to get ready to
fight, to play hard, and to leave everything on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after the public practices, UConn coach Jim Calhoun
was in a room talking to members of the CBS staff while Davis
waited outside. When Calhoun came out, Davis said kiddingly, ``You
kept me waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, who has admired the high road Davis has taken publicly
and has called him a role model for all coaches, kidded right back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting a lot of years to have you wait,'' Calhoun
said with laugh that turned into a hug.

A BOSTON ACCENTS HITS THE SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ What is this, the NCAA South Regional, or
some sort of coaching Beanpot?
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four coaches with teams in this most competitive of
all regionals have Boston backgrounds. We've got St. John's coach
Mike Jarvis, a Cambridge native whose resume includes playing at
Northeastern and coaching at Cambridge Rindge &AMP; Latin, Harvard, and
Boston University; Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien, Boston College
'71, who coached 11 years at his alma mater; and Maryland coach
Gary Williams, who spent one year as assistant and four years as
head coach at BC.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth coach is Auburn's Cliff Ellis, who says he has heard
of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The entanglement is even more pronounced when you consider that
O'Brien now has the job Williams had from 1986 through 1989. ``I
know Jim O'Brien well,'' Williams says. ``He followed me at BC, and
he got to Ohio State eventually. I hope he's not coming to Maryland
to take my job.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien plans on staying in Columbus for a while. He is still
acclimating himself to life in the Big Ten. He would have been
ecstatic had someone told him his team would finish in the upper
half of the league this season. When you're 1-15 in league
competition, you don't have grandiose notions, even if you are
getting a transfer guard you know intimately. In the normal course
of hoop events, the simple addition of one 5-foot-9-inch guard
doesn't have an enormous effect on a team. But, then, there aren't
many Scoonie Penns floating around.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Scoonie told everyone in the fall that Ohio State
would be in the NCAA Tournament this season. ``I don't know how the
other kids responded,'' O'Brien says, ``but I thought he was off
the wall. The only goal I had for us this year was to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   His fourth-seeded squad improved enough to face top-seeded
Auburn in the second game of the South Regional doubleheader. The
truth of the matter is that the Ohio State season has already been
made just by getting into the tournament. Making it to the Sweet 16
is a bonus. Getting to the Final Four might turn out to be the
Third Miracle of Fatima.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien won't, or can't, admit this, but he has less at stake
here than the other three coaches. His team is seeded fourth among
this group for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   The man with the most internal pressure is Williams, who has
never taken a team to the Elite Eight and who has an athletic squad
led by a sensational guard sure to be a high lottery pick, and
probably sooner, rather than later. This may or not be the best
shot of his career at a Final Four, but it is a very good one and
he needs to get there sometime. Since he is unlikely to be coaching
Steve Francis next year, this might be a good time to get the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland (28-5) will be meeting St. John's (27-8) in the opener.
If you like mid-size teams loaded with athleticism and exceptional
basketball versatility, this game is for you. With Maryland having
lost 6-10 center Obina Ekezie to a torn Achilles' tendon a while
back, the Terps are strictly a greyhound, finesse team now. St.
John's doesn't employ anyone taller than 6-7 in any meaningful
capacity. This doesn't mean there won't be ferocious rebound
battles. It just means that this will be a pure basketball game and
not, as Johnny Most would say, a ``muscle tussle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have similar players,'' Williams maintains. ``It's a great
matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis has done a sensational job with a St. John's team
bequeathed to him by Frantic Fran Fraschilla. Whereas the
diminutive Frashcilla was about a 12 on the Uptight-O-Meter, Jarvis
has brought a more relaxed form of quiet intensity to the team.
``One thing I have been preaching to this team all year,'' he says,
``is that no matter how much you want to win a particular game, and
how focused you are on the task, don't forget to have fun. All too
often you can get caught up in the destination, rather than the
journey. The journey, for us, has been a hell of a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis and Williams have a long history. ``I used to bring my
Rindge &AMP; Latin teams to BC to see Gary's teams practice,'' Jarvis
recalls. ``I have always admired the great intensity level of his
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a lot of direct contact on the floor in Boston,
where the Jarvis tenure at BU and the Williams tenure at BC
overlapped for just one year, and where BC just wasn't going to
play BU, period. But Jarvis was able to claim a Maryland scalp for
his Terriers in a 1990 game at the Olde Gahden (65-61). Maryland
wasn't in the habit of playing George Washington when Jarvis
arrived at the Foggy Bottom campus, either, but again Jarvis
finally got a measure of satisfaction with a 70-66 December
tournament win in the MCI Center last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say about playing Gary's teams is that you'd better
be ready to `bring' it, because they are going to `bring' it,''
Jarvis says.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's wasn't supposed to be anywhere near this good,
either, but because the Red Storm play in New York, and because the
newspaper climate there has a tendency to exaggerate many a
situation, they are playing under a lot of pressure. If it's too
much, Jarvis isn't saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the only team left in the tournament who has given Duke
a game,'' he points out, alluding to a 92-88 OT loss Jan. 24 in
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave Auburn's Ellis, the only one of these
four coaches who has never been stuck in traffic on the Southeast
Expressway or eaten a Hoodsie? That leaves him with the No. 1 seed.
And while Auburn may be a football school, folks down there might
not take too kindly to a No. 1 seed in possession of what many
coaches feel is the best collection of athletes in America that
does not do what a No. 1 seed should do.
</P>
<P>
   But why should we care about Cliff Ellis? The guy has never even
owned a snow shovel.

CALL GONCAGA ANYTHING BUT AN UNDERDOG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ First of all it's pronounced Gone-zag-uh, not
Gone-zaw-guh. Not that anyone at the 4,800-student Jesuit school in
Spokane, Wash., really minds a mispronunciation these days.
</P>
<P>
   You can call them anything you want, as long as you mention that
they are one of 16 teams still alive in the NCAA Tournament. As
long as you point out that no Gonzaga team has won more than the 27
games that coach Dan Monson's Zags have won this season, including
two last weekend in Seattle, which is why they faced Florida in the
first game of the NCAA West Regional at the America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't want you to call call Gonzaga (27-6) anymore is
Cinderella or any of those other terms that are pinned on teams who
are not supposed to be playing past the Ides of March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad to accept any term that people give us,'' Monson
said Wednesday as his 10th-seeded team went through its final
preparations for No. 6 seed Florida. ``But I think at this point,
the players take a little exception to the Cinderella label because
it has a connotation that we're lucky to be here and our players
don't feel that way because they believe they can play with
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were any doubts about the team coming out of the
low-key West Coast Conference, they should have been answered with
Gonzaga's solid 82-74 win over No. 2 seed Stanford last Saturday in
a West Regional second-round game.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags have one ingredient that is a necessity for success in
tournament play _ confident, veteran guards. With senior Quentin
Hall and junior Matt Santangelo, Monson knows his team will not
panic in times of stress.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen in the West Coast Conference tournament when a
loss could very well have ended the season. It didn't happen last
weekend in wins over Minnesota and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it happens against the pressure defense of a young, but
talented and deep Florida team remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga has enjoyed the ride into the national spotlight. ``It's
great to be seen,'' said Monson. ``It's been an overwhelming week
for myself and our kids, one that we'll cherish forever. It's one
that we're trying to enjoy, but at the same time stay focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is easier said than done. Gonzaga is not the center of any
college basketball universe. The school named after St. Aloysius
Gonzaga, a 16th-century Jesuit priest, was founded in 1887.
</P>
<P>
   Other than being the alma mater of John Stockton, the athletic
notoriety of the school is limited. It's only NCAA profile was
sharing the 1950 boxing championship with Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   From the common mispronunciation of the school's name to its
location in Eastern Washington, far from media centers, Gonzaga has
accepted it's out of the limelight status.
</P>
<P>
   After spending nine seasons as an assistant, Monson has been
head coach two seasons and has two NCAA berths and now a Sweet 16
berth on his coaching resume. A Spokane native, Monson appreciates
how far Gonzaga has come more than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost equal to what Washington State did a couple of
years ago,'' said Monson, referring to the school's first Rose Bowl
appearance since 1931. ``We had almost a sense of state pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Monson, like his players, has tried to maintain a sense of
composure, despite celebrations back home and expectations that
have thus far not proven to be unreasonable. ``It's like you're in
the middle of a hurricane and everything is swirling around you and
you're just watching it,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the whirlwind has been the play of guards Hall (5-8) and
Santangelo (6-1), who have provided stability all season.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who arrived at Gonzaga via the Bahamas, thinks his team
has gotten beyond the underdog stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're a Cinderella team,'' he said. ``And we're
not cocky about saying that, just confident. We think that we can
come in here . . . and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they can. If they do, they will undoubtedly have to
carry Cinderella's shoes for a couple of more days, especially if
No. 1 UConn is waiting for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that for Cinderella it always gets to be midnight,''
said Monson. ``We're not looking for midnight. We're looking to
stay dancing all night long.''

DAVIS GOING OUT IN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Somehow it is fitting that what could be the last game
of Tom Davis's coaching career comes against a New England team.
</P>
<P>
   It was in New England, at Boston College (from 1977-82), where
Davis established himself as a major Division 1 college coach.
</P>
<P>
   So if this is it for Davis, who was told earlier this season
that the University of Iowa would not renew his contract, having it
end against old Big East rival UConn somehow would seem right.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there are any guarantees that it will end for Davis and
the Hawkeyes, who are riding an emotional last hurrah.
</P>
<P>
   After all, few people expected the fifth-seeded Hawkeyes (20-9)
to get past fourth seed Arkansas last week in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But they are here, playing in the NCAA West Regional semifinal
against No. 1 seeded UConn as an underdog and a sentimental one at
that.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkeyes have been in that role since Iowa athletic director
Bob Bowsby decided that the 60-year-old Davis, after 13 seasons at
Iowa, no longer fit in the school's long-range basketball plans.
</P>
<P>
   During the up-and-down regular season, as Iowa absorbed injuries
and losses, it did not seem a big deal. Everyone understood Davis
was a lame duck and whether or not you agreed with the decision, it
was a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   It still is, to the point where Southwest Missouri coach (and
former Indiana player) Steve Alford has all but been anointed the
next Iowa coach.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa's success over the weekend in the NCAA Tournament has
caused a mixture of emotions in Iowa City, primarily happiness for
Davis, but also uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   What if Iowa keeps winning, and makes it to the Final Four?
</P>
<P>
   Would the school offer a contract extension with the possibility
that Davis would say no, which would only increase the
embarrassment? Or would it fire a coach who has taken the school to
its first Final Four in 29 years?
</P>
<P>
   Davis says he's not worried about it. Not yet at least. ``I have
no plans other than to reflect,'' he said Wednesday. ``When the
season is over, most of us are wiped out. You're exhausted mentally
and physically. At the end, I will try to reflect and recover and
then see what I want to do and where I want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis says he is enjoying this run as much as he has enjoyed
anything he has done in coaching. ``I tend to live life for the
moment,'' he said. ``I appreciate the experience, but I don't know
if I've approached this season any different than any other time in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa players say they have done their best to separate
Davis's situation from the day-to-day business of the season. It
has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not been really spoken about by the players or coaches,''
said Kent McCausland, Iowa's senior guard. ``It's just been a
subconscious reason to get ready to practice, to get ready to
fight, to play hard, and to leave everything on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after the public practices, UConn coach Jim Calhoun
was in a room talking to members of the CBS staff while Davis
waited outside. When Calhoun came out, Davis said kiddingly, ``You
kept me waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, who has admired the high road Davis has taken publicly
and has called him a role model for all coaches, kidded right back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting a lot of years to have you wait,'' Calhoun
said with laugh that turned into a hug.

RAISING A $320-A-POUND PINCH OF ROSEMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing works as well as freshly picked herbs to gussy up a
modest meal. They grow well in pots and for the most part can be
grown indoors or out. They even stand some neglect.
</P>
<P>
   When space on the windowsill or countertop becomes too crowded,
the leaves can be easily dried in the refrigerator, if one is
patient. I always grow some herbs and am just finishing last fall's
parsley harvest.
</P>
<P>
   However, none of my previous herb growing prepared me for the
$320-a-pound rosemary. It all began in early winter when my local
florist had the most beautiful rosemary topiary just dripping with
irresistible blue flowers.
</P>
<P>
   It was perfect for the winter blahs and would be a wonderfully
fresh adornment on hot lamb dishes. But that cheerful scenario
didn't quite work out.
</P>
<P>
   First the flower buds stopped opening. Not enough light, I
thought, so two fluorescent lights were installed and the pot hung
to receive the maximum exposure. Neither change helped.
</P>
<P>
   Next the leaves began to dry up and fall off, as had the buds,
so I tried the latest soil-care amendments. It got worse.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, at a professional show, The Herb Lady appeared, selling
beautiful rosemary grown in her greenhouse. They need full sun, a
light, sandy soil and alkaline, and they shouldn't be too wet. I
was overwatering, said she, and should let the soil dry out between
waterings. So, I tried that, but it didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be the commercial potting mix of acid peat and wood
chips? I repotted it in lovingly prepared perfect loam and waited
for new shoots. But it was deader than a doornail.
</P>
<P>
   Being a stingy Yankee, I carefully harvested all the dried up
leaves which just filled a one-ounce spice bottle. The plant cost
$20, so a quick calculation revealed that my dried rosemary cost
$320 a pound, not counting the lights.
</P>
<P>
   An ounce of supermarket rosemary in an identical bottle sells
for about $4 (or $64 a pound), which explains why the ship captains
of yore went to the Spice Islands to make their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   What's my $320 lesson? It is: Coddled plants, forced with
fertilizer and bright lights in a commercial greenhouse, suffer
serious shock when moved into a cool, dim house. Used to
scientific, perfect care, a little over or underwatering or other
minor abuse can be fatal. This is more true in potting mix than in
forgiving garden soil.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually many such plants adapt to their new environment and
sprout new leaves, but flowering is harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
   If a plant looks spectacularly better than anything you've ever
been able to grow, it probably won't last. Just think of it as a
temporary visitor, and when it peters out, harvest whatever is
edible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Forcing branches
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make spring come earlier to your house, bring in some
branches for forcing into flower and leaf. Cut long branches with
fat buds. (The flower buds are bigger than the leaf buds.)
</P>
<P>
   Plunge them immediately into a pail or vase of very deep warm
water. After a few days arrange them, cutting the stems under
water. Then wait until they think it's spring and their time to
open. Warmth hastens their perception, sun makes them fade faster.
</P>
<P>
   The classic harbinger of spring is pussy willow, a small tree
that grows in any wet area. The arcane relationships among living
things are fascinating. When a freshly cut willow branch is put in
water, it usually roots, and what's more, if other plants are put
in with it, they, too, often produce roots. Willow produces a
rooting hormone in its sap in springtime and is also a source of
the active ingredient in aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   The plants that burst into flower fastest indoors are those with
the shortest time until their regular outdoor blooming date. For
March cutting, that means those that flower in April. Forsythia and
pussy willow should pop in about two weeks indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Cherries, quince, and peach will take a little longer. Forced
dogwood and crab apples may take a month. Because crabs leaf out
before flowering, they are not as effective as dogwood or cherry,
which flower on bare branches. Late blooming kousa dogwood and
lilacs don't force well.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I cut branches just for their small new leaves. Red
maple is very effective with its tiny red flowers followed by
red-bronze leaves, while the golden branches of weeping willow put
out little chartreuse ones. Branches with baby leaves are great for
flower arrangements, especially with tulips, and best of all, they
can be gathered free.

WHEN YOUR BABY WANTS TO BABY-SIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the typical 10- to 14-year-old who feels like both his world
and his body are chaotic and out of control, baby-sitting may be
the magic elixir.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a powerful self-esteem builder,'' says educational
psychologist Mary Ann Rafoth of Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   After a successful baby-sitting experience, a preteen can feel
better about herself than she did before she walked in the door; a
3-year-old who is thrilled to see her can counteract days, maybe
weeks, of peers who are friends today, enemies tomorrow. Indeed,
sometimes the good feelings can be so powerful that they spill over
into other areas of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen kids who were underperforming academically not be so
down on themselves and perform better,'' says Rafoth.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you know if your middle-school-age child is ready to
baby-sit? How do you maximize potential benefits and minimize
possible dangers? Unfortunately, the most typical yardstick _ a
child's relationship with siblings _ can be misleading, and a
reliable predictor of success _ the match between a child and the
family she is sitting for _ is often ignored.
</P>
<P>
   It took two years of coaxing as well as a certificate from a Red
Cross course before Marina Varshavsky of Lexington, Mass. finally
spoke the words her 13-year-old daughter, Julie Minevich, was dying
to hear: ``OK, I think you're ready to baby-sit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared to death about it,'' says Varshavsky. ``It was a
letting go. She's still my baby, and my baby wants to take care of
someone else's children? What if a child fell and was hurt? What
about Julie's safety? You hear stories, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Varshavsky's fears were soothed by the course Julie took, as
well as by her loving care for her sister, Lana, almost 3.
</P>
<P>
   That there is a developmental need to nurture is partly what
draws a preteen to baby-sitting. But parents in the United States
underrate the importance of providing nurturing opportunities,
whether with siblings, pets, or neighbors, says pediatrician Barry
Zuckerman, chair of pediatrics at Boston University School of
Medicine. ``Parents don't want to burden a child or take time away
from an activity. For a boy, they don't even think of it,'' he
says, even though there is no gender difference on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, if a 12-year-old has a stormy relationship with a
sibling, parents assume that doesn't bode well for sitting. A
rancorous sibling relationship, however, is not the best guide to
whether a preteen will make a good baby-sitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle school is a time when sibling rivalry heightens because
the 10- to 14-year-old is very touchy about possessions and
privacy,'' says Margaret Sagarese, coauthor of ``The Roller Coaster
Years: Raising Your Children Through the Maddening Yet Magical
Middle School Years'' (Broadway).
</P>
<P>
   This touchiness doesn't extend to children outside the family,
however. ``A 13-year-old might go ballistic if a sibling empties
out her wallet,'' she says, ``but she'll think it's cute if a child
in her care does the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another developmental change that can affect readiness
to baby-sit. Sometime between 10 and 12, a new level of cognition
enables a child to see the world differently, as more
adventure-filled but also more dangerous. This can prompt a new set
of worries, particularly around safety and strangers.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a problem for most children, but, Sagarese says,
``You know it's no longer in the normal range if you go to the mall
and he tells you, `Don't park there, it's too dark,' or if he goes
around pulling down all the shades in the house at dark.'' The
child in this overly fearful range probably will not be comfortable
baby-sitting in a strange house, she says.
</P>
<P>
   A general lack of maturity, of course, is another sign a child
is not ready. Parents, however, may not be the best judge of this.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Rapoza, a registered nurse, has been teaching Basic
Baby-sitting at Deaconess-Nashoba Community Hospital in Ayer for 15
years. Every once in a while, she'll spot a child who isn't ready,
usually because he is uncomfortable learning diaper changing or
CPR. When she tells parents, they will often have had a sense he
wasn't ready but were reluctant to act on it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it important for parents to tell a child to wait
when that's appropriate _ a good experience can boost self-esteem,
but a bad one can deflate it _ it's also critical for a child to
know how to judge if a family is a good match for her and to be
able to negotiate parameters: what she's capable of doing, how much
she's paid, how many and what ages of children she can care for.
</P>
<P>
   This is an important focus of Rapoza's class. ``They need to
feel empowered to say they can't come back if parents expect too
much or if a child is too hard to handle,'' she says. A baby-sitter
may love the idea of an infant, for instance, but be unnerved at
how much he cries.
</P>
<P>
   She poses all sorts of ``what-would-you-do-if?'' scenarios: What
if a child doesn't want to do what you want him to do? (Find a way
to compromise.) What if neighborhood kids come over to play, too?
(Send them home nicely; otherwise, they're your responsibility.)
What if a parent has been drinking and you're not comfortable
having her drive you home? (Stand your ground and call your parent,
even if they get angry.)
</P>
<P>
   While parents might think such scenarios would worry or frighten
a child, Sagarese says the opposite is true: hashing out problem
situations in class enhances their real-life decision-making
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful muscle for them to have to flex, to have to
decide if they can read another book to a 4-year-old or insist it's
time to turn out the light. Talking about it in advance helps them
to trust their own judgment,'' she says. As for the worst-case
scenarios, ``It's not as if they don't think these thoughts
themselves,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as much as Rapoza throws out tricky what-if's, children
throw tougher ones at her. A recent one that stunned her came from
a 13-year-old boy. ``What if a child confides he is being abused by
a parent?'' he asked, and then acknowledged that a boy in his care
had told him just that. He told the class that he told his mom, and
she helped the child and his mother get help.
</P>
<P>
   Asking your parents for advice is almost always the right thing
to do, Rapoza tells children. She tells parents that the commitment
we must make to our child who baby-sits is no small thing. ``You
need to be reachable whenever your child sits,'' she says. ``Even
if nothing goes wrong, knowing he can call you is a security
blanket.'' If he calls, give advice over the phone but don't rush
over to rescue him unless it's an emergency. ``That undermines the
independence and competency he is trying to gain,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Since she's been sitting, Julie sees a difference in her
self-confidence. ``I was always shy talking to grown-ups,'' she
says. ``When I'm doing a job, I feel respected. I can talk to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of her success, Julie mentions the $500 she's earned
in nine months. She's saved most of it, but she can spend some as
she wishes, on nail polish or gifts for friends. This financial
independence is another benefit of baby-sitting. ``Having
experience making decisions about money adds to a preteen's
decision-making capability,'' says Sagarese.
</P>
<P>
   Julie's mother notices other pluses, too, particularly an
increased sense of responsibility. Not only does Julie keep a card
file with each family's vital information, but she also is managing
her time well. ``One of the conditions for baby-sitting was that
homework didn't get neglected,'' says Varshavsky.
</P>
<P>
   That an 11- to 14-year-old takes the responsibility of
baby-sitting so seriously is a hallmark of the age. ``There's a lot
of identity formation and skill mastery going on,'' says Rafoth.
She thinks preteens make excellent sitters. So does Rapoza, who
says, ``It's not just a job to a child this age; there's nothing
ho-hum about it for them. Plus, they want to engage the children.
That's part of the appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing this for the money,'' says Julie Minevich. ``I
do it because I really love it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --If you can't meet the parents your child is going to baby-sit
for, at least introduce yourself over the phone to find out what
their expectations are. Then you can help your child determine if
this is a good match.
</P>
<P>
   --Baby-sitting is as important for boys as it is for girls.
</P>
<P>
   --A child who wants to sit but isn't ready can phase into it by:
working as a mother's helper; assisting an older friend while she
sits; sitting first during the day only.
</P>
<P>
   --If you are hiring a preteen, consider a baby-sitting course a
prerequisite. Before you leave him with your children, have him
watch them while you're home, especially if you have a baby.
</P>
<P>
   --Many communities offer baby-sitting courses sponsored by the
American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   --The closer your children are in age, the less likely you can
leave one to baby-sit the other. If they are both willing, leave
each in charge of himself, with specific, age-appropriate
responsibilities spelled out beforehand.

PAINT THINNER CLEANS WOOD, AND METAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have an old wood chair in which you can see the grain of
the wood, but it is dirty and tired-looking. How can I clean it?
Also, I have a metal bar stool that is tired-looking, too. How can
I clean that one? It is not rusting.
</P>
<P>
   CAROL DRISCOLL, Randolph, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Paint thinner to the rescue, for both the chair and the
stool. Apply liberally with a cloth, let it sit for a minute or
two, but don't let it evaporate. Then scrub with the same cloth and
rub dry with a new cloth. This will clean the wood but dull the
finish; you can bring back some of the shine by buffing with a dry
cloth. If the finish is still dull, you can sand it lightly and
apply one or two coats of an oil-based, semigloss polyurethane
varnish.
</P>
<P>
   For stubborn dirt on the stool, dip fine steel wool in the paint
thinner and rub lightly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having a new roof put on my house. I also have to have
the chimney repointed. What should be done first?
</P>
<P>
   BERNIE KEENAN, West Roxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the repointing should be done first; that way, any
damage to the shingles by the masons repointing the chimney will be
covered by the new roof.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having four dormers on my two-family house covered with
vinyl. Will the workmen wreck the roof when they are working up
there?
</P>
<P>
   HUMPHREY GRADY, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. They won't wreck the roof if they do it right, and the right
way is to put up scaffolding so they can stand on that instead of
the roof. If they have to stand on the roof, then they should put
down a big piece of plywood or other protective cover to stand on.
Twisting and turning shoes can really do a job on asphalt shingles,
so the right way _ scaffolding or plywood sheets _ is important.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My hardwood floor was installed in November 1997 and treated
with water-based polyurethane varnish. Now the boards are opening
up, enough to be unsightly, and the varnish is cracking in the
gaps. Did I do something wrong? Can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL SOULE, Newburyport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You did nothing wrong, neither did the installers, and the
boards were installed at the right time of year: November, when
they were at their driest and smallest. All wood floors should be
installed this way. Then when they gain moisture and expand, they
will be even tighter; and when they dry out and contract, they
won't contract so much as to open up. Thousands of floors have been
installed this way without problems.
</P>
<P>
   All I can think of is that your hardwood had excessive moisture
when it was installed (20 percent water content is considered
ideal), so that when they dried out, they contracted more than
normal, creating the gaps. Treating with water-based varnish has
nothing to do with it, although I feel oil-based varnish is better
to use on floors.
</P>
<P>
   The cure? You can't fill the gaps with any hardening material
because it will break up with future expansion and contraction.
Filling the gaps with wood is not practical because the gaps are
very shallow, and the results would be unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Stop me if you've heard this one, but the only real, permanent
cure is to take up the boards now and relay them tight. It can be
done, but it is a lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   When you revarnish, use water-based again, because oil-based is
incompatible with the water-based varnish on the wood now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My concrete foundation has a crack from one of the windows
down to the footing. I've had three offers to fix it; one man said
he would enlarge the crack and inject epoxy, but he could do it
``tomorrow.'' Another would inject a hydrophobic material; the
third would inject a hydrophilic material. What is the best?
</P>
<P>
   JACKIE COONS, North Hampton, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. I can't say what is best, but all three suggest injecting a
material, which is good, if they work, because they do not require
digging down on the outside and patching the crack. All three
techniques should also enlarge the crack, because it is difficult
to inject anything into a hairline or very small crack. Hydrophobic
means incapable of uniting with or absorbing water; it will reject
water. Hydrophilic means capable of uniting with or absorbing
water; it will stop the leak by accommodating the water.
</P>
<P>
   So, take your chances with any of the three, although I would be
leery of anyone who says he can do it ``tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The grout between the new ceramic tiles on my kitchen floor
is bleeding onto the tiles. The tile people suggested removing it
with SOS pads and a toothbrush. Will that work?
</P>
<P>
   KATHY MAHONEY, Roslindale, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I doubt it. If the grout bleed is a haze, then rubbing it
with a dry cloth will take it off. So will SOS pads. But if there
are bits of grout on the tile that are not coming off, then here's
the ony cure: Buy muriatic acid in a hardware store, mix it half
and half with water, and apply to the grout. The acid will attack
the lime in the grout (you will see the grout fizz up like an
Alka-Seltzer pill in water), and you can rub the rest off. A
warning about muriatic acid, or any acid, for that matter: Use
extreme caution, and wear skin and eye protection. When mixing acid
with water, always pour the acid into the water.

TEXAS ISLE MERCHANTS BLAME COSTS, COMPETITION FOR STUDENT DECLINE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: S.C.) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas _ The sun-bronzed hordes of college
students thronging to this narrow island couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   Spring break, South Padre-style, is a nonstop beach party fueled
by mass quantities of cold beer and icy margaritas _ a bacchanalian
romp from bikini pageants, wet T-shirt contests and topless
bungi-cord jumping to jet ski and parasail rides, concerts and
tug-of-war competitions. And collegians not old enough to drink
legally in Texas can party 25 minutes away in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The island's Visitor and Convention Bureau expects at least
125,000 students to dump an estimated $68.8 million into local cash
registers this spring break season.
</P>
<P>
   So why are so many island merchants glum?
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, up to this point, spring break has been dying,''
laments Mike Lemmons, manager of Amberjacks Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons, a South Padre resident since 1976, blames the decline
on the island's relatively high cost for hotels and condos, along
with increasing competition from other resorts for the millions of
dollars that college kids spread around. And MTV is not featuring
South Padre as it did during last year's spring break programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rates are really high, and plus there's Cancun (Mexico),
there's Panama City (Fla.),'' Lemmons said. ``There's a lot more
places to go now than what there was say 10 years ago when it was
basically us, Daytona Beach and Fort Lauderdale.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the visitors bureau say they expect the same
number of students as in 1998. To lure them, the bureau spent
$150,000 to insert color brochures in newspapers in a dozen large
Midwestern universities, and radio station promotions offered
all-expenses-paid trips for two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're hot this year, because of word of mouth,'' said
Cindy Dubois, the bureau spokeswoman. ``Panama Beach is probably
going to be real big this year, and so is Cancun. And MTV was in
Jamaica last year, and it might be hot this year.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV producers originally said they would return to South Padre
this year after island officials agreed to pony up $85,000 to cover
production costs, Dubois explained. But the producers changed their
minds, opting instead to cover spring break from cruise ships
calling on Cancun and Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Dubois conceded that the December 1994 peso devaluation, and
resulting bargain prices at Mexican coastal resorts, knocked the
island's spring break crowd down to what is considered a historic
low of 110,000 visitors in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has sort of been crawling back ever since,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials in Florida's top resort said foreign
competition has caused them not to expect the 500,000 or 600,000
students who visited last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring break is a fickle market. It tends to move around,''
said Dan Stark, president of the Panama City Convention and
Visitors Bureau. ``We're probably down 15 or 20 percent, and some
of that has to do with MTV not coming here ... and not being quite
as affordable as Cancun or Jamaica.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the official attendance figures touted in Texas,
which tourism officials say are calculated from city hotel tax
receipts, several Padre Island merchants agreed with Lemmons that
the much-ballyhooed financial spring break bonanza falls short of
its billing.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I've seen less and less numbers (of students) since 1991, and
that is counter to some of the claims I've heard, but the sales
don't warrant those claims,'' said Verne Lewis, a former Houstonian
who owns a clothing and jewelry store called Isla.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis visited Panama City last January to satisfy his curiosity
about the resort South Padre considers its major U.S. rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw was a budget-oriented spring break destination, and
that's what the kids want,'' said Lewis, adding hotel prices on
South Padre during the peak week can reach $250 a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see the quality I thought Florida would offer, in
terms of environment and amenities. I saw a lot of mom-and-pop
motels that kids could rent for $60 a night,'' Lewis said. ``I
guess prices are the main reason kids have stopped coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, most South Padre Island hotels and condos were
booked. But those who were able to secure lodging did so at a
fairly competitive price. At the Radisson Hotel on the beach, for
example, four students could book a room for $170 a night total.
Condos operated by the same hotel ran about $360 a night for six
people.
</P>
<P>
   But students who went to Florida last year agreed it was less
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we stayed for five days in Panama Beach and it was
cheaper,'' said Amy Suppinger, a 22-year-old senior at Clemson
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crazy. We stayed in a place that was full of kids and
it was nonstop party,'' she recalled. ``And there were a lot more
spring break deals. You could get wrist bands where you'd get a
free drink or get in without paying the cover.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, Suppinger and 10 other classmates drove 22
hours from South Carolina to South Padre, wanting a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida _ been there, done that,'' said Peter Olson Jr., 23,
as he added to the waist-high stack of empty beer cans along the
kitchen wall of a beach condo he's sharing with five other
students. ``It's something with a different twist,'' he said of
South Padre. ``Many more new bars and hot women!''
</P>
<P>
   Olson and the other Clemson students gave South Padre high marks
for the diversity of events _ both during the day on the beach and
at night in the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ayer, a 22-year-old senior, said he went to Key West,
Fla., last spring break and ``the only thing you could do was jump
from bar to bar and drink alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many more activities here, like the bungi jumping
and the games on the beach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while spring break overall might not bring the windfall
merchants would like, this week things are definitely hopping on
the island.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``Texas Week,'' when most major universities in the state
take their midterm break. And this year Texas Week coincides with
recess at other large universities in Michigan, Kansas and Iowa.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; By mid-week, merchants were busy and guardedly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``With us, as the years have gone by, spring break becomes less
and less important,'' said Susan Bagley, who owns On The Beach surf
shop and the upscale Calypso gift shop with husband, Gene.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, this year spring break seems better than last year
and I don't know why that is. They (students) seem to have a little
bit more money, they're staying on the island more, and there's
more of them.''  &UR;

ACADEMY AWARDS: GUESSING THE INEVITABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do not take this article seriously. And while you're at it,
don't take the Oscars seriously, either.
</P>
<P>
   Whoopi Goldberg is hosting this year's event; expect lots of
jokes about war movies and period movies and Shakespeare in tights.
Expect strange clothing and stranger hairdos. Expect pomp.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect too much from the awards themselves. The Oscars
never make much sense, particularly to folks who try to predict
them. Which, of course, we're about to do: Predict the Academy
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast which films and filmmakers will walk away with the big
gold dude. Prognosticate. Foretell. Prophesy. Guess.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, with a perfunctory rub of the crystal ball, we here
present a list of Wild Guesses for six major Academy Award
categories: best picture, actress, supporting actress, actor,
supporting actor and director. Each Wild Guess is followed by a
Lovable Underdog, which is then followed by an official Pithy
Commentary replete with obtuse journalistic thinking.
</P>
<P>
   So read on. Have fun. And lighten up, all right? It's only the
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PICTURE
</P>
<P>
   The Nominees: ``Elizabeth,'' ``Life is Beautiful,'' ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``The Thin Red Line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Guess:``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lovable Underdog: ``Life is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pithy Commentary: In the race between ``Saving Private
Ryan'' and ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``Ryan'' will probably win by a
nose despite the fact that ``Shakespeare'' earned more nominations
overall (13, compared with ``Ryan's'' 11). One reason: ``Ryan'' had
bigger box office ($208 million, compared with ``Shakespeare's''
$66 million).
</P>
<P>
   Another: ``Shakespeare in Love,'' for all its hyper-literate
chest-heaving, is a comedy. And Oscar snubs comedies.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   The Nominees: Cate Blanchett, ``Elizabeth''; Fernanda
Montenegro, ``Central Station''; Gwyneth Paltrow, ``Shakespeare in
Love''; Meryl Streep, ``One True Thing''; Emily Watson, ``Hilary
and Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Guess: Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   The Lovable Underdog: Fernanda Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The Pithy Commentary: How many Oscars has Meryl Streep already
won? Two. How many will she have after Sunday? Three. Why? Because
she gets cancer and dies in ``One True Thing'' (and Oscar loves
illness). Because this is her 11th nomination. Because she last won
in 1982, seven nominations ago. And because she deserves it.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Academy may decide that Paltrow's star turn in
``Shakespeare'' is just too yummy to ignore (and Oscar loves
yummy).
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   The Nominees: Kathy Bates, ``Primary Colors''; Brenda Blethyn,
``Little Voice''; Judi Dench, ``Shakespeare in Love''; Rachel
Griffiths, ``Hilary and Jackie''; Lynn Redgrave, ``Gods and
Monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Guess: Rachel Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   The Lovable Underdog: Lynn Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   The Pithy Commentary: Do you remember The Rule in this category?
No? Well, we'll repeat it for you: For best supporting actress, the
Academy generally chooses whichever nominee its male constituents
would most like to sleep with. Exceptions tend to be comic foils or
esteemed character actors (Linda Hunt, Dianne Wiest) which,
considering the esteemed character work of Bates, Blethyn, Dench
and Redgrave, would seem to blow the category wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Dench was nominated and lost in '98 (Blethyn in '97), so who
knows?
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   The Nominees: Roberto Benigni, ``Life is Beautiful''; Tom Hanks,
``Saving Private Ryan''; Ian McKellen, ``Gods and Monsters''; Nick
Nolte, ``Affliction''; Edward Norton, ``American History X.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Guess: Nick Nolte.
</P>
<P>
   The Lovable Underdog: Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   The Pithy Commentary: Benigni's a comedian (plus he's Italian),
Norton's performance was seen by only 12 or 13 people, and Hanks'
mantelpiece is already crowded with Oscars imagine the headache if
he had to make room for a third. McKellen has a chance (he is a
Sir, after all), but Nolte has the edge: He yells louder. And he
pulls out his tooth with a wrench in ``Affliction.''
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   The Nominees: James Coburn, ``Affliction''; Robert Duvall, ``A
Civil Action''; Ed Harris, ``The Truman Show''; Geoffrey Rush,
``Shakespeare in Love''; Billy Bob Thornton, ``A Simple Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Guess: James Coburn.
</P>
<P>
   The Adorable Underdog: Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   The Pithy Commentary: Ed Harris' role is too small. Robert
Duvall already owns an Oscar; so does Geoffrey Rush. Billy Bob
Thornton rubs people the wrong way (besides, he won a screenplay
Oscar for ``Sling Blade''). That leaves James Coburn, who's never
been nominated (much less won) and is now riding a cool Hollywood
comeback. If, on the other hand, Academy members are still feeling
guilty about Duvall's best-actor loss last year, he may find
himself clutching Oscar No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   BEST DIRECTOR
</P>
<P>
   The Nominees: Roberto Benigni, ``Life is Beautiful''; Steven
Spielberg, ``Saving Private Ryan''; John Madden, ``Shakespeare in
Love''; Terrence Malick, ``The Thin Red Line''; Peter Weir, ``The
Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Guess: Terrence Malick.
</P>
<P>
   The Lovable Underdog:
</P>
<P>
   Peter Weir.
</P>
<P>
   The Pithy Commentary: Most of time, who wins the directing Oscar
depends on what wins the best picture Oscar which means either
Spielberg or Madden will walk away with the statue. But every now
and then, the Academy will veer wildly from the norm, instead
honoring some well-admired auteur whose film has zilch chance of
winning best picture. Ergo Malick.

 &HT;        OFFICE OF MOTOR CARRIERS NEEDS BETTER DATA, FASTER ACTION,
DOT INSPECTOR GENERAL SAYS   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, March 18 -- As the number of deaths from large truck
crashes is growing, the agency that regulates trucking safety
continues to be weighed down by data problems and slow action,
national transportation safety officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Transportation Inspector General Kenneth Mead told
a congressional panel Wednesday that the Office of Motor Carriers
collects insufficient data on crashes. Also, he said the OMC moves
too slowly in implementing safety programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``OMC still cannot target all carriers with the worst safety
records because its database is incomplete and inaccurate and data
entry is not timely,'' Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   Those were just a few of the findings national transportation
regulators highlighted at a hearing that examined the OMC's role in
truck safety. The federal government oversees more than 490,000
trucking businesses and 6 million drivers. OMC collects crash data
and citations to identify problem carriers with the worst records
and study the causes of crashes.
</P>
<P>
   While the rate of fatalities per 100 miles traveled by large
trucks has stayed steady in the last few years, the number of
actual deaths has increased. Deaths have jumped 20 percent from
4,462 in 1992 to 5,355 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   OMC is unlikely to meet its goal for 1999 of reducing the number
of fatalities to fewer than 5,126. That was the number of deaths
three years ago, said Phyllis Scheinberg, associate director of
Transportation Issues for the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, if current trends continue, Scheinberg predicts there
will be about 5,800 deaths related to large truck accidents in
1999. The federal government defines a large truck as having at
least 6 wheels and weighing more than 10,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   OMC also fell short in its data collection from the states. For
example, the agency did not receive data from states on 38 percent
of truck and bus crashes in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some states did not record the information properly or in
a usable format, Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   Mead said in his review of OMC, he found the same problem areas
that have challenged transportation safety officials for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Yogi Berra said, it's 'deja vu all over again','' Mead
said. ``Thirty years ago, there were too few trucks being inspected
and too many trucks were found unsafe for operations. These are the
same concerns we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   More inspectors are needed at the U.S.-Mexico border, just one
area that needs more attention, Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   About 44 percent of trucks entering the U.S. from Mexico do not
meet American safety standards, Mead said. He pointed to El Paso,
Texas, where there is only one inspector at a point where 1,300
trucks enter the country daily. An inspector can conduct about 10
or 14 inspections a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``OMC and the border states disagree over who has responsibility
for these inspections,'' Mead said. ``Therefore there has been
little improvement. It is time to resolve this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   To bring down the number of deaths, Mead suggested: improving
driver accountability, requiring more vehicle inspections, and
setting a 60 mile maximum speed limit for trucks.

SEATTLE MUSEUM SHOWS BREAKTHROUGH OF POSTWAR ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID BONETTI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Among contemporary art collectors, Virginia and Bagley
Wright have achieved an enviable reputation for intelligence,
community responsibility and good taste.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, part of the widespread approbation the Wrights enjoy
stems from the fact that they reside in Seattle, far from the
corridors of art-world power (and gossip), where they have been
able to pursue their collecting activity without constant scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The current exhibition celebrating them and the collection they
have assembled over a 45-year period (at the Seattle Art Museum
through May 9) demonstrates, however, that the universal praise
they and their collection receive is well-merited.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the collection seems a rather impersonal survey
of artmaking in the United States from the early 1940s to the
present, with the late entry of German art in the '80s. Abstract
expressionism, minimalism, Pop, color field painting,
neo-expressionism and post-modern irony and criticality all make
appearances, frequently with excellent examples of work by major
artists.
</P>
<P>
   The installation, overseen by SAM curator Trevor Fairbrother,
eschews chronological display for a spicier arrangement based on
theme and affinity. (The small addendum that inaugurates the
Wrights' private exhibition space in a renovated warehouse on the
edge of Seattle's downtown follows a similar pattern.)
</P>
<P>
   First appearances are, however, frequently incorrect, and
although the collection intentionally reflects postwar art trends _
the Wrights plan for it eventually to form the core of SAM's
permanent collection of late 20th century art _ it is far from
impersonal. This is not a cookie-cutter collection assembled
overnight by socially ambitious arrivistes who use an expensive art
collection as their best chance of breaching society's walls; it is
one that reflects a personal sensibility actively engaged with the
art and ideas of our time.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the Wrights have purchased new work by young
artists. Although they have on occasion bought work as ancient as
25 years old in order to plug a gap, correct an oversight or help
undo a regretted sale _ under the influence of formalist pooh-bah
Clement Greenberg, they sold a number of Pop classics in the '70s _
they generally avoid second-guessing their own original instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wrights' main strategy behind the collection is to buy
work by promising artists when it is most affordable,'' Fairbrother
writes in his catalog essay. ``This proved successful from an
investment perspective, and has produced a rich assembly that spans
many artistic styles and several generations of artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Wrights, people of means who have dominated Seattle
society since the 1950s, had to economize. On both sides, Virginia
Bloedel Wright comes from families enriched by timber fortunes.
After stints as a journalist, Bagley Wright made his own in real
estate. His company built the Space Needle that symbolized the 1962
Seattle World's Fair and still dominates the city's skyline.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '50s, the Wrights, bright and intellectually
engaged 20-year olds, met in New York City, where both were
exploring their interests. Virginia had studied art history at
Columbia and was working for Sidney Janis, the dealer whose gallery
showed Picasso, Leger, Mondrian and young Americans like Jackson
Pollock.
</P>
<P>
   It was a culturally heady time, and in a charming memoir written
for the catalog, Bagley brings the period to life.
</P>
<P>
   Janis was the greatest influence on Virginia's collecting
philosophy. From him she learned to purchase only works by artists
who had begun to attract serious critical attention and who had
begun to perform on the art market, and to choose the best
available example of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Putting that philosophy into action, the 23-year old Virginia
purchased Mark Rothko's ``Number 10'' in 1952, the year it was
painted. A classic in Rothko's development of his signature style
of floating clouds of color in a vague, unspecified space, it set
the pattern for future acquisitions. Soon, she bought new paintings
by Joseph Albers, Willem de Kooning and Northwest painters Mark
Tobey and Morris Graves. In 1955, the newly married couple was
featured in a national magazine article written by Sam Hunter on a
surprising new area of collecting: contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   After their marriage, the Wrights relocated to Seattle, where
they quickly became engaged with what was then a provincial art
scene, loaning works, organizing exhibitions, funding works of
public sculpture. Through the years, by action and example, they
helped transform what was a pioneer town with little interest in
culture into a more sophisticated city where art, theater and opera
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Their collection, some 250 works in all mediums, about 100 of
which are on view in the two venues, will give SAM one of the most
well-balanced assemblages of postwar American art of any West Coast
museum.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes works by Rothko, Philip Guston, de
Koonings, Franz Kline, among others.

WISDOM FROM THE RICH: NO TAX BREAKS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The headline on the press release looks like a
joke: ``Wealthy Taxpayers say, `No Thanks!' to GOP Tax Giveaways.''
</P>
<P>
   Could this be real? A national consortium of 400 fat cats,
calling themselves ``Responsible Wealth,'' who publicly condemn the
benefits of several proposed tax break bills that would benefit
them most?
</P>
<P>
   Such protest is expected from low-income, high-outrage
anti-capitalists, but not from women and men who sit very
comfortably in the country's top 5 percent income bracket.
</P>
<P>
   But Responsible Wealth is real. Based in Boston and part of an
advocacy group called United for a Fair Economy, the members of
Responsible Wealth say they are committed to turning back the tide
of greed that Congress has helped to flood the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 135 of them put their money where their condemnation
is and gave away $1.2 million worth of 1997 tax breaks they'd
received. Most of the donated money, they say, went to social
justice organizations and other nonprofit groups dedicated to a
fairer economy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 135 is Michele McGeoy, who made a bundle in 1993 when
she sold her software company in Berkeley, Calif., Tailored
Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Now the director of a nonprofit organization called ASAP, which
donates technology and training to public high school students and
welfare-to-work women, McGeoy said she couldn't stomach the idea of
receiving special tax privileges just because she's already rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be ashamed to pay less taxes on my stock sales than a
nursing home aide or child care worker pays on what she earns for
caring for people all day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other members of Responsible Wealth, giving back some
of her good fortune is not enough for McGeoy; she wants to tackle
some of what she terms ``the root causes'' of our decidedly skewed
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the philanthropy in the world just perpetuates the cycle
until we look at the rules that are set up to favor people with
wealth,'' McGeoy said. ``Now that I'm in this position (wealthy), I
see these rules that are allegedly in our favor but that I don't
think are actually healthy for our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of those rules _ proposed tax-break bills that would make
the McGeoys among us even fatter cats _ are especially offensive to
the group. They know that, despite talk of ``surpluses,'' a tax cut
for the haves almost always results in an economic penalty for the
have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   The nastiest proposals:
</P>
<P>
   _ Repeal of the capital gains tax on individuals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Repeal of the estate or inheritance tax.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 10 percent tax cut for all taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 percent tax cut proposal is the inspiration of House
Budget Committee Chairman John R. Kasich, R-Ohio. It looks
non-discriminatory and fair, but, as the Responsible Wealth folks
point out, nearly two-thirds of the ``giveback'' would go to the
wealthiest 10 percent of U.S. households who'd average about
$20,700 per break.
</P>
<P>
   For taxpayers who make less than $38,000 per year _ 60 percent
of individual income taxpayers _ the average break would be a
measly $99.
</P>
<P>
   The two pending tax repeals are the creation of Rep. Joe
Knollenberg, R-Mich. Responsible Wealth says both proposals should
be identified for what they are: more privilege for the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 percent of U.S. households possess substantial enough
estates even to owe taxes, so Knollenberg's proposal to do away
with estate taxes affects only a rarefied, monied group.
</P>
<P>
   How substantial? Thanks to the big heart of Congress, currently
no estate smaller than $1 million can be taxed. If Congress passes
the repeal, the planet Pluto will be the limit; a person can
inherit billions and pay nary a penny for the windfall.
</P>
<P>
   As for Knollenberg's other proposed tax repeal, capital gains
tax cuts already have made for fatter fat cats. If the tax is
completely wiped out, even more of the nation's tax burden will be
switched from wealthy shoulders _ the richest 10 percent of
Americans possess 87 percent of all individually owned stocks _ to
the bent backs of the workaday wage earner.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the wealthiest 1 percent of households averaged a
$7,680 capital gains tax cut and grabbed two-thirds of all benefits
from the reductions. Meanwhile, the lower 80 percent of U.S.
households realized an average capital gains tax cut of $6.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if most of the people she knows in her income bracket
think she's nuts for her allegiance to Responsible Wealth, Michele
McGeoy laughed and said, ``Yeah, pretty much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not the popular stance to take. It's not what
people want to hear,'' she said. ``But until people like me do
something about it, things are never going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's no joke.

STREET THEATER GROUP DRAWS FIRE FROM CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD and RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, celebrating
20 years of campy outrage, street theater, poor taste and good
works, has drawn fire from the San Francisco Catholic Archdiocese
for planning its anniversary party on Easter Sunday and closing
down a city street to hold it.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese wants the city's Board of Supervisors to
reconsider its blessing of the April 4 event, but two key
supervisors have said there's no chance of that.
</P>
<P>
   Archdiocese spokesman Maurice Healy said the closing of a public
street on Easter, Christiandom's holiest day, for a group that
``mocks the Catholic church'' is tantamount to allowing a group of
neo-Nazis to close a street on Passover.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the supervisors to rescind their 8-0 vote on March 1 to
permit the Sisters' street fair, saying it showed ``extraordinary
insensitivity to people of all faiths.''
</P>
<P>
   Healy also said Catholics for Truth and Justice, a grass-roots
organization that ``traditionally has taken a role when the church
has been defamed or attacked,'' may take action as well.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over their 20th birthday celebration came as a
surprise to the Sisters, even though they are no strangers to
protests. The street theater group consists of some 30 gay,
lesbian, transgender and straight members who dress in nuns' habits
and take to the streets for the shock, outrage and amusement of
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really know that the archdiocese had feelings about
this,'' Sister Ann R. Key said. ``I think they're taking it too
seriously. We take our work seriously but we don't take ourselves
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Ann said her group planned no form of protest,
demonstration or condemnation of the Catholic Church during the
event but were focusing instead on a long-standing goal of
providing aid to the poor, homeless, young, and gay and lesbian
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically a bunch of do-gooders,'' she said. ``Speaking
out of hate would not get us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The offices of board President Tom Ammiano and Supervisor Mark
Leno, who sponsored the resolution to close a block of Castro
Street here, have received an avalanche of calls protesting the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners attending Mass on Sunday were given copies of a
commentary by Wade Hughan, vice chairman of Catholics for Truth and
Justice, which said ``only the Catholic Church could be the target
of such officially sanctioned ridicule, deliberately scheduled so
as to add insult to injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughan added, ``Members of the board (of supervisors) would be
falling over each other to be the first to condemn a march by the
Ku Klux Klan on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, or a rally by
the American Nazi Party on Yom Kippur. We would not be hearing any
bold defenses of free speech at those hearings. Somehow we are
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Its bid for a permit to close Castro Street was denied last
month by the Department of Parking and Traffic, which raised
traffic and parking concerns, as well as worries of merchants about
business disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   But on March 1, the supervisors voted 8-0 on a resolution by
Ammiano and Leno to permit the closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I completely understand and respect that all people may not
warm up to the Sisters,'' Leno said, adding he did not expect the
board to reconsider. ``But I think part of the uproar is lack of
familiarity with who they are and what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're an all-volunteer organization that raises money and
does good deeds for smaller non-profit organizations. They work on
behalf of improving the health of our community. They do it with
humor and they touch on a very delicate subject (religion). And
that's where some feathers are ruffled. But they mean no disrespect
and they certainly do good work.''
</P>
<P>
   Healy said the Sisters do mean disrespect to the church, noting
they practice something called the ``condom savior mass,'' which
denigrates the sacred Mass. He also said the Sisters mocked the
pope with a theatrical exorcism in Union Square during his 1997
visit here.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano also said the supervisors would not reconsider their
vote.

AUBURN'S BASKETBALL SUCCESS HELPS SALVE FOOTBALL MISFORTUNES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Who would have believed that a basketball
team could mend hearts broken by the passionate fans who still
speak the names Pat Sullivan and Bo Jackson in reverent terms?
</P>
<P>
   ``This season has meant a lot to a lot of people,'' said forward
Bryant Smith of the Auburn Tigers, the NCAA Tournament South
Region's top-seeded team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our season came at a perfect time. It was a down time for our
university and for our fans. Football didn't do well, and Auburn is
looked at as a football school. Now, people are noticing Auburn
once again, for different reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn fans again have reason to cheer after being stunned by
the midseason resignation of football coach Terry Bowden, a 3-8
season and the embarrassing buyout of its scheduled 1999
season-opening football game with Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our season has picked up the spirit all around campus,''
agreed Scott Pohlman, hero of last week's 81-74 victory against
Oklahoma State that thrust the Tigers into the Sweet 16 for the
first time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put a value on what this team has done for Auburn
University,'' coach Cliff Ellis said. ``People are proud of this
team, and that helps Auburn in more ways than just selling out
(Beard-Eaves) coliseum and making money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allowed the Auburn family to heal. Our season has been good
for Auburn football, good for the chemistry department. Good for
Terry Bowden and good for (new football coach) Tommy Tuberville
because this team has been the center of national attention. It's
pushed all the controversy to page three or four. And it has been a
season of history as far as our program is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers (29-3) set a school record for victories, won the
Southeastern Conference championship for the first time in 39
seasons and set home attendance records. Its No. 2 national ranking
(Feb. 22) after starting the season 19-0 was the highest an Auburn
team had been ranked in 40 years. Auburn became only the ninth team
in NCAA Tournament history to be awarded a No. 1 seed after a
season when it was not in the 64-team field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten the attention of all America,'' Ellis said.
``We've been the Cinderella story from Day One. Our media has
crowned this the best (basketball) team in the history of Alabama.
What we've accomplished goes a long way toward establishing our
basketball program.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, who already has been selected national coach of the year
by one publication, first burst on the tournament scene with his
South Alabama teams in 1979-80. He then breathed life into the
Clemson program, where his sixth team won the first-ever ACC
championship in 1990 and reached the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis had taken three of his four previous Auburn teams to the
postseason National Invitation Tournament. This is a team of stars
that plays together. Forward Chris Porter and point guard Doc
Robinson made the all-SEC first team. Bryant, the only senior, made
the second team and 7-foot center Mamadou N'diaye the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers have one more plateau to reach. Auburn's most
successful tournament team was led to the 1986 Elite Eight by Chuck
Person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get into that,'' Ellis said. ``We've faced questions
like that all year. This team has defied all odds. It's won a
Southeastern Conference championship, finished fourth in the
country, it's in the Sweet 16 after not being ranked (in
preseason). It's a great basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what will happen against Ohio State. But I
think it will be a beautiful game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's already been a beautiful season. Even at Auburn. nn

CALIFORNIA BEAVERS FIND REFUGE, FOR NOW, IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZEKE MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOERNE, Texas _ Four beavers exiled from California are being
freed at an undisclosed location in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys just need somewhere that is compatible in the wild
and welcoming,'' said Lynn Cuny of Wildlife Rescue and
Rehabilitation near Boerne, where the refugees played in an
enclosure earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Some landowners here have agreed to take the beavers, joining
hundreds of thousands of their wood-chewing, creek-damming Texas
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, those cousins are the target of an aggressive state
eradication program.
</P>
<P>
   The critters were among 16 beavers trapped at a reserve in
Riverside County, Calif., where their appetite for native trees put
them on the least-wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   The beavers were evicted this week from the 13,000-acre reserve
to protect the habitat of an endangered bird, the Bell's vireo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the beaver, which are not a species of
concern, were impacting the habitat of species that we do have some
concern for,'' said Mike McBride of the California Fish and Game
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Picketers protested last month after officials said the beavers
would be killed if new homes couldn't be found.
</P>
<P>
   Cuny, who has a permit to import mammals and release them on
private land in Texas, stepped in to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled. These are wild beavers, and they have the
chance to be wild again,'' said Jane Garrison of the Los Angeles
chapter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which paid
$1,000 to fly the beavers to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But the welcoming committee didn't include animal control
specialists and those all too familiar with the pesky critters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beavers cause millions of dollars of damage each year,
predominantly in East Texas,'' said Gary Nunley, director of the
Texas Wildlife Damage Management Service. ``They burrow into banks,
weakening dams and highway foundations and dikes and even railroad
track beds. Their dams flood county roads, plug culverts, and a lot
of timber dies in standing water.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, state legislators approved hiring five ``beaver
specialists'' to corral the flat-tailed troublemakers, and 4,118
beavers were killed last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest number we've had in a long time,'' Nunley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Word that West Coast beavers were coming to Texas didn't sit
well with Houston County agricultural extension agent Ed King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say they need to keep their beavers,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that the landowners who now welcome the beavers
``will soon love to hate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuny, president of the National Association of Sanctuaries,
takes a dim view of government efforts to ``manage'' wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are the problem, not the beavers,'' she said. ``God
forbid that wild animals be where they were naturally intended to
be. What could be worse?''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the California beavers died during trapping, seven went
to zoos, and the remaining three will live out the Hollywood dream
as Worldwide Movie Animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We named them Harry, Muffy and Fuzzy,'' said David McMillan,
founder of the company that provides filmmakers with animal
``actors.''
</P>
<P>
   McMillan has resisted pleas from PETA officials to let those
beavers also go to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's funny? In their minds it's a better thing for
them to go out in the wild and get killed by ranchers or coyotes
than to have a good long life working for a motion picture
company,'' he said. ``That's the picture I get of the PETA
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife officials _ who granted
Cuny her importation permit _ are caught in the middle of the
battle over beavers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the population wants to save everything, and the other
half wants to kill everything, so what are you going to do?'' said
Rosie Roegner, a permit coordinator for the agency.

IT'S A `CRIME,' ALL RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new Clint Eastwood thriller ``True Crime'' sizes the
audience up like a pickpocket. Simultaneously crass and slickly
assembled, it may also be the crummiest-looking major film in some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood plays Steve Everett, a talented and self-destructive,
womanizing reporter who has fallen so precipitously that he's
clinging to a job at the Oakland (Calif.) Tribune with what's left
of his fingernails. (If you know the racial makeup of Oakland,
you'll realize that there are probably more white people in this
movie than there are in the entire city.)
</P>
<P>
   After a prime story falls into his lap _ a human-interest piece
on Death Row inmate Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington), who
maintains that he is innocent and refuses to apologize _ Everett is
spurred into action. He opens his eyes, and reporter's nose, long
enough to realize that Beachum has to be telling the truth, and
sets about trying to prove it in the remaining hours before the
execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``True Crime'' has its strong points. Now that Eastwood's voice
is shot, he has learned how to use tricky line readings that he
never could've as a younger man. (All those years of devoting
himself to jazz have helped _ he's become the Red Rodney of
actors.)
</P>
<P>
   The cast, apparently left to its own devices, includes: a
bizarrely under-directed Denis Leary, who looks to be begging for
help; James Woods, who plays the grim comedy in all of his scenes;
and an extraordinarily modulated piece of acting from Diane Venora
as Everett's ex-wife, who bleeds anger and betrayal at the hands of
a man she still wants to love.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who has shown growth as an actor in his past few
roles, is used as a hood ornament for quiet dignity here. Lisa Gay
Hamilton (who does fine, sensible work every week on ``The
Practice'') brings much honor to a part that essentially asks her
to weep at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   And opportunistic is what ``True Crime'' is, mostly. There's
some smart writing that employs cold-hearted humor and attention to
detail of the kind that ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' used when
it was at its best a few years ago. The prison staff preparing for
the execution is an all-business scene and has a grim pride. But
there are moments _ shamelessly wringing tears out of Beachum's
young daughter _ that are cringe-inducing.
</P>
<P>
   The climax, when Everett is trying to drive to an appointment
that could save Beachum's life _ on a road called Dead Man's Curve,
where this broken-down drunk reporter suddenly has the motoring
skills of an Indy driver _ is a serious version of the fake climax
of Robert Altman's ``The Player,'' when Bruce Willis storms the
death chamber to save Julia Roberts. (Each cut to the execution is
ominous, while the chase is played for laughs. The script keeps a
manipulative eye trained on you at all times.)
</P>
<P>
   There probably isn't another movie star as shrewd as Clint
Eastwood in terms of using his image. Sure, he pulls embarrassing
gambits like almost-nude scenes of himself, and this movie is
directed like he had to rush to get it to Fotomat before it closed.
But he plays on our perception of him as the iconic hero, making
himself a beaten-down object of sympathy. Of course, at the end, as
in ``Unforgiven,'' he pulls it together in a way that's totally
uncharacteristic and makes no dramatic sense.
</P>
<P>
   It's also weird to see a man with no interest in listening to
another human being play a reporter, someone who has to get
information out of people. But he basically plays him like a
hard-nosed cop, anyway. He's smart _ ``True Crime'' gets the job
done on its own flat-footed terms; it's the ``Driving Miss Daisy''
of crime stories.

DANCES WITH POINTLESSNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Oscar-nominated Argentine film ``Tango'' might seem too
elegant to evoke a Sex Pistols song, but it does nevertheless:
``Pretty Vacant.'' The film is pretty _ indeed, stunning _ to look
at, but it doesn't have much to say. And it doesn't have much to
say because it tries to say too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tango'' aspires to be an epic, and as with all epics, it has a
simple story at its center: Filmmaker Mario Suarez (Miguel Angel
Sola) is attempting to make the ultimate movie about tango,
although it would appear that he's trying to encapsulate the entire
history of Argentina. Mario meets with a backer who has mob
connections. The backer asks Mario to find a role for his much
younger mistress. She turns out to be talented, and Mario
predictably falls for her, endangering himself and her.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Carlos Saura might be trying to start a new
sub-genre here: dance noir. But he pays little attention to the
love triangle. ``Tango's'' pattern goes something like this: People
talk in tones that you might use to tell someone that their mother
had suddenly died of a heart attack. Dance number. People talk some
more, in dialogue that might sound better to native
Spanish-speakers but looks like a bad soap-opera script in English
subtitles. Another dance number. People talk some more, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The dance numbers get increasingly interesting and elaborate,
albeit pretentious _ one number about Argentine repression looks
like one of the demented high-school plays from ``Rushmore.'' The
talk gets increasingly sleep-inducing, the kind of portent-loaded
conversation that makes many mistrust foreign films in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, however, isn't about words _ it's so much not about
words that you wonder why Saura bothered with them. Saura is a
fascinatingly visual director, and his opening shot is a grabber: a
nearly 360-degree pan of Buenos Aires during a winter sunrise, in
which the camera moves like a warm lover's caress (you regret the
decision to superimpose opening credits over this shot). The next
scene, equally intriguing, shows Mario in a moody apartment going
over his tango film's screenplay, which turns out to include the
real movie's two opening scenes. So ``Tango'' is also about
filmmaking, right down to its terrific slow-crane closing shot.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about filmmaking, in a way: Not only is the
cinematography beautiful, with languid camera movements that
slither through the movie like a curious snake, but the movie has
been meticulously lighted, costumed and art-directed within an inch
of its life. Saura and his crew favor striking, solid colors _ one
male-to-male pas de deux is filmed in color, but everything in the
scene is in black and white _ and even his most pretentious shots
(superimpositions upon superimpositions upon silhouettes) are
hypnotic.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also about dance, and Argentina, and illicit love, and
ultimately about so much that you wonder what the heck it's really
about. Because ``Tango's'' screenplay is its weakest link while the
rest of the film looks extraordinary, it's tempting to call it the
``Titanic'' of dance films. But it's more like ``The Thin Red
Line'' of dance films _ a movie that's beautiful to look at while
it's absolutely unengaging emotionally. If you love dance, or you
just like to look at pretty pictures, you might want to raise the
star rating here by at least a half-notch. Most of us, however,
need more _ and a story would have been a good place to start.

A UNIQUELY CONSUMING HORROR STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by the ads that make ``Ravenous'' look like a
``Hot Shots/Naked Gun''-style comedy about cannibalism. It's not.
This is a new-style horror movie that wears its themes of terror
and redemption on its sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd that director Antonia Bird, who replaced another
director several weeks into shooting, wasn't the original choice,
because her films _ ``Priest'' and the little-seen ``Safe'' (not to
be confused with the Todd Haynes film of the same name) _ are
fixated on similar themes. (Though Bird is said to have seen the
script a few years ago, before it went into production, and was
impressed with it.)
</P>
<P>
   I hate to say this kind of thing, especially since it's only
March, but ``Ravenous'' is the most distinctive picture of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   As befits the movie's uniqueness, it's received a lot of bad
buzz, which may be because people aren't sure what to make of it.
The movie is genuinely disturbing, and its to-the-bone creepiness
isn't the cheap, easy-to-shake-off shocks of the recent spate of
slasher films. As Bird subtly shifts the tone of the picture from
dreamy delirium to panicked narrative to confrontation, you'll find
that ``Ravenous'' is a movie you'll feel days later; it sticks with
you.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Pearce is a cavalry officer who, after a moment of cowardice
in a battle, is sent to a remote, half-forgotten outpost in the
Sierra Nevada. Haunted and ashamed _ he hid from an attack under a
pile of bodies during the Mexican-American war _ Pearce straggles
into a fort peopled with oddballs and freaks. Jeffrey Jones is the
pallid, kindly commander _ he's as pale as cotton candy _ who
attempts to keep some dignity in this purgatory of an outpost.
</P>
<P>
   One more eccentric is added when a fearful, and feral-looking,
survivor (Robert Carlyle) of a westward wagon train scurries into
the outpost. According to him, when the wagoneers were trapped in
the frozen wild, they were forced to turn to cannibalism. And he
escaped, so that he could bring help to any survivors. But it turns
out that Carlyle wasn't the victim of a cannibal threat; he's the
cunning, murderous instigator who trolls for human meat. And Pearce
becomes not only his prey, but a potential acolyte _ Carlyle wants
to make Pearce a part of his tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravenous'' makes underhanded fun of the American westward
expansion, and the soul-destroying compulsion of the mania for
superficial health at the expense of an inner life. (Carlyle is
explained as a Weendigo, a Native American figure of legend who
consumes human flesh and can be stopped only by sacrifice. Which
means that the coward, Pearce, is the only man who can possibly end
the threat.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie toys with themes of addiction and disease, but it is,
in the end, a love story with dollops of bleak humor. It's also a
showcase for the immensely talented, fearless Carlyle, who's shown
more range than any actor working today. From the rude-boy thug in
``Trainspotting'' and the conflicted protagonist of ``Priest'' to
his small-time charming schemer in ``The Full Monty,'' Carlyle has
a presence and a protean quality that you may not have seen in a
British actor since Daniel Day-Lewis (though he lacks standard
matinee-idol looks).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravenous'' is potent, full of ideas and wildly divergent
acting styles. It may not be your type of movie, but it's safe to
say that there's nothing else out there like it.

TALE OF LOST SHOES LACED WITH SUBTLETY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've heard that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a
single step. ``Children of Heaven's'' journey begins with a pair of
lost pink shoes. They belong to Zahra, a poor Iranian first-grader
whose older brother, Ali, loses the shoes while running an errand.
</P>
<P>
   Third-grader Ali (Mir Farrokh Hashemian), the film's
protagonist, and sister Zahra (Bahare Seddiqi) are good kids,
always helpful and seldom disobedient to their struggling father
and injured mother. The lost shoes create a crisis for the
siblings, because they believe they'll be punished for the loss,
especially with their family's dire financial standing. So Ali and
Zahra concoct a cover-up: She'll borrow his sneakers (which are of
course two sizes too big for her) while she attends school in the
morning, then run, run, run through Tehran's streets and alleys to
share them with Ali, who runs, runs, runs back to school to attend
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   This is a simple tale, and these are indeed children of heaven:
Ali and Zahra are two of the most self-sacrificial people you'll
ever run across. ``Children of Heaven,'' a Best Foreign Film
nominee, sometimes feels like an Iranian ``Afterschool Special,''
the type of movie parents might show to unruly children to
demonstrate how ``polite'' kids behave. But it frequently avoids
falling into those kinds of didactic traps, because nobody here
acts quite like you expect them to. The movie lays it on a little
thick when the pink shoes show up on another little girl's feet,
and her family turns out to be even worse off than Ali and Zahra's.
It overcomes these missteps, though, with a considerable amount of
charm.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Majid Majidi, a veteran of the Iranian kid-movie
scene, sought out amateurs for his cast and made quite a discovery
in Hashemian, who hardly needs to have acting talent because he's
blessed with the largest, saddest eyes this side of a velvet
painting. His face adds to Ali's against-the-world pluck _ the only
bad people in the film are adult authority figures, and even
they're comparatively benevolent _ and almost fear-based
resourcefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Majidi varies his uses of Tehran locations, from poor to
affluent neighborhoods, and he and set designer Ashghar Nezhad
Imani give the interiors a colorful, rumpled-and-crowded look that
comes from the sort of art direction that doesn't look like art
direction. Iranian films celebrate the color that so many American
films take for granted, and Majidi saturates the movie with
everything in the spectrum. His shots of the various styles of
children's shoes here, indicative of the importance of the kids'
individuality, are especially entrancing.
</P>
<P>
   The movie climaxes with Ali in a lengthy footrace, with the kind
of goal you likely wouldn't see in an American film _ and with the
kind of wordless visuals, heightened sound and exquisite
slow-motion we've rarely seen since 1979's ``The Black Stallion.''
The movie's poetic closing shot is the kind of ending that most
filmmakers would want to make more explicit, and Majidi's subtle
touch is what elevates the movie above the sort of sentimental,
heavy-handed morality tale that it could have been.

QUIRKY `FORCES' LACKS STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Forces of Nature'' may be the most insistently quirky romantic
comedy to come along in some time. Sarah (Sandra Bullock) is the
force of nature who overwhelms Ben (played by, uh, Ben Affleck), a
staid groom-to-be on his way to his wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The real force of nature operating in this movie is fear. At his
bachelor party, Ben is suddenly struck by a feeling that he hasn't
done much with his life. It's a feeling instigated by a grandfather
who talks about not having been with enough women, and a feeling
encouraged by his pleasure-seeking-missile of a best friend (Steve
Zahn) _ a conceit more than a role, but a standard in these kinds
of stories.
</P>
<P>
   The plane Ben boards for his wedding to Bridget (Maura Tierney),
the bride-to-be who seems as conflicted as he is, has a mishap
during takeoff. Before he knows it, he's on the road with an
irrepressible free spirit (Bullock) _ the kind who in real life
would be irritating, but she wins him over because ... well, she's
the star of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   As they careen from misadventure to misadventure, pelted by
almost every kind of precipitation that Mother Nature has to offer,
Ben is more and more convinced that Bridget isn't the one for him _
and that, maybe, his new travel mate is. Flashing as many teeth as
a great white whale, Bullock is constantly sizing Affleck up.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tierney is plagued by her twittery Southern-belle
mother (Blythe Danner) and a moony ex-boyfriend who croons
``Against All Odds'' to her. It's rare that a movie huffs and puffs
as hard to create memorable sequences as does ``Forces.'' It's as
if someone decided to take a bunch of high points that would make a
great trailer and cram them into one picture. A bizarre combination
of antic and melancholy, this picture's begging to be considered a
classic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ``Forces'' being a road comedy, it's more like one of
those the-road-as-test comedies about spiritual crisis that include
``National Lampoon's Vacation'' and, more specifically, ``Trains,
Planes &AMP; Automobiles.'' ``Forces'' plays like a party remix with
hefty samples of ``Planes, Trains'' and ``The Philadelphia Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, with his broad-beamed, placid good looks, Affleck
behaves as if it would take a force of nature to rouse him from his
cooled-out state. Emotionally, he's more of an immovable object.
He's incapable of appearing as troubled as this role calls for.
</P>
<P>
   A chic soundtrack keeps things chugging, featuring a remix of
U2's ``Everlasting Love'' cover and a way-too-festive remix of
Pigeonhed's ``Battle Royal.'' (It's a sad state of affairs when a
soundtrack to a movie as middle-of-the-road as this one is hipper
than the playlist of almost any radio station in the United
States.)
</P>
<P>
   After directing ``Ever After,'' Bronwen Hughes seems eager to
create a new kind of mythology, using a busy yet dreamy directing
style. Spirals of rain pelt the stars from overhead angles as they
run to keep ahead of the emotional cloudburst dogging them.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie doesn't make much sense, emotionally. It borders
on the cruel for Affleck to consider having an affair, since
Tierney's such a sweetie. And Bullock's restless, bulldozing style
is someone's idea of a '90s screwball comedy heroine, I guess,
especially after she turns out to be as flawed as anyone else in
the picture _ more so, even. If only someone had tried to shoehorn
some emotional logic into the film along with the big comedy
moments.

SEE-WORTHY NEW ENGLAND: SCENERY, HISTORY SET THE COURSE FOR SAILING
SOJOURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN BAUMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an adventure I had longed for, a solo trip to explore a
part of the country I had never seen. I chose New England for
several reasons: to do research for a book on sailors, to sail as
much as possible, and to see whether New England was as scenic and
charming as I had always imagined it to be. I was not disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   I traveled up the New England coast, surrounding myself with
picturesque seascapes, landscapes and sailing sights.
</P>
<P>
   Though New Englanders have a reputation for stoicism, I found
them to be friendly and generous, which made traveling alone a
pleasant experience.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I asked the dock master at the Newport Yacht Club
when the club held its races; then I made a habit of showing up
about an hour early to see if anyone needed a crew member. Many
captains will take you along, whether they need more hands or not.
I crewed on a boat called Air Force during the National Offshore
One Design, a three-day series of races.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Joan, a spunky 64-year-old I met at the Star
Lunch diner where I ate breakfast several times and who generously
put me up at her home in Newport for six weeks while I interviewed
sailors and crewed on racing boats.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't have a set itinerary for my trip but rather played it
by ear, traveling the coast, photographing endless harbors and
nestled coves, stopping whenever I was enchanted by the sights.
</P>
<P>
   The first place I dropped anchor was Mystic, Conn., where I
headed straight for Mystic Seaport, The Museum of America and the
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Mystic Seaport is like stepping back in time. You
stroll through a 19th-century village of working seafarers' shops,
where a ship's smith forges nails, hoops and harpoons; a cooper
works at barrel making; and carpenters craft a small boat. You can
walk the wooden deck of a whaling ship, the Charles W. Morgan, and
see the crews' quarters, the blubber room and the galley. Built in
1841, the Morgan is the last surviving wooden vessel from America's
19th-century whaling fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Mystic, you can watch shipbuilders construct a replica
of the freedom schooner Amistad, which is expected to be completed
in 2000. The revolt of slaves aboard the Amistad and their
subsequent trial was the subject of a 1997 Steven Spielberg drama.
</P>
<P>
   I spent the most time in Newport, R.I., ``The Yachting Capital
of the World.'' Besides crewing on racing sloops, I visited Fort
Adams, one of the largest seacoast fortifications; took the ferry
to Block Island; toured Hammersmith Farm, the childhood summer home
of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; and strolled The Cliff Walk, a 3
1/2-mile path with mansions on one side and a cliff falling to the
Atlantic Ocean on the other, described by some as the best walk in
America. Some of the mansions along the Cliff Walk are open for
touring, including The Breakers, built for Cornelius Vanderbilt in
1895, and Astors' Beechwood Mansion, the home of John Jacob Astor
IV.
</P>
<P>
   As you wander up the coast of Maine, the sandy shoreline turns
rocky. (I checked out former President Bush's home in
Kennebunkport.) When you get near Camden on Highway 1 in Maine,
every other car seems to have a kayak or canoe on the roof. Camden
Hills State Park has a variety of trails for hikers, each with a
rewarding view at the end. An evening stroll around the docks at
Camden Harbor, and the quaint surrounding shops, is a great way to
enjoy the cool summer night before heading back to the campground.
</P>
<P>
   From Camden, I drove to Bar Harbor on Mount Desert Island, where
I pitched my tent at the Blackwoods Campgrounds in Acadia National
Park and joined up with some friends, Bettina and Frank from
Germany (we had met in Camden and agreed to share a campsite in
Blackwoods for three days). The three of us signed up for a
four-hour kayak tour around the Porcupine Islands. We also drove to
the summit of Cadillac Mountain, elevation 1,530 feet, for a
spectacular view of the Atlantic Ocean and the surrounding islands.
At the Island Chowder House, in Bar Harbor, I finally had a bowl of
creamy New England clam chowder. Delicious! (No, I never had
lobster; I was on a tight budget.)
</P>
<P>
   For me, the magic of New England will always be the lure of the
seacoast and the maritime activities. Add in the picturesque towns,
the colonial history and the many friends I made, and the draw to
return is irresistible.

much of that demand was met with imports. The trade deficit grew to
$16.99 billion in January from $14.06 billion in December. The

   GUCCI-LVMH (Rome) _ Gucci's earnings rose 11 percent in the

in Gucci, had an indicated profit decline of 48 percent in the
second half, but its shares gain 6 percent in Paris because the

by at least 15 percent this year. Not surprisingly, Gucci says that

HOLLYWOOD TAKING UP THE CAUSE OF AFGHAN WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The weather has not been cooperating with Mavis
Leno's cause.
</P>
<P>
   First a snowstorm kept her from testifying before a
congressional subcommittee in Washington. Then a rainstorm made her
late to a related appointment in her hometown of Los Angeles. But
no force of nature has been able to stop her from working the
phones and her circle of celebrity friends.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Feminist Majority Foundation's campaign to give
women in war-torn Afghanistan the right to work, the right to
attend school, and literally the right to walk outside without fear
of stoning, Leno is asking Hollywood to focus on a real-life drama
with no pat ending. For months now, she has been talking up anyone
who is anyone about human rights abuses under the Taliban regime,
hoping that attention here will bring relief there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told every celebrity I've talked to that their wattage is
going to add that much more light to the issue, that much more
pressure . . .,'' Leno said. ``I want us to say to the world:
They're going to have to find someone else to pick on.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno, relatively new to political activism, conceded that many
Hollywood types had not heard of the Taliban before she called. Now
she's got A-list involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The movement to restore human rights to women in Afghanistan has
swept Hollywood, not quite replacing a free Tibet or AIDS research,
but becoming the cause of the moment among the celebrity crowd.
Leno and her husband, ``Tonight Show'' host Jay Leno, have used
their names, their connections, and $100,000 of their own money to
make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   The confirmed guest list for a dinner buffet she is co-hosting
for the Feminist Majority Foundation on March 29 runs from singer
Paula Abdul to actress Renee Zellweger, with dozens more such as
Melanie Griffith, Wynona Judd, and Heather Locklear in between. The
entertainment will include celebrity readings of letters from
Afghan women, thanking Hollywood women for their involvement. In
turn, Leno called the actresses' need to assist Afghan women
``primal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them have expressed a deep level of commitment; others
were already involved in our organization,'' said Leno, a writer
who grew up in California and joined the Feminist Majority board
just months after the Islamist movement seized the Afghan capital
of Kabul in the fall of 1996. ``But who can predict what people
will do? If you had told me I would be deeply involved in foreign
affairs issues in the Mideast 10 years ago, I'd have laughed. But
when you hear the specifics of the cases, you don't have an
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno understands that Hollywood alone can bring only so much
heat to the issue. She needs more widespread support to keep the
Clinton administration from recognizing the Taliban as a legitimate
government. So she recently outlined the situation in a letter to
Dear Abby. The response from readers was so great that it jammed
the lines at the telemarketing firm the Feminist Majority had
hired.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ``take action'' kits have been mailed, with half of
the requested $2 donation going to help Afghan women in refugee
camps and half going toward the campaign to raise awareness of
their plight. For the money, contributors receive names of US and
UN officials to contact and a swatch of mesh, the small opening
through which Afghan women, forced to wear head-to-toe garments
called burqas outdoors, must see and breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here in the entertainment capital of the world, for
heaven's sake, and we decided to mobilize the most famous women in
the world to speak out against gender apartheid in Afghanistan,''
said Kathy Spillar, national coordinator of the Feminist Majority
in Los Angeles. ``We're coming together to say you can't treat
women like this anywhere in the world and get away with it. . . .
We're drawing the line in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports coming out of Afghanistan and the refugee camps in
bordering Pakistan depict a female population imprisoned in its own
homes. Women can no longer go outside unless accompanied by a male
relative. Others have allegedly been raped by Taliban soldiers, or
forced into a sort of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Once university professors and government employees, women were
ousted overnight from the workplace. Girls were sent home from
school, and their education was outlawed. Women were ordered to
give up their medical practices at the same time women were
forbidden from being examined by male doctors. The result,
advocates say, is that 70 percent of Afghanistan's population _ a
high percentage due to the tens of thousands of men killed during
the civil war _ is without health care, opportunity, or even food
in households headed by war widows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of women who are starving to death,'' said
Zieba Shorish-Shamley, who has visited the refugee camps as
president of the Washington-based Women's Alliance for Peace and
Human Rights in Afghanistan. ``Some are committing suicide,
drinking caustic soda, a household substance, that takes them three
days to die. Others jump out of buildings to escape seeing their
own children dying of starvation in front of their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are wiping out a 5,000-year-old culture,'' she added.
``What the Taliban is doing is they are making genocide in many
forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Shorish-Shamley said she is grateful for Leno's help, for
Hollywood's help, for anyone's help in restoring women's rights in
Afghanistan. With more than 130 women's and human rights groups now
involved worldwide _ and a US secretary of state and first lady who
have condemned the violations against women in Afghanistan _
Shorish-Shamley described herself as skeptically hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening to women in Afghanistan is despicable,''
said Alyse Nelson, a spokeswoman for the President's Interagency
Council on Women. ``It's not just rhetoric. We're following up with
programs and policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno and other activists take some of the credit for the
attention being paid in State Department cubicles and corporate
boardrooms. Petitions have been sent to Washington. Demonstrations
have been held coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   When Southern California-based Unocal Corp. was leading a
consortium that planned an $8 billion energy pipeline that would
traverse Afghanistan, Leno spoke against it at the annual
stockholders meeting. The company, also under pressure from low
world oil prices and concern about the Taliban's sheltering of
terror suspect Osama bin Laden, withdrew from the pipeline in
December.
</P>
<P>
   This week, under a deal brokered by the United Nations, warring
factions in Afghanistan agreed to the creation of a coalition
government that would include all of the political forces. Previous
agreements have fallen apart. Shorish-Shamley said she is also
concerned that women will be kept from any peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country can't get back on its feet with these women living
inside their houses,'' said Leno. ``They will have to soften their
stance or the country won't survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is plain,'' she added. ``I don't care if the
Taliban stays in power, or if some faction I haven't heard of comes
into power. All I want is for the human rights of these women to be
restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Leno excused herself. She had more calls to make, more
politicians to lobby, more celebrities to contact for support.

   OLY-IOC-REFORMS _ LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Trying to put its
worst scandal behind it and make sure is doesn't happen again, the
IOC today adopted the first planks in a reform platform aimed at
soothing powerful critics and assuring it's up to date for the next
millennium. It agreed to choose the site of the 2006 Winter
Olympics from two finalists, leaving its rank-and-file with one of
the few actions it takes but putting strict limits on their contact
with bidders. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

Children's Health Insurance Program. It's sure to be seen as a test

ESCAPED SLAVE'S STORY STUNS TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the audience: The students of Dover-Sherborn Regional High
School, some of the richest, most privileged public school students
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   On the podium: Moctar Teyeb, 39, runaway slave.
</P>
<P>
   The young people gaped at glimpses of a world they never
imagined could still exist. The visitor broke down and sobbed when
he was made an honorary Dover-Sherborn scholar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black families are ripped apart when masters give their
relatives slaves as gifts,'' Teyeb told an audience as utterly free
as any on earth. ``In your history classes, you have learned how
this was done to black slave families in America, but to me, it is
not history. It is happening today in my country, to my people, to
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Teyeb, a native of the West African nation of Mauritania, has
been likened to Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery in the
South to become a leading abolitionist.
</P>
<P>
   Teyeb escaped Mauritania when he was 19 and his master moved
from a remote rural area to the capital. Passing through a
then-nascent network of slavery opponents, he found his way to
schools and colleges in Morocco and Libya. He moved to New York 3
1/2 years ago, and may soon move to Boston to work more closely
with Charles Jacobs, president of the American Anti-Slavery Group
in Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Teyeb and Jacobs stunned students with the revelation that
slavery still exists in the world, in varying forms, and then
challenged them to join a new world-wide abolitionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   While human bondage has receded to historical memory in much of
the world, the anti-slavery group estimates there are about a
million carpet-making slaves, mostly children, in the subcontinent,
hundreds of thousands of sex slaves in southeast Asia, and a
million blacks serving Arabs in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Though a US-based movement against these practices has existed
since the early 1990s, interest has soared with the national
publicity given the issue last year when a Denver fifth grade class
raised $22,000 to buy freedom for slaves in the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs currently is embroiled in controversy with the United
Nations Children's Fund, which opposes buying freedom for slaves on
grounds that it constitutes participation in the slavery system and
spurs demand for more slaves to be captured.
</P>
<P>
   Teyeb thanked the Dover-Sherborn students for their concern, but
then challenged them to consider ``why have my people been
abandoned? There are so many international organizations and
government agencies. They fight famine, natural disasters, child
abuse, domestic violence, political detentions and more. Why have
all these organizations been silent'' on slavery?
</P>
<P>
   He told the students that, now that they were aware of the
reality of slavery, they had to grapple with what it means to be so
free as they are when so many people know no freedom at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today my family, my people, and I are all still waiting for
the right to become human beings,'' he said. ``And we are looking
to you. . .to use your education and freedom to help set us free.''
</P>
<P>
   For the students, their encounter with Teyeb was a most unusual
``seminar day,'' which the high school sets aside more or less
annually for discussion of regions and issues remote from the daily
life of the school. Students selected the topics and arranged for
the speakers themselves. A talk on child slavery in the Indian
subcontinent and a workshop on how wealth and privilege affect
community development also were on Wednesday's program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to have them understand issues of diversity and
intolerance both here and globally,'' said Donna Nuzzo-Mueller, the
principal. ``It is especially important for students who have such
a wonderful education and who will be successful to know what it is
that the world really needs.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, most of the teens said they were
chastened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know there was still slavery around. It's unheard
of,'' said Jonathan Boyd, 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew about child labor, but this, . . .'' added Corey
Johnson, 17. ``I didn't know.''

 &HT;    NEW PROGRAM TO HELP FIRMS FIND DISABLED COLLEGE GRADUATES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New help for private employers in recruiting
college-educated applicants with disabilities was announced
Thursday by the President's Committee on Employment of the
Handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program helps us get on with the business of making a
living and serving others by so doing,'' said Ellen Rogers, one of
the 299 persons who received paid internships or jobs last year
under a similar program for federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of three said her poor vision led to being turned
down for 12 different jobs in schools in and around Tampa, Fla.,
despite her master's degree in English. But the Workforce
Recruitment Program helped her get a summer internship in a Public
Health Service office in Rockville, Md., where she then was hired
for a permanent job.
</P>
<P>
   To expand the program to private jobs, the committee's
recruiters interviewed 1,200 seniors and recent graduates on 148
college and university campuses during this school year. Then they
prepared a CD-ROM that contains a brief resume and the
interviewer's evaluation of the credentials, abilities and
attitudes of each of the 1,026 job-seekers from 143 campuses in 34
states who were judged qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Most are seeking jobs or internships in administration,
engineering, computer work or science. But the CD-ROM, which can
searched by state or job category, includes applicants for just
about every kind of white-collar job.
</P>
<P>
   Employers can obtain the free CD-ROM by faxing a request on
company letterhead to the attention of ``WRP Manager'' at (202)
376-6878. Or they can call toll-free at 800-526-7234 to have a
specialist use the CD-ROM to prepare them a list of job-seekers who
appear to meet specific job qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters from big companies said the new program will be
useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this tight job market, we're trying in every way, shape or
form to locate qualified people,'' said Joel Kahn, an engineer at
Procter &AMP; Gamble headquarters in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a business basis, as well as a moral one,'' said
Phyllis Jackson of Bank of America. ``Our customer base, our
associate population (employees) and the labor force include people
with disabilities. If we're going to be an effective employer and
competitor, we have to tap into that market.''

DEVICE PROVIDES COMPUTER SKILLS AT THE BLINK OF AN EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Finally, it's mind over computer.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrate, and a cursor on a computer screen drifts toward a
file you want to open. Clench your jaw, and a program starts up.
</P>
<P>
   Focus hard enough, and the screen comes alive in an electronic
light show concerto, the various notes and corresponding colors
controlled by your thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like science fiction, but Cyberlink, as it's called,
is here, and it was wowing crowds at the South By Southwest
Interactive Conference, part of a technology, music and film
festival in Austin that closes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost scary, watching the computer do things you're
thinking about,'' said David Martin, an electronic musician from
New York who stepped away from the demo booth, sweating. ``Very
science fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyberlink was pioneered by Andrew Junker, a researcher at the
Wright Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. Junker was part
of a program to create links between a pilot and the instruments of
an aircraft, the better to deal with information overload while
hunting down enemy jets and dodging surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cyberlink, hands-free computer control involved
coordinating a command to an eye, head or facial movement.
</P>
<P>
   Junker, while retired and living in the Caribbean, said he
invented a way of harnessing a range of brain waves, muscle
contractions and eye movements. These impulses are captured by
three silver chloride-coated plastic tablets held to the head with
a Velcro strap.
</P>
<P>
   The strap is connected to a small box of electronics _ including
a microprocessor and amplifiers _ that boost and filter brain
waves, muscle and eye impulses into a recognizable signal fed into
a Windows-based computer through its serial port.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle was over how to convert all this information into
something usable,'' said Chris Tate, 37, a biomedical engineer and
director of research at Brain Actuated Technologies Inc., the
Yellow Springs, Ohio-based company Junker formed to find practical
uses for his invention.
</P>
<P>
   The device doesn't actually read thoughts. It associates certain
facial muscle movements and/or brain waves with a certain computer
function. Users can repeat the function by repeating the movement
or brain wave.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when a user thinks, ``move cursor up,'' he
generates a unique combination of eye, muscle and brain waves for
that thought. The software is trained to move the cursor up when
the signal for that combination of reflexes is sent to the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell you what I do to make the computer do certain
things,'' Tate said. ``If you consciously try to make it happen,
you exaggerate and throw everything off. You just have to accept
that you do generate this signal and tell the computer to take a
certain action based on the signal. It's very, very Zen.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tate, the software can be trained to perform any
number of tasks, depending on a user's ability to generate a
specific signal for that task. He added that an interface to type
is being developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyberlink technology also drives Brain Actuated
Technologies' new Brain-Actuated Music software, which translates
the headband signal into musical notes. Again, certain brain waves
and corresponding muscle and eye movements trigger a synthesized
chorus of high notes or deep bass. Tate already is compiling a
catalog of original works, starting with the ``Cortex Concerto.''
</P>
<P>
   Tate said the company is searching for investors, but it has yet
to find what he called the right deal.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 Cyberlinks are being field-tested as a computing
aid for disabled people who cannot use their hands to manipulate a
mouse and keyboard, Tate said.
</P>
<P>
   The device costs $1,900.

AIDS TEST LACKS VOLUNTEERS

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Only 1,500 people have signed up to test an AIDS
vaccine that is close to receiving federal approval, far fewer than
the 5,000 the manufacturer hopes to enroll by summer.
</P>
<P>
   AIDSVax, manufactured by VaxGen Inc. of South San Francisco,
Calif., is one of about 40 vaccines being studied worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge has been getting people to understand
we're not injecting them with the AIDS virus,'' said Nicole Lynch,
a spokeswoman for VaxGen.
</P>
<P>
   To combat that fear, some of the 53 testing sites in the country
have been taking unusual steps to boost enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, one outreach worker dressed in drag before
hitting the town with information about the new drug. Las Vegas
recruiters passed out flyers and condoms at a gay rodeo. In Kansas
City, Mo., an outreach worker is a regular visitor to a gay men's
chat room to find enrollees on line.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only the testing center in Denver has succeeded in
meeting its participation quota with 190 enrollees, 40 more than
its goal. ``I think people have to start getting more creative,''
Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other vaccinations, AIDSVax does not contain live
virus. Rather, it's made from genetically-engineered proteins that
make up the outer shell of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. In
theory, the body will think the proteins are the virus, prompting
the production of antibodies that would prevent future infection.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last three years. Two-thirds of the
participants will receive the vaccine, while one-third will receive
a placebo, a neutral substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Meier, clinical director at the Kansas City AIDS research
Consortium, said one challenge is keeping people in the study once
they enroll. Since November, Kansas City has recruited 70 of the
150 people they hope to enroll. Outreach workers visit local gay
bars nightly, handing out condoms and answering questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management of the information that's out in the public is
the number one thing you've got to worry about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus
weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.

SAN FRANCISCO LOSES 2003 SUPER BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The National Football League dropped San Francisco as
the site of the 2003 Super Bowl because of delays over a new
stadium for the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   League owners took the action Wednesday, the final day of the
NFL's annual gathering. But they reaffirmed their commitment to
play a Super Bowl in San Francisco when it has a suitable stadium.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue declined to commit himself on
the earliest possible date the game would be played in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He said the league would work with Denise DeBartolo York and her
husband, John York, who control of the 49ers, to establish ``an
aggressive timetable'' for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the entire organization, beginning with Denise York
herself as the new chairman of the board of the 49ers, is committed
to that project,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   The league's decision to yank San Francisco's invitation, which
dated from 1994, was long expected. It arose from uncertainty over
club plans to build a new $525 million stadium and commercial
center, which was approved by city voters in 1997 but has been
stalled by management problems and cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   In all probability the decision also was influenced by the NFL's
problems with Edward DeBartolo Jr., the embattled co-owner of the
San Francisco team.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo was suspended for the 1999-2000 season and fined $1
million Tuesday for conduct deemed detrimental to the NFL. The
move, also long anticipated, came in the wake of DeBartolo's guilty
plea to a federal felony in October in connection with a Louisiana
gambling-and-bribery case.
</P>
<P>
   When DeBartolo's role in the federal investigation was made
public in December 1997, he relinquished all management posts in
the club and the family corporation that owns it, the Edward J.
DeBartolo Corp. of Youngstown, Ohio. Denise York, DeBartolo's
sister and partner in the corporation, assumed complete control,
and recently delegated operating authority over the club to her
husband, John.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium is to be partly financed through a $100 million city
bond issue approved two years ago. But a design plan for the new
park doesn't exist. The Yorks say it is their intention to build a
new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's decision permits San Francisco to withdraw from a
commitment it couldn't keep, but spares the city any embarrassment
or financial harm because it virtually guarantees a game in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Cities covet the Super Bowls because the games generate as much
as $300 million in business for hotels, restaurants and merchants,
plus priceless exposure.

surrounded by a series of distinct communities: industrial,
ethnically mixed Tampa, white-bread St. Petersburg and its retirees
from the Midwest, laid-back Bradenton and Clearwater and, down the

the winter. Now, in fact if not law, it's one big metropolitan
area, laced together with bridges and freeways. On the road maps,

STYLISH FAKES THAT ATTRACRT CONNOISSEURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MITCHELL OWENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What is more valuable in the long run, style or
authenticity? That question is increasingly redefining the rules of
connoisseurship, especially in an era when a small folding table
worth around $100 can bring more than $12,000 simply because
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis owned it.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more 20th-century tastemakers die and their goods
and chattel come on the auction block, it has become apparent that
reproductions are valuable because faking it _ commissioning and
living with reproductions _ can be a crucial part of a celebrity's
personal style.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings and most forms of art are exempt from this theory; to
art collectors of every stripe, a copy is a forgery, with little
redeeming value, whatever its provenance, materials or accuracy.
But in the furniture world, it seems anything goes if the quality
is high, the object useful and the owner lived with enviable flair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not one of those decorators who insist on originals,''
wrote the late, great Elsie de Wolfe (1865-1950), whose career is
being celebrated in a monthlong exhibition at the Municipal Art
Society, in Manhattan. ``I believe good reproductions are more
valuable than feeble originals, unless you are buying your
furniture on speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Curated by Jane Stubbs, the show features dozens of
black-and-white photographs of, and evocative vignette
installations recalling, the designer's epoch-making interiors,
ranging from the Manhattan penthouse of the publishing magnate
Conde Nast to the Villa Trianon, de Wolfe's home near Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few of the images include the designer's favorite
item to reproduce: a graceful Louis XV sofa that she first spotted
in the Petit Trianon in France and that, she admitted in ``The
House in Good Taste'' (1913), ``I have copied many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Stylish fakes of a slightly later era and a more prosaic quality
are included in Thursday's sale of the estate of Maureen,
Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava, at Christie's in London. A famous
1930s beauty, and once the mother-in-law of the painter Lucien
Freud and the poet Robert Lowell, Lady Dufferin, who died last year
at 91, lived in stage-set splendor in London, Kent and Sardinia, in
houses masterminded by the now obscure English decorator Felix
Harbord (1906-81).
</P>
<P>
   His pasteboard drama appealed to the generation whose exploits
dominated society columns between the wars. An enemy of genteel
English decoration, Harbord called for decors of ``a certain gaiety
which will be more welcome'' than ``the drabness in which many are
forced to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the designer invented deliriously pastel interiors for
Lady Dufferin's elder sister, Aileen Plunket, perhaps the most
famous of his installations was the multicolumned drawing room at
Reddish House, which was completed in the 1950s for the
photographer Cecil Beaton. Its burgundy-velvet walls and
gilt-trimmed white furniture were a luxurious high-camp evocation
of Second Empire chic.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Dufferin, as theatrical as Beaton but less demanding when
it came to creating stylish surroundings, apparently was content to
use the popular Harbord as a source for good-looking but largely
pedestrian ready-mades.
</P>
<P>
   A few examples stand out, like Lot 351, a white Regency-style
card table highlighted in a frosty shade of pale lingerie blue,
with four matching chairs; formerly in Lady Dufferin's cottage in
Kent, it is estimated to sell for $1,200 to $1,600. But only three
of the chairs date from the early 1800s; to complete the set, the
fourth was made in 1957, as was the table, and, the catalog says,
Harbord apparently made more copies of the chairs for a South
American client.
</P>
<P>
   Better copies of grander historical mien will come onto the
market when the contents of Chateau de Groussay, an early
19th-century country house in the Paris suburb of
Montfort-L'Amaury, go on sale from June 2 through June 6.
</P>
<P>
   The French division of Sotheby's was originally scheduled to
sell the items at its premises opposite the Elysee Palace, but the
domestic monopoly on auctioneering forced the company, an American
firm, to hold the auction at the chateau.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The sale, of more than 2,000 objects, will be conducted by the
auctioneers Poulain Le Fur, with Sotheby's assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Extensively remodeled and decorated by its owner, Charles de
Beistegui _ a Spanish-born, English-bred silver-mining heir whose
lavish entertainments enlivened international society in the 1930s
and 1940s _ Groussay's glamorous, neo-historical interiors have
been considered a high water mark of 20th-century high style. And
this is fully in spite of its trickery, what one British journalist
called ``high-class Walt Disneyfication.''
</P>
<P>
   A fantasy par excellence, Groussay is ultimately about the
triumph of inspired artifice, a temple of confection. The house,
circa 1815, is chockablock with real treasures _ including an
outstanding collection of Old Master drawings assembled by
Beistegui's nephew Juan, who inherited the 120-acre estate, its
garden follies and furnishings after his uncle's death in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the contents, from its celebrated so-called Goya
tapestries to numerous pieces of furniture, are exquisitely
rendered imitations. Still, the sale is expected to bring more than
$32 million, not including the house, which was built for the
Duchess de Charost and is priced at $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Laure de Beauvau Craon, Sotheby's president in France,
says one of the sale's star fakes is a large ormolu-encrusted
mahogany bureau set with Wedgwood medallions.
</P>
<P>
   Obsessed with symmetrical furniture arrangements, Beistegui
commissioned it in 1940 to match exactly a Louis XVI original that
he had bought for Groussay's two-story library (whose majestic
corkscrew staircases inspired the set of Henry Higgins' library in
the movie ``My Fair Lady''). Sold together as Lot 328, the bureaus
are expected to bring between $33,520 and $50,280.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beistegui was an esthete, and like any esthete he wanted to
create an atmosphere of beauty without following a set of rules,''
said the princess, who added that the imitation bureau was made by
Lucien Toulouse, a cabinetmaker known for superb bronze work. ``The
bureau is a creation of the 20th century,'' she said, ``but in the
spirit of an earlier time for a house that has become a landmark of
neoclassical decoration.''
</P>
<P>
   So are numerous other Beisteguian baubles, like a towering
painted plaster blackamoor, circa 1925, that imitates an
18th-century Baroque original and a dining table centerpiece, circa
1930, made in the style of 18th-century Nymphenburg porcelain.
</P>
<P>
   The blackamoor is expected to sell for $840 to $1,340, and the
centerpiece for $6,700 to $10,055. Incongruously, both were among
the furnishings of Beistegui's youthful apartment, a hard-edged
modernist penthouse in Paris designed for him by Le Corbusier.
</P>
<P>
   The look of the centerpiece, like the Eisenhower-era table and
chairs in Lady Dufferin's sale, perfectly represents the period it
presumes. And that presumption, de Wolfe wrote, is the whole point
of great decoration: ``The effect is the thing you are after, isn't
it?''

CHILDREN'S COMING OF AGE RUINS PARENTS' OMNISCIENCE

<P>
   Puberty is an odd word, isn't it? I mean, it looks funny and it
sounds funny. It doesn't even rhyme with anything. Like, ``I
started puberty at the Statue of Luberty?'' Nope, doesn't work.
It's a strange word for a strange time of life.
</P>
<P>
   Hormones raging, hairs sprouting everywhere, voice changing, and
the B.O.! Whoa, mama! I recently made the mistake of sniffing the
underarm area of my son's basketball jersey because I wasn't sure
whether it was clean. The next thing I remember was waking up on
the floor with little tweeting birds circling my head singing
``Rainy Night In Georgia.'' It took three days to pry my upper lip
away from my nose.
</P>
<P>
   But that's OK. I expected these things. I remember these sights
and sounds from my own travels along Growing Up Boulevard. What's
driving me crazy is all of the questions. Before puberty came, I
was Mom the Magnificent. Now I'm the hypocritical idiot who can't
remember anything. Oh, he doesn't use those words, of course, but
that's what he's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   I can tell from his tone of voice and his facial expression when
he says, ``Mom, why do grown-ups tell us not to do things and then
they do them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what, son?'' I respond, assuming he's talking about that
pop can I forgot to recycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you tell us not to drink and then you had a glass of
champagne at that wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, I never told you not to drink. That was your father. I
told you not to hit yourself in the head with a sledge hammer. You
have never seen me do that, now have you?''
</P>
<P>
   Geez, Louise. These kids see everything. I'm trying to set a
good example for them. I've given up almost everything but
chocolate and coffee. I've got to have something to look forward
to, don't I?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, occasionally I do forget where I left my keys or my purse.
Sure, I forgot how to get to the soccer field one morning. All
right, I also forgot how to get home one day, but I was really,
really tired. Does that truly warrant the comment, ``Mom, what will
you do when I'm gone? You'll never find your car again.''
</P>
<P>
   To which I reply, ``I'll do all of my shopping at small
convenience stores. We won't need as much food then anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles smugly and hums to himself in response. He's thinking,
``She's loony. I'll be running this place in a few years. I'll just
keep her around until she can't help me with my homework anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but I know something he doesn't know. Fortunately, I've
already been where he's going. As I went from being a pubescent to
a teen-ager to a young adult, I got smarter and smarter.
Eventually, I got so smart that I realized how very much I didn't
know _ like, if you are not sure about the cleanliness of a
pubescent boy's T-shirt, don't sniff it; just go ahead and wash it.

HAVE YOUR CAKE AND READ ITS HISTORY, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is the history of wedding cakes?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.B., Issaquah, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   A: Wedding cakes began in ancient Greece as hard biscuits that
were crumbled atop the bride's head by guests.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to ensure fertility, Arlene Stewart writes in
``A Bride's Book of Wedding Traditions.'' Romans expanded the
tradition by eating these crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart writes that during the 17th century, a French chef used
icing to hold a stack of these biscuits together, creating the
tradition of the tiered wedding cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Victorians introduced the white three-tiered cake balanced
on columns that is still the most common style seen today,'' writes
another Stewart, Martha, in Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   One tradition that appears less frequently is a groom's cake,
served at the reception or handed out in slices to departing
guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a legend that if a single woman goes to sleep with a
slice of groom's cake beneath her pillow, she will dream of her
future husband,'' Martha Stewart writes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I contact Louis Gossett Jr.?
</P>
<P>
   _ E.R., Hurst, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to him in care of Logo Entertainments, 1888 Century
Park E., No. 1900, Los Angeles, CA 90067.
</P>
<P>
   Gossett is writing and directing segments for ``Love Songs,'' a
Showtime cable project that premieres April 25.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old actor, who has appeared in several Showtime
films recently, was master of ceremonies at an October 1998 event
honoring departing Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All during his low period is when I loved him the most,''
Gossett told the Miami Herald of Barry, who served a six-month
sentence on drug charges in the early '90s but managed a political
comeback and was re-elected mayor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find San Marcos brand lime chili chips?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.W., Grapevine, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: San Marcos tortilla chips, originally produced by C&AMP;C Bakery
of Kingsville, Texas, are now distributed by Bimbo Bakeries U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Bimbo, which also owns Mrs Baird's, sells ``megathin'' San
Marcos tortilla chips in the Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Rio
Grande areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lime and chili San Marcos chip,'' said Lucile
Crouch, the company's consumer relations coordinator.

`THE KING AND I': IF RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN HAD WRITTEN FOR LOONEY
TUNES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the middle of a storm at sea, Anna, her son and several
sailors sing and march around to ``I Whistle a Happy Tune.'' This
completely freaks out the fire-breathing sea monster who was
attacking them, and it goes away.
</P>
<P>
   This, the first musical number in the new animated version of
``The King and I,'' gives an idea of the kinds of departures the
film takes from its original source _ a 1943 novel, ``Anna and the
King of Siam,'' based on the real Anna Leonowens' 19th-century
memoirs _ not to mention its stage and film predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most startling additions, the King of Siam takes a
hot-air balloon ride to search for his runaway son and ends up
dangling from the balloon by a rope like a muscle-proud action
hero.
</P>
<P>
   The animation is done in rich, jewel-like colors, but it seems
strangely flat. The overall film does, too, although the glorious
Rodgers and Hammerstein music makes up for a lot. This should help
make the film enjoyable for adults, but I've never heard a small
child hum ``Hello, Young Lovers'' or ``Shall We Dance?''
</P>
<P>
   The actors who do the characters' voices, including Miranda
Richardson as Anna and Martin Vidnovic as the king, do fine jobs,
but the cartoon characters' faces and body language aren't doing
much of an acting job for them. Films like this illustrate just how
much really goes into brilliant animation.
</P>
<P>
   Every possible opportunity has been taken to add cute animals
and slapstick-comic humans, on the theory that children are always
suckers for that sort of thing. Anna's son, Louis, has a pet monkey
that is always jumping onto the heads of stuffy adults. Tuptim the
slave girl makes friends with a baby elephant that she names
Tusker.
</P>
<P>
   The Kralahome has been turned into an evil wizard (``Let's show
them something truly barbaric'') with a magic screen that lets him
spy on everyone. He also has a short, fat assistant, Master Little,
who is constantly finding himself trapped in a tree or pinned to a
wall or in some other kind of slapstick peril. The film's lifeless
running gag is that Little's teeth fall out, one by one.
</P>
<P>
   The overall story is familiar, of course. In the mid-19th
century Anna, a British widow, travels with her son to Siam to take
a job as tutor to the king's children.
</P>
<P>
   She finds the king stubborn and immorally authoritative but
charming. She clashes with him on matters of tradition and what we
would now call human rights issues, but she also helps him prove to
the English that he is no barbarian. The two eventually bond in a
serious way, as the king's innate wisdom wins out over his ego and
the old ways.
</P>
<P>
   There is one more variation on the plot that parents may want to
know about: In this version the king does not die.
</P>

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Alabama is being seduced by a very attractive neighbor,
Georgia's HOPE Lottery. Her lure appears irresistible, though she
is nothing but a shameless harlot.
 &HT;    Since 1993, the Hope Lottery has given $717 million in HOPE
Scholarships to help 368,000 students pay for college. In-state
students with a high school average of ''B'' may qualify for a HOPE
scholarship to attend a public or private college. If the maximum
$1,500 HOPE Scholarship is spent at a public college, it virtually
pays the tuition, making college ''free.''
 &HT;    In addition, more than 97,000 Georgia adults have earned their
GED (General Equivalency Degree) using HOPE funds.
 &HT;    HOPE funds have also helped 246,000 4-year-olds attend
pre-kindergarten classes.
 &HT;    Finally, a fourth pot of $1.1 billion has been used to buy
computers for schools, colleges and technical institutes.
 &HT;    Furthermore, no new taxes were needed. It is all financed by the
Georgia Lottery, paid for by people who hope their lottery ticket
will make them millionaires. During fiscal 1998, lottery ticket
sales totaled more than $1.72 billion, generating $555.2 million in
profits for the state.
 &HT;    Alabama's new governor, Don Siegelman, a Democrat, defeated a
Republican incumbent, Fob James, by promising to create an Alabama
HOPE Lottery. Alabama's House has passed the bill, but with a price
attached. A number of legislators are insisting that video poker
machines be allowed at four state horse and dog tracks, which fear
going bankrupt with a new competing form of gambling, the lottery.
 &HT;    What's wrong with all this?
 &HT;    1. The poor pay the freight. In 1997, lotteries in 37 states
took $16 billion out of the pockets of the desperate poor hoping
for the jackpot. In Chelsea, a poor section of Boston, there is one
lottery retailer for every 363 residents, many of whom are on
welfare. They spend 8 percent of their incomes on lottery tickets.
In affluent Milton, there is one retailer for every 3,657
residents.
 &HT;    2. ''Get-rich-quick'' schemes seduce the culture. Massachusetts
now sells more than $500 woth of lottery tickets each year for
every man, woman and child in the state. The New York Times
reported that Ernie Kovic, a 28-year-old waiter studying aircraft
design at a trade school, stood in line to buy $3,000 worth of
Powerball tickets, money he was saving for tuition. Why? ''If I
win, I won't have to go to school,'' he said. Of course, he was one
of the 79,999,999 losers. He traded a real future for a hopeless
dream. Ten percent of all lottery players account for half of all
lottery purchasers.
 &HT;    3. Government no longer protects the weak. Alabama's
constitution outlaws gambling, to protect the vulnerable from
''profiting from the desperation of the poor,'' says Dr. James
Dobson in his current letter to 2.4 million families. ''How times
have changed.'' Now they promote gambling with vigor. ''Indeed,
today's politicians love lotteries because they allow them to feed
their voracious appetites for revenues without having to pay the
political price for raising taxes. Truly, the fox is in the
henhouse.''
 &HT;    4. Casinos foster crime, suicide, child abuse. If the price of
getting a lottery in Alabama is that four casinos are set up with a
thousand video poker machines, the social costs will be heavy,
according to Prof. John Kindt, of the University of Illinois.
''Within two years of casinos opening in South Dakota, child abuse
cases went up 42 percent. People losing their paychecks go home and
beat up on the kids. Around casinos, people spent 10 percent less
on food and 25 percent less on clothing and 37 percent have dipped
into savings. And bankruptcies around casinos rose 400 percent in
Memphis after casinos opened in nearby Mississippi. Crime around
casinos has increased 100 percent faster than in non-casino
counties.''
 &HT;    5. Gambling destroys families. ''People who think gambling
revenue is the answer often fail to acknowledge the real problem in
school performance is the number of children born out of wedlock or
whose homes are disrupted by divorce,'' says Gary Palmer, president
of the Alabama Family Alliance. Alabama ranks sixth in the nation
in divorces now. ''Gambling will not fix that problem, it will
contribute to it.''
 &HT;    6. The winners are the rich. Those who received HOPE
scholarships have an average income of $44,876, while Georgia's
average income is $32,359. Why? Hope scholarship are really tax
credits, not grants. If a family's income is so low it pays no
taxes, it cannot collect HOPE.
 &HT;    My question is, are Alabama's religious leaders denouncing the
immorality of the proposed lottery and video poker? Only a few --
too few.

`FORCES OF NATURE': A FILM WITH LITTLE FORCE OR DIRECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does Sandra Bullock's loopy girl-next-door charm really make
audiences want to follow her anywhere? If so, they'd better be
prepared for the amusement-park ride with senior citizens, the
gay-bar strip scene and the antic, hourslong romp through a K-mart
that ``Forces of Nature'' so desperately offers.
</P>
<P>
   This would-be screwball comedy pairs Ms. Bullock's zany drifter
with a nervous groom-to-be (Ben Affleck) who is en route to his
wedding. It's so anxious to bolster this frail comic setup that it
makes every possible detour along the way.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, bohemian Sarah (Ms. Bullock with flowing hair
and heavy eye makeup) shakes the resolve of Ben ( Affleck) to marry
Bridget (Maura Tierney), who fumes her own way through a funnier
part of the movie while stranded in Savannah. Sarah bewitches
straight-arrow Ben in ways that reveal the film's eagerness to turn
itself into ``Something Wild.''
</P>
<P>
   So Sarah and Ben move along from cute hostility (``I don't know
you that well, but I think something may be wrong with you'') to
the inevitable budding romance. But there are complications.
Bridget is appealing, even when being driven crazy by her
quarrelsome parents (Blythe Danner and Ronny Cox) or going to
pieces when a hurricane threatens to wreck the wedding day.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah proves less carefree than she first appeared and has some
unfinished business in Savannah with her young son. Ben quakes to
the film's frequent warnings that marriage is a nightmare, but what
will he do? The film has no good answer. There can't be a focus
group under the sun that would have advocated the ending ``Forces
of Nature'' finally chooses.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Bronwen Hughes (``Harriet the Spy'') and written
by Marc Lawrence, the film shows off Ms. Bullock to amusing if
overly frenetic advantage. It also leaves Affleck without enough of
a Cary Grant aura to play his wimpier character with style. (He's
far more clever in ``Shakespeare in Love.'')
</P>
<P>
   Not even Steve Zahn, who steals the forthcoming ``Happy, Texas''
so hilariously, has enough comic opportunities in the small,
sketchy role of Ben's best man. Some of the gaps are filled in by
special-effects hail and wind storms, which are as close as the
title comes to making any sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces of Nature'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It includes mild profanity and a few suggestive
moments.

CALIF. GOVERNOR GIVES $12 MILLION CHECK FOR LOST JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEADWATERS FOREST RESERVE, Humboldt County, Calif.) _ Standing
on the slope of a fir and redwood grove the new, government-owned
7,500-acre Headwaters reserve, Gov. Gray Davis reflected on the
long battle to buy it and impose tough environmental standards on
about 200,000 acres that the landowner, Pacific Lumber Co., plans
to log nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you come here yourself, and this is my first time, you
cannot understand how awe-inspiring this is,'' Davis said. ``If you
stand up here, you'll understand what this battle was all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he had traveled to Eureka, Calif., to drop off a $12
million check from the state to compensate the Humboldt County
government for lost jobs because of a reduction in logging
operations.
</P>
<P>
   There are no strings attached to the money, which means the
county can use it to, say, put in new sidewalks, start a
job-training program or sweeten the pot for a new Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber President John Campbell, who was in the Board of
Supervisors' chamber during the check ceremony, estimated that
about 250 workers would have to be laid off, although he said a new
cycle of harvesting in the county could mean some would be rehired.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $10 million for local assistance is coming from
the U.S. Department of Interior, which makes a visit by a prominent
federal official likely. Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., a major negotiator in the deal for the
government to buy the land, have yet to visit the new park.
</P>
<P>
   After handing over an enormous mock check, Davis drove to the
reserve, which is about 20 minutes to the south.
</P>
<P>
   As he was speaking to reporters under the trees Wednesday, Davis
noted that one tree probably was 1,000 years old. Another bore blue
markings, signaling it had been destined to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when you're fighting for the redwoods, you're doing
the right thing, but you don't have an emotional investment in the
transaction until you come here to see what you are a small part of
saving,'' Davis said. ``This is just spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of curious hikers already have entered the Headwaters
Forest Reserve since the land was transferred from Pacific Lumber
to the government March 1. Hikers can enter the area through a
narrow, 5-mile trail to the north of the park _ the spout of a
public forest area that resembles a teapot on a map.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal environmental officials fear that visitors to
the new Headwaters park will trample important forest cover. The
area is home to the endangered marbled murrelet, a seabird, and the
point of buying the forest was to help save endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   There likely will be no campgrounds or visitor center or tramway
or revolving restaurant on a hill. Just a simple sign, a marked
trail or two, and a gravel parking lot at the entrance.

DELL SHARES ACCOUNT OF HOW INDUSTRY POWERHOUSE WAS BUILT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people think of Michael Dell as a wunderkind of the
personal computer business.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp., launched from a dorm room at the University
of Texas in 1983, has grown into a powerhouse that generates $18
billion in annual revenues by selling built-to-order PCs.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Dell stock has risen faster than that of any
other publicly traded company during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   What most people are just beginning to realize, though, is that
Michael Dell may well have been the Internet's first entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   By selling PCs to people calling in on the telephone, Dell spent
more than a decade building the quick-response infrastructure
needed to succeed in the emerging world of online selling. Already,
the Dell Web site at www.dell.com generates $12 million in sales
every day. In time, the company expects the Web to account for more
than half of its overall sales.
</P>
<P>
   Such figures start to make perfect sense as you read ``Direct
from Dell'' (Harper Business, $26, 236 pages), a new book penned by
Dell and writer Catherine Fredman.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has crafted an American version of the just-in-time
inventory principles long popularized by Japanese manufacturers.
The secret to Dell's success is that it doesn't start building a
computer until a customer orders it. At the same time, the company
tries to minimize the inventory of parts on hand, maintaining a
rolling parts supply that leaves it holding computer building
blocks in inventory for days or, in some cases, just hours.
</P>
<P>
   That's a crucial advantage in the computer industry, where
technical advances can make old computers as hard to sell as wilted
lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   Dell sells suppliers on just-in-time inventory by promising to
buy more products overall if suppliers will deliver daily or even
hourly.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Dell is emerging as the ultimate broker of
marketplace information, streamlining communications between
customers and suppliers. As the Internet emerges as a widely used
tool, that flow of information is almost sure to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``By using the Internet to maintain a continuous flow of matters
from our suppliers into our factories,'' Michael Dell writes, ``our
people spend less time (to) place orders or expediting parts and
more time adding value.''
</P>
<P>
   But his book is more than a missive on electronic commerce. It
is two very different books in one. The first half is a chatty,
informative, easy-to-read account of how Dell launched and manages
his company.
</P>
<P>
   Interwoven are anecdotal nuggets that provide useful lessons for
businesspeople in any field. Stories highlighting the need for
listening to customers, prioritizing goals, focusing on data and
recruiting employees make this a useful primer for individuals in
small and midsize businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Dell's approach to separating data from
emotion in making business decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come across data that are strikingly different from
what you previously thought, how long does it take for you to shift
your thinking? Do you deny the data and say, `Well, I don't believe
this,' '' Dell asks. ``The longer it takes to accept new data, the
more you're relying on your emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the book, though is more typical of tomes
written by high-profile corporate chief executives. In that
portion, Dell moves more into the mode of preaching on more
nebulous conepts such as ``Expand Your Range of Vision'' and ``Turn
Your Customers Into Teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   The book still weaves some of his personal experience into the
narrative and can be instructive; it's just not as relevant to most
day-to-day business operators as the advice in the first half of
the book.
</P>

   ``Finding and Keeping Great Employees''
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Harris and Joan Brannick
</P>
<P>
   AMACOM, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   Hiring and maintaining good employees is possibly the greatest
challenge of business managers. Yet most companies have roadblocks
in hiring and retention policies that keep many good people from
applying, or, if hired, from staying. Jim Harris and Joan Brannick,
Ph.D.s with a consulting business on human resources, discuss the
trends in this important area.

   ``Global Jumpstart: The Complete Resource for Expanding Small
and Midsize Businesses''
</P>
<P>
   By Ruth Stanat and Chris West
</P>
<P>
   Perseus Books, $25
</P>
<P>
   The authors, both international market researchers, describe
their book as a primer for smaller firms to ``develop a global
mind-set.'' They also offer interesting case studies illustrating
how smaller companies are ``going global.'' Topics include global
research, selling, exporting and marketing.

   ``Close the Deal: Smart Moves for Selling''
</P>
<P>
   By Sam Deep and Lyle Sussman
</P>
<P>
   Perseus Books, $13
</P>
<P>
   Written by a motivational speaker, trainer and consultant, Sam
Deep, and a professor of management at the University of
Louisville, Lyle Sussman, this book helps you devise a selling
``system,'' and then shows you how to stick with it, ultimately
controlling the sale. The book has little narrative, but rather
presents tips, ideas, suggestions and other nuggets of information.
The format is based on two successful previous ``Smart Move'' books
by the authors.

HISTORY SHOWS OSCAR IS A STATUETTE OF LIMITATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Oscars are some big deal. In Hollywood, a festival
atmosphere spins around Oscar night, rather like Derby week in
Louisville or the Super Bowl wherever it's played.
</P>
<P>
   National interest in the Oscars, which unfold Sunday on ABC, has
been ever more frenzied since 1953, when the overdressed ceremony
became a network television event. But what does it all mean? Not
much.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, copping the coveted statuette may strengthen or revive a
career, but many of the major Academy Award conquests, perhaps
most, have been invalidated by the judgment of history.
</P>
<P>
   Consider cinematography, for example. Some years ago, the
cinematography award went to Robert Redford's fine ``A River Runs
Through It,'' which was fine for reasons other than cinematography.
It was poorly photographed. The key to good cinematography is
lighting, and all of the outdoor fly-fishing scenes were too dark.
The scenery was lovely, and that's what members voted on. Year
after year, they confuse cinematography with art direction.
</P>
<P>
   In the acting awards, prejudice and sentiment are traditional
voting tools. Chicanery and intimidation also are heard from. Let's
go all the way back to the second edition in 1929, when Mary
Pickford captured the award (not yet named Oscar) for her first
talking screen appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The academy then was a small and exclusive society, with
membership by invitation, and only board members voted for the
awards. Pickford's win was assured when she invited the whole board
to her Pickfair estate for high tea. Ruth Chatterton probably
should have won for ``Madame X,'' or perhaps the late Jeanne Eagels
for the first screen version of ``The Letter.'' Pickford certainly
shouldn't have won for her insecure performance in ``Coquette.''
The miniscandal had the effect of opening up the academy and giving
everyone the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1930s and '40s, the Oscars gained stature and
respect, despite occasional acts of robbery precipitated by studio
strong-arming. There were, of course, the deferred payoffs, this
actor or that actress winning an Oscar because he or she missed out
the year before, thus recycling injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying the worst of all Oscar calls may be almost as
difficult as trying to determine the worst movie ever made. But
there is wholesale agreement among film scholars that two
performance nods are forever tainted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Harold Russell, having lost both hands in World War II,
played a returning handless veteran in William Wyler's ``The Best
Years of Our Lives.'' He was voted best supporting actor, although
his was the only amateurish performance in a beautifully acted
film. It deprived the great Claude Rains (four times nominated, no
wins) of an Oscar for the keenest sympathetic-villain account of
all time in Alfred Hitchcock's ``Notorious.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for sentiment. How about prejudice?
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Grace Kelly was named Best Actress for a downright poor
performance in ``The Country Girl.'' But Grace Kelly was the new
girl in town, and here she was cast against type, deglamorized; and
Judy Garland was a shopworn commodity, whose virtuoso turn in ``A
Star Is Born'' is a wonder to behold _ a marvel of acting, even if
she hadn't sung a note.
</P>
<P>
   History affirms too many miscarriages of Academy Award justice
than may be recorded here, but let's have a go:
</P>
<P>
   1933: Katharine Hepburn was new and hot, so they gave her the
award for ``Morning Glory,'' her third picture, at the expense of
grand old May Robson, whose glorious Apple Annie in ``Lady for a
Day'' launched director Frank Capra on his string of box-office
smashes. Ironically, Hepburn would lose favor and be denied two or
three Oscars she should have won, long before the academy made
amends by giving her four Best Actress plums.
</P>
<P>
   1935: ``Mutiny on the Bounty'' was a huge MGM moneymaker but not
near the artistic quality of John Ford's ``The Informer'' from RKO,
a studio that had little clout at Oscar time. The Selznick-Cukor
``David Copperfield'' also was (and is) far superior to ``Mutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   1936: MGM's ``The Great Ziegfeld'' is an absolute monstrosity;
there may have been 50 better movies that year. For starters,
consider ``Dodsworth,'' with the superb performance of Walter
Huston, who should have had the award won by Paul Muni for ``The
Story of Louis Pasteur.''
</P>
<P>
   1940: ``Rebecca'' was David Selznick's ``GWTW'' encore, and
Hitchcock's first American-made movie. It's still wonderful, but
Ford's ``The Grapes of Wrath'' was a level above, surely the finest
screen adaptation of a major American novel.
</P>
<P>
   1941: But if Ford was robbed twice previously, the Hearst press
helped make him Best Director and ``How Green Was My Valley'' Best
Picture. It's an honorable achievement, but Orson Welles' ``Citizen
Kane'' is the consensus choice as greatest film never to win the
top Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   1944: The moviegoing public made Leo McCarey's ``Going My Way''
popular, and its Best Picture win came as no surprise. But several
other films, not all of them nominated, were much better _ ``Meet
Me in St. Louis,'' ``Double Indemnity,'' ``Laura,'' perhaps even
``Wilson.'' Taking the Best Picture prize for ``Gentleman's
Agreement'' in 1947, producer Darryl Zanuck saw fit to rebuke the
academy for having passed over ``Wilson'' three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   1950: ``All About Eve'' triumphed. If the voting were held
today, Billy Wilder's ``Sunset Boulevard'' would win easily, and
its stars _ William Holden and Gloria Swanson _ would take the
acting honors that went to Jose Ferrer and Judy Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   1952: ``The Greatest Show on Earth'' as Best Picture? You've got
to be kidding. Finally, they just had to give Cecil B. DeMille an
Oscar. But what about ``The Quiet Man?''
</P>
<P>
   1956: Welcome back, Ingrid Bergman, all is forgiven. So they
gave her the Oscar for ``Anastasia.'' But check out Katharine
Hepburn's cunning in ``The Rainmaker,'' amazingly lifting Burt
Lancaster to her own level.
</P>
<P>
   1962: As a kind of valediction, Gregory Peck is anointed Best
Actor for ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' a role remarkably short in
footage. It pales beside Jack Lemmon's in ``Days of Wine and
Roses.''
</P>
<P>
   1968: Cliff Robertson supposedly ``bought'' the Oscar with an
expensive promotion campaign. His ``Charly'' actually is as worthy
as any of the nominated male performances. The best job _ Charlton
Heston's ``Will Penny'' _ didn't secure a nomination.
</P>
<P>
   1985 and 1991: After a stretch of almost two decades for which
most film and performance arguments are merely academic, the
academy shows its flagrant lack of integrity by giving supporting
performance Oscars to Don Ameche and Jack Palance for ordinary
work, because they endured and came back. Some say this may happen
again, if James Coburn wins for ``Affliction.'' But who's to say he
won't deserve it?
</P>
<P>
   1990: Kathy Bates' villain role in ``Misery'' is the obvious
stuff Oscars are made of. Joanne Woodward's beleaguered wife-mother
in ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge'' is more demanding and more creative.
</P>
<P>
   Oscars of the '90s, though, are too close for historical
evaluations. There surely have been some wrong calls, and more will
come. Still, watch the telecast and enjoy it. Just understand, the
Oscars aren't really so meaningful in the long run.

academy shows its flagrant lack of integrity by giving supporting
performance Oscars to Don Ameche and Jack Palance for ordinary
work, because they endured and came back. Some say this may happen
again, if James Coburn wins for ``Affliction.'' But who's to say he
won't deserve it?
</P>
<P>
   1990: Kathy Bates' villain role in ``Misery'' is the obvious
stuff Oscars are made of. Joanne Woodward's beleaguered wife-mother
in ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge'' is more demanding and more creative.
</P>
<P>
   Oscars of the '90s, though, are too close for historical
evaluations. There surely have been some wrong calls, and more will
come. Still, watch the telecast and enjoy it. Just understand, the
Oscars aren't really so meaningful in the long run.

SOLDIER WHO REFUSED ANTHRAX VACCINE AWAITS COURT-MARTIAL

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A defiant Fort Sam Houston soldier who is refusing
an anthrax vaccination has been demoted and faces a court-martial
for not following orders.
</P>
<P>
   Army Spc. Robert Garner Jr. is charged with refusing to follow
an order requiring that he take the first of six inoculations for
anthrax, a highly lethal biological agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that it is an immoral order,'' Garner said Wednesday.
``I don't think anyone should be able to tell me that I have to
take something like that into my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Garner, 23, is among nearly 100 Americans in uniform who have
refused to take the vaccine. He was told to take the shot because
he was scheduled to be transferred to South Korea, said Phil
Reidinger, a spokesman at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly can refuse to obey the order, but he will pay the
consequences,'' Reidinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Garner was demoted from sergeant for disobeying an order and
faces a court-martial on March 25.
</P>
<P>
   Garner and others contend that the vaccine poses threats to
their health, including the possibility it might trigger Gulf War
Syndrome. That mysterious ailment has struck thousands who helped
drive Saddam Hussein's troops from Kuwait in 1991. More than
150,000 American troops in that conflict received the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says there is no link between the vaccine and the
syndrome, and insists there is nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 218,965 soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines have
received the inoculations, with only one serious reaction requiring
hospitalization, Defense Department spokesman Jim Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine is not 100 percent effective. But the government
will spend $130 million over six years on the vaccine, rather than
risk exposing troops to invisible airborne anthrax spores that
can't be detected until victims develop pneumonia symptoms and face
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an incredibly successful program, and it's something
that we need to do to respond to a real threat,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and Army medical authorities point to the vaccine's
relatively mild side-effects, among them brief periods of soreness,
chills and fever, as proof of its safety.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen has taken the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   But Garner isn't convinced, and he isn't alone. Twenty-three
sailors aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt recently
refused to take anthrax shots, and nine Connecticut Air National
Guard pilots quit rather than roll up their sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Garner said there was no scientific evidence the vaccine would
protect troops against airborne anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration, which has licensed the vaccine
since 1970, tests samples of all vaccine lots, as does the
manufacturer, BioPort Corp. of Lansing, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   A third, independent company performs additional tests to ensure
potency and safety, said Cynthia Vaughan, a spokeswoman with the
U.S. Army Medical Command headquartered at Fort Sam Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Educated consumers are important but this is not comparable to
counting calories,'' Vaughan said.
</P>
<P>
   Garner said he was ready to face trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me you've got to stand for what you believe in or you're
not much of a man,'' he said. ``And to me this is what it's all
about.''

huge increase in steel, and the protectionist movement may gain

`RAVENOUS': HIS FAVORITE DESSERT? WHY IT'S LADY FINGERS! 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's anything worse than a cannibal movie, it's an
undead-cannibal movie with pretensions about Manifest Destiny in
the American West. And the problems with Antonia Bird's
``Ravenous'' don't end there.
</P>
<P>
   Buried beneath laughable fake facial hair and frequently awash
in gurgling blood, a potentially strong cast makes its way in
deadly earnest through material that's often better suited to a
Monty Python skit. The result is better appreciated as a 110-minute
diet aid than as a film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravenous'' begins as a Donner Pass tale of expedient human
recycling, but that's just the kid stuff. Things soon turn even
weirder at the remote outpost in the Sierra Nevada mountains, where
the story is set. (These scenic vistas look authentic despite the
fact that the film was shot in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and
Mexico.)
</P>
<P>
   In this rugged setting, Captain John Boyd (Guy Pearce of ``L.A.
Confidential'') finds himself marooned amid a pack of hirsute
oddballs. Oddest of all is wild-eyed, bushy-bearded Colqhoun
(Robert Carlyle of ``The Full Monty''), who escapes from the
snowbound wilderness looking not nearly as hungry as he should be.
</P>
<P>
   The film could have ended happily with the moment where Colqhoun
is asked just why starvation hasn't made him skinnier. He explains,
with a meaningful look, that the absence of food in the woods
doesn't necessarily mean he hasn't (italics)eaten.(end italics) The
details are left to the imagination for a while, but the culinary
fate of Colqhoun's traveling companions is eventually revealed in
all its oozing, dripping glory.
</P>
<P>
   So is the fact that Colqhoun actually advocates the health
benefits of a human diet. ``I ate five men in three months,'' he
acknowledges. ``Tuberculosis: vanished!''
</P>
<P>
   Having Colqhoun in residence at the military outpost soon
creates problems. For instance, there is a middle-of-the-night
licking incident that frightens another soldier (Jeremy Davies of
``Saving Private Ryan''), even though Colqhoun claims he was merely
having a bad dream.
</P>
<P>
   After this, it begins to be clear that Colqhoun is not the
innocent cannibal that he claimed to be. By the time the movie is
an hour old it features audible baying at the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The story's eat-or-be-eaten tension yields a lot more vicious
fighting than might be expected from a small cast, since cannibals
can dodge death like vampires and still come back for more. The
icing on the cake is the large bear trap featured in the climactic
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is also time for leaden sardonic touches, as
when Carlyle's character presides over a bubbling stew pot to the
tune of ``There's No Place Like Home.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, while chopping up the remains of somebody else in
the cast, Carlyle, an otherwise irresistible actor who has made
three other films with Ms. Bird, has the chance to explain what all
this has to do with the devouring of the frontier. With metaphors
like that, the film doesn't need enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravenous'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). Stomach-turning violence is on the menu.

MAN SUES GUN MAKER CLAIMING WEAPON WAS FAULTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARO ROBBINS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A Texas man is suing the California manufacturer
of his derringer because the .22-caliber pistol put a bullet in his
backside when it fell from the wheelchair he was using at a
veterans hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed Monday in San Antonio federal court, Robert
Curtis accuses Chino, Calif.-based Davis Industries of
manufacturing a faulty weapon that could discharge unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   Davis General Manager Aaron Davis said the company's product is
safe when used properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half-cocked and the safety on, there's no way the gun's going
off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit states Curtis was in a wheelchair at the Veterans
Affairs Hospital in Kerrville when a pouch carrying the pistol
dropped from his waist onto the floor. The gun fired and the
bullet, the lawsuit says, hit him in the buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, a lawyer representing Curtis, said the bullet remains
lodged near his client's spine two years after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, Hall said, is a licensed peace officer who was at the
hospital for treatment related to an automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Veterans Affairs spokesman said Curtis was
off-duty and in the cafeteria when the gun, which was forbidden in
the facility, fired.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Nick Villanueva, said Curtis was treated and
released four days later.
</P>
<P>
   Metal fatigue was part of the pistol's problem, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety mechanism had fractured inside the gun,'' he said.
``When the gun hit the floor, it went off.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar complaint was made against the company in 1997 by a
San Antonio man who claimed he was shot in the leg when his
Davis-made .32-caliber derringer fell from his back pocket as he
removed a handkerchief, hit the floor and fired.
</P>
<P>
   That dispute ended in an undisclosed cash settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, which once advertised its products as ``affordable
personal protection,'' was one of nine gun makers cleared by a
federal jury in New York last month of negligently marketing guns
used in several shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen other companies were found negligent in the same case.

`THE ROOK': A MURDER INVESTIGATION IN A PAST FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first scene of ``The Rook,'' Martin Donovan, dressed like
a character from a Henry James novel (one of his best looks), rides
into town in a mule-driven carriage. Then he photographs a dead
body with what looks like a very modern mini-camera.
</P>
<P>
   The police chief he has come to see wears something resembling
20th-century Chinese fashion and a coat with a bulky fur collar. He
offers his guest ``Tea? Water? Lemon soda?'' Telephones ring like
old alarm clocks, and offices have electric desks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rook,'' whose structure is a murder investigation, has an
intriguing look, a bit like that of the 1984 film version of
``1984.'' It is set in some misconceived future (like the 19th
century, the filmmakers suggest, as it might have been imagined by
someone living in the 16th), and seems to hint at a drastically
different society, one that could, like ``1984'' or ``A Handmaid's
Tale'' (the book, anyway), enlighten us about our own.
</P>
<P>
   But the film never comes through with the information _ any
information _ so the experience of this generally soporific
84-minute film is that of being teased and abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, John Abbott, the detective played by Donovan,
reflects on some group of people, possibly the revolutionists who
have just taken the town he lives in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you realize they've distanced themselves from the church?''
he says. ``They don't even believe in the tempting. The spiritual
reunion.'' This is the most detailed description we hear of the
dominant religion of this time and place.
</P>
<P>
   We also never know who the revolutionists are, what the
revolution is about or where (some imaginary country?) all this
takes place. (Greenwich, where Abbott lives, is apparently not far
from the town of Sutheridge, where the film takes place. And the
murder victim is from Carmel, but something tells me that's not in
northern California anymore.) OK, it's an allegory, but of what
idea(s)? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rook'' was directed by Eran Palatnik, who had previously
done commercials and industrial films. It was written by Richard
Lee Purvis, a first-time screenwriter, and reportedly filmed in 18
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rook'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It contains some strong language, partial
nudity and considerable violence.

   NEW YORK _ The curving road from the Umbrian plains up to the
Basilica of St. Francis in Assisi has been a pilgrim's path for 700

joyousness, took pleasure in both seasons.

<P>
   The great basilica, set on its aqueductlike arches, was begun
soon after his death in 1226 and houses many beauties. The first
flower of a radical new Italian art is here in frescoes by Giotto
and Cimabue. The church treasury is a gold mine of medieval
metalwork and textiles.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder collective hearts skipped a beat when word came in
September 1997 that Assisi had been hit by an earthquake and the
basilica had been damaged, with portions of the painted ceiling of
the upper church reduced to rubble. Plans to finish restoration by
the year 2000 seem to be on track. (The church is scheduled to
reopen at Christmas.) But with much of central Italy still in
recovery from the disaster, government money for rebuilding is
spread thin.
</P>
<P>
   To draw attention to the the situation in Assisi as well as to
showcase a remarkable body of art that was temporarily out of
public view, the Metropolitan Museum collaborated with Italian
cultural agencies and the Vatican to organize ``The Treasury of St.
Francis of Assisi,'' an exhibition of some 70 objects from the
church's holdings, supplemented by 30 related works from other
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Like many ``treasures'' shows, this one is an extravagant
hodgepodge of splendors, embracing illuminated manuscripts produced
in royal scriptoria, exquisite 13th-century paintings and
reliquaries that suggest the fanciful, miniaturist intricacy of
doll houses.
</P>
<P>
   And they are all united by a paradox. They were gifts to the
basilica from the high and mighty of Europe to honor a man who
despised wealth and learning, who wanted to be buried in a pauper's
grave and who lived a life of unconditional, evangelical poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Francis was born at Assisi in 1181 or 1182 to a wealthy merchant
family. A spoiled child, he was a cutup with an eye for fashion and
a taste for pop music, which at the time meant the courtly songs,
idealistic and erotic, of the medieval French troubadours. He soon
dropped out of school, skipped church on Sunday and shrugged off
the prospect of entering the family business.
</P>
<P>
   But after a stint in the army and a long illness, he changed.
One day he stopped on the road and exchanged clothes with a beggar;
next he kissed a leper who was asking only for a handout. At first,
everyone assumed he was just going through a phase, then they
started to view him as a kook.
</P>
<P>
   Their suspicions were confirmed when, without asking permission,
he sold cloth from his father's warehouse to pay for the repair of
a decrepit church, pitching in on the fix-up work himself. He
explained that a voice coming from a crucifix had urged him to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Hauled before a bishop, Francis was ordered to restore what he'd
taken. Instead, he stripped off his clothes and handed them over,
the last remnants of an old life. Thereafter he wore a tunic of
rough brown cloth. He said he liked brown because it was the color
of earth, and some historians have seen his attire as a gesture of
solidarity with a humble peasantry. It was certainly a signal, one
made by the Buddha in India centuries earlier, that doing without
had been elevated to an existential option.
</P>
<P>
   From this point on, Francis' all-or-nothing passions only
intensified. For a while he was fixated on martyrdom and traveled
to Egypt to find it. But the Muslims he encountered knew a saint
when they saw one and received him with cordial respect.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy he founded a religious order but refused to be
consecrated as a priest. A figure of stature in church politics, he
was also a performance artist of enormous charm. (He gave his
itinerant monks a rock-group name, the Jesters of God.) He spurned
books but was an innovative poet: his ecstatic Canticle of the Sun,
inspired by the troubadour songs of his youth, is among the
earliest works in the Italian vernacular. And although he is often
thought of as being fey and not quite all there, he was an
insistent realist who operated on the interesting idea that
everyday life, seen with eyes unclouded by desire and the fears it
produces, is a visionary state. Like the Buddha, he experienced
nature as an extended family in which mutual support, loving
discipline and good manners were the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   What he could not do was care for himself, and heedlessness took
its toll. He died in his mid-40s, lying, as he wished, on the bare
ground. He asked to be buried in a cemetery set aside for criminals
but ended up in the basilica that bears his name. Conceived as a
kind of Franciscan theme park, it was intended to be the largest
Italian pilgrimage site outside of Rome and a magnet both for
ordinary folk and for the secular and ecclesiastical royalty of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Monarchical largesse is the central theme of ``The Treasury of
St. Francis of Assisi,'' organized by Laurence B. Kanter, curator
of the Robert Lehman Collection at the Met, and Pia Palladino, a
research associate. And it is instantly apparent in a monumental
Flemish tapestry hanging directly across from the entrance to the
Lehman wing.
</P>
<P>
   Donated to the basilica in the 15th century by Pope Sixtus IV,
its elaborate pattern takes the form of a family tree tracing a
direct blood line among the pope, St. Francis and the Virgin and
Child in heaven. And self-advertising continues on an embroidered
altar cloth installed in the Lehman wing's lower galleries.
Designed by the painter Antonio Pollaiuolo, it shows Sixtus and
Francis as equals. The saint stands and the pontiff kneels, but
they're almost exactly the same height.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular royal commissions are on display nearby. One of them
is the 13th-century gilded silver Reliquary of the Seamless Robe, a
tabernacle-style triptych with arches and spires and an exquisite
nativity scene rendered in low relief on its back.
</P>
<P>
   Another is a missal thought to have been donated by Louis IX of
France, who had been educated by Franciscan friars in Paris and who
was canonized as a saint in 1297. The book is open to a Crucifixion
painted in royal blue and gold, and its figures, with their thin
necks and large nodding heads, are as slender and elegant as
fiddlehead ferns.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a show-stopper, though, it's the chalice made around
1290 by the Sienese goldsmith Guccio di Mannaia for Pope Nicolas
IV. One of the finest surviving examples of Gothic metal casting,
its stem and base are covered with raised leaf and ribbon motifs
and studded with 80 enamel plaques depicting saints, angels,
biblical scenes and the inevitable papal portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Francis is included in this VIP gallery, but one gets a far more
vivid sense of his spirit in the paintings on view. He appears, for
example, dressed in his familiar brown tunic in an altarpiece
attributed to the so-called Master of St. Francis, the artist who
painted the earliest frescoes of the saint's life at Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those frescoes vanished long ago, and the altarpiece,
reassembled for the show from panels in various museum collections,
is fragmentary. But there is no question that its style _ a
softening of Byzantine formality with a fresh, funky naturalism,
evident in the saint's plump white hands and pensive face _ has a
distinctly personable, Franciscan feel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And Francis takes center stage in the renowned panel by the
artist known as the Master of the Treasury. Here he is typecast as
an unsmiling Byzantine saint, but he is framed by four lively
illustrations of miracles said to have occurred soon after his
death. In one scene, a possessed woman thrashes spasmodically as a
demon flies from her mouth; in another, a crippled man regains the
use of his legs after touching the saint's tomb.
</P>
<P>
   If this work was executed in the second third of the 13th
century, as the show's catalog proposes, one can assume it had a
sense of personal immediacy for its early viewers, some of whom had
probably known Francis. And because the painting's wood panel was
reputed to have been used in preparing the saint's body for burial,
the work itself qualifies as a relic, still radiant with his
energy.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be too far-fetched to view many of the objects from
the Assisi treasury as similarly, if less directly, animated by his
presence. The altar vessels and embroideries are emblematic of a
material magnificence that he rejected. But the impulse to give
tangible form to the ineffable that they represent, so vital to
popular religion, is something he understood well.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, at the outset of his own brilliant, earthshaking
career, he listened to an image that spoke to him and, at the risk
of name and fortune, set about repairing a ruined church. That
church, San Damiano, still stands near Assisi. And one likes to
think that Francis' handyman skills and restorative zeal are at
work today in the hilltop basilica that bears his name.

A DIALOGUE BETWEEN EAST AND WEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Western rationalism versus Eastern mysticism is the theme of
``The Monk and the Philosopher,'' a dialogue between
representatives of each side of that great divide who happen to be
father and son. The father and the philosopher is Jean-Francois
Revel, a leading political commentator in France. His earlier
books, most notably ``The Totalitarian Temptation'' and ``How
Democracies Perish,'' were important documents of the Cold War,
stirring affirmations of liberal-democratic values when, in Revel's
view, they were being undermined by self-doubt, guilt and utopian
illusions in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Matthieu Ricard, born in 1946, is Revel's son. (Their surnames
are different because Revel is a pseudonym.) He has a doctorate in
molecular biology, but rejected a career in science (``an endless
dispersion into detail,'' he says, that is unable to ``solve the
fundamental questions of life'') to become a Buddhist monk. He
lives in Nepal, occasionally serves as a translator for the Dalai
Lama, whom he reveres, and translates Tibetan manuscripts into
French and English.
</P>
<P>
   Ricard, not surprisingly, is a fervent believer in what he
regards as the Buddhist ``science of the mind,'' the mastery of
``the absolute truth,'' which he sees as a more fundamental and
profound salvation for humankind than anything that Western
rationality can offer. But Ricard, with his deep knowledge of
science and European thought, can argue his points from within the
Western tradition, and that is what gives this conversation its
special promise.
</P>
<P>
   In places the promise is realized. One reads these often
difficult dialogues with an appreciation for the seriousness and
intellectual depth of both participants. Revel is a gently
skeptical prober of his son's beliefs, for example, pressing him to
defend and refine points he makes on reincarnation. Ricard has a
broad knowledge of his subject, which he explains in often
trenchant, metaphorical fashion. He says reincarnation is not
simply the phenomenon of being born over and over, as many assume
it to be, but has more to do with the transmission of a stream of
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Different readers will come to different conclusions after
finishing this book. I ended up agreeing with Revel, who concludes,
``I have become more and more appreciative of Buddhism as a system
of wisdom, and more and more skeptical about it as a system of
metaphysics.''
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, Revel is unable to accept, say, reincarnation
merely on Ricard's say-so, and Ricard's ultimate argument is that
if you haven't spent years in meditation, the only path to the
absolute truth, it will be impossible for you to understand the
world as he has come to know it.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from the question of agreement with either the
philosopher or the monk, too often both seem to talk past each
other, issuing careful, politely crafted statements of position
that are not responsive to what was said just before. Revel at
times seems unwilling to press the rationalist case, and he does
not ask what seem to be the obvious questions at critical points.
Ricard is rather repetitive in his arguments, returning again and
again to the same few points as if simple reiteration will make
matters clear.
</P>
<P>
   Most interesting would be a far greater sense of Ricard's
experience, a description of his trajectory from Western
rationality to Eastern wisdom. He does sketch in his experience
early on, but very briefly. He tends to explain Buddhism in
scholarly and abstract terms when one really wants to know what it
was like to meditate in a hut for years. What does enlightenment
feel like?
</P>
<P>
   ``For anyone who's attained the omniscience of Buddhahood,
there's no longer any discrepancy between the ultimate nature of
things and the way they appear,'' Ricard says. ``The perception of
apparent phenomena continues, but the perception's no longer
distorted by the ignorance of taking such phenomena as entities
that have some intrinsic existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Here Ricard is trying to explain the concept of ``emptiness''
and how it differs from nothingness, which in turn is related to
the Buddhist concept of the illusory nature of the apparent world.
</P>
<P>
   Revel accuses him of playing with words, and one tends to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an absolute point of view, the world doesn't have any
real or concrete existence,'' Ricard says a little later. ``So the
relative aspect is the phenomenal world and the absolute aspect is
emptiness.'' If you understand that statement, you probably don't
need to read this book.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that one fails to appreciate the courage and
power of Ricard's spiritual search. His main point has to do with
the belief in the self, in solid, individual identities as the
source of all ignorance and therefore all suffering. ``Buddhism
recommends a very detailed investigation of the notion of ego,''
Ricard says early on.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat later: ``What we want to abolish is the illusion, the
mistake that has no inherent existence in the first place.'' No
doubt that fundamental notion, the dissolution of selfishness and
the acquisition of a tranquil kindness, is what has given Buddhism
its growing appeal in the West. Ricard speaks of it eloquently.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, another element in this picture is strangely missing,
and that is the sense of a personal relationship between this
father and son. There is some cursory acknowledgment of their
relationship early on in ``The Monk and the Philosopher,'' but then
that theme is dropped in favor of an exchange that could have
occurred between two strangers at some ecumenical conference.
</P>
<P>
   After all, here we have a son who, in adopting Tibetan monks as
his teachers, rejected the very rational system that his father
famously embodies. The Oedipal theme practically screams out.
</P>
<P>
   That neither the monk nor the philosopher seems to hear it comes
across as a concealment carefully maintained in a conversation that
supposedly addresses the deeper meanings of things, or, as Ricard
puts it, the absolute truth.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Old Wabbit is Wehabilitated
</P>
<P>
   It still makes one of the better cartoon standoffs. The year is
1936 and in Tom Palmer's animated short Cupid is doing his best to
bury arrows into the obstinate W.C. Fields and an equally irascible
woman with whom, or so Cupid supposes, Fields might make a match.
</P>
<P>
   A tall assignment. Using trash-can lids as shields, the cartoon
Fields battles back with everything he can lay his hands on. In the
end its takes a firing squad of small Cupids dressed as Canadian
Mounties to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the suddenly smitten Fields and his now rapturous
``little chickadee'' will gambol in the restored ``Cupid Gets His
Man,'' one of 15 animated features on a video called ``Cartoon
Crazys Sci-Fi,'' to be released by Winstar.
</P>
<P>
   Together with two other animated collections, ``Cartoon Crazys
Kids All-Time Favorites'' and ``Superman: The Lost Episodes,'' the
video joins a large-scale cartoon reclamation project under way at
Audio Galaxy, a production company based in the Universal Studios
complex in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of cartoons from the 30s and 40s, many of them in
tatters, have been rescued from dusty places. Pieced back together
and sent to England for a special bath, they look clean and fresh
on tape and especially on digital video disk.
</P>
<P>
   One Audio Galaxy collection, ``Max Fleischer's Superman,'' drawn
from the original series that ended in 1942, has been a best seller
on tape and disk for several months. With the three titles to be
released on Tuesday, 14 hours of vintage cartoons are on tape.
</P>
<P>
   The DVDs, which usually are issued shortly after the cassettes,
include much extra material, from plot synopses to histories of the
films and recommended reading lists.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these cartoons were made by the studios to run in
theaters before feature films. ``Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd: The
Wabbit Who Came to Supper'' and ``Doggone Tired,'' both on
``Cartoon Crazys 2,'' are examples.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, a Fleischer cartoon cost $100,000 to produce, an
equivalent of several million dollars today. ``If they played
before an M-G-M film or other A-list feature, the studios wanted
them nice,'' said Tom Reich, director of the Cartoon Crazys series.
``They wanted a Popeye or a Disney, or they wanted adult-oriented
cartoons that were made in the 30s before censorship came in.''
</P>
<P>
   These would include the adventures of the sweetly sexy Betty
Boop. In ``House Cleaning Blues,'' another title in ``Cartoon
Crazys Sci-Fi,'' the miniskirted Betty laments having to clean up
after what must have been a very lively party. All the whisky
glasses and ashtrays bothered censors, as did Betty herself, who in
other films brought out the groper in some of her male
acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   In those times cartoons often were judged to be too violent,
though they were usually bucolic by present standards. An example
is ``To Spring,'' a fascinating contest between old man winter
howling from above and an underground army of elves all working
madly to pump spring colors and fragrance up through the soil.
</P>
<P>
   On the same tape, ``Cob Web Hotel'' features a spider that, as
spiders do, dismembers flies before dining. Critics dubbed it the
first snuff cartoon. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pleasantville
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the placid 50s scene he sees on reruns of his
favorite 50s show, a high school student named David (Tobey
Maguire, with Marley Shelton) and his unwilling, very 90s sister,
Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), get sucked into that world through
their television set.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the tube, Dad (William H. Macy) yells the inevitable
``Honey, I'm home'' and Mom (Joan Allen) obligingly has those
artery clogging meals on the table at 6 sharp. Chafing at the
sterility, the liberated Jennifer shakes up the young set, and even
David sees the need to introduce change and passion.
</P>
<P>

   Mighty Joe Young
</P>
<P>
   After his mother is shot by hunters who want to pack him off to
a zoo, a baby gorilla called Joe escapes and grows tall in the
bush. That's 15 feet tall, a good height for theme park planners.
Cared for by a leggy blond naturalist named Jill (Charlize Theron),
Joe eventually gets flown to Los Angeles after a well-meaning
zoologist (Bill Paxton) convinces Jill that the gorilla would be
better off in a specially prepared natural habitat (or as natural
as it gets in Los Angeles).
</P>
<P>
   Joe, however, gets upset and goes on a mild rampage in a film
that ``is essentially `King Kong' for kids. Very young kids''
(Stephen Holden). &QL;

   To help her bourgeois father with his money problems, the
beautiful Francesca (Ines Sastre) agrees to marry a sleazy,
affluent older businessman (Dario Cantarelli) who can brighten the
financial situation.
</P>

   The year being 1899 and the place a small north Italian town,
the situation necessarily places restraints on the young woman, who
tries to leverage herself out of her intolerable predicament by
attaching herself to the best man (Diego Abatantuono).

   Freshly divorced and desperately needing direction, Judith
(Holly Hunter) pours her heart out to everyone she meets. Soon she
is taken under the wing of a cabaret singer (Queen Latifah) who
helps change her life and a kindly doorman (Danny DeVito) who turns

`TRUE CRIME': EASTWOOD STARS IN A STORY OF SECOND CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``True Crime,'' Clint Eastwood makes his entrance perched on
a barstool, putting his codgerly moves on a 23-year-old blonde.
Flashing a silly grin, he looks worn and more than a little
ludicrous. That's the point, since Steve Everett, the veteran
newspaper reporter whom he plays, has a knack for the embarrassing
fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   His failures are both professional and personal. We next see him
courting both by sleeping with another blonde, the wife of his
editor, so flagrantly that the angry editor (Denis Leary) knows he
has to call his own house if he's looking to find Everett. This is
no way to land plum assignments, needless to say. Nor is it a way
for Everett to redeem all the past missteps that are indirectly
summoned by this film's title.
</P>
<P>
   In his most quietly poignant film since ``A Perfect World,''
Eastwood directs a death row thriller with redemption very much in
mind. It's about what happens when Steve's drinking companion is
killed in a car crash and he is hauled in to replace her on the
so-called human interest beat. She had been scheduled to talk to a
convicted murderer named Frank Beachum, played powerfully and
affectingly by Isaiah Washington, on the day of his scheduled
execution. Into the breach steps the jaded, sardonic Everett, who
isn't the type to play hero, but . . . well, you can take it from
here.
</P>
<P>
   In an involving thriller that takes on growing urgency as
Everett gets hooked by the Beachum case, Eastwood devotes as much
attention to rueful character study as he does to the crime story
at hand. The sources of Everett's cynicism are laid out carefully.
(``Great work, Steve,'' says James Woods as the top editor of the
Oakland newspaper for which Everett works, once Everett starts
suggesting Beachum may be innocent. ``Should we hold the front
page, or wait for two unnamed sources, or what?'')
</P>
<P>
   So is his way of exasperating anyone who deals with him. So is
the wreck he has made of his home life, with an apparently reckless
alcoholic past and a marriage (with Diane Venora as his wife) that
hangs together by a thread. ``If this were a bullet,'' she
eventually says, slamming down her wedding ring, ``you'd be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The one bright light in Everett's life is an adorable daughter
who brings out the best in him. (Though Eastwood is noticeably
older than the man he plays, there's no arguing with the
plausibility of his having such an enchanting young child. She is
his daughter, Francesca Fisher-Eastwood, which is perhaps why he
addresses her so fondly as ``Ya little goon.'') No less touching,
for either Everett or the audience, is the pretty little girl on
whom Beachum dotes with equal affection.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it begins to examine just why Beachum, who is black, has
been convicted for the killing of a pregnant white college student
at a convenience store, ``True Crime'' strikes a deeper note as it
watches Everett get in touch with his inner good guy. It watches
wrenchingly as Beachum and his wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton, so
impressive in ``Beloved'') prepare their final farewells, which are
among the film's most devastating moments. Then the clock-ticking
suspense rises to a breathless crescendo, one that gives some
unexpected new twists to death row suspense. The film's biggest
surprise comes in an especially effective final scene.
</P>
<P>
   As sharply written by Larry Gross, Paul Brickman and Stephen
Schiff from a mystery novel by Andrew Klavan, ``True Crime'' is
directed by Eastwood with righteous indignation and increasingly
strong momentum. As in ``A Perfect World,'' his direction is
galvanized by a sense of second chances and tragic
misunderstandings, and by contrasting a larger sense of justice
with the peculiar minutiae of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he goes a shade too far in the latter direction, though.
A-1 Steak Sauce and potato chips play much more significant roles
in the convenience store killing than anyone might expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``True Crime'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It includes re-enactments of violence and an
implicit sexual situation.

`SPARKLER': HER PSYCHIC'S NO FRIEND AND NEITHER IS HER MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Melba May (Park Overall), the sarcastically nicknamed title
character of Darren Stein's confused, overwrought comedy
``Sparkler,'' is a not-so-dumb blond naif who lives in a trailer
park in the California desert somewhere between Los Angeles and Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The film's opening scenes ridicule Melba's world of dime store
dreams (she fantasizes about winning a publishing house sweepstakes
jackpot) and trashy taste (her trailer and the area around it are
littered with toy animals and hideous tchotchkes). And at first the
movie appears to be nothing more than a cheap satirical shot at the
rural Western pool of potential guests on ``The Jerry Springer
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sparkler'' becomes even more condescending after Melba catches
Flint (Don Harvey), her husband of 15 years, in bed with a friend
and moves in with her mother, Sherri (Grace Zabriskie), a
beautician. By the time Sherri consults a ``psychic friend'' on the
telephone who tells her that Melba will soon meet three kings, the
joke and the caricatured acting have begun to wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, those kings appear, but they're not exactly
royalty. At the Backwoods Bar, a local watering hole, Melba meets
three young men from Los Angeles whose car had a flat tire en route
to Las Vegas. Brad (Freddie Prinze Jr.), the leader of the crew, is
a smooth self-styled Lothario who fantasizes about becoming a
powerful Hollywood agent. His companions, Trent (Jamie Kennedy) and
Joel (Steven Petrarca), are each nursing secret sexual wounds that
are revealed as the story goes along.
</P>
<P>
   When the begowned and bejeweled Melba, whom Trent
condescendingly compares to a disco ball, returns home from the bar
and discovers the loss of her mother's $29.95 crystal teardrop
earrings, she calls Brad on his car phone to see if he found the
missing bauble. When he says yes Melba impulsively heads for Las
Vegas, hoping to stay with an old high school chum named Dottie
Delgato (Veronica Cartwright), who moved there two decades before
to be a showgirl. Dottie turns out to be a tough, over-the-hill
dancer named Lady Luck who is reduced to doing lascivious things
with a twirling baton in a low-end strip bar called the Crack.
Although she lives above the club with its butch, lesbian owner, Ed
(Sandy Martin), their living arrangement doesn't prevent Dottie
from chasing men when a juicy opportunity presents itself. When she
lays eyes on Brad in a hotel lobby she throws herself at him with a
scary ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   It is around this point that ``The Sparkler'' shifts emotional
gears and reveals Melba to be a sweet innocent with a heart of gold
and blessed with instinctive wisdom and compassion. Suddenly she
changes from a derisive object of caricature into a folksy
common-sense heroine of the sort played by Judy Holliday, Melanie
Griffith or Faith Prince.
</P>
<P>
   The production notes tell us that ``Sparkler'' was inspired by
Diane Arbus photographs. But the change of attitude from contempt
for its characters into a we-are-all-freaks sentimentality doesn't
earn that comparison. ``Sparkler'' feels more like a movie that
wants to have its cake and eat it too. In its inability to sustain
a consistent tone, it recalls the weaker episodes of Norman Lear's
1970s mock-soap opera, ``Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sparkler'' is further undermined by indecisive editing, dingy
cinematography and a soundtrack in which some of the dialogue
verges on the inaudible. But its worst flaw is a wild inconsistency
of acting styles. Prinze, Kennedy and Petrarca suggest
shell-shocked refugees from a slick teen-age comedy who have
wandered into the wrong movie.

<P>
   There he is, unmistakably, the Englishman abroad: stiff,
self-conscious, bewildered, amused, always polite and always a bit
embarrassed. His hands are locked tensely over his midriff; his
smile is eager and uneasy. You've seen his kind before, probably,
furrowing their brows over unpronounceable items on menus, making
jokes over not knowing the word for water closet.
</P>
<P>
   This particular Englishman, however, is grappling with something
more than basic language and custom barriers. He is making his way
through Israel and the Palestinian territories, and he finds
himself in the presence of a ferocious, unconditional commitment to
a place and an idea called home. Something to kill and to die for.
Something indeed alien to a visiting stranger from a land of
measured emotions and relative values, a place where, as he puts it
with distancing crispness, ``nobody believes in anything anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the persona, a graver, distinctly English variation on
Mark Twain's traveling American innocents, worn by the British
playwright David Hare in his sad, funny and deeply engaging one-man
show, ``Via Dolorosa,'' which opened Thursday night at the Booth
Theater. Hare is not an actor by trade, and he uses whatever
awkwardness he may feel at being alone on a stage to recreate the
awkwardness of the outsider he was when he first visited the Middle
East two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   His perplexity has been given a formal, slightly exaggerated
shape that is both affecting and, against the odds, truly
theatrical. Working with the inventive director Stephen Daldry,
best known here for the Broadway revival of ``An Inspector Calls,''
Hare transforms what might have been the sort of monologue with
which Victorian travel writers once toured into a fluid dialogue
between an observer and his subjects, people who will always puzzle
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coals to Newcastle,'' said two of my friends, using exactly
the same words on separate occasions, when told that Lincoln Center
would be bringing ``Via Dolorosa'' to New York. It's true that the
Gordian knot that is the Middle East is under perpetual discussion
in this city, whether on radio or television, in heated dinner
table arguments, or in the pages of newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Hare, however, isn't out to provide political analysis or even
to create characters from within as he habitually does in his
plays, works of fiery polemics and passions in their own right,
like ``Plenty,'' ``Skylight'' and ``The Secret Rapture.'' He
doesn't do proper impersonations as, say, Anna Deveare Smith does,
in her one-woman representations of cultural conflict in America.
Nor is he the unmoved, recording camera that Christopher Isherwood
aspired to be in his stories of Berlin. Instead, without pretending
to be anyone else, he channels the fraught, intense voices of Arabs
and Jews, of politicians and theater people and bureaucrats,
through the consciously limited, but far from insensate, instrument
of his own solid self.
</P>
<P>
   It all takes place on a stage that looks but isn't quite naked:
a series of platforms with a bridge, artfully designed by Ian
McNeil and lighted by Rick Fisher, that matches the deceptive
simplicity of Hare's presentation and allows for one startling
moment of visual epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   The people whom Hare summons into being range widely. The Jewish
and Arab co-producers (seen separately) of a ``Romeo and Juliet''
in Jerusalem vividly recall the eight-year creation of the
production, with Palestinians and Jews as the Capulets and
Montagues, that quickly turned out to be ``not about love but
hate.'' Hare finds the fierce internal divisions within each of the
opposing sides in short, resonant character portraits: of Haidar
Abdel Shafi, a courtly, venerated politician in Gaza who speaks of
internal corruption, ``a society where law is neglected and never
enforced,'' and of Shulamit Aloni, a firebrand member of the former
Yitzhak Rabin administration who is the inspiration for Hare's most
poignant portraiture, who says gloomily, ``We're going backwards,''
but still speaks with the ferocity of a fighter in the front ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Hare spends a Sabbath in the West Bank home of transplanted
Jewish-Americans, where dinner table discussion reaches such
violent heights that he learns ``to avoid trigger words like Rabin
or Bible.'' ( Hare's pronunciation of those words here does indeed
turn them into explosive devices.) Throughout, arguments over
arcana of the Bible are as intense as those about contemporary
animosities. Benny Begin, the son of Menachem, answers a question
about Israeli objections to the Oslo accord by talking about a
Hebrew message on a stone dating from nearly 600 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   This ability to find ancient history as fresh and relevant as
yesterday's bloodshed is described by Hare with a self-parodying
air of intimidation, but the awe is genuine. This wonderment comes
across even more clearly, in the work's most poetic passages, when
Hare considers the very geography that has given rise to these
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling into the West Bank, he says, ``I feel the
topography,'' and is confounded to find himself realizing that
``for the first time I understand how odd, how egregious Israel
must look to the Arab eye.'' The contrasts between Arab and Israeli
communities are delivered with a journalist's unsparing eye. Yet he
pauses for a moment of rapture, after following the Via Dolorosa,
the mythic but now prosaic-looking setting of Jesus' last walk
through Jerusalem, and arrives on a plaza. Looking across the Mount
of Olives, he says, ``Oh I see, how provoking it is to own
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Daldry has steered Hare into assuming large, expressly dramatic
gestures, with raised arms and clenched fists, as if a more
naturalistic posture wouldn't capture the magnitude of the emotions
with which he is dealing. It should be noted that his performance
has broadened somewhat, no doubt a reaction to the more responsive
nature of American audiences, since I first saw it in London last
fall. But its essence is the same. There is in his very presence an
implicit question mark, a yearning both to understand and to know
what it is like and to feel the certainty of the people he
interviews, even as they admit the divisions among their own kind.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``My subject as a playwright has been faith,'' Hare says. More
particularly, however, it has been the elusiveness of faith, as
evidenced in his ``Amy's View,'' which opens on Broadway next
month. The discrepancy between the individualism of Hare's world
and the holistic worldviews of the lands he visits is what gives
``Via Dolorosa'' its particular dramatic tension. It does so in
ways that allow for both rich humor and a wistful, wondering
sorrow, emotional resonances that easily eclipse Hare's previous
Broadway offering, the very successful and very disaffected ``Blue
Room.''
</P>
<P>
   At the show's end, Hare narrates, in reverberant detail, the
process of returning to London, of arriving anew at the place he
calls home. But there is implicitly another idea of home at work in
``Via Dolorosa,'' and that is the theater itself. In his opening
remarks, Hare speaks of ``the elaborate conventions of theater, so
loved _ by me at least _ so treasured. So much the very heart of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   That heart beats reassuringly in ``Via Dolorosa.'' Even as the
play examines irresoluble strife and antagonism, it finds the
symmetry, patterns and even the beauty within. It finds, in other
words, as good plays always will, the echoing poetry within the
dangerous chaos that is life.

   RAILWATCH _ A new nonprofit group, RailWatch, says it is
``composed of more than 300 public officials, dedicated to
educating the public about rail safety issues.'' At a Washington
news conference in February, the group issued a report titled ``Why
is there a train accident every 90 minutes?'' and demanded
congressional action. But some of the 300 public officials have
since said they had no idea they were enlisting as supporters when
they stopped by a RailWatch booth at a convention last year. And it
turns out the group has a quiet corporate backer: United Parcel
Service (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

him regularly and helped Murnen pull through. Jay recovered and
tried out for the Miami team. He was cut but took on the manager's
role. Earlier this month, the younger brother died of bone cancer
at age 19. Now, Wally Szczerbiak and the others say they want to

 &HT;    Turkey? Lox? Egg? A menu will tell what's in a name
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 21.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever wonder how celebrity sandwiches get named?
</P>
<P>
   Looking down the rotating list of 24 celeb-wiches at the Stage
Deli, one can't help pondering hidden significance in the
ingredients. Why is there tongue only on the Bill Cosby and Winona
Ryder? Why does the Julia Roberts alone feature hard-boiled egg?
There is no mystery in how the Dolly Parton (twin rolls of pastrami
and corned beef) was named, but doesn't a persona like Marv Albert
demand more complex ingredients than mere corned beef and Swiss
cheese?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who's on that list has been here, and that's the
sandwich they ask for,'' says Gil Kashkin, manager of the
62-year-old noshery. ``We change the names regularly, but a few _
like Joe DiMaggio, Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand _ stay the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Up the street at the archrival Carnegie Deli, owner Sandy Levine
scoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbra Streisand will eat chopped liver when I grow hair on my
head! They'll put any fly-by-night on that list _ hot today, gone
tomorrow? Adam Sandler?! C'mon!''
</P>
<P>
   The 1-year-older Carnegie (founded 1936) prides itself on having
only two celeb sandwiches. The Woody Allen (``lotsa corned beef
plus lotsa pastrami,'' says the menu) was established after the
filmmaker shot scenes of ``Broadway Danny Rose'' in the deli.
Henny's (Youngman) Heaven (Nova lox and cream cheese on toasted
bagel) salutes the late comic, who used to stand up and try out new
material on his fellow diners.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you see we have a higher standard,'' says Levine, whose
cousin, Paul Zollinger, owns the Stage. ``If Hillary Clinton comes
in and asks for (her own sandwich) while she's running for senator,
they might do it down the street, but it ain't gonna happen here.
We have a higher god.''

 &HT;    The deli planet: New York pate of mind deli-cious
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 21.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 30 years old, Jennifer Miller of Athens (GA.) had
her first matzo ball but swore it would not be her last.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of a Big Apple vacation with her engineer
husband, Steve, the Georgia schoolteacher went to the famed
Carnegie Deli for her first real taste of ``deli'' _ the taste, one
could argue, of a vanishing New York of yore. The pepperiness of
pastrami, the lusciousness of lox, the garlicky tang of pickles so
steeped in brine that they're almost white: these are treats that
clog the heart with cholesterol and joy. And real deli gets harder
to find every year. So here were the Millers again on Day 2,
waiting in the busy sidewalk line for the Carnegie Sunday brunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough meat in those sandwiches for five normal ones _
they make your eyes pop out,'' Jennifer enthused. ``To the folks
back home I would say: Anything that you thought was a deli before
you came here _ isn't!''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, New York is not only the capital of deli _ it is deli,
in ways that are mysterious and profound. Deli outside New York is,
somehow, a shadow of itself, for it was here in Gotham that so many
Jewish immigrants landed in the 19th and early 20th centuries,
carrying their written and unwritten recipes from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Their delicatessen was originally working-class provender, the
people's food. It served as the raw fuel of upward mobility. The
immigrants strove, raised families, noshed, debated politics and
culture and sports between bites, and noshed some more. They were
what they ate, and what they ate was pungent, salty, richly
flavorful. You can see their descendants on, say, ``Seinfeld.''
Sure, the show was set in a bland diner marked ``Restaurant,'' and
some of the wacky characters had Italian and Greek surnames, but it
was all a ploy to make the show more marketable to diverse
audiences. No, these are really deli people. They have deli
attitude and talk deli talk. Every time they bite into a grilled
cheese, think: It's really a Reuben, with sauerkraut and Thousand
Island dressing slithering out the sides.
</P>
<P>
   As a gentile living in the South, I always thought deli was
simply great eating. But as I've gotten older and returned
regularly to New York I've begun to appreciate that for Jews, deli
is so much more: a state of mind, a cultural touchstone, a glow of
fullness and well-being that radiates from the belly to the spirit.
Perhaps it's Jewish soul food?
</P>
<P>
   Even more than Southerners like to debate barbecue or Texans to
deconstruct chili, New Yorkers love to argue about deli. Witness
the recent Chopped Liver War. When Ron Rosenbaum wrote in the New
York Observer last summer that the chopped chicken liver at the
Barney Greengrass deli is ``the supreme achievement of
Jewish-American civilization,'' he was ridiculed in New York
magazine by Gael Greene. Her own chopped liver picks were topped by
the takeout counter at Zabar's. The journalistic salvos went back
and forth all autumn, with hotter-than-horseradish letters to the
editor on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   I tracked down Rosenbaum (who claims to have been vindicated in
The Jewish Daily Forward on the issue of Greengrass' chopped liver)
and invited him to serve as my guest deli critic.

 &HT;    The deli planet: Samples of five only - in - New York Eateries
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 21.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert

<P>
   NEW YORK _ K A T Z' S
</P>
<P>
   Now the truth can be told. When the famous ``fake orgasm'' scene
in ``When Harry Met Sally'' was filmed in Katz's, Meg Ryan's verbal
expressions of rapture were not entirely forced. She'd just eaten
the pastrami.
</P>
<P>
   As for the hot dogs, ``They are indescribable _ maybe the best
ever,'' says New York Observer writer Ron Rosenbaum, serving as my
guest deli critic. When it comes to ambience, Katz's is the real
deal, the holy of holies among delis. Founded in 1898 in the heart
of the Jewish Lower East Side, it is marked by a 1950s sign of red
letters on white plastic squares that looks very much like the
Varsity's. And not unlike that North Avenue landmark, Katz's ``has
a kind of funky, populist splendor,'' in Rosenbaum's words, and a
legend based on the fattiest of delights.
</P>
<P>
   Katz's is cafeteria style, vast and noisy, more of a dining hall
than a restaurant. The decor, if you can call it that, froze around
World War II. There are neon signs for vanished beers (Rheingold,
Ballantine) that quenched many a thirst at Brooklyn Dodgers games.
``Send a salami to your boy in the Army!'' proclaims one wartime
sign, craftily converting Katz's mail-order business into an act of
patriotism. Among the satisfied customers pictured on the wall:
President Clinton, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter and boxing promoter
Don King.
</P>
<P>
   My choice for funniest sign: ``Wine, red/white/rose: $3.05
glass.'' I saw no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Along one wall, half a block long, is the self-serve counter and
behind it a continuous cutting board where men in greasy aprons
spear great briskets and pastramis and fling them on the board with
a slippery thud, like fishermen landing their whoppers on a dock.
The deli men saw away at the meat to keep up with the frantic
demand. The air is filled with the tinny clatter of steam-table
lids, the barking of food orders. Customers crowd the counter (few
tables have wait service) to place their orders, ``feet dancing
with impatience,'' in the words of an amateur poet whose tribute to
Katz's is displayed in the front window.
</P>
<P>
   To make the wait more bearable, the carvers have the charming
custom of handing you the first slice of meat as a kind of
bare-handed hors d'oeuvre (napkins are available, too).
</P>
<P>
   When my exquisite corned beef on a kaiser roll was ready, the
man flung several pickle spears at the plate with the abrupt
insouciance so typical of Katz's. Luckily, two stuck.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heavenly lunch.
</P>
<P>
   205 E. Houston St. (at Ludlow Street), 212-254-2246.
</P>
<P>
   2 N D A V E N U E D E L I
</P>
<P>
   This establishment is to food what Katz's is to atmosphere:
tops. Rosenbaum says the crowded, aroma-filled restaurant is
``great for just about anything,'' but his particular favorites are
the matzo ball soup, noodle pudding and ``anything stuffed''
(cabbage, derma, breast of veal).
</P>
<P>
   ``And of course the pastrami's wonderful,'' Rosenbaum adds,
``but for God's sake don't order it lean or you defeat the whole
purpose of pastrami.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the main dining room has been remodeled with a pleasant,
nondescript decor, circa 1960s, the deli has stood on this corner
since the turn of the century and served as the gustatory
crossroads of one of New York's most colorful neighborhoods.
Actress Molly Picon held court here up through the 1960s, and one
of the smaller rooms has memorabilia of her and other Yiddish
theater stars. On the same block one can find Polish and Ukrainian
restaurants and an Irish pub. Across the street, in the park named
for deli founder Abe Lebenthol, stands St. Mark's in the Bowery
Church, a crucible of politics and culture in the '60s where Pete
Seeger sang, Allen Ginsberg read his poems and Sam Shepard mounted
his earliest plays.
</P>
<P>
   I got middling service during a hectic lunch hour, but this was
nothing new. Deli waitpersons tend to be grumpy even by Gotham
standards. Combination sandwiches and entrees tend to be in the
$10-$20 range.
</P>
<P>
   As in all the great delis, there are amusing photos of
celebrities. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is pictured wagging a salami
like a baseball bat. I stared at the Dustin Hoffman photo,
pondering the actor's cryptic message to the management: ``Your
heart is as big as your liver!''
</P>
<P>
   To Rosenbaum's favorites, I would add the divine apple strudel.
</P>
<P>
   156 Second Ave. (at 10th Street), 212-677-0606.
</P>
<P>
   B A R N E Y G R E E N G R A S S (T H E S T U R G E O N K I N G)
</P>
<P>
   It's not a physically impressive place _ in fact the dining
room, with its inexplicable, bogus-looking mural of old New
Orleans, is downright drab. But if you have a certain taste in deli
this upper West Side place looks like the Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supreme for smoked fish,'' declares Rosenbaum. ``The Nova
lox is a beautiful experience. Don't just ask for lox or what
you'll get is too salty. And the sable is spectacular.'' Also on
the menu are platters of sturgeon, kippered salmon and whitefish.
They're all pricey ($16-$31.50) but can easily fill up two people
with their extras of two bagels or bialys, potato salad or cole
slaw and salad-type fixings.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the non-fish items are cheaper than at the
other big-name delis. There are triple-decker sandwiches under $10,
including one (for hard-core deli fans) with roast beef, turkey and
chicken fat. (I passed on that particular delicacy).
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum wasn't exaggerating about the chopped liver. Creamy
and velvety, with large chunks of crisp onion and egg white, the
heavenly stuff somehow holds a hint of sweetness below its smoky
savor. The $6.25 appetizer portion, almost meal-sized, is such a
deal, as they say.
</P>
<P>
   The charming takeout store, with its high ceiling and
checkerboard floor tile, looks much as it must have when it opened
in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   541 Amsterdam Ave. (at 86th Street), 212-724-4707.
</P>
<P>
   C A R N E G I E D E L I
</P>
<P>
   A veritable palisade of salamis hanging across the display
window hints at the scrumptious noshing to be found inside this
boisterous New York landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The decor is nothing special _ what passed for ``modern'' in the
1950s _ but the walls are packed with signed photos of legions of
celebs (Woody Allen, Barry Manilow, Rosie O'Donnell). The waiters
are brusque, and with good reason: There are almost always hungry
people jammed in the doorway ready to take your seat. Rosenbaum
says the place is becoming a tourist trap, but remember, he's a
purist.
</P>
<P>
   Don't panic at the prices of those ``Gargantuan Combo''
sandwiches ($11.45 for chicken salad and egg to $19.45 for Nova
salmon and sturgeon), for they contain two entrees' worth of food.
If you can eat more than half a G-combo at a sitting, you're a sumo
wrestler. For the rest of us, there's nothing like wrapping up half
a G-combo for a late-night snack in the hotel room (I recommend the
Brisketball: beef brisket, turkey, onion and fixings).
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times once rated Carnegie's blintzes tops in the
city, served in the ``Great White Way'' (with apple sauce and sour
cream).
</P>
<P>
   854 Seventh Ave. (at West 55th Street), 212-
</P>
<P>
   757-2245.
</P>
<P>
   S T A G E D E L I
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom about the Stage is that it's the
Carnegie wannabe, the slicked-up cousin to the more famous noshery
a block north. But I've always enjoyed the sandwiches here and
generally have some combination of pastrami, brisket, corned beef
and turkey (there's also tongue). Dr. Brown's sodas, for some
reason, are the official drink of delidom, and I always seem to
have a bottle of the Cel-Ray whenever I visit the Stage (yes, it
does taste like celery but it's also sweet and good).
</P>
<P>
   Once again, hard-sell Rosenbaum says the Stage is a borderline
tourist trap, and like the Carnegie does a booming business because
it's so convenient to the theater district. Still, I had a
delightful pastrami omelet ($11.95), crispy around the edges,
tender and moist in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Stage is set up for people-watching, with a beer-and-wine
bar in the center of the room, cheery checkerboard tile floor and
glassed-in greenhouse seating on the sidewalk. Broadway posters
include ``The Last Night of Ballyhoo'' (by Atlanta's own Alfred
Uhry) and ``Hello, Dolly!'' signed, with four giant ``X'' kisses,
by Carol Channing, probably one of the few people who can actually
wrap her mouth around the towering combo sandwiches
($13.95-$17.95).
</P>
<P>
   The dessert case is a house of decadence, stuffed with partially
ravaged pineapple, blueberry and cherry cheesecakes.

 &HT;    A SPACE AWAITS AN EMBASSY, BUT JERUSALEM IS STILL A
CONTROVERSIAL CAPITAL

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Someday, the U.S. embassy to Israel could be moved
from Tel Aviv to an awaiting vacant lot on a busy Jerusalem street.
But, before that happens, the diplomats will have to clear away a
lot more than the pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   Like so much other land here, the Israelis gained control of the
rocky slope after Arab states attacked them in 1948. But, a
Palestinian still holds the old deeds and his old dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that it might be forever lost to a U.S. embassy, he
leased it three years ago for just $1 to a famous tenant _ Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot keep it and protect like he can,'' said Ali Fitiani,
a wealthy Palestinian businessman. ``If the Americans build an
embassy there, they will be getting the land from the Israelis, but
(the Israelis) do not own it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitiani's deeds have little practical value, as the land is
firmly under Israeli control. But, they are a pointed reminder of
the underlying dispute over the 5,000-year-old city. The dispute
has made this the only place on earth where the United States,
along with most other countries, keeps its embassy outside the
declared capital of the host country.
</P>
<P>
   That policy is now coming under increased scrutiny and faces a
deadline soon. Back in 1995, a pro-Israel U.S. Congress passed the
``Jerusalem Embassy Act,'' which recognized Jerusalem as Israel's
capital and ordered that, by June 1999, the U.S. Embassy be moved
there from Tel Aviv, about 35 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton will likely fend off the mandate,
exercising a ``national security'' waiver that would delay the
embassy move but face congressional criticism.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials often meet Israeli leaders in Jerusalem,
treating it as a de facto capital, administration officials see an
embassy move as too inflammatory a gesture. Amid the troubled
Palestinian-Israeli Oslo peace process, such matters of real estate
quickly become battles over sacred homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Riots against Israeli troops erupted in the Palestinian West
Bank in 1997 when the U.S. Congress earmarked $100 million for an
embassy move. Faisal Husseini, Palestine Liberation Organization
leader for Jerusalem, said riots would break out again ``for sure''
if the embassy were moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not in the United States' interests to take a step that
would have clear negative repercussions for the negotiations on
peace and security between the Israelis and Palestinians,'' said
U.S. Embassy Spokesman Larry Schwartz. As of last week,
administration officials said they had not decided whether to
exercise the waiver allowed in the embassy law.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., sponsored the Jerusalem Embassy
Act and wants Clinton to make the move. He notes that the land is
in predominantly Jewish West Jerusalem -- albeit on the very edge
-- and not in the more controversial Arab areas captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels that this is land that no one can argue will fall
under Palestinian jurisdiction and the (peace) negotiations, to
that extent, are irrelevant,'' said Lieberman's press secretary Dan
Gerstein. He adds that threats of violence should not control U.S.
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But, as administration officials point out, the Oslo accords
make no distinction between east and west. They just state that
Jerusalem is at issue and an embassy move would therefore
short-circuit the agreement, which was signed by Israel, the
Palestinians and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, U.S. policy toward Jerusalem is often
contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   One one hand, Congress recognized it as the capital.
Administration officials routinely meet Israeli leaders there.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, official policy leaves the city's status
pending.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the child of an American is born in Tel Aviv,
the baby's U.S. passport lists the birthplace as ``Tel Aviv,
Israel.'' But, an American baby born in Jerusalem will get a U.S.
passport that states just ``Jerusalem,'' followed by a blank space
-- as if the city belongs to no country at all.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Such ambivalence is nearly worldwide. To the consternation of
the Israelis, who base their government in Jerusalem, only Costa
Rica and El Salvador keep embassies here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this rather absurd situation in which all the
government activity is in Jerusalem but all the embassies are in
Tel Aviv,'' says David Bar-Illan, adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. ``This is discriminatory, and an absurd and
politically loaded snubbing of our capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel solidified it's hold on the western portion of the city
in the 1948 war. In 1967, it captured the rest of the city,
including the Arab areas and Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy
sites in the walled Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli leaders -- especially at election time -- frequently
pledge to keep Jerusalem their ``eternal, undivided, capital.''
</P>
<P>
   After a row with European officials last week over the status of
the city -- the European Union considers Jerusalem an international
city -- Israeli officials angrily called for a world-wide public
relations campaign to explain why Jerusalem is their capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis with Europe made us realize that many things we
take for granted here are not taken for granted elsewhere,''
Bar-Illan said.

NATIONAL GALLERY GETS SCULPTURES  
 ART FOR BEACON, N.Y.  
 PHOTOS IN BROOKLYN  
 A 20-CENTURY FAIR?

   NEW YORK _ Nearly two years ago the National Gallery of Art in
Washington broke ground on a $12 million sculpture garden, on six
acres adjacent to its West Building on the Mall. At the time, there
were about 12 outdoor sculptures in the permanent collection, and
museum officials said that they were planning to double that
number.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Earl A. Powell III, director of the gallery, said it
had acquired 10 major sculptures in time for the garden's opening
on May 23.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptors represented include Louise Bourgeois, Mark di
Suvero, Roy Lichtenstein, Tony Smith, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje
van Bruggen, Ellsworth Kelly and Magdalena Abakanowicz. Seven of
the new acquisitions were donated by the Morris and Gwendolyn
Cafritz Foundation, which also underwrote the garden itself. The
other three works _ by Barry Flanagan, Sol LeWitt and Lucas Samaras
_ were given by individual donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the artists whose outdoor pieces we've acquired are
new to the National Gallery,'' Powell said, noting that until now
the Gallery has had no works by either Flanagan or Ms. Abakanowicz.
</P>
<P>
   The garden was designed by Laurie D. Olin, a Philadelphia-based
landscape architect, in collaboration with the National Gallery
staff. It includes a reflecting pool, with a fountain in its
center, that will be transformed into an ice-skating rink in
winter. There are also walks and seating areas, as well as a
renovated pavilion that will have a cafe.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1991 the National Park Service and the National
Gallery signed an agreement, which was approved by the National
Capital Planning Commission, transferring jurisdiction of the
sculpture garden site from the Park Service to the National
Gallery. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barely a week after the Dia Center for the Arts said it would
open a large branch in an abandoned factory in the Hudson River
town of Beacon, it has announced the acquisition of a seminal
series of 15 plywood floor pieces by Donald Judd, which it plans to
display in its new space.
</P>
<P>
   Dia, based in Chelsea, owned these floor pieces once before.
They were made in 1976 and exhibited the next year at the Heiner
Friedrich Gallery, which was then in SoHo. Friedrich bought them
and then donated them to Dia, which he had founded with his wife,
Phillipa de Menil, in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The floor pieces were among the extensive holdings of Judd's
work that in 1986 Dia gave to the Chinati Foundation, the museum in
Marfa, Texas, that Judd created for the permanent installation of
large-scale contemporary art. The artist died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A provision of the gift was that it could be sold to benefit the
foundation. Thirteen years later, that is exactly what has
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Chinati needed to raise money to establish an endowment fund,
and so Dia was able to buy back the floor pieces with a $1.9
million grant from the Houston-based Brown Foundation. Proceeds
will establish a fund for the operations of the Chinati Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The work is a series of 15 variations on a box, three feet tall
and five feet wide, made from five-eights-inch-thick sheets of
plywood. It became a prototype for Judd's 100-mill aluminum pieces,
commissioned by Dia as the focal point of Judd's permanent
installation in the converted Army camp in Marfa where the Chinati
Foundation is based. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gaping hole not to have an important work by Judd in
our collection,'' said Michael Govan, director of Dia, who was
quick to explain that the acquisition was not an attempt to ``just
fill the new museum with works.'' Rather, he said, it is a purchase
``very targeted to re-enforce Dia's strength _ artists who emerged
in the 1960s and 1970s.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trying to vary its exhibitions to attract different audiences,
the Brooklyn Museum of Art has scheduled a show of installations
and photographs by Mariko Mori, the Japanese photographer and
performance artist. ``Mariko Mori: Empty Dream'' will open on April
8 and run through Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The show will be an adaptation of several recent exhibitions.
Within the last year, large shows of Ms. Mori's work have been held
at the Serpentine Gallery in London, the Museum of Contemporary Art
in Chicago, the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh and the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art. Brooklyn's version is being organized
by Charlotta Kotik, its curator of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   The show will fill a gap in the museum's schedule. Originally
``From Hip to Hop: Black Fashion and a Culture of Influence'' was
to have opened on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been able to answer all the questions that were
raised once we started working on it,'' said Arnold Lehman,
director of the Brooklyn Museum, explaining the postponement. A new
date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman decided to pursue the Mori exhibition after seeing her
work in Chicago. ``I think it will have an important effect on
collectors, artists and young people who have not had the
opportunity of seeing her work here,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dealers who specialize in 20th-century art and design may have a
new Manhattan venue. Anna and Brian Haughton, who first shook up
the art-fair circuit 10 years ago by organizing the International
Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show, are hoping to announce a new
fair.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based couple plan to introduce an International
20th-Century Art and Design Show over Thanksgiving weekend. It will
be at the Seventh Regiment Armory, joining the three fairs the
Haughtons already hold there: the International Fine Art and
Antique Dealer's Show every September, the six-year-old
International Fine Art Fair each May and the International Asian
Art Fair, which opens Thursday for its fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   The Thanksgiving date is no accident. It was planned to coincide
with the 20th-century decorative-art auctions that are generally
held at Sotheby's and Christie's around that time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Magda Grigorian, a spokeswoman for the Haughtons, confirmed that
such a show is under discussion but declined to comment further.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The closing of ``Band in Berlin'' at the Helen Hayes
this weekend has set off rampant speculation about the next tenant
at the theater, Broadway's smallest.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the talk centered on ``By Jeeves,'' the Andrew Lloyd
Webber/Alan Ayckbourn musical. Its producer, the Goodspeed Opera
House, made a frantic push this week to open by April 28, in time
for the deadline for Tony nominations. Michael Price, the executive
director of the Goodspeed, said the theater was committed, actors
had been put on call, the $1.2 million budget was ready and Lord
Lloyd Webber had signed off on the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, after a day of calls, Price said Ayckbourn's
schedule would not allow enough time to rehearse and open the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Alan, we just can't do it,'' he said. ``My adrenaline
has been going so high, but it's not going to happen. But it will
happen eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   With a small field of new musicals eligible for Tonys, the logic
was that ``By Jeeves'' might have done well, Price said. It was not
to be.
</P>
<P>
   After rumors arose about ``Wit,'' its producers released a
statement denying that there had been an offer from the theater's
owner, Martin Markinson, and saying that they were quite happy at
the Union Square Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway wags also had ``Night Must Fall,'' which closes at the
Lyceum on April 11, in the running. But Gary Springer, a spokesman
for the show, said that Matthew Broderick, the star, was committed
to a show at Hartford Stage in May.
</P>
<P>
   Too Many Good Shows?
</P>
<P>
   While most of the season's straight plays are doing nicely on
Broadway, several of the best reviewed off-Broadway entries have
been fighting for audiences.
</P>
<P>
   At the Century Center, for example, ``Snakebit,'' a light drama
about three friends and a secret affair, has recovered from some
abysmal preview weeks to gross $43,852 last week. Still, that is
only $4,000 above the break-even mark, said Roy Gabay, the show's
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking even is also the norm at the Douglas Fairbanks, where
Kenneth Lonergan's comedy ``This Is Our Youth'' is staged. Eric
Krebs, the theater's owner and the play's co-producer, said the
weekly gross had recently built to around $30,000, which is
slightly less than its weekly costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful Thing,'' a love story about two teen-age boys,
started out strong but has sagged in recent weeks. Gabay, the
show's producer, said that the gross two weeks ago, $22,000, was
his first weekly loss but that last week was better. The show's
running cost is about $33,000.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the strongest entry is ``The Most Fabulous Story Ever
Told,'' which has been making a small if steady weekly profit at
the Minetta Lane Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been building,'' said Richard Frankel, a producer, of
the gross. He declined to give the exact amount, but one person who
had seen the figures estimated the average at $80,000, or some
$20,000 above operating costs. The recent addition of the actress
Lea DeLaria and the comic Julie Halston has also improved business,
Frankel said.
</P>
<P>
   The producers say the surfeit of quality shows may be to blame.
``We're all going after the same audience,'' said Gabay. ``And
there's a lot of product out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lamb to Bow Out
</P>
<P>
   Times Square may soon be losing another theater. The Manhattan
Church of the Nazarene, which owns the Lambs Theater on West 44th
Street, is in negotiations with the Hampshire Hotels and Resorts
chain to turn its building into a hotel, church officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Calhoun, the church's pastor, said that the plans
called for a 108-room hotel and that the building's 349-seat
off-Broadway theater would be demolished, although the facade of
the building, a historic landmark designed by Stanford White, would
be preserved, as would a small church theater space. Calhoun said
the deal depended on approval by the city's Landmarks Commission
and that it was necessary to the church's fiscal well-being. Calls
to Hampshire Hotels were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The 1904 building was long the home of the Lambs Club, a
theatrical social club whose members included Irving Berlin, Fred
Astaire and John Wayne. Legend has it that Alan Jay Lerner met
Frederick Loewe at the club, and that the duo composed their 1947
musical ``Brigadoon'' there. Carolyn Rossi Copeland, a producer
with a long history at the Lamb's Theater, said she and her
husband, the architect James Copeland, would try to save some of
the building's interior woodwork and marble fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   A Cue From Mom
</P>
<P>
   As Kristine Nielsen will tell you, being a cast member of
``Betty's Summer Vacation'' isn't always easy. Besides the general
strain of playing a broad comedy eight times a week, the play's
subject matter _ media, molestation and masculine mutilation _
hasn't sat well with some audience members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are nights where it is very quiet out there,'' said Ms.
Nielsen, in typically seriocomic style. Often, though, those
moments are broken by laughter and it is Ms. Nielsen the audience
has to thank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betty's Summer Vacation,'' by Christopher Durang, opened on
Sunday to good reviews, with many critics citing Ms. Nielsen's
portrayal of Mrs. Siezmagraff, the cheerfully unhinged hostess of a
cursed summer share, as one of the year's funniest.
</P>
<P>
   The show has since been extended by two weeks. Several producers
are considering reopening elsewhere, though the show may take a
hiatus after closing on April 11.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nielsen, a veteran of the regional theater circuit, met
Durang in 1989, during a production of ``Ubu'' at Lincoln Center
Theater. ``We were known backstage as the town gossips,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The two remained close, and last year, when Durang was finishing
``Summer Vacation,'' he began to write the role of Ms. Siezmagraff
specifically for Ms. Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   The actress, who grew up in Washington, said she modeled her
performance on another Nielsen. ``My mother would kill me, but I
think I used her as a starting point,'' she said. ``She has that
Southern charm and civility, and very positive energy.'' She added,
``I've just made it a little misguided.''

ALIENS AHEAD: NOT CUTE OR CUDDLY LIKE E.T. 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are so many things to learn about the coming alien
invasion. First, stay away from exclusive, secret downtown clubs in
New York: everybody there is a space alien inhabiting a genetic
duplicate of a human body. If you find yourself there anyway, do
not let anyone nuzzle your ear, especially someone who might be
hiding a worm in his or her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   This is how they infect you, downloading your DNA and your
memories to make a duplicate of you. The only known solution is to
drink blue agave tequila, which makes the worm leave your body.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not making this up. Writers for ``First Wave'' did.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Wave'' is one of two new hourlong series the Sci-Fi
Channel is introducing Friday night. One show wants to be the new
``X-Files''; the other, the new ``Star Trek.'' Both are a long way
from their goals but they have potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Wave'' was, in fact, created by a former ``X-Files''
writer, Chris Brancato. Its Fox Mulder equivalent is Cade Foster
(Sebastian Spence), a cocky young security-system salesman with a
beautiful wife, a nice house and a fabulous life.
</P>
<P>
   But in the premiere, he begins having strange hallucinations,
loses his job, suddenly has a zero balance at the ATM, finds his
house broken into with the number 19 painted in red on the walls,
meets a seemingly insane prisoner who commits suicide, digs up a
centuries-old book of Nostradamus' predictions, discovers an alien
invasion, is committed to a psychiatric hospital, is framed (by
aliens) for the murder of his wife and goes on the run, making him
a Dr. Richard Kimble equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Wave'' is a little earnest, but maybe a line like Cade's
``Someone's out to tear our lives apart'' isn't unreasonable under
the circumstances. Spence, who played the adult Kevin (the sexually
abused central character) in ``The Boys of St. Vincent,'' is
appealing, and it looks as if he'll be getting into interesting
situations: aliens go into group therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Aliens try to undermine the institution of family to destroy
society. Aliens distribute an elixir of youth. And, of course, the
tequila and worm episode.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can only hope that Cade's initial discovery of the
invasion doesn't represent the credibility level of the series as a
whole. Why would aliens line the walls of their headquarters with
black-and-white 8-by-10 photographs of their victims?
</P>
<P>
   ``First Wave'' has its ``X-Files'' connection and Francis Ford
Coppola as an executive producer. ``Farscape'' has the Jim Henson
Co. So when its hero, John Crichton (Ben Browder, who looks a
little like Paul LeMat in ``American Graffiti''), a
second-generation American astronaut, accidentally goes through a
worm hole during a shuttle mission and ends up in another galaxy
several of his new colleagues are Muppets.
</P>
<P>
   These, of course, are Henson's more intimidating, not so cuddly
Muppets. Rygel XVI, for instance, may be 26 inches tall and shaped
sort of like the Liberty Bell but as a former sovereign who has
been a prisoner for 250 years he's pretty grouchy and not likely to
burst into heartwarming song.
</P>
<P>
   Crichton's other new comrades on the biomechanoid spaceship Moya
include Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black), an imprisoned Peacekeeper who
looks human; General Ka D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe), Lexan warrior and
Chewbacca the Wookiee look-alike, and Zhaan (Virginia Hey), a
spiritual leader with blue skin.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since the ``Star Wars'' bar scene.
Television now seems crowded with so many alien species with
meaningful cultural characteristics that we hardly need any new
ones, but ``Farscape'' has its pluses.
</P>
<P>
   In the premiere, Crichton leaves behind the vast silence and
solitude of Earth space and emerges from the wormhole into a
section of outer space that looks like a ``Star Wars'' battle
scene.
</P>
<P>
   There is humor. (``Don't move! Or I'll fill you with _ little
bolts of golden light,'' says Crichton. And when Aeryn asks him
what she could possibly need him for, he waits until she walks away
and mutters: ``Talent. Personality. Stock tips.'') And there are
welcome original ``Star Trek''-style paradoxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Peacekeepers, for instance, are the particular brutal
soldiers. And in the show's third episode, the Moya crew learns a
valuable lesson when it makes the assumption that having giant
space cockroaches aboard is bad. &QL;

 DaMARCUS BEASLEY, 16, SIGNS PRO CONTRACT WITH MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER  
(rk) 
 By BRIAN EVERS McGEE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ In the same week he was named the top
midfielder on the Parade Magazine All-American team, DaMarcus
Beasley became the youngest player ever to sign a Major League
Soccer contract.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley signed with U.S. Project-40, an MLS development program,
on Wednesday. Beasley, 16 years, 10 months of age, will train with
MLS clubs this summer to help prepare him for the professional
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley, a junior at Bradenton Academy, will not see action in
MLS matches this season. He will train and play games with U.S.
Pro-40 under coach Lothar Osiander when Under-17 national team
duties do not conflict with the Pro-40 team's A-League schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a dream of mine, to play a pro sport since I was
a child, Beasley said. ``And now, to be a pro, it's an exciting
time for me. My option was college but I spoke to my parents, I
talked to coaches, friends and everyone was 100 percent behind me
whatever I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Beasley said the contract includes $24,000, to be paid in $2,000
monthly installments, $2,500 from Nike and $1,500 in merchandise
from Nike plus bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Project-40 is a joint venture between MLS and U.S. Soccer aimed
at providing America's young talent a chance to compete with the
top countries in the 2000 Olympics and 2010 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley will be assigned to a MLS squad and will report
following his graduation from Bradenton Academy in the spring of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``DaMarcus Beasley is the youngest player to ever sign a MLS
contract,'' said Ivan Gazidis, MLS executive vice president of
player relations and operations. ``He can be thought of as a
prototype for the young American soccer player developing on our
soil. We are delighted that DeMarcus has chosen to progress his
talent in MLS.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the U-17 national team, Beasley scored 17 goals and
collected 16 assists during the last two years as the team prepared
to qualify for FIFA's World Youth Championships set for Nov. 10.
His nine goals in 1998 were tied for second on the club.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-7-inch, 126-pound Beasley scored three second-half
goals in the Florida High School fall state soccer championships to
lead the Blazers to the state title. Beasley is part of the U-17
national team residential program at the Bollettieri Sports Academy
in Bradenton.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Wayne, Ind., native is following in the footsteps of
his older brother, Jamar, who went from Project-40 to the New
England Revolution.

MASTOIANNI'S LAST FILM A TRIP DOWN ROAD OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This prophetically sad film by 91-year-old director Manoel De
Oliveira was Marcello Mastroianni's 171st _ and final _ movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voyage to the Beginning of the World'' is a meditative,
reflective journey through the past.
</P>
<P>
   Like many films that are personal reflections and laments to
passing time, the infirmity of old age and the presence of ghostly
memories, it's truly only interesting for the people involved
despite its universality.
</P>
<P>
   In a van traveling through northern Portugal, four riders
discuss age, youth and the barriers that they present. Manoel
(Mastroianni) is a film director. His companions are Afonso (Jean
Yves Gautier), a French actor born in Portugal who is starring in
Manoel's latest venture; Judite (Leonor Silveira), a vibrant, young
actress, and Duarte (Diogo Doria), the driver who acts as tour
guide.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Manoel reminisces about his early life in Portugal.
He remembers many of the things he now misses _ especially the
women. Everyone has also agreed to help Afonso find his father's
village and what is left of a family he's never known. The meeting
will bring ultimate acceptance and a discovery that will help one
man's life begin as another's approaches twilight.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense of circular motion and completion to De
Oliveira's contemplative missive. Like the wonderful French film,
``A Sunday in the Country,'' the sense of family, love and creative
purpose is a redeeming factor.
</P>
<P>
   But De Oliveira's vision is more circumspect and may not
translate well for all viewers. It's slow going for a while and
there is a shadow cast over the first half _ mostly because
Mastroianni is so visibly frail. He died in 1996, a year before the
film's release. But the film picks up as it becomes a redemptive
story about belonging and creative pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Death and memory are two things nobody can avoid. And as the car
zooms away from the camera in scene after scene and the lines in
the road blur, we're left with a sense of our own fragility and
mortality.

UNDERESTIMATE POE'S LEGACY? NEVERMORE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  Michael Frank is a book critic, essayist and short-story writer. 
 By MICHAEL FRANK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reviewing the life and career of Edgar Allan Poe can
be a hall-of-mirrors-like experience. There are as many Poes, it
seems, as there are people to make, calumniate and rehabilitate his
reputation, with some observers doing double duty as both foe and
friend.
</P>
<P>
   There is Poe the hybrid of genius and charlatan whose literary
criticism was ``the most complete and exquisite specimen of
provincialism ever prepared for the edification of men'' (Henry
James). There is Poe who possesses ``the intellect of a highly
gifted young person before puberty'' yet whose ``variety and
ardor'' of curiosity nevertheless ``delight and dazzle'' (T.S.
Eliot). There is Poe who ``endows imagination with Godlike power''
and ``anticipates the special hell of modern man'' (Allen Tate by
way of Daniel Hoffman).
</P>
<P>
   There is Poe the poet, Poe the pauper, Poe the mourner, Poe the
alcoholic. There is Poe the working writer (less generously
referred to as hack) and frequent magazine contributor, and there
is Poe the inventor of the detective story and the science-fiction
tale and tales of ratiocination. There is the Poe who applied
himself to graphology, ciphers, cryptograms, puzzles, labyrinths
and mesmerism. There is Poe who quarreled with editors and
colleagues, made friends of his enemies and enemies of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing up the actual man from the erosive, turbulent sea that
has been Poe's particularly ill-fated mixture of life and legend is
no easy task, but it is one that, in a modest way, the Pierpont
Morgan Library has set about doing with ``Poe: The Ardent
Imagination,'' an exhibition mounted in commemoration of the 150th
anniversary of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Allan Poe had one of the most unfortunate executorial
experiences in the history of American letters. He entrusted his
posthumous opus to the Rev. Rufus W. Griswold, whose blackening of
Poe demonstrated ``a sustained hatred,'' as Auden once put it.
Auden characterized Griswold's treatment of Poe as subtle, but it's
hard to see much that is subtle in a man who, albeit after praising
Poe as a skilled writer of faultless taste, maligned him as
erratic, unprincipled and immoral; portrayed him flailing his arms
and speaking to spirits; falsified letters to ``prove'' his
treachery to his friends; alleged that he had deserted the Army and
had been expelled from a university, and intimated that he was the
lover of his mother-in-law, who was also, as it happens, his aunt.
</P>
<P>
   It is little wonder that upon Poe's death a representative
obituary (in The New York Daily Tribune) described him as ``pale
even to ghastliness'' and reported that his heart was ``gnawed with
anguish'' and his face ``shrouded in gloom,'' thereby helping to
inaugurate the mythic, tortured Poe whom Christine Nelson, the
curator of the exhibition, seeks to rein in with her presentation
of manuscripts and memorabilia drawn entirely from the Morgan's
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nelson follows in the path of other rescuers of Poe, notably
Arthur Hobson Quinn, who exposed Griswold's libel; Kenneth
Silverman, who is the author of a superb recent biography, ``Edgar
A. Poe: Mournful and Never-Ending Remembrance,'' and the poet
Daniel Hoffman, whose eccentric ``Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe'' joins
in a jazzed, delirious dance with the man and his work. Ms.
Nelson's goal, she said, was ``to look at Poe's importance in his
own time, when he was a vibrant critic, a vocal magazine writer and
a beloved teller of tales.'' She was less interested in Poe the
tragic hero.
</P>
<P>
   This Poe, it turns out, is not substantially represented in the
Morgan holdings, which helps Ms. Nelson emphasize the productive
over the pained Poe, but the latter does makes an appearance here
nonetheless, in sections titled ``Love and Death'' and ``Personal
Suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Loss is one of the great unavoidable themes of Poe's life and
work. Both of his parents were actors; his father, who drank,
abandoned the family, while his mother died of consumption when Poe
was a small boy. Separated from his brother and sister, Poe was
raised by a foster mother, who also died of consumption, and a
foster father, who cruelly rejected the emerging young writer. Loss
came again with the early death of Poe's wife, Virginia, who was
Poe's first cousin and 13 years old when he married her. At 25 she,
too, died of consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all melancholy topics, what, according to the universal
understanding of mankind, is the most melancholy?'' Poe once
famously asked himself. Death was the reply. When is this most
melancholy of topics most poetical? ``When it most closely allies
itself to Beauty: the death, then, of a beautiful woman is,
unquestionably, the most poetical topic in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In support of this ``most poetical'' topic, we see an autograph
manuscript of ``Tamerlane,'' the title poem in Poe's first book,
which presents the Tartar conqueror's deathbed recollections of
young love. Nearby are fair copies of ``Ulalume'' and ``Annabel
Lee,'' two further examples of Poe's death-of-a-beautiful-woman
poems. ``Ulalume'' is accompanied by an interesting letter to Susan
Ingram, who had heard Poe recite the poem in Virginia in September
1849, a month before his death. She asked him to interpret the
obtuse verse; he replied with a handsomely penned copy of the poem
and a letter gently refusing the task: ``I remember Dr. Johnson's
bitter and rather just remarks about the folly of explaining what,
if worth explanation, should explain itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in this century, in her advanced old age, Ingram visited
J.P. Morgan, who had bought the manuscript from her in 1906, and
asked to see it one more time before she died. Thus at least one
woman, though no longer young and perhaps not still beautiful,
survived to remember Poe and remain attached to him long after he
himself had turned to dust.
</P>
<P>
   The living Poe had some palpably hard times, to be sure. He was
a ``victim of melancholy,'' says a letter from his employer at The
Southern Literary Messenger, where Poe was an editor. He drank, as
his father did, but frequently renounced alcohol. In this sad
letter to George Eveleth, a medical student admirer, Poe wrote in
February 1848: ``The causes which maddened me to the drinking point
are no more, and I am done drinking, forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas he was not. Later that spring he was observed there by
another editor ``in a debauch.'' ``No influence was adequate to
keep him from the damnable propensity to drink,'' that editor
remarks in a Morgan letter. ``He spoke of himself as the victim of
a preordained damnation, as l'ame perdue.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were many periods in his life when Poe's soul was
found and redeemed and when his mind crackled with invention and
rigorous (if occasionally loopy) thinking, as case after case at
the Morgan attests. A career as fertile and varied as Poe's time
and again vanquishes the damnable propensity to (actually, of
course, the illness of) drink.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his notes, for example, for a proposed book about the
American literary scene. With many deletions and corrections Poe
works up ``some honest opinions'' on the subject. He comes out
against the kind of cliquerie represented by the Transcendentalists
(``perhaps the worst feature we have'') and in favor of
establishing international copyright law. He rails against the
depreciation of Southern and Western talent, ``which upon the whole
is greater, more vivid, fresher, than that of the North.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Poe was not all prickles and burrs and barbs. He was the author
of the wildly popular ``Raven,'' which, interestingly, made an
early appearance on the back page of a newspaper, embedded among
ads for pens, Turkish pipe bowls and Southern Balm, ``The Great
American Remedy.'' More reverential treatment came in time:
translations by Mallarme (who, along with Baudelaire, was among the
French writers greatly influenced by Poe); illustrations by Manet,
Gustave Dore and even Matisse; bindings tooled and gilded like
jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Poe was also a pioneer of the short story, in which he believed
a certain unique or single effect should be wrought out _ and was,
by him, in several genres that he virtually created, detective and
science fiction among them. The Morgan displays a rare pamphlet
copy of ``The Murders in the Rue Morgue,'' stained with brown spots
like drops of blood. Nearby is ``The Tell-Tale Heart,'' which first
appeared in James Russell Lowell's short-lived magazine The
Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging by itself, like a hallowed scroll, is ``A Tale of the
Ragged Mountains,'' one of several exceedingly curious autograph
manuscripts Poe produced for reasons unknown to Ms. Nelson. In his
clearest and most crisp adult hand, he wrote out the story on
narrow sheets of paper, then joined them together with sealing wax
into a long roll that resembles a mummy's bandage or toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   Poe was a vigorous, disciplined, driven fellow, hard-working,
not above taking mundane jobs for money, a tale spinner and
sentence weaver to the marrow. He loved, lost, drank, ached and
mourned and struggled with a psyche of much complexity. These two
Poes, two of dozens to be sure, hover like specters over the glass
cases in the exhibition. But, perhaps ineluctably, none is as
haunting as the daguerreotyped Poe, whose likeness was taken in
Providence in 1848, four days after he attempted suicide the year
before his death.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the finely scored surface, a baggy-eyed, heavy-browed,
marble-skinned Poe shimmers in silvery enigmatic silence. He had
come to Providence to persuade a woman, a fellow writer, Sarah
Helen Whitman, to marry him. He had promised to abstain from drink
but had broken his pledge and lost his love. Whitman ``bade him
farewell,'' she wrote, ``with feelings of profound commiseration
for his fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending a visit to the Morgan on this note would affirm the
turbulent, troubled Poe. But this man, intricate in courtship as in
his other human relations, remains his fierce, slippery,
paradoxical self. ``From this day forth I shun the pestilential
society of literary women,'' he wrote a friend. ``They are a
heartless, unnatural, venomous, dishonorable set.'' He added, ``How
great a burden is taken off my heart by my rupture with Mrs. W.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Allan Poe died on Oct. 7, 1849. ``Lord help my poor soul''
were the last words he spoke.

NO STARRING ROLE FOR AGENTS  
 JUST BEING NEIGHBORLY  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Once a year on Oscar night, and only then, toute
Hollywood turns out to celebrate the industry's accomplishments, to
share a bit of movie glamour at an event in which everyone is
included. Well, almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The coveted Oscars are voted upon by the members of the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Though the group's roster is
secret, its executives admit to having about 5,500 members in 13
branches, including everyone from actors, directors, public
relations officials and studio executives to musicians, art
directors and agents.
</P>
<P>
   As George Orwell might have put it, all academy members are
equal, but some are more equal than others. And that is never felt
more keenly and bitterly than at Oscar season, when agents are
reminded that they are the only major branch of the academy that is
excluded from voting.
</P>
<P>
   This is because the academy is a relic from a bygone era in
which the big studios held sway over the industry. Agents were on
the fringes in the prewar days when the academy was organized, but
today they are among the most influential players in piecing
together film projects. Many studio executives and producers were
once agents.
</P>
<P>
   Their lack of voting rights is an anomaly that pleases no one.
The ostensible reason for their status is that agents are advocates
for their clients and would thus be biased voters. In addition,
they are said to be peripheral to filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   But the agents reply that nearly everyone in the academy is
motivated by some self-interest. Most notably, there is the public
relations branch, made up of people who promote, spin and
glamourize movies and stars but have no hand in film production.
</P>
<P>
   The 350 or so public relations officials in the academy vote, so
why not the 65 or so agents?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone you talk to says: `I can't believe you can't vote.
How can that happen?' '' said Martha Luttrell, an agent at
International Creative Management who heads the agents' branch of
the academy. ``We have been fighting for the vote for years now
with great frustration. We always talk to a board member who says
this year people will come to their senses. It never happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy wrestles with this fact occasionally, but always
maintains the status quo and the old-fashioned rationale behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is agents make deals rather than movies,'' said
Bruce Davis, executive director of the academy. ``I know what
people say about the PR branch. There may be a logical
inconsistency there. But if an error was made in giving them a vote
in the past it's not going to be fixed by making an error in the
present.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the agents raise the issue frequently, Davis added, ``the
idea has not been embraced even mildly by the board.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has suggested taking the vote away from the publicists,
but members of the public relations branch chafe at the notion of
allowing agents to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of think of them as the management for individuals as
opposed to overseeing an entire film,'' said Cheryl Boone Isaacs,
the head of marketing at New Line Cinema and a former head of the
public relations branch of the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Angelotti, who heads his own publicity agency and is on the
academy committee that admits new members to his branch, said:
``The historical perception is the agents are advocates and
therefore they would vote accordingly. I don't think the PR people
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Luttrell said that the idea that any branch would be more
fair than another was nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   The voting process is secretive and is also the subject of
debate. The academy's voting members can make nominations only in
the categories involving their own branches of expertise, except in
the best picture category, in which any voting member may make a
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The five top vote-getters become the overall nominees. Voting
members then choose the winners, who are to be announced at the
extravaganza here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have complained about the intensity and cost of the
lobbying by some of the studios. The battle between ``Shakespeare
in Love'' and ``Saving Private Ryan'' this year, for example, has
been hugely expensive as well as a gimmick to attract attention to
the Academy Awards broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics also complain that the vote tallies are kept
secret. That way, it is never clear if a movie or a star won by 3
votes or 300, information that would be relevant in determining the
extent to which the academy membership reflects popular views.
</P>
<P>
   But change comes slowly at the academy, which has fended off
nearly all proposals for major shifts. The agents' complaints
usually draw little sympathy because they are famously well paid
and are seen as fee-hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lantz, a highly regarded agent who helped set up the
movie ``Amadeus,'' wrote to the academy a year and a half ago
complaining bitterly that agents were ``second-class citizens
within the academy.'' He described how he helped create
``Amadeus,'' then closed by saying, ``I urge you to end one of the
more absurd instances of discrimination in our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been all sorts of active campaigns on this,'' said
Sandy Bresler, an agent and chairman of the Association of Talent
Agents. ``But they have not met with the desired results, and I
don't know if they will.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just Being Neighborly
</P>
<P>
   So the neighbor says, ``Joe, c'mon, do this movie with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe says, ``I've kept a low profile all my life. I'm not going
to put my mug on a 40-foot screen.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor asks again and again for years. Pressed by the
neighbor's son, long-retired Joe finally says, ``Everyone at some
point in life wants to do this. OK''
</P>
<P>
   And so began Joe Viterelli's second career as an actor. The
neighbor was the television director Leo Penn, the father of Sean
Penn. The older Penn, who died in September, lived in Malibu, where
Viterelli had retired after a business career in New York that he
described vaguely as involving owning a few gin mills and a
trucking company and playing the stock market. His new career has
most recently brought him the role of Jelly in ``Analyze This,''
the year's first big hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' is a gangster film sendup in which the head of
a Mafia family, played by Robert De Niro, loses his nerve and
recruits a therapist, played by Billy Crystal, to bring back his
happy old murderous ferocity. But Jelly, the don's trusted
lieutenant, is an occasional scene stealer. He is a lovable killer
with a face like an oversized pork chop who frequently utters
malapropisms, like calling a bad headache a ``mindgraine.''
</P>
<P>
   Viterelli said the call that finally encouraged him to accept
the challenge of acting came not from his neighbor Leo, but from
Sean Penn. It was 1990, and the younger Penn was making the
gangster film ``State of Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean just told me: `I know you always said no to my dad, but I
thought I'd catch you on a whim. We're shooting this mob stuff on
Mott Street, and I know you know the area.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Viterelli grew up in Little Italy with plenty of real
gangsters. He said he always had an interest in the arts _ he plays
classical guitar, and his son, Joseph, is a well-regarded composer
of film scores _ but had to conceal that from his childhood friends
because of the tough environment. But the call from Sean Penn
brought him to New York, where he played a heavy in what became the
first of several dozen pictures; he has been in ``Bullets Over
Broadway,'' ``The Firm'' and ``Eraser.''
</P>
<P>
   Viterelli said he originally read the script for ``Analyze
This'' about three years ago and immediately fell in love with
Jelly, an old-line gangster who worries that, if his boss is seeing
a therapist, next he may turn gay. He said he was finally called to
audition in New York for two lesser roles, which was heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I'd come and read with one condition,'' Viterelli
said. ``I've been carrying this guy Jelly around with me and I have
to get him out. If you'll indulge me, I'll read those other parts
if you can just let me do Jelly first.''
</P>
<P>
   They agreed, and Viterelli said that after doing a bit of Jelly,
he was told not to bother with the other roles. Two days later he
got the call saying he would be Jelly.
</P>
<P>
   Viterelli said that acting came naturally and that he felt no
fear in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I don't know where I'm at,'' he said. ``I just do it.
It's all real for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The terror, he added, comes when he sees himself on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really frightening, but I'm not looking to do
Shakespeare or `Hamlet,' '' he said. ``I'm happy that people are
happy watching me.''

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. (BS) denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and
running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films
opening today appears on page 8. Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``AFFLICTION,'' starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem
Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader
(R, 114 minutes). Nolte is devastating in the performance of his
career, as Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing
battle with demons from his past.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them: Coburn, terrifyingly authentic as the
drunken, abusive father who long ago cowed his sons into
submission. As directed by Schrader, this pure, unfettered
adaptation of Russell Banks' novel starts on a deceptively ordinary
note, then escalates into inexorable fury. Every little detail
matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play the women who
trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``ANALYZE THIS,'' starring Robert De Niro and Billy
Crystal. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title,
concept and teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the
lights go down, so think of this comedy as an offer you can't
refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, De Niro is
hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic
goodfella style.
</P>
<P>
   His mobster finds just the right comic foil in Billy Crystal, as
the psychiatrist who utters the immortal: ``When I got into family
therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind.'' There's a lot more
where that came from in this breezy comic treat (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``BABY GENIUSES,'' starring Kathleen Turner and many toddlers.
Directed by Bob Clark (PG, 94 minutes). One way to get through this
guaranteed 100 percent laugh-free comedy is to wonder whether it
really is the worst film you've even seen. Probably not, but it's
pretty darn close. Woefully substandard production values give it a
ghastly look, made all the worse by the grotesque computer morphing
of young children into adult-style wise guys. The plotting is
shrill, bordering on incomprehensible. Ms. Turner lurches through
the film with a performance that just says, ``Hey, it's a living''
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``CENTRAL STATION,'' starring Fernanda Montenegro.
Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous
Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned
boy. There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder
of Salles' film is all in the telling. As these characters develop
a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them
vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father,
Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that
punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance
was one of last year's very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE CORRUPTOR,'' starring Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg.
Directed by James Foley (R, 111 minutes). A conventional but
above-average police drama set in Chinatown in New York City, ``The
Corruptor'' finds the rookie cop Danny Wallace (Wahlberg) learning
the ropes from his rule-bending partner, Nick Chen ( Chow), who has
gotten dangerously chummy with Chinatown's mob bosses.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is gritty, the action sequences sleek and the
questions the story raises about loyalty, ethics, friendship and
betrayal, although familiar, are still worth bringing up. ``The
Corruptor'' is a more effective showcase for the brooding charisma
of Chow, a Hong Kong action superstar, than ``The Replacement
Killers,'' his English-language debut (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN,'' starring Michelle
Pfeiffer, Treat Williams and Whoopi Goldberg. Directed by Ulu
Grosbard (PG-13, 108 minutes). Ms. Pfeiffer gives a fine, affecting
performance in this adaptation of Jacquelyn Mitchard's best seller.
And Grosbard carefully delineates its story of a child's
disappearance and its aftermath, showing the ways that such a
catastrophe affects his family. Restrained and unsentimental, this
astute drama deals thoughtfully with the chasm between real and
idealized family lives (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``EIGHT MILLIMETER,'' starring Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix.
Directed by Joel Schumacher (R, 120 minutes). This thriller delves
into the perverse underworld of the pornography business, shocking
audiences with the realization that sex and violence can be so
dull. Cage, seriously miscast, plays a private detective and
devoted family man who is suddenly, to his horror, drawn into the
realm of porn.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, this is where the film wanted to be even when its
opening scenes were stuck in suburban Pennsylvania. But the story's
parade of New York and Hollywood sleazeballs fails to deliver
either engaging drama or heartfelt kinks. Phoenix is
scene-stealingly good in a sidekick's role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,'' directed by and starring Roberto
Benigni (PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to
find humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his
risk pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly
entertaining as its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido
who jokes his way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Daring also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks
with a more somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the
maudlin and effectively creates a situation in which comedy is
courage. In this unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines
as a father whose fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and
no fear (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,'' starring Jason
Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Vinnie Jones and Nick Moran. Directed by
Guy Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since ``The Usual Suspects'' has
there been such an oversupply of cool macho schemers in a single
film. And they're served up with a quick, tart economy that
bespeaks the filmmaker's background making videos and commercials
_actually an advantage, for a change.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much beneath the surface here; what's most
entertaining is Ritchie's droll, hard-boiled storytelling and the
rogue's gallery of a cast that he has assembled. All the film need
do is juggle assorted miscreants and four separate gangs who,
figuratively speaking, can't shoot straight (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE,'' starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright
Penn and Paul Newman. Directed by Luis Mandoki (PG-13, 110
minutes). Nicholas Sparks' best-selling novel, about a lonely,
sensitive man who sends a message out to sea and the lonely,
beautiful woman who finds it, is now a long and soggy film.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Costner crosses the line from teasingly laconic to stodgy
and seems as likely to have written ``Bleak House'' as the love
letter in question. Robin Wright Penn makes an appealing heroine,
but there's not much room for real emotion in a film with the tenor
of a commercial for hazelnut-flavored coffee. As the hero's crusty
old father, Newman steals what's left of the show (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``OCTOBER SKY,'' starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper.
Directed by Joe Johnston (PG, 100 minutes). By far the most moving
scenes here are home movie snippets, circa 1957, that show the real
people on whom the film's characters are based. Otherwise, despite
being closely based on a best-selling memoir (``Rocket Boys'') by
the NASA engineer Homer H. Hickam Jr., this earnest, nostalgic film
has a way of seeming too good to be true.

REFRESHING `HARMONISTS' NOT SAME OLD SONG AND DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you were fortunate enough to catch the harrowing 1994 German
World War II drama, ``Stalingrad,'' you know that its director,
Joseph Vilsmaier, has as strong a feel for genre and character, and
as clear an eye for the epic, as any European filmmaker of this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Harmonists,'' he turns that eye toward a totally
different but no less structured movie genre: the musical
biography. The results are almost as impressive, and the film _
which is getting a big U.S. push from Miramax _ is likely to
finally establish him as one of Germany's top directors.
</P>
<P>
   His subject is the Comedian Harmonists, a six-man German a
cappella group that is far from a household word in this country,
but was a sensation in Germany and much of the rest of Europe in
the late 1920s and early '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Their story begins in 1927 when a 20-year-old drama student
named Harry Frommermann (Ulrich Noethen) decides to model a German
singing ensemble after the American group The Revellers, and places
an advertisement for open auditions in a Berlin newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   As the sextet comes together, it passes through the usual stages
we've come to expect from the musical biopic: endless rehearsals,
personnel squabbles, a disastrous audition in front of an important
agent (who rudely tells them they stink), and the gradual discovery
of their unique sound.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, they move on to fame and fortune; tour Europe and the
States; and develop a stronger and even more unique comedy element
to their act _ while offstage Frommermann and the group's other
leader, Robert Biberti (Ben Becker), contend for the favors of the
same girl (Meret Becker).
</P>
<P>
   What gives their story a particular bite is that three of the
members _ half the group _ are Jewish, so their rise against the
growth of Nazism in Germany of the early '30s puts them on a
collision course that the audience feels right from the opening
frames.
</P>
<P>
   The film debuted locally last weekend at the Jewish Film
Festival, but it's not really a Holocaust film and, like
``Stalingrad,'' its sensibility is much more sympathetic to the
German people than we're used to seeing in movies dealing with that
era.
</P>
<P>
   Vilsmaier's main point of view and most admirable character in
the film is the non-Jewish Biberti, who is more vocal in his hatred
of the Nazis than the Jewish characters, and stands as a
representative of the ``good'' Germans who claimed they didn't see
Hitler coming, but loathed him when he did.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your feelings about this slight twist, ``The
Harmonists'' is a big, broad, period musical that wonderfully
recreates the Berlin of the ``Cabaret'' era, gives us a series of
entertaining and splashy production numbers, and does what '90s
cinema so often fails to do: It tells us a story that we haven't
heard before.

 UNDATED: be true.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The film's simplicity is appealing, as is Gyllenhaal in the
central role of a boy in a West Virginia coal mining town who
becomes obsessed with rocketry. But the story, filled with
father-son conflict and down-in-the-ground versus up-in-the-sky
contrasts, often follows a familiar trajectory (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``PAYBACK,'' starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry. Directed by
Brian Helgeland (R, 110 minutes). In this inept, excessively
sadistic film-noir spoof adapted from the same Richard Stark novel
(``The Hunter'') that inspired the 1967 genre classic ``Point
Blank,'' Gibson is a thief named Porter who retaliates with a
vengeance after an attempt on his life.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to recover $70,000 that was stolen from him by a
double-crossing partner in crime, he works his way up the pecking
order of a crime syndicate, brutally dispatching all who stand in
his way. The hard-boiled dialogue is ludicrous, the storytelling
clunky, the acting fair to awful, the gore ankle deep. Credit the
star with being able to keep a straight face through this loathsome
mess (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,'' starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon,
Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies and Edward Burns. Directed by Steven
Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly magnificent new
film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning back the clock to
restore passion and meaning to the genre, he works in a spirit of
urgent communication to look at war as if it has not been looked at
before.
</P>
<P>
   Tour-de-force battle scenes are frank without sensationalism,
and the same great storyteller who made you believe there was an
extraterrestrial hiding in the closet has made this an irresistibly
vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks continues to astonish with admirable
modesty, and the rest of the casting is comparably inspired. As he
did with ``Schindler's List,'' Spielberg has made a landmark film
of devastating power (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,'' starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth
Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush. Directed by John Madden (R, 113
minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an
exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film
unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm
and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of
his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a
fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``TANGO,'' starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and
directed by Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro
(PG-13, 100 minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and
virtuosity. And it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say
that the dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most
electrifying dance film, Saura offers transfixingly beautiful
glimpses of the dance and the great range of emotions it can
conjure. Storaro's dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the
nuances this material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly
consumed by tango fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE THIN RED LINE,'' starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick
Nolte and Sean Penn. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes).
From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely
derived from James Jones' Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear
that Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style
that made ``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven'' the most beautiful
films of the 1970s is instantly apparent here, even if the
narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual
poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter
editing. Bottom line: No one who admired Malick's early work should
miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it
here (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``20 DATES,'' starring Myles Berkowitz. Directed by Berkowitz
(R, 88 minutes). The filmmaker's gimmick is to make a film about
dating. His goal: to go out with 20 different women, get them on
camera by any means necessary and promise to fall in love with one
before the experiment is over.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz, pesty and proud of it, has absorbed enough of Jerry
Seinfeld and Garry Shandling to create a diffident, nit-picking,
sitcom-ready persona. But whenever his film establishes a playful
mood, it's liable to do something to make you squirm. Crassness and
mock candor aren't all that funny (unless they're coming from
Albert Brooks, whose ``Real Life'' paved the way for this). And
discovering that cheese makes Berkowitz constipated or that one of
his dates disappoints him by not looking enough like Jessica Rabbit
is more than you need to know (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``200 CIGARETTES,'' starring Paul Rudd, Kate Hudson and Courtney
Love. Directed by Risa Bramon Garcia (R, 102 minutes). This
contrived but cheery party movie is the feature directing debut of
a well-known casting director. And in making her film, Ms. Garcia
does what she does best: cast. A group of bright young players is
brought together for a largely plotless New Year's Eve, rambling
around a colorfully evoked East Village, circa 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially just a set of interwoven skits, this comedy still
makes good use of the actors noted above, along with Casey Affleck
as a nice-guy punk, Dave Chappelle as a cabbie full of advice and
Martha Plimpton as a hopeless hostess. Ms. Hudson, who is Goldie
Hawn's daughter and has her mother's grin and giggle, makes an
adorable debut despite spending part of the movie with dog
excrement on her coat (Maslin).

   WASHINGTON _ New help for private employers in recruiting
college-educated applicants with disabilities was announced
Thursday by the President's Committee on Employment of the
Handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program helps us get on with the business of making a
living and serving others by so doing,'' said Ellen Rogers, one of
the 299 persons who received paid internships or jobs last year
under a similar program for federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of three said her poor vision led to being turned
down for 12 different jobs in schools in and around Tampa, Fla.,
despite her master's degree in English. But the Workforce
Recruitment Program helped her get a summer internship in a Public
Health Service office in Rockville, Md., where she then was hired
for a permanent job.
</P>
<P>
   To expand the program to private jobs, the committee's
recruiters interviewed 1,200 seniors and recent graduates on 148
college and university campuses during this school year. Then they
prepared a CD-ROM that contains a brief resume and the
interviewer's evaluation of the credentials, abilities and
attitudes of each of the 1,026 job-seekers from 143 campuses in 34
states who were judged qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Most are seeking jobs or internships in administration,
engineering, computer work or science. But the CD-ROM, which can
searched by state or job category, includes applicants for just
about every kind of white-collar job.
</P>
<P>
   Employers can obtain the free CD-ROM by faxing a request on
company letterhead to the attention of ``WRP Manager'' at (202)
376-6868. Or they can call toll-free at 800-526-7234 to have a
specialist use the CD-ROM to prepare them a list of job-seekers who
appear to meet specific job qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters from big companies said the new program will be
useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this tight job market, we're trying in every way, shape or
form to locate qualified people,'' said Joel Kahn, an engineer at
Procter &AMP; Gamble headquarters in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a business basis, as well as a moral one,'' said
Phyllis Jackson of Bank of America. ``Our customer base, our
associate population (employees) and the labor force include people
with disabilities. If we're going to be an effective employer and
competitor, we have to tap into that market.''

SOPHISTICATED TALE OF CANNIBALISM SETTLES FOR OVERCOOKED
CAMPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This darkly funny, subversively arch horror film is smarter than
most. At least for the first hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravenous'' fortunately shies away from the formulaic high
school or college campus-set teenage slice-and-dice that has
permeated the genre for the past decade. And its cast is above par
as well, featuring a smart blend of international talent, including
Australian Guy Pearce (``L.A. Confidential''), Briton Robert
Carlyle, who had his first big hit with ``The Full Monty,'' and
American Jeremy Davies (``Saving Private Ryan'').
</P>
<P>
   The movie has a rather sophisticated, psychological dimension
despite the grim theme and the trouble the production apparently
weathered. Initially the film was to have been directed by Milcho
Manchevski, but he was replaced by English director Antonia Bird
(``Priest'').
</P>
<P>
   Bird brings a suitably gray, rugged and gritty texture to
``Ravenous,'' which is set in 1847 just after the Mexican-American
War. Young Captain John Boyd (Pearce) has just been awarded a medal
for bravery but secretly knows he acted with cowardice, pretending
to be dead in order to avoid being killed in battle. His body is
pitched onto a pile of corpses and the bloody, blown bodies drip
onto him, scarring him forever to the horrors of the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd's superior officer brusquely transfers him to a remote
outpost in the California Sierra Nevada as a kind of punishment.
Boyd's new regiment includes the drunken Knox (Stephen Spinella),
religious Toffler (Davies), war-monger Reich (Neal McDonough),
crazy Cleaves (David Arquette) and commanding officer Hart (Jeffrey
Jones).
</P>
<P>
   One day a stranger appears. Colqhoun (Carlyle) is half-starved
and freezing and as he thaws, he relays a horrible tale; he was
traveling with a group of settlers when the accompanying officer,
Colonel Ives, suggested a shortcut through rough terrain. The
settlers are waylaid by a snowstorm and are forced to take refuge
in a cave during the terrible winter, which has just begun. Slowly,
the food disappears. They eat the oxen, the horses and a dog. One
of the party dies and they eat him. Soon they begin to kill each
other to survive. Only Colqhoun has escaped. But there is still one
woman left in the cave with Ives, and he has developed a ravenous
taste for human flesh and blood. Hart decides he and his men will
make the three-day trek to save the woman's life. But Colqhoun
isn't being quite honest and soon the small band of soldiers find
they are up against an unmitigated terror with a huge appetite. And
they're the main course.
</P>
<P>
   Bird and screenwriter Ted Griffin combine the myth that one who
ingests the flesh of another will gain the victim's strength and
spirit with references to such historical horrors as the Donner
Party. The result is a grisly tale of cannibalism that is original
and initially suspenseful.
</P>
<P>
   After that, however, ``Ravenous'' stumbles. It doesn't know what
to do with itself or how to end its story, so it relies upon a
one-on-one duel between good and evil set against a bloodbath of
body parts that feels out of place with everything that has come
before.
</P>
<P>
   Had the script maintained the same deft rawness and energy of
its set-up, the film could have been a rare contender in the horror
genre, but it settles, unfortunately, for over-cooked campiness
instead.

SO MANY FLAWS MAKE A LIE OF `TRUE CRIMES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like his last few films, producer-director-star Clint Eastwood's
latest offering, ``True Crime,'' seems a return to the kind of
flimsy storytelling and sloppy filmmaking that characterized his
career in the '80s. More and more, his 1992 ``Unforgiven'' triumph
seems a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he plays one of the more preposterous journalists to ever
grace the screen, and an all-around lout _ irresponsible father,
philandering husband, self-pitying alcoholic _ who Eastwood the
director obviously believes is actually a pretty cool guy.
</P>
<P>
   The plot has this Oakland Tribune reporter and his ``famous nose
for a story'' racing the clock to prove that a man (Isaiah
Washington) on death row for murdering a young woman is actually
innocent. Yes, roughly the same plot as the 1948 Jimmy Stewart
classic, ``Call Northside 777.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Stewart took a few weeks to do the job, Eastwood has
12 hours and the handicap of having to take his daughter to the
zoo, write a human interest story on the execution and cover up his
extramarital affair with the wife of his editor (Dennis Leary).
It's a busy day.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood fans will find a few Dirty Harry-ish one-liners to
relish and a few entertaining (if highly improbable exchanges) with
the Trib's managing editor (James Woods). Also to its credit, the
film has an unusually good feel for Oakland (Eastwood's boyhood
home).
</P>
<P>
   But its story is so clumsy, predictable and dependent on
coincidence that it's never much fun as a mystery; and so absurd
and anachronistic as a newspaper drama (taking place in a macho
journalistic world that didn't even exist in the '30s, much less
the yuppified '90s) that it's just plain stupid.
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't help the credibility of the movie that the
convict is so completely noble _ a born-again Christian, a devoted
husband and father, a combination of Sidney Poitier and Dr. Ralph
Bunch. The man's too obviously innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``True Crime'' is also not helped by the fact that Eastwood the
star looks like Methuselah having a bad day. You wish he'd, if not
have a face-lift, at least brush his hair. The scenes in which he's
striking nude poses in bed with his mistress or putting the make on
a 23-year-old co-worker are almost pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Other superstars of his generation _ Dustin Hoffman, Warren
Beatty, Jack Nicholson _ have found ways to successfully temper
their persona and grow old gracefully on the screen. But this part
almost seems to have been written for an actor in his 20s. Never in
his 40-year-career has Eastwood been so completely, tragically
miscast.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will be much cooler Friday as brisk winds usher in
chilly air from Canada. A slow-moving storm over the St. Lawrence
Valley will circulate moisture into the higher terrain of New
England and this will produce snow showers. Air descending the east
slopes of the Appalachians will become noticeably drier leading to
frequent intervals of sunshine along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of cooler air will reach into the Southeast
ending the brief warm spell. Sunshine will dominate as temperatures
return to near seasonal levels. Florida will stay rather warm and
quite dry.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure crested near Lake Superior will dominate
conditions over the Middle West. Sunny skies and light winds will
accompany seasonable conditions in the western Lakes. A return flow
of milder air from the south will promote above normal readings in
the northwest Plains and northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   A large, but weakening disturbance over Texas will drift
eastward. Clouds will cover much of the southern Plains and western
lower Mississippi Valley. Chilly rain will dampen Oklahoma and
southern Kansas. A little wet snow will diminish over the
panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. Cooler and drier weather will
spread into south Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Mild air and a mixture of clouds and sun will cover most of the
Northwest. A disturbance entering California will bring a variety
of unsettled conditions. Rain will dampen much of the Central
Valley with snow in the Sierra. Showers will move into the southern
sections with thickening clouds in the deserts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Winds of March
</P>
<P>
   March is known for its wind. Large temperature contrasts, which
provide energy for storms with high winds, linger during the third
month. Though the Arctic's coldest assault has long passed,
burgeoning warmth from the tropics regenerates temperature
differences across the nation. While readings reached 70s in the
Ohio Valley on Thursday, there were periods of snow across the
northwestern Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   On stormless days, the sun's energy stirs up the lower
atmosphere, blending winds near the ground with stronger winds from
above, thereby spawning the famous breezes of March.

DRAMA AND INTRIGUE: OSCARS PROMISE TO KEEP US ON EDGE OF OUR
SEATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past few weeks, the armada of critics, pundits, Wall
Street analysts and Vegas odds-makers who handicap the Academy
Awards have been almost unanimously saying Sunday night's Oscar
Fest is the most wide open of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   As we enter Oscar weekend, that consensus is beginning to look
like an understatement: this 71st running of moviedom's biggest
event could be one of the more totally unpredictable of all time _
that rare Oscar-cast in which no outcome seems impossible, or
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   This strange haze in the collective crystal ball is, of course,
due mostly to the presence of two unusually strong contenders for
the lion's share of prizes _ each so strong, in fact, that they've
thrown the near-exact science of Oscar forecasting out of kilter.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be the year of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' in
the same way last year was the year of ``Titanic.'' When it was
released last July, Variety suggested the Academy might ``just
Fed-Ex the Oscars over to (Steven) Spielberg's house and save
everybody the trouble of voting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oscar voters have notoriously short memories, and the World
War II epic's overpowering lead for the best picture honors has
diminished during the past six months, and leveled to near 50-50
since the year-end release of that anachronistic charmer,
``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the front-runner? ``Ryan'' won most of the critics
accolades and still has the edge of being the weightier subject,
but ``Shakespeare'' received the most nominations (13 to ``Ryan's''
11). In 14 of the past 15 Oscar races, the top prize has gone to
the picture with the most nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare'' also won the best ensemble cast award _ the
equivalent of best picture _ at the recent Screen Actor's Guild
Awards (another accurate indicator of how the Oscars will go, since
most of the 5,000 Academy members are from the acting branch).
</P>
<P>
   And ``Shakespeare'' also has the Miramax publicity machine going
for it. This is not a small factor, since the Tiffany's of movie
distributors has re-written the book on Oscar campaigns in the
'90s, and spent more than $10 million to boost the chances of
``Shakespeare'' alone.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the situation is the fact the best picture field
contains two other films that have striking similarities to the
front-runners: ``The Thin Red Line,'' a second WWII combat film,
and ``Elizabeth,'' a second Elizabethan period piece (ironically
with two of the same stars as ``Shakespeare'').
</P>
<P>
   When similar films are nominated for the same award, they tend
to cancel each other out, or at least take away a significant
number of votes from each other. So the door could be open for the
long-shot best-picture victory of the fifth nominee, Roberto
Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, maybe it's not such a long-shot. The
Italian Holocaust comedy also has the Miramax publicity machine
behind it, it's received more nominations than any foreign-language
film in history, and it offers voters an opportunity to make
history with Oscar's first foreign-language best picture.
</P>
<P>
   Because the top spot is so wide open, this could also be one of
those rare years when the picture and director races split, which
has not happened since 1989. Torn between the two worthy films (as
in 1972, between ``The Godfather'' and ``Cabaret''), Oscar voters
have occasionally given one best picture, the other best director.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down the rest of the list, the only sure-thing seems to
be Gwyneth Paltrow of ``Shakespeare.'' Not only has she won the SAG
and Golden Globe actress awards for this slot, her
movie-star-radiant performance as the inspiration of literature's
greatest love story is the spirit _ the keynote _ of her movie.
</P>
<P>
   Her chances look ever better alongside her competition: Meryl
Streep in the underwhelming ``One True Thing;'' Australia's Cate
Blanchett in the highly overrated ``Elizabeth;'' and Brazil's
Fernanda Montenegro and England's Emily Watson in the little seen
``Central Station'' and ``Hilary and Jackie,'' respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Oscar slots are up for grabs _ especially best
actor. Ian McKellen of ``Gods and Monsters'' may still wear the
smile of a winner, but veteran Nick Nolte of ``Affliction'' is the
sentimental favorite, two-time winner Tom Hanks of ``Ryan'' is
America's most beloved star, and Hollywood has fallen in love with
goofy Roberto Benigni of ``Life Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even darkest of dark horses Edward Norton of ``American History
X'' would seem to have a shot. As the only one of the best actor
nominees to take the high road and not mount an Oscar campaign, he
could be the beneficiary of the growing resentment of the buying of
the Oscar. This stand-back approach has certainly worked for
Katharine Hepburn over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting actor category is even more of a dogfight. Oscar
voters have lately made a habit of giving this prize to slumming
A-level stars (hence last year's Robin Williams) and to previous
best-actor winners (like 1992's Gene Hackman) so Robert Duvall of
``A Civil Action'' (who won the SAG award) and Geoffrey Rush of
``Shakespeare in Love'' both look strong here.
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Harris, the godlike manipulator of ``The Truman Show,''
could be the beneficiary of his film's slight in not getting a
best-picture nomination; 40-year-veteran James Coburn of
``Affliction'' is more than worthy of a career-achievement award;
and Billy Bob Thornton of ``A Simple Plan'' took not one but two of
the year-end critics awards.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting actress field is similarly tough. Kathy Bates of
``Primary Colors'' _ the only American in this field _ perfectly
embodies America's mixed feelings about the Clinton sex scandal.
And even though her performance in ``Shakespeare'' is tiny,
England's Judy Dench could take home a consolation prize for losing
out last year as a later Queen of England in ``Mrs. Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be counted out are Dench's fellow British
previous-nominees, Lynn Redgrave, the befuddled German housemaid of
``Gods and Monsters,'' and Brenda Blethyn, the shrewish mother of a
bizarre musical genius in ``Little Voice''; or even Australia's
Rachel Griffiths, the loyal sister of another musical genius in
``Hilary and Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, the lower-profile awards will balance the ticket of
the higher-profile awards. Thus, if ``Life Is Beautiful'' misses
best picture and best actor, it will surely take best foreign
language film. And ``Shakespeare'' and ``Ryan'' will, in some
arrangement, split the awards for screenplay, art direction,
cinematography, sound, score, editing and make-up.
</P>
<P>
   The good news about all this Oscar uncertainty is that it makes
for more interesting viewing on Oscar night. In contrast to last
year's dull tribute to James Cameron, this year's event should
offer surprises, upsets and genuine drama.
</P>
<P>
   With the move to Sunday night further shaking things up, and the
possibility of a boo-out for honorary winner Elia Kazan (still
loathed by much of Hollywood for naming names in the McCarthy era),
the 71st promises to be the most exciting Oscar show in years.
</P>
<P>
   Here, based on an unscientific mixture of the usual pre-Oscar
indicators, gut feelings, wild guesses and my own sense of who
deserves to win, are my personal picks:

 &HT;    HOUSE MEMBERS, CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS CONDEMN 'RACIST' COUNCIL
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan group of House members, civil rights
leaders and conservative activists Thursday called on Congress to
adopt a resolution condemning the Council of Conservative Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The council ``attempts to mask its hateful ideology by posing as
a mainstream conservative think tank, but the racist agenda of this
group is undeniable,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., who
introduced the resolution and organized the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CCC has directed its hatred towards millions of Americans,
including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Jewish Americans,
homosexuals, immigrants and virtually all minorities,'' Wexler
said.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which critics have dubbed the ``white-collar Ku Klux
Klan,'' became the center of political controversy recently after
it was reported that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
and Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., have spoken to the group. Lott and Barr
have disavowed the organization's views, but have declined to
condemn the group.
</P>
<P>
   The council issued a statement denying the allegations raised
against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Council of Conservative Citizens categorically rejects
'white supremacy,' 'anti-Semitism,' 'neo-Nazi ideology' and the use
of violence, and we have always done so. These charges are lies,''
said Gordon L. Baum, the council's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center said an
extensive study indicated ``there is a great deal of evidence that
this is a flat-out racist group.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension flared at the news conference when several people who
identified themselves as council members challenged Wexler to
denounce the militant Jewish Defense League. When Wexler declined
to comment, they yelled: ``Why the double standard?''
</P>
<P>
   The most devastating criticism of the group came from
conservative columnist and author Arianna Huffington, who called
for Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi to denounce the group and for
former Vice President Dan Quayle to drop Fordice from Quayle's
presidential exploratory committee until he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to expressions of racism and bigotry, saying
that you disagree with them is not enough,'' Huffington said.
``There can be zero tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffington said the Republican Party's efforts to reach out to
blacks, Hispanics and other minorities were contradicted by the
failure of its leaders to condemn the council.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Andersen, president of the Douglass Policy Institute and a
vice chairman of the Republican National Committee's New Majority
Council, which is aimed at attracting blacks and other minorities
to the GOP, echoed Huffington's call for Quayle is disassociate
himself from Fordice.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y., said he was hopeful Wexler's
resolution would be allowed a vote by House leaders. An alternative
resolution condemning racism and anti-Semitism in general, but not
identifying any specific groups, has been offered by Rep. J.C.
Watts, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., chairman of the Congressional Black
Caucus, and Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., chairman of the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said they were not trying to stifle
free speech but were taking a stand against the organization's
message.

OSCAR NIGHT: TIPS FOR THE BEST VIEW AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Whoopi Goldberg opens the telecast of the 71st Academy
Awards ceremony Sunday, it will be like the season premiere of a
much-loved series, back by popular demand with a large cast of
familiar faces, and some new ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   After years of viewing the event, whether privately or at a
raucous Oscar Night bash, each of us knows pretty much what to
expect. But for anyone seeking a more fulfilling viewing
experience, we offer these guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   COMPLETE COVERAGE: Maybe it's the deluge of decolletage that
spills out at Oscar time like an avalanche of cantaloupes in the
produce aisle, but trust me on this: The sexiest fashions are the
ones that cover, not the ones that reveal.
</P>
<P>
   So don't spill merlot on the rug just to gaze upon the enhanced
flotation system of some fabric-challenged bimbette. The most vivid
Oscar-night image in my brain's photo gallery is of Nicole Kidman
two years ago in that spectacular high-necked chartreuse satin gown
by John Galliano. (As they say in all the fashion houses,
``Yowza!'') Right next to it is a shot of Jodie Foster from 1995 in
a higher-necked, jet-and-pearl beaded gown by Giorgio Armani.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, friends, cleavage is just a town in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   PICKING OUT PATTERNS. When trying to handicap the Oscar race and
impress friends at the same time, it helps to be knowledgeable
about movie history.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you need to know Cecil B. DeMille's middle name
(Blount) or Lauren Bacall's real name (Betty Joan Perske). But it
might come in handy to know that, in four of the past five years,
the winner of the Oscar for best actor has had a one-syllable last
name (Hanks, Hanks, Cage and Rush).
</P>
<P>
   This year's only monosyllabic hopeful: the estimable Tom Hanks.
Similarly, in four of the past five years the woman voted best
actress has had a two-syllable first name (Holly, Susan, Frances
and Helen). This year's nominees so favored: Gwyneth Paltrow and
Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   BLADDER PATROL. For some time now, the Oscar telecast has been
gracious enough to provide at least five bathroom breaks. These
occur when each of the five nominees for Best Original Song is
performed by Celine Dion or a Disney character. Incidentally, if
``When You Believe'' from ``The Prince of Egypt'' wins the Oscar
this year, it will be the seventh time in the past 10 years that
the best song is from an animated film.
</P>
<P>
   BLATHER PATROL. Where's Camryn Mannheim when you need her?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the winners this year will issue more thank-yous in 30
seconds than they've sent in the past 10 years, but few will say
anything of substance. Aside from Hanks, who's good for a few
minutes of pithy discourse, and the British nominees, who usually
manage to seem erudite, Oscar winners tend to be a surprisingly
inarticulate bunch. You'd think creative people could come up with
more than ``you like me, you really like me!''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a thought: Starting next year, the Academy should require
the nominees to prepare a short essay on their feelings about
winning the Oscar. Then, as they're reciting their little essays on
stage, a crawl at the bottom of the TV screen could provide the
perfunctory information that no one wants to hear: ``The winner
would like to thank God/Allah/Disney, his/her family, the
producers, the director, the cast members, the key grip, the best
boy, the worst boy, his/her manager/agent/publicist, not to mention
his/her sixth-grade music/history/gym teacher, for this honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to pass along this idea to anyone you know at the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   POTTY ON, DUDE. To prevent a nationwide outbreak of nodding off
_ scientific term: acute zoning-out syndrome _ the Oscar telecast
has graciously shied away from the big production numbers in recent
years. Still, there's always a moment of tribute that allows for
taking an additional potty break, or putting out the recycling
bins, or separating the junk mail from the important stuff like
Pizza Hut coupons.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with two war films in the spotlight, viewers can
probably expect a ``Kudos to Khaki'' salute sometime during the
evening. These are good times to take a breather, unless you have a
burning need to see John Wayne die one more time in ``Sands of Iwo
Jima.''
</P>
<P>
   MAN FOR ALL SEASONS. John Madden is nominated as best director
for ``Shakespeare in Love.'' If he wins, don't expect him to thank
Pat Summerall and all the folks at Fox Sports. It's not that John
Madden.
</P>
<P>
   QUIET ON THE SET. People who eat in the living room during an
Oscar telecast are protected by the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Example: If someone is holding a bowl of Chee-tos and a person
sitting nearby makes a hostile grab for some, the Chee-tos party
can invoke the Fourth Amendment, which covers illegal search and
seizure. However, if the Cheetos party hasn't had the sense to take
the Cheetos out of the bag and is rustling so noisily that no one
can hear Whoopi Goldberg explain the balloting procedures, the
aggrieved party can cite the Eighth Amendment's protection against
cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, it is permissible to send the violator to
another room and force him to watch whatever is on CBS.

<P>
   Talking head, one-person shows are, more often than not, tricky
balancing acts that turn into laborious, unsatisfying moviegoing
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Since cinema is such a visual medium, it's hard to keep interest
in a solo running dialogue filmed on a single set unless it's done
exceptionally well.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Julia Sweeney recounts her very personal
experiences dealing with parents, siblings, dreams and the deck of
cards we're dealt in life, as opposed to the hand we'd prefer to
have, with such great humor, wonder and wryness that the concept
works with grace and ease in ``God Said, `Ha!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her funny, intimate film, based on her stage show, was so
universal in appeal that it won the Golden Space Needle award for
best film at last year's Seattle International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for her work as a regular on ``Saturday Night Live''
and for the sexually ambiguous character Pat (whom she thankfully
avoids here), Sweeney recalls how she had just gone through a
friendly divorce, bought the bungalow of her dreams in Los Angeles
and was looking forward to spending some time alone reading,
cooking and hanging out with her cats.
</P>
<P>
   But fate intervened: Her brother Mike, who was diagnosed with
cancer, moved into her new pad. After Mike came her parents, who
made the long drive from Spokane, Wash., to be with their dying
son. The family cohabitated in Sweeney's little house for seven
months and, just when the cords were about to fray, Sweeney was
diagnosed with a rare form of cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney recounts how she immediately became a kid again under
her parents' surveillance and how hard it was to deal with dating
and sex beneath her folks' omnipresent eye.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a truckload of tragedy _ enough to make any sane person
crack under the stress and strain _ she touchingly proves with this
enjoyable visit, which was produced by her pal Quentin Tarantino,
that laughter is the best medicine for heartbreak and pain.

AFTER AIDS, ALONG COMES A NEW KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, March 25)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat

<TEXT>
<P>
   Marshall Aronowitz needs $250,000 for a liver. He doesn't think
he's going to raise it, yet he has no choice but to try. He needs a
liver transplant and insurance won't cover it because he is HIV
positive and people infected with the AIDS virus don't usually
qualify for transplants.
</P>
<P>
   But Marshall, who has lived for more than 15 years without
getting AIDS, thinks he's a good guinea pig. If a transplant works
for him, he says he'll be doing medical science a favor.
</P>
<P>
   The ironic part about Marshall's surviving AIDS is that two
years ago he found out he has hepatitis C. This is starting to be a
common double whammy for people who are dealing with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   For years he worried about getting something that had killed
most of his friends and would likely kill him. ``I don't know why I
survived,'' he says. ``All of my crowd are dead.'' He said one day
he started calling people he knew in different parts of the world
and it was the same with his friends in San Francisco. All gone.
</P>
<P>
   But Marshall lived, only to be tapped on the shoulder by another
would-be killer.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can now do more for someone with AIDS than they can with
hepatitis C. About the only thing they can do to fight hepatitis C,
which attacks the liver, is a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   But people with compromised immune systems, like AIDS patients,
were long considered bad risks for organ transplants because after
the procedure patients have to be on immune suppressor drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors began to rethink that a couple of years ago when the
epidemic changed and people started to live with new treatment
therapies. Marshall has been free of any of the infections
associated with AIDS and shows virtually no evidence of the virus
in his body. In December he qualified for a transplant and went on
the national liver registry at UCSF-Stanford Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But there are so few HIV patients with organ transplants that
it's too early to show a success rate. Many insurance companies,
like Marshall's, aren't yet convinced. Neither is MediCal.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the request for a quarter of a million dollars so he can
pay for it himself, if and when he moves to the top of the
transplant list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be living proof. My duty is to get this transplant
and stay very healthy and live very long so insurance companies
will no longer be able to say there's no proof it works. It's not
just for me. It's for anyone who follows me.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, after he tested HIV positive, he closed his
picture-framing and art restoration business in San Francisco, sold
his little Victorian and moved to rural Lake County where he
expected his condition to worsen and he'd die like his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid for two to three years to live,'' he says. All he hoped
for was not to die before his old Doberman. He made it through that
one's life and now has another Doberman.
</P>
<P>
   Things were starting to look up. He thought about working again.
Then two years ago he was diagnosed with hepatitis C, which he
figures he probably contracted about the same time he did the AIDS
virus. But this killer is even more insidious and took longer to
announce itself.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall speaks with great urgency and hauls out medical
records, transplant studies and medical journals from a bulging
briefcase to make his case. But he agrees he's asking for the moon
and that the world is full of needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people tell me I haven't a chance in hell of raising
this enormous amount of money, but I have to show some
initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   For a man who has lost just about everyone near and dear, he has
an amazing amount of hope and trust that things will go his way.
</P>
<P>
   His family, two sisters and an aunt, live in Florida where he
grew up. They can help out a little, but Marshall doesn't want to
lean on them.
</P>
<P>
   They actually thought he was dead until a few years ago.
``They'd been saying Kaddish (mourning prayer for the dead) for me
every year on my birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Rejoining the family circle, he says, ``has made life worth
living.''
</P>
<P>
   He's printed letters explaining his situation which he's sent to
friends and acquaintances and intends to distribute at an upcoming
AIDS conference in San Francisco. He's been trying to get to
Elizabeth Taylor and Sharon Stone, who both raise money for AIDS
research, and Naomi Judd, who does the same for hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can fund the first few transplants for people like me
and they're successful, then there won't be a reason for insurance
companies not to fund.''
</P>
<P>
   He's pretty indomitable even though he gets tired and has pain
from his fourth-stage cirrhosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone told me the other day they wished they had a new car
and I said, `Me, too, but I'll settle for a used liver.'''

   TAMPA, Fla. _ Once upon a time, when there were more orange
groves than golf courses in Florida, Tampa Bay was surrounded by a
series of distinct communities: industrial, ethnically mixed Tampa,
white-bread St. Petersburg and its retirees from the Midwest,
laid-back Bradenton and Clearwater and, down the coast a bit,
artsy, cosmopolitan Sarasota, where the circus spent the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never went to St. Petersburg,'' says my colleague David
Rosenbaum, who grew up in Tampa in the 1940s and '50s. ``We had the
port and the unions and Latins; they had the beaches and tourists
and shuffleboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in fact if not law, it's one big metropolitan area, laced
together with bridges and freeways. People watch the same
television stations and root for the same professional sports
teams. Many of them send their children to the booming, multicampus
University of South Florida. They shop at the same enormous malls,
like the the brand-new Citrus Park Town Center, until recently a
pasture, which drew upward of 100,000 cars on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   On the road maps, this entity of 2.5 million people doesn't
exist. Only the old place names are there. But everyone calls it
Tampa Bay, and it is a prototypical example of the Sun Belt's
explosive growth. Its subdivisions (mostly gated now) sprawl under
postcard-blue skies. Its service-based economy thrives, and
cultural and sporting diversions thrive with it.
</P>
<P>
   Even baseball spring training, a seasonal ritual hereabouts for
decades, is attracting new interest, thanks to last season's home
run derby and the sprucing up of some of the ball parks where the
big leaguers strut their stuff. No fewer than six teams train in
the area, including the New York Yankees, whose main owner, George
Steinbrenner, is a Tampa tycoon. They play their springtime games
at the immodestly named Legends Field at 1 Steinbrenner Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Summertime, and the living is easy, the Gershwins wrote; if they
had lived in Tampa Bay, they might have mentioned the other
seasons, too.
</P>
<P>
   The First Tourist
</P>
<P>
   Historians think Hernando de Soto was Tampa Bay's first tourist,
landing near modern Bradenton in 1539 and lingering only briefly
before heading west on a fruitless search for jewels and gold that
ended with his death on the banks of the Mississippi in 1542.
</P>
<P>
   Not much happened for the three centuries after that, until
Henry B. Plant built a railroad linking the bay to the rest of the
country in 1883. In 1891 he added the astonishing 500-room Tampa
Bay Hotel, built in an eccentric Moorish style, with keyhole-shaped
windows and 13 silvery minarets topped with golden crescents. It
had telephones in the rooms, electric lights, a private casino, two
ballrooms, a billiard room and a peacock park, almost making good
on Plant's pledge to ``turn this sandheap into the
Champs-Elysees.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa was the staging point for the U.S. forces dispatched to
Cuba in the Spanish-American War, and in the summer of 1898 the
Tampa Bay Hotel provided a broad veranda where Army and Navy
officers and assorted hangers-on could sit in rocking chairs,
sipping champagne and iced tea, waiting for orders.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Theodore Roosevelt was one of them, slipping away from
his Rough Riders camped on the flats east of town, according to
historian Edmund Morris, to spend three nights with his wife,
Edith, in one of the hotel's grander suites.
</P>
<P>
   One hot, sticky night, Roosevelt and his handpicked men rode
their horses into a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The expeditionary force sailed away in June, its commander
having received his orders to embark while coffee was being served
at the hotel one evening. The hotel never recaptured the glory of
the Gay Nineties, and it closed in 1930. But it still stands as a
monument to the man who built the Gulf Coast, used partly as a
municipal museum and partly by the University of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Waterfront Museums
</P>
<P>
   Once its railroad came, St. Petersburg flourished by luring
white-collar refugees from the cruel winters and high taxes in
Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. It is one of those cities, like Des
Moines, that were shaped by newspaper editors with a determination
to lead. They, too, came from the Midwest: W.L. Straub, who stopped
the industrialization of the waterfront, preserving it for tourism,
and his successor at The St. Petersburg Times, Nelson Poynter, who
campaigned hard for good government and civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Three art museums have opened along the waterfront in recent
years, lending a new dimension to the city and contributing to a
regional surge of cultural development. Oldest is the Museum of
Fine Arts, whose 20 galleries house a small but comprehensive
permanent collection. Its highlights, for me, include an
aggressively scarlet ``Poppy'' by Georgia O'Keeffe; a subtle Lely
portrait of Nell Gwyn, the actress mistress of Charles II; a
shimmering Monet from the Parliament series, ``Effect of Fog,'' and
a supremely 1920s portrait of Mr. and Mrs. Chester Dale,
benefactors of the National Gallery in Washington, by Guy Pene du
Bois.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, improbably sited next to a pleasure-boat
marina, is the world's largest collection of paintings and drawings
by the flamboyant Catalan Surrealist, Salvador Dali. There are
plenty of ``melting'' watches and a telephone shaped like a
lobster, the kinds of things that made Dali's fame, but the four
immense ``masterworks'' are the star attractions. The best of them,
``The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus,'' pays homage
to the explorer, to Dali's idol, Velazquez, and to Dali's wife and
muse, Gala.
</P>
<P>
   The third of the trio, the Florida International Museum, housed
in a former Maas Brothers department store, is not so much a museum
as a 20,000-square-foot hall for hire. It has no collection of its
own, relying instead on a succession of special shows: Romanov
treasures, artifacts of the Incas and, soon, roomsful of personal
effects and other objects associated with John F. Kennedy.

 TAMPA: F. Kennedy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To get to the best museum in the region, perhaps the best in
Florida, you have to take a drive. Happily, you go by way of the
magnificent Sunshine Skyway Bridge across the mouth of Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1987, patterned after the Brotonne Bridge across the
Seine near Rouen, it is supported by a single, central set of
cables rather than cables on both sides of the roadway. Many
consider it the most impressive span built in this country since
the Golden Gate Bridge in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   It will take you, eventually, to Sarasota, and the John and
Mable Ringling Museum of Art, a spectacular Italianate bayfront
building with gleaming white rooftop statues. Inside the spectacle
continues; Ringling was a circus man, with little taste for
understatement. He sought to stun with art as he did under the Big
Top, so he bought pictures by Baroque masters like Rubens and
Pietro da Cortona at a time when their exuberance was out of
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Today they anchor a collection of rare originality that ranges
from Guercino to Titian to Piero di Cosimo's ``Building of a
Palace.'' The high point, perhaps, is the quartet of gigantic
tapestry cartoons by Rubens, bought in 1926 from the Duke of
Westminster and shown in a 40-foot-high gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Performance Time
</P>
<P>
   Sarasota is also a center for the performing arts. Every
February and March its opera company stages four productions, and
it does not confine itself to warhorses. This year's program
includes ``May Night,'' an early, little-known, folkloric piece by
Rimsky-Korsakov, based on a Gogol story.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly for a city of only 50,000 or so, Sarasota supports
a 40-year-old Equity company at the Asolo Theater, adjacent to the
Ringling museum. Its current eight-month season includes new plays
by Jane Martin and Richard Greenberg, as well as four one-act
comedies by Shaw and plays by Wilder, Sheridan, Odets, Sherwood,
Joan Littlewood, Alfred Uhry and Steve Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Each June, Sarasota stages a well-regarded chamber music
festival, and all year long the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall,
painted a jarring shade of purple, presents an almost nightly
parade of visiting musicians. Recently the Boston Pops, the Berlin
Radio Symphony under Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos and the Moscow
Philharmonic have paid calls, along with the Moiseyev Dance
Company, the Guarneri String Quartet and Bernadette Peters. (Next
month, it closes for several months of repairs.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact the whole area is on a performing arts roll, with Ruth
Eckerd Hall in Clearwater, the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg
and the huge Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center in Tampa full to
overflowing with music and drama. On a single night not long ago
the local music fan could choose among Gordon Lightfoot, Tony
Bennett, the Rolling Stones and the Vienna Choir Boys.
</P>
<P>
   And that is not even reckoning with the Florida Orchestra, which
plays a seven-month season in several halls under the music
directorship of Jahja Ling, who is also Christoph von Dohnanyi's
No. 2 in Cleveland. The orchestra administers to the bay the
prescribed monthly doses of Mozart, Mahler and Beethoven, but this
year it has also programmed works by Hovhaness, Kodaly and William
Schuman.
</P>
<P>
   An Airport's Impact
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, bigger has proved to be better for Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the Tampa airport, which must be the best in the
country. Opened in 1972 and currently undergoing modernization, it
is more convenient in its state of upheaval than most airports at
their most settled. The main terminal is linked to four remote
buildings, housing the gates, by fast two-car automated trains that
run above ground, up in the sunshine, not buried in some dingy
tunnel. Bright, close in, with plenty of elevators and escalators
and lots of easily understood signs, TPA ought to be cloned
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the climate _ the sun is said to shine 361 days a
year _ the airport has helped to attract all kinds of businesses,
including the Home Shopping Network and back-office operations for
big financial institutions, as well as biotechnology and other
high-technology companies. (``High-tech in the mangroves,'' a local
booster calls them.)
</P>
<P>
   It has also brought tourists, who head west to 50 miles of
beaches along the Gulf of Mexico and east to Busch Gardens, the
wildly popular offshoot of the local Budweiser brewery.
</P>
<P>
   Animal Kingdoms
</P>
<P>
   You can take your wild animals in Tampa with or without roller
coasters. For the purist, there is the fine Lowry Park Zoo, where
you can see not only a Sumatran tiger but also a rare Florida
panther and a rarer Indian rhinoceros. It also specializes in the
rehabilitation of the manatee, an endangered species of huge,
cowlike marine creatures. Only 2,500 remain in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Busch Gardens is bigger and brassier. It has four roller
coasters, which flip and plunge and twist and climb until you think
you've left your insides in another time zone, and bumper cars
called Ubanga-Banga. (Geddit?) Its theme is Africa, more or less,
but no one is too rigorous about it; you will see koalas from
Australia and elephants from India and flamingos from Chile, too.
The ``Nairobi'' train station looks just like South Africa, not
Kenya, and the dolphin show inexplicably takes place in a mock-up
of landlocked Timbuktu.

`EARTHLY POSSESSIONS' REALLY STACKS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just to get noticed, familiar stories need special treatment. In
``Earthly Possessions,'' a pleasant HBO film based on the Anne
Tyler novel, it starts with the casting of Susan Sarandon in a rare
television role.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad beginning. But ``Earthly Possessions'' on Saturday has
a lot more going for it, including a sprightly script by Steven
Rogers (``Hope Floats'') and direction by James Lapine
(``Impromptu'') that makes an older woman/younger man romance
reasonably plausible.
</P>
<P>
   Though ages aren't specifically mentioned, it is safe to assume
that Sarandon's character, Charlotte Emory, is at least a
generation older than Stephen Dorff's unsophisticated bank robber,
Jake Simms, Jr. And yet a romantic connection between the two _ a
disillusioned homemaker taken hostage by a confused criminal _
makes sense in the chemistry Sarandon and Dorff manage to achieve.
Certainly it's more honest than the older man/younger woman
linkages so popular in current filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Because Tyler's hostage-in-love story is so timeworn, the key to
its success is the eccentricity of the characters. While Lapine
spends little time on Tyler's goofy assortment of supporting
players, he does coax enough oddness out of Sarandon to make
``Earthly Possessions'' richer than it might have been without her.
</P>
<P>
   With a beguiling sparkle in her wide-set eyes, Sarandon
successfully negotiates the trip from sheltered wife planning to
leave her husband, to frightened victim unsure of her future, to
sympathetic companion winning her captor's trust, to complicitous
lover willing to risk her life for his.
</P>
<P>
   As the film starts, both are failures in their lives, or so they
think. At the end, after several days on the lam, their voyage of
self-discovery has changed them both. Yes, we've seen this
transformation before, but Sarandon and Dorff make it a trip worth
taking again.

 TAMPA: landlocked Timbuktu.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But I doubt that there is anywhere else on this continent with
anything to rival the hundreds of antelopes and other animals that
roam more or less freely on Busch Gardens' simulation of the
Serengeti Plain. Many are rarities, seldom encountered in Africa:
greater kudus and blesboks, elands and addaxes, sable antelopes and
magnificent roan antelopes, bred at the park. Hokey the rides may
be, but the young staff members care a lot about the animals; one
of them, Erin Leach, spent 20 minutes establishing for me that a
spectacularly colored bird that neither of us recognized was a
saddle-billed stork.
</P>
<P>
   A good sequel to either Busch Gardens or the zoo is the new
Florida Aquarium in downtown Tampa, an $84 million, shell-shaped
extravaganza in green glass whose tanks contain exhibits of aquatic
life on Florida's coral reefs, in its oceanic depths and in its
streams and mangrove swamps _ everything from menacing sharks to
playful river otters to darting rainbow parrotfish.
</P>
<P>
   Questions of Identity
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is crazy about Tampa Bay's coming of age, and St.
Petersburg, in particular, worries about losing its identity.
Politicians there, and taxpayers, too, complain that visiting
out-of-towners too often assume they are in Tampa. They grumble
about politicians and reporters who came for the vice presidential
debate in 1996, and sportswriters who come to cover the new Tampa
Bay Devil Rays baseball team at the slope-domed Tropicana Field in
St. Petersburg, also the site of this year's college basketball
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa has lost something, too, in the regional amalgamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are turning Tampa into the customary nothing,''
complained mystery writer John D. MacDonald a quarter-century ago
in one of his Travis McGee novels, ``Bright Orange for the
Shroud.'' ``They've opened up the center of the city into a more
spacious characterlessness, and more and more they are converting
Ybor City into fake New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual the gloriously grumpy MacDonald overstated the case. If
the post-modern skyscrapers of downtown Tampa lack architectural
distinction, it is much less sterile than many late-blooming
cities, and the bankers, lawyers and deal makers have to work
somewhere, don't they? As for Ybor City, where Hispanic tobacco
workers and Italian immigrants once lived, it has indeed turned
into an ersatz French Quarter, loaded with wrought-iron balconies
and chockablock with bars; on Friday and Saturday nights, it
belongs to the young and the rowdy.
</P>
<P>
   Old-Time Flavor
</P>
<P>
   Only faint hints remain of the days, long before a new
generation of immigrants arrived from Castro's Cuba, when Ybor City
was the cigar capital of the world. Along Seventh Avenue, you can
still see the Columbia Restaurant, now frequented mainly by
tourists, and the neoclassical Italian Club.
</P>
<P>
   But Tampa has not lost all of its authentic Latin flavor. To
sample that, visit La Teresita at 3248 West Columbus Drive, a
landmark Cuban-American restaurant with green oilcloth on the
tables, nestled amid shabby stores selling guava turnovers and
Cuban sandwiches, not far from the airport. Go for Sunday lunch if
you can, eat the Capdevila family's wonderful black beans and
yellow rice, with vinegary roast pork on the side, and drink a cafe
con leche. (I did; it cost $8.81 with tax and tip.) And be sure to
look around. The clientele is young and old, rich and poor, Anglo
as well as Latino: rednecks mingling with blue rinses, young girls
in communion dresses with older ones wearing skimpy crop-tops.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has St. Petersburg (named by a pioneer developer for his
Russian hometown) lost all its old Midwestern blandness in the rush
to tomorrow. It remains a low-key place, represented by politicians
like Rep. C.W. Bill Young, the chairman of the powerful House
Appropriations Committee, a conservative, of course, but not the
kind who goes out of his way to punch you in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   If you linger a while in the vicinity of Fourth Avenue North and
Fifth Street, you will see institutions that cater to the city's
still sizable geriatric population: the St. Petersburg Chess Club,
the St. Petersburg Lawn Bowling Club, founded in 1926, and the
proudly self-proclaimed ``World's Largest Shuffleboard and
Duplicate Bridge Club,'' on the shore of Mirror Lake.

   A VISIT TO THE TAMPA BAY AREA
</P>
<P>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Here is information about visiting the Tampa Bay area of
Florida:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   DON CESAR BEACH RESORT, 3400 Gulf Boulevard, St. Pete Beach,
(727) 360-1881. Discerningly restored a few years ago, this
peachy-pink neo-Moorish palace, built in 1928, offers a fine beach,
a spa, tennis courts, two pools and 232 handsome rooms. If Scott
and Zelda stayed there, as everyone says, they knew the town as St.
Petersburg Beach; local lawmakers, no poets, later clipped off two
syllables in the interests of brevity. Double room rate: $289 to
$329 weekdays; $319 to $359 on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   HYATT REGENCY WESTSHORE, 6200 Courtney Campbell Causeway, Tampa,
(813) 874-1234. Facing tranquil Tampa Bay, surrounded by flora and
fountains, this crisply up-to-date, 14-story, 400-room hotel stands
a head or two taller than the average Hyatt. It has three top-notch
restaurants; Oystercatchers, named after a clever, bivalve-loving
local bird, serves the region's best seafood. Double room rate:
$225 weekdays; $149 on weekends through April, then $179.
</P>
<P>
   LONGBOAT KEY CLUB, 301 Gulf of Mexico Drive, Longboat Key, (941)
383-8821. A resort, not really a club, on the strip of land across
Sarasota Bay from Ringling-town, it emphasizes sports, with 45
championship golf holes and 38 tennis courts. The 213 trim rooms
have kitchens and washer-dryers. Double room rate: $220 to $335;
apartments from $270 to $735.

 TAMPA: to $735.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENAISSANCE VINOY RESORT, 501 Fifth Avenue NE, St. Petersburg,
(727) 894-1000. On the bayfront in downtown St. Petersburg, the
Vinoy is another reborn survivor from the 1920s. Pink as a flamingo
on the outside, ornate on the inside, with stenciled pecky cypress
beams in the lobby, it is listed on the National Register of
Historic Places. Its 360 luxurious rooms, plus pools, steam room,
tennis courts and croquet lawn, attract an affluent clientele.
Double room rate: $259; $139 starting in June.
</P>
<P>
   WYNDHAM HARBOUR ISLAND, 725 South Harbour Island Boulevard,
Tampa, (813) 229-5000. There's nothing too special about this
modern establishment except the location, but that's very special
indeed: on an artificial island, linked by bridge and monorail to
skyscraper-studded downtown Tampa. The rooms are amply sized, and
there's an on-site marina, if you're taking your sailboat. Double
room rate: $149; $99 in April.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   BEACH BISTRO, 6600 Gulf Drive, Anna Maria Island, west of
Bradenton, (941) 778-6444. Four good reasons to visit this
out-of-the-way spot: 1. remarkable smoked salmon, which the
Canadian proprietor imports weekly from J. Willy Krauch, an
artisanal smoker in Tangier, Nova Scotia; 2. moist, perfectly
cooked grouper, the local fish of choice; 3. a bountiful wine list,
which includes Australia's prized Grange and five vintages of
Chateau Pichon Longueville; 4. fabulous sunsets over the gulf. Only
one quibble: Here as elsewhere in the area there is a regrettable
tendency to litter plates with superfluous garnishes.
</P>
<P>
   BOCA, 1930 E. Seventh Ave., Ybor City section of Tampa, (813)
241-2622. Boca's Nueva Latina dishes include shrimp ajillo (with
garlic), exceptional flan and updated Cuban sandwiches (ham, roast
pork and Swiss cheese on light Cuban bread). The surprise is the
house salad, a tangy blend of field greens, manchego cheese,
tomatoes and onions, dressed with a guava- and chili-flavored
vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   MISE EN PLACE, 442 West Kennedy Boulevard, Tampa, (813)
254-5373. Marty Blitz pioneered modern American cooking in the
region, and his restaurant remains the local leader. A plate of
tasty house-made charcuterie epitomizes the ambition and technical
savvy of the kitchen. I was taken with a mustard-crusted rack of
lamb, served on a hillock of Cheddar grits and moistened with a
bourbon shallot demi-glace. The room is suave, the service less so.
</P>
<P>
   TED PETERS SMOKED FISH, 1350 Pasadena Avenue South, St.
Petersburg (727) 381-7931. This is the place, a local foodie told
me, that he'd take Calvin Trillin to if he ever came to St.
Petersburg. Since 1950, not long after the proprietor pulled into
town from Olean, N.Y., this roadside shack has dished up definitive
versions of local delicacies like smoked mackerel and gray mullet,
as well as a tangy fish spread that tastes best on saltines.
</P>
<P>
   REDWOOD, 247 Central Ave., St. Petersburg, (727) 896-5118.
Competent Pacific Rim cooking near the Atlantic rim, in a restored
downtown storefront. I wish the menu featured more fish from the
gulf and less marlin, albacore and yellowfin flown across the
continent, but that didn't keep me from enjoying a nicely presented
sashimi of rich ahi tuna coated with sesame seeds. The handsome
copper bar is stocked with premium cognacs and single-batch
bourbons.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBERN'S, 2208 West Morrison Ave., Tampa, (813) 258-2233. For
decades the only Tampa Bay restaurant with a national reputation
was Bern's, known for an awesome wine list, good steaks and not
much else. It carries on. But the sizzle has shifted to SideBern's,
down the street, where Jeannie Pierola, a gifted young chef of
eclectic bent, sets off fireworks nightly with westernized dim sum,
like duck buns with vinegar syrup and crab-lobster dumplings with
tamarind butter; Moroccan seared red snapper with harissa, and
(homage to the older generation) a dynamic duo of short ribs and
hanger steak. Selections from Bern's cellar insure that you won't
leave thirsty.

   CLINTON-KOSOVO _ WASHINGTON _ The signing of a Kosovo peace
accord Thursday by ethnic Albanians pushed President Clinton to the
brink of a military showdown with Yugoslav President Slodoban
Milosevic. ''We have reached the final and decisive phase,'' said
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, warning that plans are complete
for NATO air strikes against Serbs forces and facilities. The
Pentagon warned of a perilous mission and Senate Republicans began
asking tough questions about the nature, objectives and exit
strategy for yet another U.S. venture into the troubled Balkans.

APPEALING `FARSCAPE' BLASTS OFF ON RATHER CHEEKY TRAJECTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anyone can't wait till ``Star Wars'' mania officially kicks
into warp drive in May, there's always ``Farscape'' on the Sci-Fi
Channel. Starring Ben Browder in the hunky-guy role and Australian
actress Claudia Black in the strong-woman role, ``Farscape'' isn't
groundbreaking science fiction, but it's made passable by the
special effects of the Jim Henson Company and Hallmark
Entertainment, both of which collaborated on such ambitious network
miniseries as ``Gulliver's Travels'' and ``The Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   Browder (``Party of Five'') plays John Crichton, an American
astronaut/scientist who gives new meaning to ``lost in space.'' In
Friday night's (March 19) premiere, a NASA experiment accidentally
sends him into a galaxy so far away that no one is ever bothered by
telemarketers selling AT&AMP;T long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   Small consolation. Crichton ends up in the middle of a galactic
war and ultimately aboard a living, breathing alien spaceship _
later in the season it will actually get pregnant _ with some
escaped prisoners and a stranded soldier named Aeryn Sun (Black).
</P>
<P>
   Although not a comedy, ``Farscape'' tries to pass along the
``Star Trek'' do-unto-others message with a lighter touch,
alternating between life-and-death moments and frothy quips from
Crichton. Example: While holding a couple of bad guys at bay with a
weapon completely unfamiliar to him, our hero says: ``Don't move or
I'll fill you full of little yellow bolts of light.''
</P>
<P>
   The tongue-in-cheekiness of ``Farscape'' is part of its appeal _
Crichton's name rhymes with that of the android Kryten from ``Red
Dwarf'' _ and sci-fi fans will no doubt find all sorts of homages
to other shows that have boldly gone before.

 &HT;    SENATE REJECTS EFFORT TO CONTROL TOBACCO MONEY
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate rejected an effort Thursday to force
states to spend at least half of their money from tobacco
settlements on health-related programs.
</P>
<P>
   The 71-29 vote came on an amendment by Rep. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., to the $1.9 billion supplemental appropriations bill now
being considered by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a right and obligation to say that some portion of
that money, that federal money, ought to go to health-related
obligations,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who led the effort
with Specter.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators argued that without their amendment, states
could use tobacco money for any purpose. They said at least half
should be specifically earmarked for health care and smoking
reduction programs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rep. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, attached an
amendment to the spending bill that would prevent the federal
government from claiming a share of state tobacco settlements. The
Clinton administration has taken the position that the federal
government is entitled to a portion of the money under the Medicaid
law.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of that position argued that the states fought and won
the legal battles and are entitled to spend the money as they
please.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to tell Texas how to spend its money, quit the
Senate, move to Texas ... and run for the state Legislature,'' said
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``The federal government needs to butt
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, the tobacco industry settled with the states,
agreeing to pay $40 billion over 25 years to settle four state
lawsuits, including Texas's, and an additional $206 billion in a
broader deal with the other 46 states.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced in January that he was instructing the Justice
Department to initiate a suit against the tobacco industry.

C'MON. MOVIEGOERS WON'T PAY TO SEE CLINT EASTWOOD MAKE LIKE THE
DALAI LAMA
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by ACTORS-REINVENTED) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After ``Speed'' made Sandra Bullock America's mid-'90s
sweetheart, the actress spent three years playing variations on
that plucky-woman-against-the-world role. Then in 1997, Bullock
became bored and tried to stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   First, Bullock tried to play romantic and ``serious'' as a World
War I nurse who falls for a young Ernest Hemingway in the flop ``In
Love and War''; then she starred in ``Speed 2: Cruise Control,''
one of the worst blockbusters of the decade. Bullock became an
annoying party girl in that sequel; she was still fighting the
world, but by stamping her feet on it as hard as she could.
</P>
<P>
   After last year's popular but calculated ``Hope Floats'' and the
uneven but entertaining ``Practical Magic,'' Bullock is stamping
her feet again in ``Forces of Nature,'' a forced romantic comedy
that opens Friday. ``Forces'' is loud and abrasive, but it will
probably have a good opening weekend because it shows Bullock as we
want to see her: playing, essentially, Sandra Bullock, albeit an
irritating version.
</P>
<P>
   If her last three movies are any indication, Bullock has learned
a sad truth about movies: There are stars, and there are actors,
and only rarely do the two meet. There are people we go to see
perform, and there are people such as Bullock we go to see because
of their personalities or looks: their beaming or impish smiles,
their cocky or terse one-liners, their effortless charm, even their
machismo. But for some stars, it's not enough that they're paid
millions of dollars and have the adulation of millions; they want
to prove that they can ``act.'' They don't understand how they can
be loved without being respected.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, more often than not, these stretches fail. Clint
Eastwood, also in a movie opening Friday (''True Crime'') learned
the hard way: After more than a decade of playing laconic action
heroes in spaghetti westerns and ``Dirty Harry'' movies, Eastwood
spent much of the late '70s and all of the 1980s trying to prove
that he could be something more, alternating a series of
self-mocking roles with his more traditional tough-guy persona.
</P>
<P>
   Only the tough-guy movies worked, and even then sporadically,
but Eastwood wouldn't settle down till 1992's ``Unforgiven,'' an
Oscar-winning movie that revised his image without parodying it.
He's back to growling and squinting, even in tear-jerkers such as
``The Bridges of Madison County,'' and among the few things that
work in the ludicrous ``True Crime'' are the occasional moments
when he all but spits his lines at the camera.
</P>
<P>
   We all get bored with our jobs, but few of us have the kind of
followings that these stars have, and when they change on us and it
doesn't work, it's like an act of betrayal. Even when an actor
gives a good change-of-pace performance, he risks alienating fans;
Kevin Costner gives one of his best performances as a prison
escapee in the Eastwood-directed ``A Perfect World,'' but the movie
did only middling well at the box office. Somehow, winning an Oscar
for directing ``Dances With Wolves'' and receiving good reviews for
``World'' convinced Costner that he's not a limited actor, leading
to annoyingly surly and mannered performances in ``Waterworld'' and
``The Postman.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Costner would even want to be surly onscreen is a mystery;
we like him best when he's having fun, as with his mischievously
sexy performances in ``Bull Durham'' and ``Tin Cup.'' Even in the
recent ``Message in a Bottle,'' where he's shut off and moody, he
at least cracks a smile and a few jokes. ``Message,'' which was
well-timed as a Valentine's weekend ``date movie,'' became a hit,
but darned if Costner's brooding side doesn't screw up the romance.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the roll call of stars who have attempted and failed to
stretch are Julia Roberts, trying her hardest not to be just a
pretty woman in ``Mary Reilly'' and ``Michael Collins''; those were
such misguided performances that many reviewers overreacted
positively when Roberts decided to be charming again in the
radically uneven ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' She's in the company
of such performers as Dennis Quaid, who shut off his cockiness and
devilish grin to play it dour in ``Flesh and Bone'' (which worked
in spite of itself) and ``SwitchBack'' (which was beyond
redemption). One of the pleasures of last summer's innocuous remake
of ``The Parent Trap'' was seeing Quaid smile again, and although
he lapsed back into glumness in the recent ``Playing by Heart,'' at
least he had a brief good time as a guy who enjoys telling lies to
strangers in bars.
</P>
<P>
   Change of pace also hasn't been good to Bruce Willis, who has
sulked through a series of movies during the past couple of years;
he hasn't been enjoyable to watch since the over-the-top sci-fi
weirdness of spring 1997's ``The Fifth Element.'' Well, he hasn't
in the movies, anyway; he stormed onto TV's ``Ally McBeal'' early
this year in an unbilled cameo as a sarcastic therapist, almost
unrecognizable in bad comb-over, bow tie and mismatched clothes.
His looks might have been camouflaged, but his attitude wasn't: It
was the return of the smart-aleckiness that made him a star in TV's
``Moonlighting'' and the movies' ``Die Hard.'' It made you wonder
where he'd been.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those actors would hate to be put in the company of a
rapper-actor or an immature comedian, but they could learn from a
couple of people: Will Smith, whose effortless charm has led to a
series of hits, even though he repeatedly plays himself; and Adam
Sandler, who has spent his past half-dozen movies looking like what
he is _ a goofy frat-boy type indulging himself in silly skits.
Sandler knows he'll never win an Oscar, and he doesn't care; he's
making $20 million a picture, and he probably never dreamed that
he'd be this popular. If a doofus like Sandler is smart enough to
know that that's all you need, why can't the more ``intelligent''
stars understand that?

MAKING IT: ACTORS WHO HAVE REINVENTED THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies ACTORS-TYPECASTING) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many stars have failed to make a successful transition to
respected actor, but a few have succeeded in reinventing
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   TOM HANKS: Here's a guy who started as a sitcom actor (''Bosom
Buddies''), and went on to a mixed-bag series of comedies
(''Splash'' being the best, ``Volunteers'' the worst) before
proving that he could act in ``Big.'' By 1993's ``Philadelphia,''
people were comparing him with James Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   SALLY FIELD: Another veteran of lightweight sitcoms (''Gidget,''
``The Flying Nun''), Field broke through in 1976 with a tour de
force performance as a woman with multiple personalities in TV's
``Sybil.'' Within 10 years, she would win two Best Actress Oscars,
for ``Norma Rae'' and ``Places in the Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   TOM CRUISE: Cruise separated himself from a series of
teen-oriented movies, teaming himself with more experienced stars
(Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman) and visionary directors (Oliver
Stone, Brian De Palma, Stanley Kubrick and, soon, Steven
Spielberg). By the time ``Jerry Maguire'' rolled around, even
longtime detractor Pauline Kael started to say nice things about
him.
</P>
<P>
   JODIE FOSTER: Foster has done such a good job of restyling
herself as an intelligent, somewhat aloof actress that people
almost forget that she once starred in such innocuous family movies
as ``Napoleon and Samantha'' and ``Freaky Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL J. FOX: Fox, another sitcom-bred actor, took risks,
giving good performances as a yuppie drug addict in ``Bright
Lights, Big City'' and a moralistic Vietnam soldier in ``Casualties
of War.'' The movies were box-office disappointments, though, and
Fox went back to where he came from: a sitcom, ABC's ``Spin City.''

WILL BUSH PULL OUT BIG GUNS FOR VOUCHERS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The eyes of the nation are focused upon Texas because the former
republic's Legislature stands poised to create the largest school
voucher program attempted by any state so far.
</P>
<P>
   That focus is intensified by the fact that the Lone Star State's
governor is the not-yet-officially-announced front-runner for the
2000 Republican presidential nomination. And George W. Bush said in
his State of the State oration in January that ``the time has come
to try a pilot voucher program.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush can't provide enough push to get the voucher legislation
passed, some in his party may begin to wonder if he really has what
it takes to spearhead a national GOP triumph. The governor,
therefore, most go all out to show his bona fides in the voucher
donnybrook that is about to occur in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   And that means that those who see the proposed voucher program
for the cynical deception that it is need to understand that this
is the Alamo as far as public education goes in Texas. They must do
their utmost to buy enough time to show some significant
improvement in the performance of the state's public schools, or
there will be no San Jacinto for those institutions.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the so-called pilot program came within an eyelash of
being passed in the 1997 session. The House deadlocked 68-68. The
governor's need to stand tall on the voucher issue for the national
audience could provide just the edge to get the pilot program
through this session.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot program, indeed. Whether it's the version proposed by
state Rep. Kent Grusendorf, R-Arlington, or that from state Sen.
Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, something in the neighborhood of 150,000
students would be involved, and the state's largest school
districts _ including Dallas' and Fort Worth's _ would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   During a five-year trial period, the so-called pilot programs
could siphon between $2 billion and $3 billion from the public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins' proposal would provide $4,000-per-year scholarships to
private schools only to poor children who failed the most recent
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test.
</P>
<P>
   Grusendorf's proposed legislation would allow up to 10 percent
of the students at low-performing campuses in the Houston, Dallas,
Fort Worth, Austin, El Paso, Northside (Bexar County) and San
Antonio school districts to receive scholarships equating to 80
percent of each district's per-pupil maintenance and operations
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The terms ``voucher'' and ``scholarship'' are used
interchangeably. And that is fitting because vouchers originally
were referred to as scholarships when Georgia enacted a law in the
'60s providing them for white children to attend private schools
instead of desegregated schools.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of the current voucher proposals, of course, would be
to exacerbate the resegregation of the public schools that has
occurred in Texas because of white flight to the suburbs and to
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Grusendorf's voucher plan has no income limits. And it would
obviously open the door for more white students to leave schools
with large or predominantly minority student populations.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins' plan appears more ``compassionate'' (in Bush's political
vernacular). But it is merely a way of getting the camel's nose
under the tent flap.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Texas' most savvy political prognosticators are now
saying that Bush's and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry's backing will assure
passage of voucher legislation despite strong opposition from
teacher organizations and others who might be loosely lumped under
the ``liberals'' umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   But those forecasters fail to take into account that this
radical idea, which amounts to taxpayer funding for a parallel
school system, is not embraced wholeheartedly by a considerable
number of conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable concern on the right about the state
giving money to private schools with the usual kind of strings
attached. In Bivins' bill, for example, the private schools that
take state vouchers will have to administer the TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   And private schools could find themselves burdened with the same
kinds of paperwork burdens, special programs and restrictions that
now distract public school teachers and administrators from their
primary mission.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's biggest challenge, therefore, may be to convince real
Texas conservatives that a voucher program can be fiscally
responsible without being excessively intrusive. And that might not
be easy.

HANDICAPPING THE OSCARS BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that the book is better than the
movie. It's the same _ almost _ with books about the Oscars, which
tend to be better than the Academy Awards telecast (for one thing,
the books don't have those awful production numbers).
</P>
<P>
   One new book, one updated one and one standby are on the market
this year. Here's a quick evaluation of the three|
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE TRIVIA BUFF
</P>
<P>
   ``The Envelope, Please: The Ultimate Academy Awards Trivia
Book,'' by Arnold Wayne Jones (Avon, $5.99): To be more precise,
this quick-read paperback by Dallas-based Jones, who has
contributed to The Met and the Dallas Observer, is for the
trivia-obsessed. Jones dissects everything into tiny little pieces,
often starting off with fascinating tidbits only to end up sounding
like the guy you want to escape at a party.
</P>
<P>
   Examples: Jones includes a quiz in every chapter (the questions
would be a lot tougher if the answers didn't immediately follow
them). A question about homosexual characters in movies has an
answer that's two pages long.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the trivia is fun to read, the best parts of
the books are the introductions to each chapter, which when taken
together form a capsule history of Hollywood. Points off, though,
for such easy-to-fix errors as listing the original Gloria's year
of release as 1988 _ the movie came out in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DISH
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards,''
by Mason Wiley and Damien Bona (Ballantine Books, $23): The only
thing wrong with this book is that it's in drastic need of an
update _ the last year covered is 1994. Wiley and Bona cover the
Oscars year by year, with each chapter following a strict but
entertaining structure: anticipation, nominations, the awards
ceremony, and its aftermath. There's also an extensive appendix of
nominees and winners, complete with a yearly ``Points of Interest''
guide to Oscars trivia.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's unauthorized, the guide isn't reverential toward
the Oscars _ but it isn't disdainful, either. In an irony-free
deadpan style, it reports on some of the more Spinal Tap-moments _
such as John Wayne leading a sing-along of ``You Ought to Be in
Pictures'' at the 1972 ceremony (the large group on stage only knew
the first two lines of the song). Of the books covered here, this
is the most exhaustive _ and the one most worth reading cover to
cover, even at nearly 1,000 pages of pre-appendix text.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU JUST LIKE TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES
</P>
<P>
   ``70 Years of the Oscar: The Official History of the Academy
Awards,'' by Robert Osborne (Abbe Mille Press, $65): Yes, that's a
steep price, but then this oversize volume is really a coffee-table
book. Osborne, the erudite host from Turner Classic Movies and the
academy's official historian, is not as concise in print as he is
on the air. This updated volume takes the Oscars decade by decade
with almost biblical reverence (''1988-1997: The Academy's Seventh
Decade''), and year by year, somewhat less pompously.
</P>
<P>
   Like you're gonna read the text, anyway. The photos are amazing,
from a winsome Janet Gaynor with the first Best Actress Oscar (for
a trio of 1927 movies) to the spectacle of hundreds of people
fleeing the big boat in a still from Titanic. Each chapter features
poster art from Best Picture winners, stills from nominated movies,
photos from the ceremony and, often, pictures of the production
numbers. The book is beautiful _ it's like a dessert so
well-presented that you feel guilty about eating it _ but it isn't
very deep.

   UNDATED _ .MDNM/The Oscars may carry clout, but they don't
always get it right. From the early days, when Mary Pickford bribed
voters with high tea at her estate, to the sympathy awards given to
oldsters Don Ameche and Jack Palance, here's a list of glaring
miscarriages of Oscar justice. By LARRY SWINDELL. Story has moved

   UNDATED _ Most people think of Michael Dell as one of the
wunderkinds of the personal computer business. Dell Computer Corp.,
launched from a dorm room at the University of Texas in 1983, has
grown into an industry powerhouse generating $18 billion in annual
revenues selling built-to-order PCs. In the process, the value of
the company's stock has risen faster than that of any other
publicly traded company during the past decade. What most people
are just beginning to realize, though, is that, unwittingly,
Michael Dell may well have been the Internet's first entrepreneur.

the former republic's Legislature stands poised to create the

focus is intensified by the fact that the Lone Star State's

as much as possible, and to see whether New England was as scenic

 &HT;    Must haves for spring
 &HT;    She's gotta have it
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 21.
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. sole searching
</P>
<P>
   Comfort is in, and so is the shoe that keeps you grounded. The
slide, with a lower heel or a thin wedge heel, leads the style
parade, followed by thongs, sandals and mules. Look for these shoes
in white, pastels, red or orange and all shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
   2. whiten up
</P>
<P>
   ``White is an instant mood booster,'' says Jill Hinson, a
fashion director for Nordstrom. Look for sheaths, shifts, A-line
shapes, drop and empire waists. ``It can project an image that's at
once innocent and urbane.''
</P>
<P>
   3. pretty in pink
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular shades this season is pink; it's
lighthearted and conjures up visions of all things feminine. For
warm weather, slip into a pink twin set, a halter-neck dress or a
rosy pink lipstick. Blend pink with black, gray or deep blue for
more impact.
</P>
<P>
   4. cropped and chic
</P>
<P>
   Pants with slim and wide legs are inching upward and come in a
slew of shortened styles. They range from Capris, which stop two to
three inches above the ankles, to below-the-knee pedal pushers, to
midcalf-length clam diggers. Wear them with short-sleeve camp
shirts, twin sweater sets, a peasant blouse or a simple white
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   5. neck and neck
</P>
<P>
   The romantic look of an illusion necklace _ also called a
floater _ is making waves this season. The necklace is made from
super-thin wire adorned with pearls, diamonds and beads that look
like they are floating in air. The look is perfect with sundresses,
evening gowns or V-neck sweaters.

</P>
<P>
   1. sport-utility shoes
</P>
<P>
   They're not entirely sporty, and not quite dressy either. But
these are still the new do-everything shoes. They're trendy,
comfortable, versatile and masculine. Some shoes were made for
walking . . . these were meant for much more.
</P>
<P>
   2. `upscale casual' outfit
</P>
<P>
   Stylish men don't have to wear suits everywhere. But when the
occasion allows for dressing down, that shouldn't mean dumbing down
your look. Having one coordinated, comfortable and classy look to
don on casual occasions is the wisest of buys.
</P>
<P>
   3 . tone-on-tone suitings
</P>
<P>
   The season's sharpest-dressed men will be the ones wearing
lightweight suits in paler shades of gray, blue and brown, with
shirts and ties in similar shades. Start with the suit, then find a
shirt in a matching tone. Finish off the look with a tie that binds
the outfit together.

 &HT;    The latest looks for kids this spirng and summer
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 21.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Style isn't about age, it's about attitude.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to children, there's no kidding around. Trends
mean everything. Most know what's hot and what's not years before
they're old enough to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, are parents down with it? The
crazy-carefree-cool looks this spring make it hard not to be.
</P>
<P>
   Grunge is washed out. Low-riding baggies have been slimmed down
and softly constructed. Tweety and his cartoon friends are
outnumbered by designer logos. And electrifying neon has fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   For girls, ``pastels are the only way to go. That's all we're
seeing,'' said Barbara Collins, personal shopping manager for
Macy's By Appointment at Lenox Square.
</P>
<P>
   Boys favor primary colors, and the all-American red, white and
blue rules.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the ground rules are defined, here's a look at what
some cool guys and girls will be sporting in Atlanta this season.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It's a girl thing: Capri or carpenter pants in denim, khaki or
plaid, with T-shirts and color-coordinated blouses. Cargo skirts
with drawstring waists are also the rage this spring, while
sundresses and shifts remain classic ``Hotlanta'' attire.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Boys to men: Cargo pants in khaki, navy or olive. Drawstring
shorts with pockets. Plaid Bermuda shorts. Knit V-neck vest
sweaters with T-shirts underneath. Logo T-shirts under plaid,
button-down shirts, worn open, for added style and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The layered look is very trendy, plus in Atlanta it's so
practical, because as the day gets hotter you can peel off the
layers,'' says Janet Myers, manager of Kids Wear Boys at Nordstrom
in Perimeter Mall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Special occasion: For her, dresses in any style paired with
straw hats, matching purses and white gloves (hey, it's a Southern
thing). For him, khaki pants, navy blue blazer and button-down
shirts in French blue, white or sky blue work anytime, anyplace.
For really special events, consider a tie and tailored suit like
Dad's. On hot days, a suit vest with a short- or long-sleeved shirt
and slacks will do.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Summer fun: The surfer look is in for boys, with trunks in
bold colors that stop just above the knee. Most guys wouldn't be
caught out of water these days in trunks that resemble underwear.
``Everyone still wants to be like Michael Jordan and wear long
shorts,'' says Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Tankinis are the thing for girls _ swimsuits consisting of tank
tops and bottoms that provide more coverage than the typical two
piece.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Vanities: Both boys and girls are sporting the Gilligan hat,
also known as the bucket hat _ a bucket-shaped hat with soft brim
like the one Bob Denver wore in the 1960s TV show ``Gilligan's
Island.'' Baseball caps are always in style for both sexes. Clear
plastic tote bags and big floppy hats are must-haves for her. And
wrap sunglasses for boys and girls still have it made in the shade.

 &HT;    Soft and pretty rules the night
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 21.
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes you simply have to dress down to dress up.
</P>
<P>
   And this spring, dressing for after-5 parties and galas takes on
a new look with something called evening sportswear. Think actress
Sharon Stone in the Gap turtleneck and full skirt she once wore to
the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Donna Karan refers to these clothes as ``the glamour of
comfort,'' meaning sportswear separates done in unexpected,
easy-to-wear fabric combinations. You could pair a twin set _
cotton cardigan plus camisole _ with a floaty tulle ankle-length
ballerina skirt. Or wear a simple cashmere tank with a body-hugging
crinkle silk skirt. The effect is pretty and romantic, especially
when the sweaters are in shades of pink, blue, yellow and lavender.
</P>
<P>
   Also a contender for top sweater honors is the shrug. This tiny
cropped cardigan, which stops right below the bustline, looks
newest in gray jersey fabric and paired with a strapless tube top.
Wear it with a taffeta skirt or narrow-cut silk Capri pants for a
decidedly '50s feel.
</P>
<P>
   Other luxe cardigans look as if they are knitted from cobwebs or
the finest of meshlike yarns. They can be worn over funky tanks
emblazoned with ethereal angels or simple camisoles. These sets are
the perfect toppers for evening trousers in black or white chiffon.

 &HT;    Light, bright are just right for spring
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 21.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spring arrives, and one guy takes the same work-wear route he
followed all winter long: dark suit, white shirt, maybe a splash of
color in his necktie.
</P>
<P>
   Another guy heralds spring's arrival by blazing a stylish new
trail: pale suit, a comparably colored shirt and maybe a tie of the
same shade . . . or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Who looks smarter? The latter lad, of course. Style-conscious
men realize that lightening up _ in terms of color, fabric and
attitude _ is the wiser way to dress for work.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas navy, brown, black and charcoal are the correct colors
for cold-weather career wear, the warm-weather season calls for
suits shaded light blue, tan, light gray and cream. Tropical-weight
wools, linens, seersuckers and cottons are the best materials for
keeping cool. And a lighthearted approach to pairing suits, shirts
and (maybe) ties is the sharpest, surest response to rising
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Dark is dull. Light is bright. Pick pale apparel to avoid
arriving for work looking uptight.

 &HT;    Flattering styles perfectly suited for every body
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 21.
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For most of us _ men and especially women _ finding
the right swimsuit is no day at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, designers have gotten more daring by
whittling one-piece suits into skintight little nothings. In doing
so, they've added more inner construction _ cleavage enhancers,
tummy control panels, bun lifters _ to make our abs, bottoms and
breasts look beach-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   And women are taking to these form-fitting one-piece suits like
ducks to water. The clean lines flatter most figures, and the suits
can be as revealing as bikinis, especially with high-cut legs, deep
V-necks and cutout backs and sides.
</P>
<P>
   Making Waves
</P>
<P>
   Before you hit the sand or surf, here's the skinny on the latest
trends:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The competitive edge: Look for tank suits with patches, racing
stripes, piping and color blocking. These are for serious swimmers
who like to combine fashion and function.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Flower power: Whether they're tropical hibiscus or smaller
daisy patterns, flowers are making a splash. Colors can be bold or
pastel pretty.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gray matters: Call it platinum or silver, this color is hot
for swimwear; it combines well with brights or pastels. Look for
shiny fabrics like satin or jersey.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Details, details: Look for strapless suits, sky prints with
clouds, embroidery touches, zippers and drawstring accents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Palette pleasers: In addition to gray, go for white, the other
hot neutral. For color, add any shade of pink, red or orange. The
whole blue family, from turquoise to deep ocean blue, is also
popular.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fast-moving fabrics: Quick-drying nylon/Lycra and comfy
cotton/Lycra blends give swimmers ease of movement.

 &HT;    Practical panache: `Utility chic' a look you can live with
 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for Sunday, March 21.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Winter weather's behind us, so shrug off that
``performance fleece.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's spring, get ready to embrace the next phase in
fashion's evolution: ``utility chic.''
</P>
<P>
   The utility chic look is comfortable, versatile, modern and
practical. It's the next step in a progression that began with the
widespread popularity of sportswear made from performance fabrics
and continued with the worldwide embrace of cargo pants.
</P>
<P>
   Utility chic styles emerged as the strongest trend during the
spring/summer '99 runway fashion shows, for good reason:
Everywhere, at every price level, the clothes we favor are the ones
that prove most useful.
</P>
<P>
   See how ornamentation's been steadily de-emphasized in favor of
simplicity. Observe the way truly stylish people do more with less.
</P>
<P>
   Notice how silhouettes get more streamlined despite the fact
that Americans are getting stouter. The two concepts seem
diametrically opposed. But designers worldwide prove _ with what
they're offering this season _ that they're attuned to our needs,
they acknowledge our burdens, they feel our pain.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to innovative fabric treatments and the design
world's collective nod to transitory lifestyles, people can wear
cashmere or leathers or synthetics or linens year-round. Now, the
same clothes you wear from 9 to 5 look appropriate from 5 until.
And, as spring's trendiest styles prove, shades of white, black and
gray look equally edgy.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, the shoes that used to look comfortable look
sharp. And, until further notice, utility features such as zippers
and drawstrings, Velcro and hoods and bags big enough to hold your
essentials are the bare necessities of a stylish life.
</P>
<P>
   Does the utility chic trend reek of novelty? Yes. Dressing this
way will take some getting used to. But, unlike most trends that
rise only to fade, utility chic's got staying power.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most logical style for the millennial age. With so many
other uncertainties facing us, at least this early glimpse at how
we'll likely dress in the future makes sense.
</P>

   ATLANTA _ Gray skies are going to clear up. So put on a happy
face. And if that doesn't get you in a spring mood, stock up on
some of the ``Have a Nice Day''-colored clothes in stores this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas last spring was the season of pastel twin sets and
sensible gray skirts and pants, this spring heralds widespread
acceptance of suits, dresses and separates in bold and bright
shades.
</P>
<P>
   Women needn't worry if they're wearing the right colors, because
this spring there are no wrong colors. Designers weren't limited to
producing clothes in any particular shade of pink, orange, red,
blue or yellow because advances in dyeing processes enable them to
mimic any color found in nature and invent some that are not.
</P>
<P>
   Spring's outburst of rich colors is a key aspect of the overall
femininization of the season's styles. And color complements the
one neutral shade _ gray _ that shows no sign of losing its place
as a wardrobe staple.
</P>
<P>
   It's reasonable to suspect that designers are flooding the
marketplace with color to counteract the pessimism that rises each
time the approaching millennium _ and the anticipated accompanying
Y2K glitches _ comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget your troubles . . . c'mon, get happy,'' seems to be the
designers' sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies who hate taking neutral stances on style should take
advantage of this mood swing; it's only a matter of time before
fashion's infatuation with color fades.

GEENA ELBOWS JOAN OUT OF PRE-OSCAR SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joan Rivers had every reason to trash Geena Davis, who'll be
seizing Rivers' pre-Oscars territory Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivers wasn't flexing her famous talons. In a telephone
interview, she turned each invitation to nastiness into a ``Who
cares?''
</P>
<P>
   Will Geena Davis be hosting a new, academy-sanctioned pre-Oscar
show on ABC _ horning in on Rivers' annual E! Entertainment cable
show?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares?'' barked Rivers. ``It's just the Academy Awards.
This is not the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And isn't this the Geena Davis who's been something of a fashion
Chernobyl in previous years, a prime morsel for a Rivers rip job?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares?'' repeated Rivers. ``Good luck to Geena Davis.
She's a tall girl. Let her have her day.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Davis will have her 30 minutes at 5 p.m. Sunday,
launching ABC's ``Sunday at the Oscars'' spectacle. The awards
ceremony, hosted by Whoopi Goldberg, will begin at 5:30.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' half hour will feature live interviews with movie stars
as they arrive at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, fashion coverage,
backstage glimpses and a ``road to the Oscars'' segment.
</P>
<P>
   The show is the property of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences. The academy apparently noted the success of other
pre-Oscars shows _ including the E! Entertainment program hosted by
Rivers and her daughter, Melissa _ and decided to grab the game
ball for itself.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, from 5 to 5:30 only the official pre-Oscars show
will have live camera access to the red carpet area to buttonhole
stars.
</P>
<P>
   So won't the academy be prohibiting those other shows from
capitalizing on Hollywood's big event?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's too bad,'' Robert Rehme, the academy's president,
said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   In other words: Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Joan and Melissa Rivers will still have their say Sunday on E!
Entertainment; their show will simply end 30 minutes earlier, at 5.
Their ``1999 Academy Award Pre-Show'' will be on from 3 to 5 p.m.,
as part of a daylong block of Oscars programming on E!
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Another annual pre-Oscars show also will have to douse the
lights at 5 p.m. Sunday in deference to the academy's new show on
ABC. That's ``An Evening at the Academy Awards,'' produced by the
ABC-owned KABC-TV in Los Angeles and syndicated to more than 50
cities in the United States and to Canada. It will air from 3:30
until 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Film critic Roger Ebert is back to host the show but with a new
partner. He'll be joined by Karen Duffy, a Revlon model and writer.
</P>
<P>
   That could be fun. This is the Ebert who, during the 1994
pre-Oscar show, stared down an arriving actress' plunging neckline
and blurted, ``I'm not a fashion expert, but I know what I like.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress whose, uh, instrument so appealed to Ebert that year
was none other than Geena Davis.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Davis is an Oscar winner herself, as supporting actress for
1988's ``The Accidental Tourist.'' Eleven years later, her film
career seems to have withered; perhaps Sunday's exposure can give
her a jump start.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Davis on the shock of winning an Academy Award:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in such a parallel universe. I have no concept how long
I spoke or what I said. I remember it was Melanie Griffith and Don
Johnson presenting it, and I was talking to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They handed it to me and I was saying, `Oh, your dress is so
pretty,' and `Oh, it's so nice to meet you, da-da-da.' And they
were kind of going, `Uh huh. Go _ go there.' And I started talking
and wandered away. I don't know. It was a different dimension that
I entered.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Davis will be ensconced in a specially designed set
inside the Chandler Pavilion. Another contributor, CNN Los
Angeles-based news anchor Jim Moret, will be reporting from outside
the building.
</P>
<P>
   Moret, said ABC spokesman Dan Duran, is on loan from CNN and,
for the night at least, will be employed by the motion picture
academy.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises a question. How can Moret work for an organization
that he and his CNN colleagues cover as journalists? Isn't that a
classic conflict of interest?
</P>
<P>
   That might require a more satisfactory answer than ``Who
cares?''
</P>
<P>
   Moret said he is being paid ``a nominal fee'' to work on the
program. He said that his participation was cleared through Richard
Kaplan, president of CNN/U.S., and that the academy is placing no
restrictions on the questions he asks.
</P>
<P>
   If CNN wants him to, Moret said, ``I have no problem waiving the
fee, it's that small.''
</P>
<P>
   Moret said he wanted to appear on the pre-Oscars broadcast
because the Academy Awards are ``the biggest single entertainment
event in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be a matter of appearances more than anything else. Moret
still appears to be making himself part of the industry he's
supposed to cover, and he's planning to accept payment for it from
the academy.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever said that appearances didn't count in show business.

 &HT;    In close combat with `Shakespeare,' Spielberg's war epic pushes
to front line in depiction of America at its heroic best
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 21.
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So what does the well-dressed and well-informed
Oscar-goer wear to tonight's Academy Awards? Combat boots or
Elizabethan ruffles?
</P>
<P>
   The gut says to go with the GI guys in ``Saving Private Ryan.''
Though the film's early shoo-in supremacy has been challenged by
the lovable, nomination-laden ``Shakespeare in Love'' (the leader
with 13 nods compared with ``Ryan's'' 11) and by Italy's
unpredictable dark horse ``Life Is Beautiful,'' Steven Spielberg's
World War II powerhouse remains the movie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It's a beautifully done film with a virtuoso sequence _ the
opening D-Day assault _ that's as memorable as anything we've seen
on screen since the invention of movies.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, ``Saving Private Ryan'' celebrates _ with
precious little sentimentality and a total absence of false
patriotism _ a time when being an American meant something heroic.
In a sense, Spielberg has given us a Joe DiMaggio of a movie, a
picture of our country and ourselves at our best. And as this
complex, identity-wrenched century draws to a close, Spielberg's
timing is eerily appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's pick for best picture: ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My pick: Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The also-rans: ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``Life Is Beautiful,''
``Elizabeth,'' ``The Thin Red Line.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other picks in major categories that might help
win your Oscar-party betting pool. Just don't bet the farm.
</P>
<P>
   ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   The usual prognosticator, the Screen Actors Guild Awards, went
with Roberto Benigni (``Life Is Beautiful''), while the critics
groups were all over the place. But maybe the Oscar voters will
realize that Benigni is just Robin Williams with an Italian accent.
And they gave Williams his award last year.
</P>
<P>
   My hopes are with Ian McKellen of ``Gods and Monsters,'' one of
the best actors of his generation. His portrayal of Hollywood
eccentric James Whale is both nuanced and courageous. Besides, he
was robbed more than a decade ago when the role of Salieri, which
he created onstage in ``Amadeus,'' went to F. Murray Abraham for
the film version. The Oscar back then went to Abraham, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's pick: McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My pick: Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The also-rans: Benigni, Tom Hanks (``Saving Private Ryan''),
Nick Nolte (``Affliction''), Edward Norton (``American History
X'').
</P>
<P>
   ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   The Elizabethan blondes _ ``Shakespeare in Love's'' Gwyneth
Paltrow and ``Elizabeth's'' Cate Blanchett _ could cancel each
other out. And Brazilian actress Fernanda Montenegro (``Central
Station'') may benefit from actors' mentality that her win can't
threaten their careers (though you could probably say the same
these days about two-time winner Meryl Streep, nominated this year
for ``One True Thing'').
</P>
<P>
   But the momentum seems to be with Paltrow, and considering that
she actually played four different roles in one movie _ and played
them all beautifully _ that's fine by me. Even though I personally
preferred the dramatic complexity offered by Blanchett.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's pick: Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My pick: Blanchett.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The also-rans: Montenegro, Streep, Emily Watson (``Hilary and
Jackie'').
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORTING ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   A real toughie, as usual. I once thought James Coburn
(``Affliction'') was a sure thing. Longevity and all that. But
memories have gotten shorter in Hollywood. So have careers.
</P>
<P>
   I think the Academy might lean toward Ed Harris (``The Truman
Show''). It's a way to honor an actor with an honorable body of
work _ remember ``Apollo 13,'' ``Places in the Heart'' and ``The
Right Stuff''? _ and to throw a bone to ``Truman'' (the film and
Jim Carrey were shut out of nominations).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's pick: Harris.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My pick: Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The also-rans: Coburn, Robert Duvall (``A Civil Action''),
Geoffrey Rush (``Shakespeare in Love''), Billy Bob Thornton (``A
Simple Plan'').
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORTING ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   The SAG Award went to Kathy Bates (``Primary Colors''), which
was something of a surprise considering how her movie tanked in
theaters. Oscar might go for her, too.
</P>
<P>
   And while I like Judi Dench (``Shakespeare in Love'') and Lynn
Redgrave (``Gods and Monsters''), Bates' performance is what
supporting work is all about. She gave ``Primary Colors'' its
secondhand soul.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's pick: Bates.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My pick: Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The also-rans: Dench, Redgrave, Brenda Blethyn (``Little
Voice''), Rachel Griffiths (``Hilary and Jackie'').
</P>
<P>
   DIRECTOR
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, the easy pick of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Directors Guild of America said Spielberg was the best. So
did a bunch of critics groups, the Golden Globes and the other
usual suspects. Plus, he deserves it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's pick: Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My pick: Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The also-rans: Roberto Benigni (``Life Is Beautiful''), John
Madden (``Shakespeare in Love''), Terrence Malick (``The Thin Red
Line''), Peter Weir (``The Truman Show'').
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN FILM
</P>
<P>
   Here's where Italy's Benigni gets his statue and chance to be
adorably _ how-you-say-in-English? _ gushy and effusive and so
wonderfully Mediterranean. Brazil's ``Central Station'' is still
the better film.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's pick: ``Life Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My pick: ``Central Station'' (or, even better, non-nominee
``The Celebration'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The also-rans: ``Children of Heaven'' (Iran), ``The
Grandfather'' (Spain), ``Tango'' (Argentina).
</P>
<P>
   ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY
</P>
<P>
   The script was the worst thing about ``Saving Private Ryan.''
Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful'' could pull an upset, but my
instincts say ``Shakespeare in Love.'' It's got distributor Miramax
waging a formidable Oscar campaign and Broad-
</P>
<P>
   way's Tom Stoppard (who co-wrote the screenplay with Marc
Norman).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's pick: ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My pick: ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The also-rans: ``Bulworth,'' ``Life Is Beautiful,'' ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   SCREENPLAY ADAPTATION
</P>
<P>
   The script was the worst thing about ``The Thin Red Line,''
while ``Gods and Monsters'' just doesn't have the clout. The
Writers Guild of America went with Scott Frank's terrific
adaptation of Elmore Leonard's ``Out of Sight.'' Oscar probably
will, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's pick: ``Out of Sight.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My pick: ``Gods and Monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The also-rans: ``Primary Colors,'' ``A Simple Plan,'' ``The
Thin Red Line.''
</P>
<P>
   COSTUME DESIGN
</P>
<P>
   Here's where ``Beloved'' makes its last-minute surge. Gotcha.
</P>
<P>
   The two Elizabethan films are a toss-up; both are gorgeous. I
prefer ``Elizabeth'' simply because it's the underdog. Academy
members will likely prefer ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's pick: ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My pick: ``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The also-rans: ``Beloved,'' ``Pleasantville,'' ``Velvet
Goldmine.''

 &HT;    Mini movie round up
 &HT;    By Steve Murray, Bob Longino, Eleanor Ringel Gillespie and Jill
Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``True Crime''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood, Isaiah Washington and James Woods.
Directed by Eastwood. Rated R for language and violence. 2 hours, 7
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Trial by ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``True Crime'' really is one. Producer-director-star Clint
Eastwood's ham-fisted, beat-the-clock mystery is so full of cliches
and accidental humor that it verges on self-parody. He plays a
philandering, alcoholic-workaholic newspaper reporter (gee, there's
a new character) convinced that a convicted murder (Isaiah
Washington) is innocent. The problem is, the guy is due to be
executed at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   As Eastwood tracks down increasingly arbitrary clues, the movie
veers from laughable depictions of newsroom life to mawkish scenes
of Washington bidding his family goodbye (actually, he's very good,
and so is Lisa Gay Hamilton as his wife). The film also gets jolts
of energy from Denis Leary and James Woods, and a wasted Diane
Venora as Eastwood's weary wife.
</P>
<P>
   The movie exposes what better scripts have hidden: Eastwood is
equally stiff as a director and actor. His scenes meander and veer
wildly in tone, and his movies dawdle past the two-hour mark for no
good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the issue of Eastwood, 68, wooing several women
young enough to be his granddaughters onscreen. The leering tone
outdoes Woody Allen, but at least Allen keeps his shirt on these
days.
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   ``The King and I''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Animated version of the 1956 Yul Brynner-Deborah Kerr musical
with songs from Rodgers and Hammerstein. Voiced by Miranda
Richardson and Martin Vidnovic. Directed by Richard Rich. Rated G.
1 hour, 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Kids will probably be charmed. For everybody else,
it's a puzzlement.
</P>
<P>
   They should have called it ``The King, His High-Five Slappin'
Panther and I.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Beauty and the Beast,'' Disney, never a slouch in the
'toon department, proved some time ago that animated musicals could
really be, well, something wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Now Richard Rich (``The Swan Princess'') has taken a brush and
made ``The King and I,'' the first animated feature based on a work
by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But does this second-rate animated King
of Siam really need to high-five the paw of his pet black leopard?
Is that the only way to lure the youngest of moviegoers into the
story of an English schoolteacher instructing a whip-smart Asian
ruler in the ways of mid-1800s worldly culture?
</P>
<P>
   Rich's heavy hand doesn't stop there. The king now has a hot-air
balloon to fly around in and to swoop into action when somebody's
about to drown. And Anna does warble ``I Whistle a Happy Tune,''
but it's to fend off a big, scary dragon.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Too much more.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, some folks learned nothing of Mister Rogers'
eloquent teachings: A happy tune by itself can calm and charm a
child.
</P>
<P>
   If children really need for ``The King and I's'' crown prince to
be a martial-arts expert in order to stay glued to the screen, we
might as well give up right now and declare Nintendo the winner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   ``Children of Heaven''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mohammad Amir Naji, Mir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare
Seddiqi. Written and directed by Majid Majidi. Unrated. 1 hour, 27
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The shoe fits.
</P>
<P>
   You can go see ``Children of Heaven'' intent on divining all
sorts of hidden messages in its tale of abject poverty, scary
authority figures and other aspects of Iranian life.
</P>
<P>
   But then you'd miss seeing a simpler, much more delightful story
about two children and one pair of pink shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Ali (Mir Farrokh Hashemian) accidentally loses his little sister
Zahra's (Bahare Seddiqi) shoes. Because their family is poor, they
fear their father's (Mohammad Amir Naji, a.k.a. the scary authority
figure) punishment. So they scheme to share Ali's battered sneakers
until a better solution comes along.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it does, in the form of a boys' footrace where
finishing third means winning snazzy new shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Will Ali place third or, worse, win?!
</P>
<P>
   The ending, much like the rest of this movie (an Oscar nominee
for foreign language film), is by turns touching, heartbreaking and
hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   With its subtitles and mostly child's-eye viewpoint, ``Children
of Heaven'' sometimes feels about as workmanlike as Ali's father,
in the family's one-room home, breaking a block of sugar into cubes
as a favor for the local mosque. But then he refuses to add even
one precious cube to his own tea (``It's not ours,'' he tells Zahra
solemnly), and suddenly it's all about the kind of dignity that
mainstream Hollywood rarely captures.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad message to divine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jill Vejnoska
</P>
<P>
   DOCUMENTARY
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Days''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   A documenary about the Holocaust. Directed by James Moll. Rated
PG-13 for extreme adult themes, including genocide. At Lefont
Plaza. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An extraordinary, small-scale history lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Editor's note: A full version of this review appeared in
Wednesday's Living section.
</P>
<P>
   Life isn't beautiful in ``The Last Days,'' a searingly memorable
documentary about five survivors of Hitler's Holocaust in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Prouced by Steven Spielberg and an Oscar nominee for best
documentary, this small-scale history lesson gains its impact
through its narrow focus: 438,000 Jews sent to the camps in six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inevitably, some of ``Last Days''' stories and footage
are familiar. There are the obscene piles of corpses, the walking
near-dead whose skeletal bodies chilled the Allied liberators who
discovered them, the appalling horror tales of ovens and showers.
Yet the film manages a unique focus by confining itself to one
small country and to five people who made it out alive _ less, as
they all point out, because of any resilience or resourcefulness on
their part than because they were lucky. Very lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The movie says a kind of kaddish for the dead Jews of Hungary,
and it does so with respect, with honor and, oddly enough, with a
kind of undiminished hope.
</P>
<P>
   They should have called it ``The King, His High-Five Slappin'
Panther and I.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Beauty and the Beast,'' Disney, never a slouch in the
'toon department, proved some time ago that animated musicals could
really be, well, something wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Now Richard Rich (``The Swan Princess'') has taken a brush and
made ``The King and I,'' the first animated feature based on a work
by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But does this second-rate animated King
of Siam really need to high-five the paw of his pet black leopard?
Is that the only way to lure the youngest of moviegoers into the
story of an English schoolteacher instructing a whip-smart Asian
ruler in the ways of mid-1800s worldly culture?
</P>
<P>
   Rich's heavy hand doesn't stop there. This king's now got a hot
air balloon to fly around in and to swoop into action when
somebody's about to drown. And Anna does warble ``I Whistle a Happy
Tune,'' but it's to fend off a big, scary dragon.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Too much more.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, some folks learned nothing of Mister Rogers'
eloquent teachings: A happy tune by itself can calm and charm a
child.
</P>
<P>
   If kids really need ``The King and I's'' crown prince to be a
martial-arts expert in order to stay glued to the screen, we might
as well give up and declare Nintendo the winner right now.

 &HT;    Oscar records could be in the stars tonight
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 21.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' made Oscar history last year, tying ``Ben-Hur'' for
the most Oscars ever won _ 11.
</P>
<P>
   It's less likely history will again be rewritten tonight, but
there are plenty of possibilities among the nominations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bigger than ``Titanic''? _ Technically, both ``Saving Private
Ryan'' (with 11 nominations) and ``Shakespeare in Love'' (with 13
nods) could match ``Titanic's'' feat. ``Shakespeare'' could win
enough to become Oscar's winningest film of all time. Just don't
count on it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The actor factor _ A Tom Hanks victory for ``Saving Private
Ryan'' would be the first time a male performer has won three
trophies in the top acting category. Hanks already has Oscars for
``Forrest Gump'' and ``Philadelphia.'' Jack Nicholson has three
Oscars _ for ``As Good as It Gets,'' ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest'' and ``Terms of Endearment, '' but the first two were for
lead actor and the last was a supporting trophy. In Oscar's early
years, Walter Brennan won three trophies, all in the supporting
category. Katharine Hepburn, of course, is the all-time acting
leader with four best actress Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It would be a wonderful ``Life'' _ ``Life Is Beautiful'' could
become the first foreign film ever to win best picture. Plus,
Roberto Benigni is up for three Oscars for best actor, director and
screenplay. No one has ever swept those categories.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The big sweep _ Speaking of foreign language films, four of
the top categories could go to non-English speaking movies if
``Life'' takes best picture, actor and director and ``Central
Station's'' Fernanda Montenegro wins the best actress category.
That would be a first.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  They're playing his song _ Lurking in the music categories are
three separate nominations for music by Randy Newman: best song
(``That'll Do'' from ``Babe: Pig in the City''), dramatic score
(``Pleasantville'') and musical or comedy score (``A Bug's Life'').
In 1973, Marvin Hamlisch scored an Oscar music hat trick, winning
the same three categories for his work on ``The Way We Were'' and
``The Sting.''
</P>
<P>
   BALLOT STUFFINGS
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few nominees who've already won accolades from
various guilds and critics groups:

Film Critics, actor.

AIRLINE PASSENGER BILLS WOULD BOOST FARES, INDUSTRY ARGUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: FILED in ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legislation that would impose consumer-oriented
rules on the nation's airlines drew fire Thursday from industry
officials, who said the new rules would boost airfares.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks several key lawmakers have introduced so-called
``passenger bill of rights'' legislation that would, among other
things, require airlines to give customers accurate information
about why flights are delayed.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal, by House Transportation Chairman Bud Shuster,
R-Pa., would require airlines to reimburse passengers if they are
kept waiting on the ground for more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Robert P. Warren, senior vice president for the Air Transport
Association of America, which represents large U.S. airlines, told
Shuster's Aviation Subcommittee that the industry is working to
voluntarily improve its customer service and does not need Congress
to impose new rules.
</P>
<P>
   He said the various measures would ``result in higher fares,
fewer seats available, fewer seats available at lower fares and
confusing requirements and additional pressures on our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hirst, a senior vice president for Northwest Airlines,
said in written testimony that the proposals would ``produce
unintended and highly undesirable consequences including raising
air fares.'' He also said he was concerned that safety might be
compromised if airline employees felt pressured to get planes in
the air to avoid monetary penalties for long delays.
</P>
<P>
   In the past Democratic lawmakers have offered bills aimed at
improving airline customer service, but now several Republicans
have jumped on the issue after hearing reports of airline
passengers being forced to sit on airport runways up to nine hours
during a January snowstorm in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster said Thursday he decided to introduce his bill when he
realized that long runway delays are not an isolated event. More
than 3,600 planes sat on the ground for more than two hours last
year, according to the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot go through a day where people aren't coming up and
telling my their horror stories,'' Shuster said. ``I hope the
airlines won't have their heads in the sand and can appreciate that
this is a really serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week the House panel heard from passengers who were
involved in long delays in Detroit and other places. At Thursday's
hearing, airline industry officials gave their views.
</P>
<P>
   Hirst apologized for the Detroit incident and explained why the
airline was unable to get 30 planes to the airport's gates.
Instead, they were forced to sit on the runway for several hours
after landing.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem, he said, was that 68 empty airplanes were
snowed in at the gates and in airfield areas nearby and were thus
blocking the incoming planes. He said airline and airport workers
believed they would be able to move the snowed-in airplanes before
the incoming flights landed but were unable to do so because of the
fierce storm.
</P>
<P>
   Warren repeated industry suggestions that Congress focus on
improving the nation's air traffic control system rather than
imposing new regulations on airlines. He noted that most delays are
mandated by air traffic controllers. The government's General
Accounting Office has long advocated that the computers running the
air traffic control system be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John E. Sweeney, R-N.Y., said, ``It strikes me that the
industry itself is in great depths of denial, that everything is
going well and it's somebody else's fault.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week the Clinton administration proposed legislation and in
addition issued Department of Transportation regulations that
include many of the provisions contained in House and Senate
airline bills.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional proposals would require airlines, upon
request, to disclose the number of seats on a flight that are
reserved for frequent flyer awards and it would allow passengers to
use any portion of a ticket without penalty. This would end airline
restrictions on passengers who find they can save money by buying
two inexpensive round-trip tickets and then using one segment of
each ticket for such a trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would require airlines to hold a reservation for
48 hours at the same price, giving people time to comparison-shop.
Passengers are often told they must book a flight immediately to
secure a particular price.

telling my their horror stories,'' Shuster said. ``I hope the
airlines won't have their heads in the sand and can appreciate that
this is a really serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week the House panel heard from passengers who were
involved in long delays in Detroit and other places. At Thursday's
hearing, airline industry officials gave their views.
</P>
<P>
   Hirst apologized for the Detroit incident and explained why the
airline was unable to get 30 planes to the airport's gates.
Instead, they were forced to sit on the runway for several hours
after landing.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem, he said, was that 68 empty airplanes were
snowed in at the gates and in airfield areas nearby and were thus
blocking the incoming planes. He said airline and airport workers
believed they would be able to move the snowed-in airplanes before
the incoming flights landed but were unable to do so because of the
fierce storm.
</P>
<P>
   Warren repeated industry suggestions that Congress focus on
improving the nation's air traffic control system rather than
imposing new regulations on airlines. He noted that most delays are
mandated by air traffic controllers. The government's General
Accounting Office has long advocated that the computers running the
air traffic control system be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John E. Sweeney, R-N.Y., said, ``It strikes me that the
industry itself is in great depths of denial, that everything is
going well and it's somebody else's fault.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week the Clinton administration proposed legislation and in
addition issued Department of Transportation regulations that
include many of the provisions contained in House and Senate
airline bills.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional proposals would require airlines, upon
request, to disclose the number of seats on a flight that are
reserved for frequent flyer awards and it would allow passengers to
use any portion of a ticket without penalty. This would end airline
restrictions on passengers who find they can save money by buying
two inexpensive round-trip tickets and then using one segment of
each ticket for such a trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would require airlines to hold a reservation for
48 hours at the same price, giving people time to comparison-shop.
Passengers are often told they must book a flight immediately to
secure a particular price.

 &HT;    Wild cat refuge considering haven in Atlanta
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Facing mounting legal problems with officials in Roane
County, Tenn., the operators of a big-cat sanctuary have won an
apparent reprieve from the prospect of trying to find a new home
for their 65 lions, tigers and other exotic felines.
</P>
<P>
   But the operators of Tiger Haven say they likely will move
anyway, possibly to metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent action in a two-year zoning fight over the
nationally known refuge for abused wild cats 40 miles west of
Knoxville, the Roane County Planning Commission voted narrowly 4-3
to rezone the 10-acre sanctuary site to permit the keeping of
dangerous animals.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, a county judge found that Tiger Haven violated
the county's zoning ordiance. The judge also upheld the county's
decision last year to deny Tiger Haven permission to rezone 30
adjacent acres for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need more room to spread,'' says Joe Parker, who
along with his wife, Mary Lynn, founded Tiger Haven. ``We still
hope to move. This just give us time to make an intelligent decison
on where and when to move.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is far from settled, however, as the county commission
must approve the rezoning recommendation of the planning panel. It
was the county board that sued the Parkers for noncompliance with
the zoning ordinance last year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the zoning battle over Tiger Haven has bitterly split
the eastern Tennessee county between those who fear the cats as a
threat to their community and those who contend the felines are the
only ones threatened. ``I think the ideal place would be 50 miles
north of Atlanta,'' says Parker, a fomer bingo operator who once
used bingo proceeds to support Tiger Haven. ``We've already gotten
a lot of support from the Atlanta area.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past seven years, the Parkers have provided a home for
unwanted and abused exotic felines in a rural neighborhood near the
small town of Kingston. Most of the animals are discarded pets or
rescued animals from abusive road-side zoos.
</P>
<P>
   While the Parkers have won praise from Tennessee wildlife
authorities, the Roane County Humane Society and other animal
advocates, some of their neighbors contend they are a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents express fears that one of the cats might escape and
attack them or their children. They also say the compound, which is
visible from narrow Harvey Road, has depressed property values.
Other complaints center around concerns that fecal waste is
contaminating streams and ground water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't anti-animal,'' argues Juanita Raymer, who lives near
the sanctuary. ``We just don't think it's the right place for it.
There are 26 families on that little road. We just feel like Mr.
Parker should follow the rules just like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Haven began in 1991 as a home for one tiger and slowly
grew to more than 50 animals by 1997. The Parkers say they have
never had an escape.The tract is encircled with an 8-foot high
perimeter fence, while the pens are enclosed with a 16-foot high
chain link fence.
</P>
<P>
   And a number of neighbors support Tiger Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's a wonderful place,'' says Alma Carter, a
next-door neighbor who volunteers at Tiger Haven. ``The county
should be proud of it. It's the best-maintained, cleanest animal
facility I've ever seen.

DEAN MOSS: SWINGING SHADOWS AND DANCING GHOSTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ghosts from several worlds and times inhabit Dean
Moss' new ``Spooky Action at a Distance,'' performed on Wednesday
night at the Kitchen. Most immediate are the ghosts embodied by
Moss and his dancers, Kacie Chang and Marcelo Coutinho. Fred
Astaire is seen as clearly, on a television monitor, putting on
blackface for his ``shadow'' dance with Bill (Bojangles) Robinson
in ``Swing Time,'' an inspiration for the piece.
</P>
<P>
   The next layer of ghosts includes a large silver creature,
dressed in a stiff black net suit, that hangs over the shadowy
half-lives unfolding below. In the furthest reaches of this
universe are film images of dancers projected on the black back
wall, as insubstantial as wisps of smoke. Crowding in around them
are wisps of another sort: bits of 1930s-era popular music and
music by African composers, and excerpts from the writings of Noam
Chomsky, Richard Feynman and David Ruelle, some of them about
quantum physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spooky Action at a Distance'' is probably not for those who
like dance with a strong center. Moss' images fly off like sparks
from a non-existent torch, creating a moment's glimpse of the
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Moss also is not interested in delivering gut-wrenchingly plain
messages about society. Instead, the black dancer and choreographer
puts on the black suit and slips in and out of a solo that draws on
the kind of eccentric capering that came to represent slave dancing
and a generation of black performers in Hollywood film, including
stars like Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tale Telling Telling,'' a 1997 solo choreographed and
performed by Moss to music by Kevin Volans, is less subtle but just
as ghostly. Its central image, of a black man in a dark suit that
becomes dusty with white chalk powder, is powerful.
</P>
<P>
   David Fritz designed the lighting for the program. The stylishly
insubstantial costumes for ``Spooky Action at a Distance'' were by
Gia Grosso and Leah Chalfen.

FIREWORKS   ARTISTS GET TOGETHER TO DISCUSS THEIR CRAFT 
</HEADLINE>

1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   INGLIS, Fla. _ They rarely advertise, yet most are already
booked up past New Year's Day 2000. They freely share their trade
secrets, but only with people who figure out how to contact them.
Some of their favorite merchandise have names like Red Thousand
Coconut.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of the pyrotechnic artist.
</P>
<P>
   The medium? Fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I got into this because I was always the little boy
who wanted to play with matches,'' said Fred Partin, a member of
the Florida Pyrotechnic Art Guild.
</P>
<P>
   Partin was among the 200 or so who gathered last weekend for the
guild's annual spring meeting, which was held at a campground near
Inglis. The experience of these guild members ranged from
first-year beginners to full-time professionals, but they share a
common desire for privacy. They don't announce the times and
locations of their meetings because they don't want to attract a
crowd as they learn and experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These get-togethers and our competitions in the fall are a
chance for us to help each other and learn from each other,'' said
Partin's wife, Lee Partin. Together the Partins operate
Dragonworks, a business based in Homosassa Springs, Fla., that
displays fireworks, including specialty items they design and
manufacture for use in competitions with other guild members.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we got into 10 years ago and today I think
of it as a serious hobby,'' said Fred Partin.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Partin is considered a grand master in the guild and teaches
the course required to be certified in pyrotechnics. She also has
developed recipes for making striking displays.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Partin said her experience working with and teaching the
formulation of pottery glazes gave her a knowledge of chemistry
that she has used in pyrotechnics. Her biggest fireworks show last
year was a $70,000 extravaganza in Lancaster, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   While the Partins consider pyrotechnics a fascinating hobby,
Mark Ferguson says fireworks are the only way he ever wants to make
a living.
</P>
<P>
   He runs a business called Pyrobros in Crystal River, Fla., that
imports, exports, distributes and displays pyrotechnics. He can
readily explain the cryptic names given by Chinese manufacturers to
fireworks. For example, The Red Thousand Coconut: It's 12 inches
across, costs $60 and bursts into glorious color after 12 seconds
of upward thrust.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the year Ferguson and a staff of about a half dozen
employees can handle the details involved with shipping fireworks
to 48 states and six countries, plus putting on 100 or so shows.
But come July and December, his staff significantly increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the Fourth of July, we'll probably employ 80 people for
our various shows,'' Ferguson said. ``We could have at least that
many working for us New Year's Eve because we already have shows
booked for Seattle and Boston and Tampa and a city in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks haven't changed much in recent years, but the way they
are shot off has changed dramatically. Fuses used to be lighted by
hand but now electronic systems are used. Operators at large shows
use computer systems that choreograph displays.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said a pyrotechnician will know _ based on the fuse
length, size, type and manufacturer _ how many seconds each display
item will take to go off. To choreograph a show, fuses need to be
lighted from five to 15 seconds ahead of key parts of a piece of
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we enter into the computer all that information and the
computer can figure out when each item should be lit,'' Ferguson
said. Pyrobros now uses four computer systems, each worth at least
$10,000, to choreograph its shows.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Guild members do not need a computer to know they must have 70
feet of clearance from a crowd for every inch of shell. That means
a 3-inch shell must be fired at least 210 feet away from the
nearest spectator.
</P>
<P>
   Those standards are set by the National Fireworks Protection
Association. Additional standards are set by the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms. The federal agencies track the
movement of all fireworks coming in, going out and moving around
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the part I least enjoy _ the paperwork and having to
account for every single shell,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting ready for a show can be tricky without a safe place to
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we have meets,'' Fred Partin said. ``They create an
environment for people to exchange information and a place to try
out new things that have made.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really stress the importance of safety,'' said Lee Partin.
</P>
<P>
   Several guild members have had accidents that could have been
life-threatening. Ferguson and his brother were both blown off a
barge into the water when they were hand lighting a show several
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my mom probably worries a little bit because when I
first started doing this, she would ask me all the time, `Why don't
you get a real job?' '' Ferguson said. ``But now that my company is
doing 100 shows a year, she is starting to think this is pretty
cool.''

THE GUGGENHEIM SOUNDS THE ALARM: IT AIN'T NECESSARILY SO 
</HEADLINE>
  (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The Giant,'' a black-and-white photo-collage that
Cindy Sherman made in 1976, is the unsung center of the Guggenheim
Museum's exhibition of its brand new photography collection.
</P>
<P>
   In the piece, a collage of sequential black-and-white
self-portraits, cut out and arranged in a long line, Ms. Sherman
appears as a lumberjack in a wool cap, flannel shirt, jeans, thick
socks and boots. If the collage is viewed like a slow-motion movie
or flip book, the young woodcutter in glasses slouches with hands
on hips, slowly straightens up, looks at the camera, snaps her
suspenders, looks down, puts her hands back on her hips, takes her
hat off, looks at the camera again, puts her cap on her head and
finally bows her head and ducks behind the next to last Cindy in
line.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways ``The Giant'' is an exception in the exhibition,
``Photography: An Expanded View.'' It is a collage; there are only
a few in the show. It is a proto-video; there is only one video. It
is a self-portrait; there are no others evident. But ``The Giant,''
made when Ms. Sherman was only 22, even younger than most of the
young photographers in this show, is its soul. It is central
because it inaugurates, quite innocently, a climate of visual
distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giant'' foreshadows Ms. Sherman's Untitled Film Stills,
frames of movies that never were, starring Ms. Sherman as every
movie star who ever was. (In this exhibition there are two Film
Stills, one of a Gidget-like figure in the big city, the other of a
showgirl in heels sitting on a window ledge.)
</P>
<P>
   By creating seemingly factual documents of nonexistent fiction
and insuring that they were excruciatingly exact, Ms. Sherman made
everything unbelievable. She seemed to say: Don't ever believe your
eyes. Now her lesson has been thoroughly absorbed by younger
photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the work of Reneke Dijkstra. In this show there are
three giant beach portraits taken against three different backdrops
of puke green or pale blue sky: one in Coney Island, one in Poland,
one in Odessa, Ukraine. Into each seascape, an awkward giant or two
has fallen. In Coney Island a girl in a black suit stands with one
hand clenched, one ankle braceleted. She looks cold, bare, small
and large against the sky and sea.
</P>
<P>
   In Poland two boys are in their underwear. One stands straight
with his hands held behind him. The other is contrapposto, with his
hands on his thighs, and he squints. In Odessa a skinny pale boy in
a red suit stands, hip jutting. The space between his arm and his
body looks vast. These photographs are so painfully real and large
and colorful that they look, well, impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for a pair of Roni Horn iris prints of an owl.
White and gripping a brown branch against a white background, the
owl looks alive and well, but the viewer knows better. The label
says ``Dead Owl.'' And of course the two prints are identical. Or
maybe not. One owl appears to be a little fatter. Maybe it was shot
from a slightly different angle. No, maybe not. Once again, the
message is: Don't believe your eyes. These owls must be different
because they are identical. They must be dead because they look
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Demand's photograph almost provides relief from the
pervasive disbelief, if only because it is obvious that he has
fabricated the scene. ``Archive,'' a C-print of a storage room, is,
on closer inspection, a fake that doesn't even try to conceal
itself. It is a giant photograph of a tiny model of a stockroom,
filled with identical boxes tucked in identical cubbyholes,
accessible by a toy steel ladder.
</P>
<P>
   If the storeroom is fictional, what about James Casebere's
``Asylum,'' a photograph of a concrete floor and a slab of
concrete, a bed, that floats above it? Is it a real asylum, a fake
prison, a monk's cell or none of the above? And what about the huge
C-print of the Japanese stock exchange by Andreas Gursky?
</P>
<P>
   Surely this vast sea of red, turquoise and yellow jackets
serving Money, the queen bee, cannot be real. Miles Coolidge's
C-print of a street corner with a flimsy police station, a
terrifying Kids ``R'' Us store and a pathetic McDonald's looks like
a plaything. So probably it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This show indicates that there is an unofficial law for the
eyes: Anything that looks real must be doubted, and anything that
declares its artifice _ by garish color, size, blurriness, fakiness
_ is automatically more trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Consider two blurry prints, acrylic lacquer on canvas, by Uta
Barth. They have absolutely nothing in focus. But one doesn't think
for a second that they represent something that never was. They are
clearly real street scenes because they are blurry. One strains to
see reality because the photographer has made it a challenge. Are
those the headlights of a car? And what's that white blur? A
street?
</P>
<P>
   The second Barth print, also blurry and dreamlike, with blotches
of blue, pink and yellow, appears to be an image of some
storefronts. There's no doubt here that nothing is fabricated. It's
just blurry.
</P>
<P>
   How different this climate of visual distrust is from the school
of reality represented by George Platt Lynes and Robert
Mapplethorpe. The only kind of fictional frisson one gets with
these is an occasional goof of attribution: ``I didn't know
Mapplethorpe did that! Oh, it's by George Platt Lynes. They are so
much alike! I didn't know Mapplethorpe got so much from Lynes. I
didn't know the Guggenheim had so many of both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are too many photographs by Mapplethorpe (22) and by Lynes
(24) in this exhibition, which was financed by the Robert
Mapplethorpe Foundation. But they do provide a nice foil for the
newer photographs. The Mapplethorpe and Lynes portraits don't doubt
their own reality or even raise a question about it.
</P>
<P>
   They present their figures as part of a super-real,
super-classical race. These are great bodies, great artists, great
celebrities, and like statues they are more real and cast bigger
shadows than you or I. They are utterly out of place in a gallery
of visual distrust.
</P>
<P>
   Josef Albers' photographs from 1929 and 1930 hang better with
the newer photographs. His crisp, clear picture of a clothesline
with the wind filling its dresses, shirts and undies and his
photo-collage of Mrs. Lewandowski in her beach wear both seem to
anticipate by 70 years the idea that the strangest things, the most
ad hoc, seem most reliable to the eye.
</P>
<P>
   An inadvertent gloss on the exhibition is added in ``Exile
Brands,'' a series of portraits of Havana cigars by Andrea Robbins
and Max Becher. Each photograph shows two cigars that go by the
same name. The only difference is that one of each pair is made in
Havana and the other is not.
</P>
<P>
   So which one is authentic? You immediately think it's the one
from Havana. But think again. As Ms. Robbins and Becher point out,
many Havana cigar makers left Havana and took their businesses and
names with them. So the exile brand is arguably more authentic.
</P>
<P>
   The wall text reads, ``Which version of a classic brand is more
`authentic' depends on whether one places more importance on
continuity of soil and location or on family and country
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar question can be asked of photographs: Which is more
authentic, the one that flaunts its unreality or the one that
pretends to be real? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Photography: An Expanded View, Recent Acquisitions,'' remains
at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, through May 16.

MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM POSES TECHNICAL CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the House on Thursday overwhelmingly approved
a futuristic system to guard against limited missile attack, such a
weapon is fraught with technical hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and lawmakers are planning a system
that relies on ground-based interceptors to shoot down incoming
enemy intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in the outer
reaches of the Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The program, known as National Missile Defense, is designed to
hit a few missiles sent aloft by Iraq, Iran, North Korea _
countries the United States brands as rogue nations _ or a single
ICBM accidentally launched by Russia or China.
</P>
<P>
   The effort has been in the research and development phase for
several years. The House voted 317-105 Thursday to deploy such a
system, while the Senate approved it 97-3 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While technically challenging, National Missile Defense is a
scaled-back version of what Ronald Reagan envisioned in 1983, with
lasers and rockets parked in space intercepting thousands of Soviet
nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan called the project the Strategic Defense Initiative, or
SDI, and critics _ mainly Democrats _ dubbed it ``Star Wars.'' SDI
never came to fruition in large part due to the technical setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   No final decision has been made on deploying National Missile
Defense. Instead, the Clinton administration has set June 2000 as
the deadline to make the call on whether to take the concept out of
the laboratory and build a functioning system. The goal would be to
have it in place by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The final cost could top $38.5 billion, according to
congressional estimates, and could climb much higher depending on
the number of interceptors and launch sites.
</P>
<P>
   But a decision to deploy would turn in part on whether the
Pentagon can achieve the technological breakthroughs required for
this complex system of advanced sensors, radars and missiles to
actually work.
</P>
<P>
   The major concern is that given current technology, it may
simply be too difficult to track and destroy an enemy missile
traveling several times the speed of sound and them to blow it up
by ramming it with another missile _ all in the span of several
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pentagon plans, the concept would employ four main
components, according to the Ballistic Missile Defense Office, the
Pentagon agency responsible for managing the effort:
</P>
<P>
   _ Space- and ground-based sensors to provide early warning of
attacking missiles;
</P>
<P>
   _ Ground-based radars to track the threatening warheads;
</P>
<P>
   _ Ground-based missile interceptors based in North Dakota and
possibly Alaska to collide with and destroy enemy warheads; and
</P>
<P>
   _ A battle management system that would link all the components
with military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the Pentagon has not had much success with the
concept.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Gen. Larry Welch, in a report released by the
Pentagon last year, warned that the National Missile Defense
program was ``highly unlikely'' to succeed because it lacks
coherence and a realistic plan. The report accused Pentagon
managers of a ``rush to failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch's report found that of 17 tests conducted by the Pentagon
since 1982 of ``hit to kill'' interceptors, only four, or 23
percent, actually struck their targets. Welch found that of the 14
tests directed against high-altitude targets _ an ICBM is
considered such a target _ only two hit their targets for a 14
percent success rate.
</P>
<P>
   Since the report, the Pentagon conducted another test against a
high-altitude target. It also failed.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the congressional investigative
arm, last year said the administration's plan involved ``high
technical risk.'' For example, the GAO said the weapon that would
ram into an incoming missile, called the exoatmospheric kill
vehicle, is considered ``one of the most technically challenging
components of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cirincione, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, an advocacy group in Washington, asserted
that the technical challenges are insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to design an effective ballistic missile
defense system,'' he said. ``What we are talking about is hitting a
bullet with a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirincione added that an enemy intent on striking the United
States with missiles could overwhelm such a system with missile
decoys, the same strategy NATO planned to use against the Soviet
Union during the Cold War.

<P>
   TAYEGLU, Somalia _ It took three days _ and one gun battle _ for
the ratty caravan of trucks, piled with sacks of corn, to arrive
here from a port near Mogadishu. When there is little rain, food is
like money, and this caravan was guarded by no fewer than 132 young
toughs with machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who is looting,'' said convoy leader Daahir Abdulleh
Ali, 49, ``you kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least shoot at them. No one died in this particular
firefight, but three people, along with several cows, were hurt. In
Somalia, the cycle of food and fighting churns on, after three
years of drought, floods and failed crops, along with the hope
these days that normal rains will finally fall and make life
easier.
</P>
<P>
   But there are differences now from five years ago, when the
United Nations ended its famine relief mission here and the name
Somalia became a one-word explanation of why so many outsiders were
giving up hope on Africa. Certainly after 18 U.S. Rangers were
killed here in 1993, U.S. policy in Africa became largely one of
striving to avoid another disaster of human deprivation where it
might have to send troops.
</P>
<P>
   With most aid agencies gone, and clan warfare continuing in the
only nation in the world with no central government, Somalia has
been left largely on its own, for good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   A recent appeal to outside governments for half a million
dollars in seeds _ a child's allowance in the multibillion-dollar
aid industry _ has gone largely ignored. The World Food Program, a
U.N. agency that has been organizing food deliveries to parched
parts of the south, is warning that another failed harvest, through
lack of rain or seed, could bring on another severe famine, six
years after the one that killed some 300,000 people. Somalia's
population is roughly 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   But skepticism about investing in Somalia _ and skepticism in
general of aid agencies always warning of the next disaster _ runs
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has had a bad experience in Somalia,'' said a
European aid official in Kenya, who insisted on anonymity. ``If
there is already international donor fatigue for Africa, it is even
worse for Somalia.''
</P>
<P>
   And so aid agencies have been turning more to programs that
involve Somalis directly and are claiming some success. CARE
International, for example, has trained some 40 local groups, often
associated with the clans, to carry out relief projects, including
distributing food in small quantities that do not make such
tempting targets to militia groups.
</P>
<P>
   Abdi Yussef, chairman of Soma-Action, one of the most respected
Somali non-government organizations, acknowledged a criticism of
these local groups: that some had been created merely for profit
and are too close to the local powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jokingly, someone will tell you when he wants to start a
business, `I am bringing up an NGO,' '' he said. But in recent
years, he said, this has been less of a problem because so little
money now flows into Somalia. And looters, he said, have been less
likely to steal food from local groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a part and parcel of the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the World Food Program, saying it
learned from the mistakes of the early 1990s, has completely
reworked the way it delivers food. In November it began delivering
food to southern Somalia, mostly to the Bay and Bakool regions in
the south, where fighting and water shortages have uprooted some
34,000 people in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency does not deliver the food itself. Rather, it
contracts Somali businessmen, who rent trucks, hire gunmen and put
up a bond equal to the worth of the food.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, the convoy leader, said he and his partners had to provide
a $1.5 million deposit on the 370 metric tons of corn they
delivered from Mogadishu to here to Hoddur to the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the maize is stolen or we are attacked, I have to go out
and buy the same maize,'' Ali said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials say the program has worked well because
contractors are docked for whatever food they do not deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay a premium for that,'' Steve Gluning, chief security
officer for the World Food Program in Somalia, said as aid workers
distributed food in the town of Bardera, on the Juba River in the
south. ``All the onus is put on the trader to get the food from
point A to point B, and he loses if he fails. Yes, he may have to
fight his way through. But it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   There is much contention among aid workers about just how bad
the situation is in southern Somalia. The World Food Program has
not called it a famine but says the situation is one more failed
harvest away from disaster, and now is a critical time because it
is both when the rains come and the summer crop is planted.
</P>
<P>
   Both here and in Bardera, people said they had walked many miles
to find water and, in some cases, to escape fighting. They said
they were hungry, but no one seemed to be starving, in part because
aid is arriving.
</P>
<P>
   But the Somalis themselves are finding ways to cope beyond what
outsiders bring them.
</P>
<P>
   In Bardera, Habiibo Salaad, 40, stood under the broiling sun as
an aid worker scooped out 20 cupfuls of corn for her and her family
of 11 people. This should last two weeks. But she and her family
have been collecting firewood and fetching water to sell at the
market. It is just enough to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The rains are supposed to start there soon, and there has been
some rain already in southern Somalia. If enough rain falls, Mrs.
Salaad said, the family will walk back to their farm, nearly 20
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect Allah will give us rain,'' she said. ``Otherwise, we
will be in bad shape.''

GOP LAWMAKERS COME UP WITH PLAN TO RAISE SALARIES FOR TEACHERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Senate Republicans on Thursday said they've
devised a $2.5 billion plan to give most Texas public-school
teachers a $2,000 pay raise in 2000, increase their retirement
benefits and provide homeowners a small measure of property-tax
relief _ all without violating court orders governing
school-finance equity.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide voter approval of a constitutional amendment would be
required in November to implement the strategy, whose linchpin is a
proposed $1 billion state contribution to individual teachers'
retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   By reducing retirement-related deductions on teachers'
paychecks, their take-home pay will increase an average of $2,006 a
year, lawmakers said, adding that teachers with above-average
salaries would see a bigger increase and those with below-average
salaries would get smaller increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does get the money where Texans want it to go _ in the
pockets of school teachers,'' said Senate Education Committee
Chairman Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Months in the making, his measure, Senate Bill 4, was endorsed
by Lt. Gov. Rick Perry and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bill
Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, while Senate and House Democrats reacted
cautiously to the multipronged proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps this is a beginning point,'' said Sen. Gonzalo
Barrientos, D-Austin.
</P>
<P>
   A major concern is whether the plan will appease rank-and-file
teachers that have been pleading for a $6,000 annual pay boost.
Another lingering question is whether homeowners' tax relief will
be sufficient to allow Gov. George W. Bush to declare he
successfully delivered on one of his biggest 1998 re-election
campaign promises _ a $2 billion ad-valorem property-tax reduction
made possible by at least $2.5 billion in surplus income.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wasn't the only political figure who advocated property-tax
cuts along with higher teacher pay, and Bivins said his plan gives
colleagues an opportunity to fulfill their 1998 campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally everybody that ran for statewide office and the
Legislature said that education was their No. 1 priority, and
filing SB 4 today, I plan to hold them to that promise,'' Bivins
said.
</P>
<P>
   He described the legislation as a ``work in progress'' that is
likely to undergo bipartisan-backed improvements as it makes its
way through the committee process in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rob Junell, D-San
Angelo, said Bivins' proposal ``is one of a number of good ideas''
that will be considered by the House. Even so, the House Public
Education Committee has not decided what approach it wants to take
to deliver promised teacher pay raises, and the House Ways and
Means Committee is mulling numerous property-tax relief measures _
all made possible by rosy surplus predictions for the fiscal year
ending Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   As filed, Bivins' plan provides $1 billion to replace teachers'
contributions to the Teacher Retirement System; increases the
crucial TRS ``multiplier'' from 2 to 2.1; and lowers
school-district property-tax rates by an average 10 cents
statewide, at a cost approaching $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The multiplier is part of a formula used to determine retired
teachers' standard monthly annuities. Currently, the annuity is 2
percent, times the average of the three highest annual salaries,
times years of credited services, divided by 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan is a triple play,'' said Perry, who presides over
the Senate, by ``increasing education funding, improving teacher
pay by 6 percent and cutting property taxes significantly all at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation demonstrates what Gov. Bush, Teel Bivins and
Rick Perry have been saying for a long time _ our No. 1 priority is
our children's education,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Bivins' package ``represents the largest single
increase in school funding in the history of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, who devised the strategy to circumvent an equity
squabble, said an across-the-board teacher pay raise would not have
been possible under ``Edgewood'' equalization rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would inevitably wind up sending money to wealthy school
districts. When we do that, we fly in the face of the Edgewood
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, even if more monies were factored into existing
school-funding formulas, poorer districts might not have the cash
to deliver the mandated across-the-board raises, Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   His plan entails removing a constitutional provision that
requires teachers to contribute no less than 6 percent of their
salaries to the retirement system. Currently, teachers contribute
6.4 percent, with the state adding 6 percent. The Constitution also
would have to be amended to remove a 10 percent cap on the state
contribution, Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state picks up the entire 6.4 percent that is now paid
by the teacher, it's a raise by virtue of the fact that the
teachers get to keep it in their pocket,'' Ratliff said. ``We're
able to get it to every teacher, all across the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not as much as some people were promising during the
campaigns, but I'm sure that everybody understands that's not
possible,'' Ratliff said.

   TRADE-REPORT (Washington) _ As U.S. exports continued to fall,
the U.S. trade deficit jumped to a new monthly record of $17
billion in January, fueled by a flood of imports from China that
could stir further protectionist sentiments in Congress. Among the
imports that surged into the United States from China was a huge
increase in steel, and the protectionist movement may gain momentum
now that China joins Japan, Brazil and Russia on the list of
nations pouring inexpensive steel into the U.S. market. By David E.

officials have repeatedly said they really don't want to carry out.

   RUSSIA-LOANS (Washington) _ Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told

   NY-DIALLO-PROTESTS (New York) _ Protesters of the shooting here

   GUN-SAFETY (Undated) _ When a semiautomatic's magazine is
removed, a round can remain in the chamber, ready to be fired, and
scores of people have died or been seriously hurt in recent years
as a result. Gun producers have long known of the danger, and some
responded by building into their guns an inexpensive mechanism
known as a magazine safety. But the fact that many gun makers have
chosen not to use simple devices like magazine safeties and gun
locks is now a focus of a growing wave of lawsuits in which cities
are accusing the firearms industry of making guns needlessly
dangerous. By Barry Meier.

   ANTIDEPRESSANTS (Undated) _ The new generation of antidepressant
drugs, of which Prozac was the first, is not any less _ or any more

The report puts to rest lingering doubts about the relative
effectiveness of the new drugs, but it also notes that there is

treat mild depression, a condition for which they are widely
prescribed. By Erica Goode.

 &HT;    CONDITIONS IN NURSING HOMES MAY BE WORSENING
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A quarter of the nation's nursing homes have severe
health and safety infractions that often go unpunished, although
the conditions jeopardize residents, federal auditors said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Their study concluded that federally mandated surveys of the
nation's 17,000 nursing homes indicate conditions have not improved
_ and may have worsened _ since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating on problem nursing homes in four states, the
report found that fines were rarely collected and sanctions were
usually blocked by appeals that took years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is not doing enough,'' said Sen. Charles
Grassley (R-Iowa) chairman of the Senate Special Committee on
Aging, as he released the study, which was conducted by the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients suffer and taxpayers are suckers,'' he said. He cited
one case in which a nursing home resident wandered off and was
found days later, stabbed to death. ``The nursing home had never
reported the person missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas had some of the worst cases in the study, which cited one
chain that had 72 civil fines imposed on it totalling more than
$4.1 million. Yet the chain, identified by state and federal
officials as Texas Health Enterprises, Inc., has paid only
$120,000, according to logs provided by the Texas Department of
Human Services. The rest of the penalties, involving at least 62
cases going back to 1995, have been appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The largest chain in the state, Texas Health Enterprises owned
about 11 percent of its nursing homes during the period of the
study, but accounted for more than 18 percent of enforcement
actions for health and safety infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, problems with the Texas-based chain extended to
Michigan, where six of its facilities were the targets of 27
separate enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Moors, a spokesman for Texas Health Enterprises, had no
immediate comment on the findings.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office survey, which also looked at
California and Pennsylvania, found enforcement of regulations to be
lax throughout. Nursing homes frequently corrected problems to
escape fines, only to be cited for the same violation later in what
the report called a ``yo-yo'' effect.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the study cited an unidentified Texas home that was
cut off from Medicare payments for six months after a string of
violations. Five months after payments resumed, state surveyors
found new problems, including bed sores and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of sanctions appeared to have little effect,'' said
the report, in part because of a backlog of some 700 cases in the
appeals process that must be completed before penalties are
collected.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the critical report, the Health Care Financing
Administration, which regulates nursing homes, announced earlier
this week that it would toughen penalties and direct states to
speed up investigations of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   California, Michigan and Pennsylvania have endorsed the GAO
findings and promised to cooperate. Texas has offered no formal
response.

Rosemary Patterson, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Human

said that nursing home companies ``pocket profits and then put
money into political action committees and lobby the government.''

THE GOVERNMENT SHUT-DOWN REMEMBERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You'd think the Republicans would have the grace to
be embarrassed about their pivotal role in twice shutting down the
federal government, creating the shocking political crisis that
helped reelect President Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of sensibly trying to forget it, the Republican
National Committee in its wisdom is sending out fund-raising
letters seeking to blame Clinton for that budget debacle. The RNC
denounces what it calls the ``Clinton-Gore shutdown strategy'' that
it predicts will lead to another government collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians frequently try to rewrite history to make themselves
look good, but this is silly. The public memory may be short, but
it's not totally blotto.
</P>
<P>
   The government was closed for six days in November 1995 and for
21 days beginning on Dec. 15 of that year. Because the conservative
House refused to compromise over conflicting policy goals, Congress
was unable to agree on how to keep paying the federal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Remember House Speaker Newt Gingrich conceding that he forced
the shutdown because he was piqued after the president didn't speak
to him during a diplomatic trip on Air Force One and forced him to
exit at the rear of the plane? He told reporters he was so miffed
``that is part of why you ended up with us sending down a tougher
interim spending bill'' that he knew the president could not
accept.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's outburst was featured in the national television
newscasts and produced a memorable New York Daily News headline,
``Crybaby,'' accompanied by a caricature of the speaker in diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans also rushed to take credit for the standoff,
cheering the fact that federal workers were unpaid and public
services disrupted, including the processing of passports and
Social Security papers. Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, then a GOP
presidential hopeful, chortled in an ABC interview: ``Have you
missed the government? Doesn't it strike you funny that 280,000
government employees are furloughed, large segments of the
government are shut down?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the GOP, it didn't strike voters as funny at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The White House pressed for a settlement and so did both Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole and Minority Leader Tom Daschle. ``I
believe the White House, and I certainly believe the Democratic
leader, would like to see this thing ended,'' Dole observed after a
two-week layoff, pointedly failing to mention his Republican House
colleagues. Daschle was more blunt: ``The House wants
confrontation, not solutions,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   The country got the message, and the Republicans got the blame.
When the polls showed the GOP suffering over the issue and in
danger of losing congressional control in 1996, Gingrich and his
dogmatic troops finally backed down.
</P>
<P>
   But RNC spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick now says disingenuously, ``Our
party certainly takes issue with the fact that the president seems
to be disavowing any responsibility ... when it was his veto power
that led to the government shutdown in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsk, tsk. That naughty Clinton actually had the gall to use the
constitutional tool the Founding Fathers gave the president to help
keep the three branches of government co-equal and the legislature
in check. Under Fitzpatrick's unique theory of governing, the
executive branch is apparently supposed to automatically capitulate
to a Congress that insists on having its own way regardless of
potentially draconian consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had warned in advance that he would veto an
appropriations bill that went too far in cutting domestic programs.
The House deliberately ignored that in passing Gingrich's
``tougher'' measure. It was a game of chicken, and the president
refused to sacrifice his own budget goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans underestimated Clinton, not for the first time.
They thought that the ``train wreck'' they eagerly engineered would
help their cause. Instead voters saw it as the same old partisan
gridlock they had hoped to end when they tossed out the
congressional Democratic majority and substituted GOP control in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   To remind voters of this sorry scenario would not seem to be in
the best interests of the Republican Party. Surely there are more
credible ways the RNC can pummel Clinton.

 &HT;    CONDITIONS IN NURSING HOMES MAY BE WORSENING
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A quarter of the nation's nursing homes have severe
health and safety infractions that often go unpunished, although
the conditions jeopardize residents, federal auditors said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Their study concluded that federally mandated surveys of the
nation's 17,000 nursing homes indicate conditions have not improved
_ and may have worsened _ since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating on problem nursing homes in four states, the
report found that fines were rarely collected and sanctions were
usually blocked by appeals that took years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is not doing enough,'' said Sen. Charles
Grassley (R-Iowa) chairman of the Senate Special Committee on
Aging, as he released the study, which was conducted by the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients suffer and taxpayers are suckers,'' he said. He cited
one case in which a nursing home resident wandered off and was
found days later, stabbed to death. ``The nursing home had never
reported the person missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas had some of the worst cases in the study, which cited one
chain that had 72 civil fines imposed on it totalling more than
$4.1 million. Yet the chain, identified by state and federal
officials as Texas Health Enterprises, Inc., has paid only
$120,000, according to logs provided by the Texas Department of
Human Services. The rest of the penalties, involving at least 62
cases going back to 1995, have been appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The largest chain in the state, Texas Health Enterprises owned
about 11 percent of its nursing homes during the period of the
study, but accounted for more than 18 percent of enforcement
actions for health and safety infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, problems with the Texas-based chain extended to
Michigan, where six of its facilities were the targets of 27
separate enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Moors, a spokesman for Texas Health Enterprises, had no
immediate comment on the findings.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office survey, which also looked at
California and Pennsylvania, found enforcement of regulations to be
lax throughout. Nursing homes frequently corrected problems to
escape fines, only to be cited for the same violation later in what
the report called a ``yo-yo'' effect.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the study cited an unidentified Texas home that was
cut off from Medicare payments for six months after a string of
violations. Five months after payments resumed, state surveyors
found new problems, including bed sores and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of sanctions appeared to have little effect,'' said
the report, in part because of a backlog of some 700 cases in the
appeals process that must be completed before penalties are
collected.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the critical report, the Health Care Financing
Administration, which regulates nursing homes, announced earlier
this week that it would toughen penalties and direct states to
speed up investigations of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   California, Michigan and Pennsylvania have endorsed the GAO
findings and promised to cooperate. Texas has offered no formal
response.

   ``We're working on a system'' to improve nursing home care, said
Rosemary Patterson, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Human

RUSSIA'S POLITICAL INTRIGUE NOW HAS A SEX SCANDAL, COMPLETE WITH
VIDEOTAPE  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As the focus of Russia's latest political scandal
shifted from corruption to sex, President Boris Yeltsin appointed a
special commission Thursday to investigate the making and
distribution of a videotape that showed Russia's top prosecutor in
bed naked with two young women.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who was discharged Thursday from a Moscow hospital
after a three-week stay, held an early morning meeting with Yuri I.
Skuratov, the embattled prosecutor who just Wednesday mounted a
political challenge to Yeltsin by refusing to keep a promise to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov, who had a lackluster record during his three and half
years as chief prosecutor, resigned on Feb. 1 for what he said were
health reasons. His resignation was promptly accepted by Yeltsin,
but on Wednesday it was defiantly rejected by the Federation
Council, or the upper house of parliament, which under the
constitution must give its consent.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not clear whether Yeltsin will again ask the
Federation Council to approve the resignation, or whether he is
hoping that Skuratov will offer to quit again on his own.
</P>
<P>
   After his morning meeting with Yeltsin, with Prime Minister
Yevgeni M. Primakov present, Skuratov kept a low profile through
the day, as his supporters picked their way through the thorny
moral and legal issues posed by the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The film clip, a few minutes of which were aired late at night
on the government television channel, is now at the center of a
debate over who has sunk lower in the Russian public's esteem _ the
government for using unauthenticated and vaguely pornographic
material as a political weapon, or its chief prosecutor for setting
a bad moral example.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Skvydkoy, head of the government radio and television
committee, justified the showing of the film on the ground that
Skuratov had violated the moral standards of his office, and opened
himself up to blackmail. He said the tape had come from an
anonymous source, and that after last night's showing, the Kremlin
had asked him not to show it again.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov has claimed that the film was part of a blackmail
attempt to stop him from investigating political corruption cases.
``This is the result of a thoroughly planned provocation carried
out in connection with a criminal case being investigated by me,''
said the prosecutor in a telephone interview with a Russian
television reporter, given as he drove to his 8 a.m. appointment
with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Although the existence of the tape was widely known, and copies
had been distributed to television stations and parliament, its
broadcast seems to have dampened the enthusiasm of some of
Yeltsin's political enemies to make Skuratov the hero of an
anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecutor is going to whores, and only whores,'' said
Aleksandr Lebed, the governor of Krasnoyarsk and former
presidential contender. ``Yesterday the wedge was driven between
the president and the prosecutor, the president and the Federation
Council. Now the prosecutor will have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov's most faithful supporters were the leaders of Russia's
Communist Party who doggedly defended Skuratov's right to a private
life. ``We have fallen so low,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, a top
Communist party leader and parliamentary deputy. `'We compromise a
highly skilled lawyer by showing him in some bed, having found no
other argument for his dismissal.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor has already said that he will sue the Russian
state television channel for violating his rights to privacy, but
legal experts said Thursday that while Skuratov may have a case,
the law could cut both ways.
</P>
<P>
   If the women were prostitutes, he may have broken the law, some
noted. There is also the matter of the oath he took on taking
office, to be a ``paragon of moral purity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues to be clarified by the special commission are
the origins of the videotape _ reported in one newspaper Thursday
to be 51 minutes long _ and who first brought it to Skuratov's
attention, and why. The commission, which includes members of the
Federation Council, will be headed by Yeltsin's chief of staff,
Nikolai Bordyuzha, and includes the interior minister and the head
of the Federal Security Service.

COLLECTING VINTAGE MILITARY VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Collectors of vintage military vehicles can
drive around with all the bravado of Gen. George Patton, confident
that the objects of their affection were built to last. After all,
going to war is the ultimate in endurance testing.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that these vehicles are not full of creature
comforts. ``If you have a choice between the highway and
cross-country, go cross-country,'' goes a joke passed among Jeep
owners. ``It'll take the same length of time and the ride's
better.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can leave your vehicles out in any weather, and any time
you stop for gas or wait for a parade to start, you hear stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 8,500 members, our club's not all that big compared to
some,'' said Kay Willard-Hinga, manager of the Military Vehicle
Preservation Society, based in Independence, Mo. ``But the vehicles
do stand out.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Greenberg's certainly do. The Portland tree surgeon has a
1944 DUKW amphibious truck that looms more than 8 feet above the
highway. At the top is a replica .50-caliber machine gun (which
cost $600, about one-tenth the price of the real thing). The DUKW,
or ``Duck,'' is 31 feet long and weighs 14,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It has pumps on board to raise tire pressures from 10 pounds for
driving on sand to 40 on the highway. (The intermediate 30-pound
setting was used for landing on coral reefs in the Pacific.) It
reaches 55 miles an hour on the road and 10 knots on water.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg has owned the Duck since 1991 and admits to splashing
into the Columbia River when he has an excuse, ``like with a troop
of Boy Scouts the other weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   As impractical as these half-century-old craft may seem, there
has been a resurgence of interest in them; entrepreneurs are using
survivors of the 22,000 war-era Ducks to ferry paying passengers
into lakes and rivers, headed for spots inaccessible by road. ``I
know there's one in Seattle, another in D.C., one in Branson, Mo.,
and one in Chicago,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Duck may seem an apt name for these amphibious vehicles, but
DUKW was actually their production code. D was for 1942, U for
amphibious, K for two driven rear axles and W for a driven front
axle.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for World War II armor are marching upward. Greenberg,
41, paid $7,500 for his Duck, ``and there was one sold in a
magazine for $35,000 recently.''
</P>
<P>
   His interest in military vehicles began in high school in the
'70s when he bought a Dodge Power Wagon pickup dating from World
War II. ``It had the wrong motor _ a big V8,'' he said. ``But I'd
go camping in it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he became a tree surgeon, he found a '44 Chevrolet 6-by-6 _
a six-wheeled truck with six-wheel drive _ worked fine.
</P>
<P>
   But most collectors get started with Jeeps. Battered '40s models
still show up in rural newspaper advertisements (``Good hunting
rig'') for less than $1,000, but Greenberg dived into Jeep history.
By 1991, when Jeep celebrated its 50th anniversary, he owned one of
each of three prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   American Bantam, Willys-Overland and Ford had all bid on the
original government contract for a light scouting vehicle. The name
``Jeep'' came from ``GP,'' for general-purpose vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The designs were similar, with four-cylinder flathead engines,
three-speed transmissions and open, four-seat bodies. Bantam was
the successful bidder, but was too small to deliver the quantity
the Army needed. So the best ideas were added to the Willys design;
Ford and Willys shared production.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 600,000 Jeeps were built in 1941-45. Willys made
368,000 and Ford the balance. Tiny Bantam built only 2,675 units,
which went to England on lend-lease.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg bought a Bantam Jeep in pieces in Boise, Idaho, and
found a Ford version on a side street here. He no longer has his
Willys prototype (one of six survivors out of 1,600 built) _ it
went to a friend in England who desperately wanted one.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Greenberg's other vehicles include a wheeled 1942 White M3A1
scout car (more often found as a half-track, with conventional
wheels in front and tank tracks at the rear), a 1942
Harley-Davidson military police tricycle, and an unusual 1940 Dodge
VC1 command car prototype with a ``toast rack body'' _ that is,
lacking doors. Of 2,155 command cars made, it is one of 15
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   He belongs to the Military Vehicle Collectors Club of Oregon.
Its 148 members own many Jeeps and Dodge trucks, 11 Ducks, four
scout cars, three half-tracks and two tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Does he ever think of buying a tank?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it costs $50,000 to $70,000 for a restored Sherman tank,''
Greenberg said. ``And then you have to buy a transporter. You can't
exactly drive it on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   His Duck, however, is not just street legal, with a license
plate and added-on turn signals; it is river legal. Greenberg
obtained an Oregon boat license for it.
</P>
<P>
   American collectors tend to want American vehicles. It's mostly
a matter of familiarity, not because collectors served in the
military. ``Not a lot of our members are veterans,'' Ms.
Willard-Hinga said. ``People get interested as a father-son thing.
And there are the stories. They participate in parades and the
vehicles always spark stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet collapse and new access to Eastern Europe haven't
changed the market much. ``Some groups collect foreign vehicles,''
Greenberg said, ``but it's hard to find parts for Russian tanks in
the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   A collector car has been defined as ``one you rode in the back
seat of between the age of 5 and 15'' _ which explains why
progressively newer cars are restored. Does a similar rule apply to
military vehicles? ``It does,'' Greenberg said. ``People are
collecting Korean War vehicles, Vietnam and even Desert Storm
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Most military vehicles in the hands of American collectors were
sold directly to the public and never left the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Antique vehicles still accompany veterans on sentimental
journeys overseas. ``A number of our guys went back to Normandy in
1994 for the D-Day anniversary,'' Ms. Willard-Hinga said. ``They
shipped their vehicles and left them over there with friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Like fondly remembered comrades, the trusty machines never came
back.

SENATE OPPOSES PLAN FORCING STATES TO SPEND TOBACCO FUNDS ON HEALTH
PROGRAMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting up a confrontation with the Clinton
administration, the Senate on Thursday rebuffed an effort to force
states to spend at least half of the money from tobacco settlements
on smoking and health programs.
</P>
<P>
   By a 71-29 vote, the Senate rejected the amendment, which two
lawmakers had sought to attach to a $1.9 billion emergency spending
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued the federal government should not be mandating
to states, which initiated the lawsuits against the tobacco
companies, how to spend billions of dollars in settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents responded that since the tobacco settlements involved
Medicaid, a federally funded program, Congress had a right to
dictate how some of the money should be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest skirmish over how to spend the tobacco funds may well
be academic in Texas, where a $17 billion settlement with the
tobacco companies already stipulates that most of the money be
spent on health and smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Texas' two Republican senators argued for the
principle of state's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to tell Texas how to spend its money, quit the
Senate, move to Texas ... and run for the state Legislature,'' said
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``The federal government needs to butt
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said ``this is state money,
it is not federal money.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the amendment ensured that a provision crafted by
Hutchison that would bar the federal government from recouping any
of the tobacco settlement money will remain in the Senate's
emergency spending measure.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration officials have argued that the
federal government does have the right to some of the money or at
least to dictate how it is spent because the basis of the state
lawsuits was that tobacco-related illnesses had pushed up Medicaid
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government funds, on average, about 57 percent of
the costs of Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor.
In Texas, the federal government pays for 62.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote was the latest battle in the ongoing struggle
over how the government should be compensated for treating those
who suffered from tobacco related illness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 tobacco companies, besieged by state lawsuits, offered
to pay out $368 billion to settle those suits. That triggered a
yearlong debate in Congress that culminated in Senate Republicans
killing an administration backed plan that would have extracted
$516 billion from tobacco companies in the form of higher cigarette
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Congressional failure to reach a national
settlement, a majority of states negotiated on their own with
tobacco companies. Forty-six states have agreed to accept $206
billion from tobacco companies over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But governors and federal officials have continued to tangle
over whether the federal government should have a share of the
settlement funds.
</P>
<P>
   The failed amendment offered by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa, and
Tom Harken, D-Iowa, was intended as a compromise between the White
House and the governors.
</P>
<P>
   It would have allowed the states to keep the tobacco money but
would have mandated that half of it be spend on health-related
programs. Under the proposal, 20 percent of the tobacco funds would
have to be spent for smoker cessation programs and 30 percent for
public health.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said some states have been proposing to use the tobacco
money for such purposes as highways, mental health programs, debt
reduction and to increase teacher pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Republican said that while he believed that
``the federal government should not micromanage the use of the
funds, I am not prepared to turn all of this money over to the
states carte blanche to use on matters unrelated to tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   The rejection of the compromise is likely to set up a fight with
the White House. In a letter to Specter, Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala stated the administration's ``strong
opposition'' to the Hutchison provision prohibiting any federal
control over the tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
   She said that under the Texas Republicans' plan, ``states would
not have to spend a single penny of tobacco settlement funds to
reduce youth smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala, however, said the White House would be willing to work
with Congress on an alternative approach that would ensure that
funds are used to reduce smoking and ``for other shared and
national priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   An HHS spokeswoman said that the president's advisers have
recommended that Clinton veto the emergency spending bill if it
contains the Hutchison provision barring any federal role in the
tobacco money. However, the spokeswoman said the administration was
willing to accept the compromise crafted by Specter and Harkin.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency spending bill would primarily fund a relief effort
for Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch.

better than the 3.2-liter, 6-cylinder, 215-horsepower all-wheel
drive ML320? Well, DaimlerChrysler is back with the 4.3-liter,

Steyr-Daimler-Puch, an Austrian contractor for Daimler-Benz,
developed a heavy, Jeep-like, four-wheel-drive military vehicle for
the Shah of Iran. After he was overthrown, Mercedes sold this
Gelaendewagen _ ``cross country vehicle'' in German _ to various
European armies and then to a few civilians. In 1983, David
Holland, the founder of Europa International, a dealer of vintage
Mercedes cars in Santa Fe, N.M., got the idea of importing G-Wagens
for their curiosity value. From 1995 to '98, Europa sold a few
dozen lushly-equipped three- and five-door versions (labeled the
G320 for their 3.2-liter six cylinder engines). Now Europa is
importing a yet-swankier version, a model that preserves the
G-Wagen's squarely retro look but uses a new Mercedes engine that
meets environmental requirements in all 50 states. By Peter
Passell.

 &HT;    BellSouth launches new portal
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _BellSouth.net is launching a new portal service today
called BellSouth Buzz to boost usage of its online yellow pages and
attract advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The sites, to be maintained by 40 BellSouth employees, will be
customized for each of the 62 markets served by BellSouth's
nine-state region.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta users can access Atlanta Buzz at http://www.
bellsouth.net. The site will have city-specific news, information,
entertainment, discussion groups and the opportunity for users to
build community areas similar to those on AccessAtlanta, one of the
top Web sites in the area.
</P>
<P>
   AccessAtlanta will contribute content to BellSouth's Buzz.
through a linking agreement. Buzz users who click on AccessAtlanta
content will, in turn, be referred back to the AccessAtlanta site.
AccessAtlanta is a unit of unit of Cox Interactive Media, part of
Cox Enterprises which owns The Atlanta Journal and Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's vice president of Advanced Data Systems Donna
LaChance, who heads up the Buzz project says, ``We want to provide
a compelling starting place for people who want to get the most out
of their time online. We are going to do this by focusing on their
local community, local commerce and advanced communications.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buzz sites will be built and maintained by BellSouth.net
content developers and managers who will build community, chat and
other areas for users.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth seems to have ripped a page from not just
AccessAtlanta, but also from Microsoft Sidewalk's local buying
guides.
</P>
<P>
   The company has more than 30 content providers contributing to
the site in addition to AccessAtlanta, including USA Today and
Thompson Financial Networks.
</P>
<P>
   LaChance says that part of BellSouth's strategy is to
incorporate local news content into its site wherever it comes
from. That's why she's turning to local sites like AccessAtlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yellow pages are integral to this local portal,'' says
LaChance. ``The whole purpose of the site is to help people live
their lives.'' She says BellSouth's yellow pages can't be found
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only (southeastern yellow pages) that will be
up-to-the-minute current,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   LaChance says she also hopes to sell display ads online which
will push local advertisers to the top of the listings heap.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester analyst Bill Bass says BellSouth's portal strategy is
a way to drive users to its online yellow pages. ``BellSouth is
going to have the best yellow pages directory in the southeast with
the most updates and the most phone numbers. They are sitting on a
tremendous asset, but the problem is, how do you get people to go
to that site, `` he says. ``The best way to do that is to build out
functionality.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why BellSouth is turning to other local media companies
like AccessAtlanta for local news and other content
</P>
<P>
   Users don't have to be subscribers to BellSouth.net, the
company's Internet service provider to access the service.

 &HT;    Dow misses a 10,000 close by a whisker
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thrill of victory eluded stock market investors
againThursday, although they avoided the agony of defeat when the
Dow Jones industrial average remained within three points of
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark index of 30 blue chip stocks crossed 10,000
several times in the closing minutes, topping out at 10,001.51
before falling back. Even so, it closed up 1.2 percent at a new
high.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for a major stock index to hit a wall when
approaching a highly publicized benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, computerized sell programs get in the way; other
times the number starts to lose its magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, crossing a round number seems to be an
anti-climactic event,'' Merrill Lynch chief market strategist Dick
Mccabe said.
</P>
<P>
   The index first traded above 10,000 early Tuesday, reaching
10,001.78 before dropping back.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge Thursday were American Express, up $6.68 3/4
to $127.62 1/2; Philip Morris, $3.75 to $42; J.P. Morgan, $2.68 3/4
to $124.18 3/4; and Merck, $2 to $86.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts give the Dow good odds of closing over the top in
today's ``triple witching'' session, when stock options, index
options and index futures expire, adding to market turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite indexes both rose 1.4
percent, with the S&AMP;P 500 also closing at a new high.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury yields fell after a government report that February
consumer prices rose only 0.1 percent due to cheap imports. But
those imports also sent the U.S. trade deficit to a record $17
billion in January.

 &HT;    WebMD purchases health-care software
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WebMD has agreed to buy 50,000 copies of souped-up
communications software for health-care professionals from Premiere
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the largest sale thus far of Premiere's flagship
product, the Orchestra software, acccording to company Senior Vice
President Randy Salisbury, senior vice president of Atlanta-based
Premiere.
</P>
<P>
   While the announcement is a boost to a pair of ambitious
companies, it is also a deal done between two that already are
closely related. The two companies share the same building and at
least one board member _ Billy Payne, former president of the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Premiere also owns about 10 percent of WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   Via the Internet, WebMD offers a range of specialized medical
data to professionals, who pay for the service, as well as a
variety of free health information to consumers. The company is
planning to provide the Orchestra software to doctors, nurses and
other healthcare professionals who subscribe to the company's
$30-a-month service.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Premiere will let WebMD offer doctors signing up
for its Internet service a more effective way to receive and send
messages through a feature called ``virtual receptionist.''
</P>
<P>
   Premiere's Orchestrate software lets a user on a phone hear
voice mail, as well as fax and e-mail messages. The user can
respond with the push of a button, either being connected with the
caller or by having the system record a message and send it through
the Net as an audio file to the sender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just making it more convenient and simplifying
communications,'' Salisbury said. ``Now doctors can use different
devices to communicate with all the people who are trying to
communicate with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Orchestrate also lets the user tap into voice and e-mail
messages via computer. However, it would not be possible to respond
via the computer to any caller whose e-mail address is not
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD's top officials were traveling and unavailable for
comment. But Salisbury said Premiere is confident that WebMD's
business will do so well that 50,000 copies of Orchestra will not
be enough, Salisbury said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale will also not be the last large deal, although it comes
in marked contrast to previous sales to small and home offices,
Salisbury said. ``Those are mostly onesies and twosies. But we have
other partnerships pending. WebMD is the only the first of a number
of companies.''
</P>
<P>
   WebMD, which launched its service in the fall, has recently
announced plans for an initial public offering of stock sometime in
the next few months. The company had similar plans in August, then
pulled back from the brink when the market for IPOs went sour.

   WASHINGTON _ The lights had dimmed, the band was packing up, the
crowd of more than 2,000 in the cavernous convention hall had
dwindled to less than two dozen.
</P>
<P>
   But here was the president of the United States, still working
the ropeline, shaking every last hand, soaking up the last
glimmering rays of Arkansas adulation.
</P>
<P>
   The scene last weekend at the Little Rock convention center
after a state Democratic party fund-raising dinner captured a

Bill Clinton enters its twilight.

   More and more, the president looks and sounds like yesterday's
man, spending large measures of his precious final days in office
revisiting the scenes of yesterday's glories and trying to forget
the pain of the humiliating impeachment battle he survived. He is
clinging to his last hours on stage, as the spotlight shifts to the
rising careers of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Only a hundred yards from the convention hall where Clinton
lingered in nostalgic reverie last Saturday sits Arkansas' Old
State House, where Clinton and throngs of delirious thousands
celebrated his two presidential election victories on crisp
November nights. The weekend trip to Arkansas included a visit to
Hope, where he dedicated his boyhood home as a historical shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Clinton took a sentimental journey to New Hampshire,
not only to boost the candidacy of Gore, but also to relive his own
triumph seven years ago, when he overcame charges of adultery and
draft-dodging to place a respectable second in the New Hampshire
primary. That near-win earned him the moniker of ``Comeback Kid''
and catapulted him to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In his public comments and his private ruminations, Clinton's
mortality weighs heavily on him, as the poet John Keats put it,
like unwilling sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Though only 52, Clinton has lived the equivalent of three
lifetimes in politics and soon will be one of the youngest
ex-presidents ever.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke last Saturday in Little Rock of his ``imminent
retirement'' and reminded his audience that life and human
accomplishment are fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you strip it all away,'' Clinton said as a cold March
rain fell outside, ``it comes down to that _ to humility, humanity,
a sense of one's own mortality and one's own capacity for
incredible dignity and glory.''
</P>
<P>
   But along with wistfulness there is remorse, too, and abiding
anger. The time for public apologies is past _ Clinton issued
near-weekly expressions of regret in the final months of the Monica
Lewinsky saga _ but the president in private continues a campaign
of seeking forgiveness from his family and his band of loyal
followers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mistaking the sincerity of the president's regret
about the foolishness of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and his
efforts to conceal it, Clinton's friends say. He knows that he has
brought pain to his family and has given license to former aides
like George Stephanopoulos and Mike McCurry to question his fitness
for office.
</P>
<P>
   But his anger is as deeply felt as his remorse, associates say.
He believes that he has been the victim of a Republican plot to
undermine his authority and destroy him personally, they say. He
reserves particular venom for Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, and the Republican leadership of the House who together
branded him with the indelible stain of impeachment. It is they,
not he, Clinton has told friends, that history will hunt down and
condemn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how he internalizes it in his mind,'' said one close
associate of the president. ``Many will differ, but that's what
keeps him going each day. He's got to get up each morning to run
the world, and that's how he does it.''
</P>
<P>
   For most politicians, the impeachment inquiry and its
revelations would have been devastating. But for Clinton, it was
but the latest in a career of public indignities and embarrassing
disclosures. Clinton has responded consistently _ with denial and
denunciation of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos, in his new book about Clinton, ``All Too
Human,'' said that Clinton saw himself as the ``target of
unscrupulous enemies who would try to destroy him personally
because they opposed his policies.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, justified everything the Clinton camp did in
reply, Stephanopoulos wrote _ lying, intimidation, hitting back.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a weird way,'' said another close Clinton ally, ``the
excessive zealotry of his opponents is what helps him and his
supporters sleep at night. If they hadn't used his behavior to try
to take over the country, there'd be no defending it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As time passes and the 2000 campaigns get under way, Clinton
plays a less and less central role in the political world, except
as the Democratic Party's most prodigious fund-raiser ever. The
future of the first lady is of much more interest in Washington and
New York today than that of Clinton. And Gore is now chartering
airplanes to accommodate the press contingent that has begun to
follow him, while presidential press charters are flying with
scores of empty seats, or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's now in the frame of mind that pretty soon it'll
be Gore's whole bailiwick,'' said a Washington political consultant
who knows the president and vice president well. ``He knows the
torch will be passed soon and he wants to get as much done as he
can. But he's also realistic it'll be Gore's whole banana to deal
with soon. He realizes that; he has no false delusions about that
at all. He understands where he is and he accepts that pretty
readily.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still plays the political game with relish, even though
he has run his last campaign. Nothing engages him more than a
detailed discussion of New York politics, war-gaming a possible
Senate race between his wife and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   He also lights up when analyzing a possible race between Gore
and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is the early favorite for the
Republican presidential nomination. But these are other people's
battles, not his.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is still dusting himself off after his impeachment
trial, which he survived, but at a horrendous cost. The president
has emerged from a year of isolation from all but his closest
friends and financial supporters. Last week he invited reporters to
two off-the-record dinners in Central America and on Friday he is
to hold his first full-dress press conference in nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as he would like to talk about his proposals for
Social Security and education, he is likely to be questioned more
about his past than about his plans. He has never been asked, for
example, about the impeachment trial and what lessons he took from
it.
</P>
<P>
   He is also likely to be asked about Mrs. Clinton's political
plans and his assessment of Gore's chances. Beyond sketching out
his proposals for entitlement programs and education, he has not
drawn a large-scale picture of his agenda for his remaining months
as president.
</P>
<P>
   But at a more profound level, Clinton is already thinking beyond
his last 22 months in office to the imprint he will leave on
American politics and American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our public life is poorer when people forget the past and
ignore the future,'' Clinton said last weekend. ``It is poorer when
they choose power over purpose because they forget we're just here
for a little speck of time. And in 100 or 200 years, nobody will
remember any of us, and all that will endure is whatever
contribution we made to make life better and richer and more
decent.''

 &HT;    'AMAZING RANDI' TAKES CAMPAIGN AGAINST QUACKERY TO CONGRESS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - James Randi, the former magician who has found a
second career in debunking what he calls ``pseudoscience,'' called
on Congress Thursday to protect a gullible public from a flood of
untested and unproven ``natural'' products.
</P>
<P>
   To dramatize what he called the ``quackery'' of homeopathy,
Randi gobbled down a box full of homeopathic pills that purport to
treat insomnia, even though the label said the ``maximum'' dose was
a pill every two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words 'natural' and 'herbal' are seen and heard aplenty in
advertisements for quack products,'' Randi said in an appearance
sponsored by the House Science and Technology Committee. ``And
American citizens, some 70 million of them, are embracing untested
and unproven nostrums. We owe them better than to ignore their need
for information.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling homeopathy ``one example of the sort of nonsense we have
to deal with,'' Randi held up a box containing the ``homeopathic''
insomnia remedy, which he said he had purchased at a store operated
by a national drugstore chain.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum dose, according to the label on the box of
``Naturelife'' insomnia pills, was one pill every two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 45 tablets (in the box),'' he said. ``I'll take the
whole works.''
</P>
<P>
   Munching away and sipping water, Randi explained that the pills
purport to contain coffee in a concentration of ``30x.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just how much coffee did I get when I ingested all 45 pills in
this package?'' he asked. ``Zero. Zilch. Nada. In fact, the
concentration of '30x,' the favored concentration in most
homeopathy, would mean that there is one part coffee in one
thousand, billion, billion, billion parts milk sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that number means that he would have to consume ``16
swimming pools filled to the brim with these pills'' in order to
get a single molecule of caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Morris, who said he was an education specialist for
Nature's Way of Provo, Utah, the apparent manufacturer of the pills
Randi took, said the pills don't have to actually contain caffeine
to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Morris insisted that homeopathy works, although he said no one
knows why. One theory is that substances that have come into
contact with active ingredients, such as caffeine, ``remember'' the
ingredients and convey their effect in some way, according to
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine, normally thought of as a substance that keeps people
awake, is taken as a homeopathic cure of insomnia under a theory
that it ``immunizes'' the user in some way.
</P>
<P>
   Randi, who won a MacArthur Foundation prize several years ago
for his work debunking ``paranormal'' science, faith healers and
medical quackery, spoke to about 50 people in the committee's
hearing room. All members of the committee were involves in House
floor debate, so none attended his presentation.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that he was not the first ``conjuror'' to appear at a
congressional event (cq). The famous magician Harry Houdini
testified before a packed house in 1926 to promote a bill against
fortune-telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houdini, as I, was dismayed at the public belief in
supernatural forces and pseudoscientific notions,'' Randi said.
``But perhaps his solution, legislation, was not the ideal one. I
favor education over legislation, so that citizens will avoid
surrendering to the charlatans due to better information and an
``understanding of how the real world works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all subject to bad judgment from time to time,'' he
added. ``But much of that weakness can be avoided by education, at
a very early age. We owe it to our kids to inform them and train
them how to think, not what to think.''

SERBS CONTINUE TO REJECT PEACE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ In a symbolic act that held more promise of a
threatened airstrike than of making peace on the ground, ethnic
Albanians Thursday put their sole signatures on a peace plan for
the disputed province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, however, are continuing to refuse to sign the
Western-crafted document, heightening the possibility that a
long-threatened NATO assault on Serbia might be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the ruling Serbian regime continued a massive
military buildup, fueling fears that they are gearing up for a
fight against the Kosovo Liberation Army, a pro-independence
militia that has been battling Serb forces for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian delegation ``signature shows their commitment to a
peace settlement and for a future of democratic self-government,''
US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said after the Paris
signing ceremony. ``Unfortunately, the Serb negotiations have gone
backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just like to remind Mr. (Yugoslav President Slobodan)
Milosevic that NATO stands ready to take whatever measures are
necessary,'' Albright said after briefing Senators in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk in Paris that the Serbs would be given a
grace period _ perhaps until Wednesday _ to sign. But White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart and Philip Reeker, spokesman for US peace
negotiator Chris Hill, said no deadline was set.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian delegation was given more than two weeks after the
talks ceased in Rambouillet, France last month to canvass their own
constituency and amass support for the plan.
</P>
<P>
   A second round of peace talks in Paris appeared ready to
dissolve Thursday, with the Albanians leaving town and the Serbs
showing no sign of wanting to negotiate further.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, designed by a Contact Group of six Western powers,
gives broad political autonomy to Kosovo, a southern province of
Serbia, which is itself a republic of Yugoslavia. The proposed deal
would give more authority to local ethnic Albanians, who make up an
estimated 90 percent of Kosovo's 2.2 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are refusing to even discuss one of the Contact
Group's critical demands _ that there be 28,000 NATO troops,
including 4,000 Americans, in Kosovo to keep the peace after an
agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the Serbs also were trying to change elements of the
political agreement already agreed to in the first round of peace
talks last month in Rambouillet, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   In a year of attacks and retreats by both sides, an October
cease-fire agreement that has been honored by neither side, and two
sets of political negotiations that have been signed by only one
side, the outlook for Kosovo has never been so grim.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has continued in Kosovo, where more than 2,000 people
have been killed and well over a quarter of a million people have
been displaced.
</P>
<P>
   More Albanian villages were burned this week, forcing thousands
of refugees to flee. Aid organizations have reported an influx of
refugees into neighboring Macedonia, on Kosovo's southern border.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has been threatening an air strike against Milosevic since
October. After the peace negotiations began last month, Albright
said NATO would strike only if the Albanians signed, but the Serbs
did not.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's solemn signing ceremony in Paris made the warning of
a NATO attack more acute.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the international mediators _ Hill and European
Union representative Wolfgang Petritsch _ signed the plan as
witnesses. The Russian mediator, Boris Maiorsky, did not add his
name to the document. Russia traditionally has had stronger ties
with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock also puts pressure on NATO, which has repeatedly
warned Milosevic it might strike, but has not followed through.
Advocates of an air assault insist force is the only language
Milosevic understands, noting that it was only after NATO air
strikes in Bosnia in 1995 that a peace agreement was forged.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting Serbia is trickier politically, since it would be an
assault on the national army of a sovereign nation involved in an
internal conflict. In Bosnia, there was the pretext of cross-border
aggression by the Serbs to justify an attack by international
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing Serbia could well produce American casualities, one of
the Pentagon's chief military commanders told Congress Thursday.
The prospect would make an air attack on Serbia more difficult to
sell to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Since Yugoslavia's air defenses are well-defended, ``there is a
distinct possibility we will lose aircraft in trying to penetrate
those defenses,'' Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff,
told the Senate Armed Services Committee.

BOSTON MUSLIM LEADER DENIES FARRAKHAN SERIOUSLY ILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA AND TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The rumor mill has been working overtime lately within
the Nation of Islam. Reports have circulated that one of its
leaders, the fiery Louis Farrakhan, was gravely ill with an unknown
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Minister Don Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam
mosque in Boston, denied the reports, circulated by a top Nation of
Islam official that Farrakhan was battling a life-threatening
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an erroneous story going around,'' said Muhammad,
standing in his daughter's restaurant in the city's Grove Hall
section. ``He will be taking a much-needed rest.'' Farrakhan has a
home in Arizona, but officials have not disclosed where he is
resting.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Farrakhan himself helped inflame rumors when he
told followers in Chicago that he had been sick for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I am nearing 66 years of age, I have never been ill
like this in my life,'' Farrakhan said during a Nation of Islam
celebration that drew more than 20,000 people to a Chicago
convention hall. ``This illness took me down so fast that I lost
nearly 20 pounds in less than two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan's speech is included in the nation's official website.
In 1991 Farrakhan announced he had prostate cancer, for which he
has been receiving treatment on and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no appetite,'' he said in Chicago. ``And night sweats,
pain, bouts of insomnia. I was anemic, dehydraded. But I thank
Allah, the healer, for gradually returning my health and my
strength back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Several phone calls to the Nation of Islam headquarters in
Chicago Thursday were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   At Mosque Maryam, Farrakhan's home base on the city's South
Side, there was a steady flow of vehicles, but nothing to suggest
anything out of the ordinary. Mosque members refused to discuss
Farrakhan's health.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published earlier this week in the Final Call, the
Nation's official newspaper, and posted on the paper's website,
Jabril Muhammad, one of Farrakhan's closest advisers, said the
sharp-tongued Muslim leader was ``struggling to overcome the forces
of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Jabril Muhammad said Farrakhan was so sick it was uncertain
whether he would be able to appear during the February celebration.
But Farrakhan, Jabril Muhammad added, not only appeared, but spoke
for more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
   According to another person who saw the speech, Farrakhan was
thinner than usual, but looked vigorous. Although Farrakhan hinted
several times that this might be his last appearance at the
February event, he has made such suggestions in the past, often
with the implication that someone might try to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest issue of the Village Voice, Farrakhan reportedly
told his followers that he had been poisoned by the US government.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, rumors that Farrakhan was close to death reverberated
across Roxbury, where as a child growing up he was known as Louis
Eugene Walcott.
</P>
<P>
   Elma Lewis, a Boston cultural arts legend, said she received
calls Thursday morning inquiring about her friend's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was shook up, but I knew if that was true I would
have known,'' said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, when Lewis was very sick, Farrakhan and
his sons visited her Roxbury home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is like a little brother to me. He was a beautiful,
beautiful little boy,'' said Lewis, 78. ``Now Malcom (Malcolm X)
was a bad boy turned good, but Farrakhan was always a good boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they don't subscribe to the same philosphy, Lewis said
they have remained close friends. Whenever Farrakahn visits Boston,
he calls or visits her. Sometimes he will call from Chicago, and
the two will talk about current events or their lives in Roxbury so
many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said she knew Farrakhan had been sick throughout January
or February, but was shocked and annoyed to hear rumors that his
health had taken a turn for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   She said black leaders Farrakhan, Malcolm X and Martin Luther
King Jr. expect to die by a gun, not by illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, if someone would have told me that he was assassinated,
then I would have believed it. But to be felled by a disease at
such a young age, when he lives such a clean life is shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Farrakhan eats only once a day, subscribes to a strict
diet, and regularly exercises.
</P>

 &HT;    PENTAGON OFFICIALS WARN OF 'LOSS OF LIFE' IN KOSOVO CAMPAIGN, AS
SERBS REJECT PEACE PLAN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Serbs rejected a U.S. peace plan for Kosovo on
Thursday and advanced preparations for an all-out ground war, as
the Pentagon warned of the perils and uncertainties of NATO air
strikes in the troubled Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Flying into the jaws of aggressive air defenses over craggy
terrain in foul weather and, at times, chasing hard to find mobile
targets, U.S. and other NATO pilots could run a substantial risk of
being shot down, cautioned Air Force chief of staff Gen. Michael
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a distinct possibility we will lose aircraft in
trying to penetrate those defenses,'' Ryan testified before the
Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be under no illusions that this would be easy,''
echoed Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of operations for the Navy, which
would likely front pilots as part of a NATO air campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is high, in my view,'' said Johnson, ''And we must be
prepared to take losses if we engage that system.''
</P>
<P>
   With target lists complete for more than 350 NATO warplanes --
half of them American -- standing by to launch strikes against Serb
military and communications sites, the White House said the
long-looming military showdown with the Serbs was near.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached the final and decisive phase,'' President
Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, told reporters. ``The military
planning is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart made the remarks shortly after ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo, a province in the Yugoslav state of Serbia, signed onto a
U.S.-brokered peace treaty in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic, however, remained
intransigent, refusing to sign the accord, which calls for sending
28,000 NATO peacekeepers into Kosovo, where more than a year of war
has left some 2,000 dead and more than 230,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has threatened air strikes against Serbs if they refuse to
sign the peace treaty, or if they continue a campaign of attacking
ethnic Albanians -- who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population
of 2.2 million -- and villages across the rural province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Such strikes likely would not begin before early next week,
officials said, to give time to evacuate more than 1,000
international monitors and humanitarian workers now on the ground
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is as clear as it could be,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright told reporters on Capitol Hill. ``The Albanians
have said yes to the accords and the Serbs are saying no.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, Belgrade's security forces are stepping up
their unjustified and aggressive actions in Kosovo, and if Belgrade
doesn't reverse course, the Serbs alone will be responsible for the
consequences,'' Albright added. ``NATO stands ready to take
whatever measures are necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon estimates that more than 30,000 Serb troops --
backed by scores of tanks and other armored equipment -- have
massed in and around Kosovo, in apparent preparation for a major
ground assault.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the rebel group, the Kosovo Liberation Army, reported
seeing Serbs setting up mobile surface-to-air missiles in the
rugged mountains outside of the Kosovo capital of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The region is also bristling with Soviet-built surface-to-air
missile defenses, some shoulder-fired heat-seeking missiles and
more than 2,000 anti-aircraft guns, remnants of the Cold War days
when Yugoslavia was part of the Soviet defense structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a robust, highly integrated, well-equipped air defense
system, operated by well-trained people,'' Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon told reporters. ``They have been rehearsing and
training fairly aggressively in the last several weeks, and it is a
system to be taken very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Air strikes would likely begin with the firing of scores of
long-range cruise missiles, capable of flying hundreds of miles to
destroy their targets with no risk to the troops firing them. There
are six U.S. ships and submarines in the region capable of firing
such weapons, which can also be launched from aircraft flying at
high altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, cruise missile attacks would be followed up with
air strikes from warplanes protected by U.S. EA-6b jets -- packed
with sophisticated electronic jamming equipment to thwart radar --
from nearby Aviano Air Base in Italy, as well as F-16s armed with
radar-seeking missiles.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a dozen radar-evading F-117 stealth bombers now
at Aviano, Gen. Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Even using the most sophisticated warplanes in the U.S. arsenal,
however, success in Kosovo is not assured.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be tremendously dangerous,'' warned Marine
Corps Commandant, Gen. Charles Krulak. ``The systems are, in many
instances, mobile. The terrain is very tough. And the weather
cannot be underestimated. That can be a show-stopper in many
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet to be worked out, Krulak said, are a host of strategic and
political questions unrelated to the logistics of military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom-line question that needs to be resolved is 'Would
the strikes, and will the strikes, achieve an end? What is that
end,''' Krulak said.
</P>
<P>
   Krulak's concerns were echoed by Senate Republicans, some of
whom said the White House hasn't laid the political foundation for
the country to support high-risk air strikes in far-off Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate is not comfortable with the situation as it now
stands,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
immediately following a closed-door briefing with Albright, Defense
Secretary William Cohen and other members of Clinton's national
security team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be briefed more, we need to be advised what the
risks are,'' Lott said, ``and the American people need to have a
better understanding of what the United States national security
interests are, if any.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lott stopped short of saying he would oppose strikes,
others did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more convinced than ever that this is a mistake at this
time,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. ``I am very firm
that I will oppose action in Kosovo until there is a clear peace
agreement and until we know what the mission is, we know what is
expected of our troops, how many it will take, what it will cost,
and what our timetable will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House maintains that it does not need congressional
approval for U.S. forces to participate in NATO air strikes against
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed an activation order formally authorizing U.S.
participation in such strikes last October. That move spurred
Milosevic to agree to a set of peace accords -- including
withdrawing military forces from Kosovo and ending aggression
against ethnic Albanians there -- that the Serbs have since
violated.
</P>
<P>
   While part of Serbia's territory, Kosovo has been a tinderbox
for years. Majority Albanians largely favor independence. Under the
U.S.-backed peace accord Kosovar Albanians signed Thursday, Kosovo
would be granted autonomy -- the same status it enjoyed until 1989
as part of the former Yugoslavia -- but not full independence.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles in Kosovo loosely mirror those in nearby Bosnia,
where NATO air strikes combined with U.S. diplomacy in the fall of
1995 to end three and a half years of ethnic fighting among Serbs
and non-Serbs. A U.S.-led NATO peacekeeping mission has been posted
in Bosnia for the past three years, policing the fragile peace
there.

<P>
   Emil F. Guba, a professor of plant pathology and mycology who
helped develop a species of greenhouse tomato resistant to leaf
mold disease, died Tuesday in Bethesda at Evanswood Nursing
Facility in Kingston, Mass. He was 101.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Guba was a professor at the University of Massachusetts and
researcher at the Waltham Field Station for nearly 40 years. His
work led to the elimination or amelioration of many plant diseases,
including the propagation of varieties of carnations resistant to
several maladies, and the formulation of techniques that allow
fruit to avoid spoilage both in storage and in the field.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author or co-author of more than 100 agricultural
bulletins and scientific papers.
</P>
<P>
   A grant from the National Science Foundation allowed him to
preserve all the study materials and fungus specimens that he
accumulated in the research for his magnum opus, ``Monograph of
Monochaetia and Pestalotia,'' which was the result of 40 years of
work and was published by Harvard University Press. Those materials
now repose in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the book ``Wild Mushrooms, Food and Poison,'' he
was a consultant to the Boston Poison Information Center at
Children's Hospital Medical Center and an enthusiastic participant
in mushroom tastings sponsored by the Boston Mycological Club, of
which he was a honorary member.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring in 1962, he cultivated an interest in history,
particularly that of Nantucket, where he had studied the vegetation
for several scientific papers. He was the author of the history
book ``Nantucket Odyssey'' and a biography of the woman who posed
as a man and fought in the American Revolution, titled ``Deborah
Samson, Alias Robert Shurtliff, Revolutionary War Soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Guba was born in New Bedford, Mass. He graduated from
Massachusetts Agricultural College and the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves a son, Robert, of Acton, Mass.; a daughter, Anne, of
Kingston, Mass.; four grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.

SENATE PASSES BILLS TO LOWER ALCOHOL LIMIT, IMPOSE PENALTIES FOR
DRIVERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas senators, seeking to save lives and draw
$26 million in federal highway funds, passed bills Thursday to
lower the legal alcohol limit for drivers and hike penalties for
those refusing breathalyzer tests.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 114 by Sen. Mario Gallegos, D-Galena Park, would
lower the legal limit from .10 percent to .08 percent blood-alcohol
content.
</P>
<P>
   A separate measure, SB 388, would suspend drivers' licenses for
those refusing to take a breathalyzer or blood test for a year
rather than the current 90 days. The bill sponsored by Sen. Eddie
Lucio, D-Brownsville, also increases jail time for drunk-driving
offenders from at least three days to a minimum of five days.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who endorsed the legislation along with
Gov. George W. Bush and Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said it will
go a long way toward ``cracking down on the drunk-driving carnage''
on Texas highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bills also say we care about our friends, neighbors and
families,'' he added. ``Too many in our state have already suffered
the great loss associated with drunk driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Gallegos' bill, a 170-pound man would have to stop
drinking after four drinks in one hour on an empty stomach. A
120-pound woman would have to stop at three drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all heard the heart-breaking testimony from our
constituents,'' said Gallegos, whose bill drew parents and friends
of four high school girls killed by a drunken driver to hearings
before the Senate Criminal Justice Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he said, 1,700 Texans were lost to drunk-driving
accidents, he said, with another Texan killed every eight hours and
13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced an effective way to curb this kind of insanity
is through the enactment of Senate Bill 114,'' Gallegos said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Berman, general counsel for the American Beverage
Institute, argues the lower alcohol limit targets responsible
social drinkers, and other critics say these are not the drivers
causing the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only effect of an .08 law is that many social drinkers
will be jailed, fined and suffer costs up to $15,000,'' he said,
``for behavior that is presently considered responsible in most
states and that is not part of the drunk-driving problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos faced a series of questions in the Senate from Lucio,
who sponsored the companion drunk-driving bill but also was
responsible for killing Gallegos' bill last session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every newspaper in this state reiterates that I was the one
that tagged your bill last session at the eleventh hour. That's
history,'' said Lucio who said he joins in expressing condolences
to families who've lost loved ones in drunk-driving accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio said he felt at the time that the legislation would
incriminate law-abiding citizens. He also said that the driver who
killed the four high school girls had a blood-alcohol levels of
.16, or twice the proposed new rate.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio, who supported the bill anyway, underwent scrutiny himself
on his companion bill regarding how much more it will cost counties
to keep drunk drivers in jail longer.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, and others questioned the high price
tag Lucio's bill carries, according to estimates in the fiscal note
to the bill. It shows that if two days are added to the minimum
jail time for those guilty of drunken driving, it would costs
counties $1.8 million more statewide.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the 33 percent of drivers refusing to take the test took
it and were found guilty, the costs would rise by another $2.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio said if the bill saves lives by keeping drunken drivers
off the street, the cost should not matter.
</P>
<P>
   A third bill seeks to stop courts from routinely letting teens
off easy for violating a zero-tolerance law on drinking any amount
of alcohol and driving. The bill, sponsored by West, clarifies that
even when teens agree to deferred adjudication to avoid a trial,
they must agree to perform community service in a addition to
paying a fine. Also, their drivers' licenses must be suspended for
a time beginning with the 11th day following a conviction.

IOC CHANGES WAY HOST CITIES ARE TO BE CHOSEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The Austrians had a TravelMate laptop at
their promotional booth in the lobby of the Palais de Beaulieu. If
an International Olympic Committee member wanted a look at
Klagenfurt this week, he could push a button and have a ``virtual
visit.'' But he can't go there _ at least not before the site for
the 2006 Winter Games is chosen in June.
</P>
<P>
   No more trips to bid cities, the IOC has ruled. No more loans,
no more scholarships, no more cosmetic surgery, no more drooling
bulldogs. No more of the cornucopia of improprieties that produced
the most unsavory chapter in modern Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake give-and-take has gone low-budget. ``We can give a
money clip _ with no money in it,'' said Dieter Kalt, general
manager for the Klagenfurt bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   While Kalt was handing out symbolically empty clips Thursday
morning (``Let me corrupt you,'' he joked), the IOC members were
upstairs putting a formal end to the bidding process that brought
them scandal and shame.
</P>
<P>
   Though the full body still will pick the 2006 host city at its
next meeting in Seoul, it will choose from only two finalists
picked 30 minutes earlier by a 16-member panel (only 11 of them IOC
members) assembled that morning.
</P>
<P>
   For information, they will rely solely on a detailed report from
the IOC's site evaluation committee and a one-hour presentation
from each city. No visits _ period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, really, that's enough,'' stated IOC president Juan
Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, insist most of the six European candidates for 2006, who
claim that the no-visit rule gives a huge advantage to Sion, the
Swiss town that was a runner-up to Salt Lake last time. Sion got to
entertain roughly 70 IOC members under the old cashmere-and-caviar
rules. Nobody can do anything close this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can send them a book, but it is not the same thing,'' says
Marco San Pietro, international relations director for the Turin
committee. ``They cannot taste our wine or our food.''
</P>
<P>
   Turin, which has never bid before, was counting on wooing the
Lords of the Rings in person and pointing out that Italy's auto
capital has mountains nearby. ``Turin is not well known,'' says San
Pietro. ``It is perceived as an industrial city, the home of
Fiat.''
</P>
<P>
   Finland, bidding with the Norwegians, wanted to show that
Lillehammer is a long walk from Helsinki but a short flight.
Klagenfurt, which is pushing an unprecedented three-country Games
involving Austria, Italy, and Slovenia, wanted to prove it could
handle the complex logistics of a `bid without borders'.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show them that you could have breakfast in
Klagenfurt, lunch in Tarvisio, and dinner in Kranjska Gora,'' says
international relations director Petra Oberrauner. ``Now, they
cannot see our hospitality.''
</P>
<P>
   The H-word is taboo in the post-Salt Lake era and the 2006
cities grudgingly accept that. ``They all understand the crisis
we're in,'' says IOC vice president Richard Pound of Canada. ``They
understand that visits are now regarded as anathema by almost
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The visits led to the ski vacations, which led to the
scholarships, which led to the five-figure payoffs that has torn
the IOC apart and produced the most radical reforms in its 105
years.
</P>
<P>
   Besides expelling six members Wednesday beyond the four who had
already resigned, the IOC, as expected, Thursday unanimously pushed
through a series of changes that will open up what has always been
a private club to global scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the month, the IOC will name both an independent
ethics panel and a reform commission (half of its members
outsiders) that will recommend changes in everything from how the
IOC chooses its members to how it distributes its money. Thursday,
the IOC posted its interim financial audit on the Internet
(www.olympic.org) for the world to pore over. ``We promised to
clean our house and begin reforms,'' said Samaranch. ``I think we
kept our word.''
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown on bid cities, Samaranch said, was both necessary
and overdue. ``The system of visits was a very bad system,'' he
said. ``So we cancel the system.''
</P>
<P>
   A 16-member panel, picked the morning of the vote in Seoul in
June, will narrow the six bid cities (Sion; Turin; Helsinki;
Klagenfurt; Zakopane, Poland; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia) to two
finalists. The entire 100-plus IOC membership will choose the
winner. The panel will include: Samaranch, IOC dean Joao Havelange,
eight other IOC members, the chairman of the IOC's site evaluation
commission, one representative from both the winter sports
federations and the national Olympic committees, and three
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the IOC chose a winter site, in Budapest four
years ago, the Salt Lake City bidders brought nearly $50,000 for
last-minute lobbying. This week, Turin was handing out red silk
ties (``only worth $30,'' San Pietro insisted) and pens. And
Klagenfurt offered ``virtually'' nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Oberrauner said Thursday, clicking on a laptop map.
``Here is a 360-degree view of our downhill site. Want me to zoom
in?''

CARE FOR THE DYING CAN BE IMPROVED, COALITION INSISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Jack Kevorkian offers dying patients a false choice
between suicide and a painful, technology-filled death, a panel
representing more than 300 health, religious and consumer
organizations said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Good end-of-life care with compassionate treatment and effective
pain relief is possible for all patients if the public demands it,
the Last Acts coalition said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans should expect and be able to get end-of-life care
that respects their own wishes and needs,'' said Ira Byock, a
physician on the Last Acts panel. ``Dying is always hard, but it
need not be horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Byock spoke at a press teleconference in Detroit timed to
precede Kevorkian's first-degree murder trial in Michigan next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, a retired pathologist, claims to have been involved
in the assisted suicides of more than 130 people. He is charged
with murder for allegedly injecting a lethal dose of chemicals into
a man with Lou Gehrig's disease. A videotape of the incident was
aired on television's ``60 Minutes'' in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Last Acts coalition includes the American Medical
Association, the American Nurses Association, the American Cancer
Society and the Alzheimer's Association. Its honorary chairwoman is
former first lady Rosalynn Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition hopes to shift the public debate on end-of-life
treatment away from legalization of physician-assisted suicide,
such as Kevorkian practices. Instead, it wants greater public
involvement in initiatives to improve care for dying patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Kevorkian's provocative act raises important questions,''
said panel member Timothy Quill, a physician who supports
legalization of physician-assisted suicide. ``But his answers are
clearly in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian offers a ``very stark and false choice'' between
suicide and a lingering high-tech death, when there are actually
many options for relieving pain and suffering, Quill said.
</P>
<P>
   Much progress in end-of-life care is occurring at the local
level, said panel member Myra Christopher, president of the Midwest
Bioethics Center in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Among the successful programs, Christopher said, is one in
Birmingham, Ala., that provides inpatient hospice care to indigent
patients, and another program in Nevada to monitor patients closely
for pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many, many places there are exciting things being done to
make things different,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Last Acts panel released a national public-opinion survey
that found widespread dissatisfaction with the job the medical
community was doing providing end-of-life care.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of the 1,000 people interviewed by telephone said
the health-care system was doing a poor or only fair job of helping
dying patients stay free of pain, helping them maintain their
dignity and involving patients and their families in care
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Byock said Last Acts hoped to ``dramatically raise public
expectations'' for end-of-life care. To that end, the panel offered
a five-part ``blueprint'' of adequate palliative care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palliative care means taking care of the whole patient, body,
mind...and soul,'' Byock said. ``As long as there is life, we can
treat people with medically excellent care, but also tender loving
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the blueprint:
</P>
<P>
   --Respect for the choices of the dying person. Doctors and
nurses should try to meet treatment preferences of the patient and
family. For example, some patients may prefer care at home.
</P>
<P>
   --Looking after the medical, emotional, social and spiritual
needs of the dying person. Palliative care should offer ways to
reduce pain, ensure that the patient is not alone and help the
patient make peace.
</P>
<P>
   --Support of family members. Family caregivers need time off for
rest, help coping with the costs of caregiving and help with
grieving.
</P>
<P>
   --Access to care providers and appropriate care settings. Good
palliative care assumes that clergy, social workers, and personal
caregivers are as important as doctors and nurses. Home, hospice
and hospital treatment are offered as options.
</P>
<P>
   --Better training of health professionals in end-of-life care
and more comprehensive insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have people say, `I want good end-of-life care. I
know what it is and I'm going to get it for me and my loved ones,'
'' Christopher said.

A GLORIOUS SEASON OF NEW LIFE UNFOLDS ON A VISIT TO THE COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Yesterday was a day of several textures. And everywhere
were the signs of spring coming on with a rush.
</P>
<P>
   The morning was passed with friends on a river, the bluff
sliding by steep and forested, with pale green moss glistening on
the stones. By 9 o'clock, the sun was so warm no coat was needed
except where a bend of the current put the boat in deepest shade.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in afternoon, a couple of hours were spent with a farmer
and his wife, looking at new calves. One had come sometime the
night before. The other was even newer _ hours old only _ and still
had not yet quite found its balance. Of 60-some so far this spring,
the wife said, only two had needed help in getting born.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it's been a fine calving season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have those long, terrible cold spells,'' she said.
``And there weren't any that came when it was so awfully wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost while we watched, it seemed, the latest youngster was
gaining confidence and spunk. He even bucked and kicked a little,
to make clear to us or anyone else who might be watching that he
was a critter to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   Then he teetered away after his mother, looking apt at any
moment to subside in a tangle of knobby legs.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't help thinking what a grand day it was for making
one's start. The forecast told of a chance the bright sky might
give way to storms in a day or two. But for one still tasting the
world's novelties a breath at a time, tomorrow surely is
unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place rich with history, that farm _ three generations in
the same family. And rich with the many shapes that life can take _
the fine cattle herd; mares and their spindly legged foals; five
dogs; 13 cats keeping order in the 100-year-old barn. Also the wild
things, turkeys and deer, that shelter in the band of woods along
the creek at the bottom of the field.
</P>
<P>
   There were stops to make after that. One at a store in the town
close by. Another where a different friend was working in his barn
lot. I spied his truck from the road, and turned up the lane to
visit a bit.
</P>
<P>
   In such an easy, aimless fashion a country day can get away.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner than I'd have thought, the shadows were beginning to be
longer, the air cooler. I left the car at my cabin and walked down
the path to the pond.
</P>
<P>
   New pale-green candles showed at the tips of the pine branches.
The leaf buds of the maples were thumb-sized and bright scarlet.
Birds chittered in the thickets below the dam. I even thought I
heard the creaking of an optimistic _ perhaps fatally foolish _
tree frog.
</P>
<P>
   In only a moment then, late afternoon turned to evening, and I
hurried back up the path to start a stove fire to keep the chill
away. As I came into my clearing, I thought I saw a small movement
at the cabin's west side _ thought that, but wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, a fox has sometimes denned and brought off her
litter of kits in the crawl space beneath the cabin floor. It
pleased me to imagine she might be back.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the light was out and all was still, I heard a
scuttling from down there, followed after a bit by some whining,
yelping complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the noises seemed too robust to be made by foxes.
Coyote pups, possibly.
</P>
<P>
   What's certain is that something's made a home under my floor.
Tomorrow morning, when daylight comes, will be soon enough to
identify my lodger or lodgers. In any case, I don't mind sharing.
</P>
<P>
   It's the season of birthings and beginnings, and everything
alive needs some place to start.

 &HT;    PENTAGON OFFICIALS WARN OF 'LOSS OF LIFE' IN KOSOVO CAMPAIGN, AS
SERBS REJECT PEACE PLAN
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trims throughout.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (w) Washington
categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Serbs rejected a U.S. peace plan for Kosovo on
Thursday and advanced preparations for an all-out ground war, as
the Pentagon warned of the perils and uncertainties of NATO air
strikes in the troubled Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Flying into the jaws of aggressive air defenses over craggy
terrain in foul weather and, at times, chasing hard to find mobile
targets, U.S. and other NATO pilots could run a substantial risk of
being shot down, cautioned Air Force chief of staff Gen. Michael
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a distinct possibility we will lose aircraft in
trying to penetrate those defenses,'' Ryan testified before the
Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be under no illusions that this would be easy,''
echoed Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of operations for the Navy, which
would likely front pilots as part of a NATO air campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is high, in my view,'' said Johnson, ''And we must be
prepared to take losses if we engage that system.''
</P>
<P>
   With target lists complete for more than 350 NATO warplanes --
half of them American -- standing by to launch strikes against Serb
military and communications sites, the White House said the
long-looming military showdown with the Serbs was near.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached the final and decisive phase,'' President
Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, told reporters. ``The military
planning is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart made the remarks shortly after ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo, a province in the Yugoslav state of Serbia, signed onto a
U.S.-brokered peace treaty in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic, however, remained
intransigent, refusing to sign the accord, which calls for sending
28,000 NATO peacekeepers into Kosovo, where more than a year of war
has left some 2,000 dead and more than 230,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has threatened air strikes against Serbs if they refuse to
sign the peace treaty, or if they continue a campaign of attacking
ethnic Albanians -- who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population
of 2.2 million -- and villages across the rural province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Such strikes likely would not begin before early next week,
officials said, to give time to evacuate more than 1,000
international monitors and humanitarian workers now on the ground
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is as clear as it could be,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright told reporters on Capitol Hill. ``The Albanians
have said yes to the accords and the Serbs are saying no.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, Belgrade's security forces are stepping up
their unjustified and aggressive actions in Kosovo, and if Belgrade
doesn't reverse course, the Serbs alone will be responsible for the
consequences,'' Albright added. ``NATO stands ready to take
whatever measures are necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon estimates that more than 30,000 Serb troops --
backed by scores of tanks and other armored equipment -- have
massed in and around Kosovo, in apparent preparation for a major
ground assault.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the rebel group, the Kosovo Liberation Army, reported
seeing Serbs setting up mobile surface-to-air missiles in the
rugged mountains outside of the Kosovo capital of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The region is also bristling with Soviet-built surface-to-air
missile defenses, some shoulder-fired heat-seeking missiles and
more than 2,000 anti-aircraft guns, remnants of the Cold War days
when Yugoslavia was part of the Soviet defense structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a robust, highly integrated, well-equipped air defense
system, operated by well-trained people,'' Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon told reporters. ``They have been rehearsing and
training fairly aggressively in the last several weeks, and it is a
system to be taken very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Air strikes would likely begin with the firing of scores of
long-range cruise missiles, capable of flying hundreds of miles to
destroy their targets with no risk to the troops firing them. There
are six U.S. ships and submarines in the region capable of firing
such weapons, which can also be launched from aircraft flying at
high altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, cruise missile attacks would be followed up with
air strikes from warplanes protected by U.S. EA-6b jets -- packed
with sophisticated electronic jamming equipment to thwart radar --
from nearby Aviano Air Base in Italy, as well as F-16s armed with
radar-seeking missiles.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a dozen radar-evading F-117 stealth bombers now
at Aviano, Gen. Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Even using the most sophisticated warplanes in the U.S. arsenal,
however, success in Kosovo is not assured.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be tremendously dangerous,'' warned Marine
Corps Commandant, Gen. Charles Krulak. ``The systems are, in many
instances, mobile. The terrain is very tough. And the weather
cannot be underestimated. That can be a show-stopper in many
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet to be worked out, Krulak said, are a host of strategic and
political questions unrelated to the logistics of military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom-line question that needs to be resolved is 'Would
the strikes, and will the strikes, achieve an end? What is that
end,''' Krulak said.
</P>
<P>
   Krulak's concerns were echoed by Senate Republicans, some of
whom said the White House hasn't laid the political foundation for
the country to support high-risk air strikes in far-off Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate is not comfortable with the situation as it now
stands,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
immediately following a closed-door briefing with Albright, Defense
Secretary William Cohen and other members of Clinton's national
security team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be briefed more, we need to be advised what the
risks are,'' Lott said, ``and the American people need to have a
better understanding of what the United States national security
interests are, if any.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lott stopped short of saying he would oppose strikes,
others did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more convinced than ever that this is a mistake at this
time,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. ``I am very firm
that I will oppose action in Kosovo until there is a clear peace
agreement and until we know what the mission is, we know what is
expected of our troops, how many it will take, what it will cost,
and what our timetable will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House maintains that it does not need congressional
approval for U.S. forces to participate in NATO air strikes against
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed an activation order formally authorizing U.S.
participation in such strikes last October. That move spurred
Milosevic to agree to a set of peace accords -- including
withdrawing military forces from Kosovo and ending aggression
against ethnic Albanians there -- that the Serbs have since
violated.
</P>
<P>
   While part of Serbia's territory, Kosovo has been a tinderbox
for years. Majority Albanians largely favor independence. Under the
U.S.-backed peace accord Kosovar Albanians signed Thursday, Kosovo
would be granted autonomy -- the same status it enjoyed until 1989
as part of the former Yugoslavia -- but not full independence.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles in Kosovo loosely mirror those in nearby Bosnia,
where NATO air strikes combined with U.S. diplomacy in the fall of
1995 to end three and a half years of ethnic fighting among Serbs
and non-Serbs. A U.S.-led NATO peacekeeping mission has been posted
in Bosnia for the past three years, policing the fragile peace
there.

IN PONDERING A SENATE RACE, MRS. CLINTON STUDIES NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the month since announcing her interest in a U.S.
Senate seat from New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton has discussed her
potential candidacy with 60 influential Democrats, including the
major party chairmen from the suburban and upstate counties crucial
to winning a race.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials say Mrs. Clinton did not hint at her ultimate
decision, but she is systematically studying the politics and
issues of a state where she has never even lived. And a number of
Democrats said Mrs. Clinton has told them she plans to do polling
and that she is looking for ways to raise money even before she
makes a decision on the race. Many officials describe their
conversations with the first lady as lengthy and very detailed
about local issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's obviously been doing her homework,'' said Steve Pigeon,
the Democratic chairman of Erie County, the state's largest
Democratic stronghold outside of New York City. Pigeon said he
spoke by phone to Mrs. Clinton for an hour on Monday night. ``I
have to explain to a lot of candidates who come to me that you
can't view upstate monolithically,'' he said. ``She already knew
the vast differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Pigeon said that Mrs. Clinton told him that she does not want
her delay in making a decision to undercut the ability of other
potential Democratic candidates _ like Rep. Nita Lowey of
Westchester County _ to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the possible impact on other likely
candidates and their ability to raise money if Mrs. Clinton does
not run, many Democrats have been irked by her announcement that
she will not make a decision until ``later this year,'' perhaps as
late as this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In apparent response to that concern, the first lady and her
advisers are exploring fund-raising options: ``She said they're
looking for vehicles to raise money to be used for whoever the
candidate is,'' Pigeon said. ``I think as long as she's raising
money that can be used no matter who runs, whether it's her or
Nita, that can buy some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Election law lawyers said Thursday that such a vehicle might
involve a committee, allowed under federal election law, that would
raise money for an unspecified Senate candidate in donations of up
to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In making her calls, Mrs. Clinton works from a list of 200 names
provided by Harold Ickes, a former White House official and a
veteran of New York politics. Mrs. Clinton's advisers say she has
methodically made her way through the Democratic power structure in
New York state: labor leaders, major county leaders and county
executives, fund-raisers, members of the New York congressional
delegation and leaders of black, Jewish, Hispanic and women's
groups.
</P>
<P>
   She has also had meetings at the White House with a number of
New York officials _ on Thursday with New York City Comptroller
Alan Hevesi and last Friday with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi said that he and the first lady spoke for more than an
hour, half of which he said was spent on Amadou Diallo, the unarmed
African immigrant whose shooting death by the New York City police
has led to protests against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a potential
opponent of Mrs. Clinton. Hevesi said Mrs. Clinton brought up the
case herself but made no comment on Giuliani's handling of it.
</P>
<P>
   Silver met for an hour and 45 minutes with the first lady. In
another indication that Mrs. Clinton may be positioning herself as
a candidate, Silver said that she elaborated on her remarks last
year that a Palestinian state was ``very important'' to Middle East
peace. Giuliani has said her comments were ``a very big mistake,''
while political analysts have said her remarks could give the mayor
a chance to cut into any support she has among Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said Mrs. Clinton told him that her remarks were a
``reflection of her discussions'' with Yitzhak Rabin, the late
Israeli prime minister, ``and that Rabin had told her that ``it was
very difficult to negotiate with a nonentity.'' Silver added that
Mrs. Clinton said her remarks ``are not inconsistent with American
policy.''

</P>
<P>
   Upstate and suburban Democratic party officials, who seem
stunned by the first lady's attention, say Mrs. Clinton hasn't told
them whether she plans to run. But most have come away from
conversations with Mrs. Clinton believing that she will be a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was talking to a political pro,'' said Steve
Paquette, the Onondaga County Democratic chairman, who spoke to
Mrs. Clinton for a half-hour last Thursday. ``I honestly think for
her to be taking the next broad step of calling folks like me,
that's more than sticking your toe in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton makes her calls from the family quarters of the
White House, often at the end of the working day, and sometimes
after a call first from Ickes _ who now has his own Washington
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockland County Democratic chairman, Paul Adler, said last
week that Ickes called and asked him about local issues, and that
Mrs. Clinton then called to talk about property taxes, suburban
development, the regional economy and transportation into New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key here is that they're listening,'' Adler said.
``They're not coming in here and saying, `We ran two races
exceedingly well, shut up, sit back and enjoy the ride.' They're
saying, `How do you think we should do it, what makes your county
tick?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ickes said that Mrs. Clinton is educating herself about New York
through her phone calls, which she makes alone. ``She's finding out
the lay of the political landscape, the lay of the issue
landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most Democratic Party activists are clamoring for Mrs.
Clinton to run, many have also told her the race will be very close
and that she should expect personal attacks for her role in the
Whitewater scandal and her spectacularly profitable trades in the
commodities markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly indicated that it would be a tough race,'' said
Dominic Baranello, the Democratic chairman of the heavily
Republican Suffolk County. Baranello said he told Mrs. Clinton last
week that the Republicans ``would revive many of the issues we've
been hearing about ad nauseum'' and that ``she has to be prepared
to handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local Democratic leaders say they have been taken aback by
the intricacy of Mrs. Clinton's questions. ``She was curious about
why there was a large Jordanian population in Yonkers,'' said
Alpert, the Westchester Democrat, who spoke to Mrs. Clinton for
nearly an hour. ``I did not know the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Alpert also said that he and Mrs. Clinton talked about friends
and colleagues they had in common in Westchester _ Ron Brown, the
late secretary of commerce who was a Democratic district leader in
Mount Vernon in the 1970s; and Toby Nussbaum, a former county
Democratic finance chairman who is married to Bernard Nussbaum, a
friend of Mrs. Clinton's and a former White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Alpert said Mrs. Clinton told him that they are ``relatives''
because of their mutual friends.
</P>
<P>
   On March 5, the president and Mrs. Clinton had a small dinner in
the family quarters of the White House for important New Yorkers.
The guests included Carl McCall, the state comptroller; Randi
Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers;
Dennis Rivera, the president of Local 1199, of the National Health
and Human Service Employees Union; Bill Lynch, longtime adviser to
former Mayor David Dinkins; Victor Kovner, a First Amendment lawyer
and a corporation counsel in the Dinkins administration; and Sarah
Kovner, who is a special assistant to the secretary of health and
human services and Kovner's wife.
</P>
<P>
   The guests were up until 1:30 a.m. having dinner and watching a
movie. Afterward, the New Yorkers slept over at the White House.

A CHANGE OF TENOR FOR TENURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The workplace of the '90s is defined by downsizing,
loss of corporate job security and increased job-hopping.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, the median tenure of workers with their current
employer has been a fairly constant 3.4 to 3.8 years. The most
recent data available, for February 1998, put median tenure at 3.6
years. In other words: Same old same old.
</P>
<P>
   That longevity number, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
applies to all wage and salary workers over age 16. But there are
some deeper wrinkles in the blanket statement when tenure
statistics are analyzed by sex and age.
</P>
<P>
   For example, women traditionally have had shorter job tenures
than men. The gap is narrowing, though. In January 1987, men's
median time on the current job was 4 years and women's was 3 years.
Eleven years later, men's median tenure had slipped to 3.8 years
and women's had increased to 3.4 years.
</P>
<P>
   There's another interesting point in the job record of men age
45 and older. While women in that age category maintained or
increased their median tenure rate in the last 15 years,
45-and-older men have seen their tenure drop.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, men in that age group recorded a median tenure of 12.8
years. By 1998, their median had fallen to 9.4 years. Meanwhile,
women in that age group moved up, from medians of 6.3 years to 7.2
years.
</P>
<P>
   There was an even bigger employment tenure change for men ages
55 to 65. Their median tenure dropped from 15.3 years in 1983 to
11.2 years in 1998. Over the same period, tenure of women in that
age group stayed fairly constant: 9.8 years to 9.6 years.
</P>
<P>
   The employment stability record of the 55-and-over men
reinforced two trends that are definite hallmarks of the '90s:
</P>
<P>
   The downsizing ax _ wielded for cost-cutting reasons _ hit the
older male work force hard. Job fairs and outplacement offices are
full of 40- and 50-something men who were let go from their
well-paying corporate jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, many workers in that demographic category
have opted out of their previous employment by personal choice.
Many of them are financially comfortable because of profit-sharing
and other investments and are eager to explore self-employment
opportunities or enjoy early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   So the tenure median shows a big change, but it isn't easy to
say whether the change is mostly bad news or mostly good news for
those involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics didn't put a value judgment on
the change, but it did note that the shortened tenure defied
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1983 to 1998 ... the share of men (in the work force)
ages 45 to 54 rose from 16 to 20 percent,'' the agency's report
said. ``All other things being equal, this age shift would have
been associated with an increase in median tenure. However, the
median tenure decline from 1983 to 1998 for men in every age group
offset the aging effect.''
</P>
<P>
   As tenure falls _ and experience and institutional memory go
with it _ one wonders about the consequences to organizations. Or
you could consider that it's nice to spread that expertise around.
</P>

IOC CHANGES WAY HOST CITIES ARE TO BE CHOSEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The Austrians had a TravelMate laptop at
their promotional booth in the lobby of the Palais de Beaulieu. If
an International Olympic Committee member wanted a look at
Klagenfurt this week, he could push a button and have a ``virtual
visit.'' But he can't go there _ at least not before the site for
the 2006 Winter Games is chosen in June.
</P>
<P>
   No more trips to bid cities, the IOC has ruled. No more loans,
no more scholarships, no more cosmetic surgery, no more drooling
bulldogs. No more of the cornucopia of improprieties that produced
the most unsavory chapter in modern Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake give-and-take has gone low-budget. ``We can give a
money clip _ with no money in it,'' said Dieter Kalt, general
manager for the Klagenfurt bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   While Kalt was handing out symbolically empty clips Thursday
morning (``Let me corrupt you,'' he joked), the IOC members were
upstairs putting a formal end to the bidding process that brought
them scandal and shame.
</P>
<P>
   Though the full body still will pick the 2006 host city at its
next meeting in Seoul, it will choose from only two finalists
picked 30 minutes earlier by a 16-member panel (only 11 of them IOC
members) assembled that morning.
</P>
<P>
   For information, they will rely solely on a detailed report from
the IOC's site evaluation committee and a one-hour presentation
from each city. No visits _ period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, really, that's enough,'' stated IOC president Juan
Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, insist most of the six European candidates for 2006, who
claim that the no-visit rule gives a huge advantage to Sion, the
Swiss town that was a runner-up to Salt Lake last time. Sion got to
entertain roughly 70 IOC members under the old cashmere-and-caviar
rules. Nobody can do anything close this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can send them a book, but it is not the same thing,'' says
Marco San Pietro, international relations director for the Turin
committee. ``They cannot taste our wine or our food.''
</P>
<P>
   Turin, which has never bid before, was counting on wooing the
Lords of the Rings in person and pointing out that Italy's auto
capital has mountains nearby. ``Turin is not well known,'' says San
Pietro. ``It is perceived as an industrial city, the home of
Fiat.''
</P>
<P>
   Finland, bidding with the Norwegians, wanted to show that
Lillehammer is a long walk from Helsinki but a short flight.
Klagenfurt, which is pushing an unprecedented three-country Games
involving Austria, Italy, and Slovenia, wanted to prove it could
handle the complex logistics of a `bid without borders'.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show them that you could have breakfast in
Klagenfurt, lunch in Tarvisio, and dinner in Kranjska Gora,'' says
international relations director Petra Oberrauner. ``Now, they
cannot see our hospitality.''
</P>
<P>
   The H-word is taboo in the post-Salt Lake era and the 2006
cities grudgingly accept that. ``They all understand the crisis
we're in,'' says IOC vice president Richard Pound of Canada. ``They
understand that visits are now regarded as anathema by almost
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The visits led to the ski vacations, which led to the
scholarships, which led to the five-figure payoffs that has torn
the IOC apart and produced the most radical reforms in its 105
years.
</P>
<P>
   Besides expelling six members Wednesday beyond the four who had
already resigned, the IOC, as expected, Thursday unanimously pushed
through a series of changes that will open up what has always been
a private club to global scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the month, the IOC will name both an independent
ethics panel and a reform commission (half of its members
outsiders) that will recommend changes in everything from how the
IOC chooses its members to how it distributes its money. Thursday,
the IOC posted its interim financial audit on the Internet
(www.olympic.org) for the world to pore over. ``We promised to
clean our house and begin reforms,'' said Samaranch. ``I think we
kept our word.''
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown on bid cities, Samaranch said, was both necessary
and overdue. ``The system of visits was a very bad system,'' he
said. ``So we cancel the system.''
</P>
<P>
   A 16-member panel, picked the morning of the vote in Seoul in
June, will narrow the six bid cities (Sion; Turin; Helsinki;
Klagenfurt; Zakopane, Poland; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia) to two
finalists. The entire 100-plus IOC membership will choose the
winner. The panel will include: Samaranch, IOC dean Joao Havelange,
eight other IOC members, the chairman of the IOC's site evaluation
commission, one representative from both the winter sports
federations and the national Olympic committees, and three
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the IOC chose a winter site, in Budapest four
years ago, the Salt Lake City bidders brought nearly $50,000 for
last-minute lobbying. This week, Turin was handing out red silk
ties (``only worth $30,'' San Pietro insisted) and pens. And
Klagenfurt offered ``virtually'' nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Oberrauner said Thursday, clicking on a laptop map.
``Here is a 360-degree view of our downhill site. Want me to zoom
in?''

TOBIN NAMED PRESIDENT OF BOSTON SCIENTIFIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than three months after dismissing speculation that he
might be a candidate for chief operating officer at Boston
Scientific Corp., James R. Tobin Thursday was named the company's
president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, former chief executive of Biogen, joins the Natick, Mass.
medical devices company immediately. His appointment helped push
Boston Scientific stock up 4 1/2 Thursday to close at 38.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific has had its difficulties, among them a product
recall, recent accounting problems in Japan, and a US Justice
Department investigation. The company manufactures minimally
invasive devices used in cardiology and gastrointerology surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin's decision to join Boston Scientific follows his surprise
resignation from Biogen Inc. last Dec. 23. That news sent Biogen
shares down eight percent and put a spotlight on Tobin's business
relationship with James Vincent, Biogen's strong-willed chairman
who had rescued the company from near bankruptcy in 1985. Vincent
ran the company until Tobin, who joined Biogen in 1994, took over
as president in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although they publicly agreed on the strategy for running the
company, sources had said Tobin, 54, felt his decisions were being
second-guessed by Vincent. Differences in management styles and
decision-making finally led to a showdown: in the end, Biogen's
board of directors sided with Vincent, prompting Tobin to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in December, some Wall Street analysts suggested that I
ought to consider Boston Scientific, which was looking for a
president,'' said Tobin, ``but it was not until mid-January that I
got a call from a headhunter and another analyst who said I really
ought to look at them.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific's founders _ Peter Nicholas and John Abele _
have been running the company together since 1979. And while they
are the largest shareholders, they have created a company that last
year had revenues of $2.23 billion and currently employs about
11,000 people. Yesteday, Tobin said he could see the company's
revenue double, but he declined to say when that could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Nicholas, 62, said he had discussed with Tobin the
reasons for his departure from Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't second-guess my management,'' said Nicholas. ``I work
with people, and I think Jim Tobin's approach is the same as mine.
But this change should not be viewed as Pete Nicholas' swan song. I
will be involved in many different ways. I will continue to focus
on long-term issues and strategies and be a partner with Jim,
responsive to the different ways he chooses to rely on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of Thursday's announcement, several Wall Street
firms raised their ratings on Boston Scientific to a ``buy'' from a
``hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin's appointment ``is exactly what they need,'' said Robert
Faulkner of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, who was among the Wall Street
analysts who changed their Boston Scientific rating. ``He has a
reputation for being honest, a straight shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin _ who prior to joining Biogen spent 21 years at
health-care company Baxter International and rose to its number two
spot as president _ acknowledged that his employment contract with
Boston Scientific is significantly different than his Biogen
contract.
</P>
<P>
   At Biogen, if Tobin was not named president by a certain date in
1997, Biogen was to pay him a considerable amount of money. Biogen
did fulfill its contract.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, there is no such stipulation with Boston
Scientific, said Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am dealing with very different people here,'' said Tobin,
declining to discuss his relationship with Vincent. ``This time, I
sort of looked Pete in the eye and asked whether we can trust each
other. The answer for me was yes. That is all it took.''

 &HT;    Unnatural `Forces'
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The title ``Forces of Nature'' refers to the
streak of natural phenomena that prevents Ben Affleck from reaching
his wedding and Sandra Bullock from reaching her young son across
country. An errant goose aborts their flight. There's a train
mishap. Rain. Fire. Hurricane. By mid-movie, you'll pray for a
tidal wave to swallow them up and flush them to the bottom of the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   But Mother Nature rarely is so kind. Instead, she inflicts one
more natural force on the hapless, dentally blessed couple _ that
kooky cyclone called love.
</P>
<P>
   Call FEMA: There's a federal disaster area in a theater near
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces of Nature'' is a screwball love story punched up with a
visual panache that's just plain screwy. Director Bronwen Hughes
(``Harriet the Spy'') appears to have rigged the camera to a bungee
cord and mistakes gratuitous oblique angles and close-ups for
clever use of cinematic grammar. It's more like cinematic pig
Latin. But, boy, she sure has fun with those blue lens filters!
</P>
<P>
   In ``Forces,'' as in screwball comedy, bickering opposites are
launched like pinballs on a journey of adorable misadventures. They
pull through tribulations as an unwitting team, and soon the
friction between them blunts their spiky differences.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next is obvious, and never more so than in this
movie. Just when they're tearing into each other and things are
getting lively, Affleck and Bullock melt into a gooey snooky
session, and heavy nostril-breathing ensues. Affleck's poor fiancee
(Maura Tierney) is shown moping at home getting drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Lawrence's anemic script owes plenty to those querulous
romantic larks of yore _ ``It Happened One Night'' and ``The Lady
Eve'' are classic blueprints. But that implies that the movie
sweeps us into its vortex of comic cutes, blowing us around in its
giddy thrall. Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   When Affleck's staid book-blurb writer and Bullock's zany
freespirit find themselves stranded at the airport after the goose
goof, their wild odyssey commences. The road movie template is
abused so they can find themselves in planes, trains and
automobiles, not to mention a kitschy carnival ride, a tour bus
filled with lusty geriatrics, the plastic wonderworld of Kmart, a
swimming pool (with their clothes on), and a gay bar, because we
all know how funny gay people are.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock _ playing perhaps the most unconvincing wacky girl ever
put to film, despite the wicked tattoo on her belly and the way she
sticks her tongue out all crazy _ is the unbound id to Affleck's
superego. His decorous veneer starts to crack when she cajoles him
to do Tarzan yells from the top of a train. Depending on your mood,
it's a fun little moment, or the end of courtship as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   A theory: Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck are not actors. They
are mugs whose portrayals amount to smartly delivered lines,
strategic smirks, arch eye-play and fashionable haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   Little is going on here behind the porcelain masks; the whir of
thought, of actually etching and nailing a role, is supplanted by
the thud of tics being trotted out. They are thespian hydroplanes,
grazing emotional surfaces, and flashing those magnificent teeth
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing natural about it. It's just forced.

 &HT;    Everyone else at film fest is relaxed, but I'm exhausted
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ About two weeks ago, I kissed my life on the
cheek, said bon voyage and sent it on a jet plane that would circle
the balmy skies in a holding pattern until Saturday, the final day
of the South by Southwest Film Festival. It lands tomorrow. We will
party.
</P>
<P>
   If you swallowed that metaphor, you probably tasted self-pity
with a dash of whining. There are 164 films at the festival and
dozens of celebrities in attendance. So I have been very busy and I
am tired and I would like your sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, SXSW Film Festival executive producer Nancy Schafer
is smiling. There she is amid the logistic hubbub, laughing into
her walkie-talkie and saying hi to folks in a tone that bespeaks
serenity. All she's missing is a party hat. I hate her.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer's job is roughly 398 times harder than mine at this time
of year. So what gives? Were her brain cells frizzled from watching
hyped festival feature ``Desert Blue'' more than once? (Note to
Christina Ricci: You make a lot of indie films. Quality control,
Christina, quality control.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good,'' says Schafer. ``Things are pretty
relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right on that count. A slow-motion calm permeates this
year's bash. Registrants don't look so lost and harried, and there
seems to be fewer of them eddying through the Austin Convention
Center. That's an illusion, since 400 more registrants are here
than last year, knocking the total to 2,200 _ 200 more than Schafer
forecasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so relaxed because they know the drill,'' she
explains. ``They're teaching new registrants, and that gives the
vibe of it being easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Panel attendance might be thinner, she says, because daily
screenings are siphoning off big crowds. This year boasts ``tons
more'' movie sellouts, including the 10 a.m. weekend shows, a
first. All shows at the Paramount Theatre are getting crowds of
1,000-plus. Even shorts programs are selling out. ``We've never had
that,'' says Schafer.
</P>
<P>
   And the capacity crowds are liking what they see. ``The buzz on
the films is amazing. I'm hearing across the board that the movies
are good,'' Schafer says.
</P>
<P>
   Buzzed-about features include ``Spent,'' ``Dill Scallion'' and
``Standing on Fishes.'' In documentaries, ``Wadd: The Life and
Times of John C. Holmes,'' ``Home Page'' and ``The Accident'' are
word-of-mouth hits.
</P>
<P>
   Just when I was planning to write how fall's Austin Film
Festival surpasses SXSW in glamour and celebrity voltage, along
comes the splashy ``EDtv'' premiere Wednesday at the Paramount.
Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson, Ron Howard, Elizabeth Hurley
and others took the city by storm and reduced me to Liz Smith for a
day.
</P>
<P>
   (It was worth it. Hurley and I have big plans. She doesn't know
it yet, but she'll be delighted.)
</P>
<P>
   A bed-ridden Quentin Tarantino was a no-show to the groans of
little boys all over. He was supposed to introduce movies at the
Jack Hill retrospective, with Hill and actor Sid Haig, who starred
in such Hill exploitation flicks as ``The Big Doll House.'' Jack's
films might be over-the-Hill, considering the watery turnout for
Sunday's screening of ``The Big Doll House.'' Monday's outdoor Hill
screening at GSD&AMP;M, however, hauled 'em in.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer's already winding up for SXSW 2000, which she expects to
be bigger than ever. I'm winding down, waiting for a plane.

INCOME TAX PLAN STILL ALIVE IN N.H. SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMINEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N. H. _ No accord was reached Thursday as New
Hampshire's legislature continued to look for a way to avert an
impending school funding crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee Thursday rejected every option
bought before it save the one Gov. Jeanne Shaheen has threatened to
veto _ a plan that includes the state's first income tax.
</P>
<P>
   That controversial bill, which passed the more conservative
House by a narrow margin earlier this month, calls for a 4 percent
personal income tax combined with a $6 per $1,000 valuation
statewide property tax. The committee will take it up when it
reconvenes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member committee rejected two other plans: a call for
a 4 percent sales tax or a plan backed by Shaheen. Shaheen's
proposal includes a statewide property tax, an increase in the
state's Business Profits Tax by one point to 8 percent, an
estimated $200 million from opening the state up to video slot
machines at eight of the state's race tracks and grand hotels and
an increase in liquor and cigarette taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Most senators found something to hate in Shaheen's grab bag of
taxes. ``Video slot machines have earned the reputation of being
the crack cocaine of gambling for good reason,'' said Sen. Clifton
Below, one of the sponsors of the income tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   The finance committee is expected to pass some form of an income
tax bill along to the full Senate for consideration on Tuesday. If
the Senate approves a bill different from the House's, which most
observers expect, it would then go to a House-Senate conference
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The full senate could also decide to test Shaheen's resolve by
passing the original income tax bill which would send it to her
desk. ``They think we will be in a crisis mode when the bill gets
to the governor and she won't veto it but she will,'' Reardon said.
</P>
<P>
   All sides agree that only the delusional could hope for an
override of the popular governor's veto in the house. ``Not even if
the schools closed,'' said Republican Rep. Elizabeth Hager, a prime
sponsor of the income tax bill. ``I hope that something can be
worked out before it gets to that,'' Hager said.

SINGLE-BUYER SALE OF FLEET-BANKBOS BRANCHES OPPOSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Eight Massachusetts congressmen said Thursday they
would ``oppose vigorously'' any deal in which bank branches sold
off as part of the Fleet-BankBoston merger go to one large buyer,
rather than to a variety of buyers that includes small and
community-oriented banks.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers, in a letter to federal banking regulators and to
Fleet and BankBoston, also urged that the merged bank show a
greater commitment to affordable housing and to local economic
development than they make today.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp. earlier this
week announced a $16 billion merger, which will produce the
nation's eighth-largest bank and a regional powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two banks currently provide the bulk of competition
in many communities, they are expected to sell off about 270
branches across New England. Analysts say it could be one of the
largest bank divestitures in US history.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts lawmakers, in their letter to the banks and to
five regulatory agencies, asked for ``the strictest scrutiny'' of
the merger for its effects on competition.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have said that the most robust competition to the
merged Fleet Boston Corp. would arise if a single, large bank
bought the branches sold by Fleet and BankBoston. But the
Massachusetts lawmakers specifically rejected that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who led
the letter-writing effort, said that big borrowers are already
well-served by large banks, but that many smaller borrowers want to
work with the small banks that might be hurt financially when
surrounded by ever-larger rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the local officials we deal with, and the smaller
business people, say they'd like some smaller banks to deal with,''
Frank said. ``The sense we have is that (the merger) will make it
harder for some of our smaller banks to stay alive. We're not in
the business of protecting smaller banks, but of protecting people
who feel comfortable borrowing from smaller banks.''
</P>
<P>
   The best outcome, he said, would be ``a mix of big and little
banks. And since we're now going to have one very big bank, we
don't want a second pretty big bank. What we want is a lot of
strong little banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank said that while the lawmakers ``do not have a button we
can push'' to reverse regulatory decisions, they can influence the
outcome because they have a role in approving a range of requests
that the Justice Department, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
and other regulators make of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   James Mahoney, a Fleet spokesman, said that the banks' plan for
divesting branches must be approved by federal regulators.
``There's a big federal role,'' he said. But he would not discuss
which banks are potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've identified the scope of the divestiture, and with regard
to the actual sale, we would decline to comment pending further
discussions with regulators,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, the lawmakers also said that companies often
talk up the ``synergy'' that a merger produces -- the notion that
two firms together form something greater than the sum of their
parts. They asked the banks to commit to producing the same synergy
in adhering to the Community Reinvestment Act, a federal law that
requires banks to make loans and provide other services to spur
local economic development.
</P>
<P>
   The merger should improve ``the banks' performance in assisting
with the vital issues of affordable housing and community economic
development,'' the lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   They also asked the banks to keep layoffs to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said that many of the 5,000 projected job cuts at Fleet
and BankBoston will be accomplished through attrition and by not
filling positions that are currently vacant. He said the banks
would continue community reinvestment at their current levels, even
though their combined market share will be smaller after selling
the 270 branches.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Frank, the the letter was signed by
Representatives William Delahunt, Jim McGovern, Martin Meehan,
Michael Capuano, John Olver, John Tierney, and Edward Markey. All
are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Capuano are members of the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The letter went to Fleet chief executive Terrance Murray,
BankBoston chief executive Charles Gifford, and to the top
officials at the Justice Department, the Treasury Department, the
Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the
Comptroller of the Currency.

FAMILY SEEKS SUIT IN '61 RADIATION TREATMENT DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- By all accounts, George Heinrich died a painful death.
Afflicted with a fast-growing brain tumor, Heinrich underwent an
experimental treatment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in 1961 that scorched healthy brain tissue even as it destroyed the
tumor, hastening his death rather than saving him.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight years later a federal judge heard Thursday why
Heinrich's family should be allowed to sue MIT, Massachusetts
General Hospital and others involved in Heinrich's treatment
despite the passage of so much time. The family charged that
Heinrich's doctors used him and up to 236 others as human guinea
pigs in dangerous experiments without telling them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they were doing was research, not medicine,'' said
Anthony Roisman, who represents Heinrich's widow as well as the
families of three other patients who received the controversial
treatment, called boron neutron capture therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Massachusetts General Hospital and Dr. William
Sweet, the retired chief of neurosurgery who treated Heinrich,
called on US District Court Judge William G. Young to dismiss the
whole case, arguing that it was decades too late. They noted that
Massachusetts law in 1961 required malpractice claims to be filed
within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they defended the treatment of Heinrich and the others
as a good faith effort to save patients who had a disease that
probably would have killed them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that something is experimental or developmental
doesn't mean it's not treatment,'' explained Joseph Doherty, who
represented Sweet and Massachusetts General Hospital. ``Dr. Sweet
was one of the top neurosurgeons in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't satisfy family members who believe doctors they
trusted exposed their loved ones to painful treatments that had no
prospect of making them better. They said they didn't suspect
deception until a presidential commission questioned the ethics of
the research in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully Boston will see what has been hidden all these
years,'' said Walter Van Dyke, who was two when his father died in
1957 after receiving boron neutron capture therapy at Brookhaven
National Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y., where Sweet also
administered the tumor treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The complicated lawsuit, which also names Brookhaven and several
other parties, re-opens a sad chapter in the history of nuclear
medicine when Sweet and Brookhaven's Lee Edward Farr led a team
that tried, without success, to find a way to halt the spread of an
aggressive cancer called glioblastoma multiforme.
</P>
<P>
   From 1951 to 1961, the researchers injected desperately ill
patients with varying concentrations of boron, a chemical that
concentrates in brain tumors. Then, they exposed the chemicals to a
beam of neutrons from the nuclear reactor at MIT or Brookhaven,
causing a mini-nuclear reaction that they hoped would destroy the
tumors.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers could not confine the damage to the tumors,
resulting in extensive damage to healthy tissue and blood vessels
that may have killed at least 10 patients, including Heinrich,
according to the lawsuit. The protocol finally ended in 1961 after
one patient died of brain swelling two weeks after her treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Roisman said Sweet and his associates may have treated 66
patients with boron neutron capture therapy without informing them
that the procedure was highly experimental. In addition, he said
one memo shows the researchers had funding to inject 160 people
with boron, and records show they injected uranium into another 11
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet ``lied to us. He said he could save George's life if we
sent him to the reactor,'' said Evelynn Heinrich. Instead, George
Heinrich, a 35-year-old father of a young daughter, died a
lingering death four months later.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet, now in his late 80s, agreed in a 1995 interview that the
boron neutron capture therapy had failed, but he did not apologize
for his research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes some courage to embark on a highly experimental
procedure . . . instead of settling for a known unhappy outcome,''
Sweet said. He also noted that neurosurgeons have revived boron
neutron capture therapy in the last few years, building on the
results of his earlier work.
</P>
<P>
   And lawyers for all the defendants said it was too late to
second-guess the work of Sweet and Farr, who died last year. Based
on the published studies on boron neutron capture therapy and the
side effects patients suffered, they argued that the families
should have known enough to file a lawsuit at the time of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But Young said the issues were too complex and important to
dismiss from the bench. Instead, he dismissed only one minor claim
in the lawsuit, and gave lawyers 30 days to provide more
information about possible civil rights violations in the
treatments as well as the research at Brookhaven.

   TRADE-REPORT (Washington) _ As U.S. exports continued to fall,
the U.S. trade deficit jumped to a new monthly record of $17
billion in January, fueled by a flood of imports from China that
could stir further protectionist sentiments in Congress. Among the
imports that surged into the United States from China was a huge

<HEADLINE>
EAST GERMANS SECRETLY EXHUMED AND CLEANED GOETHE'S CORPSE IN 1970  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ In a secret operation in 1970, East German scientists
exhumed the body of Goethe, loaded the poet's corpse onto a cart,
transported it to a nearby museum, worked on its preservation for
three weeks and then returned the remains to their crypt in the
city of Weimar.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner Schlichting, an official at the Weimar Classics
Foundation, which oversees the city's cultural heritage, said
Thursday that the operation was undertaken to ``strengthen Goethe's
bones and give his sarcophagus a new lining.'' But, he added,
``nothing else was changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the extraordinary exhumation, carried out at night on
Nov. 2, 1970, by the former Communist state, were reported Thursday
by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   According to Schlichting, a report of the operation and
photographs had lain unnoticed in the National Goethe Museum in
Weimar for the last 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Thursday printed photographs of
Goethe's vacated stone coffin and a detailed account of the
scientists' findings drawn from ``Report Concerning the Inspection,
Removal, Maceration and Return of Goethe's Mortal Remains in
November 1970.''
</P>
<P>
   The term ``maceration'' refers to the technique used by the
scientists. Remaining fragments of Goethe's flesh were stripped
from the corpse by steeping in fluids before the poet's bones were
cleaned and strengthened with a special preserving agent,
Schlichting said.
</P>
<P>
   Even by the standards of an East German state that was a master
of cloak-and-dagger spy operations, the nocturnal removal of
Goethe's body from its tomb, clandestine transport on a cart, and
later treatment with various chemicals appears outlandish.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe, whose most famous work, ``Faust,'' tells of one man's
pact with the Devil, has lain since his death in 1832 in a crypt
that also contains the corpse of the great poet and playwright
Friedrich von Schiller, who died in 1805.
</P>
<P>
   Like Martin Luther and Frederick the Great, Goethe was among the
great figures of German history that the former East German state
used to buttress the patriotism of its citizens and its claims to
represent the true Germany beside a ``decadent'' West Germany. The
tombs of all three men lie in what was East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The report makes clear that the scientists considered preserving
Goethe's remains in a glass coffin, like Lenin's, but later
abandoned the idea as impractical, before carting the corpse back
to its tomb by night.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of Goethe's grooming comes at a delicate time.
Weimar has embarked on a series of celebrations and performances to
mark the 250th anniversary of Goethe's birth and the city's
selection by European Union culture ministers as Europe's
``cultural capital'' for 1999. It is the first city of the former
Soviet bloc to be honored in this way.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the maceration and bone-reinforcement, an intricate
operation was undertaken to strengthen the laurel wreath that was
found attached to Goethe's skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaves of the laurel wreath were washed and disinfected in
alcohol,'' the report said, before being treated in a solution to
``protect them against mold.'' Later, ``the dried leaves were
flattened between warmed polyethylene films.''
</P>
<P>
   The wreath was then reattached to Goethe's skull, a cranium that
had conjured up some of the greatest literary works known to man,
but was found by the scientists to contain only ``a dustlike
mass.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said that seven people, including the former rector
of Jena University and a director of the Museum of Early History in
Weimar, carried out the work on Goethe's corpse. They loaded his
body onto a cart as night fell on Nov. 2, 1970, and pulled the
contraption the short distance to the Goethe museum.
</P>
<P>
   None of the people involved in the operation could be reached
for comment. It was unclear how many of them, if any, are still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Weimar officials said the report, which had been kept in the
anatomy department of the museum, was found last year, but its
existence was not revealed until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that people would not dream of doing
today,'' said Angela Jahn, a spokeswoman for the Weimar Classics
Foundation. ``But it was simply an attempt to preserve for eternity
the mortal remains of a great poet.''
</P>
<P>
   The operation had begun as an attempt to repair a broken lock on
the sarcophagus, but when the advanced state of decomposition of
Goethe's remains was discovered, a more elaborate project was
devised, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It added that the poet's skeleton was 5 feet 5{ inches long,
giving him a probable living height of 5 ft 6{ inches, about
average for his time.
</P>
<P>
   One other alteration was made to Goethe's remains, the report
said. His shroud was removed and sent to Berlin, then the East
German capital, for examination.
</P>
<P>
   But Communist bureaucracies being what they were, the
examination was delayed. As a result, the shroud did not return in
time to be reburied along with Goethe's rehabilitated corpse. The
garment was kept hidden in the Schiller museum in Weimar, where it
remains today.
</P>
<P>
   In the former East Germany, Weimar was a major tourist
attraction, known as the ``Kulturstadt,'' or city of culture.
</P>
<P>
   During the 18th and 19th centuries, the city attracted some of
Europe's greatest writers and composers, including Goethe, Schiller
and Liszt. Later, Walter Gropius, the founder of the Bauhaus school
of architecture, lived in the city that was also the birthplace in
1919 of modern Germany's first, and ill-fated, democratic republic.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, doubts have been expressed by some historians
and scientists over the authenticity of Schiller's skull. But
authorities in Weimar have rejected repeated calls for an
exhumation and scientific analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the East German scientists said Goethe's high
forehead, pointed chin and sharp nose were strikingly similar to
the portrait of him painted at the time of his death by Friedrich
Preller.
</P>
<P>
   Weimar's tangled history _ more tangled still in light of the
posthumous prettifying of the poet _ was darkened by its role
during World War II. The concentration camp of Buchenwald, where
60,000 people died under Hitler, lies five miles from the town.
</P>
<P>
   Among the commemorations in Weimar planned for this year of the
250th anniversary of Goethe's birth on Aug. 28, 1749, are a
performance of ``The Damnation of Faust'' by the German National
Theater, as well as a rap version of ``Faust'' and _ in a twist not
untypical of Germany's sometimes awkward striving to reconcile the
light and dark of its history _ an exhibition of Goethe's drawings
at Buchenwald.

JUST ANOTHER NFL SHAKEDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Please, call a doc, I'm bent over in a fetal
position, nearly unconscious from the uncontrollable seizures of
laughter I've been having from the hilarity emanating from the NFL
comedy show staged earlier this week in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   As you might have heard, the NFL, God bless its kindly souls,
finally decided to grant Los Angeles an expansion franchise, but
attached a few conditions to the offering that will be good for six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the NFL was quite vague about the specificity of
these conditions, but you need not be an attorney for Bill Clinton,
or even a Paul Tagliabue, to figure out that L.A. is not so subtly
being shaken down for the kind of money _ $600 million in franchise
fees _ that recently was wrangled out of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the NFL is asking L.A. to do what it has a sacred
history of doing worst getting a bunch of disparate groups to pool
their financial resources and agree to work together for the common
good of the community.
</P>
<P>
   There's a better chance of Leno and Letterman one day co-hosting
a late-night television talk show, even a honest decision being
rendered in a Don King-promoted heavyweight title fight before that
would happen.
</P>
<P>
   There are even reports that L.A.'s beloved mayor, Richard
Riordan, is trying to get Michael Ovitz to defect from Carson and
join the Ed Roski-Eli Broad New Coliseum group.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, the chances of Michael Ovitz, whose ego extends even
beyond his massive bank account, agreeing to becoming a secondary
player in any L.A. pro football enterprise is roughly tantamount,
say, to his once agreeing to turn down the $100 million he received
from Disney after being fired by Michael Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz is not a guy with a history of sharing adulation with
other people _ ask Michael Eisner _ and you can be sure he will do
everything within his power to keep his Carson dream alive.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is coyly dangling the threat of Houston over L.A., which
has me shaking in my Guccis.
</P>
<P>
   It won't surprise me if the NFL reluctantly winds up awarding
that sterling Texas city with an expansion franchise if L.A. is
unable to meet its financial obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL knows that Houston is quite willing to fork over the
same inflated amount that Cleveland did, and that its owners again
would then be able to cut up around $20 million each among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I just can't envision all the disparate parties in this area
suddenly forming a peaceful alliance, nor can I see the Coliseum,
with its sordid political history of losing the Rams, Raiders and
UCLA, suddenly becoming a bastion of tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   I just can't envision L.A. coming up with the public funding
that the NFL says will be needed for a new franchise, and I'm not
sure it should.
</P>
<P>
   I just can't envision my ceaseless laughter disappearing until
the NFL pulls back its veiled threats against L.A. and realizes we
here aren't like the desperate burghers of Cleveland. We'll take an
NFL team, fine, but none of the money for it will be subsidized by
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, we can survive nicely without professional football,
as we have for the past four years. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I'd rather see the Raiders yes, the Raiders! return than an
expansion franchise. L.A. may have the most intolerant athletic
fans in America. How do you think they'll react to watching an
inferior brand of football for several years, an inevitability for
expansion franchises with the notable exception of Jacksonville.
...
</P>
<P>
   I get the distinct impression from reading Al Davis' quotes out
of Phoenix that he is maniacally desperate to get his Raiders out
of Oakland and return to L.A. What a shock!. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I don't think the new version of instant replay goes far enough.
I think all suspect calls should be scrutinized, even if there are
more than two before the two-minute warning of each half. And
allowing the referee on the field to determine the outcome of
suspect calls is like allowing a defense attorney to serve as a
jury foreman in a trial for one of his clients. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas sources tell me the casinos have cut off Dennis
Rodman's credit because his gambling markers now exceed seven
figures. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles sources tell me that Rodman's wagering excesses
don't cause him nearly as much private grief as does the stormy
relationship he has with his pint-sized wife, Carmen Electra. They
tell me he's hopelessly smitten by her. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Laker sources tell me that, despite Rodman's absence, his
teammates aren't too upset with him, and are willing to welcome him
back without rancor. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I've been asking Kevin Malone the moment he got rid of Charles
Johnson and brought in Todd Hundley who would be doing the catching
for the Dodgers this season. I still want to know. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I've been told by various people that the relationship Don King
has with Bob Lee, the IBF president who assigned the incompetent
Jean Williams to work the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis fight, is
far cozier than the one he long has had with the WBC president,
Jose Sulaiman. . . .
</P>
<P>
   People don't change. Believe me, they don't. Latest example:
Gary Sheffield. . . .
</P>
<P>
   This NCAA Tournament to me is a preordained skit in which we all
know that Duke will emerge victorious at the end. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I've come to the conclusion that New York has to be the most
shamelessly provincial city in America after three days of reading
insufferable drivel in the tabloids about how the Holyfield-Lewis
was being held at the boxing mecca, Madison Square Garden. Please,
the Garden hadn't had a truly major fight in 27 years, while Las
Vegas has had hundreds of them during that span. . . .
</P>
<P>
   A guy with intimate knowledge of the New York Mets told me that
it's all set up for the brilliant Seattle shortstop, Alex
Rodriguez, to join the Mets for the 2001 season. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It's now apparent that the most tragic development of the season
for the Clippers came the moment the NBA lockout was resolved. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   To me, the Clippers ruined what could have been the most
inglorious season in the history of professional athletics last
week with their regrettable win against the Sacramento Kings. So
they got to do a cameo on the Leno Show the next evening? Big deal.
They would have established their own unique sporting legacy had
they only gone winless the entire season, a record Donald T. (As In
Terrific) Sterling's ghastly franchise richly deserves. ...

POLITICALLY IN A JAM, SHAHEEN STILL PLEASES VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ It seems like just about everyone is mad at
Jeanne Shaheen, the popular Democratic governor with the shy smile,
soft voice and granite gaze.
</P>
<P>
   As Shaheen and the state legislature struggle to find a new way
to pay for public schools that passes constitutional muster, her
leadership and her motives are being questioned by Democrats and
Republicans alike, including friends and financial supporters who
helped her win two statewide elections in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's certainly on the dunking stool these days,'' said
Representative Peter Burling, the House Minority Leader from
Cornish who supports a statewide income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen faces facing a court-imposed April 1 deadline to find an
equitable way to fund schools, which will mean an annual bill near
$1 billion, in a state notorious for its hatred of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   There is danger for Shaheen in every direction. When she offered
a plan last year, Republicans criticized her and the court shot it
down. When she hung back this year, Republicans and Democrats
condemned her lack of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, when she offered up a new plan, the plan was
quickly picked apart by critics of every political persuasion. She
suggested a new tax on businesses, and business doesn't like it.
She called for expanding video gambling, and good government types
are appalled. She proposed a statewide property tax, and proponents
of an income tax are upset.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more of her friends and supporters are becoming
disillusioned, complaining that Shaheen refuses to spend any
political capital to forge a solution, that she is only considering
her personal political possibilities _ a run for the US Senate,
perhaps, or even the vice presidency _ rather than what's best for
the children of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaheen, who remains wildly popular outside the state's
tight political circles, gives a tight smile and shrugs off the
criticism, resolute in the course she is charting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philosophically, I don't think an income tax would be good for
New Hampshire,'' Shaheen said Thursday during an interview in her
State House office. ``It's part of the state's identity that we
haven't had a sales or income tax and it's been good for the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   During each of her gubernatorial campaigns, Shaheen took the
famous New Hampshire pledge, promising voters she would not support
any broad-based taxes, including a statewide property tax, a sales
tax and an income tax. So far, though, she has jettisoned her
opposition to a property tax and said that she could support a
sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   But the 52-year old former school teacher with a masters degree
in political science has adamantly refused to give in to members of
her own party who say that an income tax is the most equitable way
to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't like an income tax because they feel like, `This
is my money, I earned it and why is the government taking it from
me,' '' said Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   That explanation does nothing to appease Howard M. Moffett, a
Concord attorney, who has given Shaheen money and even co-sponsored
a fund-raiser for her last year. He was outraged after Shaheen said
she would support an amendment to the New Hampshire constitution
that would have effectively reversed the court order, and refused
to attend a fundraiser for her, even though Moffett's name was
printed on the invitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard for me to explain how deeply disappointed I
have been in what I believe is her lack of leadership on this
school funding issue,'' said Moffett. ``There are a lot of people
who feel the way I do,'' he said. ``If she tried to talk to all of
us she wouldn't get anything else done.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the criticism of Shaheen reflects today's cynicism
toward politicians and a belief that campaign promises are made to
be broken. Many Democrats and many Republicans thought Shaheen
intended to walk away from the pledge when she took it in 1996 and
even when she repeated it in 1998. Democrats who support the income
tax thought she secretly agreed with them.
</P>
<P>
   If the criticism hurts, Shaheen doesn't show it. She just smiles
and grimaces and rolls her eyes at some of the zingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were some people who thought when I took the
pledge I did it for political expedience, not because I felt that
way,'' she explained. ``Once I got a chance, boy, I was going to
pass that income tax, just let me get that chance. And they were
wrong, that hasn't been my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, she insisted, is her goal to find another job in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being governor of New Hampshire, I'm having a great
time,'' said Shaheen, the mother of three daughters who lives in
Madbury. ``I'm not interested in thinking about anything else right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The voters are happy having her where she is as well. A poll by
the Concord Monitor this week put her approval rating at 66
percent. But the deadline, and with it the promise of more chaos on
an issue that voters value highly, is quickly approaching. Already,
some teachers are beginning to receive pink lay-off slips for the
following school year because the funding has not been agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   In political circles, along with the strains of anger and
frustration toward the governor, there is also sympathy for the
woman who helped mastermind Jimmy Carter and Gary Hart's upset
victories in the state's presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would want to go through the process of having some of
your best friends yell at you?'' asked Burling, the House
Democratic Leader. ``It's not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen's husband, William H. Shaheen, admits that the pressure
and the unkind letters and phone calls from friends does take a
toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, if her policy is right, then I think
those friends will come back,'' he said. ``At the end of the day,
if she's wrong, then they won't come back.''

<P>
   It is one of most common gun accidents: A person picks up a
semiautomatic pistol, takes out the magazine containing the
cartridges and, thinking the weapon is empty, squeezes the trigger
and shoots himself or someone else.
</P>
<P>
   When a semiautomatic's magazine is removed, a round can remain
in the chamber, ready to be fired, and scores of people, from
adults cleaning guns to children playing with them, have died or
been seriously hurt in recent years as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Gun producers have long known of the danger, and some have
responded by building into their guns an inexpensive mechanism
known as a magazine safety. But the fact that many gun makers have
chosen not to use simple devices like magazine safeties and gun
locks is now a focus of a growing wave of lawsuits in which cities
are accusing the firearms industry of making guns needlessly
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   A look at how gun makers have chosen to use, or not use, the
magazine safety provides a glimpse into an industry driven by
unique marketing forces. In the absence of government safety
regulation, different companies set their own standards, and
producers have not sought independent answers about safety issues
or been able to reach internal consensus on them.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the nation's biggest gun maker, Smith &AMP; Wesson, has
incorporated a magazine safety, a mechanism made of a few springs
and a lever that can cost as little as 9 cents, in virtually every
semiautomatic pistol it sold to the public. Other companies have
never used one.
</P>
<P>
   Beretta uses the device in a few models but not others. Some
manufacturers offer it as an option to law enforcement but not to
the public. One manufacturer stamps a warning about the firing
danger onto a pistol. Another puts a caution sticker on the
magazine. Others say nothing on the gun.
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers have a simple response to questions about the
magazine safety, as well as the safety lawsuits: People know that
guns are dangerous, gun owners need training, and they need to keep
weapons away from children. Faced with the prospect of federal
regulation, gun makers recently began to distribute safety locks,
but both the industry and groups like the National Rifle
Association oppose mandatory safety requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We leave it up to each individual company to manufacture what
they think is the safest, highest quality product as they see fit
and leave it to the consumer to buy the gun that best fits their
needs,'' said Andrew Kelley, a spokesman for Sporting Arms and
Ammunition Manufacturers Institute, a trade group in Newtown, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   For every gun maker that cites safety as a reason for using the
magazine device, another contends it could make a gun less
reliable. Other consumer industries form internal task forces to
resolve such debates, or refer them to independent technical
groups, such as Underwriters Laboratories Inc., which have set
standards for products from children's pajamas to hair dryers.
</P>
<P>
   But while the gun industry's group, the Sporting Arms and
Ammunition Institute, has set technical standards for bullets, it
has not researched the value of internal safety devices like the
magazine safety, Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that some accidental shooting deaths
could be prevented if gun owners handled and stored their weapons
more safely. And such deaths have fallen steadily over the last two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in 1996, the most recent year for which federal data are
available, 1,134 people were killed in such incidents, 135 of them
children under 14.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings occur for various reasons. Many involve hunting.
Others happen when a gun is dropped. But a 1991 study by the
General Accounting Office, a congressional agency, found that
nearly a fourth occurred because the person who picked up a gun
thought it was unloaded.
</P>
<P>
   No single device _ and gun makers can choose from many _ can
eliminate such shootings. But the gun industry's scattershot
approach to safety involves producers of inexpensive and costly
guns alike.
</P>
<P>
   For expensive pistols, the marketing chain often starts with
military or police agencies. Gun makers can use their success in
that arena to sell the same weapon to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever gun the cop carries, the civilian aspires to carry,''
said Joseph Cartabona, director of handguns for Colt's
Manufacturing in West Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Many law-enforcement agencies, including the FBI, do not want a
magazine safety. Their reasoning: that being able to fire the
bullet remaining in the chamber could save the life of an officer
who changes his magazine or accidentally releases it during a
gunfight.
</P>
<P>
   But firearms experts who have looked for such cases say they
have found few. Instead, experts like Massad Ayoob, a police
captain who is director of the Lethal Force Institute, a training
academy in Concord, N.H., say they have found more instances where
officers with magazine safeties avoided being shot with their own
guns by ejecting the magazine during a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It acts as a kind of kill button,'' Ayoob said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Between 1988 and 1997, 62 police officers nationwide were killed
with their own weapons, according to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Beretta and Sig Arms do not normally put the safety in their
pistols, but will if law-enforcement agencies want it. Neither
company gives the public that option.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no commercial call for it or request for it,''
said Wesley Lang, the vice president of marketing for Sig Arms,
based in Exeter, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of the device for police work, guns stripped
of safety features for military or police use are then sold to
consumers, who often lack training. Such guns include
semiautomatics made by Glock Inc., which are used by about half of
the country's police departments.
</P>
<P>
   Glock pistols, designed in the early 1980s for the Austrian
military, have also been a big hit with consumers, who now account
for half of all sales. The Glock has several safety features, but
lacks both a magazine safety and a manual safety, the lever found
on many pistols that must be pushed for the gun to fire.
</P>
<P>
   Such mechanical factors combined with poor training may be
behind many accidental deaths and injuries involving Glock pistols.
In the last decade, about 60 accidental shooting lawsuits have been
filed against Glock, of Smyrna, Ga., according to Firearms
Litigation Clearinghouse, an advocacy group in Washington, and the
company says it is facing about 20 such suits, 40 percent of which
involve consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Glock denies any blame for the incidents and it has won all nine
cases that have gone to trial, said the company's general counsel,
Paul Jannuzzo. But it has settled other suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun is the best tool of its kind available, be it for a
policeman or a civilian,'' Jannuzzo said. ``It strikes the proper
balance between safety and usability.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few lawsuits specifically charging that an accidental
shooting resulted from the lack of a magazine safety have gone to
trial, and gun makers have won them. Several more are pending,
including one involving the 1996 death of Ross Mathieu, the
12-year-old boy in Massachusetts shot by a friend who thought a
pistol without its magazine was empty.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last three decades, gun makers have quietly settled
dozens of such cases, say plaintiffs' lawyers and expert witnesses
who have testified for them. Stanton Berg, a firearms consultant in
Minneapolis, said he had been involved in about 30 suits involving
the lack of a magazine safety, nearly all of which were settled.
</P>
<P>
   Another firearms expert, Lama Martin, the president of Forensic
Ballistics Inc., a consulting firm in Bel Air, Md., said he had
been involved in about six cases that were settled. He said that
any gun sold to the public should have at least three devices: a
manual safety, a magazine safety and a safety to prevent the gun
from firing if it is dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average civilian has received no training,'' Martin said.
``He needs all the help he can get.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlements have not prompted the industry to use magazine
safeties. Jeffrey Reh, general counsel of Beretta USA in Accokeek,
Md., which has settled two of those cases, said the magazine safety
has pros and cons.
</P>
<P>
   Reh said the safety can prevent someone from accidentally firing
a gun that they think is unloaded because the magazine is removed.
But deadly accidents have happened with guns that have the safety,
he said, when someone inserted an empty magazine in the pistol.
That disengages the safety and allows the remaining bullet to be
fired.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that a homeowner needing a gun in a hurry for
self-defense might not be able to use it if the gun had a safety
and he fumbled with a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what we call a neutral feature,'' Reh said.
</P>
<P>
   That does not explain why some Beretta guns sold to the public
have magazine safeties and others do not. Reh said none of the guns
made by Beretta in the United States have magazine safeties, but
they are included in Berettas made by Fabbrica D'Armi Pietro
Beretta, an Italian sister company.
</P>
<P>
   Reh said he did not know for certain why the Italian company
used the device, but he said the reason might stem from a 1968
federal law aimed at cheap handguns known as ``Saturday night
specials,'' most of which came from abroad at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The 1968 law, the federal Gun Control Act, imposed a test based
on safety features on imported handguns. But the test did not apply
to guns made in the United States, and domestic producers quickly
moved in to make inexpensive guns that did not meet the import
test.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, some gun makers have moved to make weapons less
dangerous. But within the industry, currents can flow in several
directions.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, virtually every Smith &AMP; Wesson pistol sold to the
public had a magazine safety because the company believed it could
help prevent accidental shootings, said Kenneth Jorgensen, a
spokesman for the gun maker. But several years ago, faced with the
popularity of the Glock, Smith &AMP; Wesson started selling a competing
line of inexpensive pistols known as its ``Sigma'' series.
</P>
<P>
   The new pistol, like the Glock, does not have a magazine safety.
Instead, it bears this warning stamped on the side: ``CAUTION:
Capable of firing with the magazine removed.''

 &HT;    Testimony heard in defense of Texas law charging property owners
liability for crimes
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Her voice was restrained, but Barbara Ayres, who
lost two daughters in Austin's infamous yogurt shop murders in
1991, urged a Senate committee Thursday not to weaken Texas law
that she said helped assure safer work for kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wanted this to happen in this business,'' Ayres told
the subcommittee on technology and business growth. ``No one
does.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said the yogurt shop where her daughters were killed,
with two other girls in a closing-time robbery, trained its
employees only in cleaning the equipment and not safety.
</P>
<P>
   The four teen-agers were shot in the head and burned when the
shop was set afire.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers testified against a tort-reform bill by state Sen. David
Sibley (R-Waco) that would allow juries to calculate in a civil
lawsuit against a business owner how much fault should be
attributed to a criminal. Such lawsuits allege that property owners
failed to protect employees or customers when a danger was
foreseeable.
</P>
<P>
   In the yogurt shop murders, the company that owned the I Can't
Believe It's Yogurt shop and the shopping center owner settled with
Ayres and families of the other girls for $12 million in 1994. The
families alleged lax security when crime had increased in the North
Austin neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the settlement proceeds established a foundation in the
girls' memory _ We Will Not Forget SAJE _ that helps educate
children about safety at work. SAJE refers the victims, Sarah
Harbison, 15; Amy Ayers, 13; Jennifer Harbison, 17; and Eliza
Thomas, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres is the mother of the Harbison girls.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley's bill, backed by the Texas Association of Business &AMP;
Chambers of Commerce, also would allow juries to calculate the
amount of fault for workplace injuries attributed to an employer in
lawsuits brought against product manufacturers or contractors.
Under current law, the employer is immune from such suits because
workplace injuries are covered by the state's worker compensation
program.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Sibley's law told the committee that juries
currently do not figure in any fault that might be the employer's.
The third party then pays the total of the jury's award, even
though the employer might have been responsible too, testified
Austin lawyer Alan Waldrop, who is representing the chambers of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But Hartley Hampton, president of the Texas Trial Lawyers
Association, said the bill could reduce an award to an injured
worker who might not recover as much from workers compensation
insurance _ even if the employer were grossly negligent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a fair share system,'' Hampton said.

 &HT;    Not much networking at Women in Technology International
conference
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Women in Technology International regional
conference in Dallas is another reminder of just how different
high-tech Austin, with its free-wheeling start-ups, and high-tech
Dallas, home to large corporations, really are.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's regional meeting, held in Austin, drew a large
number of women who either entrepreneurs or working at start-up
companies. The hot topics were breaking out on your own and raising
venture capital. The talk in the hallways and over glasses of
Chardonnay at receptions was of stock options and job hopping.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, the scene at the Fairmont Hotel is dominated by
corporate workers wearing matching shirts with their companies'
logos. How to work your way up the management chain is the burning
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Networking _ an art form in Austin _ is in low gear. Considering
that most of the participants are from Texas Instruments Inc. or
Raytheon Systems Co., the opportunities for circulating resumes are
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Christy Jones, a co-founder of Trilogy Software and founder of
pcOrder.com, showed her Austin roots in her breakfast keynote
address by encouraging women to run with their ideas and start
their own companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no better time to be an entrepreneur because the
Internet is providing huge opportunities to change how entire
industries work,'' said Jones, who last month led pcOrder through
its first sale of stock to the public that raised $46.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Jones inspired anyone to put in her two weeks notice
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Olivia Boone, a TI product specialist who transferred from
Dallas to Austin two years ago, doubts it.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, Boone says, high-tech employees tend to focus on
moving up within large corporations, whereas in Austin ``everyone,
both the men and the women, want to be the next Michael Dell.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is common ground. The power of mentoring is a
conference theme that resonates in both cities because senior-level
women remain the exception at large corporations and small
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Shaunna Sowell, one of Texas Instruments' top ranking female
executives, told the audience that if a brutally honest mentor
hadn't set her straight more than a decade ago, she would never
have gotten to where she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started out by talking about how much potential I had, and
of course I was too naive to see where it was going,'' Sowell, vice
president and manager of TI's worldwide facilities, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he told me I expressed my opinion so often and so vocally
that the minute I opened my mouth people stopped listening.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a mortifying moment, but it caused her to change her
approach.
</P>
<P>
   She encouraged women to start formal mentoring programs at their
companies. Two years ago, TI began matching women and minorities
with mid-level managers, most of whom are white men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides get a perspective they aren't usually exposed to,
and they talk about things they have never thought about,'' Sowell
said. This year's conference, which ends today, attracted 1,000
women, about the same number as last year's.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to rotate the Texas conference between Austin and
Dallas, said WITI's executive director Carolyn Leighton-Tal. But
whether the group will actually make it back to Central Texas is
still in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can find enough hotel space in Austin,'' she said, ``we
will be there absolutely.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executives of Glaxo Wellcome PLC, the pharmaceutical giant, said
they were delighted to learn earlier this month that an independent
study had found that one of their drugs was more effective for
people trying to quit smoking than the nicotine patch.
</P>
<P>
   The study crowned a remarkably successful second career for the
drug, sustained-release bupropion, which is sold for smoking
cessation as Zyban. The drug was introduced in 1997 as an
antidepressant, extended-release Wellbutrin.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, the virtually identical drug _ even the same
grape color  &UR;  &LR; _ was rolled out as Zyban. As Wellbutrin, the drug
had $506 million in sales in the United States last year, while as
Zyban, it had another $151 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The chance for such lucrative second and third uses is driving
nearly every big pharmaceutical company to try to expand a drug
brand. While the trend is not new, there has been a recent upsurge
in such activity as drug companies labor to maintain their strong
earnings growth in the face of rising costs for research and
development.
</P>
<P>
   New, approved uses for drugs _ what the industry calls
indications _ have also increased since the Food and Drug
Administration relaxed its policy last year on distributing
information about an existing drug's likely uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug companies are definitely searching for additional
indications more now than in the past,'' said Ian Sanderson, a
managing director at SG Cowen Securities. ``The Food and Drug
Administration is encouraging drug companies to conduct studies for
the development of new indications. But generating new indications
has become a way for the drug companies to rescue a flagging
franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monsanto Co. rolled out Celebrex, a pain killer for
arthritis, in January and immediately announced that the drug was
being tested to treat Alzheimer's disease and colon cancer. The
American Home Products Corp. has put Premarin, the world's leading
estrogen replacement therapy, back in the lab as a potential
treatment for Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Even the granddaddy of them all _ Prozac _ may find yet another
way to make the world's population happier. Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. &UR;  &LR; has
filed an application with the FDA to have the popular
antidepressant approved to treat severe premenstrual syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   All are trying to find ways to increase revenues with minimal
expense for research and development. By creating a second brand,
they can do both with very little risk.
</P>
<P>
   For one, pharmaceutical companies do not have to replicate the
research done before there can be clinical trials on people. That
can cut years and some $20 million to $40 million from the
development process. This reduced research and development budget
means that second brands can have profit margins of around 85
percent, on average, compared with 80 percent for original
compounds.
</P>
<P>
   While drug research is extremely complex, doctors say that many
compounds are capable of treating more than one illness. Once a
drug shows some effectiveness within one of the body's complex
networks _ the central nervous system, for example _ it is often
able to treat several illnesses common to that area of the body.
</P>
<P>
   That explains why so many drugs originally used to treat
depression have later been approved by the FDA to treat anxiety and
panic disorder. Doctors also note that compounds used in
accelerated doses can also have different effects on the body.
Ibuprofen is sold over-the-counter as Advil, a common painkiller.
But at greatly increased doses, the drug is one of the leading
prescription treatments for arthritic swelling.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies need FDA approval before such alternate uses can
be cited on a drug's label. But the agency no longer frowns heavily
upon pharmaceutical companies' promoting their medications for
other uses without formal FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies can now give doctors information that has
appeared in a peer-reviewed medical journal or text book about an
approved medication's additional uses, allowing manufacturers to
establish new markets for existing medications much more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The financial downsides are few. Since existing drugs have
already passed the FDA's scrutiny, they are less likely to fail
clinical trials for new uses. Should the drug fail those trials,
the drug company loses some $250 million, analysts estimate, a
healthy sum but quite a bit less than the $500 million required to
develop original compounds.
</P>
<P>
   And the financial losses from drug expansions should fall
sharply as scientists become more sophisticated in their research
techniques. Scientists now expect to find additional uses of drugs
under development, while in the past, it was largely a case of
being pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer &UR;  &LR; Inc. had originally developed sildenafil citrate, best
known as Viagra, in the early 1990s to treat angina. The treatment
ultimately failed, but Pfizer scientists were encouraged from the
clinical trials when several men reported an odd side effect:
erections.
</P>
<P>
   Sildenafil citrate was then developed successfully for male
erectile dysfunction, what turned out to be an enormous market.
Viagra racked up $788 million in worldwide sales last year after
being on the market for only nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, new indications for drugs were primarily based on
good side effects that were uncovered in the clinical trials,''
said Carrie S. Cox, senior vice president for global business
management for Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc. ``But now we understand so
much more about how a drug affects the body so much earlier in the
research process. We can more effectively maximize a product's
opportunity.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   American Home Products, for example, has conducted more than
3,000 scientific studies on Premarin, an estrogen replacement
tablet, which has been on the market for 56 years. Most of the
Premarin studies have involved women's health, which have produced
a bounty of possible new uses. One study revealed that Premarin
helps stop tooth loss in women, a symptom of osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premarin has been out for such a long time that we have a vast
knowledge about the drug,'' said Dr. Philip de Vane, vice president
of clinical affairs at Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a division of
American Home Products. ``With tooth loss, people have realized
that the jaw is like the spine or hips. Women can protect their
teeth as they protect other parts of their bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   In developing new uses for drugs, scientists have also become
more thorough. When Monsanto was developing Celebrex, the company's
executives searched reports on diseases for any hint of medical
effects drugs like Celebrex could produce. One study by the state
of Tennessee found that these drugs could greatly reduce the
incidence of colon cancer, while another by Johns Hopkins
University suggested these medications slowed the progressions of
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of studies show us what the trends are,'' said Dr.
Philip Needleman, the co-president of G.D. Searle, Monsanto's
pharmaceutical division. ``It provides us with the basis of doing a
clinical trial.''
</P>
<P>
   While expanding a drug's uses should increase its sales, the new
brand can deliver a few other dividends. When an existing drug
receives FDA approval for a new use, the pharmaceutical company
sometimes receives an extension on the patent _ which now lasts 20
years _ but only in narrow circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   By developing a new use for finasteride, Merck &AMP; Co.'s drug for
treating enlarged prostates, the company received another patent on
the compound. Finasteride was reintroduced in 1998, in a different
dosage, as Propecia, a pill for male pattern baldness. The patent
on the five-milligram formulation of finasteride for the prostate
brand, Proscar, expires in 2006, but the one-milligram formulation
for Propecia is protected until 2013.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the extension should enable Merck to protect its
entire finasteride franchise from generics, but that does not
always work. De Vane noted that even with an extension on the new
dosage, the patent on the original compound will still expire and
invite generic competition.
</P>
<P>
   Second brands can also cause other troubles. There is no
guarantee the new brands will be a success, and, on rare occasion,
can become more trouble than they are worth. Take Propecia, a pill
that many analysts believed would rack up as much as $300 million
in sales its first year. Sales last year totaled a modest $83
million worldwide, despite Merck spending some $91 million for
advertisements promoting the drug to consumers, according to
Competitive Media Reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, meager sales were far from Propecia's only problem. When
Propecia was introduced, Merck executives insisted the drug did not
share Proscar's research budget but instead ran up its own bill,
estimated by analysts at some $450 million. At Propecia's current
sales pace, it will take a little more than five years just to
recoup the research money, without even starting to recover its
advertising expenses.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Merck said the company was pleased with
Propecia's performance, noting that more than 400,000 men in the
United States were using it after it was on the market for only one
year.
</P>
<P>
   Second brands can also sometimes confuse or even irritate some
consumers. Glaxo Wellcome did not go out of its way to tell
consumers that Zyban was actually sustained-release Wellbutrin.
While the two drugs cost the same _ about $1.16 a pill wholesale _
some 77 percent of Wellbutrin's prescriptions are covered by
insurers, compared with only 47.6 percent for Zyban, according to
the industry consultant IMS Health.
</P>
<P>
   Propecia users have been even less fortunate. Merck sold
Propecia for three times the price, per milligram, than what it
charged for Proscar. Since one Proscar tablet equals five daily
doses of Propecia, many men began splitting the pills into five
parts to save money. Analysts believe Propecia's lofty price may
have contributed to the drug's sluggish start, given that men must
take it for three months to see results.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that drug companies sometimes increase the price of
a drug that is used for a second indication to cover additional
expenses. Not only will the drug company have to recoup its costs
for consumer ads, the company may have expanded its sales force to
reach a new market.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these setbacks, drug companies are determined to keep
introducing second brands. Some executives even regard these new
indications not as marketing tools, but as significant advances in
science. And some appear to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first began studying Wellbutrin, we had all these
reports from people saying the drug helped them quit smoking,''
said Andrew Johnston, who heads psychiatric clinical development at
Glaxo Wellcome. ``At first we had only anecdotal evidence that it
worked. But we managed to confirm all that. Now we have shown that
you can treat nicotine addiction without using nicotine.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: A RETURN TO INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ When I was young in India, for four years I reported
a story I wrote of as ``the great adventure'' and believed was one
of the most important of our century.
</P>
<P>
   During the decade after India became independent a half-century
ago, I relished that story: Almost alone among countries newly
freed from colonialism, India had chosen and kept democracy as its
governance. The others mostly went quickly under hard-boot
government _ communism, fascism, militarism, juntaism, whatever it
chose to be called.
</P>
<P>
   Each time I return, I know India's decision remains central and
hopeful for itself and the world. But America and its allies think
about India with a mixture of condescension and irritability at its
desire to be seen and heard _ when they think of it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Every Indian government has resented ``India Who?'' but somehow
managed to carry on. For precisely a year, for instance, India has
been writing some pages in its history that may shape the adventure
as none since Nehru died in 1964 and his Congress Party ousted
itself from power by arrogance and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The current ruling coalition, 14 parties headed by the
Hindu-centered Bharatiya Janata Party, will stay in power or lose
it depending on three things. One is the ability of Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee to wean his party from the wildly bigoted
Hindu-first hard-liners and toward a moderation they detest.
Another is his still-forming economic strategy. How far and fast
will he move India from its mixture of private enterprise and
strangulation by regulation toward economic openness inviting to
investment?
</P>
<P>
   But to move at all he will have to end the outbreak of
persecution of the small Christian minority. Churches have been
burned, worshippers beaten and murdered.
</P>
<P>
   The police dawdle. A government investigation commission has
publicly protested its lack of resources and power.
</P>
<P>
   This in a country where a man once considered an untouchable is
president, where almost every minority _ Muslims, Christians,
Sikhs, Jews, Buddhists _ have reached high office, where Mother
Teresa received a state funeral. It is a country where civil peace
depends on the constitutional guarantees of equality among India's
religions _ almost as many as the world's.
</P>
<P>
   Christians are only 2 percent of India's billion people. But
what one minority suffers, all others fear.
</P>
<P>
   The persecution is the work of Hindu nationalists supporting
Vajpayee. He will have to choose between issuing one more
denunciation of the persecution and taking action that will cost
him extremist backing that helped bring him to office.
</P>
<P>
   All these years, India's political and religious leaders and its
wealthy have failed the Indian people. For hundreds of millions,
the poverty still is an insult to their very humanity.
</P>
<P>
   India still has enough street-sleepers to populate a sizable
nation. Scores of thousands in its capital live in hovels built on
stilts so that perhaps during monsoons open sewers will not flood
inside with excrement.
</P>
<P>
   But through it all Indians consistently insisted on their own
fundamentalism _ the right to vote politicians into office, or out.
</P>
<P>
   The West sometimes remembers India, as when India wins its
attention by carrying out nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo, Bosnia, Somalia, bananas _ those are the big
``foreign'' concerns for Americans. Also: Can we succeed in
appeasing China, which is a perpetual threat to India? Can we make
China stronger with trade that costs us military secrets and a
yearly commercial imbalance of $50 billion?
</P>
<P>
   Europeans at least are consistent, historically regarding Asia
as a mango to be sliced up or squeezed into juice.
</P>
<P>
   Strange thing _ not a Western word is said about where the world
would be if Indians had chosen the Mao or Stalin way, or Saddam's.
We certainly would not be one bit condescending or irritable about
India.
</P>
<P>
   We would be too busy worrying about how to deal with a
totalitarian axis running through Asia, the Pacific, the Mideast
and Eastern Europe, headquartered in Beijing, Moscow and New Delhi
_ if we were allowed to deal at all.
</P>
<P>
   Indians chose the freedom of democracy for their sakes, not
ours. Still, it is nice to remember that choose it they did, and
still are.

 &HT;    Testimony heard in defense of Texas law charging property owners
liability for crimes
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Her voice was restrained, but Barbara Ayres, who
lost two daughters in Austin's infamous yogurt shop murders in
1991, urged a Senate committee Thursday not to weaken Texas law
that she said helped assure safer work for kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wanted this to happen in this business,'' Ayres told
the subcommittee on technology and business growth. ``No one
does.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said the yogurt shop where her daughters were killed,
with two other girls in a closing-time robbery, trained its
employees only in cleaning the equipment and not safety.
</P>
<P>
   The four teen-agers were shot in the head and burned when the
shop was set afire.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers testified against a tort-reform bill by state Sen. David
Sibley (R-Waco) that would allow juries to calculate in a civil
lawsuit against a business owner how much fault should be
attributed to a criminal. Such lawsuits allege that property owners
failed to protect employees or customers when a danger was
foreseeable.
</P>
<P>
   In the yogurt shop murders, the company that owned the I Can't
Believe It's Yogurt shop and the shopping center owner settled with
Ayres and families of the other girls for $12 million in 1994. The
families alleged lax security when crime had increased in the North
Austin neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the settlement proceeds established a foundation in the
girls' memory _ We Will Not Forget SAJE _ that helps educate
children about safety at work. SAJE refers the victims, Sarah
Harbison, 15; Amy Ayers, 13; Jennifer Harbison, 17; and Eliza
Thomas, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres is the mother of the Harbison girls.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley's bill, backed by the Texas Association of Business &AMP;
Chambers of Commerce, also would allow juries to calculate the
amount of fault for workplace injuries attributed to an employer in
lawsuits brought against product manufacturers or contractors.
Under current law, the employer is immune from such suits because
workplace injuries are covered by the state's worker compensation
program.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Sibley's law told the committee that juries
currently do not figure in any fault that might be the employer's.
The third party then pays the total of the jury's award, even
though the employer might have been responsible too, testified
Austin lawyer Alan Waldrop, who is representing the chambers of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But Hartley Hampton, president of the Texas Trial Lawyers
Association, said the bill could reduce an award to an injured
worker who might not recover as much from workers compensation
insurance _ even if the employer were grossly negligent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a fair share system,'' Hampton said.

 &HT;    Georgia Tech's engineering school rises in U.S. News estimation
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If only it were basketball. Georgia Tech made the
polls in a big way this week when U.S. News &AMP; World Report ranked
its engineering school third best in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   That is up from last year's fourth-place finish in the
magazine's annual rankings of graduate and professional schools.
The magazine, which hits the newsstands Monday, also ranked Tech's
computer science program 13th and its college of management 33rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased that the impressive work of our faculty is so
highly regarded at the national level,'' said Tech President Wayne
Clough. ``Graduate education is extremely important as we continue
the transition to a high-tech, information-based economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Tech, several other Georgia colleges made the list:
</P>
<P>
   _ Emory University's school of medicine moved from 21st to 19th
among research-oriented medical schools; the Goizueta Business
School's MBA program ranking remained unchanged at 21st; the School
of Law was ranked 28th this year, after being 25th last year, but
its trial advocacy program was ranked third.
</P>
<P>
   _ The University of Georgia's school of education ranked 18th,
with four of its programs ranking in the top 10, while its law
school ranked 36th, down from 34th. UGA's speech pathology program
ranked 41st.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia State University's part-time MBA program dropped from
fourth to sixth this year; its law school moved from the second
tier to the third tier. Mercer University's law school also dropped
from second tier to third tier.

 &HT;    UT board chairman re-elected
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Don Evans, recently named national finance
chairman of Gov. George W. Bush's presidential exploratory
committee, will continue to serve in another big volunteer job:
chairman of the UT System Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member board unanimously elected Evans to a second
two-year term at a special meeting Thursday. The board also
re-elected vice chairmen Tom Loeffler of San Antonio and Rita
Crocker Clements of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who is 52 and has two degrees from UT, is president and
chief executive officer of an oil and gas company, Tom Brown Inc.
Evans told the board he was ``not only humbled but also flattered
that the board has placed their confidence in me once again. ... I
look forward to the next two years _ to making higher education
more accessible, more affordable to all Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said later that he would not have sought a second term if
he did not think he had the time to devote to it. He and his family
are considering moving to Austin, but no decision has been made, he
said.

VIVIAN HALLINAN, SAN FRANCISCO POLITICAL ACTIVIST, DIES AT 88  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vivian Hallinan, the striking matriarch of one of San
Francisco's best-known and most colorful political families, died
on Tuesday at a granddaughter's home in Berkeley, Calif. She was
88.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hallinan, the widow of Vincent Hallinan, a fiery socialist
lawyer who died in 1995, made a multi-million-dollar fortune by
buying apartment buildings during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't trust the stock market, so she didn't get wiped
out, and had money to buy buildings real cheap,'' said Shane
Hallinan, the granddaughter at whose home Mrs. Hallinan died.
</P>
<P>
   Her profits financed her political causes, which included
leftist movements like the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. ``She was
aware of the contradiction,'' Shane Hallinan said. ``But she
believed she was able to do something to better the world with the
money she made.''
</P>
<P>
   A native San Franciscan, Mrs. Hallinan was born Oct. 21, 1910,
to Ed Moore and Katherine Lagomarsino Moore. After her parents'
brief marriage ended, she was reared by her mother, whose maiden
name she adopted, and by a series of immigrant Italian relatives.
She attended the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   After her marriage in 1932 to Hallinan Mrs. Hallinan reared six
sons. She wrote about the experience in ``My Wild Irish Rogues''
(Doubleday &AMP; Co., 1952).
</P>
<P>
   Politics was her passion as much as parenting, however. She
helped her husband with his campaign in 1952 as the presidential
candidate of the Progressive Party. She also held the family
together when he spent six months in jail in the 1950s for contempt
of court, in connection with his support of the labor organizer
Harry Bridges, who was accused of being a Communist Party member.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hallinan, elegant and chestnut-haired, served 30 days for
participating in the 1964 civil rights demonstrations in San
Francisco. She was also tear-gassed once, in Chile in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``She found the experience in jail heartening,'' Shane Hallinan
said. ``She was used to being judged by her movie-star looks or her
money, and here she was with just all these other women. The other
stuff didn't matter, and she liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   With her during that civil rights demonstration were all of her
sons, including Terence Hallinan, now the district attorney for San
Francisco. ``Everyone was there except my father, who stayed
outside with the bail money,'' said Patrick Hallinan of Kentfield,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Terence and Patrick, Mrs. Hallinan is survived by three
other sons: Matthew, Daniel and Conn, all of Berkeley, and 16
grandchildren.

HOUSE PASSES MISSILE BILL; TEST BOOSTS HOPES FOR DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When an Army missile slammed into a test target
earlier this week, intercepting a fake warhead in the skies over
New Mexico, officials cheered and said the significance could ``not
be overstated.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, where Congress was debating a system to
protect the continent from missile attack, the New Mexico test
underlined a growing reality: Successful missile interceptions are
rare. And the technology for a national missile-defense system
barely exists.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the House overwhelmingly passed a national
missile-defense bill, 317-105, responding to warnings that emerging
nations could soon be capable of launching an attack on the United
States. The Senate passed a similar measure, 97-3, the day before.
Differences in the bills must be reconciled by a House-Senate
conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills were broad and vague, declaring more of a
national-security mindset than a concrete strategy for deploying
the program, which has been in development for years. Its main
focus is on developing a heat-seeking missile that could detect a
foreign missile, chase it as it traveled outside the Earth's
atmosphere, then destroy it by ramming into it _ the ``hitting a
bullet with a bullet'' approach. As currently envisioned, the US
missiles would be based in North Dakota and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the joy of officials in New Mexico _ who admitted they
had not expected the test missile to work _ highlighted the
technological hurdles of getting such a precise mechanism to
succeed, even as it presented opponents political ammunition to
fight the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent very significant amounts of money getting to a
point that still leaves a long journey to travel,'' said Senator
John F. Kerry, a Democrat from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody disputes the fact we have all sorts of risks,'' said
Representative John F. Tierney, Democrat of Massachusetts. ``The
question is, when do you deploy? We have less than 13 percent
success ratio on unsophisticated tests. We're trying to get a
commitment to deploy before there's any technology.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the United States has spent more than $40 billion in
research and development and has conducted just 15 missile
interception tests outside the Earth's atmosphere. Of those, only
two succeeded, and they weren't conducted with the actual missiles
under consideration now. They also used ``cheating'' mechanisms,
such as pre-programmed computer coordinates indicating the location
of the target, military analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Further tests are expected to be conducted this year. But it
could be anywhere from 3 to 10 years before a complete umbrella
shield is in place over all 50 states, according to defense analyst
John Pike, who said the New Mexico test was an unremarkable
development considering the vast amounts of technology the Army
still lacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the temptation would be overwhelmingly to overstate
the significance of these things,'' said Pike of the Federation of
American Scientists. ``It's one thing to be able to occasionally
hit something. It's another thing to wager millions of American
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one argues the United States should ignore the
threat of missile attack from abroad, many Democrats also see
myriad problems with the plan on the foreign relations front. One
fear is that it could upset the delicate balance of international
nuclear power. Russia is a particular concern, especially as its
parliament debates whether to ratify an arms reduction treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But for political reasons, and in reaction to a looming
international threat, virtually no one protested the final bill.
Opposition has melted in the face of last year's weapons tests by
North Korea and Iran, and this month's disclosures that China may
have stolen nuclear technology from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who vetoed an earlier version of the bill in
1995, shifted in recent days to support the current measure.
Democrats ultimately threw their support behind the plan, as well,
depriving Republicans of the chance to use missile defense as a
political issue during the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   After the votes, Clinton issued a statement, saying, ``We are
committed to meeting the growing danger that outlaw nations will
develop and deploy long-range missiles that could deliver weapons
of mass destruction against us.''

COMMENTARY: THE REVERSE DOMINO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ I last visited Thailand 15 months ago as the
country's economy was in a tailspin, on its way into the history
books as the first domino of the 1997-98 global economic crisis.
After revisiting Thailand for a couple of days, all I can say is:
What a difference a year makes!
</P>
<P>
   Thailand is still not out of the woods financially, but the
situation has stabilized and the country is on a growth path again.
What is most striking, though, is the degree to which Thai
political reformers, who were hit hard by the economic crisis, now
view it as an enormously useful turning point for their country.
</P>
<P>
   There is a notion floating around out there that countries such
as Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia were all doing just fine
until the ugly, greedy forces of globalization disrupted them. This
is pure nonsense. They were all accidents waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Thais will freely tell you today that they had a corrupt,
crony-capitalist system with no transparency, a plethora of insider
dealings, a less than democratic regime and a public often living
beyond its means. And what the global economic crisis did was
expose the rot and force changes onto Thailand _ democratizing
changes _ that the traditional elite families and power brokers
were resisting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not see the IMF as the enemy,'' explained Kavi
Chongkittavron, executive editor of The Nation newspaper. ``We see
it as a baton forcing us to change our society in some very radical
ways, which never could have been done within the traditional Thai
framework, or at least could not have been done quickly. If you
look at the political changes over the past 18 months, what has
happened in Thailand is a miracle. In the 1860s Thailand was forced
open by the British, who wanted to colonize us, and that external
pressure was used to modernize Thailand. Today the external forces
of globalization are being used to push democratization.''
</P>
<P>
   Since September 1997 Thailand has passed the most democratic
constitution in the country's history _ including a freedom of
information act, which has set loose the press hounds on every
government department _ as well as 11 economic reform bills,
including last week's new laws for bankruptcy and corporate
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   So many of the Asian Tigers never had real bankruptcy laws
because everyone was just growing. They were like towns with only
maternity wards and no funeral homes. But corporate funeral homes
are critical to clean up a rotten economy, and now Thailand has
them, as well as a whole new set of laws banning insider dealings
and vote-buying by officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic problem here was political in nature,'' said
Kavi, ``and it could not be solved without changing these bad
politicians. Without this external pressure we could never have
broken the hold of 50 families over the Thai economy, we could
never have reformed the banking system so quickly. We
underestimated globalization, we thought we were at the top of the
world because we had escaped colonization. We had resisted the
British, so who needs to worry about globalization? We were wrong,
and now we are catching up.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes are messy and still accompanied by lots of political
wrangling, but in the end they are being ``built on a real
political consensus,'' says a Thai investment banker, Teera
Phutrakul.
</P>
<P>
   Still, elements of the traditional bureaucracy and powerful
families are fighting a rear-guard action that will gain momentum
if the economy does not start growing faster. Growth in 1998 was
negative 8 percent, but is expected to bounce back to a positive 1
percent in 1999. There is relatively little unemployment, because
many people fell back on their villages or family networks and are
sharing jobs to get by. But there has been a sharp drop in incomes.
</P>
<P>
   If robust growth does emerge, though, the Thai example could be
hugely influential in Asia. It would declare that the country that
reformed its economic and political system the furthest and deepest
enjoys the most stable recovery and attracts the most foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet the autocrats in China, Vietnam, Burma, Malaysia and
Indonesia will all be watching. ``If we can succeed economically,
we can be like a reverse domino in the political sphere,'' said
Kavi. ``The lesson will be that Thailand survived the crisis the
best because it adopted the best democratic reforms. If that
happens, and I am Burma, I would be worried. If I am Malaysia, I
would be worried. If I am Vietnam, I would be worried. If I am
China, I would be worried.'' (BOX)

DIVORCE DIPLOMACY  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21)
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: (AT) in the e-mail address in the last graf should be
replaced with the typographical symbol.) 
(af) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm getting a divorce. I hope it will be amicable, but you
never know. In any case, it will take a lot of time to arrange for
our children, establish separate households, confer with lawyers
and attend to all the details. What should I tell my bosses and
colleagues? And how, more generally, do I keep a personal disaster
from becoming a professional one as well? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: The consensus of several experts: Keep it to yourself, at
least initially.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, you want to avoid having your private life become
grist for the office gossip mill, said Virginia Byrd, a career
counselor based in the San Diego area. ``There's no need for you to
lay that all out and have people have opinions about it,'' Ms. Byrd
said. ``It just makes it more difficult for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Telling all runs another risk: Supervisors may assume that your
job performance is suffering. ``The boss then begins to watch you
with suspicion, and people sometimes read mistakes into things that
would not otherwise be viewed as mistakes,'' warned Martha A.
Fineman, a law professor at Columbia University who has been a
consultant in several high-profile divorce cases, including that of
Gary C. Wendt, the former chief executive of GE Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Women face this perception problem more often than men, Ms.
Fineman said, ``because women are always fighting against the more
generalized notion that they are more emotional or more crushed by
family concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your sex, there is sometimes no way to keep your
personal life separate from your work life. Many companies try to
maintain such walls, however, so as soon as the divorce starts
affecting your behavior, you need to tell the boss that something
is up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case I was acting strange or was not in the office, I
wouldn't want the boss to assume that I was looking for another job
or just going crazy,'' said Leonard Florescue, a partner at Tenzer
Greenblatt, a law firm in Manhattan. The need for disclosure may
depend largely ``on how much you can compartmentalize your life, a
la President Clinton,'' Florescue said. If you're snapping at your
staff or otherwise acting strangely, he added, ``you probably owe
it to people to tell them.''
</P>
<P>
   But maintain discretion, even at this stage. ``Don't tell
everything,'' Ms. Byrd advised, ``but say that you're working
through a personal problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Find people outside the office to help you cope with the
inevitable distress. ``You are going to have to share your
emotional trauma with somebody,'' Ms. Fineman said. ``But talk
about it with friends and professional counselors, and really try
as much as possible to separate it from the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   As for telling your colleagues, Ms. Byrd said there was nothing
wrong with waiting until you've worked through some of the rough
spots. After all, you have enough to worry about without co-workers
whispering around the water cooler or asking, ``Are you sure you're
all right?'' 30 times a day. &QL;

U.S. TRADE DEFICIT REACHES NEW MONTHLY HIGH
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As U.S. exports continued to fall, the U.S. trade
deficit jumped to a new monthly record of nearly $17 billion in
January, fueled by a flood of imports from China that could stir
further protectionist sentiments in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Among the imports flowing into the United States, Chinese-made
steel surged 65 percent from December. On Wednesday, the House of
Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill that would sharply
limit steel imports, a movement that may gain momentum now that
China is joining Japan, Brazil and Russia on the list of nations
pouring inexpensive steel into the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were released Thursday just as China and the United
States enter a critical phase in negotiations over China's push to
enter the World Trade Organization. Intense talks are underway in
Geneva over the terms of China's entry, in hopes of reaching an
agreement before the Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji visits
Washington in early April. The deadline has breathed life into
talks that have sputtered for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. negotiator said this week that ``we've made more
progress with the Chinese in the last three weeks than in the last
three years,'' and this morning President Clinton's top economic
advisers met at the White House to try to assess China's
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   But they emerged uncertain, both about the prospects of getting
China to dismantle huge trade barriers, and the prospects of
getting any deal though Capital Hill, where it would become
instantly wrapped up in the politics of nuclear espionage, human
rights violations and growing anti-China sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altogether, we have a mounting series of problems that are
going to be difficult to manage, to say the least,'' Commerce
Secretary William Daley said in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring monthly trade deficit _ after a record $170 billion
deficit for all of 1998 _ considerably exceeded analysts'
expectations of $14.9 billion. The $16.99 billion deficit in goods
and services was the highest since monthly statistics began being
reported in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit in manufactured goods rose to a record $23.42
billion in January, up from $20.5 billion in December. The United
States, however, ran a $6.4 billion surplus in services, from
consulting to insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But the deficit also reflected the continued strength of the
U.S. economy, which has created an enormous demand for imported
consumer goods. The sharp increase occurred even though there was
no rise in the value of imported gasoline and other petroleum
products, now selling at prices lower than at any point in the past
quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most worrisome part of the report was not the rise
in imports, but the falloff in exports. They decreased to $76.8
billion, down from $79.5 billion in the month a year earlier.
Imports of goods and services rose to $93.8 billion, compared with
$89.6 billion in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So far the decline in exports has had little effect on the
unemployment rate or in the growth of the economy, which expanded 6
percent in the fourth quarter of last year. Except in hard-hit
steel towns, the booming domestic consumer demand has made up for
the falloff in exports. But the numbers suggest that the United
States will not have export markets to fall back on if the domestic
economy cools this year.
</P>
<P>
   The export figures are particularly troublesome for the White
House, where officials who once proclaimed that America's surging
exports were creating jobs and fueling the economy are now arguing
that rising imports can be healthy, too. On Thursday officials
cautioned about reading too much into the bleak January numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry much about the monthly numbers of any kind,''
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said. ``We are the only major
economy that is growing at a robust rate.'' At the same time, Rubin
and other administration officials have begun explicitly warning
Europe that the United States cannot be expected to continue to
absorb such a huge share of the goods the rest of the world
produces.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the United States remains the world's only real
engine of growth _ meaning that the trade deficit will likely swell
further this year. Despite hints that a modest revival may be in
the offing, Japan remains in deep recession, and U.S. exports to
Japan fell 10 percent compared with those in January 1998. Perhaps
more politically important, exports to China were down to $779
million for the month from $1.35 billion in December, a tiny figure
compared with imports of $5.56 billion. Put another way, the ratio
of U.S. imports to exports with China is 1-to-7. With Japan it is
roughly 1-to-2, suggesting that the problems of access to the
Chinese market are far worse.
</P>
<P>
   The administration argues that a deal to get China into the
World Trade Organization would solve some of those problems over
the long run. It would force China to sharply reduce its protective
tariffs, and it would include access to the Chinese market for U.S.
food producers, banks, insurance firms, and other businesses. U.S.
computer makers are pushing hard for a deal, and wrote to Congress
this week urging a relaxing of export restrictions of U.S.
technology there _ something that stands very little chance given
the politics between China and the United States this week.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of allegations about spying at U.S. weapons
laboratories and the rising deficit with China combine into a sense
that China is intent on playing outside the rules _ and many
members of Congress think that WTO membership would be a reward to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   That belief could hinder any chances for a deal, a senior
Chinese diplomat, He Yafei, said at a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the political atmosphere will have a bearing on any
negotiation between our two countries,'' he said. ``Especially when
some members or senators are saying, `even if you have a deal, even
if that deal is good for the U.S. business community, we will not
give China permanent normal trade relations.'''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded, ``That is absurd.''

<P>
   What do Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Cosby, Liam Neeson, Christie
Brinkley, Boris Becker and Tommy Hilfiger have in common?
Obviously, they all have incomes that make it unnecessary to do
much heavy lifting. But they also belong to an exclusive, well,
cult: the cult of the Gelaendewagen.
</P>
<P>
   Allow me to explain. Just over 20 years ago, Steyr-Daimler-Puch,
an Austrian contractor for Daimler-Benz, developed a heavy,
Jeep-like military vehicle for the shah of Iran. After he was
overthrown, Mercedes sold this Gelaendewagen _ ``cross country
vehicle'' in German _ to various European armies and then, spruced
up, to a few civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Because its military specifications made it so expensive,
Mercedes opted not to bring it to North America. But in 1983, David
Holland, the founder of Europa International, a dealer of vintage
Mercedes cars in Santa Fe, N.M., got the idea of importing G-Wagens
for their curiosity value.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 to '98, Europa sold a few dozen lushly-equipped three-
and five-door versions (labeled the G320 for their 3.2-liter six
cylinder engines). Now Europa is importing a swankier version from
the Austrian factory, a model that preserves the G-Wagen's squarely
retro look but uses a new Mercedes engine that meets environmental
requirements in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   The price: $135,000 for the five-door wagon and convertible,
$5,000 less for the three-door model. Luxury taxes run another
$6,000.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you _ or, more to the point, what will a handful of
screen and boardroom stars _ get for the money? The G500 is a very
tall midsize sport utility with full-time four-wheel-drive and all
the luxury features you'd expect: stiff but comfortable heated
leather seats, walnut trim, five-speed electronic automatic
transmission, halogen headlamps, power sunroof, theft-protection
system.
</P>
<P>
   Plus a few you wouldn't: a gizmo that warns of obstacles when
you're backing up; a supercool lighted Mercedes logo inside the
front-door frame. Options include running boards, grille guard,
voice-activated phone and a powerful winch recessed in the bumper.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-liter, 300-horsepower aluminum V8 is a potent variation on
the engines that Mercedes stuffs into several E- and M-Class
models. The anti-skid vented disc brakes behind the 18-inch alloy
wheels stop the G-Wagen forcefully despite its 5,260-pound curb
weight.
</P>
<P>
   In ordinary driving, the G-Wagen is a mix of naughty and nice.
The view from captain's chairs high above the road couldn't be
better. And thanks to the monster V8, acceleration is literally a
kick. But the ride is not as comfortable as that of most high-end
sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The rigid rear axle makes the G-Wagen less than sure-footed on
choppy pavement, and the weight of all that military steel makes it
an unwilling partner on sharp turns.
</P>
<P>
   The soul of the G500 is more apparent in difficult off-roading,
where Pathfinders and Troopers fear to tread. Lockable center, rear
and front differentials allow the G-Wagen to gain traction through
any combination of wheels. The center of gravity is fairly low
despite the high clearance, giving the G-Wagen superior stability
on inclines as steep as 45 degrees. And even an amateur off-roader
like me felt safe and secure on a jaunt along a dry creek bed full
of boulders.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest selling point, though, is bound to be the G500's
exclusivity. Roughly 100 of the 2,000 or so made this year will end
up in the United States, making them much rarer than another
celebrity vehicle with a military pedigree: the far flashier
Hummer.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, Mercedes-Benz wowed the world with its M-Class,
an ``all activity vehicle'' that set performance and versatility
standards in the sport utility market, yet was priced to compete
with models derived from aging truck designs.
</P>
<P>
   So what could be better than the 3.2-liter, 6-cylinder,
215-horsepower all-wheel drive ML320? Well, DaimlerChrysler is back
with the 4.3-liter, 8-cylinder, 268-horsepower ML430, a slightly
more muscular-looking variation on the same bankable theme.
</P>
<P>
   Improved on-road performance and tougher-guy styling comes at a
price, though: $43,750 to be specific, or about $5,000 more than a
comparably equipped ML320.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the ML430 so easy to like? Count the ways. Bold curves
and lots of glass make it better looking than boxy,
earlier-generation sport utilities (though nearly everyone says it
looks like a minivan from the rear). Integrated body-color trim and
17-inch wheels give it a more macho look than the ML320.
</P>
<P>
   Every version of the M-Class has a spacious _ airy, even _
interior, offering as much shoulder and leg room as a Mitsubishi
Montero in a package six inches shorter. The seats are what you'd
expect from Mercedes: firm, but comfy in an ergonomically correct
way. And while the ML430 looks tall, the step-in height is a modest
18 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Early copies of the M-Class, built at a new Mercedes factory in
Alabama, generated complaints about fit and finish. But the car I
tested was rattle-free. The plastic trim meshed beautifully with
the standard leather seating; the cup holders opened as if their
surfaces were coated with Teflon.
</P>
<P>
   The ML430 maintains Mercedes' tradition of one-step-ahead
engineering. Unlike most sport utilities, the M-Class features an
independent rear suspension for superior ride and handling, as well
as a drivetrain that can deliver power to all four wheels, all of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-lock brakes are standard, and Mercedes complements the
brake sensors that detect wheel slippage with sensors that measure
lateral forces. When the computer's ``electronic stability
program'' determines that the tires are about to give way on the
front or rear _ in a condition of ``understeer'' or ``oversteer'' _
it applies the brakes to a single wheel to maintain control.
</P>
<P>
   All this worked perfectly fine in wet but temperate conditions
in Southern California, but the system is apparently not
infallible. A writer for USA Today reported that the computerized
sensors ran amok on icy roads in a Midwest blizzard, intermittently
applying the brakes and cutting the power just when it was needed
most.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes engineers have worked almost as hard to placate
environmentalists as it has to satisfy safety mavens. The new V8 in
the ML430 has dual sparkplugs that make for cleaner burning, along
with a three-valve-per-cylinder design that speeds the warming of
the catalytic converter. This combination sharply reduces emissions
in the critical minutes after the engine starts, qualifying the
ML430 as a low-emission vehicle nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Tree-huggers (including me) will also appreciate the fact that
the new V8 uses electronics to minimize the need for oil changes. A
sensor measures oil quality, warning drivers when the lubricant is
dirty, rather than simply reminding them to service the engine
after a fixed number of miles or revolutions. The result: a lower
volume of contaminants to threaten groundwater and fewer trips to
the dealer's service department.
</P>
<P>
   None of this technical razzle-dazzle is on display in ordinary
driving. What is apparent is that the ML430 is an exceptionally
potent people mover. The V8 pushes this 4,550-pound vehicle from 0
to 60 miles an hour in 8 seconds flat _ a full second faster than
the V6 in the ML320. And it feels even quicker, perhaps because
maximum torque is achieved at a relatively low engine speed of
3,000 revolutions per minute.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed electronically controlled transmission shifts
virtually seamlessly, and it automatically adjusts shift points to
each driver's habits. The very sophisticated suspension makes for
carlike stability on twisting roads.
</P>
<P>
   I never pushed the ML430 anywhere near its limits, but it should
be able to stay in the game with proven off-roaders. Low range
five-speed gearing, available at the push of a button, permits
steep ascents; clearances are adequate for moderately bad terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints? The stiff suspension generates a fatiguing,
un-car-like jiggle even on smooth pavement. One might be tempted to
chalk this up to the engineering compromises necessary to create a
vehicle that is as competent off the road as on it.
</P>
<P>
   But truth is, the ML430 is a less comfortable ride than the
Toyota Land Cruiser, which is also admired for its versatility.
</P>
<P>
   The more significant question is value. The ML430 combines car
and sport utility features in a well-engineered package. But so,
too, does the ML320, which offers comparable safety and comfort _
and most of the performance _ for a lot less money.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, other manufacturers are beginning to offer
very competitive products in the luxury end of the mid-size SUV
market. The Lexus RX300 won't get you very far on mud or sand, but
is quieter and more comfortable than the M-Class on the highway.
And the BMW X5, due later this year, is bound to be a formidable
rival for the loyalty of the big-bucks crowd.  &QL;

   He said Oscar season is ``a terrible time for this town. It's a

DEATHS FROM MAD COW DISEASE INCREASED LAST YEAR, BRITISH REPORT
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of people who have died in Britain from a human form
of mad cow disease increased at an ``alarming rate'' at the end of
last year, according to a scientific report being published in
Saturday's issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of 1996 through September 1998, the number of
deaths reported each quarter year stayed relatively constant, said
Dr. Simon Cousens, a scientist who is helping track the disease at
the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Usually no more
than four people died in any three month period, he said. But in
the last quarter of 1998, nine deaths were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Given the steady death rate in previous years, the probability
of observing nine deaths in three months is low, Cousens said. But
he said it was hard to gauge the public health significance of the
new statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths ``are bad news rather than good news but how bad news
they are is difficult to tell,'' he told the BBC in an interview
Thursday. ``We are going to have to wait another six or nine months
to see'' if the increase continues.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995 when the human form of mad cow disease was first
recognized in humans, 39 Britons have died from the disease. Three
cases were confirmed in 1995, 10 in both 1996 and 1997 and 15 in
1998. There has been one confirmed case this year. But Cousens
added that it is possible that doctors have simply gotten better at
diagnosing the disease which in humans is called new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or variant CJD. The increase could also
be a statistical fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, scientists from Britain's National CJD
Surveillance Unit projected as few as 75 and as many as 80,000
deaths from nvCJD, depending on the length of the incubation period
and how the infection is passed from animals to humans. Neither has
been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic began in 1986 when a bizarre brain disease called
spongiform encephalopathy began killing cattle in the U.K. Infected
animals developed spongy areas in their brains, suffered
personality changes and began staggering in circles _ hence the
term mad cow disease. By the beginning of this year, 173,718 cows
had been positively diagnosed with the disease while more than 4
million animals have been destroyed in an effort to stamp out the
infection. Cows appear to have gotten ill from eating the rendered
remains of infected animals.
</P>
<P>
   At first government officials assured the public that people
could not get the brain disease from eating infected cattle. But
when young people began to develop CJD _ a disease almost
exclusively found in people over age 50 _ scientists began to
worry. Two years ago researchers showed that the brains of infected
cows and the brains of young people dying from CJD have identical
characteristics. The human form of mad cow disease was then named
new variant CJD.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last year, Dr. John Collinge, a leading CJD expert at Imperial
College in London, discovered that the tonsils of variant CJD
victims carry an infectious particle, called a prion, that seems to
be responsible for the disease. The infectious prions are found
throughout nervous and lymphatic tissue, including tonsils, and may
incubate for many years before causing overt signs of disease. Thus
medical facilities throughout Britain are now testing tissue
samples saved from thousands of tonsilectomies that took place in
the last decade to see how many, if any, carry infectious prions.
It is another method to gauge the spread of mad cow disease in
humans.

157 CHRISTIAN HOMES BURNED IN NEW RELIGIOUS CLASH IN INDIA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BHUBANESWAR, India _ Less than two months after a Hindu mob
killed a Christian missionary from Australia and his two young sons
here in the eastern state of Orissa, Hindus and Christians clashed
in a village this week, and 157 of the 250 Christian homes were
burned down, state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they presumed that Hindus set the fires on
Tuesday, but do not have solid evidence of who is guilty. Christian
villagers interviewed by television reporters blamed Hindus, who
they said shouted ``Victory to Lord Ram,'' a Hindu god, as they set
the fires. Thirteen people were wounded, three by gunfire, and the
police have arrested 29 people, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said tensions in the village _ Ranaloi, in southern
Orissa _ developed between Christians and Hindus after someone
painted a trident, symbol of the Hindu god Shiva, over a Christian
cross on a boulder about a mile outside the village.
</P>
<P>
   The violence is part of a growing number of attacks on
Christians in India in the last year. Church officials and
opposition political parties say the problem has worsened since the
Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party became the head of a
national coalition government a year ago. Party leaders say they
oppose the violence.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear who is responsible for the violence in Orissa,
which is governed by the Congress Party. The state's chief
minister, J.B. Patnaik, resigned after the killing of the
missionary, Graham Staines, and his sons, Timothy, 10, and Philip,
6, saying he took responsibility for the crime because it happened
on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   D.P. Wadhwa, the Indian Supreme Court justice who was named by
the government to head an inquiry into the Staines killings,
harshly criticized the central government for failing to provide
resources to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The commission of inquiry, which was set up six weeks ago, is
due to issue its finding in two weeks but has yet to field a team
of independent investigators or to be given functional offices to
work from.
</P>
<P>
   ``His lordship has serious concerns over the lapses of the
government and its apathetic attitude towards the urgent
requirements of the commission,'' D.G.R. Patnaik, secretary to the
commission, said. ``He has given them an ultimatum of one week to
deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   A.N. Sharma, a spokesman for the Home Ministry in New Delhi,
declined to comment on the judge's demand for staff and offices.
</P>
<P>
   The state police blamed a mob that they said was led by a man
from the Bajrang Dal, a Hindu nationalist youth group that belongs
to the same family of Hindu nationalist organizations as the
Bharatiya Janata Party.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Bajrang Dal denied involvement, and said the
violence was a backlash against what they called the Christians'
deceitful efforts to convert impoverished, illiterate Indians.
</P>
<P>
   L.K. Advani, home minister of the national government and a
leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, said within days of the
killings that the Bajrang Dal had not committed the crime. Leaders
of the opposition said that exoneration was grossly premature.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 people were arrested in connection with the
killings, but all but a half dozen have been released for lack of
evidence, Patnaik said. The police have refused to discuss their
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Indian government officials said there have been 238 registered
attacks on Christians in the last 20 years, 60 of them in Orissa.
The number of attacks on Christians in India rose to 86 last year
from seven the year before.

ANOTHER METEORITE MAY SHOW LIFE ON MARS, SCIENTISTS REPORT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England, Egypt)   By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The same scientists who caused a sensation by claiming that a
meteorite from Mars appeared to contain fossil and chemical traces
of microbial life announced Thursday that they had found another
meteorite with similar intriguing characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to a conference at the Lunar and Planetary Institute
in Houston, a team of geochemists led by Dr. David S. McKay of the
Johnson Space Center said the recently analyzed meteorite
``contains variable concentrations of tiny round to ovoid objects
which can plausibly be interpreted as bacterial cells in various
states of mineralization.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire report was couched in similarly cautious language.
The researchers noted that the size, shape and distribution of tiny
minerals in the meteorite are ``reminiscent of dividing bacteria,''
and that the texture ``closely resembles some mineralized bacterial
cells grown in Columbia River basalt microcosms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not claiming we have found direct evidence of Martian
life in this meteorite,'' McKay said in a telephone interview. But
some of the minerals, he added, strongly suggest biological origins
and should be examined in even more detail by other scientific
teams with more powerful analytical technology.
</P>
<P>
   Other planetary geologists and specialists in meteorite studies,
many of whom remain unconvinced by similar findings by McKay's team
three years ago, said they were skeptical of the biological
interpretation being applied to the new research.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, McKay, Dr. Everett K. Gibson Jr. and other
government and university scientists said that they had identified
organic compounds and certain minerals that they concluded ``are
evidence for primitive life on early Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence consisted of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
which often have biological origins, and two minerals, magnetite
and iron sulfide, both of which are related to bacterial action on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The material was found in fragments of a meteorite picked up in
Antarctica in 1984. It is designated Allan Hills 84001, and
scientists are almost certain it fell to Earth from Mars about
13,000 years ago. The discovery gave new impetus to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's revived program of Mars
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Critics maintain that the supposed evidence of biological
processes could have nonbiological explanations. But McKay said
Thursday that his team had recently made some converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe our magnetite findings in the Allan Hills meteorite
are getting stronger and stronger,'' he said. ``We think these
particular elongated prisms are biogenic, and we're sticking to
that story. The only examples we find on Earth are all biogenic.''
</P>
<P>
   In their new research, the geochemists analyzed chips from an
orange-size meteorite that landed in Egypt in 1911 and was almost
immediately collected by scientists. The particular fragment of
this meteorite came from the British Museum in London and
presumably had been protected from most terrestrial contamination
by a glassy crust that formed during the meteorite's fiery plunge
through the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In acknowledging some possible contamination, the research team
wrote: ``We suggest that this meteorite may contain two generations
of bacteria, an original Martian generation and a generation which
grew on Earth. The close proximity of the two generations might be
explained if the organic Martian remains served as favorable
attachment sites for the terrestrial bacteria.''

PARENTS OF DISABLED SUE FOR MEDICAID SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They are the aging parents of mentally retarded
children who have cared for those children all their lives. And
they are increasingly worried about their children's futures once
they become too frail to assist them, or they've passed on.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, parents and other advocates of the developmentally
disabled will file a class-action lawsuit in US District Court in
Boston seeking to force the state to provide Medicaid services to
nearly 3,000 mentally retarded adults. The 3,000 have all been
deemed eligible for Medicaid services, usually for residential
programs. But they have been on a waiting list, some for as long as
two decades, for lack of state funding.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Tummino, assistant DMR commissioner for field
operations, says the state has been making considerable progress in
recent years tackling the waiting list, and has been ranked fourth
nationally in those efforts by the National Association of
Developmental Disability Directors.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Sarkissian, executive director of the Association of
Retarded Citizens of Massachusetts, charges that people on the
waiting list receive the services they need only when they fall
into dire circumstances -- when they are being abused, or their
caretakers die or become ill.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three-year-old Christina Anderson says she is no longer
willing to wait.
</P>
<P>
   She has tended to all of her daughter Valerie's needs for her
entire life. Her 41-year-old daughter, who is mentally retarded,
deaf, mute and legally blind, is so dependent on her tht she
refuses to eat or sleep when she's not home.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson frets about what will happen if she falls seriously ill
or dies: Valerie, ``would just perish, literally. Because there is
no way to tell her I'm not here anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson wants to see daughter move into a residential program
soon, while she is still able to help others learn to communicate
with her daughter and to help her daughter adjust to a new way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   But her daughter already has languished for more than a decade
on the state Department of Mental Retardation waiting list for
services, without being given a hint of how much longer she must
wait.
</P>
<P>
   Neil McKittrick, an attorney at Hill &AMP; Barlow who is
representing the plaintiffs pro bono, said, ``The federal Medicaid
Act says that people are entitled to receive services with
`reasonable promptness.' And we say years is not reasonably
prompt.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents, McKittrick added, ``have done this for 45 years and
they've saved the Commonwealth millions of dollars. Now they need
some help.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some precedent for the lawsuit. Last year, a federal
judge ordered Florida to begin providing services to thousands of
developmentally disabled people within 30 days or risk having its
Medicaid funds frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Tummino said the waiting list in Massachusetts had been growing
at a rate of 13 percent a year since 1991, as more young people who
had been receiving special education entitlements turned 22 _ the
age when those entitlements end _ and signed up for Medicaid mental
retardation services instead.
</P>
<P>
   This year for the first time, Tummino noted, the state has
allocated funds to provide services to all those who age out of
special education, effectively stopping the waiting list from
growing further.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, under a three-year plan, the Cellucci
administration has earmarked a total of $15 million a year to pare
down the waiting list from a high of 3,400 in 1997 to a target of
2,700 by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Tummino said, the administration is working on $50
million a year plan to eliminate the remainder of the wait list
over six years.
</P>
<P>
   But Sarkissian believes the state is moving too slowly given the
Florida ruling and the large budget surpluses available.
</P>
<P>
   Sarkissian estimates that to provide services to everyone the
wait list immediately, the state needs to allocate $118 million a
year, 40 percent of which would be covered by federal
reimbursements.

 &HT;    Emory University archives are painting a fuller picture of
British poet laureate Ted Hughes, long cast as a villain over the
suicide of his wife, revered poet Sylvia Plath
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Though Ted Hughes, Britain's poet laureate, has been
dead five months, interest in his work has never been livelier.
</P>
<P>
   His last book of verse, ``Birthday Letters,'' just won the
prestigious Whitbread Prize; scholarship on his work is brisk; and
he seems, at last, to be emerging from the shadow of his first
wife, the late Sylvia Plath.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the Hughes archive at Atlanta's Emory University
is helping to spark this re-evaluation of the British poet.
Acquired two years ago for an undisclosed sum, the 2.5-ton
collection of manuscripts, letters, journals and unpublished works
is finally being made available to scholars. (The archive is not
open to the public.) Their early verdict: Hughes is a different man
and a different poet than we knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letters were all of a piece with the poems,'' said
Carolyne Wright, a visiting poet at the University of Miami who has
seen the archive. ``It's a consistent voice, the voice of a man who
is deeply, deeply marked by this violent death of this women he
loved so much.''
</P>
<P>
   That image is at odds with the Hughes of conventional wisdom:
the unfaithful husband blamed for Plath's suicide in 1963, the
controlling literary executor who burned one of her journals and
limited access to her work.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is Hughes who saw most of his late wife's work
into print. He edited her autobiographical novel, ``The Bell Jar,''
and the collection of poems, ``Ariel,'' that won Plath a Pulitzer
Prize almost 20 years after her death. But Hughes was scorned by
Plath's sympathizers, who shouted down his poetry readings and
chiseled his name off his dead wife's gravestone. While Plath's
legacy bloomed, Hughes' reputation, at least in America, remained
sullied.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Hughes refused to explain himself or to be
interviewed about Plath. When he died in October at age 68 of
prostate cancer, most obituaries gave as much print to her as to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Birthday Letters,'' was, in a way, the interview that Hughes
never gave, a bleak, intimate and honest account of his marriage to
the American poet and his despair after her death. Though he
married twice after Plath (his second wife, Assia Wevill, also
committed suicide, after killing their 2-year-old daughter; he was
married to Carol Hughes at the time of his death), the poems reveal
a broken man, looking back from the end of his life over a
relationship that would haunt him always.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Visit'' he writes: ``I look up _ as if to meet your voice /
With all its urgent future / that has burst in on me. Then look
back / At the book of the printed words. / You are ten years dead.
It is only a story. / Your story. My story.''
</P>
<P>
   The London Times was quick to offer Hughes in a new light:
``Anyone who thought Hughes's reticence was proof of his hard heart
will immediately see how stony they have been themselves,'' wrote
Times reviewer Andrew Motion.
</P>
<P>
   That openness is reflected in the wealth of personal material
that Hughes gave (for a price) to Emory. Stephen Enniss, Emory's
curator of literary collections, says the archive lays the poet's
life bare. ``For all the contentiousness of that literary history,
for all of that, Ted has made himself readily available, largely
without restriction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be vividly more accessible as a poet, because of
the letters he wrote about his practices and his goals,'' adds
Diane Middlebrook, a professor of English at Stanford University
who is studying the archive for a book about Hughes. ``Now he will
be written about with a fuller attention to his own explanation of
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory acquired the collection at least partly because the
school, enriched with a $1 billion gift from the Robert W. Woodruff
Foundation, could offer a good price. Even among Emory's rapidly
growing literary collections, which include manuscripts by William
Butler Yeats and Seamus Heaney, the Hughes collection is
significant. ``It dwarfs the others in terms of research
interest,'' said Enniss.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Bate, professor of literature at the University of
Liverpool, said, ``It's an amazingly full collection, which will
keep critics and future biographers occupied for years.''
</P>
<P>
   And Emory continues to add to it. Just this month, the
university received the only copy of what is thought to be Hughes'
earliest known poem, an ode to summer, written when he was at
Mexborough Grammar School in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' letters include many to his best college friend, Lucas
Myers, such as one from 1956 urging Myers to bring a young American
named Sylvia Plath to London so he could meet her. (``Get her
somehow,'' Hughes writes.) In 1984, nearly a lifetime later, he
writes to Myers of the creative paralysis caused by the tragedies
of Plath's and Wevill's suicides. Hughes was, he wrote,
anesthetized by grief, adding, ``(m)aybe life isn't long enough to
wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, England will offer its fallen poet laureate one final
honor: A stone honoring Hughes will be placed in Westminster Abbey.
There he will join the company of William Wordsworth, John Keats
and Alfred Lord Tennyson, a group that may forgive his earthly
shortcomings in light of his lasting verse.

MARKET PLACE: WHY DAIMLERCHRYSLER WALKED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ DaimlerChrysler AG has been painting a grim picture of
Nissan Motor Co.'s balance sheet _ or rather, what is absent from
it.
</P>
<P>
   Since DaimlerChrysler stopped talking with Nissan last week
about purchasing a stake in the heavily indebted Japanese
automaker, Renault of France has stepped forward with an offer. But
investors seem more interested in why DaimlerChrysler walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, it has been saying that it decided against taking a
stake in Nissan in the interest of concentrating on the smooth
integration of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corp., which combined
their businesses only in November.
</P>
<P>
   In private, however, DaimlerChrysler has been telling fund
managers and analysts in Europe and the United States that even
though it had 30 people examining Nissan's financial statements and
operations for six months, it cannot say for certain that it firmly
grasped the full extent of the company's potential liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's disclosures have exposed Nissan to intense
scrutiny and left many wondering whether Renault kicked the tires
hard enough before making its offer on Tuesday. Renault's proposal
to acquire 35 percent of Nissan, which the Japanese automaker's
board is expected to accept on Friday, could provide as much as
$5.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   According to two fund managers and a fund-management analyst who
have been briefed by Daimler, the more its team looked at Nissan,
the more exposure there seemed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``In having to defend itself, the news that's coming out of
DaimlerChrysler about Nissan is not very positive,'' one of the
fund managers said.
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with DaimlerChrysler's research suggested that
Nissan's true liabilities _ not just debt but also such potential
obligations as pension contributions and hidden debts _ were twice
as great as the $21.2 billion that is publicly known.
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistency in Renault's decision to bid and
DaimlerChrysler's decision to withdraw has left investors
skeptical, which is reflected in the depressed stock price of
Nissan and Renault. Credit-rating agencies have also expressed
reservations, and financial news coverage has been muted on what
would be a major foreign rescue of a leading Japanese corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there is avid interest in matters like the steep
erosion in Nissan's sales in Japan, the effect of the stronger yen
on overseas sales, the higher-than-average interest rates Nissan is
paying and the shortage in its pension fund. Some Japanese have
long agonized over such things, but now these are gaining
international attention.
</P>
<P>
   There is little concern that Renault has the financial resources
to pay for a Nissan stake _ the French company is debt-free, has
ample lines of credit, and is 44 percent-owned by the French
government. Renault executives also insist they have an accurate
reading on Nissan's business, including its debts.
</P>
<P>
   According to a person close to the two companies' negotiations,
Nissan had at first been willing to supply only limited, and
opaque, information about its liabilities. But in recent weeks, it
gave Renault executives answers that Renault considered
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not offer a firm figure, this person conceded
that Nissan's real indebtedness was certainly greater than the 2.5
trillion yen _ now $21.2 billion _ disclosed in the company's last
annual report, reflecting the fiscal year that ended on March 31,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan had an additional 1.8 trillion yen in liabilities related
to its auto-leasing business for a total of 4.3 trillion yen in
debt, although many analysts and auto-company executives do not
regard leasing-related debt as a matter of concern.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the automaker's indebtedness outside what it is
required to disclose that has concerned others, including
DaimlerChrysler. Such so-called off-balance-sheet risks have long
been rumored at Nissan and at other large Japanese companies, and
Daimler is not the first potential buyer to have been scared away
by them.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. is still smarting from the surprise it got when
it increased its stake in Mazda Motor Corp. to 33.4 percent in
1996, only to find out that Mazda's dealers had incurred enormous
debts for which Mazda was liable, Ford executives have said.

</P>
<P>
   Just last month, the Japanese Life Insurance Association
abandoned its efforts to sell Aoba Life Insurance Co. after a big
French concern, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, cut its original bid in
half. Previously, the American International Group, the insurer and
financial-services company, was the leading suitor, but it walked
away.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is rampant that, among other things, Aoba was more
financially problematic than the suitors had been able to see from
public documents. ``No investment banker is being candid about what
happened there,'' said Craig Chudler, an equity strategist at Nikko
Salomon Smith Barney. ``But I think AIG and Pinault must have seen
something that shocked them.''
</P>
<P>
   Large Japanese companies such as Nissan are structured so that a
vast galaxy of satellite companies, typically suppliers of parts
and services, are locked into orbit around them by a combination of
investments, loans and business relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The potential liabilities associated with many of those
companies _ the losses they sustain, the debts they cannot repay,
the shortages in their pension funds _ often ultimately fall upon
the main company but are not fully reflected in its public
financial records, nor is such disclosure required.
</P>
<P>
   If, for instance, the core company's investment in a satellite
is now worth half what it originally paid, the decline in value is
not necessarily reflected on the balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan, for instance, has 201 affiliates whose overall
performance is reflected in its financial statements. Beyond that
cluster, Nissan is linked to 389 companies whose fortunes are not
reflected on its books but whose problems may become its own.
</P>
<P>
   Keiichi Tsuboi, a spokesman for Nissan, noted that its interests
in those 389 companies constitute less than 10 percent of its total
revenue on a consolidated basis, a limit imposed by Japanese
accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there are debts at the unconsolidated companies,
but we don't think the total debt is significant,'' Tsuboi said.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1, many of the off-balance-sheet liabilities must
start to appear on financial statements under new accounting rules
that are expected to shake corporate Japan to its foundations _
though many obligations like loan guarantees may still remain
hidden.
</P>
<P>
   The new accounting rules will expose just the sort of
off-balance-sheet problems that Nissan disclosed last week. Its
plans to recapitalize the troubled sales unit of its troubled
truck-making affiliate, Nissan Diesel Motor Co., further raised
sensitivity to the issue of unseen liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan and Nissan Diesel said they would each invest 20 billion
yen ($170 million) in the unit, Nissan Diesel Sales Co., even
though Nissan's only exposure to it was through its 39.8 percent
stake in Nissan Diesel. ``A gap has emerged between the book value
of the investment made in domestic dealerships which are owned by
Nissan Diesel Motor Sales and the real value of those
dealerships,'' Nissan said in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
   The gap Nissan referred to was equivalent to roughly half the
book value of the investment in the sales unit, and its magnitude
surprised many analysts. Nissan Diesel sold only half as many
trucks last year as the year before, leaving its dealers with
bloated inventories and no way to repay their loans.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts had suspected as much, but because the sales unit
is not a public company and does not disclose financial
information, the analysts had no way of gauging the extent of
Nissan's exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm just stupid, but I had no idea the losses in that
business would run so high,'' said Peter Boardman of Warburg Dillon
Read here. ``Yes, it was good news in that they were able to
overcome a crisis, but it also allowed the market to see how big
the losses were.''

<P>
   Reforms enacted by the International Olympic Committee this week
fail to ensure a new, more ethical era for the Games, according to
a US Senator poised to investigate the IOC and its chief corporate
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Both Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) and David D'Alessandro,
president of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., said
Thursday that IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch must appoint
independent officials to two committees established by the IOC in
Lausanne, Switzerland Thursday to oversee the ethics of members and
to consider restructuring the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcement that Mr. Samaranch intends to oversee the
newly created IOC ethics commission causes great concern,'' said
McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which will
conduct a hearing on the IOC next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It displays a failure to grasp even the most basic concepts of
ethics and reform,'' McCain said. ``This is clearly a conflict of
interest...I'm afraid the IOC leadership is less concerned about
reform than preserving the power of an elite few.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, speaking to reporters in Lausanne, said the Olympic
charter requires that he both appoint and chair any IOC-sanctioned
commission. Asked why he is presiding, Samaranch said: ``Because I
am the president. That is why I will preside.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro, meanwhile, said: ``I think Samaranch is having
some trouble `getting it,' at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinarily important to see who is on those
committees,'' D'Alessandro said. ``If they are all the old Olympic
group, people who have been involved off and on for years, than
it's not going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted separately, officials of six of the other 10 Worldwide
Sponsors of the IOC _ representing almost $1 billion in Olympic
financing _ said with near unanimity Thursday that while the
reforms are important, they represent only early steps in a long
process toward restoring the image of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive step that they came out and said they would
take certain actions, and they followed through,'' said Karl
Langsenkamp, director of public relations for Xerox. ``I don't
think it's the end, certainly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xerox, like the other companies involved _ and, I'm sure, the
American people _ are going to be gauging the strength of the
follow up by the IOC, and watching the other investigations that
are ongoing, to see what occurs,'' Langsenkamp said.
</P>
<P>
   In Lausanne Thursday, the IOC, as expected, took several steps
toward reform in the wake of the $1.2 million bribery scandal
involving the selection of Salt Lake City as the site of the Winter
Games in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The committee:
</P>
<P>
   --Adopted a new system to select the site for the 2006 games
that forbids IOC members to visit the various bid cities. A
15-member committee, including IOC members, outside advisers and
athletes will narrow the current field of six cities to two
finalists. The full assembly of the IOC will then choose the
finalists.
</P>
<P>
   --Established an ethics committee to oversee members, with a
majority of members from outside the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   --Created ``IOC 2000,'' which will study the structure of the
group and consider issues like how members are elected, the length
of their terms and the distribution of power.
</P>
<P>
   --Issued an audit by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, that pegged the
net worth of the IOC at $136 million at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As always with the IOC, long considered the most closed and
conservative of international sports bodies, observers wondered who
will appoint and control the new committees. For McCain and
D'Alessandro, the answer was clear: Juan Antonio Samaranch, the
78-year-old patriarch of the Olympic movement, who is often
criticized for running an autocracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to agree to have oversight and an ethics commission,
and to study term limits is real progress,'' D'Alessandro said.
``It would would have been unthinkable just some months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, it's not reform yet.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro, who for months has said publicly what some other
international sponsors of the game have said only privately, added
that what had been called for in Lausanne was much stronger, more
independent leadership.
</P>
<P>
   What Samaranch should have said, according to D'Alessandro, is
that the ethics commission should be entirely independent, IOC
members will be chosen by the individual countries represented by
the committee, with everyone's term limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they got as much done as they could with Samaranch in
place,'' he said. ``But I think he's been energized by some
anti-American sentiment that's saying, `We can't listen to the
Americans.' Well, we contribute 70 percent of their budget. As long
as they take our money, they can take out complaints. Or, just
write us a check for our money, and we'll go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 worldwide sponsors of the IOC pay an average of $40
million for four-year contracts to use the Olympic symbol and
emblems, mascots and other game icons as part of their advertising
and promotional activities. Six of those sponsors said Thursday
that while the steps toward reform taken by the IOC were the best
news in months, it must be equally effective in following through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC made progress in addressing the improprieties of the
past and more importantly focused on the future by establishing
specific measures for 2006 host-city selection and organizational
reform,'' said Ben Deutsch, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, Inc.
``Ultimately the success of what was outlined this week is going to
be judged by the IOC's ability to define, embrace and enforce the
new reform.''

WALTER D. SCOTT, EX-CHIEF WHO LED NBC INTO COLOR PROGRAMMING, DIES
AT 84  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Mo, Texas, Va.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Decker Scott, who stepped down as chairman of NBC in 1974
after a 36-year career that spanned the heyday of network radio and
TV's golden age, died on March 12 at Carmel Valley Manor, a
retirement home in Carmel, Calif. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from pneumonia, NBC said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who joined the National Broadcasting Company as a
salesman in 1937, led the network in the mid-1960s, when it
committed itself to color programming. NBC occasionally had shown
color programming since the 1950s, but some executives were wary of
making a costly commitment to the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Scott based his decision in part on data showing that families
with color sets watched television more than did families that
owned only black-and-white sets. He was credited with persuading
the network hierarchy, as well as those in charge at the corporate
parent, the Radio Corporation of America, and the film studios to
risk the significant increases in production costs.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal led to the adoption of a color schedule at NBC in
1965. A slogan advertising the new standard, ``The Full Color
Network,'' lives on in NBC's peacock logo.
</P>
<P>
   He was named chairman and chief executive in 1966. He was also
elected a director of RCA, which was bought by General Electric in
1985.

THE ETHICS OF WORM HUNTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH   
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A fascinating sidelight to Worm Watch '99 is how
the media _ mainstream, tabloid and otherwise _ has been
disseminating information about Dennis Rodman's disappearance from
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be a matter of how much we need to know versus how
much we want to know, with the fact most of us are bored by his
boorish behavior somewhat factored in.
</P>
<P>
   From the Lakers' end, team spokesmen continue to say Rodman is
away on ``personal non-basketball business.'' That's the polite way
of saying: ``That's all we need to tell you.'' The Lakers, by the
way, also reported that Magic Johnson missed a game with the flu
the day before he came out in 1991 and announced he contracted HIV.
</P>
<P>
   This Lakers stance leaves the door open to widespread
speculation. Drugs? Alcohol? Gambling? Some kind of freak accident
(no pun intended)? Is he on another suicide watch? Or, as the
Dallas Morning News' Frank Luksa suggests, this could simply mean
Rodman went shopping for a dress.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's telecast from Minnesota, Chick Hearn _ who
about 10 years ago less-than-tactfully handled James Worthy's
disappearance from the team on a road trip in Houston _ read a memo
that ``Rodman's people'' sent to the team thanking the fans, his
teammates and management for understanding his need for the time
off. Hearn could have left it at that, but he added a line of
information about a Rodman sighting over the weekend in Las Vegas.
Hearn said it was because Rodman has business to tend to in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, on KLAC's ``Laker Line'' radio post-game talk show,
callers kept throwing Rodman rumors out to host Larry Burnett. He
would not even get close to legitimizing them other than to say
he's heard them but would leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. That's probably the way it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Except this is Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly invites people into his bizarre life by writing
two tell-all books, ``Bad As I Want To Be'' followed by ``A Walk On
The Wild Side.'' He's likely saving material from this episode for
a third book, ``I Did It My Way.'' Also, as Phil Mushnick points
out in the latest TV Guide, ESPN's ``Up Close'' has had Rodman on
as a guest eight times in the last five years _ far more than
anyone else. And that's not counting his appearances with Jay Leno
on ``The Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Rodman acts as if he doesn't want to draw attention,
he lives off it.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Rodman showed up at the end of practice and told
coach Kurt Rambis he wasn't making the plane trip to Sacramento and
several newspaper reporters documented the bizarre event. The next
day, speculation about Rodman's ``personal crisis'' started.
</P>
<P>
   Any quotes directly from Rodman? Only a cryptic one to TNT's
Craig Sager. Other than that, news on Rodman has come from those
infamous nameless, faceless sources _ which, we hate to admit, are
sometimes nothing more than the reporter himself hearing enough
rumors to believe he has cause to write something.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to competitive celebrity journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet and sports-talk radio dove in immediately with the
usual widespread spectrum of conclusions. Then Monday, the National
Enquirer contributed with a wild account of Rodman and wife Carmen
Electra's dual infidelity that has brought Pamela Anderson's
ex-husband Tommy Lee into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   So does this mean it's all on the record for the ``mainstream''
media to pick up and report? We're treading on Lewinsky-Clinton
ground now. Let's back up a minute.
</P>
<P>
   The original question _ why is Rodman missing? _ has been
answered, however lamely, to the team's satisfaction but maybe not
to the public's infatuation.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe the public just doesn't care anymore and the media
should start being more in tune with that.
</P>
<P>
   If this is fodder for a third book, eventually Rodman will
benefit financially from releasing the information and that could
be the only reason he's upset anything is coming out right now.
</P>
<P>
   This really !ital!is!off Rodman's business. The media should
leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   But why does the media care so much about Dennis Rodman? Why
does the public care?
</P>
<P>
   Because it's as if we're watching Rodman in a low-speed police
chase down the freeway, knowing what could happen next. Rodman is
that guy on the freeway overpass with his truck on fire leaning
into the back to grab a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time to act responsibly and just turn the camera
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Challenge'' bonus round: Did you know Joe DiMaggio made
16 appearances on the old ``Sports Challenge'' TV show? Series
producer Dan Marrin called to add that fact the other day from his
home in Santa Monica after reading about the ESPN Classic tribute
to DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee Clipper was also paid the same as Jackie Robinson and
Ted Williams and all the rest who came on _ $317.63, which was the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) scale
wage.
</P>
<P>
   Marrin, who sold the rights to the shows to former Classic
Sports Channel co-founder Steve Greenberg _ whose father, Hall of
Famer Hank Greenberg, was once a mystery guest _ said the most
successful three-man team ever on the show was the Lakers with
Jerry West, Gail Goodrich and Happy Hairston.
</P>
<P>
   ``West knew everything about every sport,'' said Marrin. ``He,
Tommy Henrich and Red Auerbach were the three most knowledgeable
sports guests.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN Classic, by the way, has back-to-back ``Sports Challenge''
shows twice a day Monday through Friday from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. and 8
p.m. to 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   And don't be surprised if a new ``Sports Challenge''
materialized someday on ESPN. Marrin says he's been in discussions
about trying to get it up and running again.
</P>
<P>
   He said paying the participants would be a challenge, but the
rights fees to use old film and video clips these days make a show
like this more prohibitive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
_Kevin Kennedy, runner-up for the Dodgers managerial job last
winter, has found another way to draw checks from Rupert Murdoch:
He's been hired as a Fox Sports News baseball studio analyst. The
Tarzana resident and Valley native _ who also runs a baseball
academy in Arleta primarily for Japanese players _ loves the fact
he can stay home most days rather than the nearly daily travel he
was doing the past few years as a game analyst for ESPN. Kennedy,
who will also get to do game analysis work on the Fox Sports Net
Thursday night game of the week, doesn't anticipate that viewers
will read into his analysis any personal agenda when he critiques
managers or players _ especially the Dodgers personnel. ``I'll be
objective no matter who I'm talking about,'' he said. ``I'm a
baseball guy. That (agenda) won't be an issue. I enjoy explaining
how and why things happen in the game. I'm in a really nice
situation that I'd like to stay in for a long time.'' &QL; 
_The Walt Hazzard ``cover story'' piece that aired on Wednesday's
ESPN ``SportsCenter.'' The pictures of Hazzard's recovery process
from a stroke suffered three years ago were compelling enough, but
the interviews reporter Shelly Smith did with Hazzard's family were
equally upbeat and heartwarming. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
_Promoter Don King made a reported $8 million from the $60 million
pay-per-view take of last week's Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis
bout that HBO will replay tonight at 10. Imagine him not wanting a
rematch. &QL; 
_In order to cram every women's regional semifinal game live into
the ESPN-ESPN2 domain Saturday, the last contest _ UCLA vs.
Colorado State _ tips off at 9:30 p.m. from the fan-friendly Sports
Arena. On the East Coast, that's 12:30 a.m. Sunday. Pam Ward and
Vera Jones are on the call for ESPN. &QL; 
_!bold!Craig Kilborn sightings at the NCAA Tournament as the
network helps promote his arrival on CBS in Tom Snyder's old 1:35
a.m. slot starting in a few weeks. &QL; 
_Fox Sports Net's ``Goin' Deep'' with Chris Myers (Sunday, 9 p.m.)
goes into former UCLA basketball coach John Wooden's Encino home
for a Q-and-A. Which sounds kinda cool, except the fact Fox has an
investment in making Wooden look good _ it has a deal to announce
the Wooden Award winner on a Fox Sports News broadcast in a few
weeks. &QL; 
_At a sports radio conference this week in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
1150-AM program director Mike Thompson co-chaired a seminar called
``How to identify real talent.'' &QL; 
_Last Friday was Bud Furillo's last day as a sports-talk host in
Palm Springs. He'd like to come back into the L.A. market with
something as simple as a weekend sports-talk show. Any takers?

SMS COACH MUST MAKE GOLIATH-BUSTERS OF HIS DAVIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Duke sophomore forward Elton Brand was
walking from the interview area to the locker room Thursday
afternoon when he passed members of the Southwest Missouri State
team, who were standing in the hallway. It was quite a spectacle:
Brand, trailed by a throng of reporters, looked forward and smiled
as he entertained questions.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri State players, who meet the top-ranked,
top-seeded Blue Devils (34-1) in Friday's NCAA Tournament East
Regional semifinal (7:38), ceased their conversations and stared at
the procession until Brand all but disappeared from view.
</P>
<P>
   SMS coach Steve Alford said the matchup has a
``David-vs.-Goliath-type of atmosphere.'' Anyone unfamiliar with
college basketball needed only to be in the hallway to know which
team represented David and which was the big guy.
</P>
<P>
   Alford has his work cut out for him. Sometime between Thursday
afternoon and Friday night, he must find a way to wipe the looks of
awe from his players' faces. If Brand can strike wonder in SMS by
merely walking through a corridor, imagine the impression he'll
leave after tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th-seeded Bears (22-10) are 28-point underdogs entering
Friday night's game, and many figure the outcome will be decided
long before the final buzzer. In the other East Regional semifinal,
sixth-seeded Temple (23-10) meets 10th-seeded Purdue (21-12) at
9:55 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   You figure any team that believes it doesn't have a shot at
victory shouldn't bother showing up. Alford dismissed the notion
that the team would register a moral victory by being competitive.
`I am sure there aren't many people in this (interview) room that
picked us over Wisconsin and Tennessee (SMS's first- and second-
round opponents) and we were able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet believing you can beat Duke because you beat Wisconsin and
Tennessee is like believing a Hyundai can outperform a Bentley
because it excelled over a couple of Buicks. Here are a few reasons
SMS players had every right to be in awe of the Blue Devils:
</P>
<P>
   --Duke is in its 16th regional semifinal and is playing its 15th
game in the Meadowlands, where it has advanced to the Final Four
four times and has a 13-1 record. The two-time national champions
(1991-92) are the winningest team in tournament history with a
62-20 mark and a .756 winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   --The Blue Devils own college basketball's longest winning
streak (29), and it their last 10 games, no team has come within 15
points of beating them. They lead the nation in scoring (93.6
points per game), scoring margin (26.3), and are second in field
goal percentage (51.7).
</P>
<P>
   --Duke's projected starting lineup (guards Trajan Langdon and
William Avery, forwards Chris Carrawell and Shane Battier and
center Brand) is 20-0 this season.
</P>
<P>
   --Brand is a first-team All-American, a Sporting News national
player of the year and joins Langdon as a Wooden and Naismith award
finalist. The Blue Devils' roster includes nine former high school
All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are dominant,'' said Alford. ``We come into this
tournament with a 20.5 (point) win margin. After five days of
watching tape, I'm trying to figure out how to get out of East
Rutherford with a win margin. We know we are going to have to play
very, very well, but that's what the game is played for.''
</P>
<P>
   SMS would also benefit from Duke overconfidence, but Brand said
that won't be likely. ``Coach (Mike) Krzyzewski has prepared many
great teams and many great ballplayers before us,'' said Brand. He
really lets us know what's going to happen before it even
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Many figure the Temple-Purdue game to be more compelling. The
contests matches two scrappy, physical teams that play tough
defense. Both reached the regional semifinal with second-round
upsets, Temple over third-seeded Cincinnati, Purdue over
second-seeded Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think whoever gets the lead first will have some control,''
said Purdue coach Gene Keady. ``We really don't care about the
pace. I think the main thing is the control of Temple's offense
with our defense.''

<P>
   Reforms enacted by the International Olympic Committee this week
fail to ensure a new, more ethical era for the Games, according to
a US Senator poised to investigate the IOC and its chief corporate
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Both Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) and David D'Alessandro,
president of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., said
Thursday that IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch must appoint
independent officials to two committees established by the IOC in
Lausanne, Switzerland Thursday to oversee the ethics of members and
to consider restructuring the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcement that Mr. Samaranch intends to oversee the
newly created IOC ethics commission causes great concern,'' said
McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which will
conduct a hearing on the IOC next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It displays a failure to grasp even the most basic concepts of
ethics and reform,'' McCain said. ``This is clearly a conflict of
interest...I'm afraid the IOC leadership is less concerned about
reform than preserving the power of an elite few.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, speaking to reporters in Lausanne, said the Olympic
charter requires that he both appoint and chair any IOC-sanctioned
commission. Asked why he is presiding, Samaranch said: ``Because I
am the president. That is why I will preside.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro, meanwhile, said: ``I think Samaranch is having
some trouble `getting it,' at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinarily important to see who is on those
committees,'' D'Alessandro said. ``If they are all the old Olympic
group, people who have been involved off and on for years, than
it's not going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted separately, officials of six of the other 10 Worldwide
Sponsors of the IOC _ representing almost $1 billion in Olympic
financing _ said with near unanimity Thursday that while the
reforms are important, they represent only early steps in a long
process toward restoring the image of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive step that they came out and said they would
take certain actions, and they followed through,'' said Karl
Langsenkamp, director of public relations for Xerox. ``I don't
think it's the end, certainly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xerox, like the other companies involved _ and, I'm sure, the
American people _ are going to be gauging the strength of the
follow up by the IOC, and watching the other investigations that
are ongoing, to see what occurs,'' Langsenkamp said.
</P>
<P>
   In Lausanne Thursday, the IOC, as expected, took several steps
toward reform in the wake of the $1.2 million bribery scandal
involving the selection of Salt Lake City as the site of the Winter
Games in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The committee:
</P>
<P>
   --Adopted a new system to select the site for the 2006 games
that forbids IOC members to visit the various bid cities. A
15-member committee, including IOC members, outside advisers and
athletes will narrow the current field of six cities to two
finalists. The full assembly of the IOC will then choose the
finalists.
</P>
<P>
   --Established an ethics committee to oversee members, with a
majority of members from outside the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   --Created ``IOC 2000,'' which will study the structure of the
group and consider issues like how members are elected, the length
of their terms and the distribution of power.
</P>
<P>
   --Issued an audit by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, that pegged the
net worth of the IOC at $136 million at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As always with the IOC, long considered the most closed and
conservative of international sports bodies, observers wondered who
will appoint and control the new committees. For McCain and
D'Alessandro, the answer was clear: Juan Antonio Samaranch, the
78-year-old patriarch of the Olympic movement, who is often
criticized for running an autocracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to agree to have oversight and an ethics commission,
and to study term limits is real progress,'' D'Alessandro said.
``It would would have been unthinkable just some months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, it's not reform yet.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro, who for months has said publicly what some other
international sponsors of the game have said only privately, added
that what had been called for in Lausanne was much stronger, more
independent leadership.
</P>
<P>
   What Samaranch should have said, according to D'Alessandro, is
that the ethics commission should be entirely independent, IOC
members will be chosen by the individual countries represented by
the committee, with everyone's term limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they got as much done as they could with Samaranch in
place,'' he said. ``But I think he's been energized by some
anti-American sentiment that's saying, `We can't listen to the
Americans.' Well, we contribute 70 percent of their budget. As long
as they take our money, they can take out complaints. Or, just
write us a check for our money, and we'll go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 worldwide sponsors of the IOC pay an average of $40
million for four-year contracts to use the Olympic symbol and
emblems, mascots and other game icons as part of their advertising
and promotional activities. Six of those sponsors said Thursday
that while the steps toward reform taken by the IOC were the best
news in months, it must be equally effective in following through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC made progress in addressing the improprieties of the
past and more importantly focused on the future by establishing
specific measures for 2006 host-city selection and organizational
reform,'' said Ben Deutsch, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, Inc.
``Ultimately the success of what was outlined this week is going to
be judged by the IOC's ability to define, embrace and enforce the
new reform.''

BOSTON BANK OF COMMERCE SEEKS MERGER WITH CARVER BANCORP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Having recovered from years of nearly fatal loan
losses and a bitter internal power struggle, Boston Bank of
Commerce said Thursday it is attempting to merge with another
black-owned bank, the troubled Carver Bancorp. of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Bank of Commerce officials said they hope it is the first
step in assembling a franchise of minority-owned banks across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to grow by leaps and bounds is to acquire,'' said
Robert Patrick Cooper, Boston Bank of Commerce's senior counsel.
``We intend to do that nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Flush with capital and growing 33 percent a year on loans since
1996, Cooper said Boston Bank of Commerce, the city's only
black-owned bank, acquired 7 percent of Carver Bancorp.'s shares
over past months. Thursday it filed documents with the Securities
and Exchange Commission formally ``stating its interest in a
merger.''
</P>
<P>
   One catch in the deal, however, is that Carver Bancorp. doesn't
want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding is that Carver's board does not believe a
combination is in the best interest of their shareholders at this
time,'' Boston Bank of Commerce said in a statement. Carver
Bancorp. officials couldn't be reached Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cooper said Carver Bancorp.'s shareholders could be
receptive to the deal and force the board to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've accumulated a significant position in the company, and
we think our voice can be heard,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   While terms of a deal have yet to be hammered out, Cooper said
under Boston Bank of Commerce's proposal, the $400 million Carver
Bancorp. would buy the much smaller $108 million Boston Bank of
Commerce. But the new company would be controlled and managed by
Boston Bank of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Carver Bancorp., whose shares are traded on the American Stock
Exchange, has run up huge losses in recent years at its Carver
Federal Savings Bank in Harlem. Mounting financial problems in its
loan portfolio earlier this year forced the bank to disclose it
would likely report a loss of at least $5 million in the fourth
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they get out of this deal is a seasoned management team
that knows the African American market and knows how to turn around
a troubled institution,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Bank of Commerce, founded in 1966 as Unity Bank, was one
of the first local banks to make home loans minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The bank got hurt in the real estate crash of the early 1990s,
losing $3.5 million in three years. Regulators threatened to close
it down in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It was rescued by a Boston couple, Kevin Cohee and Teri
Williams, who invested $1 million and saved the bank.
</P>
<P>
   A bitter struggle for power ensued, resulting in the ouster of
chairman and chief executive Ronald Homer, who then sued the bank
for wrongful termination. The suit was settled for an undisclosed
sum.

   The deadlock in the sanctions committee, which is composed of
the same nations as the 15-member Security Council, reflects the
continuing disagreement in the council over policy toward Iraq. A
similar debate last year also ended in disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said the plane that the Saudi authorities
detained at Jidda airport was carrying 111 Iraqis traveling to
Mecca for the haj, the pilgrimage to Mohammed's birthplace required
once in a lifetime of all pious Muslims who can afford it. Another
flight of 110 Iraqi pilgrims landed the previous day, but was
permitted to return to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Abdulrahman al-Ahmed, the Saudi charge d'affaires at the United
Nations, appealed on Wednesday in a letter to the sanctions
committee for guidance as to whether the Saudis should continue
holding the plane. The letter said that if the United Nations did
not provide advice on the issue by 11 a.m. Thursday, the Saudis
would ``allow the plane and crew to return to Iraq,'' which they
did.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said the sanctions committee held an emergency meeting
Thursday morning to examine the issue of whether U.N. resolutions,
in effect, provide for an air embargo against Iraq. The U.N. legal
adviser argued, as he did last year, that the resolutions required
Iraq to seek the committee's permission for all flights, even those
of a religious or relief nature, and that Iraq had failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats who attended the meeting said this view, which was
strongly endorsed by the American and British delegates, had been
vigorously challenged by Russia, France and China, among others,
which maintained that flights of no commercial or military benefit
to Iraq were exempt from the resolution's reporting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no consensus in the end,'' said Peter Van Walsum,
the Dutch representative on the Security Council who heads the
sanctions committee. ``So I concluded the only thing I could do was
thank the Saudi government for having brought the matter to our
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. resolutions provide for the seizure of assets in connection
with flights that take place without the committee's approval. But
Baghdad appeared to draw the obvious political lesson from the
sanctions committee's paralysis Thursday and flew a third plane of
pilgrims to Saudi Arabia, again without requesting the committee's
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has repeatedly used the haj to test the limits of the
sanctions regime, which faces increasing opposition in the world
body. In a related issue, the council has remained unable to devise
a financial system to defray the cost of the pilgrimage for Iraqi
Muslims. Last year, the council agreed that some of the oil money
that Iraq is allowed to spend on imports like food could also be
used to subsidize haj pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the committee created a voucher system under which
Iraqi pilgrims received a certificate in Baghdad that they could
exchange for cash in Saudi banks. But many pilgrims complained that
the system was inconvenient and humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   This year the committee agreed that pilgrims could collect their
money in cash before leaving Baghdad, but the deal collapsed when
Iraq and the sanctions committee disagreed over how the money would
be distributed. Iraq wanted the money paid to its central bank,
which would then distribute it to travelers. But the council said
such payments would breach economic sanctions and set a dangerous
precedent. Instead, it proposed that the Red Cross or another
independent agency distribute the funds. Iraq rejected this
proposal too, resulting in a deadlock.

POPULAR INTELLECTUAL MAGAZINE   IS SHUT IN CRACKDOWN BY BEIJING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The authorities have shut down a popular intellectual
magazine here for ``reorganization,'' the latest move in an uneven
tightening of controls over liberal publications.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly magazine, called Way, has a circulation of 20,000
and is widely read in academic circles. In recent years, under the
banner of interdisciplinary inquiry, it had branched out from its
original mandate to focus on the natural sciences, carrying essays
on the nature of freedom, the rule of law and the dangers of
totalitarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the authorities warned the editors to stick to more
scientific topics and the subsequent two issues were, in fact, far
less venturesome. But last week the Administration of Press and
Publications, which regulates books, magazines and newspapers on
behalf of the Communist Party, said Way must stop publishing while
it undergoes reorganization and changes its content.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's editorial director, Feng Xiaozhe, said in an
interview that the editors were trying to cooperate with the
authorities and hoped they could resume publishing within a few
months. He said it was too soon to know whether any editors would
be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a total liquidation of the magazine but a
temporary matter that we hope to resolve as soon as possible,''
Feng said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months, the authorities have closed or put
pressure on several liberal newspapers, magazines and book
publishers across the country, apparently reflecting official
nervousness in a year when social stability has been named the
paramount goal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fearing economic unrest, the leaders may fear
dissent related to the 10th anniversary of the suppression of the
student democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in June,
and the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Communist state on
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by historical standards here, the intellectual crackdown
is relatively mild and inconsistent. Even as the authorities
intimidate or close some publications, many other magazines,
journals and books continue to appear that criticize directions of
society or delve into sensitive aspects of Communist Party history.
</P>
<P>
   This month in a rare direct attack on a major government policy,
an intellectual journal, called Strategy and Management, contained
a scathing critique of the social effects of the Three Gorges Dam
project on the Yangtze River. So far that journal, which has also
carried provocative articles on political subjects, has not been
disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest repressive acts was the indefinite
suspension, on Dec. 29, of the Chinese-language book operations of
China Today Press. The press had published an influential, frank
series of books on topics like corruption and ideological disputes,
and a path-breaking collection of essays on political reform.
</P>
<P>
   The staff of the press is now undergoing ``rectification,''
forced to study ideology and engage in written and verbal
self-criticism.

NEW METEORITE EVIDENCE BOLSTERS LIFE-ON-MARS THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ New evidence presented here Thursday greatly
strengthens the case for the existence of traces of bacterial life
inside meteorites from Mars, and for the first time adds strong
indications that such bacteria may still be alive today beneath the
Martian surface.
</P>
<P>
   The new signs of relic Martian life, unlike those first
presented in August 1996, look exactly like known fossils of Earth
life forms in their size, shape, and arrangement. And for the first
time, such apparent fossil formations have been found inside three
different meteorites, which formed on Mars during different eras.
</P>
<P>
   The new discoveries raise the strong prospect of a final
resolution to the fierce arguments among scientists over whether
these shapes found in rocks from Mars really are signs of life on
the red planet. After two-and-a-half years of controversy, the case
could be closed, one way or the other, within the next year, some
of the scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the scientists who have been most skeptical of the
original claims of possible fossils in a Mars rock have begun to
temper their criticism. For example, some of those who claimed that
the rock formed at too high a temperature for life to have existed
inside it have now retracted such claims, in light of new evidence
that shows the rock could have formed at much lower temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The new possible fossil shapes were found inside a meteorite
called Nakhla, which fell in the Sahara desert in 1911 and was
collected within a day of its impact. This greatly lessens the
possibility that anything found inside it could be the result of
terrestrial contamination, as some scientists have argued may be
the case with the suspected fossils reported in 1996 inside a
meteorite called ALH 84001. That meteorite lay on the ice in
Antarctica for 13,000 years before being found,
</P>
<P>
   In addition, while ALH 84001 is a rock that formed on Mars 4.3
billion years ago, Nakhla formed 1.3 billion years ago. Similar
possible fossils were also reported here Thursday inside yet
another meteorite from Mars, called Shergotty, which formed just
165 million years ago. If scientists can confirm that these really
are fossils of bacterial life on Mars, the long time span covered
by the three samples would make it very likely that such life would
still exist there now. Such life would have to be under the
planet's surface, which, because of ultra-violet radiation, is
inhospitable to life as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this proves out, we will have shown that life spans the
entire history of Mars, and is probably there today,'' said David
McKay, a scientist at NASA's Johnson Space Center who was the
leader of the team that reported the original signs of life in a
Mars meteorite and also led the team reporting these new findings.
</P>
<P>
   But McKay stressed that there are still some crucial tests that
must be carried out to prove, first of all, that the suggestive
shapes found inside the rocks truly are fossils of living
organisms, and second, that these organisms are Martian, not Earth
bacteria that somehow contaminated the rocks after they fell.
</P>
<P>
   Study of the chemical composition of these shapes, which is just
beginning, could provide clear evidence of their biological nature,
McKay said. And study of the different forms, or isotopes, of
certain atoms inside these formations could also prove decisively _
or disprove _ their Martian origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not claiming I have found new evidence for life on
Mars,'' McKay said. ``I have found features that have a startling
resemblance to known fossil life. I have not proven they are
bacteria. I have not proven they are from Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the answers should be known within about a year.
``My guess is that that material is all Martian,'' he said,
pointing out that many of the apparent bacterial forms seem to be
embedded in the rock itself.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the preliminary indications are far more positive than
they were for the original shapes found inside ALH 84001, McKay and
other scientists said during the annual Lunar and Planetary Science
Conference held here at the space center, where the new evidence
was presented.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``fossils'' were much smaller than any form of life
known to exist on Earth, and there were no clear signs of processes
such as cell division that would help to confirm their biological
nature. By contrast, the newly discovered shapes inside the Nakhla
meteorite are a perfect match for known terrestrial bacteria, and
include a chain of three apparent cells that match the way some
known bacteria divide and reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't tell people where the sample was from,'' said
McKay, ``a paleontologist would probably say `those are bacteria.'
''
</P>
<P>
   If McKay's discoveries are confirmed by further analysis, it
could have a profound impact on all planning for future Mars
missions, especially possible human missions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an active biosphere on Mars, how should astronauts
deal with that? Is it dangerous or not? We need to evaluate that.''

ADVERTISERS PAY $1   MILLION FOR 30-SECONDS DURING THE OSCARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never mind Shakespeare. It's Madison Avenue that's in love _
with Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation of the 71st annual Academy Awards, to be
broadcast on Sunday by ABC, will be ``brought to you by'' about 15
blue-chip advertisers paying an average of $1 million for each
30-second spot. That price, up 9.3 percent from an average $915,000
last year, is a historic high for the Oscars, reflecting the appeal
of the awards show as well as the current robust market for
commercial time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You swallow deep'' before spending such sums, said one
advertiser, Robert Fisher, president at Gap Inc. in San Francisco.
``But the entertainment value makes it the right thing for us to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers besides Gap will include AT&AMP;T, American Express,
Eastman Kodak, First Union, General Motors, McDonald's, Merrill
Lynch, Pepsi-Cola, the Pepsi-Lipton Tea Partnership, Charles Schwab
and Sears, Roebuck.
</P>
<P>
   If that seems like a Super Bowl sponsor lineup, it's no
coincidence: the parallels this year between the two are
significant enough to consider designating the program Oscar Bowl
LXXI.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the commercial rates are the second highest for
the year after the Super Bowl, an acknowledgment that the Oscar
broadcast annually is usually the second-most-watched program after
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For another, for the first time, there will be Hollywood
equivalents of the Super Bowl pre-game and post-game shows: a
30-minute ``Oscar Preview'' program covering the celebrities'
arrival at the ceremony and an hourlong ``Politically Incorrect
Afterparty'' following the announcement of the choice for Best
Picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars are being held on a Sunday night, just like the Super
Bowl. That shift from Monday to Sunday _ the night with more
households watching television than any other _ should compensate
for any decline in ratings from last year's show, the most watched
in 15 years because of interest in the hugely popular nominee
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for a good number'' in the Nielsen ratings, said
Marv Goldsmith, president for sales and marketing at the ABC
Television Network unit of ABC in New York, a division of Walt
Disney Co. that recently signed an agreement to broadcast the
Oscars through 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratings have fluctuated over the years because the broad
appeal of the movies is something you can't control,'' he added.
``But it is an event, an event that advertisers want to be part
of.''
</P>
<P>
   His remark points up that like the Super Bowl, the advertiser
ardor for the Academy Awards program is indicative of a growing
appetite for TV's so-called big events, the handful of shows that
still can draw huge audiences and ratings _ and presumably,
eyeballs to watch commercials _ as viewership for the broadcast
networks continues to erode.
</P>
<P>
   ``People spend a higher percentage of time watching the Academy
Awards than any other awards show,'' said Jon Mandel, co-managing
director at Mediacom in New York, the media services unit of Grey
Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a total convergence of fashion and entertainment, the
Oscars has taken on a life of its own,'' he added. ``And any time
you can get half or more of a demographic group watching a program,
it's a winner for advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to the fact that 61 percent of an important
audience for marketers, women ages 18 to 34, watched the Oscars in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell a lot of products to married women with children,
young adults and teen-agers, and this show delivers that kind of
audience,'' said Carl E. Gustin, senior vice president and chief
marketing officer at Kodak in Rochester. ``It's a wonderful
marketing tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodak, an Oscar advertiser since 1966, has bought two minutes of
commercial time to run three new spots from Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
Worldwide in New York, a unit of WPP Group PLC. In one spot, for
professional portrait photography, a mother watches her two
children grow before her eyes. The others promote Kodak films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought more spots this year than we normally do,'' Gustin
said, ``because we have more to say this year, spending more time
defining our brand as more than just the `yellow boxes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Two financial advertisers will also be running new brand work.
One is Schwab, introducing the first campaign from its new agency,
the BBDO New York unit of BBDO Worldwide, part of Omnicom Group.
The campaign will carry the theme ``Ready to move up?''
</P>
<P>
   The other is Merrill Lynch, bringing out more new spots from the
first campaign from its new agency, J. Walter Thompson New York,
owned by WPP. Two minutes of commercial time will be devoted to
that campaign, carrying the theme ``Human achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the largest event-type programs,'' said Paul W.
Critchlow, senior vice president for marketing and communications
at Merrill Lynch in New York, ``a great vehicle to reach a highly
affluent audience, but one that's broad-based.''
</P>
<P>
   Other marketers introducing commercials during the show are
seeking a showcase for products.
</P>
<P>
   Gap will present the sequel to last year's popular musical
pitches for khaki pants that included the energetic ``Khakis
swing.'' There will be three spots, created in-house, with country,
go-go and soul soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the Oscars as the ultimate night for entertainment,''
Fisher at Gap said. ``And these spots work so well with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gap and Sears jumped in as Oscar advertisers when the previous
retail apparel sponsor, J.C. Penney Co., ended its participation.
Similarly, Pepsi-Cola, a unit of Pepsico Inc., and the Pepsi-Lipton
partnership, a joint venture of Pepsico and Unilever, climbed
aboard when the Coca-Cola Co. exited the beverage category.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Academy Awards works for us on many different levels,''
said Dawn Hudson, senior vice president for strategy and marketing
at the Pepsi-Cola North America unit of Pepsi-Cola in Purchase,
N.Y. Four spots for Pepsi-Cola, by BBDO New York, will introduce
``The joy of cola'' as the brand's theme, replacing ``Generation
next.''
</P>
<P>
   The show ``helps us kick off the summer selling season,'' Ms.
Hudson said, because it is closer to that important period than the
Super Bowl, where the flagship Pepsi-Cola product traditionally had
been advertised. The Oscars also precedes a big promotion tied to
the next ``Star Wars'' film, she added.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a new spot by Thompson New York from the tea
partners, for Lipton Brisk iced tea, part of the continuing
campaign for that product carrying the theme ``That's Brisk,
baby.'' The spot features animated figurines of Sherman Hemsley and
Isabel Sanford (``The Jeffersons'') in a bizarre battle with a
figurine of the actor Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   In likening the Oscars to the Super Bowl, Ms. Hudson came up
with one more comparison: ``It's amazing how many people think I
have endless tickets to the Academy Awards show. They are very hot
properties.''

`ENLIBRA' AN EMERGING PHILOSOPHY IN LAND MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB TAYLOR  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber recently took a top Clinton
administration official to see watershed restoration projects along
the Tualatin River.
</P>
<P>
   The projects included a restored wetland, a stream once enclosed
inside a pipe that is allowed to return to its natural course, tree
trunks placed in the river and seedlings planted on its banks _ all
done with state money by a coalition of local groups. The aim: to
restore the area drained by the river.
</P>
<P>
   Kitzhaber, in his trademark cowboy boots and leather jacket,
touted the citizen-based progress as a Western model of
``Jeffersonian democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though not ready to go that far, George Frampton, director of
the White House's Council on Environmental Quality, concedes he was
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people got together and did it themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The watershed work is Kitzhaber's favorite example of
``Enlibra,'' a new philosophy that replaces federal orders and
enforcement with voluntary local collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Kitzhaber has promoted the philosophy as a uniquely
Western approach to resolving environmental issues. The name
Enlibra was coined by Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt, drawn from the
Latin words meaning ``in balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea won bipartisan support, and Washington Gov. Gary Locke
has used elements of it.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury is still out on whether it will sweep the West.
Does devolution of power to the local level herald a bright, new
era of cooperative problem solving _ or does it camouflage a
cowardly retreat from enforcement of federal law?
</P>
<P>
   This week, the debate over how to best manage natural resources
was elevated across the Northwest by the listing of several more
salmon in Oregon and Washington for protection under the Endangered
Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The debate comes as Washington, like Oregon, searches for the
right balance between broad, top-down mandates and local, voluntary
action.
</P>
<P>
   Todd True, a Seattle-based attorney for the Earthjustice Legal
Defense Fund, said, ``the opportunities are ahead of us to make a
success, or duck and look for an easy exit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bakke, director of Oregon's Native Fish Society, said
Kitzhaber is ducking a showdown with powerful economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``His coho plan does more to protect the timber industry than it
does to protect the coho,'' Bakke said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Western Governors Association has hailed it as a
promising new approach in a region where people are groping for new
government structures to solve long-standing problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the Puget Sound, Wash., region, the Tri-County Process, an
alliance among Pierce, Snohomish and King counties, is wrestling
with chinook salmon protection that overlaps their boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the Columbia Basin, the Northwest Power Planning Council's
failures have driven people to experiment with the Columbia Forum
process, a collaboration of states, federal agencies and Indian
tribes.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the Enlibra philosophy emerged to fill a vacuum.
Small-government Republicans rule Congress. President Clinton has
declared that the time of big government is over. So who will carry
out the complex reforms needed to preserve fish that permeate most
of the region?
</P>
<P>
   Will Stelle, regional director for the National Marine Fisheries
Service, conceded that his agency lacks local expertise and
personnel to direct salmon habitat improvement on that scale, and
is unlikely to get them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is too systematic a situation for the federal government
to regulate,'' agreed Frampton. ``The feds really can't tell people
what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But the main tools for protecting salmon habitat _ zoning,
building codes, diking, drainage and water systems, logging rules
and the like _ are wielded by states and local governments. Federal
officials say these work better than anything they have to conserve
habitat on private land.
</P>
<P>
   Even if federal shock troops were available and eager for such
jobs, Kitzhaber warns that they would run up against resistance and
thorny property rights claims. Besides, the Oregon governor
believes that a key to salmon recovery is habitat restoration,
which government cannot make people do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relying solely on the (Endangered Species Act) to recover
salmon in Oregon would not only have triggered another divisive
battle, but would ultimately fail to recover salmon,'' Kitzhaber
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, relying instead on voluntary action made a virtue of
necessity. Oregon's GOP-dominated Legislature was in no mood to
slap major new rules on loggers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   So in developing his Oregon Plan for salmon restoration,
Kitzhaber took pains to use the carrot of cooperation and avoid the
state and federal stick. He left the bulk of decisions to local
watershed councils that are selected by county governments. They
typically include landowners, industries, environmentalists,
farmers, and tribal, state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Only by involving and energizing these local people, Kitzhaber
said, can the Northwest get action it needs to restore salmon and
streams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that a new, more collaborative and less
confrontational approach is needed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon doles out $10 million annually to watershed groups to
conduct restoration projects and recommend changes in land-use
practices and even regulation. They have proved wonderful forums to
educate people and mobilize local action.
</P>
<P>
   What remains unclear is how, and when, state or federal
enforcement kicks in if voluntary efforts fail. Kitzhaber has
balked at backing cooperative plans with threats of a state
crackdown. He leaves the bad cop role to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Locke, in contrast, pledges Washington state will step in with
tougher action after three years _ in part to avoid more onerous
restrictions from federal agencies or courts _ if voluntary efforts
and local government reforms fall short.
</P>
<P>
   Locke has accepted the Enlibra principle of involving local
citizens and interest groups, but does not hesitate to ask counties
and regional government groups to develop recovery plans and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also is pumping money into local watershed councils.
But in a departure from local control, Locke has backed a pact
between county, state and federal agencies, some Indian tribes and
the commercial timber industry to impose new, statewide logging
rules _ before input from citizens or local groups.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for watershed councils are mixed. Veteran observers
say the groups lack expertise, a consistent vision of what they
should achieve, and authority to carry it out. They favor
restoration projects, which are politically easier than imposing
regulations, which impose costs on certain people. And without
regulations to prevent further harm, even good restoration work can
be overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, for instance, some watershed councils have dutifully
placed logs in streams to improve salmon habitat even while
timberland owners just upstream have logged almost to the stream
banks, eliminating the source of future stream logs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the value of restoration projects is uncertain. Scientists
have suggested that some may do as much harm as good. They say
prevention of habitat loss is more dependable and less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Kitzhaber also has pledged to write broader water quality plans
and launched collaborative efforts to develop new stream protection
requirements for farmers and timberland owners.
</P>
<P>
   These have yet to bear fruit. Though the timber industry has
pledged $130 million to fix roads that are bleeding sediment into
streams in the Coast Range, it has angrily rejected a costly
federal proposal for new logging restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Where salmon are threatened or endangered, promises won't be
enough to avoid potentially onerous federal restrictions. Last
summer, a federal court made clear that such voluntary efforts and
promises were ``necessarily speculative,'' and not enough to ensure
protection of the coastal coho salmon as the Endangered Species Act
requires. U.S. Magistrate Janice Stewart ordered the coho
protected, and rules to ensure that protection are expected to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Kitzhaber and the federal government initially responded with
outrage, and the governor worried aloud that support for salmon
recovery would evaporate. It didn't, and Kitzhaber and the feds
dropped their appeals and accepted the listing.

   KOSOVO-JOURNALISTS (Seattle) _ As their homeland prepares for
war, two visiting Yugoslavian journalists warned Thursday that
Kosovo's Albanians will suffer the consequences of any NATO
military strike against Serbian targets. ``I think NATO should
seriously consider the consequences of its actions,'' said Dorijan
Nuaj, editor-in-chief of an independent radio station in the Kosovo
capital of Pristina. ``I'd like to ask those NATO generals just
what they think the consequences will be for the Albanians because
they are the ones who are going to suffer the most.''

   SALMON-PROTECTION (Seattle) _ Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber
recently took a top Clinton administration official to see
watershed restoration projects along the Tualatin River. The
projects included a restored wetland, a stream once enclosed inside
a pipe that is allowed to return to its natural course, tree trunks
placed in the river and seedlings planted on its banks _ all done
with state money by a coalition of local groups. The watershed work
is Kitzhaber's favorite example of ``Enlibra,'' a new philosophy
that replaces federal orders and enforcement with voluntary local
collaboration.

   EXXON-SPILL (Cordova, Alaska) _ This fishing village was full of
life and promise 10 years ago, just before the oil tanker Exxon
Valdez went aground on Bligh Reef and dumped 11 million gallons of
crude oil into the pristine waters of Prince William Sound. A
decade after the March 24, 1989, oil spill, the largest in U.S.
history, Prince William Sound appears serene and undisturbed, a
sublime sanctuary. But Cordova, the human epicenter of the spill,
still wears the scars of the spill.

   TV-EARTHLY (Undated) _ Just to get noticed, familiar stories

   FILM-HARMONISTS (Undated) _ If you were fortunate enough to
catch the harrowing 1994 German World War II drama, ``Stalingrad,''
you know that its director, Joseph Vilsmaier, has as strong a feel
for genre and character, and as clear an eye for the epic, as any

   FILM-TRUE-CRIME (Undated) _ Like his last few films,

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Kosovo talks at a dead end, and the
Yugoslav leader more recalcitrant than ever, the Clinton
administration was publicly pushing the threat of airstrikes on
Thursday, but officials said they were counting on avoiding
military action with another week of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's policy of using the threat of NATO
airstrikes to force President Sloboban Milosevic to sign a peace
agreement, has failed so far.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of responding to the threats, Milosevic has moved in the
opposite direction, building up his troops in Kosovo to such an
extent that there are now deep concerns about whether the 1,400
international monitors in Kosovo can leave safely before his troops
trap them by sealing their exit route.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as the administration tries to build up pressure among
its NATO allies for bombing, the U.S. military is warning that
airstrikes will not be so easy. Pentagon officials testified on
Thursday that Yugoslav air defenses are quite sophisticated, that
the terrain in Serbia and over Kosovo is difficult and the weather
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the administration's problems is the visit to
Washington starting next Tuesday of the Russian prime minister,
Yevgeny Primakov, one of the few allies that Milosevic has left and
a staunch opponent of NATO airstrikes against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   If any bombing started before Primakov's visit, which is
intended to help repair the frayed Washington-Moscow relationship,
he would certainly cancel. And senior U.S. officials said that it
would be almost impossible to order bombing while Primakov was
still in the United States. He is not due to leave until next
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On the immediate horizon for the administration is the
well-being of the monitors who work under the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, created by the administration's
special envoy, Richard Holbrooke, as part of a cease-fire agreement
with Milosevic last October.
</P>
<P>
   The administration would like the monitors, who include 170
Americans, evacuated over the weekend, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a dramatic move would send a signal to Milosevic that the
West was getting serious about NATO airstrikes, the administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the OSCE, where the United States is one of 54
members but not a decisive voice, control the evacuation decision.
Further, some European diplomats expressed concern that the
evacuation of the monitors could send the wrong signal to
Milosevic. The Yugoslav leader could well take advantage of the
vacuum by taking stronger military action in Kosovo against the
guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, European diplomats said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, which in the event of a peaceful settlement has
offered 4,000 U.S. troops to the envisioned deployment of 28,000
NATO peacekeepers, expressed its concerns on Thursday about an air
campaign. If airstrikes went ahead, it is envisioned that United
States fighter planes would be among the first to attack, NATO
officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force chief of staff, Gen. Michael Ryan, said that
Yugoslav air defenses are well dug in and that there was the
distinct possibility of losing aircraft. The Marine Corps
Commandant, Gen. Charles Krulak, said that ``it is going to be
tremendously dangerous.'' Krulak told the Senate Armed Services
Committee that there were still ``some bottom-line questions'' that
needed to be answered about air strikes. He listed them as: ``What
is the endgame? How long will the strikes go on? Will our allies
stay with us?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pentagon planners have said that the air defenses of the
Yugoslav military are far superior to those of the Bosnian Serbs,
who were hit four years ago during a NATO air campaign, and indeed
far superior to those of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. On the diplomatic
front, administration officials said they were not necessarily
optimistic about the results of more visits by Western officials to
Milosevic in the coming week but that diplomacy had to be
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not feasible to shut down the peace talks in Paris and
then bomb,'' said one administration official.
</P>
<P>
   There is no consensus among the top administration policy makers
on Kosovo about who should attempt to negotiate with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has no appetite to go,
because there is little guarantee of a positive outcome, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The energy secretary, Bill Richardson, has been mentioned within
administration circles, apparently because the Belgrade regime has
said it would welcome him.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who still faces hearings on his nomination as chief
delegate to the United Nations, had to get special dispensation
from Sen. Jesse Helms to go to Belgrade last week, and the
administration is reluctant to ask for the favor again, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   And as the administration discusses who to send as its envoy,
the Europeans are contemplating sending the co-hosts of the failed
peace talks, the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, and the
British foreign minister, Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a successful outcome of talks with Milosevic
looked slim. When the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer,
offered Milosevic a menu of economic concessions, including the
lifting of trade sanctions, the Yugoslav leader shunted him aside
and went ahead with his troop build-up. Similarly, the Russian
foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, went to Belgrade last weekend and
came away empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov went out of his way on Thursday to urge Milosevic to sign
the political document that was signed by the ethnic Albanians
Thursday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The administration ran into trouble on Capitol Hill Thursday
when Albright and Secretary of Defense William Cohen gave
closed-door briefings to both members of the House and Senate on
their Kosovo policy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who is a supporter of
airstrikes, said that he believed the administration was on the
right course but that President Clinton needed to personally better
explain the policy.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, there was so much dissatisfaction with the
briefings, that a bill offered by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas, giving qualified support to the administration's plan of
deployment of NATO troops will be replaced by another much tougher
measure.
</P>
<P>
   A bill sponsored by Sen. Robert Smith, R-N.H., calling for the
withholding of congressional funds for U.S. troops in Kosovo until
Congress approves the deployment, will replace Ms. Hutchison's
proposal, Senate Republicans said.

RUBIN SAYS LOANS TO RUSSIA MAY HAVE BEEN USED `IMPROPERLY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told a
congressional panel Thursday that he suspected that much of the
$4.8 billion in loans sent to Russia last summer by the
International Monetary Fund ``may have been siphoned off
improperly.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Clinton administration's first public statement
supporting accusations that bailout money simply helped wealthy
Russian oligarchs move billions of dollars to Switzerland and other
safe havens.
</P>
<P>
   Financial regulators note that a huge flow of dollars left
Russia immediately after the monetary fund's cash was delivered to
the Russian central bank, suggesting investors were getting out
before the ruble was permitted to collapse on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Rubin's comments was particularly significant
because Russia's prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, arrives here in
five days on a mission to obtain the next installment of $22
billion in loans. It is unclear whether he will succeed, though
there is growing pressure on the IMF to lend Russia just enough
money to allow it to pay back several billion dollars that it owes
to the fund in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has been publicly pushing the move, which amounts to
accounting sleight-of-hand, for two months now, chiefly because it
would keep Russia from formal default.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin suggested Thursday that, despite endemic corruption and
Primakov's seeming inability to put together an economic plan, the
United States still had an interest in financially aiding the
country. The United States has the largest block of votes within
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Russia destabilizes, the costs to the United States are
going to be vastly greater than anything we can think of,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   After his testimony before a House appropriations subcommittee,
Rubin once again deflected reports that he might be planning to
resign. Such reports have sprung up repeatedly in recent years and
resurfaced after the conclusion of President Clinton's impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The relative calm in the world economy has contributed to the
revival of the rumors. And this week, the Treasury Department
announced that Rubin would not be attending an annual meeting of
Asian finance ministers in May, and would send his deputy, Lawrence
Summers, instead. The department said the meeting conflicted with
Rubin's commitments to make several commencement addresses.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation Thursday after his appearance before the House
panel, Rubin qualified his testimony by saying that ``it may have
been careless to use the word `improper''' because ``there is
nothing improper about moving money out of Russia or any other
country.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the capital flight may have helped buy
time for a group of Russia's wealthiest and most powerful business
executives _ who suspected the government would soon devalue the
ruble, and wanted to get their rubles converted into dollars
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the fund, along with some funds from the World
Bank, went to the Russian central bank. And the bank spent it to
intervene in the markets and buy rubles for several weeks. Some
money may also have been provided to banks, giving their clients
access to dollars in return for ruble deposits. The result was that
the $4.8 billion was quickly drained away, and a similar amount
appeared in overseas bank accounts. This could have been avoided
only with capital controls, rules that prevent taking money out of
the country, which the United States has rarely supported in recent
years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Money is fungible,'' said Rubin, ``so it is hard to say
exactly what happened to it. I can't tell you exactly what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The bitter experience of last July, though, has left the IMF
wary about making a second installment of the loan to Primakov's
government. Some fear that giving Russia more money than it
currently owes would invite a repetition of the capital flight.
Moreover, Russia has made scant progress on economic reforms that
the fund could seize upon as a reason for new loans.
</P>
<P>
   The budget Russia adopted recently is considered largely
unrealistic by both American officials and the fund itself. There
has been little progress on tax collection in Russia, the IMF says,
and just the other day the Russian Parliament cut a value-added
tax, angering fund officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are also angry. They argue that the fund's
conditions are far too stringent and will contribute to the
country's recession. The fund's managing director, Michel
Camdessus, engaged in an unusual public exchange with Primakov's
aides several weeks ago, and another top IMF official told the
Trilateral Commission here this weekend that Russia's government is
so weak that its economic commitments cannot be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, while more elliptical, made a similar point Thursday in
his testimony. ``If Russia is going to have a successful economy,
there are going to have to be a whole host of reforms that provide
the framework for a market economy,'' Rubin told the House
subcommittee.

TOURISM MAKING MODEST INROADS IN CORDOVA

<P>
   CORDOVA, Alaska _ With his headband, long, curly hair and
cocksure manner, Kevin Quinn looks like someone more comfortable on
the ski slopes at Whistler in British Columbia or Big Sky in
Montana than in a Prince William Sound salmon cannery.
</P>
<P>
   But Quinn, president of Points North Heli-Adventures, has taken
over an abandoned cannery bunkhouse and is opening remote reaches
of the Chugach Mountains to what he calls some of the world's best
spring skiing.
</P>
<P>
   He is making quite a few friends these days because he is
investing in this fishing town that has been hit by economic
calamity since the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bringing a new venue to Cordova,'' said Quinn, pointing
to the vast wild reaches of the Scott and Sheridan glaciers behind
Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the town's most ardent environmentalists are
blessing the venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's non-extractive; they've done their best to fit into this
community,'' said Kelly Weaverling, a bookstore owner who made
history here by being the first mayor in the United States elected
on the Green Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Other Southeast Alaska coastal communities have been transformed
into tourist havens. Juneau, the capital, plays host to more than
500,000 cruise-ship passengers each spring and summer. With its
colorful, bawdy history of the Klondike gold rush, Skagway draws
7,000 summer visitors a day, mostly off cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova remains a fishing village to the core. Nonetheless, it
draws about 10,000 visitors a year but is wary of being overrun by
more.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,500 tourists stopped in Cordova on cruise ships last
summer. They arrived twice a week on a schedule that locals could
tolerate. The visitors spent about $400,000, touring the Childs
Glacier and taking in the region's natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, some tour operators keep guests almost hermetically
sealed off in company-owned ships, hotels, railroad cars and even
buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industrial tourism doesn't leave money,'' said David Grimes,
who runs a rafting-outdoor adventure company.
</P>
<P>
   Wilderness and nature-based tourism seems more welcome in
Cordova than a daily dose of cruise-ship passengers. A shorebird
festival each May has begun to draw ornithologists to see one of
the world's great concentrations of migratory birds. The Chugach
National Forest has fly-in cabins for rent.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, however, the picturesque, hard-working fishing
community has not marketed itself as a tourism destination.
</P>
<P>
   Points North Heli-Adventures Inc. could change that. Quinn is
touting ``adventures beyond dreams'' for skiers and promises a
summer operation that will airlift hikers to glaciers and
mountaintops.
</P>
<P>
   Will it work? Quinn needs Cordova, as much as or more than
Cordova needs him.
</P>
<P>
   Huge glaciers are fed by huge storms. On days when flying is
impossible, the helicopter adventure company will need to take its
guests sea kayaking, fishing or to the Mount Eyak ski area above
town.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there have been grumbles about showoff, hot-dog skiing
by Points North guides at Mount Eyak, which is equipped with a
rebuilt, 1930s-vintage chair lift that once carried Clark Gable up
the slopes of Sun Valley, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Until fishing recovers, if it recovers, tourism is about the
only way Cordova can grow. The locals vow to keep it under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cordova will always be a fishing town,'' said Dune Lankard, an
Eyak native and fisherman turned conservationist. ``Why make it a
metropolis? If you like Skagway or Juneau, move there.''

STUDY CONTRASTS NEW AND OLD DRUGS USED TO TREAT DEPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new government report on antidepressants offers some
conclusions that may surprise Prozac Nation, even if they are no
surprise to researchers: Prozac and other drugs of its generation
are not any better _ or any worse _ than older compounds in
treating major depression.
</P>
<P>
   The report also sounded a note of caution for physicians who
prescribe new antidepressants for children, and for patients who
are only mildly depressed: There has not been enough research to
establish whether the drugs are effective in either case.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists who specialize in treating depression said the
report, by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, would help put to
rest claims that the new drugs make older antidepressants obsolete,
and the skepticism of those who insist that older drugs remain the
``gold standard'' for treating severe depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of those extremes is accurate,'' said Dr. Matthew
Rudorfer, acting associate director for treatment research at the
National Institute of Mental Health, who is familiar with the
report. ``The importance of this report is that when one actually
looks at the scientific data, it's clear that in the effective
treatment of depression, one has many options, all of which work.
What can make the difference, therefore, is how well matched a
given individual with depression is with a given treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, which examined 32 drugs, including three herbal
treatments, was based on a review and analysis of hundreds of
clinical studies and reports of adverse drug effects. Using a
statistical technique called meta-analysis, the researchers were
able to draw conclusions more sweeping than any individual research
project could.
</P>
<P>
   All the newer drugs, the researchers found, were more effective
in alleviating major depression in adults than placebo treatments.
Fifty percent of severely depressed patients improved significantly
on the antidepressants, compared with 32 percent of those given
dummy pills. And the drugs performed just as well as tricyclics,
the older class of antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of long-term studies, the report said, showed that
newer antidepressants also are effective in preventing relapse in
patients who have recovered from an episode of depression.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely known new antidepressants are the SSRIs, or
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, like Prozac. But the new
generation of drugs also includes drugs like Effexor, Wellbutrin
and Serzone, which have different effects on chemicals in the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   The newer antidepressants do have some advantages over older
medicines, said Dr. John W. Williams Jr., an associate professor of
medicine at the South Texas Veterans Healthcare System in San
Antonio, and a co-author of the report. While both new and old
drugs have side effects, patients taking newer antidepressants on
the whole appear to find the side effects more tolerable, and are
less likely to stop taking the medicines because of them, Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, compared with patients taking tricyclic antidepressants,
the report found, patients on the newer drugs are more likely to
experience diarrhea, nausea, insomnia and headache. Sexual
dysfunction is a familiar complaint of patients taking SSRIs, but
only a small percentage of studies reviewed in the report mentioned
the side effect, and the report's authors concluded that it was
``reported too infrequently for reliable interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tricyclics, the report noted, are more likely than newer drugs
to produce dry mouth, dizziness, blurred vision and tremors.
</P>
<P>
   SSRIs are also significantly less lethal than tricyclic
antidepressants, making them safer for depressed patients, who can
run a high risk of suicide. ``There appears to be less of a risk of
completed suicide with overdose,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And the newer drugs, which have a simpler dosing system and do
not require periodic blood tests to monitor drug levels, are easier
for general practitioners as well as psychiatrists to prescribe. A
large proportion of prescriptions for the drugs is written by
general practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   Still, older drugs may be a better ``match'' for some patients
because the side effects of any antidepressant vary from person to
person. Some side effects may be less of a problem for some
patients than for others: A drug that has sedation as a side
effect, for example, may actually help a depressed patient who is
having trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   New antidepressants, in particular SSRIs, are often prescribed
by physicians for mild or minor depression, Williams said, though
there are no good estimates of how frequently this occurs.
Nevertheless, the report's authors could find very few well
designed, controlled studies examining the effectiveness of
antidepressants in minor depression, though some SSRIs appeared in
some studies to effectively treat ``dysthymia,'' or chronic
low-level depression that may last for years.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the report found that there are few conclusive
studies of newer antidepressants in very young patients, leading
the authors to conclude in their executive summary of the report
that ``data are insufficient to guide management of depression in
children and adolescents.''
</P>
<P>
   Three herbal treatments _ kava kava, valeriana, and St. John's
wort _ received mixed reviews in the report. The authors found no
controlled studies, and thus no evidence, for the effectiveness of
either kava kava or valeriana. Several European studies, however,
have found St. John's wort to be more effective in treating
depression than placebos.
</P>
<P>
   Because patients in those studies suffered from different types
of depression, however, and because the quality and strength of
European preparations of St. Johns wort differs from those
available in the United States, the report's authors resisted
coming to firm conclusions about the herbal medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Kupfer, chairman of psychiatry at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine and an expert on the treatment of
depression, said that though the new generation of antidepressants
is now being viewed with more perspective, the fact that new drugs
are still arriving on the market is in itself encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the pharmaceutical companies continue to target their new
compounds,'' he said, ``it increases the recognition of depression,
increases the likelihood that people are going to get treated and
decreases the stigma.''

COPPER RIVER AN ECONOMIC LIFELINE FOR CORDOVA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 30 miles east of Cordova, the Copper River is a notorious
funnel of high winds from the state's interior matched only by the
ferocity of incoming storms off the Gulf of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys go home; the men stay around,'' said Robby Maxwell,
who makes fishing nets in the winter and navigates the Copper
River's shallows each spring.
</P>
<P>
   The mouth of the Copper River is the centerpiece to a
700,000-acre wetland that is the largest on the continent. ``The
Copper River Delta is the crown jewel of North America's
wetlands,'' marine biologist and gillnetter Dr. Riki Ott wrote in
her recent book ``Alaska's Copper River Delta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in Grays Harbor (Wash.), you see about 1 million
migrating shorebirds each year. We get 12 million of the same
species. It is the key spring staging area along the Pacific coast
of North and South America,'' said Pete Mikkelson, a retired
University of Alaska waterfowl biologist who runs an educational
retreat called Alaska Wild Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting the Copper River from industrial development has
become almost an obsession with fishermen and other residents of
Cordova. The Copper also has been championed by national
conservation groups, which are campaigning for a public purchase of
mineral and logging rights on native-owned land east of the river.
</P>
<P>
   From 1911 to 1938, the Copper River was the scene of major
development. The Copper River and Northwestern Railway was built to
carry copper ore from the upstream Kennecott mines to Cordova on
the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Copper River Delta today is protected as part of the
Chugach National Forest or as state critical wildlife habitat. But
since the copper mine closed 60 years ago, development proposals
have never died. They include:
</P>
<P>
   __The road: In the early 1990s, using ``highway maintenance''
money, Republican Gov. Wally Hickel started to bulldoze a road down
the old railroad bed. It would have linked Cordova to the
Anchorage-Valdez highway and the rest of the state. Opponents
feared the road would bring hundreds of sport fishermen to compete
for salmon with the town's commercial fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   But Cordova is not equipped to handle any influx of sightseers
and day-trippers. ``We have only one public bathroom,'' said Dune
Lankard, an Eyak native and outspoken conservationist.
</P>
<P>
   The road project was halted in court by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, which found more than 100 violations of federal
environmental and wetlands laws. But boosters still want it built.
</P>
<P>
   __The trail: Current Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat, wants
to create a recreation trail from tiny Chitina through the Copper
River wilderness and on to Cordova. Flanked by the Chugach Mountain
Range, running close to the snouts of great glaciers, the project
is being touted as North America's equivalent of the legendary
Milford Trek in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a destination point in and of itself for people who
want to see some of the world's most spectacular scenery,'' Knowles
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The project has its critics. ``There already is a world-class
trail: It is the Copper River,'' said David Grimes, who runs a
rafting company called Br'er Rabbit World Wide Escapades, Larks and
Adventures.
</P>
<P>
   __The logging project: The Chugach Alaska Corp., a native-owned
corporation set up under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act,
has proposed a 60-mile logging road from the river's delta to reach
mineral rights and 8,000 acres of old-growth forest it owns east of
the Copper River. The road would cross at least 100 salmon-spawning
streams.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, tried but failed last year to get
congressional approval to fund the road traversing national forest
lands.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are pressing Chugach Alaska to agree on a
conservation easement, which would let the native corporation keep
title to the land but sell all development rights, possibly to the
federal government, effectively precluding logging.
</P>
<P>
   The National Wildlife Federation argues that money from Exxon's
$900 million oil spill settlement should be used to buy up the
development rights. The proposed road and logging are about 70
miles east of Prince William Sound. A state-federal trustee council
has used settlement money to preserve about 650,000 acres of
sensitive habitat in the area of the spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the bird and mammal populations we are trying to
nurse back to health in Prince William Sound also rely on the
Copper River Delta,'' said Tony Turrini, Alaska director of the
National Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   A major conference on the future of the Copper River Delta,
sponsored by the U.S. Forest Service, will be held in Cordova early
in May.

STEAM PLANT STILL STANDING BETWEEN PATRIOTS, STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ It all boils down to... a steam plant.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by criticism that it is holding out for an unreasonable
price, the steam plant company distributed copies of its property
assessment as proof it needs about $48 million to cover the costs
of relocating its Hartford headquarters to make way for a new
stadium for the New England Patriots stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But local business leaders, though eager to bring the team here,
said they were willing to contribute no more than $25 million to
move the offices of CTG Resources Inc.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of terse recriminations between Connecticut
Governor John G. Rowland and CTG's chief executive, Arthur
Marquardt, the two sides were no closer to bridging the funding gap
_ or to resolving a related dispute over terms of moving the steam
plant itself. Failure to do so could kill the stadium deal.
</P>
<P>
   While that prospect has caught the attention of Massachusetts
political leaders, key players in last year's efforts to keep the
team in Foxborough said that for now they were watching from the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Marquardt, at press conference in the company's nondescript
concrete offices, suggested his shareholders would not pay the
difference. And Robert Kraft, owner of the Patriots, doesn't want
to pay for it either, according to people close to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence other businesses stepping up with money, that
would leave Nutneg State taxpayers, many of whom are unhappy that
public money would finance construction of the $374 million stadium
along the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not be asked,'' said Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani.
``The governor has made clear there's no more state money to be put
on the table; $374 million is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   That money was approved by the General Assembly in December to
build the Patriots a new home. But in the rush to get the deal
done, Rowland did not set aside specific funds to relocate CTG's
building. And agreement on a plan to cover the estimated cost of
$47 million to $60 million to move the steam plant, which sits on
the 50 yard line of the proposed stadium, is being held up by what
Rowland has called unreasonable demands by CTG.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are being further strained by an April 2
deadline by which the state must prove three things to Kraft: That
the steam plant can be moved in time for stadium construction to
begin by the summer of 2000; that the team will not be liable for
an environmental damage on the site; and that there is ample
funding and planning to allow parking lots around the football
field to empty in one hour after games.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly wary of the timeframe, officials have been trying
to downplay that deadline in recent days. According to the
agreement between the team and the state, there is a 30-day window
beyond April 2 for Kraft to decide if he wants to continue pursuing
a Hartford stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots spokesman had no comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Boston, spokeswomen for Governor Paul Cellucci and
Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham said the leaders were closely
watching events in Hartford, but could do little other than refile
bills that died last year offering up to $72 million in land and
infrastructure aid for the team to rebuild in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   And House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, whose fierce opposition to
public funding for a stadium prevented a deal in the team's home
state, remained immutable Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sense that there has been any shift at all,'' Finneran
told the Globe. ``The Senate bill was dreadful in the view of most
members and it set us on a path that could not be sustained or
justified. The precedents attached to that one were staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran has refiled his own bill, offering $57 million,
strictly for improvements to infrastructure along Route 1 in
Foxborough even though Kraft said that legislation was not enough
to keep the team in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran's political foil, Rowland, may be paying a price for
his enthusiasm to lure the Patriots to Hartford as part of a $1
billion urban revitalization project.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a soft spoken Marquardt, standing next to a panel of
architects and construction experts who valued the office
relocation at $48 million, said he was surprised the state was only
now scrambling to cover the expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a project like this to work, you have to do the
due diligence, do your homework, and make sure you have a funding
mechanism. That was evidently not done and it's not the fault of
the people who happen to be working here,'' Marquardt said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Rowland publicly blasted Marquardt for not being a
good corporate citizen and for upping the price on a prized piece
of property, despite agreeing to move well before the Patriots
signed the Hartford deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the animosity between the governor and the steam plant
executive has gotten personal, according to those familiar with the
talks.

DOW CROSSES 10,000 AGAIN, THEN SLIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They huffed and they puffed, but U.S. stock traders
still couldn't push the Dow Jones industrial average to close above
10,000 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of a flurry of late buying, which propelled the average
to 10,001.50 just minutes before trading ended, the Dow finished at
9,997.62, an increase of 118.21 points. The rally, which took the
average to a new closing high, added 1.2 percent to its value.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index also closed at a new high
Thursday, rising 18.73 points to 1,316.55, an increase of 1.44
percent. The Nasdaq composite index also had a good session, rising
33.99 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,462.96, though it remains short
of the high of 2,510.09 it set on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of good news Thursday to make traders
ebullient. The Consumer Price Index stayed dormant in February,
rising one-tenth of 1 percent on falling prices for apparel and
fuel oil. And the report that third-quarter earnings by FDX Corp.,
the parent of Federal Express, more than quadrupled those of the
same period a year earlier, heartened investors worried that stock
valuations are outpacing earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the recent spike in oil prices and rising bond yields
concern some investors. ``Maybe the reason we're having such a hard
time breaking through this magic number is we're having real
powerful conflicting forces,'' said Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equity
strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities. ``On the plus side, the
earnings news is getting better. Over the long term that drives
stock prices. But the upward drift in bond yields is the bad
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the late move in stocks came from two unlikely quarters:
tobacco stocks and options traders.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 3 p.m., it was reported that a federal jury in Akron,
Ohio, had concluded that tobacco companies were not liable for $2
billion in damages sought by union health and benefit plans in that
state for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Philip Morris Cos., the third-biggest mover in the
Dow, rose 3 3/4, to 42. Those of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., parent
of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, gained 1 11/16 to close at 30 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Another push for stocks came from traders who had bet against
the S&AMP;P's rising and then had to buy back the S&AMP;P options they had
previously sold.
</P>
<P>
   This buying was particularly strong at the end of the session
because March-dated options expired Thursday. If the traders had
not covered their positions, they would have been extremely
vulnerable to even higher stock prices Friday. But they waited
until the last possible moment to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that the buying couldn't prop the Dow average
beyond 10,000 again shows that there are many traders eager to sell
stock when the milestone is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The psychological barrier is going to be real at 10,000
because every investor in a Dow portfolio has a profit,'' Alan
Kral, portfolio manager at Trevor, Stewart, Burton &AMP; Jacobsen in
New York, said. ``Until those people who are triggered to act by
the number 10,000 are done, there will be volatility here.''

SENATE COMMITTEE PASSES GOP BUDGET; MEDICARE STILL A STICKING
POINT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Okla., S.D.)   (rk) 
 By   RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Budget Committee approved the Republican
tax and spending plan Thursday as the Clinton administration and
congressional Democrats stepped up their attacks on the measure and
labeled it irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   The committee sent the fiscal blueprint to the full Senate on a
11-to-9 vote along party lines after three days of debate. Both the
House and the Senate will vote on the plan next week, and unlike
last year, when the Republican Party was split over how hard to
push for tax cuts, Republicans appear united and all but certain to
adopt the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for setting aside $1.8 trillion of the projected
$2.6 trillion surplus over the next decade for Social Security and
using the rest for tax cuts. It would increase spending for the
military and for education, but would require cuts in a array of
other programs to remain within spending limits established in the
1997 bipartisan budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., who is chairman of the budget
committee, said the priorities set out in the bill were ``very,
very good'' and would allow Congress to do a better job of
addressing the nation's long-term problems than would the
Democratic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the Republican plan risked a return to deficits
by committing the country to sweeping tax cuts before the surpluses
actually materialized. They also denounced it for failing to set
aside any money explicitly for Medicare, the health insurance
system for the elderly, which faces insolvency in about a decade as
the population ages and medical costs increase.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore took the lead in attacking the plan
Thursday, saying it would work no better than Reagan administration
budgets in the early 1980s that promised tax cuts and increased
Pentagon spending but that led to huge deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried this kind of budget before and it nearly wrecked
the United States,'' Gore told a group of black newspaper
publishers at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pours hundreds of billions of dollars into open-ended,
extremely risky tax schemes, just sort of like a roulette table,''
Gore said. ``And that means the cupboard is bare when it comes to
saving Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans struck back by accusing Democrats of playing
politics with Medicare and blocking bipartisan efforts to put the
system on sounder financial footing. They said the key to
preserving Medicare in the long run was overhauling the system to
reduce costs. Also, Republicans said their budget would do more
than the president's to wall off Social Security's money and reduce
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan calls for $350 billion to be set aside for
Medicare over the next decade, and $1.33 trillion to be set aside
for Social Security. The Republican plan, while setting aside $1.8
trillion for Social Security over the same period, does not earmark
any specific funds for Medicare other than $133 billion in the
Senate version that could be used for a variety of contingencies,
including Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find efforts by House Democrats to manipulate and frighten
older Americans by deliberately mischaracterizing our
accomplishments in the name of politics and demagoguery to be
deeply disappointing,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the
chairman of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats hammered away at their theme that the tax cuts
would come at the expense of Medicare and other domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can provide ever-growing tax breaks at the expense of
Medicare, our domestic priorities and debt reduction,'' said Sen.
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader in the Senate.
``Or we can invest today to guarantee our health and retirement
security, pay down the debt, educate the next generation and make
our future more secure.''

   CORDOVA, Alaska _ This fishing village was full of life and
promise 10 years ago, just before the oil tanker Exxon Valdez went
aground on Bligh Reef and dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil
into the pristine waters of Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Robby Maxwell was finishing a winter's work assembling 60
fishing nets that would sell for as much as $30,000 apiece. Bill
Webber and his 10 employees had spent a busy off-season building a
half-dozen fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   A harbor filled with fishing boats buzzed with talk of the April
herring season. The pink salmon were expected in unsurpassed
numbers; their return would follow record-high salmon prices the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The herring fishery was a bellwether: If I had a good season,
my bills were paid for the year,'' said Phil Lian. Ten years ago,
Lian owned a net-supply company, a bar and restaurant, a high-tech
seine fishing boat, a time-share condo in Hawaii, plus four coveted
permits to fish for herring and salmon in Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Then disaster struck Alaska's south-central coast.
</P>
<P>
   A DECADE AFTER the March 24, 1989, oil spill, the largest in
U.S. history, Prince William Sound appears serene and undisturbed,
a sublime sanctuary. Sea otters frolic. Bald eagles present an
all-seeing presence atop tree snags. Seals and their pups lounge on
icebergs calved by tidewater glaciers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the worst-case places, the oil is rapidly going away
and is not threatening anything,'' Dr. David Page, a Bowdoin
College scientist hired by Exxon Corp. to conduct studies, told the
recent 1999 International Oil Spill Conference in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But Cordova, the human epicenter of the spill, still wears the
scars of the spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what you did!'' is written on a child's drawing of a
tanker dripping oil, pasted in a downtown window.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen and townsfolk, many of whom cashed in on an overnight
bonanza in trying to contain the oil spill, are paying the price of
declining fish harvests. Native Alaskans have seen their
subsistence lifestyle ebb with the declining herring runs and have
been pushed awkwardly into a cash economy.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs who won $5 billion from Exxon are waiting for their
first payments while the jury award sits in the bank, drawing
interest for Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, the tanker's skipper who was convicted
of negligently discharging oil, will be picking up trash on Alaska
state lands this summer as part of his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon has recovered, making billions of dollars in profits and
planning a merger with Mobil Oil. The merger would create, in total
assets, the largest corporation on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Exxon stresses the lessons learned: how to clean up an
oil spill, and how to ship oil more safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all realize that oil spillage has dropped substantially in
the last 10 years,'' said Al Maki, an environmental adviser to
Exxon USA. He acknowledged at an oil spill forum earlier this
month, however, that ``in spite of man's best efforts, accidents
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the company's claims of nearly complete recovery, a
child's sandbox trowel will uncover oil-soaked sand at Sleepy Bay
on Latouche Island or at several places on Knight Island, across
Prince William Sound from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is damage here that is irreparable. Period. No matter
how many pictures you see of Prince William Sound in all its
beauty, it's not the same beneath the surface,'' said Jack Reilly,
a Cordova fisherman who holds down three jobs to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Mark King owned one of four Cordova fishing boats that
tried to keep a boom around the grounded Exxon Valdez as an Easter
Sunday storm caused the oil to escape and spread.
</P>
<P>
   King, whose family has pulled a livelihood from the sea for 62
years, signed cleanup contract No. 001 with Exxon and was later
paid what he calls ``a phenomenal amount of money'' to work on the
cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   In a state that has seen the fur trade, gold rushes and oil
booms, Cordova saw a lot of money coming in during that summer 10
years ago. Contractors, fishermen, merchants, innkeepers, residents
and outsiders cashed in on an oil spill recovery effort that
ultimately cost Exxon more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The overnight bonanza spawned acid news reports about the
``spillionaires'' of Cordova. But it was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Many fishermen, flush with cash, bought new boats and equipment,
and found themselves badly overextended as fish runs failed and
fish prices plummeted. Merchants had a bonanza year during the '89
cleanup ``but it was the last good year,'' said Marv Vandenbroek at
the local hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   Lian now estimates his assets _ if he could liquidate them _ at
perhaps one-tenth of his $3 million net worth in 1989. Gone are the
restaurant and bar, the net supply store, the Hawaii condo and the
purse seiner.
</P>
<P>
   Webber Marine &AMP; Manufacturing Inc. has built just six boats in
the past 10 years. At Redden Nets, Maxwell has made only eight nets
this past winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been able to put one dollar into an IRA for my
retirement, not one dollar into a fund for my children's
education,'' Maxwell said. ``It scares the hell out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost more than half our processing capacity, and never
regained it,'' said Linden O'Toole, who with her husband paid
$300,000 for a seine-fishing permit before the spill. The couple
later sold it for $48,000. The once-coveted permit, they say, is
now worth perhaps $25,000 if a buyer could be found for it.
</P>
<P>
   THE PINK SALMON fishery in Prince William Sound collapsed in
1992 and 1993, possibly because exposure to oil damaged
reproduction. Hatchery-spawned pinks have since come back, but wild
salmon are recovering more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too soon to say we are totally out of the woods,'' said
Ken Roemhildt, superintendent of North Pacific Processors' cannery
in Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   But once-reliable markets have been lost to farmed salmon, and
canneries have closed. Salmon prices went as high as $2.70 a pound
during the late 1980s, but have fallen to one-fourth that level.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can catch fish, but you can't sell the fish,'' said Ross
Mullins, a veteran Cordova fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific herring fishery also fell in 1994. The decline may
be caused by disease, or possibly by lingering effects from the
spill. Herring recently were classified as a ``recovering'' species
by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, the state-federal
body monitoring sea life in the Sound. But last year's run is a
fraction what it was a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've fished for herring once since 1993,'' said Mark King.
</P>
<P>
   A fisherman's retirement fund usually comes from the sale of his
or her assets. In Cordova, however, the price of seine boats and
permits has fallen with the fishery. King sold his seiner last
winter, receiving $70,000 for a boat he had bought for $175,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people went from being vibrant small-businessmen to
depressed small-businessmen,'' said Brian O'Neill, a
Minneapolis-based attorney who represented 40,000 commercial
fishermen and other parties in a class-action suit against Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, an Anchorage jury found Exxon had acted recklessly and
awarded damages of $5 billion, most of it to commercial and native
Alaskan fishermen, in the second-largest jury verdict in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs have yet to see a penny of the money. Exxon has
filed a multiplicity of appeals over the past five years. The case
is to be heard by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   In appealing the jury award, Exxon was ordered to post a bank
letter of credit assuring it could pay out the $5 billion. Interest
of 5.9 percent is accruing on the award. Plaintiffs and their
attorneys say the oil company can realize more than twice as much
interest by investing the money and believe Exxon is using the
delay to pay itself off.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O'Neill has watched his clients move away, go
bankrupt, endure divorces and die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were going to make us whole, not put us in a
hole,'' said O'Toole, the seiner.
</P>
<P>
   CORDOVA HAS ENDURED more ups and downs than most communities of
2,500 residents.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the downtown business district burned to the
ground in 1963. A year later, the massive Good Friday earthquake
wiped out nearby shellfish beds. Enormous storms tearing in from
the Gulf of Alaska have killed fishermen in treacherous waters of
the Copper River Delta, about 30 miles east of here.
</P>
<P>
   When natural disasters have struck, said former Cordova Mayor
Margy Johnson, the community has bonded, wrapping itself in a
we-shall-overcome attitude, and quickly gotten back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever sued God,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The man-made disaster of the Exxon Valdez spill is another
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Its effects have unfolded year after year. And the marathon
legal battle against Exxon has, in Johnson's words, ``exhausted''
Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key point is that after the fire and earthquake, we could
go out and make a living. The Sound was still whole,'' said Roxy
Estes, a lifelong Cordovan.
</P>
<P>
   Cordovans are bitter over what they say are broken promises from
Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   At the office of Cordova District Fishermen United _ a fisheries
lobby group that fought construction of the trans-Alaska pipeline
in the 1970s, fearing an oil spill in the Sound _ a quartet of
veteran fishermen put up a banner during a snowstorm early this
month. It read:
</P>
<P>
   ``Exxon 10 Years Later
</P>
<P>
   No Payment
</P>
<P>
   No Punishment
</P>
<P>
   No Prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks we're going to get rich (from the Exxon
lawsuit), but a lot of people will divide that money,'' said Virgil
Carroll, a Wyoming native who came up to Alaska to serve in the
Coast Guard, and stayed to fish out of Cordova for 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll reared three sons in Cordova. All of them once fished.
In recent years, as the fishery declined, they have moved to the
lower 48 to pursue graduate degrees and livelihoods that don't
depend on the sea.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 52 other spills around the world have released far
more oil than the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. The tanker Aegean
Sea spilled 23.8 million gallons off the coast of Spain in 1992; a
year later, the tanker Maersk Navigator spilled 78 million gallons
off Indonesia; and the Brer sent 26 million gallons into waters off
the Shetland Islands on the north coast of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, hitting where it did, this is the most damaging oil spill
in history in terms of biological, social and environmental damage.
... It did extraordinary damage, long-lasting damage that has
persisted 10 years later,'' said Rick Steiner of the University of
Alaska's marine advisory program.
</P>
<P>
   THE EXXON VALDEZ went aground in a 30-by-75 mile bay in which a
salmon fishery _ decimated in the 1950s by overfishing _ had been
restored through conservation and hatchery construction to produce
millions of fish.
</P>
<P>
   And the oil was loosed upon a stormy coastline where containment
was impossible even if the Alyeska Pipeline Co. had been able to
get cleanup equipment quickly onto the spill.
</P>
<P>
   The spill spread out of Prince William Sound down a
470-mile-long southwesterly trajectory, oiling a thousand miles of
inlets, islets and outcroppings on the Kenai Peninsula and Kodiak
Island, and extending down the Alaska Peninsula to such sanctuaries
as Katmai National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from the spill has been estimated by the trustee
council at more than 260,000 seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor
seals, 250 bald eagles and up to 22 killer whales. Billions of
salmon and herring larvae may also have been casualties of the
spill.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a scientific paper from the National Marine
Fisheries Service's Auke Bay Laboratory in Juneau was presented at
an American Fisheries Society conference. The research found that
very low-level contamination by oil affected salmon embryos and cut
the return rate of adults to their spawning site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means oil is toxic at much lower levels than previously
thought, and that problems with fish are intergenerational,'' said
Dr. Riki Ott, a Cordova-based marine biologist, gillnetter and
former executive director of the Copper River Watershed Project.
</P>
<P>
   THE OIL SPILL was toxic in other ways. The decline in the
herring fishery has hit native Alaskan villages along Prince
William Sound particularly hard. Herring roe is a major part of the
native subsistence diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sound was our supermarket,'' said Patience Anderson
Faulkner, an ebullient woman who works at the Eyak tribal village
and is a member of a regional citizen advisory committee created by
Congress as a watchdog on oil tanker operations.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner jokes that she had to ``learn to be an Alaska native
the last 22 years'' after spending much of her earlier life as a
military wife in the lower 48. The best parts of the learning were
traditional foods such as herring roe and kelp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last batch I received about four years ago from a cousin
in Tatitlek,'' she said. ``It looked good. It came from an area
that the scientists said had been cleaned up of oil. It sure didn't
taste good.''
</P>
<P>
   The native village of Chenega, once destroyed by the 1964
earthquake, lay in the path of the spill. The Exxon Valdez disaster
has cost Chenega two-thirds of its people. Oiled waters poisoned
clam beds and no longer yielded a bounty of food. Much of Chenega's
native-owned land was bought by the trustee council.
</P>
<P>
   It was isolated, ``but there was a lot of food,'' said Avis
Kompkoff, who grew up in the village. ``Now you have to go far away
to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   As they gathered for morning coffee at the net shop last week,
Cordova fishermen remembered the night of March 28, 1989, four days
after the tanker hit Bligh Reef. They heard Exxon executive Don
Cornett deliver sweeping reassurances and expansive promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do business straight,'' Cornett told them. ``If you can
show that you have a loss as a result of this spill, we will
compensate it. ... We will consider whatever it takes to make you
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon executive's words are angrily quoted a decade later by
people whose lives have been fractured.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied to us!'' said Robby Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   A more reflective Bill Webber added: ``Society should demand
accountability. And that is all we are asking for. They have the
money to play games with us. At long last, after 10 years, they
should at least pay for what they did to us.''

 &HT;    RailWatch comes under fire
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the nonprofit group RailWatch was launched this
winter, it claimed support from ``more than 300 public officials''
concerned about rail safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   At a Washington news conference in February, the group issued a
report titled ``Why is there a train accident every 90 minutes?''
It demanded action by Congress, which holds hearings on rail issues
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the public officials, including at least two in
Georgia, say they had no idea they were joining RailWatch when they
left their names at a convention booth in Kansas City, Mo., last
year.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the group has a quiet corporate backer: United
Parcel Service, the Atlanta-based shipping giant, which is both a
rail customer and competitor.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, RailWatch has drawn as much attention to its own
tactics and motives _ and to the way special interest lobbying
sometimes works _ as to legitimate concerns about rail safety.
</P>
<P>
   UPS, working with a California public relations firm, helped
start RailWatch and provides financial support, spokesman Norman
Black confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither RailWatch nor UPS would reveal the extent of the
company's backing. But Ken Churchill, UPS vice president for public
affairs, is the only corporate representative on the group's board
of directors.
</P>
<P>
   UPS didn't participate in RailWatch's kickoff and isn't
mentioned in an ``About RailWatch'' section on its Internet site.
After media inquiries about the group's origins, however, the
section was reworded to add unnamed ``shippers from around the
country'' as backers.
</P>
<P>
   Black said UPS hasn't tried to hide its support but isn't
involved in how RailWatch is presented, despite having a seat on
its board and helping fund its activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not defensive in any way about our support of
RailWatch,'' Black said. On the other hand, he said, ``It's not an
organization we run.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would UPS help launch an attack on rail safety?
</P>
<P>
   Black said UPS has a general interest in transportation safety
and a financial interest in reliable rail service. It spends more
than $500 million a year having trailers moved by rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've got 50 trailers on a train that goes down or is
delayed for some safety-related reason, we have a huge liability,''
Black said. ``And it doesn't even have to be that train, because a
safety problem on one slows down many others.''
</P>
<P>
   Service snarls that followed last year's merger of two big
systems, Burlington Northern and Sante Fe, heightened UPS'
discontent.
</P>
<P>
   The company's differences with railroads don't stop there. UPS,
which has a large long-haul truck fleet, wants limits on
triple-trailer trucks relaxed. The public relations firm that set
up RailWatch also runs another UPS-supported group advocating
relaxed limits, according to the industry journal Traffic World.
</P>
<P>
   The rail industry opposes bigger trucks because it would lose
business to them. It has supported lobbying groups such as
Coalition Against Bigger Trucks and Citizens for Reliable and Safe
Highways, or CRASH.
</P>
<P>
   Black, however, said UPS didn't help start RailWatch to
retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joined because our network depends on the railroads,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS's role in RailWatch came to light after questions about the
authenticity of the list of local officials the group claimed as
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the list was compiled at a National League of Cities
convention in Kansas City in December. Officials who stopped by a
RailWatch booth could leave their names to get more materials.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Fox, executive director of Houston-based RailWatch, said
the booth was clearly marked as soliciting supporters. She said
visitors who left their names got follow-up materials stating they
would be listed.
</P>
<P>
   But after RailWatch's kickoff, some local officials told the
Houston Chronicle they had no idea they were on any list. Numerous
others told Traffic World and The Washington Post the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Toccoa Mayor James Neal, one of 16 Georgians named, said he,
too, was mystified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I wasn't appointed, and I don't remember being asked
to join,'' he said when contacted by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The same went for Calhoun city Councilman John Shelton, who
added: ``My family is basic railroad people. I'm not interested in
(the group's activities). I won't be party to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal said he went to the convention and may have left a business
card, though he doesn't remember doing so. ``I stop at booths all
the time and leave cards,'' he said. ``If leaving a card there was
tantamount to joining, I guess I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toccoa mayor said he didn't know about UPS' backing until
told by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hendrie of the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington
said launching a special interest group and then enlisting broad
public support is known as Astroturf lobbying _ meaning artificial
grass roots are used to add credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not new, but it is certainly a growing
phenomenon,'' Hendrie said. ``The intent is to create a bandwagon
effect by presenting a long list of supporters with no financial
stake. It also tends to get more favorable news coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said there was no attempt to create false support. She said
the group, which also includes rail accident victims and other
concerned citizens, is a product of sincere concerns that happen to
coincide with those of UPS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a coalition of real people who have real concerns about
rail safety,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she regrets any confusion caused by the group's method
of enlisting supporters. She said a few officials have asked to be
removed from the supporters list, adding the entire list is being
re-compiled.
</P>
<P>
   Fox suggested railroad interests are behind attacks on RailWatch
``to divert attention to their safety record, which is not entirely
unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said UPS has ``made it clear to RailWatch that we were
very disappointed'' with the way the list of public officials was
handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the railroads to know UPS is part of this group and
they better understand why,'' he said. ``It's because they have a
lousy safety record in certain corridors of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom White, spokesman for the Association of American Railroads,
said RailWatch's initial report was ``pretty shoddy work and makes
an awful lot of unwarranted statements. It totally ignores the fact
the rail industry is the safest it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on RailWatch's origin or methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we know is what we read about them,'' he said.

<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ When General Motors Corp. was paralyzed by a
54-day strike last summer, several Wall Street analysts offered the
same solution: GM's leaders should go to the home of Peter J.
Pestillo, the longtime labor czar of Ford Motor Co., and offer him
any sum of money, no matter how large, to fix their problems.
</P>
<P>
   GM never took this unsolicited advice, and the strike cost it $2
billion in after-tax profits. But Wall Street's perspective
highlighted the reputation of Pestillo, one of the most influential
yet little known executives in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, he has set labor policy for Ford and
indirectly for the entire auto industry, and, by extension,
influenced wages and costs across a wide range of industries. By
encouraging factory managers to work closely with workers and union
leaders, he has helped bring Ford's quality close to Japanese
levels.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Pestillo has quietly come to dominate auto
industry lobbying, playing a role in issues from air pollution to
fuel economy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Ford has not had a single strike in the
United States since 1986. By comparison, GM's strike-related losses
in the last three years approach the Microsoft Corp.'s entire sales
and profits last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his power, Pestillo, who will turn 61 on Monday, has
worked almost entirely behind the scenes. Like the invisible man of
Hollywood movies, whose presence can be inferred by his effect on
nearby objects, Pestillo has influenced Ford's recent success yet
has seldom appeared in public.
</P>
<P>
   Now Pestillo is being dragged reluctantly into the limelight. An
executive vice president for years, he became Ford's vice chairman
and chief of staff at the beginning of this year when a longtime
ally, William C. Ford Jr., became Ford's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Pestillo also became the chairman of the auto
industry's new lobbying arm, the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers, which has replaced the defunct American Automobile
Manufacturers Association. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pestillo may draw more attention in coming months. The United
Automobile Workers' three-year labor contracts with Ford, GM and
DaimlerChrysler AG will expire in September. The UAW's triennial
convention to draw up bargaining positions will open next Sunday,
the start of the negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview, Pestillo said that he believed his relative
anonymity had helped him, particularly in his many talks with the
UAW. ``To the extent you're less public, you can be more effective
in private,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most auto company labor negotiators are former factory managers
with MBAs, but Pestillo has a different background. The son of a
union machinist, he grew up in Plainville, Conn., and worked his
first summer after high school at a ball bearing company, where he
was a dues-paying member of the UAW.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Fairfield University, he worked his way
through Georgetown University's law school in Washington by holding
a series of government jobs, including one as a Capitol policeman.
</P>
<P>
   The many hours of guarding Congress coincided with his course in
labor law and contributed to a lifelong fascination with politics,
both at the national level and within unions.
</P>
<P>
   After stints at General Electric and B.F. Goodrich, Pestillo
came to Ford in 1980, and has been running its labor policy ever
since. He has worked to transform the way Ford factories are run,
transferring responsibility to assembly line workers.
</P>
<P>
   He has also forced out factory managers who could not get along
with workers or the union. ``In the old days, they were happy to
have loads of union grievances and disciplinary actions to prove
how tough they were,'' Pestillo said. ``Now we measure how
effective they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Harbour and Associates, a manufacturing consulting
firm, reported that Ford ran 4 of the nation's 10 most productive
car factories and 7 of the 10 most productive light truck
factories. (Japanese automakers operated most of the rest.)
</P>
<P>
   The UAW traditionally negotiates a three-year agreement with one
automaker and then demands that the others accept the same deal.
For most of the last 20 years, the union has gone to Ford first
because of its cooperative relationship, and Pestillo has used this
opportunity to negotiate deals that have cut Ford's costs but done
little to help its rival, GM.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers can now pay much lower wages, for instance, to
workers in their first three years of employment. Ford has been
hiring thousands to build its popular sport utility vehicles, but
GM has been thinning through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Some auto industry leaders dispute how much credit Pestillo
deserves for keeping Ford free of strikes. Richard G. Wagoner Jr.,
the president of GM, said Pestillo had an easy task because Ford
closed unneeded factories in the early 1980s and has been expanding
since. ``I'm not aware of any special magic he has,'' Wagoner said.
</P>
<P>
   But that view remains a minority opinion. Indeed, John F. Smith
Jr., GM's chairman and chief executive, said in a separate
interview that Ford seemed to have benefited from Pestillo's close
relationship with the UAW and its current president, Stephen P.
Yokich.
</P>
<P>
   Yokich said that while his union maintained a businesslike
relationship with Ford, he considered Pestillo a friend, someone
with whom he enjoyed having a beer, playing golf or simply talking.
``That's the best reason we get along,'' he said. ``We both can
laugh at each other and enjoy it.''

EDITORIAL: SPITZER'S INQUIRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 19:
</P>
<P>
   The police shooting last month of the West African immigrant
Amadou Diallo is provoking ever-larger protests. Well-televised
arrests at One Police Plaza trumpet the message that many New
Yorkers believe the steep drop in crime has been accompanied by an
increase in police harassment of minorities. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
says the demonstrations are being conducted ``for a highly partisan
political purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also true that nonviolent sit-ins have become an
established form of dissent when communities confront polarizing
issues, and orderly protests can challenge elected officials to
respond to civic concerns they might otherwise ignore. The fact
that the American Jewish Committee has joined with black officials
in questioning police conduct shows that worries about New York's
policing practices cross racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   In this context of community concern, the response of New York
state's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, was appropriate. Spitzer
announced a civil rights investigation into allegations that the
police frisk many blacks and other minorities without
justification. Giuliani, while angry at the demonstrators,
correctly recognized Spitzer's right to conduct an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said that during his campaign for the
office last year he began hearing that New York City police were
targeting nonwhites for improper searches. The complaints became
more vocal and public after Feb. 4, when Diallo was killed in a
fusillade of gunfire from four white police officers. A grand jury
in the Bronx and federal prosecutors are investigating the
shooting. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission has announced plans to
hold hearings. What could distinguish the Spitzer investigation,
however, is that it is focused narrowly enough to analyze police
data quickly and make useful recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The Street Crimes Unit, whose officers were involved in the
shooting, has been credited with lowering the murder rate by taking
large numbers of illegal handguns off the street. Street Crimes
police also stop many more people than they arrest, frisking 27,000
last year and arresting 4,600. The attorney general will need to
determine whether this unit has followed police guidelines, which
allow frisking only if the officer ``reasonably suspects'' that a
person could endanger police or others.
</P>
<P>
   For Spitzer, who was elected last year by a slim margin, using
the civil rights powers of his office to look at this crucial issue
is a bold move. It would be easy for his political enemies to label
this investigation as anti-police. But as Spitzer has said
correctly, this inquiry, if done well, is ``good for cops'' because
it can help rebuild the city's faith in the methods of its Police
Department. &QL;

 &HT;    Get the point, people?
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Late last summer, Duke's Will Avery
pulled an article off the Internet that included a list of college
basketball's best point guards. His name was nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It named everybody _ Mateen Cleaves (of Michigan State),
Arthur Lee (of Stanford) _ all those guys,'' Avery said. ``I
thought I could play with any of them and, if I worked hard, I
could play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery attached the article to the mirror on his dresser so that
he would see it every day. Why? ``I like a challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Every preseason story about Duke contained the following
sentence, in one form or another: ``Duke will go to the Final Four
and play for the national championship if William Avery can handle
the point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I read every one,'' Avery said. ``It was definitely a
motivating factor for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As a junior at Augusta's Westside High, Avery was a superstar on
the court but didn't have the grades to go to Duke, his first
choice. Coach Mike Krzyzewski told him flat out: Shape up
academically or look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge. Avery went to Virginia's Oak Hill Academy,
got his act together and was accepted to Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought I would never make it into Duke, but I
proved them wrong,'' he said. ``I shocked a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenges are obviously the fuel that keeps the sophomore's
motor running, and, since ascending to the starting job at Duke, he
has played as well as any point guard in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Doubt it? Duke (34-1), which plays Southwest Missouri State in
tonight's East Regional semifinals, has two national player of the
year candidates in Elton Brand and Trajan Langdon. On Thursday,
when asked to pick Duke's MVP for this season, each picked Avery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything starts with Will,'' said Langdon, the only senior
among the starting five. ``He's the guy who breaks down the
defenses and puts pressure on the other team. If things aren't
going well offensively, he can create something without running a
play. He brings an unpredictability to what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the guys who have had special years for us, Will's has
been the most special,'' Krzyzewski said. ``He gives us some things
we haven't had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery's numbers are impressive. He is the team's third-leading
scorer (15.1), its assists leader (5.3) and has averaged more
minutes per game (30.7) than any other Duke player.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers do not begin to tell how Avery's play has
transformed Duke from what was a talented, but methodical, team a
year ago to one that now can physically dominate opponents on both
ends of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays from last week's second-round game with Tulsa
illustrate it best.
</P>
<P>
   On one possession, Tulsa was playing its very best defense,
making sure the powerful Brand did not get the ball inside. As the
shot clock ticked down, Avery simply stopped running the offense
and launched a 3-pointer from well beyond the NBA arc. The ball
went through as the shot clock expired. Later, Avery recovered a
loose ball 70 feet from the basket. Tulsa had three defenders back
but Avery blew past all three for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't be that good!'' CBS analyst Al McGuire screamed after
the play.
</P>
<P>
   But Avery is that good, and he's doing it at a place where point
guards are basketball royalty. The list of great ones includes
Tommy Amaker, Quin Snyder and Bobby Hurley. None of them could make
plays like Avery.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got him, we knew he was good, but we never dreamed he
would be this good, this fast,'' Krzyzewski said. ``And he's only
going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery has gotten so good, so fast, that Duke fans now wonder if
he will jump to the NBA if the Blue Devils win the national
championship. Avery insists he'll be back at Duke next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked too hard to get here,'' he said. ``Besides, I'm
having too much fun.

 &HT;    Hooked on chance to fish with best
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Bud Goeke, retired at the age of 40, already
is the envy of most middle-agers. So what would spur the
Pinckneyville, Ill., family man to drive nearly nine hours on the
chance of fulfilling a dream?
</P>
<P>
   His proud young son.
</P>
<P>
   Goeke, one of the 165 anglers competing in the co-angler _ or
amateur _ division of this week's Wal-Mart FLW Tour bass tournament
at Lake Lanier, had pretty much decided he wasn't going to come
South with no assurance that he'd be able to fish in the richest
tournament in Georgia history. That was until 10-year-old Brandon,
who knows who most of the sport's top stars are, got involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told all of his friends we were coming to this
tournament,'' said Goeke, who was able to retire two years ago from
Caterpillar because of investments he made in a pizza restaurant
and rental property. ``He really wanted to come. I couldn't let him
down.''
</P>
<P>
   So Goeke packed up the car Tuesday morning and, with Brandon,
his wife Susan and 7-year-old daughter Katlyn, headed for Atlanta
from the southern Illinois town to make it to the pretournament
meeting later in the day. At best, he was told he'd be second or
third on the waiting list and would need that many no-shows to be
able to fish alongside the anglers he watches every week on those
TV fishing shows.

EDITORIAL: SURRENDERING ON MISSILE DEFENSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 19:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration this week capitulated to Republican
pressure to begin building a missile defense system at the earliest
technologically feasible date. It was a political decision,
designed to shield the White House from accusations in next year's
campaign that it was complacent about protecting American security.
Though the need to develop such a system is real, the rush to put
one in place invites wasteful spending and could undermine critical
arms reduction treaties with Russia that are no less important to
America's defense. To avoid those mistakes, the White House must
now manage this program with great care.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the damage is mainly symbolic. But to prevent more
serious harm, the administration will have to stand up to
Republican simplifications on the issue in the campaign. President
Clinton has said he will decide in June 2000 whether a defensive
system should be built right away or deferred to a later date. It
seems unlikely that a working system will be ready by then, and
Clinton must not let himself be stampeded into approving
construction prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of a missile defense system no longer talk about
Ronald Reagan's overly ambitious notions about space-based weapons
that can knock out thousands of incoming Soviet missiles. At issue
now is a much more limited, ground-based system meant to shield
against a handful of missiles launched by unpredictable countries
like North Korea. Since North Korea successfully tested a
long-range missile last year, there has been a strong case for an
accelerated effort to design an effective missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Intercepting and destroying an incoming missile before it
descends through the atmosphere is a daunting technological
challenge. The target is small and traveling at 15,000 miles an
hour, much faster than a bullet. It must be hit accurately and
reliably. All but 2 of 15 tests so far have failed. Research
efforts should be intensified.
</P>
<P>
   This week's congressional votes pushing the program will make it
harder to work with Moscow on nuclear weapons issues because the
House and Senate in effect declared that arms control now has
become a secondary consideration for the United States. A limited
missile defense system would not be very effective against a
country like Russia, which still has nearly 7,000 nuclear warheads
that can reach the United States. But convincing Moscow of that
will now be much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The administration should have held its ground on this complex
and serious issue. But it can still exercise restraint. An
expensive system of unproven reliability should not be built, even
with an election bearing down on Washington.

ECUADOREAN PRESIDENT LIFTS STATE OF EMERGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ Eager to avoid prolonging the strikes and
economic turmoil that have paralyzed this country since the
beginning of the month, President Jamil Mahuad Thursday lifted the
state of emergency he imposed last week and rolled back drastic
increases in gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   In return, opposition parties agreed to approve an austerity
package that Mahuad estimated will increase revenues by $520
million. The legislators also consented to an unpopular
presidential decree that freezes half of most bank accounts for as
long as a year.
</P>
<P>
   News of the accord was followed here by a marked relaxation of
the tensions in this Andean nation of 12 million that had
threatened to topple Mahuad's young government. Taxi drivers
removed barriers that had blocked many streets since Monday, and
some shops opened for the first time this week.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, lines formed for fuel at the new price of
about $1.20 a gallon, a huge drop from last week's $2.33 a gallon
(calculated at Thursday's exchange rate), but still above its
original 89 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   At a pre-dawn news conference at the presidential palace here,
Mahuad said that legislators would probably vote on the austerity
package soon and called on Ecuadoreans to ``return to peace and to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   With nearly $3 billion in damages caused by El Nino, along with
low oil prices and the highest inflation rate in Latin America,
Ecuador had been struggling with an economic crisis even before
Mahuad, a 49-year-old Harvard-educated lawyer, took office in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Several bank failures led him to declare a weeklong bank holiday
on March 8 and a 60-day emergency the next day. The Ecuadorean
currency, the sucre, nearly disintegrated as savers rushed to buy
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was announced hours after the powerful Ecuadorean
military made its first statement on the issue, which pointedly
reminded quarreling civilian elites of ``the very serious
responsibility weighing upon them'' and urged lawmakers to ``reach
the solutions which the Ecuadorean people urgently demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad was able to obtain the agreement by stitching together a
tenuous coalition in the Ecuadorean Congress. His Popular
Democratic Party had been in an alliance with the conservative
Social Christian Party, but that group abandoned him this week
after condemning the austerity measures as ``inhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   The new coalition brings together nine parties from the
center-right to the far left. They account for total of 70 of the
121 seats in Congress, but the alliance appears to veteran
political analysts to be unwieldy, unworkable and unlikely to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very complicated cocktail, one that I cannot see
functioning in the long term,'' Rodrigo Paz, a former finance
minister and mayor of Quito, said. ``All the classic problems of
Ecuadorean politics could emerge again, because it is much easier
to form an association with one party than with five or six that
have diverse ideologies.''

STEAM PLANT STILL STANDING BETWEEN PATRIOTS, STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ It all boils down to... a steam plant.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by criticism that it is holding out for an unreasonable
price, the steam plant company distributed copies of its property
assessment as proof it needs about $48 million to cover the costs
of relocating its Hartford headquarters to make way for a new
stadium for the New England Patriots stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But local business leaders, though eager to bring the team here,
said they were willing to contribute no more than $25 million to
move the offices of CTG Resources Inc.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of terse recriminations between Connecticut
Governor John G. Rowland and CTG's chief executive, Arthur
Marquardt, the two sides were no closer to bridging the funding gap
_ or to resolving a related dispute over terms of moving the steam
plant itself. Failure to do so could kill the stadium deal.
</P>
<P>
   While that prospect has caught the attention of Massachusetts
political leaders, key players in last year's efforts to keep the
team in Foxborough said that for now they were watching from the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Marquardt, at press conference in the company's nondescript
concrete offices, suggested his shareholders would not pay the
difference. And Robert Kraft, owner of the Patriots, doesn't want
to pay for it either, according to people close to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence other businesses stepping up with money, that
would leave Nutneg State taxpayers, many of whom are unhappy that
public money would finance construction of the $374 million stadium
along the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not be asked,'' said Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani.
``The governor has made clear there's no more state money to be put
on the table; $374 million is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   That money was approved by the General Assembly in December to
build the Patriots a new home. But in the rush to get the deal
done, Rowland did not set aside specific funds to relocate CTG's
building. And agreement on a plan to cover the estimated cost of
$47 million to $60 million to move the steam plant, which sits on
the 50 yard line of the proposed stadium, is being held up by what
Rowland has called unreasonable demands by CTG.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are being further strained by an April 2
deadline by which the state must prove three things to Kraft: That
the steam plant can be moved in time for stadium construction to
begin by the summer of 2000; that the team will not be liable for
an environmental damage on the site; and that there is ample
funding and planning to allow parking lots around the football
field to empty in one hour after games.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly wary of the timeframe, officials have been trying
to downplay that deadline in recent days. According to the
agreement between the team and the state, there is a 30-day window
beyond April 2 for Kraft to decide if he wants to continue pursuing
a Hartford stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots spokesman had no comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Boston, spokeswomen for Governor Paul Cellucci and
Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham said the leaders were closely
watching events in Hartford, but could do little other than refile
bills that died last year offering up to $72 million in land and
infrastructure aid for the team to rebuild in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   And House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, whose fierce opposition to
public funding for a stadium prevented a deal in the team's home
state, remained immutable Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sense that there has been any shift at all,'' Finneran
told the Globe. ``The Senate bill was dreadful in the view of most
members and it set us on a path that could not be sustained or
justified. The precedents attached to that one were staggering.''

<P>
   Finneran has refiled his own bill, offering $57 million,
strictly for improvements to infrastructure along Route 1 in
Foxborough even though Kraft said that legislation was not enough
to keep the team in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran's political foil, Rowland, may be paying a price for
his enthusiasm to lure the Patriots to Hartford as part of a $1
billion urban revitalization project.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a soft spoken Marquardt, standing next to a panel of
architects and construction experts who valued the office
relocation at $48 million, said he was surprised the state was only
now scrambling to cover the expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a project like this to work, you have to do the
due diligence, do your homework, and make sure you have a funding
mechanism. That was evidently not done and it's not the fault of
the people who happen to be working here,'' Marquardt said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Rowland publicly blasted Marquardt for not being a
good corporate citizen and for upping the price on a prized piece
of property, despite agreeing to move well before the Patriots
signed the Hartford deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the animosity between the governor and the steam plant
executive has gotten personal, according to those familiar with the
talks.

HOUSE JOINS SENATE IN APPROVING MISSILE-DEFENSE SYSTEM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House joined the Senate on Thursday in voting
to develop and deploy a nationwide missile-defense system capable
of intercepting long-range nuclear warheads fired on the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But while the House vote of 317-105, and the Senate vote
Wednesday of 97-3, embraced the idea of anti-missile defense as
policy, the approval did not authorize any funding for construction
of such a system or set a deadline for its deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bipartisan vote in both chambers does place
considerable pressure on President Clinton, who is scheduled to
decide in June of next year on whether to build a network of radar
and missile interceptors designed to knock down any nuclear
warheads intentionally fired by rogue nations or accidentally
launched from China or Russia.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton gives the project a green light, it would still be
2005 at the earliest before it would be ready, according to
Pentagon officials, who have warned lawmakers that any system built
would not be the kind of ``umbrellalike'' space- and land-based
network originally envisioned in President's Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative of 1983 known as ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can build a system that knocks some incoming (missiles)
down. But we can't build one that can get all of them if there's a
full-scale attack,'' said one Defense Department official.
</P>
<P>
   The debate in the House and Senate, however, centered on the
possibility of a single or limited missile attack by a nation such
as North Korea or Iran. That concern was heightened in a classified
briefing that lawmakers were given Thursday on the House floor by a
special panel headed by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.
The panel was authorized by Congress to study the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers told reporters later that Rumsfeld said at least 25
nations now have or will soon have a ballistic weapons capability
that enables them to launch nuclear missiles at the United States.
Rumsfeld also stressed in the briefing that North Korea and others
are dedicating huge spending efforts to developing long-range
missile programs.
</P>
<P>
   House Intelligence Committee Chairman Porter Goss, R-Fla., said
the Rumsfeld panel's report makes clear that ``the threat is
real.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is growing and more immediate than many have thought,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers said the sense of urgency over whether to pursue
``Star Wars II,'' as one member called it, was heightened by North
Korea's test last August of a three-stage missile. That test, which
followed a trajectory over Japan, caused some Democrats who had
long been opposed to spending the billions it will require to build
an anti-missile defense system to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James A. Traficant, D-Ohio, was one of them. ``Who are we
kidding. We've got to do something,'' he said, citing the Korean
test. ``You cannot protect America with a neighborhood crime
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Reps. Jim Turner of Crockett and Sylvestre
Reyes of El Paso, also cited the successful North Korean test and
reports of Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos nuclear facility in
New Mexico as one reason they favor making it the policy of the
United States to deploy a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Although it drew strong bipartisan support, nearly half of the
House Democrats and a handful of Republicans voted against it,
insisting that it would only create another nuclear arms race and
end up draining precious resources from other deserving government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cold War is over, but they still want Star Wars,''said
Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, who accused the lead Republican
sponsors of the legislation of playing politics with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger is that it could touch off a new arms race
between us, the Russians, the Koreans and the Chinese,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Markey reminded his colleagues that ``the deterrent of an
overwhelming massive retaliatory response'' from the United States
would keep even rogue states from firing missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what kept the Soviets from firing at us, and that's the
threat that will keep other countries from firing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote in the House followed an unsuccessful attempt by
Democratic opponents to amend the legislation to make it look more
like the bill passed by the Senate. That measure contained two
compromise provisions that caused Clinton to withdraw a threatened
veto.
</P>
<P>
   One provision would force funding decisions for any missile
defense project to be made through regular congressional
appropriations channels each year. Another ties the development and
deployment to continued arms reductions efforts with the Soviet
Union. Language in the bill would leave final deployment decisions
to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Before the changes were made in the Senate bill, some Democrats
had voiced strong objections to the measure, saying that deploying
a missile defense system might violate the Anti-ballistic Missile
Treaty with Moscow. They also expressed concern that the votes in
Congress could set back steps taken by the Russian Parliament
earlier this week toward approving the second strategic arms
reduction treaty known as START 2.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill allows for no ``wiggle room,'' said Rep. Curt
Weldon, R-Pa., the chief sponsor of the measure. Weldon's bill
mandates that the president must build and deploy a missile defense
system, although it does not say when or what kind.
</P>
<P>
   But few House members expect Weldon's bill to be the one that
reaches Clinton's desk. Both the House and Senate versions will be
merged into a compromise measure in conference between the two
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   A missile defense system has long been a priority among
Republicans since Reagan unveiled his strategic defense initiative.
The Pentagon spent more than $50 billion on SDI, but never
developed a single system capable of doing all that Reagan had
promised. But some of that research was successful and has been
applied to other defense programs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has had no official policy on missile
defense, Presidents Bush and Clinton have included funding in the
defense budget proposals to keep the research going. Clinton, for
example, included $10.5 billion spread over five years in his 2000
budget proposal.

GLAUS DOES LITTLE THINGS TO HAVE A BIG DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Never mind that Troy Glaus hit two home runs,
added an RBI single and drove in six runs Thursday in the Angels'
13-7 victory over the Colorado Rockies at Tempe Diablo Stadium,
manager Terry Collins says.
</P>
<P>
   That was nice, but Collins is taking note of the little things
Glaus is doing at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day he drove the ball to right field with two
strikes,'' Collins said. ``That's what I want to see. When he's
behind in the count, he'll go the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus has been working with hitting coach Rod Carew to improve
his stroke, which is what he needs to do to beat out Dave Hollins
for the starting spot at third base. Collins says neither player
has an edge at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins has been bothered off and on by a sore left hamstring
all spring, and he's coming off an injury-plagued 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to factor that in,'' Collins admitted, ``but we've
also got to factor in _ is Troy Glaus ready? He tore it up last
spring, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus knows if he doesn't win the starting spot, he goes back to
Triple-A. So it's all or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give them a reason to keep me,'' he said. ``Because
they have the option to send me out. I have to eliminate all
possibilities of that.''
</P>
<P>
   With his big day Thursday, Glaus is hitting .429 (12 for 28)
with two homers and a team-leading 14 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Mo better: Wednesday afternoon, Mo Vaughn told reporters he
wasn't worried about his offense after a slow spring start. But he
went to his room Wednesday night and did something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at some tapes from last year,'' he said. ``I've got a
good set-up now. It's about time. Regardless of the workouts you do
and the hitting in the offseason, it's a couple of weeks before you
trust yourself at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Vaughn drove in two runs with a double in the first
inning and also had a single in the Angels' 21-hit attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took batting practice with a purpose today, and he went
into the game today with a purpose,'' Collins said. ``He hit four
balls on the button.''
</P>
<P>
   The edge: Starting pitcher Ken Hill gave up one run and four
hits in four innings Thursday while making 74 pitches. His
surgically repaired right elbow is obviously fine, so now it's
about getting back ``the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing for me is mentally getting the edge back, the
killer instinct,'' Hill said. ``That's what I'm mainly trying to
work on, getting a feel for everything and being aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   That's more like it: Garret Anderson played all nine innings in
right field Thursday, had three hits and showed the kind of hustle
that's expected from him.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of trade rumors all winter and during spring
training, Anderson was yanked from a game last season when he
failed to run hard on an infield grounder in Baltimore. But even in
a blowout spring game like Thursday's, Anderson worked hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very impressed with the way he's running the ball out,
he's running hard,'' Collins said, adding that even getting thrown
out trying for an extra base _ as Anderson did Thursday _ is a good
sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to continue to try it,'' Collins said. ``We want to be
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Pitcher Jack McDowell is planning to throw this weekend
for the first time since having shoulder surgery Feb. 3. Early
estimates pointed to a possible return by August, but McDowell is
shooting for the All-Star break. . . . The Angels travel to HoHoKam
Park in Mesa today to play the Cubs beginning at 12:05 p.m. Steve
Sparks will start for Anaheim against Chicago's Terry Mulholland.

MICROSOFT'S SLIMMED-DOWN WEB BROWSER AIMS TO BROADEN DISTRIBUTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The pitch was given on a stage designed to resemble a
homey living room, but when Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates,
introduced a new version of his company's Web browser Friday, the
most surprising new feature was all business.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the redesign was about trimming fat to produce a
leaner program, the new browser, Internet Explorer 5.0, includes a
feature that enables Internet sites to distribute their own
versions of the program, customized with, for example, basic search
or multimedia features or their own logos.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it will appear to Web surfers that the browser
comes from companies like Alta Vista, Yahoo or Lycos _ all of which
already have signed on _ not from Microsoft Corp., which until now
has jealously guarded its branding.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape Communications Corp., Microsoft's chief rival in the
browser market, has allowed this kind of customization of its
Navigator browser for some customers, like the At Home cable modem
service. In addition, it publishes its source code, so that any
programmer can customize any feature.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said that while they would lose some prime
real estate for displaying their own brand, the customization
feature would persuade online businesses to standardize on Internet
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Explorer 5.0 also includes features designed to make
surfing the Web faster and simpler. But thousands of customers
discovered there was nothing fast or simple about downloading the
new browser.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 can be set to log on to the Internet whenever the
computer is turned on, to check for updates or repairs to the
operating system. People who had employed this feature turned on
their computers Thursday to see a ``Critical Update'' notice,
informing them that the new browser was available. But traffic at
the download site was so heavy that many were unable to log on.
</P>
<P>
   Yusuf Mehdi, director of Windows marketing, said the company had
prepared for heavy traffic but that he did not know how many people
had tried, successfully or not, to download the new browser.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Netscape and Microsoft have sought to attract
customers with new features. But Microsoft seems to be retreating
from that strategy. It reduced the number of menu buttons on the
browser's top line to 11 from 13 and cut the size of the most basic
browser functions by about half compared with version 4.0 _ to 6.5
megabytes versus 14 megabytes. But consumers who choose this
skeletal version will have to download additional features as
needed while surfing the Web. The fully loaded browser, including
programs necessary to view multimedia and other nontext information
on the Internet, still will be 29 megabytes, verses 40 for version
4.0.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi said the changes were driven by consumer research
indicating that customers wanted a simpler browser.
</P>
<P>
   But David Kerley, an analyst for Jupiter Communications, a
market research firm in New York, said he saw a larger trend. The
battle for browser market share, he said, would no longer be won by
impressing consumers with features but by cutting better strategic
deals for distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Gates ended the program by introducing a so-called radio toolbar
that allows users listen to one of 350 radio stations while they
surf other sites.
</P>
<P>
   But to use this feature, ``you're going to want a fast
connection,'' Mehdi said.

CLINTON ASKS RUDMAN TO PROBE CHINA NUCLEAR SECRETS LEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Thursday ordered former Senator
Warren Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican, to lead a review of the
security threat to US nuclear research labs in the wake of
suspicions that China stole nuclear weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am determined to do all that is necessary to protect our
sensitive national security information and to prevent its
diversion to foreign countries,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, chaired by
Rudman, to conduct an analysis of the security threat at the
Department of Energy's weapons labs and analyze the adequacy of the
measures that have been taken. Clinton asked Rudman to share his
findings with Congress and the public within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Clinton acted on the recommendation of his National Security
Adviser, Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger. Some Republicans have demanded
Berger's resignation, saying the administration has mishandled the
alleged espionage case.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have accused the White House of dragging its feet in
investigating China's alleged use in the mid-1980s of secrets from
the Los Alamos, N.M., nuclear research lab on making miniaturized
nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy denied the Clinton administration was caving in to
political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy felt it was prudent and appropriate that we take this
step,'' he said. Leavy said Berger consulted with Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson and they agreed to make the recommendation to
Clinton, who called Rudman Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The review is expected to addresss the present
counterintelligence security threat, how it evolved over the last
two decades and steps the administration has taken to counter it,
as well as recommending additional safeguards that may be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The review will be conducted by Rudman and four others on the
independent, bipartisan, 12-member advisory panel that advises the
president on national security matters. Among those chosen Thursday
were vice chairman Anthony S. Harrington, a Washington lawyer, and
Dr. Sidney D. Drell, a professor and deputy director of the
Stanford University Linear Accelerator Center. The remaining two
members have yet to be named.
</P>
<P>
   The review is the second one ordered this week. On Monday, CIA
head George Tenet asked for a damage assessment of how much nuclear
weapons techonology, if any, was lost to China through a suspected
spy working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is holding hearings on the espionage case, and some
House members are demanding that a 700-page classified report on
technology transfers to China be made public.
</P>
<P>
   A Taiwanese-born computer scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired from
Los Alamos last week for violating security regulations amid
suspicions that he leaked secrets to the Chinese in the 1980s. The
FBI has been investigating the case since 1996, but Lee has not
been charged with any crime. Richardson, the energy secretary, said
he did not know if Lee would be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Richardson told Congress he planned to tighten
security at the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories. Former CIA
Director John Deutch is to help decide whether too many foreign
visitors are admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Chinese diplomat Thursday denied allegations that
his country stole nuclear weapons designs. The official blamed a
Cold War mentality and ``political atmospherics'' for the furor
that has prompted FBI and Energy Department investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department, responding quickly, said the United
States remains ``deeply concerned about reports of China's attempts
to illegally acquire sensitive US technology.''
</P>
<P>
   That concern is ``shared widely by both branches, the executive
and legislative branches of government, by both political
parties,'' said James P. Foley, the deputy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no division there. The Chinese should not read our
concern over espionage as a partisan matter or a matter that's
manufactured by opponents of US-China relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese diplomat, He Yafei, a minister-counsel at the
Chinese Embassy, insisted ``the Sino-US relationship has become the
victim of party politics in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Monica Lewinsky scandal, he said: ``You all know how
party politics play, especially when you're nearing a major
election. You have seen the outcry or the big media coverage on the
Lewinsky issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat accused critics of harboring Cold War instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are sorry there is no more Soviet Union and they don't
know how to act,'' said He, referring to those accusing China of
espionage at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   But, asserting the two nations and the world benefit from
scientific exchanges, the Chinese diplomat cautioned: ``Don't go
too far so that normal scientific exchanges are affected. It will
not only hurt other countries, but it will hurt US interests, too,
because in the long run any advance in science and technology is
not dependent on scientists of one country alone.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the dispute could harm improving relations between
Washington and Beijing, and that some Chinese scientists were
questioning whether to continue scientific exchanges ``to advance
our knowledge of nuclear science.''
</P>
<P>
   With Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongii due here next month, He
said ``there are some people in the United States who do not want
to see progress in the Sino-US relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not identify anyone, and specifically excluded Berger,
who supports closer ties with China. On Sunday, Berger said
``there's no question'' China benefited from important information
leaked from the Los Alamos laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the allegations of espionage and theft, He replied
that ``nothing of this sort has ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China never benefited from anything that is illegal,'' the
diplomat said. ``We have normal exchange programs. Of course each
side will benefit from these exchange programs, otherwise it will
be meaningless. But it has nothing to do with nuclear military
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, He returned to his central theme, that US-Chinese
relations generally and scientific cooperation specifically were in
jeopardy from people opposed to progress between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let Chinese-US relations become hostage to that,'' He
implored.

<P>
   PARIS _ Peace talks on Kosovo concluded Thursday night with
representatives of the ethnic Albanian majority in the province
signing an agreement on autonomy that was worked out by
international mediators, while the Serbian authorities still
refused to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   That left France and Britain, co-chairmen of the talks, with
little choice but to declare the negotiations over, since most of
the ethnic Albanians plan to leave on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said on Thursday night that Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine of France and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of
Britain, who were in Bonn on Thursday, would end or suspend the
talks on Friday, possibly giving the Serbs until Wednesday to
change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   That would give Serbian delegates one last chance to go to
Belgrade and would give President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
a last chance to accept agreement before NATO would be forced to
decide whether to make good on its longstanding threat to bomb
Serbian military targets if Milosevic stands in the way of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's stubborn refusal to compromise appeared to be making
the allies more determined than ever to show that this time they
mean business. President Jacques Chirac of France conferred with
military and security advisers on the issue Thursday, and the mood
in Paris was one of grim resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30,000 to 40,000 Serbian troops and special police forces
continued deploying in and around Kosovo on Thursday into positions
that could allow them to start a large-scale offensive against
ethnic Albanian positions or retaliate against them in the event of
NATO air strikes. Those deployments are in violation of pledges
Milosevic made last fall to withdraw most of those forces and stop
attacks that have driven more than 200,000 civilians from their
homes in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks on Serbian troop positions, its sophisticated air
defense system and other military targets could begin as early as
next week, the allies say, unless Milosevic decides to accept the
peace plan and 28,000 allied-led peacekeepers to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's top military commander, said on
Thursday after visiting NATO troops already gathering in Macedonia,
``There should be no doubt in the minds of the Serb military and
police leaders that should NATO act, their military and police
forces would be devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the decision is made, NATO military forces are prepared to
act,'' Clark said. NATO is prepared to devote 400 American and
European planes, including B-52 bombers with cruise missiles, to
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which is a co-sponsor of the talks here along with the
United States, France, Britain, Germany and Italy, opposes the use
of military force against the Serbs but appealed to them on
Thursday to settle peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, conferred by
telephone from Moscow with Cook and Vedrine, who returned to Paris
on Thursday night, and with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov appealed to the Serbian leadership to let delegates here
sign what he called ``the political document put forward by the
working group.'' European, American and Russian mediators at the
talks worked out the 81-page agreement that the Albanians signed on
Thursday night, but the Russian mediator, Boris Mayorsky, was the
only mediator who did not also sign as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Thursday, the mediators met with the Serbian
delegation again, but Philip T. Reeker, the chief spokesman for the
talks, said there had been no change in the Serbian position. The
Serbs left the talks before the Albanian signing ceremony on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hill, the American negotiator for the six sponsoring
``contact group'' countries said the Serbs had demanded
unacceptable changes to the autonomy agreement and were refusing
even to discuss military and police measures to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Serbia would remain sovereign over Kosovo
for the next three years, though the Albanians would have home
rule, their own legal, educational and administrative systems, and
an Albanian police force.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NATO peacekeeping force, including 4,000 Americans,
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army would disband and the Serbs would
withdraw all but 1,500 security forces from the province within a
year. The remaining Serbian soldiers would guard the frontiers.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 of the peacekeepers would remain in Macedonia, where
the alliance now has 10,000 soldiers ready to move into Kosovo
under the command of a British general, Sir Michael Walker, but
only if there is finally a peace agreement. After three years, an
international conference would be called to discuss the future of
the province.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Albright, who secured the Albanians' agreement in principle to
the accord at the first phase of negotiations in Rambouillet
outside Paris last month, told four of their leaders here in a
20-minute telephone call on Thursday afternoon that their decision
to sign was ``a very important step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's spokesman, James Rubin, said she had also called on
the ethnic Albanians to maintain unity and calm in what could be
difficult days ahead, including the possibility that Serbian forces
might be preparing for a large-scale assault in Kosovo against
Albanian positions near Drenica.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something like that happens, next Wednesday is the
earliest day NATO is likely to make a decision on whether to go
ahead with air strikes, according to alliance officials in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   They said it would take 48 hours from the time the NATO
secretary general, Javier Solana, gave the go-ahead for bombs to
start falling.
</P>
<P>
   French officials said a French-led NATO extraction force that is
based in Macedonia was prepared to go into Kosovo if necessary to
evacuate the 2,000 civilian observers. Milosevic agreed to the
observers in October to oversee a cease-fire that both Serbian and
Albanian forces have often violated since then.

CLINTON ASKS RUDMAN TO PROBE CHINA NUCLEAR SECRETS LEAK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Thursday ordered former Senator
Warren Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican, to lead a review of the
security threat to US nuclear research labs in the wake of
suspicions that China stole nuclear weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am determined to do all that is necessary to protect our
sensitive national security information and to prevent its
diversion to foreign countries,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, chaired by
Rudman, to conduct an analysis of the security threat at the
Department of Energy's weapons labs and analyze the adequacy of the
measures that have been taken. Clinton asked Rudman to share his
findings with Congress and the public within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Clinton acted on the recommendation of his National Security
Adviser, Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger. Some Republicans have demanded
Berger's resignation, saying the administration has mishandled the
alleged espionage case.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have accused the White House of dragging its feet in
investigating China's alleged use in the mid-1980s of secrets from
the Los Alamos, N.M., nuclear research lab on making miniaturized
nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy denied the Clinton administration was caving in to
political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy felt it was prudent and appropriate that we take this
step,'' he said. Leavy said Berger consulted with Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson and they agreed to make the recommendation to
Clinton, who called Rudman Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The review is expected to addresss the present
counterintelligence security threat, how it evolved over the last
two decades and steps the administration has taken to counter it,
as well as recommending additional safeguards that may be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The review will be conducted by Rudman and four others on the
independent, bipartisan, 12-member advisory panel that advises the
president on national security matters. Among those chosen Thursday
were vice chairman Anthony S. Harrington, a Washington lawyer, and
Dr. Sidney D. Drell, a professor and deputy director of the
Stanford University Linear Accelerator Center. The remaining two
members have yet to be named.
</P>
<P>
   The review is the second one ordered this week. On Monday, CIA
head George Tenet asked for a damage assessment of how much nuclear
weapons techonology, if any, was lost to China through a suspected
spy working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is holding hearings on the espionage case, and some
House members are demanding that a 700-page classified report on
technology transfers to China be made public.
</P>
<P>
   A Taiwanese-born computer scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired from
Los Alamos last week for violating security regulations amid
suspicions that he leaked secrets to the Chinese in the 1980s. The
FBI has been investigating the case since 1996, but Lee has not
been charged with any crime. Richardson, the energy secretary, said
he did not know if Lee would be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Richardson told Congress he planned to tighten
security at the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories. Former CIA
Director John Deutch is to help decide whether too many foreign
visitors are admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Chinese diplomat Thursday denied allegations that
his country stole nuclear weapons designs. The official blamed a
Cold War mentality and ``political atmospherics'' for the furor
that has prompted FBI and Energy Department investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department, responding quickly, said the United
States remains ``deeply concerned about reports of China's attempts
to illegally acquire sensitive US technology.''
</P>
<P>
   That concern is ``shared widely by both branches, the executive
and legislative branches of government, by both political
parties,'' said James P. Foley, the deputy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no division there. The Chinese should not read our
concern over espionage as a partisan matter or a matter that's
manufactured by opponents of US-China relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese diplomat, He Yafei, a minister-counsel at the
Chinese Embassy, insisted ``the Sino-US relationship has become the
victim of party politics in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Monica Lewinsky scandal, he said: ``You all know how
party politics play, especially when you're nearing a major
election. You have seen the outcry or the big media coverage on the
Lewinsky issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat accused critics of harboring Cold War instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are sorry there is no more Soviet Union and they don't
know how to act,'' said He, referring to those accusing China of
espionage at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   But, asserting the two nations and the world benefit from
scientific exchanges, the Chinese diplomat cautioned: ``Don't go
too far so that normal scientific exchanges are affected. It will
not only hurt other countries, but it will hurt US interests, too,
because in the long run any advance in science and technology is
not dependent on scientists of one country alone.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the dispute could harm improving relations between
Washington and Beijing, and that some Chinese scientists were
questioning whether to continue scientific exchanges ``to advance
our knowledge of nuclear science.''
</P>
<P>
   With Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongii due here next month, He
said ``there are some people in the United States who do not want
to see progress in the Sino-US relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not identify anyone, and specifically excluded Berger,
who supports closer ties with China. On Sunday, Berger said
``there's no question'' China benefited from important information
leaked from the Los Alamos laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the allegations of espionage and theft, He replied
that ``nothing of this sort has ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China never benefited from anything that is illegal,'' the
diplomat said. ``We have normal exchange programs. Of course each
side will benefit from these exchange programs, otherwise it will
be meaningless. But it has nothing to do with nuclear military
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, He returned to his central theme, that US-Chinese
relations generally and scientific cooperation specifically were in
jeopardy from people opposed to progress between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let Chinese-US relations become hostage to that,'' He
implored.

ECUADOREAN LEADER RESCINDS STATE OF EMERGENCY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ As street barricades came down and striking
transportation workers went back to their jobs, Ecuador regained a
semblance of normalcy Thursday following two weeks of turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuadoreans breathed a collective sigh of relief when President
Jamil Mahuad announced early in the day that he had lowered
gasoline prices and lifted a week-old state of emergency, which, he
said, ``is no longer justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad rescinded the emergency decrees after opposition deputies
in Congress pledged to support a package of tax increases designed
to address the South American nation's worst economic meltdown in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecuador was on the brink,'' one senior Western diplomat said.
``But it looked over and decided not to jump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is giving off signals that it wants to turn the
crisis into an opportunity,'' said an editorial in the Quito daily
El Comercio.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad reportedly was also considering a gradual freeing up of
bank accounts that had been partially frozen last week to halt
capital flight.
</P>
<P>
   If the accord between the president and opposition deputies
holds, it would break months of gridlock. There were signs late
Thursday, however, that the fragile alliance could fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   A bloc of deputies from the Democratic Left Party threatened to
withdraw their support for the president's economic measures unless
Mahuad, who raised gasoline prices by more than 100 percent last
week, cuts fuel costs further.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders said the government had promised to restore
gasoline prices to the levels they were at before the state of
emergency was imposed. Even with Thursday's price cuts, gasoline
cost about 35 percent more than it did before the emergency decree.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition groups that had led massive demonstrations against
the government's economic policies and had called for Mahuad to
step down said they would decide Saturday whether to continue their
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's troubles were brought on by government overspending,
falling oil prices and $2.6 billion in flood damage caused by the
El Nio weather pattern last year. A government bailout of several
failing banks, coupled with the financial crisis in Brazil,
provoked capital flight, inflation and major devaluations of the
sucre _ the Ecuadorean currency.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a $1.6 billion budget deficit, equal to 7 percent
of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Banks were ordered shut last week. When they reopened Monday,
savings and checking accounts were partially frozen to prevent a
run on deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for revenue, Mahuad raised gasoline prices and
declared a state of emergency. The decrees provoked a nationwide
transportation strike, with Indian groups blocking sections of the
Pan-American Highway.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters clashed with riot police and called for Mahuad to
resign. At one point, Mahuad and his aides considered closing the
Congress and ruling by decree, according to U.S. Ambassador Leslie
M. Alexander. Analysts said the disturbances cost the nation $22
million a day.
</P>
<P>
   The lifting of the state of emergency Thursday, however, calmed
tensions nationwide. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Restaurants and supermarkets were back in business, and private
schools were scheduled to reopen Friday. Public schools remained
shut because of delays in the payment of teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   In Quito, some people said they would accept the new gasoline
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the obligation to support the state with our gas
taxes,'' one motorist said.
</P>
<P>
   The accord hammered out Thursday called for reinstatement of the
income tax, which had been abolished last year; the elimination of
a host of tax shields; and new taxes on banking transactions,
luxury cars and corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting revenue, plus rebounding oil prices, were expected
to bring in $520 million and close the budget deficit to about 3.5
percent of GDP, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the economic measures are enacted, analysts warned
that they are more of a Band-Aid than a long-term solution. Still
lacking, they said, are plans to cut government spending and
privatize inefficient state industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like emergency medicine,'' said political scientist
Fernando Bustamante. ``You do it to sustain and stabilize the
situation so that later, you can do what you need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Western diplomat predicted that Ecuador will remain
in dire economic straits for months to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not going to see an Ecuador in good shape or in good
health. You will see an Ecuador that still has to deal with
fundamental problems,'' he said.

 &HT;    Lady Dogs use depth, take lead
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ SMU senior All-American Martina Moravcova put on a
spectacular show Thursday, but her efforts were not enough to put
the Lady Mustangs in first place.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, host and pre-meet favorite Georgia took the lead after
the first day, and the Lady Bulldogs hope to add to it tonight
contending in three relay events and having Kristy Kowal favored in
the 100-yard breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's finals begin at 7 p.m. in the Gabrielsen Natatorium at
the Ramsey Center on the University of Georgia campus. The
championships conclude with finals beginning at 7 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After the first day, Georgia leads with 143.5. Following are:
SMU 137.5, Stanford 129, Southern Cal 93 and Arizona 90. Most
expect the three-day race for the team championship to be among
those teams.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Wimer, a member of SMU's winning 200-yard freestyle
relay team said the Lady Mustangs ``are off to a good start. We
have some good sprinters.''
</P>
<P>
   With Moravcova earning the right to stand at the top of the
podium twice, Georgia built its lead by earning a fourth-place
finish in the 200-yard freestyle relay, a fourth and sixth in the
200-yard individual medley, a fourth in the 500-yard freestyle and
a fourth in the 50-yard freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Bulldogs have depth on their side with 17 swimmers
competing in the championships. SMU has 11 and defending champion
Stanford 13.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches of the top five ranked schools expected this meet to
be fast and fourth-ranked SMU showed why very early.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Mustangs set a pool record in the first event in the
time trials in the 200-yard freestyle relay. That mark, 1:29.32,
lasted a handful of hours. SMU came back to make the mark faster
with a 1:28:94 to win the NCAA title in that event.
</P>
<P>
   That SMU win meant Moravcova, who swam the opening leg in 22:22,
was for a few minutes an 11-time NCAA champion. In less than a half
hour, she was back in the pool winning easily in the 200-yard
individual medley for her 12th title.
</P>
<P>
   Moravcova's 1:55.64 was the second-fastest 200-yard individual
medley in history, behind the time of 1:55.54 set by former
Stanford and U.S. Olympic swimmer Summer Sanders in 1992.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It went according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, the president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, arrived at Pennsylvania Station from
Washington shortly after 11 Thursday morning, looking like a
businessman eager to keep an appointment. There to greet him was
his host, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who had arranged for him to be
arrested in about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   As Sharpton's driver maneuvered the purple van downtown, the two
men talked about the matter at hand: the daily acts of civil
disobedience to protest last month's shooting death of an unarmed
African immigrant by four white police officers. Then the car phone
rang; it was an aide delivering a report from outside police
headquarters, the now-familiar scene of the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walk right up and start the pickets,'' Sharpton instructed.
``We're about five minutes away.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour and a thousand chants for justice later, 59 people were
arrested outside 1 Police Plaza on charges of disorderly conduct.
Among those led away in plastic handcuffs were Mfume and three
members of Harlem's black elite: state Sen. David Paterson; his
father, Basil Paterson, a former deputy mayor and New York
secretary of state, and former Manhattan Borough President Percy
Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   Standing shoulder-to-shoulder in crisp suits, just a few feet
from a revolving door to the glass and brick headquarters, the four
men made a striking image for the scrum of news photographers. Not
only did it bring to mind past acts of civil disobedience, from the
civil rights movement to protests against apartheid, but it also
underscored the arrests earlier this week, in the same spot, of
former Mayor David Dinkins and Rep. Charles Rangel.
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth day of daily acts of civil disobedience in
front of police headquarters, acts that have ended with people
detained for about an hour and then released.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters' demands are simply stated, if not simply
achieved, ranging from a residency requirement for all police
officers to the arrests of the four officers involved in the
shooting death of the immigrant from Guinea, Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the carefully scripted parade of celebrities in
handcuffs has drawn unflagging news coverage to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   And with each passing day, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani seems less
patient with the tradition of nonviolent protest, no matter how
civil. At a news conference held two hours before Thursday's
arrests, Giuliani mocked former Mayor Ed Koch for saying that he
might volunteer to be arrested, and suggested that the daily
protests were highly political and ``getting silly, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is getting to be a really abusive situation in
the sense of trying to use the police in ways that are highly
inappropriate,'' he said. ``I think they are over the top now. This
is the piling-on time where everybody is hoping, `Let me see if I
can get on camera.' And, unfortunately, you keep obliging them.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, organizers say, the mayor was also keeping to the
plan. By ridiculing civil disobedience, they say, he only
reinforces prevailing perceptions that he has no ties to or
understanding of the city's black residents, and that he is
predisposed to defend the police department no matter how egregious
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I follow the Muhammad Ali technique of rope-a-dope,'' Sharpton
said. ``I lay back and let the guy beat himself up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo case has created another tug-of-war between two men
whose history is so antagonistic that Giuliani often refuses to
utter Sharpton's name. The mayor has contended that the minister is
little more than a loud-mouthed media creation who lives to incite
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton countered that he has a significant following among
black New Yorkers, as the voting in his past political campaigns
has shown, even though they were unsuccessful. Sitting in the
Harlem office of his organization, the National Action Network, he
said that everyone from Cardinal John O'Connor to President Clinton
has met with him because everyone but the mayor recognizes him as a
leader. And, the minister added, Giuliani has underestimated him _
and all the other black leaders in the city that the mayor has
refused to meet _ at his own risk.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sharpton and others say, black and Hispanic residents have
been galvanized by two recent developments: the firing of 41
bullets at Diallo in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building
on Feb. 4, and the perception that Giuliani was too quick to defend
the police and too slow to mourn the young man's death. And they
say that the mayor's use of statistics _ including those that
suggest a growing restraint among the city's officers _ to
distinguish reality from misperception, shows that he is out of
touch with the experiences of young black men living in New York.
</P>
<P>
   After a few demonstrations, including one in the city's
financial district that led to Sharpton's arrest, coalitions began
to form among black leaders who do not always shared the same world
view. Then, late last month, the board of the National Action
Network gave Sharpton the go-ahead to organize sustained nonviolent
protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to find a tactic that all people can participate in
if they choose to,'' explained the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, one of
the organizers and the pastor of the House of the Lord Pentecostal
Church in Brooklyn. With civil disobedience, he added, ``Nobody is
hurt, and yet it makes the point.''

 NEW YORK: the point.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sharpton, his legal adviser, Michael Hardy, and others said that
a lot of planning went into the mechanics of the daily protests.
They considered several sites, including City Hall, before choosing
police headquarters. They wanted to avoid having the same people
arrested day after day, to demonstrate the widespread outrage over
the case. To expedite processing after arrests, they advise
participants to have photo identification and no outstanding
warrants, and they recently began providing the police with the
names of those about to be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, city officials say that Police Commissioner
Howard Safir _ and not Giuliani _ has handled the response to the
protests, although the mayor receives periodic updates. One Police
Plaza now sports rows of blue sawhorses that are used to corral the
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Before the events of Thursday, the protests had received the
most media attention on Monday, when Dinkins, Rangel and Sharpton
were arrested. The image of a former mayor and the dean of the
city's congressional delegation being led off in handcuffs angered
Koch, who said that such a decision had to have been made by the
mayor himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think an ordinary cop or even the police commissioner
would handcuff the highest black elected official for the state of
New York in Congress and a former mayor without checking with the
mayor?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Police Inspector Michael Collins said that the arresting
officers were simply following the policy laid out in the
department's patrol guide.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Roche, the mayor's press secretary, said that the mayor
played no role in that decision. In addition, Sharpton pointed out:
``It makes a dramatic picture. You don't hear me complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicity is part of the reason why prominent people in the city
have volunteered or been enlisted to be arrested. The other reason
is that they believe in the cause _ and, despite any past
differences _ in Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have chosen different paths'' on issues over the years,
Paterson, the state senator, said. ``But on this one, I think this
has been one of his absolutely best efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Bill Perkins, who was arrested earlier this
week, agreed: ``I think this thing could have been managed quite
differently. It could have been more inflammatory, much more
divisive. It could have been petty, and I don't think we see a
petty movement. We see a high-quality movement.''
</P>
<P>
   That movement, for now, is being run out of Sharpton's office,
where plaques on the wall are meant to prove his standing in the
community, and where a black-and-white portrait of Martin Luther
King Jr. gazes down at him. With a few minutes to spare before
leaving to meet Mfume at Penn Station, he answered the phone and
worked out details for protests to come.
</P>
<P>
   Friday has been named State Legislators Day at the protest,
Sharpton explained, with Assemblyman Keith Wright of Harlem and
others planning to be arrested. Monday is to be Lawyers Day,
although Dick Gregory is also planning to be arrested that day.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang. It was Dennis Rivera, the president of local
1199, the mammoth National Health and Human Services Employees
Union, calling to volunteer his services.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be wonderful,'' Sharpton answered, taking notes.
``Can you do that Wednesday. We can make that Labor Leaders Day.''

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Senate committee approved legislation Thursday
night to create a wide range of new rights for patients, but
Democrats said the protections fell far short of what was needed to
help people deal with insurance companies and health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The question of patients' rights stirs more public interest than
many issues before Congress, and Thursday's battle was only the
first stage of a conflict likely to continue into next year's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   By a party-line vote of 10-8, the panel, the Committee on
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, approved the bill and sent
it to the Senate floor. On the floor, Democrats will try to force
an open-ended debate on patients' rights and the techniques used by
HMOs to save money.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was written mainly by the committee chairman, Sen.
James Jeffords, R-Vt., and reflects the approach favored by most
Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time,'' Jeffords said, ``millions and millions
of people will have protections they did not have before.''
</P>
<P>
   The most significant provision of the bill would allow people in
employer-sponsored health plans to appeal decisions denying them
coverage for specific services. Patients could appeal to an
independent medical reviewer if a health plan refused to pay for
care on the ground that it was medically unnecessary or
experimental.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee rejected a Democratic amendment that would
have made it easier for many patients to sue HMOs and other health
plans under state law.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the senior Democrat on the
committee, repeatedly denounced the Republican bill as a sham,
saying it was full of loopholes and empty promises. ``If you have a
right without a remedy, you don't have a right,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill defines different rights for different
groups of people, depending on the nature and source of their
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said, for example, that the grievance and appeal
procedures required by their bill would be available to more than
120 million people with health benefits provided by employers. But
many of the other consumer protection standards would apply only to
a subset of this group _ 48 million people in health plans
regulated exclusively by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   These standards would require health plans to pay for emergency
care in any situation that a ``prudent lay person'' would regard as
an emergency. They would also prohibit health plans from
restricting what doctors tell patients about treatment options.
Doctors say some HMOs have enforced ``gag rules,'' forbidding
doctors to tell patients about expensive treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican bill, health plans would have to allow
patients to go directly to obstetricians, gynecologists and
pediatricians for routine care, without getting a referral or prior
approval from a family doctor or internist. For an extra charge,
consumers could buy coverage allowing them to use doctors outside
the network of physicians selected by their health plan.
</P>
<P>
   The House, which passed a patients' bill of rights last year by
a vote of 216-210, is working on similar legislation again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   After the impeachment of President Clinton, some politicians
predicted that Republicans and Democrats would cooperate to produce
tangible results on issues of concern to voters. But the guerrilla
warfare in the Senate committee over the last two days tends to
disprove that prediction. The disagreements involved not only big
questions, like the right to sue, but countless little details as
well.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Thursday, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said:
``This is pretty depressing. It's greed prevailing over need.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats suggested that Republicans were trying to protect the
interests of the insurance industry and employers. But an aide to
Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the assistant Republican leader, said:
``Insurers hate our bill, and we don't care. This wasn't written to
satisfy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers objected to some of the proposed new appeal rights for
patients. Paul Dennett, vice president of the Association of
Private Pension and Welfare Plans, which represents large
companies, said, ``Many good employers and insurance companies
allow external review, but it is by no means common practice yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans said they had limited the scope of many
provisions of their bill because they did not want to usurp the
states' authority to regulate insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy said the federal government needed to set minimum
nationwide standards because there were many gaps and
inconsistencies in state laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican bill leaves two-thirds of Americans out,''
Kennedy said. ``It leaves behind our nation's most vulnerable
health care consumers and patients _ the people who purchase
insurance by themselves without assistance from their employer, and
many of the people who work for small businesses.''

JETS NEAR DEAL THAT WOULD SEND FOLEY TO THE SEAHAWKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Minn., Ill.)   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glenn Foley's career as a New York Jets quarterback is days, if
not hours, from ending, but Foley may get in a trade what he could
no longer get with the Jets _ the chance to compete for a starting
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and the Seattle Seahawks are close to a deal that would
have Foley in the Seahawks' off-season passing camp next week
competing with the current starter, Jon Kitna, whose hold on the
job is tenuous under Mike Holmgren, Seattle's new coach.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Jets would receive a middle-round draft choice
from Seattle, with the slim possibility that the draft pick becomes
a higher one if Foley, 28, starts a majority of the Seahawks' games
next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets would also be free of Foley's $2.05 million annual
salary, giving the team valuable room under the salary cap as it
tries to fill other needs through free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the teams were discussing specific trade terms. The
Jets' bargaining position is limited, however, because it is
believed they will release Foley soon because a workout bonus
payment schedule begins on Monday. Foley is set to earn $10,000 for
each of the 40 off-season conditioning workouts the Jets will begin
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who was exposed but unclaimed during last month's
expansion draft for the Cleveland Browns, no longer fits into the
Jets' plans. Vinny Testaverde is the starter, and the Jets recently
signed Tom Tupa, a punter and quarterback. The Jets also have
quarterback Ray Lucas. If the Jets have any doubts that Lucas and
Tupa can handle the backup responsibilities, they can always sign a
veteran free agent later _ at considerably less than the $2 million
Foley would earn.
</P>
<P>
   Foley has indicated his first choice is Seattle, which has
unsuccessfully pursued several second-level quarterbacks this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Few teams have expressed interest in Foley, though Minnesota and
Chicago have made inquiries. Each of these teams, including
Seattle, could wait for the Jets to cut Foley next week and sign
him without having to compensate the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, the Jets' seventh-round choice in 1994, opened last
season as the starting quarterback following several injury-filled
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   When Foley hid a rib injury from Coach Bill Parcells during a
losing effort in the Jets' second game, Parcells began to sour on
Foley. By the sixth game, Parcells had switched to Testaverde. As
Testaverde led the Jets into the playoffs, Parcells also was irked
when Foley commented that hidden forces had led to his benching.
</P>
<P>
   Foley completed 58 of 108 passes for 749 yards with 4 touchdowns
and 6 interceptions before being replaced last season. He has never
thrown more than 110 passes in a season.

REPORT ON MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA BRINGS NEW FIGHT ON ZERO
TOLERANCE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long-awaited government-commissioned report on marijuana
that was issued on Wednesday may have concerned the drug's
medicinal uses, but it has also opened a debate into marijuana's
longstanding role as linchpin of a national policy of zero
tolerance toward illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing issues like whether marijuana was a gateway to the
use of harder drugs (the researchers found no convincing evidence
that it was), the report used language calculated not to overstep
the bounds of scientific inquiry into the arena of political
argument.
</P>
<P>
   But the very nature of the report was contrary to the
government's usual inclination against acknowledging any merit at
all in marijuana use, and advocates on both sides of the issue
seized on it.
</P>
<P>
   The authors _ 11 independent experts at the Institute of
Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of Sciences _ found that
marijuana smoke was even more toxic than tobacco smoke and could
cause cancer, lung damage and pregnancy complications.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they said, marijuana should be smoked only by those
patients in whom long-term effects are not of great concern, like
the terminally ill, and even then under tight control. Nonetheless,
they said, marijuana's active ingredients appear to be effective
for treating pain, nausea and the severe weight loss associated
with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which
ordered and financed the two-year study after voters in California
and Arizona endorsed medicinal use of marijuana in 1996
referendums, has had little comment on the report beyond endorsing
its call for further research, saying science alone should
determine what is safe and effective medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But other marijuana opponents have been more outspoken. ``The
only issue from a policy point of view is whether smoked marijuana
is a viable medicine for the treatment for anything, and the report
virtually says no, which is very important,'' said Dr. Robert
DuPont, clinical professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University
Medical School. ``People don't go to their pharmacy and get a
prescription for burning leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, advocates of a more liberal approach to drugs
see the report as a catalyst to force the government to rethink its
zero-tolerance policy. ``The release of this report is the
beginning of a process, not the end,'' said Bill Zimmerman,
executive director of Americans for Medical Rights, which has
sponsored medicinal-marijuana initiatives in a dozen states. ``It
will provoke all kinds of activity across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's longtime position _ that marijuana is a
dangerous drug that cannot be tolerated any more than cocaine or
heroin _ has not been helped by the fact that as many as 60 million
Americans, including President Clinton, have tried it, most with no
significant aftereffect. Further, the government's policy has been
predicated on the assumption that smoking marijuana can lead
nowhere but to the abuse of harder drugs, an outlook that the
authors contradicted.
</P>
<P>
   Medical marijuana was chosen as a wedge issue several years ago
by people who wanted to move drug policy in a softer direction,
said Mark A.R. Kleiman, professor of public policy at the
University of California at Los Angeles. Government officials could
have neutralized the issue, Kleiman said, by agreeing to strictly
medical use of the drug, but instead ``they had to be against
marijuana for any use, and as a result they handed a wonderful
issue to their opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the government's opposition to medicinal use ``is one
of the most readily comprehensible excesses of the war on drugs,''
said Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith Center, which
promotes liberalized alternatives to current drug policy. ``It's
one that most Americans understand: that arresting patients is not
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, see a freewheeling public debate about medicinal
marijuana as a slippery slope that can only lead to acceptance of
the drug's recreational use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that is going to make marijuana use by adolescents a
more likely event is going to be a terrible blow to the efforts we
are making to remedy the problem of raising children in America,''
said Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, president of Phoenix House, the
nationwide network of drug treatment centers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, one of 13 experts who reviewed the report
for the Institute of Medicine before its release, said it set high
standards for justifying the medicinal use of marijuana. But
Kleber, medical director of the National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse at Columbia University, also called the report
``that kind of thing where people can take sound bites to bolster
whatever position they want.''

NCAA CAN'T WIN IN COURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who's representing the NCAA in court these days, the Los Angeles
District Attorney?
</P>
<P>
   First, it lost $54 million in the restricted-earnings lawsuit
filed by assistant coaches. Last week, a federal judge struck down
the use of minimum standardized test scores to determine freshman
eligibility. Now, the Black Coaches Association has challenged the
NCAA to improve its minority hiring or _ what else? _ face legal
action.
</P>
<P>
   No issue packs the power of U.S. District Court Judge Ronald
Buckwalter's ruling that Proposition 16, which uses SAT and ACT
scores to determine eligibility, was unfair to African-Americans.
Studies show African-Americans consistently score lower on
standardized tests than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Before Buckwalter's ruling, incoming freshmen needed to score at
least 820 on the SAT (out of 1600) for initial eligibility. Now,
athletes will be eligible as freshmen with a 500 SAT, for instance,
as long as they have the necessary grade-point average in core
courses.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA can't win. It created the eligibility standards in 1986
in response to complaints it was exploiting athletes who couldn't
handle legitimate college work. Now, those standards are
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pac-10 and across the nation, Buckwalter's ruling favors
schools that lack a strong commitment to admissions standards, like
Washington State, Arizona and Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   On the local front, both UCLA and USC say they'll maintain
current standards. If true, they'll face a competitive
disadvantage, unable to admit players who are accepted elsewhere.
(Of course, the massive talent base in Southern California offsets
any discrepancies in admissions.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge's ruling opens the oor for schools with lower
admissions standards while other schools maintain higher
standards,'' said USC's Fred Stroock, special assistant to the
athletic director. ``The level playing field the NCAA seeks is
disappearing pretty rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckwalter denied the NCAA's request for a stay, leaving the
member schools with no guidelines until the association develops
new eligibility standards. That could take months.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sitting tight and waiting for the NCAA to say what
direction to take,'' said Mike Matthews, the Pac-10's assistant
director for compliance and enforcement. ``The NCAA isn't advising
schools to do one thing or another. There simply is no
initial-eligibility rule right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It may take six weeks or six months, but eventually the NCAA
will institute new guidelines. Most likely, they'll follow the
former standards as closely as possible within Buckwalter's
parameters. He did not outlaw the use of standardized tests in
general; he outlawed the use of standardized tests as a limiting
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Stroock thinks the new model may expand the sliding-scale format
that was adopted several years ago, in which low SAT scores require
a high GPA, and vice versa. In the new model, a 400 SAT would
require a 3.0 GPA, and a 500 SAT would require a 2.9 GPA, and so
on. That would fit Buckwalter's demands, since incorporating the
lowest score possible (400) eliminates the minimizing aspect of the
SAT.
</P>
<P>
   This much is sure: The new system cannot rely solely on GPA;
high schools have different grading scales and systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very complex issue, and there's no simple solution,''
said Stroock, who spent eight years at UCLA before moving downtown.
``When eligibility issues have come up in the past, there's been no
consensus agreement, just majority agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's majority confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Rise of the lower seeds: Five teams in the Sweet 16 are seeded
ninth or lower _ making this the most upset-filled tournament since
the field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Never before had four low
seeds advanced to the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors help account for the upsets _ the scholarship
reductions (from 15 to 13), which disperse talent, and the flight
of top players to the NBA, which has weakened the heavyweights not
named Duke.
</P>
<P>
   If North Carolina had Vince Carter and Antawn Jamison, if
Arizona had Mike Bibby, if Kansas had Paul Pierce, perhaps someone
would be worthy of the Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the week: Ohio State forward George Reese on his first
encounter with husky-voiced coach Jim O'Brien: ``I thought he was a
gangster. I thought, `You must be related to the Gambinos.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Friday fodder: If Nevada-Las Vegas is found guilty of NCAA
violations _ the latest allegations involve an assistant coach
using a student manager to make car payments for ex-Rebel Tyrone
Nesby _ and if coach Billy Bayno loses his job, here's a name to
consider: John Thompson. The former Georgetown coach loves Las
Vegas and is often spotted at casinos playing the slots.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to be Tark: Fresno State coach Jerry Tarkanian, who
also experienced bouts with NCAA violations while coaching at UNLV,
has signed a one-year contract extension despite failing to make
the NCAA Tournament in any of his four seasons. His players have
had a slew of legal problems, including that small matter f point
shaving.
</P>
<P>
   Incoming Cardinal: Stanford has strengthened a brilliant
recruiting class with the additions of Alameda St. Joseph's-Notre
Dame power forward Justin Davis, who UCLA wanted desperately, and
Tyler Besecker, a gifted 6-6 walk-on from Mercer Island (Wash.). &QL;

A. DOAK BARNETT, CHINA SCHOLAR, DIES AT 77  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ind., N.C.)   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur Doak Barnett, a leading scholar and government adviser on
China, died on Monday at Georgetown Hospital in Washington. He was
77. The cause was respiratory failure, the family said, and friends
said he also had lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Born to missionary parents in Shanghai in 1921, Barnett, who
used his middle name, was among the most prolific writers about
Chinese affairs. But he was best known for working behind the
scenes in Congress and the executive branch to improve relations
between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His influence always seemed to be greater than indicated by his
official positions, which included a long stint at the Brookings
Institution in Washington and teaching posts at Columbia and Johns
Hopkins universities.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently he ran a salon on China policy that moved from
his living room in McLean, Va., to those of other participants,
including analysts from the Central Intelligence Agency, academic
specialists and current and former ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 he was the principal witness for an extensive review of
China policy conducted by Sen. J. William Fulbright, chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. At the time China was
regarded as an implacable enemy of the United States, a supporter
of the North Vietnamese war effort and a virulent force seeking to
topple democratic governments like so many dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett quietly encouraged both President Lyndon B. Johnson and
President Richard M. Nixon to end China's isolation. It was Barnett
who coined the formula ``containment without isolation'' to
describe a diplomatic opening that still recognized China's danger.
</P>
<P>
   The Fulbright hearings are thought to have influenced Nixon, who
wrote the following year in the journal Foreign Affairs, ``Taking
the long view, we simply cannot afford to leave China forever
outside the family of nations, there to nurture its fantasies,
cherish its hates and threaten its neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last May, Barnett recalled debating the merits
of improving relations with China in a private meeting between
Nixon and China scholars in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt that Nixon was the guy, because of his
background,'' Barnett said, referring to Nixon's conservative
credentials. ``I am not sure the Democrats would have been capable
of taking a major step toward China because of the fear of being
clobbered.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Democrats tried, and even Johnson flirted with an
overture to China, in July 1967, after the Fulbright hearings.
``There was a rising tide in the country that the time had come for
re-examination on China,'' said Jerome A. Cohen, a scholar of
Chinese law and one of Barnett's colleagues. ``It was in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the opening to China in 1972, as the pendulum of
public attitudes toward China has swung from buoyant goodwill to
harsh criticism of Chinese human rights policies, Barnett has been
there offering government officials insight, analysis and advice _
after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre and again when the Clinton
administration clashed with China in 1993 over human rights and
weapons proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years in Washington, he was the institutional memory
that the State Department did not have,'' said Ezra F. Vogel, a
sociologist at Harvard University and a former analyst of Asian
affairs for the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Barnett remained confident that the tally of
common interests between China and the United States was greater
than the points of contention.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago, one of the Clinton administration's leading
China experts, Kenneth W. Lieberthal, was in Barnett's hospital
room to visit, but also to commiserate over increasing tensions
with Beijing over allegations that China had stolen nuclear design
secrets from the Los Alamos laboratories in New Mexico and over
China's poor record on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal, a former graduate student under Barnett at Columbia,
said that when he entered the hospital room, all Barnett wanted to
talk about was China and the current ``nose dive'' in relations. He
counseled that the administration should maintain a long-term
perspective because the rising level of commerce and other
interaction would hold the relationship together.
</P>
<P>
   When Lieberthal got up to leave, Barnett said, ``I've got to
tell you, Ken, I am still cautiously optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   During his academic career, Barnett wrote or edited more than 20
books about China, and in the prologue to his 1993 study of four
decades of change in ``China's Far West,'' he wrote that despite
his extensive knowledge of China, ``I am less impressed by what I
have learned over the years than about what I still must learn to
understand China.'' In an era of pundits and instant experts,
Barnett was refreshingly humbled by his subject.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview last year, just as Clinton was preparing
for his first trip to China, Barnett lamented the fact that the
administration had lurched about on China policy so much that
``there is still no political framework on which anyone can
articulate a policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said such a framework would only come from a ``strong
president who takes the leadership responsibility to mobilize
support and deal with Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett was the son of Eugene and Bertha Barnett. His father was
working in China for the Young Men's Christian Association and the
family did not return to the United States until 1936. The young
Barnett graduated summa cum laude from Yale University in 1942,
with a degree in international relations. He spent World War II in
the Marine Corps, advancing from private to lieutenant while
serving stateside and in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a master's degree in international relations at Yale
and a certificate from the Yale Institute of Far Eastern Languages
in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   That year he went back to Asia as a fellow of the Institute of
Current World Affairs, and as a correspondent for The Daily News of
Chicago, he chronicled the devastation of the Chinese civil war,
which pitted Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalists against Mao's
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett stayed in Asia until 1950, when almost all foreigners
were pushed out of China at the outset of the Korean War. But it
was that journey, and a return tour in 1988, that provided the
material for his 1993 book on the country's western provinces, the
area of China that is least known to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1950-51, Barnett served as a public affairs officer in the
American Consulate in Hong Kong, helping to analyze China's
internal politics and draft recommendations for propaganda
campaigns. Beginning in 1952, he spent four years as an associate
of the American Universities Field Staff in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Vogel said Barnett, as a program director for the Ford
Foundation in Hong Kong in the late 1950s, channeled substantial
funds to research projects on China at a time when many foundations
did not want to because of the hostile politics of the McCarthy
era.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett held teaching and consulting positions at the State
Department Foreign Service Institute, Syracuse University, the
National Planning Association and the Ford Foundation before
accepting a professorship at Columbia in 1961.
</P>

JUDGES TURN BACK CHALLENGE TO INQUIRY OF STARR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (Eds: See also MCDOUGAL-TRIAL)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court on Thursday dismissed an
effort by a private legal group to halt the Justice Department's
inquiry into possible misconduct by the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The special three-judge panel that selects independent counsels
rejected a challenge from the Landmark Legal Foundation, a
conservative law group based in Virginia that sought to block the
inquiry on the grounds that the department lacked the authority to
discipline independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   It was uncertain Thursday what impact, if any, the court's
ruling would have on the department's inquiry. Before Landmark
sought to intervene, Attorney General Janet Reno and Starr had
agreed to negotiate a framework for the inquiry into his
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial panel's primary role is to select the independent
counsel and define the scope of the inquiry after the attorney
general decides an inquiry is required under the law.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the panel acknowledged the limited scope of its
own authority under the law. The panel's unsigned opinion said,
``We have no jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the panel said Landmark could not show how it had
suffered any ``concrete and actual or imminent injury'' because of
the Justice Department's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will focus on whether Starr's prosecutors
improperly coerced witnesses like Monica Lewinsky or withheld
information from the department's lawyers about possible conflicts
of interest at the outset of the Lewinsky inquiry in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The court decision was one of two events Thursday involving
Starr and the entangling legal issues his investigation has
engendered.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress has only just begun deliberations over whether
to renew the law that provides for the appointment of independent
prosecutors, some Democratic senators tried to insure that whatever
happens, Starr would be out of business by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and a handful of other Democrats
tried and failed to have the Senate vote to shut down Starr's
operations by Dec. 31 and to have any outstanding investigations
turned over to the Justice Department to complete.
</P>
<P>
   The motion was criticized even by some Democrats and was
defeated by a voice vote so resounding that Torricelli did not even
make the customary request for a roll-call vote.
</P>
<P>
   The brief consideration of Torricelli's amendment Thursday was a
foretaste of the looming debate over whether to renew the
independent counsel law, which is set to expire on June 30. It is
expected that Congress will allow the law to lapse.

 By JANE WOLFE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When Sara M. Dunham regularly drives the seven hours
from her home in Baton Rouge, La., to spend about $200,000 a year
at the flagship Neiman Marcus store here, her rewards go beyond the
clothing, jewelry and furs she buys.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of In Circle, the Neiman Marcus frequent-shopper
club, she and her husband will be treated this year to a free week
in Milan, with first-class flights and hotels. Last year, it was
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But now Mrs. Dunham's loyalty may be tested. Other high-end
retailers, especially Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman, which
like Neiman Marcus is a unit of Harcourt General, are also trying
to lure shoppers like her. The new competition has meant enhanced
loyalty programs with more perks like special discounts, trips
abroad and exclusive social events inside and outside the stores.
</P>
<P>
   The retailers say the programs show how important those shoppers
are to them. ``Neiman's, Saks, and Bergdorf's all go after the
richest 2 percent of the nation's people,'' says Howard L.
Davidowitz, a New York retail consultant. ``You're shooting for a
class of people who spend $6,000 for a dress. You have to coddle
these people constantly because you cannot afford to lose even a
few of them as customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Which program is best? It depends on whether a shopper wants
merchandise discounts or other goodies. The value of the bonuses
usually ranges from 1 percent to, at higher levels, 6 percent of
the amount spent. Because most programs require use of the
retailers' own charge cards _ or special, affiliated cards _
shoppers should also compare their terms, interest rates and
rewards with those of other credit cards, some of which offer
frequent-flier miles or other rewards of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The latest retailer to join the fight is Bergdorf Goodman.
Hoping for quick gains, Bergdorf's, unlike Neiman's and Saks, will
allow customers to earn award points on any credit card, although
its own card will earn twice the points.
</P>
<P>
   Saks, meanwhile, is making its biggest splash among the
designer-label set with its four-year-old Platinum Events, each
more lavish than the last. Last month, 40 Platinum members, who
spend at least $10,000 a year, and their spouses or friends, dined
on leeks with caviar, lobster-filled zucchini blossoms and rack of
lamb with gingered eggplant at Chanterelle.
</P>
<P>
   In attendance were Philip B. Miller, the Saks chief executive,
and Donna Karan, who told the guests that she would be in the
flagship store the next day to help them design their wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman's offer their members shopping
nights when the stores are closed to everyone but them. They are
feted with cocktails and food and have a chance to chat with
designers and executives. At Neiman's events, there is another
bonus: double In Circle points.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty programs are also offered by chains like Bloomingdale's,
a unit of Federated Department Stores; Marshall Field's, a unit of
Dayton Hudson, and Nordstrom. The plans can provide discounts or
gift certificates for users of the stores' charge cards or
affiliated Visa cards.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard G. Barlow, publisher of the Colloquy newsletter,
which tracks frequent-buyer and traveler programs, says these other
plans, which require just $500 or $1,000 of purchases, are not
snobbish enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make the customer feel important, you've got to be
exclusive,'' Barlow said. ``Neiman's realized before anyone else
that since so many stores have the same merchandise, it's no longer
sufficient to focus on what you sell but rather on who is buying
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The retailers disagree over how shoppers want to be rewarded.
Members of the Saks First program, who must spend a minimum of
$2,000, get points redeemable only at Saks. ``We did extensive
research that showed our customers really did not want trips,''
said Sheri Wilson-Gray, marketing vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, serious shoppers appreciate some things that they can't
secure themselves. ``Even if you have great wealth,'' Ms.
Wilson-Gray said, ``it's not necessarily within your power to call
up Donna Karan and say, `Will you personally help me create my
spring wardrobe?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Neiman's In Circle was inspired by AAdvantage, the American
Airlines frequent-flier program; American started it in 1981,
shortly after moving to Dallas. ``Since they were in our own
backyard, we were watching them very closely,'' said Billy J.
Payton, Neiman's marketing vice president. ``We knew that
recognizing and rewarding customers based on spending was driving
market share in the airline industry and we were trying to develop
the same kind of program.''
</P>
<P>
   In Circle, founded in 1984, gives one award point for each
dollar spent. It has grown to 150,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Like the airlines' frequent-flier programs, the stores' plans
encourage the notion that spending in the pursuit of ostensibly
free awards is downright thrifty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My secretary was reading my Neiman's statement and said to me,
`You're just $200 short of getting the award for 3,000 American
Airlines points,' '' said Nancy O. Lemmon, a civic and social
leader here. ``So I raced down to Neiman's and spent more than $200
for a sweater and got the points.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who spend $100,000 can choose tickets to the Super Bowl or
the Kentucky Derby, including first-class airline tickets and hotel
rooms. Spend a million and get a Jaguar S-Type, or a one-week
annual stay for life (and for the life of your children) at the
Four Seasons Punta Mita resort near Puerto Vallarta on Mexico's
west coast, or one million frequent flier points.
</P>
<P>
   At her award level, Mrs. Dunham has missed a trip only one year
in the history of In Circle, when she was in a hospital. Neiman's
sent over a food spread that included its chicken soup.

MAN ASSERTS TRUCKER TRIED TO PASS GATES BEFORE CRASH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A possible witness has come forward in the deadly
crash of an Amtrak train and a truck on Monday night in
Bourbonnais, Ill., and a federal official said Thursday night that
the man told investigators he saw the truck driver try to snake
through the lowered crossing gates.
</P>
<P>
   The man called Amtrak on Wednesday, saying he was driving a car
behind the truck. Federal investigators did not say why he did not
come forward earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A federal safety official in Washington familiar with the
investigation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the
motorist had told investigators that he saw the truck go around the
gates.
</P>
<P>
   At the crash site, John Goglia, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board, said, ``We need to analyze what this
person saw and see how it fits with the other facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The work of identifying the dead passengers on the train, the
City of New Orleans, moved forward. The coroner of Kankakee County,
James Orrison, said he had 11 bodies, and that most had been
identified from medical records. Orrison said he believed the 11
matched Amtrak's list of passengers unaccounted for. He said he
would release the names on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, investigators, after re-enacting the conditions
at the time of the crash, said the truck driver might have snaked
his load of steel around crossing gates after waiting as long as 21
seconds when lights began to flash and he saw no train.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board officials said preliminary tests showed that the
truck and train were not perpendicular when the crash occurred,
suggesting the truck was moving around the gates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, John R. Stokes, 58, from nearby Manteno, Ill.,
has repeatedly told investigators that he did not drive around the
gates, but was in the crossing when he saw the signal lights and
the oncoming train. Officials are testing his account by studying
tire tracks at the crossing.
</P>
<P>
   The re-enactment on Wednesday night offered several important
pieces of evidence, investigators said. At the same hour as the
crash, approximately 9:50 p.m., they placed a similar locomotive on
the rails approaching Bourbonnais. On McKnight Road, where it
crosses the tracks next to a steel mill, they drove a tractor
pulling a flatbed truck loaded with steel.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found that the crossing gates were working
properly. Warning lights are intended to flash, and bells ring,
when a train is about 27 seconds from the crossing. Gates are then
lowered.
</P>
<P>
   The tests showed that the driver could not have seen the train's
headlight until it was 644 feet from the crossing, the
investigators said. With the train traveling the maximum 79 miles
per hour, the driver would have seen the train for at most 5.6
seconds before it reached the crossing.
</P>
<P>
   That calculation means the driver could have been waiting for as
long as 21 seconds after the lights flashed, before he could see a
train, said Robert Lauby, director of railroad safety for the
safety board. Too many drivers, officials said, will interpret that
interval as a sign that no train is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``What difference does it make when he can see the train?''
asked Jack Burke, a spokesman for the Illinois Central Railroad,
which maintains the crossing and owns the tracks over which Amtrak
operates the City of New Orleans. ``The gates are down. The lights
are flashing. The 26 seconds is there for traffic on the tracks to
clear, not for you to try to beat the train.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they also found that the truck could have
zigzagged its way around the crossing gates without hitting the
gates.
</P>
<P>
   Also, investigators learned that it is common for the gates at
that crossing to be triggered by freight cars on side rails, a
railroad official said. Drivers at the steel mill, Burke said, may
have become accustomed to false alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it could take nine to 12 months to determine
a cause.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The only witnesses known before Thursday were the truck driver
and the Amtrak engineer.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer, whose name has not been made public, did not
suffer serious injuries but remains sedated in a hospital in
Kankakee. An Amtrak board member has said that the engineer said he
saw the truck drive around the gates, but the federal investigators
have been unable to interview the engineer.
</P>
<P>
   While the investigators prepare to go home, 22 of the 116 people
injured remain in hospitals. A total of 216 passengers and crew
members were on the train, Amtrak said.

GOING TO BAT WITH A DREAM AND A PATENT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Minn., Ill.)   (af)  
 By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ I thought I was a boy until I turned 12,''
recalls Pamela Ryan, 42, inventor and mother of three girls. ``I'd
wanted to be a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, as Rosie the Riveter's granddaughters take to the
playing fields, such dreams no longer sound so farfetched. And in
part to support her daughters in the sport of their choice, Ms.
Ryan has developed and marketed a batter's helmet for women.
</P>
<P>
   The helmet, made with a special ``channel'' to accommodate a
ponytail, is one of five finalists in the 1999 Nasdaq/Amex Sports
Product of the Year contest.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing of the helmets demonstrates how serving the
evolving needs of girls and women can create new business
opportunities. It also reflects _ and benefits from _ the nation's
growing concern with preventing head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Since Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 barred sexual
discrimination at schools receiving federal funds, the playing
fields have been made fully accessible to girls and young women.
</P>
<P>
   There also has been a major shift at the professional level. The
Women's National Basketball Association and the American Basketball
League have started up, and women's team sports were spotlighted at
the last two Olympics. Ms. Ryan herself is now a member of the
Women's Sports Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group based in East
Meadow, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Mankato, Minn., Pam Ryan, nee Sheehan, wasn't just
dreaming about winning a Super Bowl ring; she wanted to ``put
something on the shelf that didn't exist before.''
</P>
<P>
   Her epiphany came in 1983 when she and her husband, Michael,
were coaching the softball team of the oldest of their three
daughters, who was then 6. ``It was ridiculous,'' Ms. Ryan said.
``There were so many equipment problems _ the bats were too heavy;
the helmets were too big and didn't fit right. The girls couldn't
just stand up and concentrate on hitting the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But she temporarily benched her musings on athletic equipment
while she raised her girls and completed her political science
degree at the University of St. Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   As her girls grew and became more active in sports, Ms. Ryan
decided that a good place to start was with helmets. ``I don't
think there is a man out there who understands what it's like to
wear a ponytail under a helmet unless he's had long hair himself,''
Ms. Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   She was driven to action when, in 1992, during her work as a
legislative lobbyist for the Washington-based American Plastics
Council, she happened across a study showing that girls who are
athletes use less alcohol and drugs than nonathletes, become
sexually active two to four years later and are more likely to
graduate from college.
</P>
<P>
   It took Ms. Ryan four years to refine her ideas and have helmet
prototypes made by a local company. ``I was constantly having my
daughters and their friends run around the backyard testing
helmets,'' she said. ``They got very tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Next she applied for a patent, an expensive and time-consuming
process with no guarantees. ``The smartest thing I ever did was to
hire an excellent patent attorney,'' she said. ``I got what I paid
for.'' She received her patent in 1996, which she promptly framed
and hung up at home.
</P>
<P>
   While the patent was pending, she formed a company, Designer
Sports, to develop her business. ``I researched manufacturing the
helmet myself and found that with the phenomenal amount of
insurance needed for head-injury liability it was impossible,'' she
said. So she instead approached sports equipment dealers to secure
a licensing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ryan arrived at meetings armed with statistics and Ross
Perot-style pie charts to demonstrate the size of the market. One
showed that seven million girls ages 7 to 17 play organized
softball. By law, they must all wear head protection. Another
display showed a sharp decline of injuries among players with
helmets.
</P>
<P>
   The response, she said, depended on the audience. ``When I
pitched the helmet to men, they'd just look at the ponytail channel
and go, `huh?' '' she said. But when she showed it to women
athletes, she added, ``they'd say, `I can't believe we don't have
these.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After a dozen rejections, Ms. Ryan finally clicked with Schutt
Sports of Litchfield, Ill., one of the nation's top equipment
makers and a big supplier of women's softball gear, with whom she
now has a licensing deal.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Ms. Ryan received her first royalty check. And
by the time her next one arrives _ it's due this week _ she expects
to recoup her start-up costs. Since June, more than 15,000 of the
$15 helmets have been sold, through sporting goods outlets across
the country and an ``800'' number, exceeding Schutt Sports'
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Her patent, which runs for 17 more years, is broad enough to let
her extend the basic model into other sports. Coming soon is a
helmet for girls ice hockey, to be followed, perhaps, by a similar
helmet for the ski slopes and one for soccer.
</P>
<P>
   To further encourage the sale and wearing of her helmets, Ms.
Ryan has them made in 5 styles and 14 colors, including teal and
purple. ``My goal,'' she said, ``is to get more girls involved in
sports by making comfortable equipment that not only fits properly
but looks cool.''

SILICON VALLEY'S AWESOME LOOK AT NEW SONY TOY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.Y., Calif.)   (af)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ On a giant video screen, a lifelike rubber
duck splashed about in a bathtub fleeing from a pursuing submarine.
Suddenly the drain opened and both were swept into the resulting
whirlpool.
</P>
<P>
   What made this demonstration Thursday by the Sony Corp. notable
was that the scene, rendered with almost perfect realism down to
each reflection in each ripple in the tub, was not a movie but an
interactive video game that signaled a new level of computing power
for everyday consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's Playstation II, though still more than a year away from
store shelves, is creating a stir here in Silicon Valley because it
is the first machine to deliver graphics that until now could be
produced only by supercomputers _ and at prices that will put it
under Christmas trees in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Shown for the first time in the United States, to 1,000 software
game developers, the machine suggested that the state of the art in
computing is moving from the aisles of CompuUSA to the shelves of
Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   Playstation II, which Sony says it expects to sell for
substantially less than $500, is perhaps the most striking example
yet of a coming generation of powerful computer processors that are
not designed for traditional computers. Instead, they are
engineered to concentrate all their considerable power on
performing highly specialized tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The new Sony machine will not process text or calculate a
budget, but it will take a generation of youngsters to the
threshhold of virtual reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you're seeing is the transition from people
playing video games to a world where we will create our own
fantasies in cyberspace,'' said Larry Smarr, director of the
National Center for Supercomputer Applications, in
Champaign-Urbana, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Playstation II was developed by Sony and the Toshiba Corp. in a
joint venture that adds up to an estimated $2 billion gamble on the
future of consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Though the two companies are playing down speculation that their
new chip could catapult them into competition with makers of
personal computer hardware and software, many opportunities are
obviously ahead for a machine that generates graphics at more than
twice the speed of the most powerful engineering work stations.
</P>
<P>
   The brain of Playstation II is a microprocessor that the two
companies have dubbed the Emotion Engine. It is designed to draw
tens of millions of tiny polygons, the building blocks of computer
graphics, on a television screen every second.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it renders animated graphics with the realism of
the movie ``Toy Story'' but in what is known as ``real time.'' That
is, it creates movement, characters and entire environments on the
fly in response to the movement of a joystick or other gaming
device.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony is clearly riding on a consumer mandate and delivering
supercomputer graphics,'' said Richard Doherty, president of
Envisioneering, a computer industry consulting firm in Seaford,
N.Y. ``People will buy the Playstation II just to get at the
chip.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony executives said they intended the name Emotion Engine to
convey the hope that game developers will use the chip's power to
create virtual worlds rich in subtlety and nuance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that you will go beyond driving and shooting and
killing people,'' Phil Harrison, a vice president at Sony Computer
Entertainment executive, told the developers. ``We are looking for
a new generation of software that has the same impact on a person
as a great book or a great movie.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new processor had enough power to begin to convey
humanlike motions and abilities, ranging from natural movement and
facial expressions to artificial intelligence like the ability to
learn and to recognize speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Emotion Engine is the most recent example of a reversal
under way in technological development. For decades, the most
advanced consumer electronics were technologies that trickled down
from the world of supercomputing, the Departments of Defense and
Energy and NASA.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That process has been turned on its head, mostly by the
economics of the consumer electronics industry, which has evolved
from a beneficiary of cutting-edge computer engineering to its
driving force.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, increasingly powering computer
products have begun showing up first in consumer applications. For
graphics and related multimedia processing, for example, the the
Emotion Engine is significantly more powerful than the Intel
Corp.'s newest Pentium III microprocessor and has more than twice
the graphics power of the most powerful Silicon Graphics work
station, the benchmark for graphics computing power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, benchmarks and flashy graphics do not guarantee success in
a computer. Indeed, Silicon Valley is littered with news releases
from companies that promised to shake up the world with ever-faster
computers. The vast majority failed to leave the laboratory and
``auger in'' to the market, in local parlance.
</P>
<P>
   The Emotion Engine is unlikely to suffer that fate, if only
because of the market muscle behind its developers. Still,
production in quantity must await the completion of a state-of-the
art semiconductor plant that Sony and Toshiba expect to go on line
next year.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, some analysts questioned Sony's announcing
Playstation II before it is available. It will arrive on the market
later than its main competition, the Sega Dreamcast machine, which
was recently introduced in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Sony executives went to some pains Thursday to assert that their
new machine was not a competitor to Wintel, the combination of the
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system and Intel's Pentium
microprocessors that dominates the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things the PC does really well, such as
running as a server and displaying Powerpoint slides,'' said
Harrison, the Sony Computer Entertainment executive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company has given every indication that it envisions
a new computing world that has little to do with the office
desktop. In this world, brilliant graphics and
mathematics-intensive tasks like voice recognition will matter
most. And it is in this world, Harrison said, that the Emotion
Engine will excel.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear to computer designers that the potential for
Sony's computer is enormous because its graphics power will be
coupled with high-speed connections to the Internet through cable
and satellite links.
</P>
<P>
   While company executives were coy about that possibility, they
did announce that the Playstation II would incorporate ports for
the two fastest communications channels available today _ Firewire
and the Universal Serial Bus.
</P>
<P>
   It is also noteworthy that the machine will ship with the
industry-standard slots for connecting peripherals like modems,
network cards, hard drives and flash memory to laptop computers.
Firewire is evolving as the standard for connecting a new
generation of digital video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   These features could make Sony a powerful competitor to
Microsoft if software developers begin to abandon the personal
computer platform when creating their newest and most advanced
applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This machine heralds the merger of film, television and the
video game businesses,'' said Stewart A. Halpern, a Wall Street
analyst at ING Baring Furman Selz.
</P>
<P>
   Others are already looking to take Playstation II beyond games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first credible alternative to the PC for reaching
people on the Internet,'' said Carl Malamud, chairman of Invisible
Worlds, an Internet software company in Redwood City, Calif.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department released internal documents
Thursday evening showing that it had concluded that a senior
diplomat, who is the new special envoy to the Balkans, did not lie
to Congress about death squads in Haiti. But the agency admonished
him for not giving complete testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the diplomat, James Dobbins, last October, the
department's personnel office said he had testified in ``good
faith,'' and that his answers to the House Committee on
International Relations three years ago were ``technically
correct.'' But the personnel office concluded that he ``may have
demonstrated poor judgment'' and was ``not responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Dobbins was issued a ``letter of admonishment,''
which is not considered a formal disciplinary action, will not be
placed in his file and will be destroyed after one year.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel office acted after reviewing a report by the State
Department's inspector general. The inspector general accused
Dobbins of giving testimony that was ``incomplete, misleading and
possibly perjurious,'' and of failing to exercise the integrity
expected of a senior executive branch officer, according to a
two-page unclassified summary of the inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the inspector general's office and
personnel bureau had reached such divergent views about Dobbins'
testimony. The inspector general's office could not be reached for
comment Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The problems for Dobbins, who has recently been named the State
Department's special envoy to the Balkans, arose out of testimony
he gave to a congressional committee looking at the Clinton
administration's Haiti policy.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the testimony, he was asked numerous
questions about an FBI investigation into the murder of a prominent
conservative Haitian, Mireille Durocher Bertin. There were
allegations that she had been killed by officials in the government
of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who had the support of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question from Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., Dobbins
said he had not been formally briefed by the FBI, and that the
agency was still conducting its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   This answer was ``truthful but not responsive,'' a deputy
assistant secretary for personnel, Janice Bay, said in the letter
of admonishment.

 Column: Keep Mum About Evil Former Boss
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I recently resigned from my job in the accounting field.
I was working for a very difficult boss. After years of trying to
get along with her, I decided it would be in my best interest to
leave the company. Now that I'm job hunting, how honest should I be
about the reason I quit? What should I say when prospective
employers ask me why I left my old job?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Here's how much bad stuff you should say about a
former boss when you're job hunting: Zero. Zip. Nada.
</P>
<P>
   You never know. Maybe the person interviewing you is the
next-door neighbor of your old boss whom you've just described as
an inept boob. Maybe they're best friends from college.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the interviewer is just thinking, ``Hmm, if this person
is saying all these negative things about their last boss, what
will they say someday about ME?''
</P>
<P>
   A bad boss may have been the main reason you left your job, but
it probably wasn't the only reason. When asked why you left, focus
on the other reasons _ and emphasize the positive ones. Maybe you
wanted some new challenges. Maybe you wanted to gain new skills.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Mandel, counseling director at Alumnae Resources in San
Francisco, suggests shifting the focus to why you want to work at
the firm you're visiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where doing research on companies is important,''
Mandel said. ``You can say, `I'm applying because I really consider
you a leader in the community banking field.'''
</P>
<P>
   If discussing your old job is stressful, consider practicing
your response. Mandel has had clients who couldn't answer questions
about their old job without breaking into tears. That doesn't sound
like your situation; but it still couldn't hurt to rehearse with a
friend, or in front of a mirror, or even with a video camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to know if your body language is betraying any
negativity,'' Mandel said. ``A job interview is not the place to
unload about how badly you were treated. You can do that with your
friends and relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer Job
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'd like my 13-year-old son to get a job this summer. Does he
need a work permit? What are the laws that govern teenage
employment?
</P>
<P>
   A: Federal law says that most kids can't be officially employed
until they're 14 years old. So your son is still limited to
informal work like lawn mowing or _ in this high-tech era _
designing Web pages for friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only things I know of for 13-year-olds are jobs helping
their neighbors, like baby-sitting or weeding gardens,'' said Susan
Hoganson, executive director of Enterprise for High School
Students, a San Francisco nonprofit that helps teens get jobs.
</P>
<P>
   You're probably not the only parent thinking about summer jobs
for their kids at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   So here's what federal law says about summer work for teens,
according to Hoganson:
</P>
<P>
   _Kids younger than 18 need a work permit to hold a job. These
can usually be obtained from your local school district.
</P>
<P>
   _Kids ages 14 through 17 can work up to eight hours a day or 40
hours a week during the summer. Their shifts must fall between 7
a.m. and 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _Kids ages 14 and 15 are prohibited from working in some
hazardous fields like manufacturing and construction. Kids ages 16
and 17 have more leeway but still aren't allowed to drive motor
vehicles on the job or use certain tools such as power saws and
meat slicers.
</P>
<P>
   More questions about summer jobs for teens? Talk to the
vocational counselor at your child's school. Or in San Francisco,
contact Jobs for Youth at (415) 861-5627 or Enterprise for High
School Students at (415) 896-0909.
</P>
<P>
   `Weird' Rules
</P>
<P>
   Q: My company recently designated all its employees as nonexempt
and adopted a policy that discourages overtime or comp time. Here's
the problem: We don't have time cards, and there seems to be a
double standard. Some employees are given comp time
surreptitiously, while the rest of us are told it's not available.
This all seems weird and illegal to me. What can we do about it?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: ``Weird'' is right: It's highly unusual for a firm to
suddenly reclassify all its employees as nonexempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cases we hear about usually go the other way _ where a
company tries to classify everyone as exempt, to avoid paying
overtime,'' said Conley Baker, a human resources consultant with
the Employers Group in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Your situation sounds potentially illegal, too, for a couple of
reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _Employers are required to keep daily time records for their
nonexempt employees. Without time cards or a time clock, it's hard
to see how your firm would be in compliance with the law.
</P>
<P>
   _California and federal laws severely limit the use of comp time
for nonexempt employees, except in workplaces governed by union
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Companies can provide time off within a 40-hour week _ giving
someone two hours off on Tuesday, for instance, to make up for a
10-hour day on Monday. But companies generally can't use comp time
as a substitute for overtime pay when nonexempt workers put in more
than 40 hours.
</P>
<P>
   I'd suggest pointing out these potential legal land mines to
your firm's personnel manager. The company should hire an
employment lawyer to draft better policies _ or at least seek
advice from an association like the Employers Group at (415)
495-2527 or the California Chamber of Commerce at (916) 444-6670.
</P>
<P>
   What if the company refuses to shape up? You can file a
complaint with the California Labor Commissioner at (415) 557-7878.
Or contact the Employment Law Center in San Francisco, which offers
free legal advice to low-income workers at (415) 864-8208.

 Business the Feng Shui Way
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Several hundred fashion designers, accountants and seamstresses
gathered in the entryway of Esprit de Corp.'s headquarters as a
black-clad Tibetan Buddhist teacher reached up his hands and
scattered bright red-dyed rice into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray that Esprit Corp.'s business will be more and more
prosperous and more and more successful,'' said Grand Master Thomas
Lin Yun.
</P>
<P>
   Lin Yun was visiting the San Francisco clothing company this
week to bless and celebrate its use of feng shui, the ancient
Chinese art that claims to foster well-being and prosperity through
the systematic arrangement of furniture and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Developed 3,000 years ago in rural China, feng shui (pronounced
``fung shway'') is said to promote well-being by fostering a good
flow of ch'i or life-energy through buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of American businesses today are openly
bringing feng shui into their workplaces to boost their bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   Some are doing it to attract Asian customers _ many of whom
wouldn't dream of staying in a hotel or leasing an office without
the seal of approval of a feng shui master.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is a place where the East meets the West,'' said
Frank Williams, architect of a new luxury apartment building on
Second Street that is being constructed with advice from feng shui
experts. ``This was to make sure that someone with a strong belief
in feng shui would be able to choose to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   But other U.S. firms, including Esprit, are incorporating feng
shui for internal reasons that have nothing to do with &LR;   &LR; marketing
to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   They are hoping that feng shui will foster a more harmonious
working environment, which in turn will boost productivity and
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying that we love our building, we love the people in
our building, and we want to create an environment that everyone
feels comfortable in,'' said Esprit CEO Jay Margolis.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say companies are throwing their money away when they
fork over fees of up to $300 an hour to feng shui consultants.
</P>
<P>
   There's no organization that licenses or issues credentials to
feng shui practitioners, who range from scholars who have spent
years studying Eastern philosophy to dabblers who skim a book or
two and then dub themselves feng shui ``experts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a party game, it's not bad. But I don't think it has any
place in modern business,'' said Barry Beyerstein, a biopsychology
professor at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver who is on the
executive council of the Committee for Scientific Investigation of
Claims of the Paranormal. ``If I worked at a place that was doing
this, I'd start looking for a new job. I'd be wondering, `If
management is this desperate, what else is going wrong?'''
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui had its roots in the rigors of ancient agricultural
life in China. For instance, early feng shui teachers told people
to build their homes facing south, which would have helped farmers
create a sunny and warm living space.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all feng shui adherents today share certain basic
practices. They all, for example, use an octagonal chart called a
ba-gua at a site to see which portions of a building match up best
with such desirable qualities as wealth, fame and flourishing
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also very different schools of thought within feng
shui about how to use the ba-gua _ so that two different
practitioners might easily give conflicting advice about where to
place pieces of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   And none of the different feng shui approaches has ever been
scientifically tested or proven.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you measure something that claims to promote good
luck?'' scoffed Dr. Wallace Sampson, a Los Altos oncologist who is
editor of the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feng shui is potentially testable, but the claims are so vague
it would be like nailing a custard pie to the wall,'' Beyerstein
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners who have used feng shui say they don't need a
scientific study: Their own subjective experience has convinced
them it works.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Takayama, president of the small Fremont biotech firm Lab
Vision Corp., hired San Francisco feng shui consultant Deborah Gee
to analyze his office last year. Gee suggested changes such as
moving the reception desk, moving some plants, painting a few walls
red, and hanging wooden flutes in Takayama's private office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm more productive now,'' Takayama said. ``And
everyone comments on the changes to our lobby. They say it's a good
feeling to be there and walk through there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Berkeley restaurant owner Christophe Kubiak credits
feng shui with boosting business at his new eatery, Voulez-Vous on
College Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too much into energy and all that, and I don't want to
have a Buddha sitting by every door, but after feng shui, we saw an
80 percent increase in our business,'' Kubiak said.
</P>
<P>
   At Esprit, the person who introduced the idea of feng shui is
none other than Alison May, the chief financial officer. On her
bookshelf, a copy of ``The I Ching Workbook'' is sandwiched between
binders labeled ``Financial Review Package 1998'' and minutes from
corporate board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Esprit embarked on its feng shui makeover in late 1998. Among
the changes it made: painting many of the doors bright colors based
on the ba-gua, adding a small bamboo fountain to the front
reception desk, relocating or partitioning some offices, hanging
bright-colored banners over certain areas, adding mirrors and
Esprit promotional artwork throughout the building and hanging
wooden flutes in the bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked really hard last year, but we've had much better
results in 1999 (after doing feng shui) than we did in 1998,'' said
May. ``Is feng shui the determining cause? I don't know. But I do
know our financial performance so far is twice as good as last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  There are no hard data on how many American businesses are
turning to feng shui or on the amount of corporate money going to
feng shui consultants.
</P>
<P>
   But interest is clearly growing. Villard Press, a division of
Random House, published a book last year called ``Feng Shui at
Work.'' Its author, Kirsten Lagatree, was just hired to write a
bimonthly feng shui column in the real estate section of the Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of feng shui practitioners and thousands of
American businesses that have received feng shui advice at all
levels of expertise,'' estimated Steven Post, a San Francisco feng
shui practitioner who studied under Lin Yun, who is based at a
Berkeley temple.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the spread of feng shui in the workplace is due
in part to American businesspeople's increased contact with Asian
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first exposure was when I helped set up a manufacturing
plant in Singapore several years ago, and they hired a feng shui
expert,'' said Takayama, the biotech executive. ``Everything felt
right. It seemed magical.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say it just shows how unnerved people are by today's
fast-changing, competitive economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstitions show up where there isn't any tried-and-true way
of succeeding,'' said Beyerstein. ``People are looking for a hedge,
a way to get a leg up in this dog-eat-dog world. It doesn't matter
how outrageous it is: If you tell them something will improve their
bottom line, they have an odd ability to believe it without
checking it out.''

 FCC Opens Up Telephone Services
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
California consumers may soon have more choice for local phone
service and high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators ruled yesterday that regional Bell companies,
such as Pacific Bell, must make it easier for competing local phone
companies to set up their own equipment within the Bells' central
switching offices.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling eases restrictions on where competitors can place
their gear and prevents Baby Bells from limiting the type of
equipment that's allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC order is a win for companies such as Santa Clara's Covad
Communications and San Francisco's Northpoint Communications, which
are trying to construct nationwide local phone networks to offer
high-speed Internet access. Both companies say their plans have
been delayed by the Baby Bell phone companies, which have made it
difficult for them to locate equipment _ such as routers and
switches _ which are necessary for providing high-speed Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's order will make it cheaper and easier for companies to
roll out services such as digital subscriber lines, which access
the Internet up to 50 times faster than traditional modems. The
ruling should help consumers by giving them more choices for
Internet service in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings competition a whole lot faster,'' said Dhruv
Khanna, executive vice president of Covad. ``If I can get into a
central office in one month rather than six months, it helps the
consumer. And if my costs are considerably reduced, I can go into
central offices that I wouldn't necessarily go into and offer
service in more places.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came after Covad and others complained about being
denied access to competitors central offices. The 1996
Telecommunications Act, which lifted regulations on the phone
industry, mandates that competitors be allowed access to the
regional Bell companies' offices.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't been happening, Khanna said. He said Covad has
often waited six months before gaining access to a site and has
been charged up to $400,000 for locating its equipment in 10-foot
by 10-foot cages.
</P>
<P>
   Once allowed into the office, Khanna said, the companies were
not given access to the entire central office and were told where
they could place their equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the incumbents have insisted on a separate entrance
for us, a separate walled-off area and separate cage for our
equipment,'' Khanna said.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC said yesterday that the incumbents cannot discriminate
against competitors and must give them equal access. The ruling
allows competing companies to inspect a central office to verify
space constraints, install a wider range of equipment and rent a
small area, rather than a huge, expensive cage.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell officials said they need more time to review the
decision, but said they believe the company is already doing much
of what the FCC requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-two competitors operate from our offices, they have
installed 1,264 cages and they are locating in 102 of our central
offices,'' said Bill Mashek, a spokesman for Pac Bell. ``We have
more co-location space and cages than any other company in any
other state.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashek said the company might challenge portions of the FCC's
decision if it gives competitors unfettered access to the entire
central office, rather than a specific, walled-off area.
</P>
<P>
   Mashek said that could pose security risks.

 Big Money For Thieves In Hardware
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jamie Beckett &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
High-technology companies are losing about $250 million a year to
hardware thieves, who can make more money stealing a suitcase of
microprocessors than a suitcase of cocaine, according to a study
released yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Those thefts represent about 0.1 percent of industry revenues,
according to the report prepared by Rand, a Santa Monica nonprofit
organization, for the American Electronics Association and the
International Electronics Security Group.
</P>
<P>
   Indirect costs _ such as lost business and added security and
insurance needs _ raised the total cost to more than $1 billion
annually, the study said. It estimated that thieves steal another
$4 billion in equipment from business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, especially laptops, are the most popular item among
thieves, accounting for 44 percent of stolen goods, the study said.
Other popular items: disk drives (33 percent), semiconductors (11
percent) and cellular phones and pagers (4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The study did not include theft of software, or theft from
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, most of the thefts weren't large heists _ only 3
percent resulted in losses of $100,000 or more, while 80 percent
were for items worth less than $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers surveyed 95 high-technology manufacturers that
collectively account for 40 percent of the sales volume in the
computer, semiconductor, hard-disk drive and cellular phone
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the study was released, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, U.S. Customs Service and the San Jose Police
arrested eight people in San Jose who they said were involved in a
series of chip thefts.

Column: Why This Columnist Finds Boring the Obsession With Dow
10,000
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By Mark Veverka &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Two-and-a-half lousy points.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but this obsession with the industrials
closing above 10K is about as exciting as watching grass grow. That
is to say, it's slightly more scintillating than watching the
Senate put the president on trial when everybody knew the upper
house would never toss the Defendant in Chief out on his keister.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Dow, however, at least there's a snowball's
chance in Hades that history will repeat itself. Just as it took
more than six years for the Dow to close above 1,000 after first
hitting the mark, it might take another six years before the
storied stock market index reaches the latest but arbitrary
milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, probably not.
</P>
<P>
   There's a better chance that the industrials will close above
10,000 before the weekend starts. But don't expect me to be glued
to CNBC, I'll be outside cutting my lawn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KICKING IN: &LR;  San Francisco Soccer Development Corp., the
company that owns the San Francisco Bay Seals, has scored an
institutional shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Peacock Financial, a publicly held holding company that is
traded over the counter, has taken a 5 percent stake in the minor
league pro soccer team. What's more, Peacock has secured an option
to buy an additional 5 percent on top of that over the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for Peacock Financial of San Jacinto (Riverside
County) to swap $100,000 worth of its shares for 200,000 shares of
Seals stock. Of course, a hundred-thousand bucks wouldn't even
cover the minimum annual salary of an NBA bench warmer, but it's a
start.
</P>
<P>
   Another disconcerting thing is that Peacock isn't exactly GE
Financial. Still, it is an institutional shareholder nonetheless,
and that should help raise the profile of minor league soccer team
within the financial community, says Yan Skwara, director of
corporate finance for the Seals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being that Peacock is publicly traded, it continues to expose
the offering to Wall Street,'' Skwara says.
</P>
<P>
   Peacock, whose stock is trading at 15 cents a share on the OTC
Bulletin Board, is trying to rebound from a rocky real estate
development past, Skwara says.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: Investing in minor league soccer is mostly about
helping the world's most popular sport maintain its footing on
American turf. If you want to quadruple your money, may I suggest
you invest in an Internet stock with fat annual loss projections.
</P>
<P>
   As regular readers of Street Smarts may recall, this column
reported that the Seals minor league soccer club hopes to raise $1
million through a private placement. So far, a handful of
individuals have invested in the Seals, but Peacock is the first
investor to buy a block, Skwara says.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to note that Skwara is also the chief executive
of the San Diego Flash, which competes with the Seals in the same
league. Their teams are rivals in the top rung of the United Soccer
League, which is comparable to baseball's Triple A level. In a
spirit of cooperation that you aren't likely to find between, say,
the Raiders' Al Davis and the 49ers' Bill Walsh, Skwara has the
unusual role of also overseeing the Seals' corporate finance
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Why help a competitor raise money?
</P>
<P>
   Because professional soccer in the United States needs all the
financial help it can get, says Skwara, an investment banker and a
former stock broker.
</P>
<P>
   In short, raising the economic values of other teams should pump
up the price of his San Diego franchise, he says. He believes that
minor league soccer franchises could see their values increase
because the number of teams to be allowed in the United Soccer
League's top division is being capped at 32.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, thinking longer term, Skwara contends that San
Diego and the northern Bay Area deserve to have big-league soccer
and that both the Flash and Seals could possibly join Major League
Soccer some day. (The Bay Area's lone major league franchise is the
San Jose Clash.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our business plan for both the Flash and Seals to
become Major League Soccer franchises,'' Skwara muses.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Major League Soccer would have to drastically revamp
its policies and financial structure for its franchises to see
significant leaps in value. But Skwara is betting that the sport's
top professional league is moving in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Skwara plans to implement an alternative exit
strategy for investors. The Flash's CEO plans to take his soccer
franchise public in June.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego club is wrapping up a $1 million private placement
similar to the one now in progress for the Seals. Once that is
done, the Flash is expected to offer stock to the public for about
$5 a share in June.
</P>
<P>
   The offering is expected to be managed by Lloyd Wade Securities
of Dallas, which currently owns about 2,000 shares of the Flash,
and First Midwest Securities of Milwaukee, which was the lead
manager of a 1997 IPO for the Orlando Predators of the Arena
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that we can execute this offering effectively,''
Skwara predicts.
</P>
<P>
   He has reasons to be optimistic. The Flash expects to grow
merchandising revenues, is talking to San Diego officials about a
possible new stadium and has had a corporate sponsor for more than
a year. Delta Air Lines provides free airline tickets to the team
worth upwards of $50,000 in exchange for marketing rights. (A
similar deal between the Seals and Delta was just cut this week.)
</P>
<P>
   And if the Flash's IPO is successful, don't be surprised if
Skwara plans a similar offering for the Seals. That, of course,
assumes that the San Francisco team sells out its private placement
first.

PATRIOTS STAGE-DIVING CASE SETTLEMENT NEAR, CLUB OWNER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER AND STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a move which could bring an end to an embarrassing
chapter in Boston sports history, a woman who was injured when two
New England Patriots players dived off the stage of the Paradise
nightclub in Boston has been offered a a $1.2 million settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed settlement has not yet been formally signed, but
all the parties involved in the incident have agreed to its terms
in principle according Paradise owner Seth Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on the table now, and it's just a matter of dotting the
Is and crossing the Ts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If signed, the settlement would end the lawsuit and resulting
negative publicity for the football team and the nightclub, whose
liquor license was suspended for five days because of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing has been a nightmare for everybody,'' said
Greenberg, who confirmed that a settlement has been negotiated.
``It was bad for the players, bad for the girl, and terrible for
the club. But hey, it happened, we settled, and people move on.''
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, insurance companies for the Paradise and
Everclear, the band playing at the club the night of the incident,
will each contribute $100,000 to the settlement. The remaining $1
million will be paid by the two Patriots players, quarterback Drew
Bledsoe and lineman Max Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, who reportedly does not have liability insurance, will
personally pay $600,000, sources said. Bledsoe will reportedly pay
$400,000, half from an insurance policy and half from personal
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe earns $42 million over seven years and Lane $11 million
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Tameekea Messier, the woman injured in the
stage-diving incident, had been seeking $3 million, sources said.
Messier reportedly incurred medical bills of roughly $35,000 as a
result of her injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most lawyers said this case would settle for $200,000,'' said
Greenberg, ``but because of the publicity surrounding it and the
players involved, the case was able to get much more.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred Nov. 11, 1997, when the 305-pound Lane and
235-pound Bledsoe leaped off the stage into a ``mosh pit'' of fans.
Lane allegedly landed on Messier's forehead, while Bledsoe
allegedly struck her head and neck.
</P>
<P>
   After the stage-diving accident, Messier underwent neck surgery
at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center to have two spinal discs removed
and three vertebrae fused. According to her lawyer, she is able to
work and is doing well, but still has pain in her upper back and
neck.
</P>
<P>
   Messier later sued the two players, alleging that they were
negligent or reckless, as well as the band and the club, claiming
that they also were negligent.
</P>
<P>
   The players have admitted to diving off the stage, but deny that
they caused Messier's injuries. A lawyer for the nightclub
contended that Messier may have had a medical condition that
contributed to her injuries.
</P>
<P>
   With the Paradise facing mounting legal bills, the club agreed
to settle, Greenberg said. He said the nightclub's legal fees have
already reached $200,000 as a result of the case. The cost of
insuring the club will more than double as a result of the
settlement, from $75,000 a year to $160,000 a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Messier, Bledsoe or their lawyers were
unsuccessful Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at their homes, Messier's mother and brother said they
were unaware of any settlement.

IN PONDERING A SENATE RACE, MRS. CLINTON STUDIES NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS.: Subs to correct figure in lede, and adds phrase for
clarity) 
(wg) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the month since announcing her interest in a U.S.
Senate seat from New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton has discussed her
potential candidacy with more than 50 influential Democrats in the
state, including the major party chairmen from the suburban and
upstate counties crucial to winning a race.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials say Mrs. Clinton did not hint at her ultimate
decision, but she is systematically studying the politics and
issues of a state where she has never even lived. And a number of
Democrats said Mrs. Clinton has told them she plans to do polling
and that she is looking for ways to raise money even before she
makes a decision on the race. Many officials describe their
conversations with the first lady as lengthy and very detailed
about local issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's obviously been doing her homework,'' said Steve Pigeon,
the Democratic chairman of Erie County, the state's largest
Democratic stronghold outside of New York City. Pigeon said he
spoke by phone to Mrs. Clinton for an hour on Monday night. ``I
have to explain to a lot of candidates who come to me that you
can't view upstate monolithically,'' he said. ``She already knew
the vast differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Pigeon said that Mrs. Clinton told him that she does not want
her delay in making a decision to undercut the ability of other
potential Democratic candidates _ like Rep. Nita Lowey of
Westchester County _ to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the possible impact on other likely
candidates and their ability to raise money if Mrs. Clinton does
not run, many Democrats have been irked by her announcement that
she will not make a decision until ``later this year,'' perhaps as
late as this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In apparent response to that concern, the first lady and her
advisers are exploring fund-raising options: ``She said they're
looking for vehicles to raise money to be used for whoever the
candidate is,'' Pigeon said. ``I think as long as she's raising
money that can be used no matter who runs, whether it's her or
Nita, that can buy some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Election law lawyers said Thursday that such a vehicle might
involve a committee, allowed under federal election law, that would
raise money for an unspecified Senate candidate in donations of up
to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In making her calls, Mrs. Clinton works from a list of 200 names
provided by Harold Ickes, a former White House official and a
veteran of New York politics. Mrs. Clinton's advisers say she has
methodically made her way through the Democratic power structure in
New York state: labor leaders, major county leaders and county
executives, fund-raisers, members of the New York congressional
delegation and leaders of black, Jewish, Hispanic and women's
groups.
</P>
<P>
   She has also had meetings at the White House with a number of
New York officials _ on Thursday with New York City Comptroller
Alan Hevesi and last Friday with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi said that he and the first lady spoke for more than an
hour, half of which he said was spent on Amadou Diallo, the unarmed
African immigrant whose shooting death by the New York City police
has led to protests against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a potential
opponent of Mrs. Clinton. Hevesi said Mrs. Clinton brought up the
case herself but made no comment on Giuliani's handling of it.
</P>
<P>
   Silver met for an hour and 45 minutes with the first lady. In
another indication that Mrs. Clinton may be positioning herself as
a candidate, Silver said that she elaborated on her remarks last
year that a Palestinian state was ``very important'' to Middle East
peace. Giuliani has said her comments were ``a very big mistake,''
while political analysts have said her remarks could give the mayor
a chance to cut into any support she has among Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said Mrs. Clinton told him that her remarks were a
``reflection of her discussions'' with Yitzhak Rabin, the late
Israeli prime minister, ``and that Rabin had told her that ``it was
very difficult to negotiate with a nonentity.'' Silver added that
Mrs. Clinton said her remarks ``are not inconsistent with American
policy.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Upstate and suburban Democratic party officials, who seem
stunned by the first lady's attention, say Mrs. Clinton hasn't told
them whether she plans to run. But most have come away from
conversations with Mrs. Clinton believing that she will be a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was talking to a political pro,'' said Steve
Paquette, the Onondaga County Democratic chairman, who spoke to
Mrs. Clinton for a half-hour last Thursday. ``I honestly think for
her to be taking the next broad step of calling folks like me,
that's more than sticking your toe in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton makes her calls from the family quarters of the
White House, often at the end of the working day, and sometimes
after a call first from Ickes _ who now has his own Washington
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockland County Democratic chairman, Paul Adler, said last
week that Ickes called and asked him about local issues, and that
Mrs. Clinton then called to talk about property taxes, suburban
development, the regional economy and transportation into New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key here is that they're listening,'' Adler said.
``They're not coming in here and saying, `We ran two races
exceedingly well, shut up, sit back and enjoy the ride.' They're
saying, `How do you think we should do it, what makes your county
tick?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ickes said that Mrs. Clinton is educating herself about New York
through her phone calls, which she makes alone. ``She's finding out
the lay of the political landscape, the lay of the issue
landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most Democratic Party activists are clamoring for Mrs.
Clinton to run, many have also told her the race will be very close
and that she should expect personal attacks for her role in the
Whitewater scandal and her spectacularly profitable trades in the
commodities markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly indicated that it would be a tough race,'' said
Dominic Baranello, the Democratic chairman of the heavily
Republican Suffolk County. Baranello said he told Mrs. Clinton last
week that the Republicans ``would revive many of the issues we've
been hearing about ad nauseum'' and that ``she has to be prepared
to handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local Democratic leaders say they have been taken aback by
the intricacy of Mrs. Clinton's questions. ``She was curious about
why there was a large Jordanian population in Yonkers,'' said
Alpert, the Westchester Democrat, who spoke to Mrs. Clinton for
nearly an hour. ``I did not know the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Alpert also said that he and Mrs. Clinton talked about friends
and colleagues they had in common in Westchester _ Ron Brown, the
late secretary of commerce who was a Democratic district leader in
Mount Vernon in the 1970s; and Toby Nussbaum, a former county
Democratic finance chairman who is married to Bernard Nussbaum, a
friend of Mrs. Clinton's and a former White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Alpert said Mrs. Clinton told him that they are ``relatives''
because of their mutual friends.
</P>
<P>
   On March 5, the president and Mrs. Clinton had a small dinner in
the family quarters of the White House for important New Yorkers.
The guests included Carl McCall, the state comptroller; Randi
Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers;
Dennis Rivera, the president of Local 1199, of the National Health
and Human Service Employees Union; Bill Lynch, longtime adviser to
former Mayor David Dinkins; Victor Kovner, a First Amendment lawyer
and a corporation counsel in the Dinkins administration; and Sarah
Kovner, who is a special assistant to the secretary of health and
human services and Kovner's wife.
</P>
<P>
   The guests were up until 1:30 a.m. having dinner and watching a
movie. Afterward, the New Yorkers slept over at the White House.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Financially reeling from deep cuts in Medicare
reimbursement, Massachusetts teaching hospitals are showing
substantial losses in the first three months of fiscal 1999, with
one facility hemorrhaging more than $1 million a week.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed at the amount of red ink, hospitals are frantically
lobbying Congress for relief. The effort comes at a crucial time
for hospitals as Washington lawmakers contemplate further
reductions as part of next year's Medicare budget.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare is the biggest single source of revenue for hospitals
around the country, pumping $108 billion a year into the industry.
In Massachusetts, hospitals rely on Medicare for $3 billion a year,
or about 30 percent of their revenue.
</P>
<P>
   That stream of money has become critical to academic teaching
hospitals coping with the high price of staying on the cutting edge
of medicine and the increasingly tight payments from managed-care
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   But as Washington ratchets down the Medicare budget, academic
medical centers nationwide are plunging into the red. The effects
are particularly acute in Massachusetts, home to one of the highest
concentrations of teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely remarkable to me,'' said Jeffrey Otten,
president of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. ``Our
operating rooms are filled. We're reopening beds that we've closed.
Our emergency visits are up 17 percent this year. The demand for
our services is greater than they've ever been. We're full, and yet
we're losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first fiscal quarter of 1999, which ended Dec. 31,
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston lost nearly $5 million,
after making close to $10 million in the first quarter last year.
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston lost $16.7 million,
compared to a $1.2 million gain last year. Brigham and Women's
posted a loss of $3.5 million, compared to a loss of $800,000 in
the same period last year. And UMass Memorial Health Care in
Worcester saw a $6.6 million loss, more than quadruple its loss in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you look, hospitals are losing money,'' said Dr.
James Reinertsen, chief executive of CareGroup Inc., which owns
Beth Israel Deaconess. ``This is unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   While the figures do not reflect an entire year's performance,
the first quarter is often the most telling period for hospitals,
according to Gregg Bennett, chief executive of HBS International, a
health care data consulting firm in Belleview, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, cuts in Medicare aren't entirely responsible for the
red ink. Hospitals in the state this year are having to spend tens
of millions of dollars to fix the computer problem popularly known
as the Y2K bug. In addition, the cost of medication is
skyrocketing, even as managed-care insurers continue to squeeze the
rate they pay to hospitals, said Dr. Michael Collins, chief
executive of Caritas Christi, a Catholic hospital system that owns
St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Medicare was considered a generous payer, and
academic hospitals relied on the money as a cushion to fund
teaching and research programs as well as to make up for losses
from their other operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the cushion is rapidly disappearing. In 1997, Congress
passed the Balanced Budget Act, which sought to slice $112 billion
in Medicare spending over five years. In Massachusetts, that
translates to a $1.5 billion cut from what hospitals would have
received without the Balanced Budget Act. In 1997, only one in 10
hospitals lost money on their Medicare patients, according to the
Massachusetts Hospital Association. Today, three out of 10
hospitals do not make money from Medicare. And in 2001, projections
show that half of the state's hospitals will lose money from
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare was the safety valve,'' said Ronald Hollander,
president of the hospital association. ``But the Balanced Budget
Act changed everything . . .. It's my conclusion that we're on an
unsustainable collision course.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture is expected to get worse. Hospitals currently are in
the second year of a five-year cycle set up by the Balanced Budget
Act, and the bulk of the reductions are scheduled to take place in
the final three years.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals, which employ one out of five workers in
Boston, are coping in various ways. St. Elizabeth's has a hiring
freeze on all positions not involving direct patient care. UMass
Memorial has laid off one-third of its senior management team and
12 percent of its middle management team. Construction for a new
ambulatory care center at Mass. General has been delayed for
several months.
</P>
<P>
   Community hospitals also have been hit hard. Boston Regional
Medical Center recently closed its doors after serving Stoneham
residents for more than 100 years. Malden Hospital has decided to
fold its inpatient beds. And East Boston Neighborhood Health Center
filed for bankruptcy court protection.
</P>
<P>
   The changes by themselves may not be dramatic, but hospital
officials insist they amount to an erosion in the foundation of an
industry that has given Massachusetts its reputation as the
nation's ``medical mecca.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These places tend to bend rather than break,'' said Dr. James
Mongan, president of Mass. General. ``They slowly deteriorate over
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University officials were worried enough about the
financial conditions of its major affiliated teaching hospitals to
call a meeting in February to discuss the financial losses.
Attending the meeting was Harvard University President Neil L.
Rudenstine, Harvard Medical School Dean Joseph Martin, and the
chief executives and board chairmen of the Brigham, Beth Israel,
Mass. General, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Children's
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting resulted in an agreement among all the Harvard
hospitals to collaboratively find ways to cut costs. It was unusual
in that it called upon two rival Harvard hospital systems _
Partners HealthCare System Inc., which owns Mass. General and the
Brigham, and CareGroup Inc., which owns Beth Israel Deaconess _ to
work together in teaching and research efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming more efficient is one way to cope, but at some point,
the cuts will slice into bone, said Dr. Peter Levine, chief
executive of UMass Memorial, which has cut $22 million from its
hospital budget in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Levine points to Assabet Valley Home Health Association in
Marlborough, which shut down last year because of financial
distress caused by Medicare cuts. While UMass had no business ties
with the Marlborough agency, they often cared for the same
patients. ``We were asked to step in and take it over,'' Levine
said. ``But we were in a very large deficit position, and we were
not able to do that. So the agency just disappeared, and a large
number of patients were cast adrift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't low-level whining on the part of hospitals,''
Levine says. ``This has gotten to the point where there are things
you know you should be doing that you cannot do.''

PATRIOTS STAGE-DIVING CASE SETTLEMENT NEAR, CLUB OWNER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER AND STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON -- In a move which could bring an end to an embarrassing
chapter in Boston sports history, a woman who was injured when two
New England Patriots players dived off the stage of the Paradise
nightclub in Boston has been offered a a $1.2 million settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed settlement has not yet been formally signed, but
all the parties involved in the incident have agreed to its terms
in principle according Paradise owner Seth Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on the table now, and it's just a matter of dotting the
Is and crossing the Ts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If signed, the settlement would end the lawsuit and resulting
negative publicity for the football team and the nightclub, whose
liquor license was suspended for five days because of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing has been a nightmare for everybody,'' said
Greenberg, who confirmed that a settlement has been negotiated.
``It was bad for the players, bad for the girl, and terrible for
the club. But hey, it happened, we settled, and people move on.''
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, insurance companies for the Paradise and
Everclear, the band playing at the club the night of the incident,
will each contribute $100,000 to the settlement. The remaining $1
million will be paid by the two Patriots players, quarterback Drew
Bledsoe and lineman Max Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, who reportedly does not have liability insurance, will
personally pay $600,000, sources said. Bledsoe will reportedly pay
$400,000, half from an insurance policy and half from personal
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe earns $42 million over seven years and Lane $11 million
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Tameekea Messier, the woman injured in the
stage-diving incident, had been seeking $3 million, sources said.
Messier reportedly incurred medical bills of roughly $35,000 as a
result of her injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most lawyers said this case would settle for $200,000,'' said
Greenberg, ``but because of the publicity surrounding it and the
players involved, the case was able to get much more.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred Nov. 11, 1997, when the 305-pound Lane and
235-pound Bledsoe leaped off the stage into a ``mosh pit'' of fans.
Lane allegedly landed on Messier's forehead, while Bledsoe
allegedly struck her head and neck.
</P>
<P>
   After the stage-diving accident, Messier underwent neck surgery
at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center to have two spinal discs removed
and three vertebrae fused. According to her lawyer, she is able to
work and is doing well, but still has pain in her upper back and
neck.
</P>
<P>
   Messier later sued the two players, alleging that they were
negligent or reckless, as well as the band and the club, claiming
that they also were negligent.
</P>
<P>
   The players have admitted to diving off the stage, but deny that
they caused Messier's injuries. A lawyer for the nightclub
contended that Messier may have had a medical condition that
contributed to her injuries.
</P>
<P>
   With the Paradise facing mounting legal bills, the club agreed
to settle, Greenberg said. He said the nightclub's legal fees have
already reached $200,000 as a result of the case. The cost of
insuring the club will more than double as a result of the
settlement, from $75,000 a year to $160,000 a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Messier, Bledsoe or their lawyers were
unsuccessful Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at their homes, Messier's mother and brother said they
were unaware of any settlement.

YUGOSLAV JOURNALISTS WARN OF NATO STRIKE CONSEQUENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As their homeland edges toward all-out war, two visiting
Yugoslav journalists warned Thursday that Kosovo's Albanians will
suffer the consequences of any NATO military strike against Serbian
targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think NATO should seriously consider the results of its
actions,'' said Dorijan Nuaj, editor in chief of Radio Contact, an
independent radio station in the Kosovo capital of Pristina. ``I'd
like to ask those NATO generals just what they think the
consequences will be for the Albanians, because they are the ones
who are going to suffer the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 16,000 and 21,000 well-equipped Yugoslav army troops are
now on the perimeter of Kosovo, and another 14,000 to 18,000 are
deployed in the province. Military analysts say the Serbs are
capable of inflicting heavy casualties throughout Kosovo in
retaliation for any NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his blunt warning, Nuaj is no Serb nationalist, nor is
he a supporter of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old editor is half Albanian and half Montenegrin,
placing him in a very precarious position in today's strife-torn
Balkans, where one's name and ethnicity can mean life or death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks about leaving, but there is really no place
for me to go,'' said Nuaj, who fears hostilities will ``probably''
erupt by the time he returns home on March 27. ``So I have a very
personal interest in seeing some kind of peace in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuaj is also caught in the middle of a difficult and sometimes
dangerous battle to liberalize the media in Yugoslavia. Milosevic's
Ministry of Telecommunications banned Radio Contact last year after
the station had been on the air for only 10 days. The government
didn't like the station's independent programming, which included
both Serbians and Albanians _ some of whom were openly critical of
Milosevic's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shut us down because we broadcast in the Serb language
and they won't tolerate an independent Serb-language radio station
in Kosovo,'' said Nuaj, who was in Seattle, Wash., as part of a
six-member group of young journalists from Serbia and Montenegro on
a weeklong U.S. tour sponsored by the U.S. Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government wants to control what the Serb people hear.
They don't care that much about Albanians because they can't
control them anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   After it was banned by the government, Radio Contact was given a
satellite frequency by the British Broadcasting Corp. and now beams
a daily 15-minute Serb-language report that can be heard all over
Europe _ including in Kosovo. The station has also received
assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development and
the Open Society Institute of financier George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people have been killed in a year of fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant of two remaining
republics comprising Yugoslavia. Montenegro is the other.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2.2 million people are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence.
</P>
<P>
   But Nuaj and a colleague, Bojan Cvetkovic, say Milosevic and
most Serbs will never allow that. Nor will they agree to a NATO
military presence in Kosovo, as called for in the peace agreement
signed in Paris Thursday by the Albanian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Milosevic allows NATO into Kosovo, he will be dead
politically,'' said Cvetkovic, a 28-year-old Serb radio and
newspaper reporter in the town of Smederevska Palanka, 40 miles
south of Belgrade. ``There will be riots in Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Cvetkovic said ``all sides are bluffing'' as the situation in
Kosovo grows increasingly serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever he has faced economic troubles like he does right
now, Milosevic made some kind of conflict so people would rally
around and forget their problems,'' Cvetkovic said. ``And I think
NATO is really afraid to send troops in on the ground. The
Americans are trying to push the Europeans into doing it. There are
so many competing interests just among the Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic puts on such a good poker party.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuaj said this potentially deadly game of bluff has now become
so serious that Milosevic himself ``probably doesn't know what he
is going to do in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a question of airplanes and air strikes,'' he
said. ``We are looking at a humanitarian disaster.''

COURT TOLD OF DRAFT INDICTMENT THAT INCLUDED HILLARY CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEVE BARNES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton was named in an
indictment drafted by a top aide to Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, but the document was never presented to a grand jury, and
no charges were brought against the first lady, the aide testified
in U.S. District Court here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure came from the deputy independent counsel, W.
Hickman Ewing, who was subpoenaed as the first witness for the
defense in the contempt-of-court trial of Susan McDougal, a former
business partner of the Clintons'.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was not asked what charges he had specified in the draft
indictment he drew up against Mrs. Clinton, but he suggested that
he considered her responses to questions put to her under oath as
less than forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, who is in charge of the Arkansas phase of the Whitewater
inquiry headed by Starr, testified that he wrote the indictment in
late 1996 after becoming convinced that Mrs. Clinton had not been
truthful in discussions with Starr's staff. The independent counsel
has been investigating the Clintons' involvement in a complex
series of loans and land deals that collectively have come to be
known as Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDougal and her late former husband, James McDougal, were
partners of the Clintons in the Whitewater venture. McDougal died
last year in a federal prison, and Ms. McDougal has twice refused
to answer questions from a grand jury about their financial
dealings. By calling a Starr prosecutor, she was attempting to show
that she was pressured to falsely implicate the Clintons, an
assertion the prosecutors have insisted is bogus.
</P>
<P>
   That Starr's office had drafted the indictment against Mrs.
Clinton has been known for months, but details were never
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The OIC illegally leaked this information a long time ago,''
David Kendall, the Clintons' lawyer, said in a statement Thursday
after Ewing's testimony. ``The mere fact that this prosecutor's
office drafted a frivolous indictment three years ago has no
significance whatsoever, except as a possible violation of the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in conflict with other interviews that we had already
done,'' Ewing said of Mrs. Clinton's answers to questions from
prosecutors in two meetings, including an April 1995 session at the
White House. Ewing said the conflicting information came from
interviews with some of Mrs. Clinton's former partners at the Rose
Law Firm in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing testified that based on what he knew at that point he had
questions about what Mrs. Clinton was saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had doubts?'' asked Mark Geragos, Ms. McDougal's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is correct,'' Ewing responded. ``The same was true of the
president,'' he continued, referring to an interview with the
president conducted by prosecutors the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you tell people you thought she was lying?'' Geragos
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I used the `L' word, but I certainly expressed
internally that I had some problems with some of the answers of the
president and the first lady,'' Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you have a draft indictment?'' Geragos asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say positively,'' Ewing said, but Geragos persisted
until Ewing added: ``I would say yes, but qualify that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing said it was not unusual for prosecutors to circulate
proposed indictments, whether or not a charge was ever brought.
``You're always thinking about what possible crime could it be,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had ever graded Mrs. Clinton's testimony, Ewing
recalled that he had, in a reference to one of Mrs. Clinton's
interviews with the independent counsel's staff. He said he had
given her an ``F'' because ``she had used the words `I don't
recall' about 50 times.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No charges have been brought against the Clintons in the
Whitewater investigation. Ms. McDougal is charged with blocking the
inquiry by refusing to testify to a grand jury about
Whitewater-related matters despite a judge's order to do so and a
grant of limited immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing insisted Thursday that Starr's team was interested only in
obtaining the truth, even as he acknowledged that the Clintons were
potential targets of their inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted any information (Ms. McDougal) had, including the
Clintons,'' Ewing affirmed. ``It was our duty to investigate
whether the Clintons did anything illegal.''

STRIKE WOULD BE FIRST EVER AT AMERICA WEST
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER CORBETT and MAX JARMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of bad blood and months of back-and-forth threats,
it has come down to the last minute for America West Airlines and
its 2,400 flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   By 10:01 tonight, the Tempe airline could suffer its first
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible scenarios are:
</P>
<P>
   _ A deal between the airline and the Association of Flight
Attendants.
</P>
<P>
   _ A shutdown of all operations if flight attendants strike
selected flights.
</P>
<P>
   _ An extension of talks if progress is being made.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side was hazarding a guess on what would transpire
tonight, leaving thousands of passengers up in the air about their
scheduled trips on America West during one of the busiest weekends
in the Valley's tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   As contract talks continued toward the deadline, pilots for the
Tempe carrier were being asked to support the flight attendants by
following flight operations to the letter, which could result in
flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   Even as negotiations continued, the company was taking a
get-tough stand, with Stephen Johnson, America West senior vice
president for corporate affairs, saying the carrier will fire
striking workers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zack, AFA communications director, dismissed the company
stand as a bully tactic. Firing strikers is illegal and the union
would go to court to win jobs back for the flight attendants, just
as it did in a 1993 Alaska Airlines strike, he said.
</P>
<P>
   America West lead negotiator Greg Garger said last month that
the union's CHAOS tactic _ striking selected flights _ amounts to
an illegal, intermittent strike and the company will consider
testing it in court.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA had a dry run Thursday at Sky Harbor International
Airport for CHAOS, which stands for Create Havoc Around Our System.
Flight attendants learned about the timing and where they should go
if the union decides to strike a flight they're working, Zack said.
</P>
<P>
   AFA has strike-related events planned today in Washington, D.C.;
Las Vegas; and Tempe. Flight attendants and other labor union
members are expected to gather in Washington's Franklin Park,
across from the National Mediation Board offices where the two
sides are negotiating with the help of a federal mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Another rally will be staged at Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas,
and there will be a candlelight vigil in downtown Tempe at America
West's Tempe headquarters in the hour leading up to the strike
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots became involved after an anonymous letter from a
``Concerned Captain'' was distributed to other America West pilots,
which urged them to ``do everything in our power to slow this
operation down and put pressure on this management.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter suggested a number of ``legal'' actions such as:
</P>
<P>
   Following to the letter all federal aviation regulations, flight
operations manual, aircraft manuals and flight training manual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not push back from the gate with anything but a legal
aircraft,'' the letter asserts. ``Write up every discrepancy no
matter how minor, especially at field stations.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also suggested that if a flight is targeted for CHAOS
action, the captain should take responsibility for ensuring that
any replacement flight attendants are knowledgeable in all areas of
flight safety.
</P>
<P>
   According to their union contract, the pilots can show support
for the flight attendants by walking in picket lines or attending
rallies as long as they are out of uniform. They also can support
the flight attendants through public statements.

   They cannot, however, take sympathy action that would affect the
airline's operation, according to Donald Steinman, chairman of the
Airline Pilots Association local union that represents America West
pilots. That includes any work stoppages or organization action in
support of the flight attendants' picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   The union doesn't officially sup port the letter, and Steinman
said it won't ask the pilots to do anything that would put their
jobs in jeopardy or violate their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all procedures they should be following anyway,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, representatives of the two sides resumed their
discussion, with the help of a mediator, about 9 a.m (Arizona time)
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed as a result of (Wednesday's) meeting,''
union President Bill McGlashen said be fore the second round of
talks. ``No proposals were exchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   America West's Johnson would not comment Thursday on negotia
tions and said it was inappropriate for him to speculate on whether
the two sides will work out differences before the deadline. &QL;

CLINTON ASKS PANEL TO ANALYZE SECURITY THREATS AT NUCLEAR LABS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Ala., Neb., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton asked an advisory panel Thursday
to analyze security threats at the Energy Department's nuclear
laboratories, after suspicions surfaced that China stole
nuclear-weapons designs from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am determined to do all that is necessary to protect our
sensitive national security information and to prevent its
diversion to foreign countries,'' Clinton said in announcing the
review by the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.
</P>
<P>
   The president's announcement was one of a series of steps the
administration has taken in recent days to try to reassure an angry
Congress and the public that it has tightened security to prevent
the transfer of sensitive technology information to China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the board would analyze how security threats had
evolved over two decades and what steps could be taken to counter
them.
</P>
<P>
   The president asked the board's chairman, Warren Rudman, a
former Republican senator from New Hampshire, to report back within
60 days. Clinton asked the board to deliver its report to Congress
and to release an unclassified version to the public ``to the
fullest extent possible consistent with our national security.''
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, had
recommended the review. Nuclear security has become a sensitive
issue in recent weeks after assertions have grown that China has
obtained American atomic data to help update its own warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The latest suspicions have focused on Wen Ho Lee, an American
engineer born in Taiwan, who was dismissed last week from his job
at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico for violating
security rules. He has not been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   There were clear signals Thursday that the nuclear security
issue will not abate soon.
</P>
<P>
   Berger was criticized by Sens. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and Bob
Kerrey, D-Neb., the chairman and ranking Democrat, respectively, of
the Senate Intelligence Committee. The senators said Berger's
recent comments that the administration had briefed Congress
repeatedly since 1996 about possible thefts of nuclear secrets by
China were ``misleading and inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelby and Kerrey said Berger left the impression that Congress
was lax about security at the labs when, in fact, lawmakers
familiar with intelligence issues had pushed the Energy Department
to strengthen security.
</P>
<P>
   The president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board was created
by President Eisenhower in 1956, abolished by President Carter in
1977 and reinstated by President Reagan in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Its members serve without compensation and review the
performance of all agencies engaged in gathering and evaluating
intelligence. Members have included distinguished scientists, while
its chairmen have typically been retired military officers or
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said four of the panel's 12 members would work with Rudman
on the inquiry. He said he did not know the identities of all four,
but that one was Sidney Drell, a Stanford University physicist who
heads the University of California president's council on the
laboratories. A number of the Energy Department labs are operated
by the University of California under contract to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji scheduled to visit
Washington next month, a Chinese diplomat in Washington played down
tension between the United States and China.

 &HT;    Hungry RedHawks expecting a win
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ On a basketball mystique scale of 1 to 10, the
University of Kentucky will take an advantage of about 10-2 into
today's Midwest Regional semifinal against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats have an 85-35 record in 41 NCAA appearances and
have won seven national championships, including two in the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The RedHawks have made 16 trips and have a 6-15 record. Until
last weekend, they had never won twice in the same tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But when Miami coach Charlie Coles was asked if he has any
concern about how his players would react to the UK aura, he shook
his head vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about that, I really don't,'' Coles said. ``I
worry about us. I'm constantly asking my players, `Are you full? Do
you have the same desire? Can we play in St. Louis the way we
played in New Orleans (where the 10th-seeded RedHawks upset No. 7
Washington and No. 2 Utah)?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to New Orleans as a very hungry team that wanted to
prove we were better than we played against Kent State (a loss in
the finals of the Mid-American Conference tournament).''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, Coles' players said they aren't full, that their
appetites have been only whetted, not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still hungry,'' point guard Rob Mestas said. ``Everybody
in the country knows about Kentucky and their tradition. We see
this as a chance to put Miami on the map, to show people we can
play with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Wally Szczerbiak, who is averaging 33.5 points a game in the
tournament, said, ``We really don't care what anyone thinks. No one
believed we could win two games in New Orleans except us and no one
believes we can go any further except us. And that's fine, that's
the way we like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burly forward John Estick put it even more succinctly. ``Of
course we're still hungry. If anyone's not still hungry, they're
pretty stupid. There's a lot more stuff to be won. Just because
we're in the Sweet 16, that's nothing. We want to get to the Final
Four, to show everyone we're a force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky utilizes a two-platoon system and no starter has
averaged 30 minutes. Four Miami starters _ Szczerbiak, Damon
Frierson, Mestas and Estick _ are averaging 34-plus minutes.
</P>
<P>
   UK opens with Wayne Turner (6-4), Desmond Allison (6-5), Heshimu
Evans (6-6), Scott Padgett (6-9) and Michael Bradley (6-10), then
brings in Saul Smith (6-2), Ryan Hogan (6-3), Taysham Prince (6-8),
Jamal Magloire (6-10) and Jules Camara (6-10).
</P>
<P>
   ``It came about because the guys in the second group have proved
they deserve playing time,'' said UK coach Tubby Smith. ``I don't
see them (the second group) as second-stringers. I see them as a
weapon for helping us wear down our opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak promised that the RedHawks will be ready, and aware
of how many players UK rotates in and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like this is going to be our first 40-minute game of
the year,'' Szczerbiak said. ``We've played 31 games and we didn't
come out (of the lineup) very often. You build up a threshold, a
tolerance. We're used to playing 40 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak said the RedHawks may even be able to use Kentucky's
tactics to their advantage. ``With a platoon system,'' he
explained, ``sometimes you get out of the flow of the game. If we
get off to a hot start, we'll be warmed up and ready to go and
they'll be cold because of the way they go in and out.

 &HT;    Murnens give Miami `a little something extra'
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The last basketball game Kurt Murnen saw was the
Miami RedHawks stumbling performance against Kent in the
Mid-American Conference tournament championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to poor defense and even worse shooting and ball
handling, Miami lost not only the game, 49-43, but apparently any
momentum heading into the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours later _ on the evening of March 4 _ Kurt
Murnen, 19 years old, died from complications of his 2-year battle
with bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the RedHawks had competed against Kurt, who had been an
Alter High basketball star, and the rest of the players knew him
from his visits to Oxford. Told in November that nothing more could
be done to stop the spread of his cancer, Kurt had refused to
concede and made several trips to Millett Hall to see Miami play.
</P>
<P>
   He had a special affection for this team and especially for his
older brother, Jay, who is the head student manager of the RedHawks
and has a life-and-death story of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Had his health somehow taken a turn for the better, Kurt had
planned to enroll in classes at Miami to be closer to Jay.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone noticed that the last time or two Kurt showed up at
Millett, he was so short of breath, he could not make it up the
gymnasium steps without resting every few feet. And when the news
of Kurt's death hit the team, it shook enough people that coach
Charlie Coles was glad Jay took a few minutes to address the
RedHawks players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys Kurt's last game was that one against Kent and
I guess he decided we needed some real help,'' Jay said. ``I told
them he finally decided to give up his fight, so he could give us a
little divine inspiration come tournament time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think he has. I think he helped us in that Washington
game and especially against Utah. Now, I just hope he shows up
against Kentucky. I really think he gives this team a little
something extra.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source, something has transformed a Miami team that
lost three of its last six MAC games. Now the RedHawks _ from
cover-boy hero Wally Szczerbiak and humanist coach Charlie Coles to
the unheralded support players who have turned giant killers in the
dispatches of seventh-seeded Washington and No. 2 seed Utah _ are
the most embraceable Cinderellas left in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into tonight's Sweet 16 matchup with Kentucky at the
Trans World Dome, Miami has made its storied tournament run fueled
_ in part _ on Kurt Murnen's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Before last Sunday's game against Utah, Szczerbiak _ the hottest
player in the tournament, averaging 33.5 points and 9.5 rebounds a
game _ looked into the CBS cameras at courtside and said the rest
of the postseason was dedicated to Kurt.
</P>
<P>
   And as the team headed to the dressing room for final
instructions, Szczerbiak caught up to Jay, grabbed him by the
shoulder and said, ``This one's for you.'' Later, that promise was
mentioned during the CBS broadcast, as cameras focused on Jay, who
keeps a program from his brother's funeral service in the breast
pocket of his jacket _ ``so it's right over my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Murnen stirs support and devotion from RedHawks players and
coaches because he's more than just a four-year manager and someone
who once tried out for the team. He's also The Comeback Kid _ a guy
whose dramatic story Coles has used to inspire his team during this
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Murnen brothers had both followed in the basketball
footsteps of their dad, Pat Murnen, the captain and a top
scholar-athlete of the University of Dayton basketball teams of the
late '60s and early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   After lettering in three sports at Alter, Jay went to Miami and
took on managing duties, as he contemplated a walk-on bid that
following season. But then one April night in 1996, while horsing
around with some buddies in his Emerson Hall dormitory, Jay tried
sliding down a banister and lost his balance.
</P>
<P>
   He plummeted nearly three floors, landing head-first on a
concrete floor. His skull was fractured, his collarbone broken and
he nearly died right there. A rescue team finally arrived and soon
he was taken by CareFlight to Miami Valley Hospital, where he
drifted between comatose and semi-comatose for three months.
</P>
<P>
   If he did live, doctors wondered if he would wake up. And then,
would he even be able to think, much less talk or walk?
</P>
<P>
   Progress was slow, but Jay had a guardian angel in Kurt, who was
at his bedside everyday, holding his hand, mopping his brow,
coaxing him to awaken. Finally, Kurt got his brother to wink and
then to write a word.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother pulled me back to life,'' Jay said.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Jay's status improved, Kurt was diagnosed with
bone cancer. Yet, even with his surgeries and chemotherapy, he
refused to shelve his basketball and before the season ended he was
playing with a shunt in his chest and a padded chest protector
beneath his Alter jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything that went on with me and then coping with my
brother, it wasn't always easy. I had some real down times,'' Jay
said. ``But one guy was always there for me. Charlie Coles really
took an interest. He'd bring me into his office, shut the door and
just talk. He wanted to know how I was doing, how Kurt was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ` `Jay Murnen is one of my good friends,'' Coles said. ``The kid
is tough for all he went through. And he's conscientious. You can
count on him for anything. He handled himself pretty well this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay said it wasn't easy: ``Every time we went on the road, I had
to call home and give Dad the number so they could reach me quick
if something happened. I knew right before the MAC tournament
things were bad. Before I left home I told Kurt I loved him and he
told me that he loved me, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole time we were in Toledo, I dreaded going back to my
hotel room. I didn't want the message light on my phone to be
blinking. Then, when we finally got back to Oxford, I called my
parents and asked them what was happening. They said, `We're here
with your brother...and he's dying.'''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jay got to Dayton, Kurt had died. Though devastated,
he was buoyed by the Miami team. Coles called and then three
coaches attended Kurt's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Kurt was buried, I went back to Miami that day,'' Jay
said. ``As soon as he saw me, Charlie hugged me. He told me,
`You've got support here. You're with people who love you.' And
I'll tell you, Miami basketball has been good for all of us now.
It's been a place I could put my mind into the last few weeks and
now my parents feel some of that, too. They're coming out here for
the Kentucky game.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Jay smiled: ``The way I see it _ Dad, Mom, me and
Kurt _ we'll all be here Friday night.

HOUSE APPROVES BILL TO CREATE MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following the Senate's lead, the House decisively
approved a bill on Thursday to field a system to defend the country
against a limited long-range missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a similar bill approved by the Senate on Wednesday, the
measure adopted by the House, 371-105, simply embraced the
principle of a national missile defense system. The Senate version
declares that the country install such a system ``as soon as
technologically possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House supports the Senate version, but not the House
bill, because the Senate measure explicitly backs continued
negotiations with Russia to reduce its still formidable nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters that the House
would probably accept the Senate's language when House and Senate
negotiators meet to reconcile differences between the two versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's action is a victory for the American people and their
personal security,'' Hastert said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The two bills have the strongest bipartisan support yet for a
system to defend against attacks from rogue nations like Iran and
North Korea, or missiles launched accidentally. China as well as
Russia has missiles capable of striking the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the mounting congressional pressure, and the more
menacing threats from North Korea and Iran, the White House
withdrew a veto threat of the Senate bill on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the 15-word House bill came after a rare 90-minute
closed briefing on the floor attended by about 250 lawmakers. The
legislators heard from former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld,
who headed a bipartisan commission that reported last year that
North Korea and Iran were much closer to developing a ballistic
missile threat than the Central Intelligence Agency had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate debated its version of the bill for three days,
adopting two amendments, the House Republican leadership barred all
amendments and wrapped up the House debate in one afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Senate bill, the House one does not authorize a
specific antimissile design or appropriate money to pay for it.
Indeed, the bill is so vague that its chief Democratic sponsor,
Rep. John Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, said lawmakers could read
into the measure whatever conditions they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   All but two Republicans _ Constance Morella of Maryland and
Vernon Ehlers of Michigan _ supported the bill. But Democrats were
sharply divided, with 103 for the bill and 102 against it.
</P>
<P>
   The lone independent, Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, voted
against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The two top Democrats, Reps. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the
minority leader, and David Bonior of Michigan, the minority whip,
opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's critics said the measure would commit the country to
spend billions of dollars on a defense that terrorist states could
circumvent with cruise missiles or car bombs. Rep. Lynn Woolsey,
D-Calif., said: ``What are really investing in? I fear what we'll
be investing in is a false sense of security.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics said the measure relied on as yet unproved
technology and also risked alienating Russia, which has conditioned
further reductions in its nuclear arsenal on Washington's
compliance with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. Fielding
an anti-missile system would require changes in that treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not do anything to advance the technological capacity
to protect our nation,'' said Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., ``and
could reverse efforts to reduce Russia's nuclear arsenal. This bill
is a blank check for defense contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters said the cost of a limited system _ now budgeted
at $10.5 billion _ would be well worth it. ``The cost of inaction
and the cost of vulnerability are much higher,'' said Rep. Jim
Turner, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said: ``Today, we live in an age
of ballistic missiles. Our adversaries are making faster and faster
missiles.''

MONEY DOESN'T CHANGE ANGELS' SPARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  TEMPE, Ariz. -- For those who hang out outside the ballpark
before games, waiting for your favorite ballplayers to arrive and
sign autographs, you are hereby notified that Angels pitcher Steve
Sparks might slip right past you.
</P>
<P>
   If you're watching for a Mercedes Benz with tinted windows to
pull into the parking lot, you might catch Mo Vaughn, but not
Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks is more likely to pull up in a mini-van.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Sparks can't afford a Mercedes -- he signed a
one-year contract during the off-season for $1.35 million. It's
just that Sparks, his wife Michelle and their two children (Alexa
and Blake and another on the way) have learned to live a frugal
lifestyle -- out of necessity.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when you spend nine years in the minor
leagues, in places like Helena, Montana and Beloit, Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks has spent the off-seasons working odd jobs, including one
as a substitute teacher near his home in Sugarland, Tex. As
recently as the fall and winter before the 1998 season, Sparks
would wait for that 5:30 a.m. phone call from the school district
office for the invitation to teach.
</P>
<P>
   This past off-season, Sparks was ``Mr. Mom, shuttling the kids
to and from school and taking care of household duties while
Michelle went to work. ``She takes care of everything during the
season, so it's my turn to help out, Sparks says.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the way Sparks and Michelle run their lives and
take care of the family. It has worked in the tough times, so
there's no reason to change, Sparks believes, now that he's making
good money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it'll change anything,'' said Sparks, 33.
``We're pretty much grounded in what we want to do with our lives.
I'm never not going to work. ... Neither of us grew up with much.
So we appreciate and are thankful for the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might super-size at McDonald's, or buy two-ply toilet
paper, but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks earned this year's salary because of last year's
performance. After joining the club in June, Sparks went 9-4 with a
4.34 ERA in 22 games (20 starts). He had a six-game winning streak
from June 29-Sept. 2 and pitched into the seventh inning or later
14 times.
</P>
<P>
   He was about as reliable as a knuckeballer can be, even though
there was no reason to expect anything from him.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks had reconstructive surgery on his right (pitching) elbow
after injuring it in spring training of 1997 while playing for the
Milwaukee Brewers. He didn't pitch at all in 1997 then went job
hunting after the Brewers released him. He called general manager
after general manager but found no takers until getting Angels
general manager Bill Bavasi on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we had some pretty good hitting clubs, and I
noticed if knuckleballers are on, there was really no defense
against them,'' Bavasi explained. ``And the hitters would be a
little off in the next game too. They'll give you a lot of innings
and a completely different look.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi agreed to give Sparks a shot, but Sparks didn't exactly
set the world on fire. He was 0-4 at double-A Midland and 0-4 at
triple-A Vancouver. The win-loss record was deceiving, though. It
wasn't an indication of how he was throwing, and the Angels called
him up on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a weapon not a lot of people have,'' Angels manager
Terry Collins said. ``And when it's working, he wins games. Right
now the challenge is making sure we have a guy who can catch him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Molitor said it was the best knuckleball he ever faced.
Coming from Paul Molitor, that was good enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks thought he had arrived in 1995, when he went 9-11 with a
4.63 ERA with the Brewers. That, after eight full seasons in the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subconsciously, after that year I felt I could pitch there for
a while,'' Sparks said. ``I didn't take it for granted, but
subconsciously I felt I belonged.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sparks found himself back in the minors for much of
1996, then blew out his elbow in spring of 1997 when he tried to
halt his throw on a relay to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally got another opportunity to pitch in the big
leagues with the Angels last season, Sparks went to the mound with
a do-or-die attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally felt every start I was pitching for my job, he
said. ``I put a lot of pressure on myself. I'll do the same this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this year, who knows? Sparks is well-aware that
knuckleball pitchers have a history of pitching well into their
40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel if I can stay in shape I can stay for a while,'' he
said. ``Some of those guys (knuckleballers) leave because of a knee
or a hip, not their arm.''

 &HT;    Good fortune, good decisions and hope bring O'Brien and his team
to Regional
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ He is 48 years old, Hollywood handsome with a
coif of white hair always combed perfectly. If you were casting a
college basketball coach, you would cast Jim O'Brien the moment he
walked into your office.
</P>
<P>
   That Ohio State did cast him two years ago after the Randy Ayers
Era became a never-ending parade of Buckeyes onto the police
blotter is almost as much a result of good fortune as it was a good
decision.
</P>
<P>
   First, two high-profile coaches, Rick Barnes and Tubby Smith,
had to turn down the Buckeyes, while another, Mike Montgomery, used
the leverage of the OSU opening to get himself a sweetheart deal at
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   File that in the good fortune category.
</P>
<P>
   Next, O'Brien was unhappy at his then-job at Boston College
because the school's admission office had just rejected two of his
prized recruits despite the fact they met all NCAA standards.
</P>
<P>
   File that in the good fortune category.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, OSU athletic director Andy Geiger decided despite
O'Brien's career coaching record of 235-217 at St. Bonaventure and
BC, that there was more to the man than the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   File that in the good decision category.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien came to Columbus in 1998 with a totally Eastern
background _ born and raised in Brooklyn; college star at BC;
coached in the East for 20 years, 15 as a head man. Predictably,
there was culture shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``After spending my entire adult life in the Northeast, I had no
idea how the other half lived,'' he said. ``My eyes have been
opened. When I was first contacted by Ohio State, guys would call
me and say, `You're involved with Ohio State?' I was like, `What's
so great about Ohio State?' Then I got here and said, `Oh, my God.
This is a great opportunity.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far it has been opportunity grabbed. When O'Brien's second
OSU team lined up Thursday night for the NCAA South Regional
semifinal against Auburn, it was the school's first visit to a
Regional in seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in March, O'Brien remembers ``going out and recruiting
my brains out'' during the week, then sitting at his house,
watching the tournament on TV on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of all the coaches who go to the tournament year
after year,'' he said. ``I was wondering if they truly appreciate
it. And I was thinking they couldn't appreciate it unless they
experienced the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd just experienced the other side: an 8-22 record that
included 1-15 in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where you want to be in March,'' he said. ``And the
best part of all this is what the players are feeling now. I've
been telling them from the beginning _ unless you've been here, you
don't know what you're missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what they were missing, but they didn't. Now they know.
And next year, the kids will know they want to get back here. You
can't overestimate how important that is.''
</P>
<P>
   In three of his last four years at BC, he had gone to a Regional
final in 1994 and been eliminated in the second round in both 1996
and '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last March was horrid,'' O'Brien said. ``But the players
didn't know. You can talk to them all you want. Other than Scoonie
(Penn), no one on this team knew. You don't appreciate all this
unless you struggle to get it. But once you get here, you want to
be here every year.''
</P>
<P>
   This year then will carry over to next. Whatever happened
against Auburn, that's O'Brien's hope.

   (REPEATING for all needing.)  
(EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
(sw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every weekday morning at around 11 o'clock, a middle-aged
stockbroker named Irvin Rosenfeld gets up from his desk and walks
to a breezeway outside his office in Boca Raton, Fla. There,
alongside the potted palms and smokers taking their breaks, he
lights up a cigarette of his own _ not tobacco, but marijuana, sent
to him by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is 16 years old and perfectly legal. Rosenfeld,
who suffers from a rare bone disorder and smokes to relieve his
pain, is part of an exclusive club of Americans who receive a free
can of marijuana cigarettes each month under a ``compassionate
use'' program sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration and
the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   There are only eight participants in the program. ``I'm one of
the fortunate people,'' Rosenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least, blessed with good timing. Since 1992 the door has
been shut on the little-known program, which began in 1978 and at
its height had no more than about 20 patients. Now, however, the
question of whether the government should be providing an illegal
drug to a chosen few has been thrust into the spotlight by a new
study showing that marijuana is beneficial for certain conditions,
including pain, nausea and the severe weight loss associated with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the most comprehensive review of the literature about
medical marijuana to date, was commissioned by the White House and
conducted by a committee of 11 scientists appointed by the
Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of
Sciences. A report on the study concluded that the benefits of
smoking marijuana were limited by the toxic effects of the smoke,
but nonetheless recommended that the drug be given under close
supervision to patients who do not respond to other therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it does not appear likely that the list of
government-approved marijuana smokers will grow any time soon.
Indeed, that the program continues to exist at all is testimony to
the government's schizophrenic approach to one of the thorniest
questions in law and medicine: whether doctors should be able to
write prescriptions for marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the National Institute on Drug Abuse pays the
University of Mississippi to grow what a spokeswoman called a
``consistent, reliable source of research-grade cannabis'' for
Rosenfeld and the seven other patients. A North Carolina
manufacturing plant receives $62,000 a year from the government to
roll the cigarettes and ship them in sealed tins of 300 each, to
the patients' doctors and pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld, 46, carries a folded-up letter in his wallet, dated
March 17, 1983, from the Food and Drug Administration, authorizing
him to use a substance that might otherwise bring a federal prison
term of up to five years. Most days, he smokes in his car while
driving to work; ``I get no euphoric effect,'' he said. The FDA
letter, he added, has been helpful on those rare occasions that the
police have pulled him over.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Congress has prevented the District of
Columbia from releasing the results of a recent ballot question
that asked voters to decide if marijuana should be made legal for
medical purposes. And the Clinton administration has moved to shut
down marijuana buyers' clubs in California and has threatened to
prosecute doctors who write prescriptions for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why allow eight patients to have legal access to marijuana but
criminalize thousands of other patients in very similar
circumstances who have the same conditions, virtually identical
medical histories?'' asked Chuck Thomas, spokesman for the
Marijuana Policy Project, a nonprofit group in Washington that
lobbies to make the drug legal for medical use. ``Why deny them
legal access?''
</P>
<P>
   That question is now before a federal judge in Philadelphia,
where 165 patients have filed a lawsuit seeking to force the FDA to
grant wider access to the drug. The case is scheduled for trial in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compassionate access program is an acknowledgment by the
government of the United States that marijuana has medicinal
value,'' said Lawrence Hirsch, the lawyer for the patients. ``It is
fundamentally unfair for the government to supply marijuana for
medical necessity to eight people in the United States, when the
rest of the potential candidates for therapeutic cannabis are
excluded.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Department of Justice argues the government is
simply upholding the law. Congress has made the possession and
distribution of marijuana illegal, a spokesman for the department
said, and the FDA has no obligation to make exceptions to the law
for anyone other than those who had legal access to marijuana
before the legislation was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have the precious exceptions owe them to a 51-year-old
glaucoma patient, Robert Randall of Sarasota, Fla. While the
Institute of Medicine has found marijuana is not particularly
useful for glaucoma, Randall begs to differ. In 1973, when he was a
college student in Washington, Randall said, he found that smoking
marijuana helped ease the pressure on his eyes.

 UNDATED: his eyes.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``So I grew four little marijuana plants on my sun deck on
Capitol Hill, to make up for those times that I couldn't afford to
buy it,'' he said. ``Then I got arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   As his case worked its way through the legal system, Randall
sued the federal government, contending that his smoking was a
``medical necessity.'' In 1976 a judge agreed, he said, and he
began receiving marijuana under the supervision of a doctor at
Howard University.
</P>
<P>
   But that arrangement unraveled in 1978, and he sued again. The
government settled the case through the compassionate use program,
under which the FDA gives patients access to unapproved drugs if no
other therapies will help them.
</P>
<P>
   Randall, who was the first enrollee, said the marijuana ``has
proved to be an astonishingly durable therapy.'' In the years after
the program began he helped others apply, among them Rosenfeld and
two Iowa patients, Barbara Douglass and Ladd Huffman, whose
experiences illustrate the arbitrary nature of the government's
decision to cut off access to the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Douglass and Huffman have multiple sclerosis, a
condition for which the Institute of Medicine found marijuana
beneficial. They met in 1990 after a local newspaper published an
article about Huffman, who had been arrested for growing the drug
in a shed behind his home. In 1991 they applied for federal
marijuana together.
</P>
<P>
   Both received FDA approval. Ms. Douglass began receiving the
drug shortly therafter. ``It relaxes the muscle spasms,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the program was shut down before the final paperwork was
finished for Huffman. A spokesman for the Department of Health and
Human Services said on Thursday that the department determined that
the marijuana was no longer necessary because of the advent of the
drug Marinol, a capsule containing marijuana's active ingredient
that was approved by the FDA in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Huffman says Marinol does not work. ``With these capsules, you
take them and about an hour later you get so stoned you can hardly
function,'' he said. But, having been sentenced to two years'
probation for his marijuana offense, he is afraid to smoke the drug
again.
</P>
<P>
   As for Rosenfeld, he has pangs of conscience, knowing that
people like Huffman have been prosecuted for buying a drug he gets
courtesy of the taxpayers. And he worries that his supply could be
cut off at any time, particularly if the government loses the
lawsuit in Philadelphia. ``I'm not against the government,'' he
said. ``I appreciate what they do for me.''

 (adds credit line)   Column: Why This Columnist Finds Boring the Obsession With Dow 
 10,000 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Two-and-a-half lousy points.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but this obsession with the industrials
closing above 10K is about as exciting as watching grass grow. That
is to say, it's slightly more scintillating than watching the
Senate put the president on trial when everybody knew the upper
house would never toss the Defendant in Chief out on his keister.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Dow, however, at least there's a snowball's
chance in Hades that history will repeat itself. Just as it took
more than six years for the Dow to close above 1,000 after first
hitting the mark, it might take another six years before the
storied stock market index reaches the latest but arbitrary
milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, probably not.
</P>
<P>
   There's a better chance that the industrials will close above
10,000 before the weekend starts. But don't expect me to be glued
to CNBC, I'll be outside cutting my lawn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KICKING IN:  &LR; San Francisco Soccer Development Corp., the
company that owns the San Francisco Bay Seals, has scored an
institutional shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Peacock Financial, a publicly held holding company that is
traded over the counter, has taken a 5 percent stake in the minor
league pro soccer team. What's more, Peacock has secured an option
to buy an additional 5 percent on top of that over the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for Peacock Financial of San Jacinto (Riverside
County) to swap $100,000 worth of its shares for 200,000 shares of
Seals stock. Of course, a hundred-thousand bucks wouldn't even
cover the minimum annual salary of an NBA bench warmer, but it's a
start.
</P>
<P>
   Another disconcerting thing is that Peacock isn't exactly GE
Financial. Still, it is an institutional shareholder nonetheless,
and that should help raise the profile of minor league soccer team
within the financial community, says Yan Skwara, director of
corporate finance for the Seals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being that Peacock is publicly traded, it continues to expose
the offering to Wall Street,'' Skwara says.
</P>
<P>
   Peacock, whose stock is trading at 15 cents a share on the OTC
Bulletin Board, is trying to rebound from a rocky real estate
development past, Skwara says.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: Investing in minor league soccer is mostly about
helping the world's most popular sport maintain its footing on
American turf. If you want to quadruple your money, may I suggest
you invest in an Internet stock with fat annual loss projections.
</P>
<P>
   As regular readers of Street Smarts may recall, this column
reported that the Seals minor league soccer club hopes to raise $1
million through a private placement. So far, a handful of
individuals have invested in the Seals, but Peacock is the first
investor to buy a block, Skwara says.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to note that Skwara is also the chief executive
of the San Diego Flash, which competes with the Seals in the same
league. Their teams are rivals in the top rung of the United Soccer
League, which is comparable to baseball's Triple A level. In a
spirit of cooperation that you aren't likely to find between, say,
the Raiders' Al Davis and the 49ers' Bill Walsh, Skwara has the
unusual role of also overseeing the Seals' corporate finance
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Why help a competitor raise money?
</P>
<P>
   Because professional soccer in the United States needs all the
financial help it can get, says Skwara, an investment banker and a
former stock broker.
</P>
<P>
   In short, raising the economic values of other teams should pump
up the price of his San Diego franchise, he says. He believes that
minor league soccer franchises could see their values increase
because the number of teams to be allowed in the United Soccer
League's top division is being capped at 32.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, thinking longer term, Skwara contends that San
Diego and the northern Bay Area deserve to have big-league soccer
and that both the Flash and Seals could possibly join Major League
Soccer some day. (The Bay Area's lone major league franchise is the
San Jose Clash.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our business plan for both the Flash and Seals to
become Major League Soccer franchises,'' Skwara muses.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Major League Soccer would have to drastically revamp
its policies and financial structure for its franchises to see
significant leaps in value. But Skwara is betting that the sport's
top professional league is moving in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Skwara plans to implement an alternative exit
strategy for investors. The Flash's CEO plans to take his soccer
franchise public in June.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego club is wrapping up a $1 million private placement
similar to the one now in progress for the Seals. Once that is
done, the Flash is expected to offer stock to the public for about
$5 a share in June.
</P>
<P>
   The offering is expected to be managed by Lloyd Wade Securities
of Dallas, which currently owns about 2,000 shares of the Flash,
and First Midwest Securities of Milwaukee, which was the lead
manager of a 1997 IPO for the Orlando Predators of the Arena
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that we can execute this offering effectively,''
Skwara predicts.
</P>
<P>
   He has reasons to be optimistic. The Flash expects to grow
merchandising revenues, is talking to San Diego officials about a
possible new stadium and has had a corporate sponsor for more than
a year. Delta Air Lines provides free airline tickets to the team
worth upwards of $50,000 in exchange for marketing rights. (A
similar deal between the Seals and Delta was just cut this week.)
</P>
<P>
   And if the Flash's IPO is successful, don't be surprised if
Skwara plans a similar offering for the Seals. That, of course,
assumes that the San Francisco team sells out its private placement
first.

$6 MILLION HELD FOR CUBA MUST GO TO U.S. FAMILIES, JUDGE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A federal judge ruled Thursday that more than $6.2
million owed to Cuba by telephone companies in the United States
must now be paid to the families of three Cuban-Americans who were
killed in 1996 when their planes were shot down over international
waters by Cuban fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James King ordered that the money, part of
an estimated $19 million in payments to Cuba held in escrow because
of legal wrangling over the attack, be released to the fliers'
relatives, a move that seems to clear the way for garnishment of
other Cuban assets.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over this money, owed to Cuban communications
company Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba SA by AT&AMP;T and other
companies, is why Cuba suspended direct dial telephone service to
the United States on Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this is a step in the direction of justice, but our
goal is to have the criminals behind bars,'' said Miriam De la
Pena, whose son, Mario De la Pena, was among four pilots killed on
Feb. 4, 1996, while searching for Cuban rafters in the Florida
Straits.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban MIGs shot down two small planes, killing De la Pena and
three other members of the Miami organization Brothers to the
Rescue, prompting the families of three of the fliers to sue the
Cuban Air Force and the Republic of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   They won a judgment of $187 million in 1997, but had no way to
collect the money _ officials in Havana ignored the judgment _
until they went to federal court in Miami to try to seize Cuban
assets in the United States. They sought the money owed to the
Cuban government by American companies that provided long-distance
telephone service to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Today, King ruled that the fliers' relatives were entitled to
$6.2 million _ part of about $19 million _ from AT&AMP;T, MCI
International Inc., and other American companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reviewing the court's opinion and considering our
options to appeal,'' said Dianne Bernez, a spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T,
which had the largest amount _ more than $4 million _ affected by
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernez said that AT&AMP;T believed that Empresa de
Telecomunicaciones, a venture between the Cuban government and an
Italian communications corporation, ``is an independent legal
entity that is not liable for the deaths'' of the fliers.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the fliers' relatives argued that the Cuban
telephone company was largely owned and controlled by the Communist
government, and that the government was liable for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also said that the ruling may clear the way for
other garnishments involving business between Cuba and U.S.
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling goes against the wishes of President Clinton and his
advisers, who had argued that the long-standing U.S. trade embargo
with Cuba prohibited any financial dealings with the Cuban
government, including garnishments, unless specifically permitted
by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Cuban government's decision to sever the telephone
links between the U.S. communications companies and Cuba,
long-distance telephone service was never really cut off to the
island, because calls were rerouted through other countries, like
Mexico, and placed by companies not named in the lawsuit.

DUKE'S WILLIAM AVERY ERASES ALL DOUBTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In retrospect, it seems absurd. Duke, a
team that has won 34 of 35 games by an average margin of 26 points,
started the season with this unanswered question:
</P>
<P>
   Could sophomore William Avery replace point guard Steve
Wojciechowski?
</P>
<P>
   Wojciechowski was the emotional and spiritual leader of last
year's team that finished 32-4. He was a scrappy player who made
the most of limited ability. Avery was clearly a talented player,
but as a freshman he got few chances to show his ability to run a
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year he was more of a hired gun,'' said sophomore center
Elton Brand. ``He got in the game and started jacking it up. He
didn't care, he kept shooting and shooting; he was more worried
about the points.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the points are still there (15.1 per game). But so
are the assists (5.2 per game). Avery, a 6-foot-2, 185-pounder, has
proven that he can run Duke's offense and spark its defense.
Whether it is half-court or full-court, Avery is in the driver's
seat of the Blue Devils' 93-points-a-game machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had probably the most important, terrific year of all of
our kids,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ``We had the belief he
would be really good, but he's been better. He's a very hard worker
and wants to learn. He prepares well. He really likes to play and
I've tried to give him a lot of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   During the recruiting process, Krzyzewski questioned Avery's
grades, which were borderline for Duke. After the meeting, Avery
firmly told his mother: ``I'm going to Duke.'' He attended Oak Hill
Academy in Virginia, a prep school, to improve his grades and his
game.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Avery averaged 8.5 points and 2.5 assists per game.
His inconsistent freshman season planted the seeds of doubt coming
into this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what people were saying, and I took it as a
challenge,'' Avery said. ``I like challenges. I wanted to prove to
everyone that I could do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand, Avery's roommate, leads Duke in scoring and rebounding.
But the sophomore center says that Avery is the Blue Devils' most
valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   And Avery seems intent on proving his roomie's theory. When
senior Trajan Langdon was sidelined for three games with a broken
foot recently, Avery, the team's only other true guard, scored 55
points and made 9 of 20 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm aggressive and attacking, the team plays that way,''
said Avery, a native of Augusta, Ga. ``A point guard has to lead,
whether by example or by being vocal. I'm more of an example guy
and not that vocal. I'm more vocal now than I have ever been in my
basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a natural thing for me. It's something I've had to
work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery had a career-high 30 points against Cincinnati. That was
Duke's only loss, but Avery's feathery-soft runner from the
baseline tied the score at 75-all. He's shooting a remarkable 50
percent from the field, 41 percent on his 3-pointers and 81 percent
from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's showed everyone he can move this team to
victory,'' Brand said. ``He's playing a great floor game, he's
getting assists, scoring, playing great defense. That's all you can
ask in a point guard.''

   KOSOVO POLJE, Yugoslavia _ ``So, is NATO going to bomb us?'' As
Serbian soldiers and police officers drank coffee and cognac
Thursday in the shabby Cafi Marko on the main street, the same
question kept cropping up.
</P>
<P>
   It was mostly rhetorical. The threat of NATO air strikes has
grown familiar over the last few months and few Serbs seem to think
that they will actually happen now. ``Anyway, we don't care,'' said
a policeman, who declined to give his name. ``It is not important
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue that is far more important to Serbs living in Kosovo
province is whether a NATO-led military force will come to enforce
a peace settlement. Serbs are violently opposed to the plan, which
will give ethnic Albanians self-rule in Kosovo, and they place the
blame for the idea squarely on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lived here for centuries,'' the policeman said. ``We
don't want any foreign troops. Your army has nothing to do in my
country.''
</P>
<P>
   A 21-year-old Yugoslav Army soldier who would identify himself
only as Ceda said, ``If necessary we will fight them but we will
never accept them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two armies in Kosovo, the Kosovo Liberation Army and
the Yugoslav Army,'' he said, referring to the ethnic Albanian
guerrillas who are fighting for independence and the government
forces who are battling them. ``We want only our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Civilians living in Kosovo Polje, a Serbian settlement several
miles outside the provincial capital, Pristina, speak in the same
way. ``We do not need anyone to defend our people,'' said Dusanka
Bauk, a 71-year-old grandmother who fought with the partisans in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers rescuing two British pilots downed over Serbia
during the war. ``They were young and handsome,'' she said. ``One
told my father, `I will come back after the war and take your
daughter.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But she remains adamant that the arrival of NATO peacekeepers in
Kosovo would be bad because the force would not be a neutral one.
``The West supports the Albanians and they are fighting against
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bauks have lived in Kosovo Polje for 60 years. Like every
Serb, they cite the famous battle of Kosovo Polje in 1389 against
the Ottoman Turks as evidence of their right to the lands of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the heartland of Serbia,'' said Djura Bauk, Dusanka's
husband and a retired mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Bauk, his son, said: ``How can it not be important? It
represents our history and our ancestors. We never attack, but we
always defend our country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Bauk family are strong supporters of Slobodan Milosevic and
were there to hear his now notorious speech in Kosovo Polje in
1989, when he first raised the banner of Serbian nationalism.
``Super, it was super,'' said Dusanka Bauk, nodding firmly.
</P>
<P>
   They support his policy of reversing Kosovo's autonomy and his
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the province. They argue that
Albanian villages are only being attacked now because they harbor
rebel terrorists, and they deny that civilians are suffering.
</P>
<P>
   They think little of the peace agreement being proposed at peace
talks in Paris and certainly do not want to see the ethnic
Albanians achieve self-rule in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here in my own land and I do not need to negotiate with
anyone,'' said Djura Bauk, the most strident member of the family.
He said he would never accept Albanian rule in Kosovo, because it
would lead to oppression of the Serbs, who are outnumbered by
Albanians nine to one in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Bauks say that the Albanians are all wealthier than the
Serbs in Kosovo and own land, livestock and cars. ``They have more
money,'' Dragan Bauk said. ``You can see we do not have money.'' He
quit his low-paying job as a laboratory technician at Pristina
University and survives from a tiny videotape copying and rental
business at home.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the Serbs in Kosovo Polje will countenance giving up
and leaving the province.
</P>
<P>
   There is an underlying threat to the ethnic Albanians that
surfaces in conversations with Serbs. Ceda, the young soldier,
warned that if NATO bombed, Serbs would take revenge on ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO bombs us, we will push the Albanians out, because they
are guilty,'' he said. ``We do not want what is not ours, we just
want our own territory, to live in peace and have no one fight us.
But the Albanians do not want that.''
</P>
<P>
   But amid the threats, the denials and the stock phrases of state
propaganda, the Serbs show a desire for normality.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did we do?'' Ceda said. ``Why does all the world hate us.
What are we in Kosovo, aliens or something, that everyone hates
us?''

NEWS ANALYSIS: LONG-SHOT HOUSE VOTE TO LIMIT STEEL IMPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With surprising force and fury, the House vote to limit steel
imports reflects a strong sense of frustration within the domestic
steel industry over low-price steel that landed on U.S. shores
during economic crises in Asia and Russia last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure, a violation of world trade rules and a
long-shot at best in the Senate, would do little to help the U.S.
steel industry in the long run, even if the measure _ or a form of
it _ were to be enacted. The industry is still losing about 10,000
jobs a year, is saddled with plants that are very expensive to run
and is constantly buffeted by economic forces beyond its control
from lands far away.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, this measure, decried as a protectionist gift to
gain union votes for the 2000 election by both parties, comes as
the U.S. steel industry begins to recover from the wave of imports
that drove down steel prices to 25-year lows last year. The
industry is about to benefit from a growing demand for steel
products from an economy that continues to remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   That is the good news for the short run. Within the next year,
analysts expect that there will be enough demand to keep U.S. steel
manufacturers running at full capacity. Just this month, steel
makers pushed through a price increase and have seen that imports,
which last year caused havoc in steel prices, are now beginning to
return to more normal levels _ in January 1999 steel imports came
to 2.7 million tons, compared with 2.5 million tons the previous
January.
</P>
<P>
   Still, U.S. steel makers fear that what happened to them in late
1998, when low-cost imports from Japan, Russia, Brazil and other
economically troubled countries soared to nearly 4 million tons a
month, or nearly 40 percent of the domestic market, will happen
again. They contend that the industry, which faces falling
employment and marginal profitability, cannot sustain a similar
blow.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, even though many in the steel industry readily
admit that the House's 289-141 vote for import limits was largely
symbolic, it represents a renewed belief in the need for
protectionist measures _ a view that free-trade advocates say is
dangerous and which runs afoul of the Clinton administration's
free-market views. A presidential veto remains possible. In fact,
the House-passed measure is the first in a package of about eight
trade bills that the steel industry and unions want to see
introduced in the 106th Congress. The measure would limit steel
imports to pre-1997 levels, in violation of World Trade
Organization rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``This measure is both symbolic and real,'' said Curtis ``Hank''
Barnette, the chief executive of Bethlehem Steel, who will speak on
behalf of the bill before the Senate Finance Committee next
Tuesday. ``We are actively working with other steel companies and
the unions to carry our message as forcefully as we can. We're
pleased that the House has recognized what we are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America,
also praised the measure. ``With 10,000 steelworkers already out of
work, three major steel producers in bankruptcy, another on the
brink, and virtually every steel producer experiencing huge losses,
action isn't an option; it's an absolute necessity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, say that the steel industry's concerns are
overstated and that their approach is dangerous _ a continuation on
a decades-old pattern of calling on Washington for help. ``This is
very blatant politicking on behalf of Congress to appeal to special
interests in the steel industry and unions,'' said Waldo Best, an
analyst with Morgan Stanley. ``It creates the image that something
is being done, but nothing is really being done. This is a very
political piece of legislation that won't do anything meaningful
for the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Crandall, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research group, said the measure
``doesn't mean much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the surge of imports had some effects
on steel makers, but this measure will have little impact on the
industry in the long run,'' he said. ``The real problem for
old-line big steel is that they are being eaten alive by the
mini-mills, which are making life miserable for these big guys. We
are talking about a long-drawn out end game for big steel.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last half-century, the American steel industry has
continued to shrink; today it has about 170,000 employees compared
with 500,000 in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   And, while the steel producers complain about low-cost imports,
users of steel benefit. General Motors Corp., for instance, opposes
the limits. ``We are in opposition to this resolution and think
it's a rush to judgment that will probably have serious economic
implications,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas steel producers often operate in the same way as big
steel makers here but, at times of economic turmoil in their home
countries, they have shipped steel products to the United States at
extremely low prices in an attempt to to stabilize their economies.
These overseas producers often have far lower labor costs than in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hoffman, a steel analyst with Prudential Securities, said
that by the time United States steel companies _ which have
successfully filed anti-dumping suits against Brazil and Japan _
got relief in the form of high tariff protections, the crisis would
have passed. Moreover, Hoffman said the House vote also reflected
anti-Clinton sentiment both in the House and in the industry over
the administration's slow response.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of free trade and some steel importers were adamant
in their opposition to import restrictions. ``This is one of the
worst pieces of legislation to come out of the House, and that's
saying a lot,'' said Dan Griswold, associate director for trade
policy studies at the Cato Institute. ``There is not a steel crisis
issue. Just look at the high level of steel shipments.''
</P>
<P>
   David Phelps, the executive director of the American Institute
for International Steel, a trade group, added: ``The steel industry
is historically addicted to trade protection and that addiction has
yet to be broken. We hope the Senate will give this ridiculous bill
the indecent burial it deserves.'' &QL;

NORTHROP GRUMMAN TO RESTATE RESULTS FOR A WRITE-OFF LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Northrop Grumman Corp. said Thursday that it would
restate its results for the fourth quarter of 1998, taking a loss
because of a write-off associated with an investment in a start-up
rocket company.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop said it had written off $30 million it had provided to
Kistler Aerospace Corp. because of uncertainty over Kistler's
ability to raise the money needed to complete its K-1 re-usable
launcher vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Northrop will report a loss for the fourth quarter
of $3 million, or 4 cents a diluted share, rather than the net
profit of $17 million, or 24 cents a share, the company announced
in February. The adjustment is being made to fourth-quarter
earnings because the company has not yet filed its yearly financial
statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement is the latest in a series of jolts to
its earnings that the big military contractor experienced in the
last year, when the company was hurt by the collapse of its planned
acquisition by Lockheed Martin Corp., cutbacks in production by
Boeing Co., a major customer, and problems with some military
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement also reflects the financial challenges facing
the small companies trying to develop re-usable launcher vehicles
that could hoist satellites into orbit far more cheaply than either
the space shuttle or the expendable rockets now used.
</P>
<P>
   Of these companies, Kistler, based in Kirkland, Wash., is
considered the front-runner and the best financed, having already
raised $450 million. Its chief executive, George Mueller, headed
the Apollo project and other manned space programs at NASA. And the
company has already signed up a customer, Space Systems/Loral,
which agreed to pay more than $100 million for 10 launchings.
</P>
<P>
   But Kistler, which needs to raise several hundred million
dollars more, canceled a $300 million junk-bond offering last year
after market conditions soured. When the rocket company ran short
of cash, Northrop, which has a $145 million contract to build
composite structures for the Kistler launcher, deferred payment on
$30 million worth of work.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the two companies agreed to convert that debt into
preferred stock in Kistler, but Northrop and its auditors
determined that the investment had to be written off.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Waugh, Northrop's chief financial officer, said in a
statement that his company still thinks Kistler's concept ``has
significant promise for future business.'' He said Northrop would
invest an additional $30 million before the first test flight if
the K-1 program remained viable. Northrop also has the option to
purchase up to $120 million more in stock, Kistler officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Kistler's launcher will be based on engines developed by the
Soviet Union for its moon program but never used. The vehicle's two
stages will return to earth using parachutes and air bags. Kistler
hopes to conduct its first test flight early next year from the
Australian desert.

 &HT;    Red Storm blows away Terps
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Now Maryland knows how Indiana suffered. Five
days after handing the Hoosiers their worst NCAA Tournament defeat,
St. John's stormed to 19-point halftime lead, extended it to 26,
then withstood a frantic Maryland rally for a 76-62 win Thursday
night in the NCAA South Region semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Barkley's 24 points put third-seeded St. John's (28-8)
into Saturday's final and leaves the Red Storm one win shy of its
first Final Four since 1985. No. 2 seed Maryland, meanwhile,
finishes 28-6 and, as ever, still looking for its first Final Four
appearance after a disastrous dry spell late in the first half that
allowed St. John's to close with a 19-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   For Maryland, Laron Profit knew, the time was now after a season
spent in Duke's shadow. ``Maryland has been on the cusp of
greatness and had their opportunities,'' he'd said, alluding to the
John Lucas-Len Elmore teams of the early '70s, the Len Bias teams
of the '80s, the Joe Smith teams of the '90s _ none of which had
ever reached the Final Four. ``We feel like this is our
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only for Maryland basketball, but we're being a little
selfish,'' said the senior swingman. ``This is our last time around
and we want to go out with a bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Profit and Co. were quickly living one last nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The night began promisingly enough. After St. John's took an
early 9-4 lead, the Terps quickly drew even on two free throws and
a 3-pointer by Terence Morris. Then Steve Francis scored on a drive
for his first basket. It was also his last in a disastrous first
half for Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   As it had in last Saturday's destruction of Indiana, St. John's
began in man-to-man defense, then switched to a 2-3 zone. The zone
undid Maryland, as it had Indiana. Profit hit a pull-up jumper over
the zone for a 19-18 Terps lead. Then St. John's rained on the
Terps.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland missed its last 10 shots of the half. The Terps also
committed eight of their 13 first-half turnovers once St. John's
went to a zone. And playing as tough and unselfishly as they did
against Indiana, the Johnnies blew it open with a 20-0 rush to
close the half.
</P>
<P>
   With Maryland center Lonnie Baxter sitting out the last 17
minutes of the first half after drawing two quick fouls, St. John's
dominated inside. The front line of Ron Artest, Lavor Postell and
Tyrone Grant combined for 15 points and 11 boards.
</P>
<P>
   But the backcourt ruled, too. Bootsy Thornton torched Maryland's
man-to-man for nine points (4-for-8 from the floor) and Barkley,
the point guard, had eight points and seven assists. In the second
half, St. John's opened up a 22-point bulge, 41-19, before Brian
Watkins finally tipped in yet another Maryland miss. It was the
Terps' first points in 10:27.

 &HT;    Late put-back sends Gonzaga past Florida
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Casey Calvary's tip-in with 4.4 seconds remaining
helped Gonzaga continue its surprising tournament run Thursday with
a 73-72 victory over Florida in the West Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Gonzaga (28-6) advances to Saturday's regional
final against the winner of the Connecticut-Iowa semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 72-71 with less than 10 seconds remaining, Gonzaga's
Quentin Hall drove the lane and attempted a running jumper which
bounced high off the back of the rim. Calvary raced down the lane
and tapped in Hall's miss for the basket and the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (22-9) had a chance to win the game, but Eddie Shannon
missed a 3-pointer from the right corner as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Florida took its first lead, 39-37, just 59 seconds into the
second half when Kenyan Weaks stole the ball at the top of the key,
drove for a layup and was fouled. The advantage was short-lived,
however, as Gonzaga guard Richie Frahm tossed in a long
three-pointer to key a 12-3 run over the next six minutes. Calvary
helped establish an inside game with two rebound buckets and two
foul shots off a follow.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators used a 14-1 run late in the first half to overcome a
26-13 deficit and tie the game at 27, but still trailed 35-34 at
intermission. Given their sloppy play and inability to defend the
three-point shot, coach Billy Donovan's club was fortunate to be
within a single point.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga nailed seven of 12 3-pointers in the opening 20 minutes
but the Bulldogs' reliance on the trey also proved disastrous at
times. Three times they turned the ball over by trying to float
skip-passes over the Florida defense and the miscues led to two
easy baskets and a shooting foul for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Especially sloppy for Gonzaga was point guard Quentin Hall,
whose three assists in the half were offset by five turnovers.
Shooting guard Matt Santangelo, the Bulldogs' best perimeter
player, mirrored his backcourt mate's inconsistency. After hitting
two treys in the opening five minutes, Gonzaga's sharpshooter
missed seven straight shots.
</P>
<P>
   The teams played poorly in the opening 10 minutes. Not
surprisingly, Donovan, whose team features 11 players averaging
over 10 minutes per game, tried to wear down a Gonzaga club with
only 10 players on its entire roster. Donovan made 24 substitutions
in the half.

 &HT;    Red Storm blows away Terps
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Now Maryland knows how Indiana suffered. Five
days after handing the Hoosiers their worst NCAA Tournament defeat,
St. John's stormed to 19-point halftime lead, extended it to 26,
then withstood a frantic Maryland rally for a 76-62 win Thursday
night in the NCAA South Region semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Barkley's 24 points put third-seeded St. John's (28-8)
into Saturday's final and leaves the Red Storm one win shy of its
first Final Four since 1985. No. 2 seed Maryland, meanwhile,
finishes 28-6 and, as ever, still looking for its first Final Four
appearance after a disastrous dry spell late in the first half that
allowed St. John's to close with a 19-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   For Maryland, Laron Profit knew, the time was now after a season
spent in Duke's shadow. ``Maryland has been on the cusp of
greatness and had their opportunities,'' he'd said, alluding to the
John Lucas-Len Elmore teams of the early '70s, the Len Bias teams
of the '80s, the Joe Smith teams of the '90s _ none of which had
ever reached the Final Four. ``We feel like this is our
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only for Maryland basketball, but we're being a little
selfish,'' said the senior swingman. ``This is our last time around
and we want to go out with a bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Profit and Co. were quickly living one last nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The night began promisingly enough. After St. John's took an
early 9-4 lead, the Terps quickly drew even on two free throws and
a 3-pointer by Terence Morris. Then Steve Francis scored on a drive
for his first basket. It was also his last in a disastrous first
half for Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   As it had in last Saturday's destruction of Indiana, St. John's
began in man-to-man defense, then switched to a 2-3 zone. The zone
undid Maryland, as it had Indiana. Profit hit a pull-up jumper over
the zone for a 19-18 Terps lead. Then St. John's rained on the
Terps.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland missed its last 10 shots of the half. The Terps also
committed eight of their 13 first-half turnovers once St. John's
went to a zone. And playing as tough and unselfishly as they did
against Indiana, the Johnnies blew it open with a 20-0 rush to
close the half.
</P>
<P>
   With Maryland center Lonnie Baxter sitting out the last 17
minutes of the first half after drawing two quick fouls, St. John's
dominated inside. The front line of Ron Artest, Lavor Postell and
Tyrone Grant combined for 15 points and 11 boards.
</P>
<P>
   But the backcourt ruled, too. Bootsy Thornton torched Maryland's
man-to-man for nine points (4-for-8 from the floor) and Barkley,
the point guard, had eight points and seven assists. In the second
half, St. John's opened up a 22-point bulge, 41-19, before Brian
Watkins finally tipped in yet another Maryland miss. It was the
Terps' first points in 10:27.

 &HT;    Gonzaga grabs win against Florida
 &HT;    By Leo Willingham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cinderella is alive and well in the West Region of the
NCAA Tournament. In fact, she's only one win away from the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga continued its surprising tournament run Thursday by
defeating Florida 73-72 in the region semifinals in Phoenix.
Trailing by one in the final seconds, Gonzaga's Casey Calvary
tapped in a missed shot by Quentin Hall for a one-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Florida had a chance to win, but Eddie Shannon's 3-point attempt
bounced off the rim at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (28-6), who had never won an NCAA Tournament game
before this year, Saturday will face the winner of the
Connecticut-Iowa semifinal for a berth to the Final Four. Gonzaga,
making only its second NCAA appearance in school history, opened a
10-point first-half lead and held off a late run by Florida (22-9),
which was making its first Sweet 16 appearance in five years.
</P>
<P>
   In the South Regional, St. John's (28-8) routed Maryland 76-62
to move within a game of its first Final Four appearance since
1985. St. John's closed the first half with a 20-0 run, opening a
38-19 halftime, and survived a 19-2 spurt by Maryland in the second
half to advance to its first regional final since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Barkley scored 24 points to lead St. John's, which will
play the winner of the Auburn-Ohio State semifinal Saturday for a
trip to the Final Four. Maryland (28-6), which tied its lowest
scoring output of the season in the loss, was eliminated in the
region semifinals for the fourth time in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kentucky (27-8) will continue its quest for a second straight
title tonight when it faces surprising Miami of Ohio (24-7) in the
Midwest semifinals. Kentucky, which has won 19 of its last 20
tournament games over the last four years, will have to contend
with Miami senior Wally Szczerbiak, who has scored 67 points in two
tournament games. The other Midwest semifinal matches top seed
Michigan State (31-4), which has won 20 straight, against 13th seed
Oklahoma (22-10), the lowest seed remaining in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   _ Southwest Missouri State (22-10) will become the latest team
to attempt to halt Duke's run to the Final Four as the teams meet
in an East semifinal. Southwest Missouri State, the 12th seed,
upset Wisconsin and Tennessee in its first two games, but will face
a Duke (34-1) squad that has won 29 straight, including 41-point
victories in its two tournament games. Temple (23-10) meets Purdue
(21-12) in the other East semifinal.

AMERICA WEST AND UNION CONTINUE CONTRACT TALKS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Nev.)  (rk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America West Airlines and its flight attendants met in
Washington for a second day of federally mediated talks Thursday in
an attempt to reach an agreement before a strike deadline at
midnight Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Flight Attendants, the union that represents
America West's 2,200 flight attendants, has said that if there is
no settlement it will take action that could potentially cripple
the airline, the country's ninth largest.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of walking out in unison, as in a traditional
strike, the flight attendants said they would stage brief walkouts
or selectively target America West flights, flying some and
refusing to fly others.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, which the union calls CHAOS, for Creating Havoc
Around Our System, is intended to exert maximum pain on the airline
while still allowing most of the flight attendants _ who are among
the lowest-paid airline employees _ to collect their paychecks. It
has been used only once before, at Alaska Airlines in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Union members held a mock lottery at Phoenix Skyharbor
International Airport on Wednesday, drawing the names of
destinations that might be affected in case of a strike. (The union
would not say what its first strike actions would be.)
</P>
<P>
   But the mere threat of disruption has already hurt America West.
``We are booking people on other flights,'' said Larry Reder, the
general manager of Global Wide Travel in Phoenix, where America
West is based and where it flies 41 percent of the scheduled
service at Skyharbor. ``However, all the other carriers are pretty
much sold out. It is becoming a tight situation.''
</P>
<P>
   America West Holdings, the airline's parent, said Thursday that
it was committed to averting a strike. ``We believe that a
negotiated settlement remains possible,'' the company said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also said that it may shut down the carrier in the
event of a job action. And on Wednesday, it threatened to dismiss
any attendant who participated in a CHAOS action, a move that the
union said was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   A shutdown at America West, which flew about 4 percent of all
domestic passengers last year, would not create as much disruption
as last month's sickout by pilots at American Airlines, the
nation's second-largest carrier.
</P>
<P>
   But tourism officials in both Phoenix and Las Vegas, Nev., where
America West is second in size only to Southwest Airlines,
expressed concern. March is the peak tourist season in Arizona, and
both spring break and Easter are approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have literally thousands of people planning to
travel here in the next few weeks,'' said Brent DeRaad, a spokesman
for the Greater Phoenix Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The union and the airline have been trying to agree on a
contract since 1994, when the flight attendants first voted to
unionize. The union's members overwhelmingly rejected a previous
tentative agreement in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The main issue in the current negotiations is pay. The two sides
are only $16.5 million apart, a sum that spread over a five-year
contract amounts to $3.3 million a year. American West Holdings
earned $108 million on a little more than $2 billion in sales in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the airline has said that it cannot afford to pay more than
its last offer and still remain competitive with its much larger
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   America West flight attendants start at a salary of $12,800 a
year and rise to $22,000 after 12 years. Some earn more than the
maximum because of overtime, but the average pay is about $20,000,
according to the union, a reflection of the fact that about
two-thirds of the attendants have been with the airline more than
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The company has offered to raise pay an average of 45 percent
over five years and to increase the daily expense payment the
flight attendants now receive when they are away from home by 46
percent, to $1.30 an hour at the beginning of the contract with
additional increases to $1.75 an hour by the end.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a letter sent to each attendant on Feb. 12, William A.
Franke, America West's chairman and chief executive, said that the
offer equaled 90 percent of what rival Southwest Airlines pays its
flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The union disputed this and said that the company needed to put
more money on the table. But heading into the latest round of
negotiations on Wednesday, William McGlashen, president of the
union local, said an offer that truly equaled 90 percent of
Southwest's contract ``may form the basis for a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier this month, McGlashen said that the
union did not feel that it would receive the company's best offer
until just before the strike deadline. But he also said that after
nearly five years of increasingly acrimonious relations with
Franke, many of the flight attendants were so embittered that they
might not endorse a contract until management ``felt some pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of America West rose 75 cents Thursday, to $18.25 on the
New York Stock Exchange.

AT DUKE, KRZYZEWSKI REBUILDS AS HIS WIFE KEEPS SCORE AND HIS
ASSISTANTS ASSIST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coach almost did not hear the whistle because it was blown
far from a basketball court by someone who had never called a foul
on him before: his wife. It was January 1995 and Mickie Krzyzewski
felt like a failure. Her husband, Mike, was a superstar basketball
coach and she was afraid it was killing him.
</P>
<P>
   He had led teams from Duke to seven Final Four appearances and
to consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Association
championships in 1991 and 1992 and became a poster boy for running
a program with academic and athletic integrity.
</P>
<P>
   But Mickie saw someone different _ a husband and father who was
distracted, a coach who was obsessed, a man who was physically
hurting.
</P>
<P>
   Three months earlier, Krzyzewski had had back surgery to repair
a herniated disk. The doctors told him to take several weeks of
rest. He took one. By January, the coach was in pain, his wife was
exasperated and the whistle blew in the Krzyzewski's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Mickie Krzyzewski told her husband that she had made a doctor's
appointment for him that day; Mike told her he had to go to
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only time I've ever done this in 30 years of
marriage,'' she said. ``I told him to go see that doctor or don't
come home. Then I sat in that waiting room and prayed he would show
up.''
</P>
<P>
   He did show up, and he was hospitalized for fatigue. Krzyzewski
was told to relinquish his team and he did that, too, sitting out
the rest of the season. From flat on his back he began an arduous
rebuilding feat that has nothing and everything to do with
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   What is more remarkable?
</P>
<P>
   That at age 52 Krzyzewski has assembled an extravagantly
talented Duke team and has led it to a 34-1 record and 29
consecutive victories as it heads into the East Regional semifinal
Friday night at the Meadowlands? Or that earlier this month, before
the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament, he left practice early to
see his daughter Jamie play in the opening round of the state high
school basketball tournament?
</P>
<P>
   In the Krzyzewski household, they will tell you it's the latter.
This season's Blue Devils would not be the dominant team they are
if their coach had not been banished from Cameron Indoor Stadium
for the 1994-95 season and forced to examine the foundation,
tearing down parts that had lifted him in the college coaching
record books alongside legends like John Wooden of UCLA and Dean
Smith of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski, the son of a Chicago elevator operator and an office
building cleaning lady, had to learn that hard work needs to be
paced. As a West Point graduate and former Army captain, he needed
to understand that some missions were best led by his lieutenants.
Most important, said his wife, he needed to realize that the
``rules of humanness apply'' to everyone no matter how many
consecutive Final Four appearances _ five from 1988-92 _ you make.
</P>
<P>
   Mickie Krzyzewski had tried to get her husband's attention in
1993. His colleague and friend, Jim Valvano, was dying of cancer
and in a magazine article confessed how coaching had eclipsed his
life and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy is telling your story, Mike,'' Mickie told him as she
handed him the article with Valvano's regrets highlighted.
</P>
<P>
   But the coachaholic had not hit bottom. He did, however, in the
most helpless way during the second half of the 1994-95 season.
While convalescing in seclusion at home on orders from his doctors
and Duke University officials, Krzyzewski watched as the Blue Devil
team he had led to a 9-3 start finished 13-18. Duke missed the NCAA
tournament for the first time since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to work, Krzyzewski struggled to adapt. His
mother, Emily, whom he called win or lose after every game, was
dying of cancer. The Krzyzewski's hired a time manager who helped
them put in a more efficient phone and computer system, pare and
organize his news media and personal appearances and even put up a
wall in the basketball office to isolate the coach from passers-by
and unscheduled intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   In the assistants Quin Snyder, Johnny Dawkins and David
Henderson _ each a player on his past Blue Devil teams _ Krzyzewski
had the staff to keep recruiting the championship-caliber talent
Duke had had trouble getting.
</P>
<P>
   No one could help him re-ground his family, however. Over the
years, Mickie and his daughters _ Debbie, 28, Lindy, 21, and Jamie,
17 _ became the Blue Devils who never graduated. They ate meals
with his teams, traveled to road games with them and boisterously
rode the officials from behind the Duke bench.
</P>
<P>
   But Krzyzewski brought them even closer after a conversation he
had with Valvano before the former North Carolina State coach's
death. Now, Krzyzewski made an effort to be part of their lives. He
made sure he was home from the office in time for family dinners.
He worked in the garden with them.
</P>
<P>
   When Emily Krzyzewski died in October 1996, Krzyzewski
experienced a tremendous loss, but also had the support to help
absorb it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still not over it,'' Mickie said. ``But in the course of
all that has gone on we're stronger now than ever as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   As the coach regained his center, so did his teams. Krzyzewski
went 18-13 on his return, followed by a 24-9 season, and a regional
final appearance with last year's 32-4 team.
</P>
<P>
   With his staff, Krzyzewski decided to recommit to an old
strategy. The staff would target ``our kind of kids,'' and not only
work them in the recruiting process but work even harder on getting
to know them after they signed, through letters and phone calls. He
had got away from that as he raced the treadmill to stay on top.
</P>
<P>
   From Dawkins to Christian Laettner to Grant Hill to Elton Brand,
Krzyzewski said that Duke players are linked by more than talent.
``They come from homes where getting an education is important,
where the parents or parent have taught them to respect
authority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski never lost his magic for bringing his kind of players
to Duke. He knows when to challenge them. The sophomore point guard
William Avery visited Durham as a high school junior with graduate
level basketball skills and mediocre grades. Krzyzewski told him he
would never get into Duke. Avery walked out, told his mother he was
going to be a Blue Devil and enrolled in Virginia's Oak Hill
Academy for his senior year to work on his grades.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Krzyzewski turned a matchup with Kentucky into a
death match more suited to late March when, just eight minutes into
the game, Shane Battier took a hard foul from a Wildcat player. It
was a clean play, but Krzyzewski was upset with how passively his
team accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let them do that to you,'' he said, sternly admonishing
the players from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Then the coach hounded his players to be physically punishing on
their way to a bare-knuckled 71-60 victory.
</P>
<P>
   In February, when the Blue Devils trailed Georgia Tech by 7
points nearing halftime of a sloppy game, Krzyzewski called time,
approached them in the huddle, then sullenly sat down without
saying a word.
</P>
<P>
   They got the message and came back to win. But on the bus after
the game, Krzyzewski sat among his players and told them how poor
his mother had been; how she worked hard but had no money and owned
just two dresses her entire life. But she was happy, Krzyzewski
told them, because she was a part of something bigger: a family.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the season, Krzyzewski told his team that
together they could do something special. On the bus that night, he
was telling them how.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always had this passion and emotion for the game,''
Dawkins, who was a player on his first Final Four team in 1986,
said. ``He has kept it at a high level, but to do that he had to
let us help him do more.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff lays the groundwork for recruiting and runs portions
of the practices. Often it is Snyder or Dawkins or Henderson who

 &HT;    House wanted Audie, and they got him
 &HT;    By staff reports

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Rep. Jerry Madden (R-Richardson) on Thursday
rallied the troops behind the most famous World War II soldier of
them all, Texan Audie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Madden and the dozens of other House members who wore
``WE WANT AUDIE!'' pins during Thursday's session wanted a portrait
of Murphy, the most decorated soldier of World War II, re-hung in
the House chamber. Members returned this January to find that the
portrait had been replaced by one of Gen. Ernest Othmer Thompson,
commander of the Texas National Guard, member of the Railroad
Commission and onetime mayor of Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was ``the common Texan who rose to historic proportions,
just like at the Alamo, so we think his proper place is here,''
Madden said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Crawford, executive director of the State Preservation
Board, said Murphy's portrait was removed about six months ago so
it could be part of an exhibit at the Capitol Visitors' Center
honoring Texas winners of the Medal of Honor. Most of the artifacts
displayed there were removed at the end of February, but as of
Thursday morning, Audie was still absent from the House chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said Madden called him Thursday morning to let him know
that he was launching his Audie campaign that day _ and by Thursday
afternoon, Audie was back. Crawford said the Preservation board
planned to return the Murphy portrait all along .
</P>
<P>
   `` It makes us look like we're pretty responsive, though,''
Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   OPEN RECORDS LAW REVISED
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a bill Thursday that would require the
attorney general to render opinions on open records law requests
within 45 days and cut down the length of an extension.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, by state Sen. John Carona (R-Dallas), also would
prohibit a state agency from asking the attorney general to
reconsider an open records opinion against it.
</P>
<P>
   Current law now allows the attorney general to issue an opinion
within 60 days and provides the possibility of 20 additional days,
if the attorney general notifies the agency and the person who
seeks the information.
</P>
<P>
   EMERGENCY SPENDING BILL SIGNED
</P>
<P>
   A $110 million emergency spending bill for items ranging from
boll weevil eradication to child protective services won Gov.
George W. Bush's approval on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With his signature, Bush turned into law a bill that would
include funding for teacher training for improved reading skills;
assistance to cotton farmers hard hit by drought; and funding for
disaster relief including flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The bill by Sen. Bill Ratliff (R-Mount Pleasant) has a price tag
that includes $103 million in state general revenue funding.
</P>
<P>
   It is effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   BORDER IMPROVEMENTS APPROVED
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Senate unanimously adopted legislation on Thursday to
help improve border conditions.
</P>
<P>
   University research into environmental issues affecting the
Texas-Mexico border region would be encouraged through the
state-funded Advanced Research Program, under one bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The well-being of Texas communities on the Rio Grande is tied
to their sister cities in Mexico,'' said Sen. Carlos Truan
(D-Corpus Christi), bill author. ``Their problems become our
problems.

DEBRIS STRIKES 3 AS GUSTS HIT TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fierce winds Thursday peeled a mammoth vinyl
advertisement off the Times Square building famous for the New
Year's Eve ball drop, injuring three women with falling debris and
prompting police to close a wide swath of midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The wind, which gusted to 40 mph, made the tattered remnants of
the billboard difficult to secure. Officials, concerned that more
debris would dislodge from the building, closed the surrounding
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was metal debris flying all over the place,'' said
Police Officer James Gampel, one of the first at the scene, who
tried to warn people. ``Some people were scattering.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep traffic out of the area, police closed Broadway and
Seventh Avenue from 57th to 41st Streets. Crosstown traffic was
barred from 41st to 43rd Streets between Avenue of the Americas and
Eighth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrians were kept off the same crosstown streets, although
they were allowed on parts of 41st and 43rd Streets. The streets
were reopened at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The flapping billboard, for Nokia mobile telephones, snapped off
pieces of lighting fixtures that illuminate the advertisements at
night, police said. The women who were injured had been walking on
the south side of the building at 1 Times Square around 1:15 p.m.;
all three were hit by the same 12-foot aluminum rod.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Ross, a police traffic agent, lay on the ground bleeding
after being struck on her shoulder and back. Police said the other
women hurt were Jane Hughes, 49, of Danielsville, Pa., who received
12 stitches for a gash on the side of her head, and Connie Farr,
51, of Calverton, N.Y., who was cut on the hand.
</P>
<P>
   Both worked in midtown and were on their way to lunch. After
they were knocked down, police officers carried them to a nearby
subway entrance to protect them from other projectiles. All three
were treated at Bellevue Hospital Center and were not expected to
stay overnight, said Pam McDonnell, the hospital spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in eight months that a building mishap at
the ill-starred intersection forced a massive closing to traffic
and pedestrians. Parts of 43rd Street and the surrounding area were
closed for up to four weeks last summer after a woman in the
Woodstock Hotel was killed by scaffolding that collapsed across the
street at 4 Times Square, the Conde Nast building.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, metal chunks kept tumbling past the famous news
zipper at 1 Times Square and clattering down into the street.
Police officers at the scene said one piece shattered the back
window of a patrol car and another falling metal pole pierced the
roof of an unoccupied Coca-Cola van.
</P>
<P>
   The van remained parked at the scene, a powerful visual aid to
police as they diverted pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Coca-Cola van behind me with the projectile in
it,'' one officer bellowed to gathered pedestrians through a
bullhorn. ``That's not a normal situation.''
</P>
<P>
   To get to the remnants of the huge vinyl sheet still flapping in
the wind and the loosened lighting fixtures high up on the
building, about 10 firefighters from the Fire Department's rescue
unit scaled down its sides from the roof.
</P>
<P>
   They were secured by body harnesses as they inched down the side
of the building, gathering in the heavy-duty plastic. The brackets
holding it had also loosened and had to be brought down.
</P>
<P>
   Subway service was not affected although some entrances and
exits could not be used. Police said that no theater performances
were canceled although some ticketholders had to make long detours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thankful that what could have been a terrible tragedy
has been somewhat contained,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who
visited the injured women at Bellevue and went to the scene. ``Now
it's going to take a while to fix it up and to figure out why that
particular advertisement came loose.''
</P>
<P>
   The building, a skinny, 22-story tower built in 1904, originally
to house The New York Times, is virtually empty except for the
Warner Brothers Studio Store that occupies the first three floors.
But it is known as an advertising gold mine because it features so
prominently in the intersection sometimes called ``the crossroads
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jamestown group, a German investment firm, bought the
building in 1997 from Lehman Brothers for about $110 million, a sum
that reflected the massive redevelopment in the area.

VERDICT BACKS CIGARETTE MAKERS IN SUIT BY UNION HEALTH PLANS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Minn., Miss., Ohio, Texas)  (rk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a major legal victory for tobacco companies, a federal jury
in Akron, Ohio, ruled Thursday that the companies did not have to
repay dozens of union health and benefit plans in that state the
costs of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit by the union health plans, which was patterned after
recent tobacco cases brought by state attorneys general, was the
first of its kind to reach trial. As a result, it was viewed by
industry analysts as a watershed. A verdict in favor of the union
plans, which were seeking up to $2 billion in damages, could have
created financial turmoil for some cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   In the class-action lawsuit, more than 100 union health plans in
Ohio representing a variety of building trades said cigarette
makers had conspired to hide evidence of smoking dangers and, as a
result, should have to reimburse the plans for health care costs.
The jury deliberated over three days before returning a verdict in
favor of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with this jury's verdict,'' said a statement
released Thursday by the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., a
subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC. ``The trial demonstrated that
when the tobacco companies have an opportunity to present the facts
in response to speculative allegations about their conduct, the
allegations collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The other defendants in the case included Philip Morris Cos.,
the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co., a subsidiary of the RJR Nabisco
Holdings Corp. and the Lorillard Tobacco Co., a subsidiary of the
Loews Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Coughlin, the union funds' chief lawyer, told The
Associated Press he was disappointed in the jury's assessment of
the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to understand how somebody could look at all that
activity and then say that's all right or that didn't impact
millions and millions of people,'' Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, tobacco company stocks rose, with a share of
Philip Morris stock gaining $3.75 to close at $42. A share of RJR
Nabisco gained $1.6875 to close at $30.3135.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict represented yet another tilt in the unsettled legal
seesaw affecting the tobacco industry. Last month, a state jury in
San Francisco granted the biggest tobacco award in history when it
ordered Philip Morris to pay $51.5 million to a woman who said her
inoperable lung cancer had been caused by more than 35 years of
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The recent $206 billion settlement between tobacco companies and
46 states did not cover ongoing or future lawsuits brought by
individual smokers or groups like the health insurance plans.
Before that accord, the industry had reached settlements worth some
$40 billion over 25 years with four other states, Florida,
Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The state lawsuits were filed to seek reimbursement of Medicaid
money spent treating smoking-related illnesses. The union lawsuits,
which have been filed in several states, have tried to follow that
model by asserting that the producers are liable for reimbursing
similar health-fund costs.

   U.S. TRADE DEFICIT SOARS TO ALMOST $17 BILLION
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade deficit jumped to a new monthly record of nearly
$17 billion in January, fueled by a flood of imports from China
that could stir further protectionist sentiments in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Among the imports pouring into the nation was Chinese-made
steel, which increased 65 percent from December. The House passed a
bill Wednesday that would sharply limit steel imports, ignoring
opposition from the Republican leadership and a White House warning
that the measure would violate world trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The House's vote to limit steel imports reflects a sense of
frustration within the domestic steel industry over the low-priced
steel that landed on U.S. shores during the economic crises in Asia
and Russia last year.

in fiscal 1998 and the first half of fiscal 1999 slumped. LVMH
chairman Bernard Arnault attributed the bad results to losses at
the DFS Group, a duty-free operator acquired in 1997 that lost $37

WITH EARNINGS UP, GUCCI SAYS IT DOESN'T NEED HELP FROM A SLUMPING
LVMH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Gucci Group NV reported an 11 percent increase in fiscal
1999 earnings Thursday and said the strong results showed that the
Italian fashion house needs no help from LVMH, the French luxury
goods maker that is trying to take it over.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were released hastily on the day LVMH said its own
earnings in fiscal year 1998 and the first half of fiscal year 1999
slumped, dragged down by the economic crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings results of both companies were disclosed on the eve
of meetings in the Netherlands, where Gucci is incorporated, with
executives of LVMH, to try to negotiate a compromise solution to
their wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH had been amassing Gucci shares and is now its biggest
stockholder, with a 34.4 percent stake. It had been pressing for
board representation in what Gucci had called part of a hostile
attempt to acquire the company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pushed Gucci's share price up as much as 9 percent
after it reported profits for the year ended Jan. 31 of $3.28 a
share, compared with $2.86 a share in fiscal year 1998.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, LVMH said that earnings in the last half of 1998
dropped 48 percent, as shrinking numbers of Japanese tourists cut
into sales. Roughly 70 percent of LVMH's revenues depend on Asian
sales or on Asian tourists who purchase LVMH products like Louis
Vuitton bags and Givenchy perfumes on European tours or at
airports. But LVMH said it expects profits to improve 15 percent
this year, as the Asian slump in demand for luxury products with
European names bottoms out. That news helped strengthen LVMH's
share price by as much as 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci's brawl with LVMH intensified last month when the Italian
fashion house strengthened its resistance to an unwanted takeover
by issuing shares to an employee pension fund that diluted LVMH's
share to 25 percent. LVMH sued in an Amsterdam court to block
Gucci's plan, but the court suspended the voting rights of both
LVMH and the Gucci fund pending a ruling in April. In the meantime,
both companies are sending executives to the talks Friday to try to
reach an out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Domenico De Sole, Gucci's chief executive, fired a parting shot
before the talks, inviting investors and analysts to ``compare our
excellent results with the 1998 results that LVMH published
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gucci's results, he said in a statement, ``underline our success
in managing the company in the difficult economic environment that
prevailed in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Gucci will provide details of full year results on Monday. But
an increase in revenue to $1.04 billion, from $975 million the year
before, appeared to demonstrate Gucci's success in shifting from a
reliance on Asian tourists to young European and American
consumers. De Sole predicted that sales and earnings would continue
to rise this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Arnault, LVMH's chairman, showed his feisty side, saying
there was ``no question of today launching a takeover bid'' for
Gucci, which he described as ``risky.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Paris, Arnault attributed LVMH's overall
bad results to losses at the DFS Group Ltd., a duty-free operator
acquired in 1997 that lost $37 million in 1998. Without those
losses, he said, LVMH earnings would have risen 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis, he said was ``past the turning point.''

NYC DROPS PUSH TO RESTRICT LAND NEAR RESERVOIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After repeated efforts to persuade the federal
government to strictly limit building on marshes around New York
City's upstate reservoirs, the Giuliani administration reversed
itself this week, saying the wetlands needed no special
protections.
</P>
<P>
   The city's new position echoes the views of Republican officials
from rural communities around the reservoirs and pits city
officials against private environmental groups and the federal
Environmental Protection Agency, which say that special
restrictions are needed because wetlands help to purify the city's
water.
</P>
<P>
   The change was outlined in a March 15 letter from Environmental
Protection Commissioner Joel Miele to the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, which is updating federal rules for wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups and Democratic city officials assailed
the move and accused Giuliani of putting his possible race for the
Senate, and his need for Republican support outside the city, ahead
of his responsibility to protect the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, denied there was
any political motive behind the change. One of Miele's deputies
made the original recommendations, and Miele never approved them,
Lhota said.
</P>
<P>
   Lhota defended the city's new stance, saying the city's water
supply was already sufficiently protected from pollution. ``Anyone
who makes the argument that these new rules would protect the
watershed any further, that's just false and cheap politics,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The city reversed its stance on the new restrictions after the
original recommendations angered Republican state legislators and
county officials, who called Giuliani and Miele to complain that
tighter rules would stifle development.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Without a strong recommendation by the city for special rules
around the reservoirs, several environmental lawyers said, the
stricter standard are less likely to be adopted by the Army Corps
of Engineers, particularly because upstate communities have sent
the agency extensive comments of their own, opposing such a move.
The agency is responsible for issuing permits for filling in small
tracts of wetlands and thus can limit development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extreme and radical action to withdraw recommendations
like this,'' said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer for Riverkeeper,
an environmental group that strongly supported the Giuliani
administration two years ago when it committed to an ambitious plan
to protect the water supply. ``We're worried that water quality is
being traded for political advantage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, the corps has been updating its nationwide
system for issuing permits to fill wetlands, seeking to identify
areas where wetlands are particularly vulnerable or important and
need protection.
</P>
<P>
   The city's original written comments, by Dr. William Stasiuk, a
deputy commissioner of the city Department of Environmental
Protection in charge of the water supply, recommended that the
strictest procedures be applied to proposals for developing the
2,000 square miles that drain into the reservoirs, with individual
applications required for any filling or construction affecting
more than one-third of an acre of wetlands. The general standard
used by the Federal agency requires an application and review only
for any project filling more than three acres of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Stasiuk said extra protection was needed because ``further loss
or degradation of the remaining wetlands in the watersheds may
jeopardize regional water quality.''
</P>
<P>
   But when his comments were circulated in upstate communities
last month, local officials called them a ``sneak attack'' on the
rights of residents around the reservoirs to develop their
property. Stasiuk declined to comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, several city officials sent Giuliani letters
criticizing the retraction of Stasiuk's original wetlands
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   In their letters, they said the city's reversal increased the
chances that the water supply would slowly be degraded, eventually
forcing the city to build a $6 billion filtration plant to remove
pollution that could have been prevented.

<P>
   The EPA has no say in the final decision on wetlands rules by
the corps, but has indicated that the wetlands around the
reservoirs deserve special protection.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Miele defended the change in the
city's position, saying there was no need to saddle communities in
the watershed with extra federal restrictions because his staff
already had the right to stop any action that might pollute the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Miele acknowledged that the city's options were
somewhat limited. Two years ago, it signed an agreement with
communities around the reservoirs that ended their longstanding
legal challenges to the city's pollution regulations around the
watersheds. In return, the city began spending hundreds of millions
of dollars to help the communities keep the water clean, and it
acknowledged their right to continue to grow economically.

 Getting Ch'i to Flow Smoothly
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
(Editor's note: At the request of The Chronicle, Deborah Gee
offered to go through a feng shui consultation with a downtown San
Francisco travel agency. Her assignment: two merged companies, one
office, 26 travel agents who started working together for the first
time this week.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Deborah Gee started her survey, which was offered free of charge,
of the S.R. Travel Agency in the same place she starts all her
corporate feng shui work _ at the front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though you may not physically have clients walking
through the door because you do business electronically, the front
door is still symbolic,'' Gee explained to the agency's general
manager, Barbara Peterson. ``The reception area's color and design
determine how ch'i (energy) will flow through the rest of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui is the ancient Chinese art of placing buildings and
furniture in a way designed to ensure the smooth flow of ch'i, or
life energy.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called ``acupuncture for buildings,'' feng shui also
uses accessories like mirrors, plants and fountains to redirect the
flow of ch'i.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  It's becoming more common in American workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   And it would be hard to find a more typical workplace than S.R.
Travel's 10th-floor office: Lots of cubicles and computers. White
or gray walls with scattered travel posters. A fortresslike
reception desk near the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Gee zeroed in right away on a corner of the reception desk that
jutted toward the front door.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that, according to feng shui, sharp angles on
furniture or buildings can shoot sharp negative ch'i at the people
in their path.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an angle here; I can feel it because of my
training,'' Gee said. ``What I recommend is a plant here, something
that will hang and soften the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee then moved on into Peterson's pentagonal private office. Her
advice:
</P>
<P>
   _Move the desk away from its current spot directly in front of
the door. ``When you are in the direct path of the door, the ch'i
comes right at you and distracts you,'' Gee said.
</P>
<P>
   _But keep the desk facing generally toward the door. ``If your
back is to the ch'i as it comes in the door, you won't benefit from
it,'' she said. ``Having your back to the door also symbolizes
turning your back on opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   _Buy a potted plant for one corner with ``stagnant'' ch'i.
``Stagnant energy is going to slow down your thought processes,''
Gee said. ``I'd suggest a tall floor plant that will keep the
energy flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   _Hang award plaques on one particular wall _ the side of the
room that feng shui links to the achievement of fame or good
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   _Install a small decorative fountain in front of the fifth wall
of the office, which is slanted. ``Because you have a slanted wall
in the `career' area of the room, it will minimize the flow of ch'i
into your career,'' Gee warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``But don't worry _ we're going to fix that!'' she added with a
laugh. ``Because the career area is also associated with the
element of water, you should add one of those wonderful-sounding
water fountains. It will complement and neutralize the slanting
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Gee moved on to other parts of the office _ such as a big
room filled with cubicles for a dozen travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news: Almost all the agents were positioned so that their
backs were facing the entries to their cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   Gee's solution? Install mirrors on the cubicle walls in front of
each agent. ``Whatever you are doing workwise, a mirror will double
it symbolically so you get twice as much business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And hang tubular metal wind chimes or multifaceted crystal
globes from the ceiling over each agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there's no wind in here, the symbolism is that the
chime redirects the flow of ch'i,'' Gee said.
</P>
<P>
   The travel agents _ absorbed in their computers and phone
conversations with clients _ barely looked up as Gee passed by.
</P>
<P>
   But Peterson predicted her staff would respond positively to
most of Gee's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agents understand bad energy,'' she said. ``They come into
my office sometimes and say, `There's really bad energy out
there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson added that feng shui would be far more popular with
both employees and managers than another possible strategy for
solidifying the newly merged agency _ namely, taking everyone on a
ropes course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be less expensive to put up mirrors than to go to a
team-building retreat in Napa for two days, which is what we'd been
talking about,'' Peterson said.

ST. JOHN'S TURNS MARYLAND UPSIDE DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The bitter losses to Stanford and Duke and
Connecticut would prepare them, coach Mike Jarvis told his team in
offering solace only a few weeks agos. On Thursday night, those
defeats seemed like fond memories as St. John's delivered a
staggering 76-62 victory over second-seeded Maryland in the South
Regional semifinal of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The result embraced the sort of postseason success St. John's
could only have imagined just two weeks ago, when Connecticut
manhandled St. John's in the Big East Conference tournament final.
Now, St. John's, a team that was in nobody's preseason top 25, is
one victory _ against either Ohio State or Auburn _ from the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   For three-quarters of the game, St. John's did to Maryland what
no team _ not even top-ranked Duke _ had done this season: Take the
Terps out of the game and cause them to self-destruct. The first
half ended with a 20-point run by the Red Storm that was all you
needed to know about the game.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's had used Maryland's favorite poison to kill it: The
Red Storm turned the high-octane running offense the Terrapins
favor to ignite an extraordinary run that had former St. John's
coach Lou Carnesecca accepting congratulations at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland was playing not only to get to the Final Four, but also
to exorcise nearly 25 years worth of demons. The Terrapins have
been to the Round of 16 four times in the last six years, but have
got no closer to the Final Four since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Gary Williams alone was 0-3 in regional semifinals since
taking over at Maryland in 1989, a failing the volatile coach is
reminded of approximately as often as he screams at his players.
Previous Maryland teams failed for a variety of reasons _ last
year, for instance, the Terps lost to the defending national
champion, Arizona, and in 1980, as a second-seeded team, they lost
to third-seeded Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   But this season's version set records for victories in the
regular season (25) and in Atlantic Coast Conference play (13) and
a loss here was bound to haunt Maryland more than any of the
others.
</P>
<P>
   The ghosts must have been weighing heavily on Williams'
shoulders in the first half. St. John's played an extraordinary
first half, using man, zone, press and trap defenses to hold
Maryland _ averaging 85 points a game _ to 19 points. The Terrapins
did not score for the last 8 minutes 25 seconds of the half.
</P>
<P>
   That freed St. John's, with the unflappable point guard Erick
Barkley handling the vaunted Maryland press, to explode on a 20-0
run before intermission. The Red Storm went into the locker room
up, 38-19.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland had 13 turnovers and only seven field goals in the
first half. St. John's, shooting just 42.4 percent from the field,
had 10 assists on 14 field goals, and just five turnovers against
the pressure defense. So stunning was St. John's dominance that
Williams, who sweats so much that opposing fans in the ACC call for
him to toss his jacket, was rendered speechless. There was no rant
that could stop this run.
</P>
<P>
   There was no hint of Maryland's drought in the early going. St.
John's was trailing by 19-18 with 8:25 left in the half. The Red
Storm was slow to set up its halfcourt offense and struggled with
its perimeter shooting (1 of 7 on 3-pointers to that point), unable
to work the ball inside. But after a television timeout, the Red
Storm was untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   The run began with a thread-the-needle pass in traffic from Ron
Artest to Bootsy Thornton for a layup. On the next trip down,
Artest got one of his three first-half blocks on the Terps'
spectacular guard Steve Francis, and that led to another easy
Thornton layup.

Miami of Ohio's Charlie Coles still has heart for coaching 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ When Charlie Coles woke up, the doctors were there.
The prognosis was rather cheery, given that they had just saved his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said there was no serious damage to the heart,'' he
recalls, ``and it looked like if we treated it with medication, it
would be OK and I could keep on coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, oh man, that's all I wanted to hear. I never, ever asked
anyone for another opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Feb. 28, 1998, and Coles _ basketball coach at Miami of
Ohio _ had just suffered a heart attack on the court during a MAC
tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, it seemed as if Coles' life and coaching career _
two entities he admits have become fused over the past 34 years _
were over.
</P>
<P>
   It is a year later, and the RedHawks (24-7) are living the
largest moment in the school's basketball history. Tonight, they
will face Kentucky (27-8) in the Trans World Dome in the first
Sweet 16 game Miami has played.
</P>
<P>
   Coles, 57, is glad he didn't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give thanks every day, I honestly do,'' he says. ``I had
bypass surgery in '85, and that was scarier, because I actually
knew what was going on. This last deal was just kinda quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never asked anyone any more about it ... because if
they'd come to me and said, `Well, it's your choice _ you can go
back to coaching, but if you do ...'
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't know what I would have done. I love coaching,
but I love my family, too, and they love me. I just never wanted to
hear anyone put that choice on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, it has become quietly obvious that Coles is one
of the best coaches in America. The portfolio, of course, is a bit
thin by marquee standards.
</P>
<P>
   From 1986-91, he was the coach at Central Michigan, dispatching
Dan Majerle to the NBA, among other accomplishments. He has been
the coach at Miami for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The other years were spent as an assistant, or, more often, a
high school coach _ including three years at Toledo Central
Catholic High in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   He is full of praise for successful Division I-A coaches such as
Tubby Smith, Roy Williams, and Rick Majerus. But there is no envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just always wanted to be a coach,'' he says, ``and the level
I coached at never mattered much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't interviewed for that many jobs. If I can
coach, I can be happy, and I was just as happy at Toledo Central as
anywhere else. A coach is a coach is a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this is his third trip to the NCAA Tournament, he has
mostly built a collection of lifelong friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I ever saw him,'' says Michigan State coach Tom
Izzo, ``I was a senior in high school, and had gone down to the
state tournament. I watched him drag a player off the court because
he was upset at the way the kid was acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those who played for him have always loved and respected
him. Anything good that happens to Miami in this tournament, they
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles says the good has already happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've coached 34 years and been married to a wonderful wife
\RDelores\S for 35, and I have two great kids,'' he says. ``I feel
that I have been fulfilled in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my goal to coach all of my life ... and I guess I've
just about done it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I try to watch myself now. Whenever I get upset and start
yelling on the court, the kids just think, `Coach is hollering;
he's OK.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But later, I'll get down on my knees and say, `Lord, you know
I didn't really mean that, don't you?'''

IS VIZCAINO IN THE CARDS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ If Joe McEwing and Pat Kelly don't work out
at second base for the St. Louis Cardinals, Jose Vizcaino of the
Dodgers could be their next option.
</P>
<P>
   A day after releasing Carlos Baerga, Cardinals general manager
Walt Jocketty said he may go outside the organization to find a
capable defensive second baseman if his current charges fail.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said no serious talks were
ongoing regarding a possible Vizcaino trade, but sources said the
Cardinals are ``intrigued'' with Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at guys in the organization and we're also
looking outside the organization,'' Jocketty said. ``We're more
concerned with defense up the middle. We think we can generate
enough offense between guys like J.D. Drew and Mark McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino, a career .272 hitter with 20 homers in 10 seasons, is
known for his defense. The Dodgers are after prospects, and the
Cardinals have spoken in the past about making pitchers Jose
Jimenez and Manny Aybar available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to a lot of GMs about a lot of things,'' Malone
said. ``(The Cardinals) are looking to shore up their
middle-infield position, but I talk with a couple of GMs a day.
Everyone is trying to figure out where they're at and what they're
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki achin': Right-hander Dave Mlicki's scheduled appearance
today was pushed back to Sunday because of stiffness in the lateral
muscle near his right shoulder blade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little stiff so he didn't throw his bullpen this time,
and I don't want to send a guy out there who hasn't thrown a
bullpen,'' pitching coach Charlie Hough said. ``He's a hard
thrower, and they usually go through some discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Hough and Mlicki both said the stiffness came out of his last
outing. He threw 42/3 innings against Cleveland on March 13, and
didn't get a chance to warm up fully because starter Ismael Valdes
left the game with a tight thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably could pitch, but we might as well go a few more
days and wait,'' Mlicki said. ``It's happened to me before. This is
the fourth straight year it's happened, so it's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is certainly something other clubs will keep an eye on
since Mlicki, the sixth starter in a five-man rotation, is
considered to be on the trading block.
</P>
<P>
   Avila retires: Ralph Avila, a staple of the Dodgers organization
for the past 29 years, announced Thursday he was semi-retiring from
his position of vice president of Campo Las Palmas in the Dominican
Republic and as the Latin America scouting coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Major-leaguers Pedro Martinez, Ramon Martinez, Pedro Astacio,
Jose Offerman, Raul Mondesi, Vizcaino and Wilton Guerrero each
passed through Campo Las Palmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of the players, but I'm more proud that the
staff I recruited there, I'm pretty sure they are second to
nobody,'' Avila said. ``I got an opportunity to work with Mike
Piazza. When I got him he was a first baseman and converted him to
a catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Avila, 68, will continue to serve as a special adviser to the
president, a consulting position with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley watch: Manager Davey Johnson said he's hoping catcher
Todd Hundley can catch after the Dodgers off day Tuesday. Hundley,
trying to return from reconstructive right elbow surgery, hasn't
caught a game this spring. He was supposed to catch last Sunday but
experienced soreness in a muscle in his right elbow, something the
Dodgers said is related to taking more than 30 minutes worth of
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dodgers brass said not to worry, something club
physician Dr. Frank Jobe reiterated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he could catch now, but I know they want to take it
slowly,'' Jobe said. ``It's progressing, but slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   This, that and the other: Today marks the one-year anniversary
of Peter O'Malley's sale of the Dodgers to Rupert Murdoch and the
Fox Group. . . . Hough said Jeff Shaw will make his spring debut
today. . . . Pitcher Ricardo Jordan was reassigned to the
minor-league camp after giving up two runs in one inning. . . .
Outfielder Trenidad Hubbard, sidelined since a collision with Hiram
Bocachica on March 8, said he's still three or four days away from
returning to play. Originally, Hubbard was out with a thumb injury
but said his left shoulder is bothering him now. . . . Jacob
Brumfield, signed to a minor-league deal, has moved into the
major-league clubhouse and is contesting Hubbard for the fifth
outfielder's job. Brumfield is batting .353 with two homers in six
games.

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   DUKE VS. SW MISSOURI STATE
</P>
<P>
   When; where: 7:38 p.m. today; Continental Airlines Arena, East
Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   TV; radio: CBS; WQXI (790 AM).
</P>
<P>
   Records: Duke 34-1; SW Missouri State 22-10.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches: Mike Krzyzewski is 539-213 overall, 466-154 in his 19th
season at Duke; Steve Alford, 154-76 overall, 76-47 in his fourth
season at SW Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   How they got here: Duke, the No. 1 seed, won its first two NCAA
Tournament games by 41 points each, beating Florida A&AMP;M 99-58 and
Tulsa 97-56; SW Missouri State, the No. 12 seed, defeated Wisconsin
43-32 and Tennessee 81-51.
</P>
<P>
   Starting lineups: Duke _ guards, William Avery (6-2, so., 15.1
ppg) and Trajan Langdon (6-3, sr., 17.0 ppg); center, Elton Brand
(6-8, so., 17.8 ppg); forwards, Shane Battier (6-8, so., 9.6 ppg)
and Chris Carrawell (6-6, jr., 9.8 ppg); SW Missouri State _
guards, Kevin Ault (6-3, jr., 11.9 ppg) and William Fontleroy (6-3,
jr., 10.9 ppg); center, Danny Moore (6-10, sr., 16.5 ppg);
forwards, Ron Burton (6-6, jr., 5.4 ppg) and Ken Stringer (6-5,
jr., 5.8 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Southwest Missouri is in its first Sweet 16 thanks to
defense. The Bears held their first two NCAA opponents to 30-of-108
shooting from the floor, 27.7 percent. They also have an underrated
post player in Danny Moore, who has 37 points and 20 rebounds in
two tournament games. But none of that matters against a Duke team
that has won its last 11 games by an average of 30.8 points. The
Blue Devils have too much athleticism, and Trajan Langdon is back
after sitting out three games with an injured foot.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Duke 85-50.
</P>
<P>
   PURDUE VS. TEMPLE
</P>

   TV; radio: None in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Records: Temple 23-10; Purdue 21-12.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches: John Chaney is 604-218 overall, 379-159 in 17 years at
Temple; Gene Keady is 453-199 overall, 415-180 in 18 seasons at
Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   How they got here: Temple, the sixth seed, defeated Kent 64-51
in the first round and upset third-seeded Cincinnati 64-54 in the
second round; Purdue, the 10th seed, beat Texas 58-54 in overtime
in the first round and upset No. 2 seed Miami of Florida 73-63 in
the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Starting lineups: Temple _ guards, Pepe Sanchez (6-4, jr., 5.8
ppg) and Rasheed Brokenborough (6-4, sr., 11.7 ppg); center, Kevin
Lyde (6-9, fr., 7.4 ppg); forwards, Lamont Barnes (6-10, jr., 12.9
ppg) and Mark Karcher (6-5, so., 13.0 ppg); Purdue _ guards, Tony
Mayfield (6-1, sr., 2.6 ppg) and Alan Eldridge (6-1, sr., 6.8 ppg);
center, Greg McQuay (6-7, jr., 10.8 ppg); forwards, Brian Cardinal
(6-8, jr., 11.6 ppg) and Jaraan Cornell (6-3, jr., 15.2).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: A couple of giant killers play for a chance to meet
Duke. Purdue came into the tournament on a low note, having lost
five of its last six regular-season games. Keady finally has
settled on a starting lineup after using six different ones during
the season. It is Purdue's fourth trip to the Sweet 16 in the '90s,
but the Boilermakers have yet to reach the Final Four under Keady.
Temple drives teams crazy with a matchup zone defense that forces
teams to hit from the outside. In the tournament, that defense has
been especially effective, as Kent and Cincinnati hit only 14 of 45
3-pointers, 31.1 percent. If Purdue misses early and gets
impatient, the Boilermakers could be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Temple 57-47.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The judge who scored Saturday night's heavyweight
unification bout in Evander Holyfield's favor sat in a witness
chair Thursday and watched a videotape of the fight's fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   Eugenia Williams scored the round for Holyfield despite Lennox
Lewis' decisive edge in punches landed. Of the other two judges,
one voted for Lewis and the other called it a draw, and the fight
resulted in a draw. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the videotape of TVKO's pay-per-view telecast showed
Williams something different. ``From what I saw, I'd have to say
Lewis was the winner,'' she testified before a hearing of the New
York Senate Committee on Investigations, Taxation and Government
Operations. ``Based on the punches I saw connecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she defended her scoring of the round. ``What I saw is
not what the camera saw,'' Williams said, her lawyer beside her.
``They're at a different angle than I saw. I only scored the blows
I saw. I can only score what I could see.''
</P>
<P>
   With multiple angles and close-ups, television can present an
unobstructed view of the fight, while judges have a single view,
looking up from ringside.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw live is different from what I saw on TV,'' Williams
added.
</P>
<P>
   The committee convened the hearing as the outcry increased
following the draw in the fight at Madison Square Garden. The
Manhattan district attorney has launched a criminal inquiry, and
the state attorney general is conducting an investigation of the
sport. Sen. Roy M. Goodman, R-Manhattan., the committee chairman,
said there was a need to ``dissect the events of the
Holyfield-Lewis fight to determine if a malignancy existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite testimony that many of boxing's practices required
reform _ such as promoters paying fight judges, and sanctioning
bodies choosing the judges and rating fighters in ways that do not
adequately reward their records _ the hearing's main revelation was
that Williams had a lousy judging perch.
</P>
<P>
   On numerous occasions, she said, she pushed photographers out of
her way. She tried to get a better vantage point by sitting on a
table, but it was uncomfortable. During Round five, she said, her
view was blocked by Lewis' back, keeping her from tallying punches
apparently seen by the other judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did notice that she had the worst seat of the lot,'' said
Larry O'Connell, the judge who scored the fight a draw but was
quoted in a London newspaper as saying he had erred. ``She was
surrounded by photographers.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said his position and that of the third judge, Stanley
Christodoulou of South Africa, who scored the bout for Lewis, was
unimpeded.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   How the judges were selected interested the committee because
the titles of the IBF, the WBC and the W BA were at stake. Each
organization chose a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Sulaiman, the WBC president, testified by phone that his
intention was that all three judges should be from neutral
countries and would not favor Holyfield, an American, or Lewis, an
Englishman. But after the IBF chose Williams, an American, Sulaiman
switched to O'Connell, an Englishman, from Daniel van de Wiele, a
Belgian.
</P>
<P>
   Williams ``was not a good choice,'' Sulaiman said. ``We needed
an experienced judge from a neutral country.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the other judges, Williams' $5,150 fee, travel and lodging,
at the Pennsylvania Hotel in Manhattan, were paid by Don King, the
promoter, through sanctioning fees paid to the State Athletic
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said she was not offered special favors or money to
influence her scoring. ``It was strictly objective,'' she said. She
also said she had not been persuaded with financial help because of
her recent filing for personal bankruptcy. ``Absolutely not,'' said
Williams, who is an accountant for the municipal government of
Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman tried to find a personal link between Williams and
Robert W. Lee, the president of the IBF, that might have affected
her judging. (Holyfield holds the IBF and WBA heavyweight titles.)
But Williams said Lee was no more than a mentor who helped her
understand the fine points of judging.
</P>
<P>
   Lee canceled his testimony on the advice of his lawyer. The IBF
is the subject of a continuing federal investigation into
allegations that it sold rankings and arranged fights in return for
kickbacks, The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., reported this week.

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   MICHIGAN STATE VS. OKLAHOMA
</P>
<P>
   When; where: 7:55 p.m. today; Trans World Dome, St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Records: Michigan State 31-4; Oklahoma 22-10.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches: Tom Izzo is 86-40 in four seasons at Michigan State;
Kelvin Sampson is 103-54 in five seasons at Oklahoma, 279-202
overall.
</P>
<P>
   How they got here: No. 1 seed Michigan State won according to
form, defeating Mount St. Mary's 76-53 in the first round and
Mississippi 74-66 in the second. Surprising 13th-seeded Oklahoma
first knocked off Arizona 61-60 and then North Carolina-Charlotte
85-72.
</P>
<P>
   Probable lineups: Michigan State _ guards, Mateen Cleaves (6-2,
jr., 11.8 ppg) and Jason Klein (6-7, sr., 9.9 ppg); center, Antonio
Smith (6-8, jr., 6.8 ppg); forwards, A.J. Granger (6-9, jr., 6.3
ppg) and Andre Hutson (6-8, so., 8.5 ppg). Oklahoma _ guards,
Michael Johnson (6-0, sr., 11.6 ppg), Alex Spaulding (6-3, so., 3.9
ppg) and Eric Martin (6-5, sr., 12.4 ppg); forwards, Eduardo Najera
(6-8, jr., 15.7 ppg) and Ryan Humphrey (6-8, jr., 11.1 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: History looks unkindly upon the Sooners, only the third
No. 13 seed to make the Sweet 16; neither of the other two _
Valparaiso or Richmond _ advanced. They have a shooter's chance of
an upset, having connected on 23 3-pointers in their two tournament
victories. They took Arizona's Jason Terry out of the game in the
first round; he shot only 4-of-17. Now comes the challenge of
Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves. Cleaves, though, is unselfish
enough to create opportunities for others. While not flashy, the
Spartans work the boards hard, with an 8.6 rebounding margin this
season. Their depth is too much, with an all-Big 10 player, Morris
Peterson, coming off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Michigan State, 75-63.
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY VS. MIAMI
</P>
<P>
   When; where: 10:15 p.m. today; Trans World Dome, St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   TV: CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Records: Kentucky 27-8, Miami of Ohio 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches: Tubby Smith is 62-12 in two seasons at Kentucky, 186-74
overall; Charlie Coles is 62-28 in three seasons at Miami, 154-113
overall.
</P>
<P>
   How they got here: Kentucky, the No. 3 seed, opened with an
82-60 win over New Mexico State, then outlasted Kansas in overtime
92-88. No. 10 seed Miami of Ohio upset No. 7 Washington 59-58 and
No. 2 Utah 66-58.
</P>
<P>
   Probable lineups: Kentucky _ guards, Wayne Turner (6-2, sr.,
10.7 ppg) and Desmond Allison (6-5, fr., 4.7 ppg); center, Michael
Bradley (6-10, so., 10.3 ppg); forwards, Heshimu Evans (6-6, sr.,
11.8 ppg) and Scott Padgett (6-9, sr., 12.5 ppg). Miami of Ohio _
guards, Rob Mestas (5-10, jr., 7.1 ppg), Damon Frierson (6-4, sr.,
13.1 ppg) and Anthony Taylor (6-1, jr., 3.8 ppg); forwards, Wally
Szczerbiak (6-8, sr., 24.3 ppg) and John Estick (6-6, sr., 8.5
ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Does Wally have an encore left in him? Szczerbiak
carried the RedHawks in the first round with a 43-point, 12-rebound
tour de force. Against Utah, he passed off and still got 24 points
and seven rebounds. Kentucky scrambles a defense capable of
shutting down one such pivotal player. While Miami makes its first
trip to the Sweet 16, the senior-driven Wildcats still don't know
what it feels like to lose in the postseason under Smith. It also
appears Kentucky has regained its shooting eye; after finishing
last in the SEC in 3-point shooting; the 'Cats have hit 19 of 38
3-point attempts in two NCAA Tournament games. Confidence and
experience are powerful allies.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Kentucky, 85-65.

columnist for the St. Petersburg Times in St. Petersburg, Fla. He

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When I was a child in Florida's public schools during the 1950s
and 1960s, I admired my teachers. Along with being benign
tormentors, my teachers were role models, neighbors, surrogate
parents, friends. After becoming a college writing teacher in the
early 1970s, I proudly encouraged many of my students to become
schoolteachers.
 &HT;    More than a few took my advice.
 &HT;    Today, however, I would be hard pressed to advise a student to
become a member of what used to be called ``the noblest
profession.'' Yes, teaching still carries many intrinsic rewards,
such as the satisfaction of watching inquisitive minds grow
intellectually or helping youngsters who lack self-esteem gain the
courage to voice their opinions in class.
 &HT;    In far too many ways, though, teaching has become an ignoble
profession in America. Here in Florida, public education per se is
under siege on several fronts, and our GOP-controlled legislature
and our new Republican governor, Jeb Bush, are treating teachers as
if they were enemies of the people.
 &HT;    In addition to ramming through vouchers (using tax dollars for
private school tuition), many politicians are spewing punitive
rhetoric that, among other things, casts teachers as slackers
responsible for the sorry conditions in many school districts.
 &HT;    The governor, too, refuses to face the hard truth about what
needs to be done to improve public education: Put teachers first.
Every reliable study on the subject shows that teacher competence
is the most important pedagogical factor in the classroom. Without
good teaching, effective learning is virtually impossible for most
students.
 &HT;    Bush _ and lawmakers nationwide _ should stop the
sleight-of-hand approach to education immediately and pass
legislation that sets teacher salaries high enough to attract the
best and the brightest, high enough to keep competent teachers in
the classroom, high enough to endow the profession with the dignity
that it deserves.
 &HT;    But nowhere does Bush earnestly address the issue of teacher
salaries. When speaking most recently to the editorial board of my
newspaper, the St. Petersburg Times, he claimed that he could
improve teaching by increasing requirements for certification,
rating colleges of education on their performance and raising
college admission standards for prospective teachers. These
measures are part of a larger effort, not solutions unto
themselves.
 &HT;    Unlike conservative politicians, like Bush and others, who tell
rich retirees and other right-wingers what they want to hear,
administrators and professors _ who direct the nation's colleges of
education _ struggle daily to attract, instruct, train and, of
course, retain the nation's public school teachers.
 &HT;    A few months ago, Roderick J. McDavis, dean of the University of
Florida College of Education, told me how _ if he had the authority
_ he would attract excellent teachers who will not automatically
abandon the classroom if another job comes along.
 &HT;    ``From the standpoint of recruitment, we need to increase
salaries. That's No. 1. Today, when high school and middle school
students look at careers, whether it's right or wrong, they look at
how much money they can expect to earn. I think that's especially
true with men. Young men tend not to look at education as a career
path because they don't feel they'll be able to earn enough money
to take care of a family. So, we've got to find a way to increase
beginning salaries for teachers and long-term career salaries.''
 &HT;    Under an incentives program, the state is supposed to either
help pay off loans or reimburse tuition costs for new or veteran
teachers who agree to take courses that prepare them for positions
in ``critical shortage areas'' such as special education, science
and math _ but has been postponing or welching on payments.
 &HT;    Why are we having this problem? Because elected officials
apparently do not think that money for teachers is important enough
to place them high on the list of legislative priorities.
 &HT;    The current problem can be fixed by the governor and legislators
simply by transferring funds. For the long term, however, they need
to pass legislation that permanently guarantees adequate funding
for the program.
 &HT;    A rarely told story is that the overwhelming majority of public
school teachers are caring, generous professionals who willingly
compensate for the stinginess of their districts, as borne out in a
survey by the National Education Association. In 1996, the NEA
asked teachers how much of their own money they spent during the
previous school year to meet the needs of their students.
 &HT;    Incredibly, 94 percent said that they had spent an average of
$408 on everything from stickers to pencils to paper to pizza to
shoes and clothing.
 &HT;    And what do elected officials and the rest of society give
teachers for their generosity? Hostility from parents, unruly
charges, mountains of paperwork, unsupportive principals and
superintendents, unnavigable bureaucracy, lousy legislation, low
salaries _ and disrespect.
 &HT;    As Florida, and other states, rush to improve public education
by implementing vouchers, establishing charter schools, testing
students every year from third through 10th grades and raising
standards for state-sponsored college scholarships, officials
should listen to the University of Florida's McDavis.
 &HT;    ``We've got to start saying more positive things about public
education,'' McDavis said. ``You've got to give a young person a
reason to want to go into education. If all you read and hear about
schools is negative, it's a turn-off. The perception these days is
that our best and brightest do not go into teaching. Within our
communities, we need to do more to honor teachers in a way that
brings respect back to the profession. ... People don't tend to go
into a profession perceived to be disrespected.''
 &HT;    Unfortunately, the measures and the rhetoric coming out of the
state capital perpetuate disrespect. Because teachers have been
demonized, their concerns are virtually ignored. Only enlightened,
apolitical leadership can reverse this costly, destructive trend.

 &HT;    Although the elections of the year 2000 are still many months
away, if one tuned into the talking heads on Sunday morning or
picked up a local or national newspaper, it would seem they're just
around the corner.
 &HT;    Charmaine White Face, A Lakota woman living in Rapid City, S.D.,
served as the treasurer of the Oglala Sioux Tribe for a short time
several years ago. The tribal council ousted her because she was
investigating questionable expenditures of tribal money. She has
accused Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) of accepting a $10,000
contribution from the tribe. Sen. Daschle denies this.
 &HT;    Charmaine is concerned because she believes this alleged
contribution was illegal since the funds came from federal dollars.
Most expenditure from tribal funds come from their General Fund.
This fund is a mixture coming from many sources including
charitable donations and tax dollars collected by the tribe in a
tax sharing agreement with the state of South Dakota. It would be
nearly impossible to pin down exactly from which account a
political contribution originated. The tribe has denied making any
political contributions from any account holding federal dollars.
 &HT;    Tribal political action committees (PACs) are relatively new in
Indian country. In the past the Indian nations had little extra
money to contribute to non-Indian politicians. But as could be seen
last year when the tribes in Minnesota spent at least $186,000 on
political contributions, ``the times they are a-changing.'' The
extra, independent funds, generated by tribally owned and operated
casinos have made the difference. Tribes are more apt to contribute
to national and local political contenders today because they have
so much more to protect.
 &HT;    Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota made himself real popular with
the Indians of that state when he called tribal sovereignty an
``oxymoron.'' He said, ``Are you a part of the United States or are
you a sovereign nation? If you're your own sovereign nation, then
take care of yourselves.'' Whoa, Jesse! Tribes are recognized as
sovereign nations by the U.S. Constitution. Most of the federal
dollars they receive in aid from the federal government is provided
because of the treaty agreements they signed as sovereign nations.
 &HT;    I am told that the tribes did not contribute to Ventura's
campaign fund. They contributed instead to the campaign of his
opponent, Hubert Humphrey III. Sour grapes? Maybe.
 &HT;    Canterbury Park in Shakopee, Minn., will be pushing the
Legislature to allow them to put slot machines and blackjack tables
at their racetrack. This could put a severe crimp in the profits of
the Indian casinos located near Shakopee and Prairie Island. Tribal
leaders fear Ventura may be more apt to support this legislation
than his predecessor, Gov. Arne Carlson. His recent comments lend
credence to these fears. You can expect the tribes to put up many
PAC dollars for candidates supporting their opposition to the
Canterbury proposal.
 &HT;    According to a recent Associated Press story, Indian tribes are
among the largest contributors of Minnesota's 340 PACs. Because
many tribes now have independent dollars from their casinos and
bingo parlors, you can expect them to become much more active
politically. They realize that the local and national politicians
hold much of their future in their hands.
 &HT;    This becomes even more apparent when you realize the Oglala
Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation shifted its elections for
tribal officials to coincide with the national elections in
November. Several tribes are now doing this because historically,
Indian voters have turned out at a far higher rate for tribal
elections than for state or national elections.
 &HT;    For generations the tribes were whipsawed between the state and
national politicians. They lost millions of acres of land and
millions of dollars in minerals and natural resources at the hands
of politicians representing their constituents _ the white
ranchers, farmers, state governments, mining interests,
corporations and land speculators. At last tribes are able to hire
lawyers to represent their interests, and are able to contribute to
the campaigns of politicians who regard them as genuine
constituents. They are set to hang on to what little is left and,
if possible, expand upon it.
 &HT;    Perhaps Campaign 2000 is starting a little early, but you can
count on the Indian nations of America to be right in the middle of
it, PACs at the ready. I suspect that when Charmaine White Face
complained of a supposed $10,000 contribution to Daschle, she never
thought she'd see the day when this would be commonplace.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    If you're black or female, you get inferior health care.
 &HT;    That's the distressing, if not surprising, conclusion of a
recent study in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.
 &HT;    The study confirms what many women and African Americans already
suspected: There is bias in the way we are treated in the
health-care industry. ``The race and sex of a patient independently
influence how physicians manage chest pain,'' the study notes.
 &HT;    In the study, 720 physicians viewed taped interviews and
analyzed medical data of eight ``patients.'' Everything was
controlled: The ``patients'' used identical hand motions, dressed
in identical hospital gowns, and the camera position was identical
for all of the interviews. The ``patients'' were actors _ four
white patients and four black patients, equally split between
gender and ages of 55 and 70. All complained of the same symptoms.
 &HT;    The researchers concluded that ``the race and sex of the patient
were significantly associated with the physicians' decisions about
whether to make referrals for cardiac catheterization (a common
procedure to test the heart's blood vessels), with men and whites
more likely to be referred than women and blacks, respectively.''
It is the catheterization test that determines whether or not
cardiac surgery is needed.
 &HT;    When comparisons were done by gender and race, women and blacks
were only 60 percent as likely to be referred for cardiac
catheterization as men and whites. Black women were referred to the
procedure only 40 percent as often as white men.
 &HT;    As if that's not bad enough, Dr. Kevin Schulman of Georgetown
University Medical Center, one of the principal researchers, said
this bias most likely ``is an underestimate of what's occurring,''
because the doctors knew their decisions were being recorded,
though not why.
 &HT;    U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher, commenting on the study,
notes the severe consequences this bias could have: ``It's a matter
of life and death whether a patient gets cardiac catheterization
with a follow up of a coronary artery bypass or another therapy.
... Blacks are 40 percent more likely (than whites) to die of heart
disease, and this could be one factor.''
 &HT;    The researchers were unable to determine the exact reason for
the discrimination. ``Our study could not assess the form of
bias,'' they wrote. ``Bias may represent overt prejudice on the
part of physicians or, more likely, could be the result of
subconscious perceptions rather than deliberate actions or
thoughts.''
 &HT;    But for black patients and female patients does it really matter
whether the bias is overt prejudice or subconscious perceptions?
The end result _ inferior care _ is the same. The bottom line is
that race and sex are strong factors in determining whether or not
you will get a proper medical referral when it comes to something
as crucial as heart disease.
 &HT;    The study is a rebuff to those who think the playing field is
level and that prejudice and discrimination are only aberrant
behaviors. They aren't. We need to be ever-vigilant about their
effect on the fabric of our society.
 &HT;    So where do we go from here? The medical profession needs to add
some workshops and classes in unlearning prejudice and accepting
cultural differences both in medical school and in training beyond.
 &HT;    And black patients and female patients need to stand up for
every American's rights to non-discriminatory health care.

 By RAOUL LOWERY CONTRERAS 
 &HT;    (Raoul Lowery Contreras, Mexican American, is a columnist and
editorial board member of La Prensa San Diego. He hosts his own
radio talk show on KOGO-AM.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    British expatriots at New York's National Review and Forbes
magazines toss verbal bricks at non-English speaking immigrants and
falsely accuse them of not contributing to the economy, which they
do; of not learning English, which they do; and, of not
assimilating and becoming good Americans, which they do. Actually,
it's these British critics who don't assimilate, but that's a topic
for another column.
 &HT;    At hand is the question: do the majority of immigrants, most of
whom are Hispanic, assimilate into American culture? First,
language arts _ Do they learn English? Yes, the 1990 Census showed
flash cards to native-Spanish speakers that self-graded English
speaking ability. Some 90 percent of the interviewees said they
spoke English well. Of course, that's subjective, but isn't the
view that they don't, subjective also? So, whom do we believe, the
Madison Avenue British transplants, or the Census Bureau that
interviewed thousands of people?
 &HT;    As to contributions to the economy, while the British work for
salaries at magazines and journals, immigrants tend to form
businesses. Which class is more valuable, a handful of writers and
editors, or hundreds of thousands of business owners and employers?
The acknowledged tendency of immigrants to form businesses,
especially among the Mexican immigrants, is transforming an entire
community of 20 million into an entrepreneurial class. A Mexican
and Mexican American class that is less dependent on government
assistance than ever.
 &HT;    Studies show that these immigrants are particularly brand-name
conscious; and spend larger shares of their income on rent and food
than most people, thus injecting a constant cash flow into
neighborhoods long abandoned by previous European immigrants and in
the case of Los Angeles, neighborhoods abandoned by blacks.
 &HT;    Interestingly, they spend larger amounts per capita on movies,
video rentals and premium cable channels. In a previous life, I set
sales records for cable sales for a large company by selling HBO to
Spanish-speaking households who used repetitive movies to learn
English.
 &HT;    Using these facts as a base, what do Hispanics watch on
television and can we use their viewing habits as indicators of
assimilation, the remaining category of behavior that the British
emigres in New York point out as a deficiency of Hispanic
immigrants.
 &HT;    According to the Nielsen Hispanic Television Index, Hispanics
rated ``Seinfeld'' as No. 1; ``ER'' second and ``Monday Night
Football'' third. Football aside, the Hispanic funny bone continues
with ``Friends' tied with ``Veronica's Closet'' for fourth.
Seriousness infects the Hispanic households with the ``X-Files''
(No. 7), and ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' tied for 9th with ``Party of
Five.'' The viewing habits of blacks are totally different from
those of Hispanics and Anglos (non-Hispanic whites), except for
some football.
 &HT;    What's interesting here is that we already know from the 1990
Census that most Hispanics consider themselves to be English
speakers, good English-speakers. And we know from the Census Bureau
that children of Spanish-speaking immigrants tend to be bilingual
and that their children hardly speak Spanish at all. These facts
are generally ignored by the media and by the anti-immigrant
xenophobes among us. In fact, the widespread perception is the
opposite of the facts.
 &HT;    But, the truth and facts all come home with these Nielsen
television reports, don't they?
 &HT;    For example, among Hispanic viewers 12-17 years of age, 15 of
the top 20 shows they enjoy are also in the top 20 for ALL American
viewers in the same age group. Among Hispanic viewers 50 years of
age plus, 15 of their top viewed shows were the same as ALL
Americans of that age group.
 &HT;    Among the top 20 shows that Hispanics watch, only one, ``ER''
has any Hispanic principals, proving that shows that intentionally
place Hispanics in view don't necessarily draw Hispanic viewers. In
contrast, among the top shows viewed by blacks, most have black
characters. While there is a noticeable absence of Hispanics on
television, before or behind the cameras, featuring a Hispanic
actor doesn't guarantee success for any television show among
Hispanic viewers.
 &HT;    This survey was not conducted in homes where much of the TV
viewing is in Spanish because such places are only in demographic
pockets around the country and Spanish-language television isn't
available in all 50 states. Thus, the survey features
English-speaking and bi-lingual homes only. But doesn't that
include most of the 30,000,000 Hispanics. Again, over 90 percent of
Hispanics identified themselves as `good' to `excellent' English
speakers in the 1990 Census.
 &HT;    While most favorite Hispanic programming parallels that of the
rest of the country, some questions present themselves vis-a-vis
the Hispanic top 20. Why does the ``Wonderful World of Disney''
rank 15th with them, but only 44th with the rest of the country?
``Touched by an Angel'' is No. 6 among all Americans, but only 17th
with Hispanics. ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' is the 9th most watched
show by Hispanics, but only 46th among the rest of America.
Hispanics rank ``Sabrina, Teenage Witch'' 20th, while the rest of
America ranks it 61st. And, among Hispanics, ``The Simpsons'' ranks
13th, while the rest of America ranks ``The Simpsons'' 31st.
 &HT;    There are some differences between Hispanic viewers and the rest
of the country, but they tend to be minor. The most obvious
conclusion one can reach is that Hispanic households that speak
English and/or are bi-lingual are almost totally assimilated into
American culture.
 &HT;    At least they like Jerry Seinfeld, ``Friends'' and football. You
can't get more American than that, can you?

 &HT;    
 &HT;    British expatriots at New York's National Review and Forbes
magazines toss verbal bricks at non-English speaking immigrants and
falsely accuse them of not contributing to the economy, which they
do; of not learning English, which they do; and, of not
assimilating and becoming good Americans, which they do. Actually,
it's these British critics who don't assimilate, but that's a topic
for another column.
 &HT;    At hand is the question: do the majority of immigrants, most of
whom are Hispanic, assimilate into American culture? First,
language arts _ Do they learn English? Yes, the 1990 Census showed
flash cards to native-Spanish speakers that self-graded English
speaking ability. Some 90 percent of the interviewees said they
spoke English well. Of course, that's subjective, but isn't the
view that they don't, subjective also? So, whom do we believe, the
Madison Avenue British transplants, or the Census Bureau that
interviewed thousands of people?
 &HT;    As to contributions to the economy, while the British work for
salaries at magazines and journals, immigrants tend to form
businesses. Which class is more valuable, a handful of writers and
editors, or hundreds of thousands of business owners and employers?
The acknowledged tendency of immigrants to form businesses,
especially among the Mexican immigrants, is transforming an entire
community of 20 million into an entrepreneurial class. A Mexican
and Mexican American class that is less dependent on government
assistance than ever.
 &HT;    Studies show that these immigrants are particularly brand-name
conscious; and spend larger shares of their income on rent and food
than most people, thus injecting a constant cash flow into
neighborhoods long abandoned by previous European immigrants and in
the case of Los Angeles, neighborhoods abandoned by blacks.
 &HT;    Interestingly, they spend larger amounts per capita on movies,
video rentals and premium cable channels. In a previous life, I set
sales records for cable sales for a large company by selling HBO to
Spanish-speaking households who used repetitive movies to learn
English.
 &HT;    Using these facts as a base, what do Hispanics watch on
television and can we use their viewing habits as indicators of
assimilation, the remaining category of behavior that the British
emigres in New York point out as a deficiency of Hispanic
immigrants.
 &HT;    According to the Nielsen Hispanic Television Index, Hispanics
rated ``Seinfeld'' as No. 1; ``ER'' second and ``Monday Night
Football'' third. Football aside, the Hispanic funny bone continues
with ``Friends' tied with ``Veronica's Closet'' for fourth.
Seriousness infects the Hispanic households with the ``X-Files''
(No. 7), and ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' tied for 9th with ``Party of
Five.'' The viewing habits of blacks are totally different from
those of Hispanics and Anglos (non-Hispanic whites), except for
some football.
 &HT;    What's interesting here is that we already know from the 1990

 By JENNIFER CHING 
 c. 1999 A. Magazine)
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Times have certainly changed since the classical exoticism of
``Diary of a Geisha Girl,'' the 1959 first-person account (``as
told to'' author William Vaneer) of a Japanese geisha who comes to
America and pursues her life-calling as a prostitute.
 &HT;    The diversity of today's readers and critics has raised the
degree of scrutiny on white authors taking on such `ethnic'
projects. Then again, when Puccini's overwrought ``Madame
Butterfly'' is merely transformed into Broadway's gaudy ``Miss
Saigon,'' can we really say we've made progress?
 &HT;    Arthur Golden's ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' became a word-of-mouth
bestseller and critical hit last year, prompting Steven Spielberg
to direct an upcoming film version.
 &HT;    ``Rarely has a world so closed and foreign been evoked with such
natural assurance,'' raved John Burnham Schwartz in The New Yorker.
Journalist Pico Iyer proclaims in the publisher's notes, ``I still
can't quite believe that an American male can so seamlessly enter
the soul of a Japanese woman with such perfection.''
 &HT;    Lurking in the shadows of all the hype, however, is an
uncomfortable double standard in debate over authorship and
authenticity, one that arises when narration jumps the thin line
separating memoir from fiction. Reviews cite author Arthur Golden's
Ivy League background and exhaustive research with great
acclamation. Proclaiming that the story and characters transcend
`authenticity,' critics praised the historical accuracy and
surprising depth of Sayuri, the geisha who faces love and loss in
thick, Gothic romance style. Little skepticism has been voiced,
particularly because Golden's identity is situated so far away from
a 1930s geisha.
 &HT;    At issue is not the quality of the text or the credentials of
the author, but the absence of critical voices examining these
cultural projects and the ease with which the American public
embraces a white male's appropriation of a geisha's story.
Authenticity is a terribly messy issue for both the writer and the
critic _ if it is actually possible to divorce the two identities
from each other. The `truth' is a political and literary minefield
for biographers, who are subject to the incessant reality checks of
their readers. Authors of fiction, on the other hand, can hijack
history without criticism (the literary imagination, after all, is
an expansive, forgiving space).
 &HT;    Asian American literary critics have largely refrained from
voicing skepticism for ``Memoirs,'' ignoring the impact of such
books on Asian Americans. Other recent novels, such as David
Gutterson's ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' and Danielle Steel's
``Silent Honor,'' employ Asian American history as a backdrop to
fictional tales. But while such works have created a literary
frenzy around the `discovery' of events such as the internment of
Japanese Americans during World War II, they have done so through
an inherently limiting lens.
 &HT;    Both (albeit vastly different) novels frame the internment
experiences of Japanese American women by their affairs with white
men. Although point of view is, of course, the author's choice, the
mass marketing of these works has the effect of relegating the
historical and fictional writings of Japanese Americans such as
Hisaye Yamamoto to the margins.
 &HT;    And while the publishing industry acknowledges that Asian and
Asian American culture is hot, it is unwilling to embrace writers
that go beyond the accepted, comfortably `authentic' narratives
that ponder worn themes of the struggle between East and West or
between the `old country' and America.
 &HT;    The answer is not for the Asian American literary community to
gripe each time a white author rides to commercial success on the
back of Asian American history, but to push a dialogue on
authenticity _ regardless of ethnicity _ into the popular
conversation. White authors and publishers have become savvy in
recent years about justifying ethnic pursuits. But while Kimiko's
innocent sexual exploits in ``Diary of a Geisha Girl'' now seem
outlandishly dated, appropriation continues unfettered unless
critics speak out.
 &HT;    Knopf sent vintage kimonos to bookstores for ``Memoirs'''
publicity, for example, and actress Bernadette Dunne read the novel
for the audiocasette version with a lilting accent. And the
`accents' that riddle Richard Olen Butler's narrative voices in his
1993 Pulitzer Prize-winning collection of short stories, ``A Good
Scent from a Strange Mountain,'' are short-shrift imitations of
real Vietnamese American voices.
 &HT;    Asian American writers, meanwhile, face their own authenticity
dilemma, one that has long plagued writers of color. Perhaps all
writers are `cultural impersonators,' as literary critic Henry
Louis Gates, Jr. argues. The fondness of publishers for the sales
value of `authentic' tales (read: ones that emphasize the typified
struggle with ethnicity and outsider themes) means Asian American
writers are ultimately bound by the straitjacket of mainstream
perception.
 &HT;    When my mother and I watched ``The Joy Luck Club'' on video
recently, I was hoping to engage her in an intense, generation
gap-filling experience. Instead, she kept shaking her head at the
screen. ``It's so fake,'' complained my mother. ``All this
melodrama. Who walks around talking about swan feathers?''
 &HT;    I wonder if ``My Joy Luck Club: Memoirs of My Aunties' Horrors
in China'' would have been more authentic to my mother, or if there
is greater `truth' to a purportedly biographical narrative. When
Maxine Hong Kingston's ``Woman Warrior: Memoirs of Girlbood Among
Ghosts'' received a National Book Award in 1975, many Asian
American writers were incensed by the publisher's decision to
market the book as nonfiction (viewed as a strategic decision in
order to guarantee an award for Kingston, who was otherwise
predicted to lose in the fiction category to Toni Morrison). In the
years since, however, ``Woman Warrior'' has become part of the
ethnic canon of biographic literature and a requirement for many
history, literature and women's studies classes.
 &HT;    ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' seems to demand charitable readings, for
many find it difficult to criticize another person's experience, as
lived or as researched extensively.
 &HT;    The same goes for ``The Accidental Asian,'' a 1997 autobiography
by Harvard law student Eric Liu that skirts the line between
personal and social commentary. Several reviewers praised Liu's
honesty, while few examined his privileged perspective and
assimilationist arguments. The reaction to ``The Accidental Asian''
gets to the core of political and literary divisions in criticism;
writing quality and anecdotal interest are lost among concerns that
popular success anoints Liu as our `spokesperson.'
 &HT;    These issues recall debates that have long plagued minority
writers, from Zora Neale Hurston and Ralph Ellison to contemporary
Mexican American author Richard Rodriguez. The competition is
vicious for authors of color that yearn to speak out beyond the
comfortable niches of established themes. Liu lives (as most of us
do) on the intersections of ethnic identities that don't define
themselves clearly into convenient political categories. The
struggle to tell `real' stories of divergent minority experiences
is alive and well.
 &HT;    ``There's really no such thing as authenticity,'' a friend
emails to me as I write this commentary. ``There's only good
writing and boring writing.''
 &HT;    As a writer, I understand his claim and implicitly trust it. As
a critic, however, I also recognize that such a judgment is bound
by the realness of an author's voice and project to me, a visceral
impression that cannot be separated from my own storytelling and
the world that I see: the world where the responsibility of
exposure is often ignored or passed onto an imagined community of
responsible, enlightened readers.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Times have certainly changed since the classical exoticism of
``Diary of a Geisha Girl,'' the 1959 first-person account (``as
told to'' author William Vaneer) of a Japanese geisha who comes to
America and pursues her life-calling as a prostitute.
 &HT;    The diversity of today's readers and critics has raised the
degree of scrutiny on white authors taking on such `ethnic'
projects. Then again, when Puccini's overwrought ``Madame
Butterfly'' is merely transformed into Broadway's gaudy ``Miss
Saigon,'' can we really say we've made progress?
 &HT;    Arthur Golden's ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' became a word-of-mouth
bestseller and critical hit last year, prompting Steven Spielberg
to direct an upcoming film version.
 &HT;    ``Rarely has a world so closed and foreign been evoked with such
natural assurance,'' raved John Burnham Schwartz in The New Yorker.
Journalist Pico Iyer proclaims in the publisher's notes, ``I still
can't quite believe that an American male can so seamlessly enter
the soul of a Japanese woman with such perfection.''
 &HT;    Lurking in the shadows of all the hype, however, is an
uncomfortable double standard in debate over authorship and
authenticity, one that arises when narration jumps the thin line
separating memoir from fiction. Reviews cite author Arthur Golden's
Ivy League background and exhaustive research with great
acclamation. Proclaiming that the story and characters transcend
`authenticity,' critics praised the historical accuracy and
surprising depth of Sayuri, the geisha who faces love and loss in
thick, Gothic romance style. Little skepticism has been voiced,
particularly because Golden's identity is situated so far away from
a 1930s geisha.
 &HT;    At issue is not the quality of the text or the credentials of
the author, but the absence of critical voices examining these
cultural projects and the ease with which the American public
embraces a white male's appropriation of a geisha's story.
Authenticity is a terribly messy issue for both the writer and the
critic _ if it is actually possible to divorce the two identities
from each other. The `truth' is a political and literary minefield
for biographers, who are subject to the incessant reality checks of
their readers. Authors of fiction, on the other hand, can hijack
history without criticism (the literary imagination, after all, is
an expansive, forgiving space).
 &HT;    Asian American literary critics have largely refrained from
voicing skepticism for ``Memoirs,'' ignoring the impact of such
books on Asian Americans. Other recent novels, such as David
Gutterson's ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' and Danielle Steel's
``Silent Honor,'' employ Asian American history as a backdrop to
fictional tales. But while such works have created a literary
frenzy around the `discovery' of events such as the internment of
Japanese Americans during World War II, they have done so through
an inherently limiting lens.
 &HT;    Both (albeit vastly different) novels frame the internment
experiences of Japanese American women by their affairs with white
men. Although point of view is, of course, the author's choice, the
mass marketing of these works has the effect of relegating the
historical and fictional writings of Japanese Americans such as
Hisaye Yamamoto to the margins.
 &HT;    And while the publishing industry acknowledges that Asian and
Asian American culture is hot, it is unwilling to embrace writers
that go beyond the accepted, comfortably `authentic' narratives
that ponder worn themes of the struggle between East and West or
between the `old country' and America.
 &HT;    The answer is not for the Asian American literary community to
gripe each time a white author rides to commercial success on the
back of Asian American history, but to push a dialogue on
authenticity _ regardless of ethnicity _ into the popular
conversation. White authors and publishers have become savvy in
recent years about justifying ethnic pursuits. But while Kimiko's
innocent sexual exploits in ``Diary of a Geisha Girl'' now seem
outlandishly dated, appropriation continues unfettered unless
critics speak out.
 &HT;    Knopf sent vintage kimonos to bookstores for ``Memoirs'''
publicity, for example, and actress Bernadette Dunne read the novel
for the audiocasette version with a lilting accent. And the
`accents' that riddle Richard Olen Butler's narrative voices in his
1993 Pulitzer Prize-winning collection of short stories, ``A Good
Scent from a Strange Mountain,'' are short-shrift imitations of
real Vietnamese American voices.
 &HT;    Asian American writers, meanwhile, face their own authenticity
dilemma, one that has long plagued writers of color. Perhaps all
writers are `cultural impersonators,' as literary critic Henry
Louis Gates, Jr. argues. The fondness of publishers for the sales
value of `authentic' tales (read: ones that emphasize the typified
struggle with ethnicity and outsider themes) means Asian American
writers are ultimately bound by the straitjacket of mainstream
perception.
 &HT;    When my mother and I watched ``The Joy Luck Club'' on video
recently, I was hoping to engage her in an intense, generation
gap-filling experience. Instead, she kept shaking her head at the
screen. ``It's so fake,'' complained my mother. ``All this
melodrama. Who walks around talking about swan feathers?''
 &HT;    I wonder if ``My Joy Luck Club: Memoirs of My Aunties' Horrors
in China'' would have been more authentic to my mother, or if there
is greater `truth' to a purportedly biographical narrative. When
Maxine Hong Kingston's ``Woman Warrior: Memoirs of Girlbood Among
Ghosts'' received a National Book Award in 1975, many Asian
American writers were incensed by the publisher's decision to
market the book as nonfiction (viewed as a strategic decision in
order to guarantee an award for Kingston, who was otherwise
predicted to lose in the fiction category to Toni Morrison). In the
years since, however, ``Woman Warrior'' has become part of the
ethnic canon of biographic literature and a requirement for many
history, literature and women's studies classes.
 &HT;    ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' seems to demand charitable readings, for
many find it difficult to criticize another person's experience, as
lived or as researched extensively.
 &HT;    The same goes for ``The Accidental Asian,'' a 1997 autobiography
by Harvard law student Eric Liu that skirts the line between
personal and social commentary. Several reviewers praised Liu's
honesty, while few examined his privileged perspective and
assimilationist arguments. The reaction to ``The Accidental Asian''
gets to the core of political and literary divisions in criticism;
writing quality and anecdotal interest are lost among concerns that
popular success anoints Liu as our `spokesperson.'
 &HT;    These issues recall debates that have long plagued minority
writers, from Zora Neale Hurston and Ralph Ellison to contemporary
Mexican American author Richard Rodriguez. The competition is
vicious for authors of color that yearn to speak out beyond the
comfortable niches of established themes. Liu lives (as most of us
do) on the intersections of ethnic identities that don't define
themselves clearly into convenient political categories. The
struggle to tell `real' stories of divergent minority experiences
is alive and well.
 &HT;    ``There's really no such thing as authenticity,'' a friend
emails to me as I write this commentary. ``There's only good
writing and boring writing.''
 &HT;    As a writer, I understand his claim and implicitly trust it. As
a critic, however, I also recognize that such a judgment is bound
by the realness of an author's voice and project to me, a visceral
impression that cannot be separated from my own storytelling and
the world that I see: the world where the responsibility of
exposure is often ignored or passed onto an imagined community of
responsible, enlightened readers.

   FOR ONCE, PUT THE TEACHERS FIRST. Politicians refuse to face the
hard truth about what needs to be done to improve public education:
Put teachers first, insists columnist Bill Maxwell. Lawmakers
should stop the sleight-of-hand approach to education immediately,
he says, and pass legislation that sets teacher salaries high
enough to attract the best and the brightest and to keep competent
teachers in the classroom, high enough to endow the profession with
the dignity _ and respect _ that it deserves. ``Without good
teaching, effective learning is virtually impossible for most
students,'' he writes.

   INDIANS' NEW POWER TOOL: PACS. Tribal political action
committees (PACs) are relatively new in Indian country, notes
columnist Tim Giago. In the past the Indian nations had little
extra money to contribute to non-Indian politicians. ``But the
times they are a-changing,'' he says, as could be seen last year
when the tribes in Minnesota spent at least $186,000 on political
contributions. The extra, independent funds, generated by tribally
owned and operated casinos have made the difference. ``Tribes are
more apt to contribute to national and local political contenders
today because they have so much more to protect,'' he points out.

columnist Akilah Monifa. ``The race and sex of a patient
independently influence how physicians manage chest pain,'' the
study showed. U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher, commenting on the
study, notes the severe consequences this bias could have: ``It's a
matter of life and death whether a patient gets ... therapy. Blacks

Television viewers and their preferences, reported in a Nielsen
Hispanic Television survey, is a good index, observes columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras. There are some differences between Hispanic
viewers and the rest of the country, but they tend to be minor, he
says. The most obvious conclusion one can reach is that Hispanic
households that speak English and/or are bi-lingual are almost
totally assimilated into American culture. ``At least they like

   FOR ONCE, PUT THE TEACHERS FIRST. Politicians refuse to face the
hard truth about what needs to be done to improve public education:
Put teachers first, insists columnist Bill Maxwell. Lawmakers
should stop the sleight-of-hand approach to education immediately,
he says, and pass legislation that sets teacher salaries high
enough to attract the best and the brightest and to keep competent
teachers in the classroom, high enough to endow the profession with
the dignity _ and respect _ that it deserves. ``Without good
teaching, effective learning is virtually impossible for most
students,'' he writes.

   INDIANS' NEW POWER TOOL: PACS. Tribal political action
committees (PACs) are relatively new in Indian country, notes
columnist Tim Giago. In the past the Indian nations had little
extra money to contribute to non-Indian politicians. ``But the
times they are a-changing,'' he says, as could be seen last year
when the tribes in Minnesota spent at least $186,000 on political
contributions. The extra, independent funds, generated by tribally
owned and operated casinos have made the difference. ``Tribes are
more apt to contribute to national and local political contenders
today because they have so much more to protect,'' he points out.

   RACE AND GENDER DO MATTER IN HEALTH CARE. A recent study
published in the New England Journal of Medicine, confirms what
many women and African Americans already suspected: There is bias
in the way they are treated in the health-care industry, notes
columnist Akilah Monifa. ``The race and sex of a patient
independently influence how physicians manage chest pain,'' the
study showed. U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher, commenting on the
study, notes the severe consequences this bias could have: ``It's a
matter of life and death whether a patient gets ... therapy. Blacks
are 40 percent more likely (than whites) to die of heart disease,
and this could be one factor.''

Television viewers and their preferences, reported in a Nielsen

KINGS PUT DUCHESNE ON WAIVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Steve Duchesne's career as a King may end as soon as
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   And if it isn't over that quickly, the likelihood is it will be
within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings placed the disappointing Duchesne on waivers Wednesday
morning, triggering a 48-hour period during which any NHL team can
claim him. If the 33-year-old rushing defenseman is not claimed by
this morning - which is likely, because his contract calls for him
to receive $7.5 million the next two years - there's a strong
possibility the Kings will deal him by Tuesday's NHL trading
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Other options would be to buy out Duchesne's contract (for
two-thirds of the remainder, or $5 million), demote him to a
minor-league team, or keep him on their roster. Kings general
manager Dave Taylor, saying the decision to waive Duchesne was his
alone, sounded Thursday very much like a man anxious to cut his
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt at this time, this was our best option,'' Taylor said.
``I don't think Steve has performed as well as he's capable of
performing. Maybe a change of scenery would be best for Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne was the Kings' key acquisition last summer, signed to a
three-year, $11.75-million contract as a free agent after a
56-point season with the St. Louis Blues. Duchesne, who began his
career with the Kings in 1986, has 23 points this season and a
minus-6 defensive rating. He has shown no sign of turning his game
around, has been a defensive liability, and has been scratched from
the Kings' last four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm disappointed that the team's giving up on me
like this after seven months,'' said Duchesne, clearly distraught.
But I'm staying positive and I'm going to be ready for whatever
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne's contract contains a no-trade clause, meaning any deal
the Kings make would be subject to his approval. It is believed
that Philadelphia and Ottawa - teams Duchesne previously has played
for - are teams that might be interested in acquiring his services.
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne is believed to be amenable to a trade, realizing his
situation with the Kings has deteriorated. But any team that would
trade for Duchesne almost certainly would demand that the Kings pay
a sizable portion of his salary, which Taylor acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we signed Steve, we felt we were getting a veteran player
who would play well for us and provide some offense from the blue
line,'' Taylor said. ``And I think Steve would admit he hasn't
played as well as he's capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt bitter that the Kings have lost faith in him in
a relatively short amount of time, Duchesne said, ``Why would I
badmouth somebody? I've got a lot of respect for Dave, and I've got
a lot of respect for (Coach Larry Robinson). I'm trying to have a
little class. The game has been good to me. Why should I start
blasting the organization, my coach or GM?''

MODANO'S ALL-AROUND PLAY MERITS MVP REGARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In Pittsburgh, fans are convinced Jaromir Jagr is the
NHL's most valuable player. In Philadelphia, the push is for Eric
Lindros. In Ottawa, they're pumping Alexei Yashin as a possible
candidate for MVP.
</P>
<P>
   And in North Texas...
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more of a team concept,'' Stars center Mike Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but whatever happened to the
best-player-on-the-best-team concept of MVP? What about Mike
Modano?
</P>
<P>
   With Yashin leading the NHL in goals with 39 and bringing his
Eastern Conference-leading Senators into Reunion Arena tonight for
a 7:30 showdown with the NHL-leading Stars, talk of the Hart Trophy
can move to center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr seems to have one hand on the Hart Trophy, and with a
league-leading 103 points, the trophy is Jagr's to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Modano is not among the top five scorers in the league, but his
value might not be best measured in scoring. The NHL is a game that
puts a premium on multi-dimensional two-way players _ those who can
carry the puck into the offensive end and keep an opponent from
doing so at the other end _ and that's a dimension Modano gives the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say he's one of the top three or four players in the
league right now,'' said Stars winger Brett Hull, who is expected
to return to the lineup tonight after missing 11 games with a
hamstring pull. ``He just does so many things so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano ranks eighth in the NHL in scoring with 73 points (30
goals, 43 assists). What's more, he has 26 points more than Hull,
the next-best Star. Modano hasn't missed a game this season, is a
plus 27, has scored only six of his 30 goals on the power play and
has contributed three short-handed goals and six game-winners.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he is consistent in all areas instead of
dominant in one or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has really become a complete player, that's the greatest
thing you can say about him right now,'' said Stars defenseman
Craig Ludwig, who has been Modano's teammate for the past eight
seasons. ``The criticism people used to have about Mo is he would
take games off. They don't say that about him anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the Stars' most reliable scorer, Modano has
turned into their top checking center. Under coach Ken Hitchcock's
system, Modano typically is paired against an opponent's best
players. He often is on the ice against Peter Forsberg and Joe
Sakic of the Colorado Avalanche or Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya of
the Mighty Ducks. He sees his share of Jagr and the Red Wings'
Steve Yzerman and he'll likely go head-to-head with Yashin tonight.
</P>
<P>
   It's a part of the job he has come to love.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came up, it was all about scoring, who could
score the most, who could have 50 goals, who could have 100
points,'' Modano said. ``If you didn't score at least one goal, you
had a bad game back then.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the league has changed and my role has changed. Now, I can
do other things, maybe not score, and still have a good game.
That's a good feeling when you can go into a game and know there
are a lot of other things besides scoring that you can do to help
your team win.''
</P>
<P>
   And Modano has helped his team to a league-best 42-13-12 record.
Granted, he has a great supporting cast. As part of the plan to
check the other team's best players, Modano is accompanied by
winger Jere Lehtinen and defenseman Derian Hatcher on most shifts.
Lehtinen is last year's winner of the Selke Trophy for best
defensive forward and will again be in the running for the award
this season. Hatcher might well be the best defensive defenseman in
the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   And Modano is proving this season that he can also function
without some of his top teammates. In games without Hull, Modano
has 10 goals and 12 assists for 22 points in 21 games and the Stars
are 11-3-7 in that span. The Stars as a team have struggled at
5-5-2 with second-line center Joe Nieuwendyk out of the lineup, but
Modano has responded with five goals and nine assists (14 points)
in those 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at how to stop that team, the first thing you
look at is how do you stop Modano,'' said Penguins winger Rob
Brown, a former Modano linemate with the 1993-94 Stars. ``He's done
such a great job of learning the checking game that he creates
turnovers with his defense and can convert with his offense. It's a
different game in the NHL now, you have to be a two-way player, and
he's done a great job of adapting.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano still would need a hard push in the final 15 games to
reach 100 points _ a plateau he has coveted since he started his
career. However, he's not that far away from tying his
single-season career high of 93 points.
</P>
<P>
   And even if he didn't hit a scoring high, the season's success
meter awaits Modano and his teammates in the playoffs. And then
Modano might be able to truly measure how valuable he is to his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to work a long time just to get to this point, so I'm
not going to do anything to change that plan,'' said Modano, who
was seventh in MVP voting two seasons ago. ``There's always going
to be an emphasis on numbers. But so far, \Rbeing a two-way
player\S has worked for me, so I'm just going to keep working hard
at that and not worry about the individual stuff.''

MAVERICKS' PLANS GO ASTRAY, AND THAT'S JUST THE HALF OF IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Don Nelson's original plan was to get the
Mavericks pointed in the right direction with a few wins, then turn
the franchise's coaching reins over to his son, Donnie, in time for
the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   However, at the rate the Mavericks have won games since the
elder Nelson took over as coach, his son may have to wait a little
longer before becoming the team's coach.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reasons, the Mavericks have not produced their fair
share of victories under Nelson. They enter the midpoint of this
shortened, 50-game season with tonight's road game at 7 against the
Detroit Pistons as owners of a disappointing 8-16 record.
</P>
<P>
   This season's Mavericks' team has blown too many leads and
doesn't seem to have the killer instinct to put teams away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all right,'' guard Michael Finley said in summing up the
first half of the season. ``It's nothing to write home about and
nothing to brag about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a long ways to go to get to the point where we
want to be and where we need to be in order to get some respect
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks reach the midway point coming off perhaps the most
embarrassing loss of the season _ an 88-87 defeat to a New Jersey
Nets team that was 3-17 before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Short lineups. Tall lineups. A lineup of former Phoenix Suns
players. Rookie Dirk Nowitzki, a 7-footer, guarding 5-3 Muggsy
Bogues. Nine different starting lineups.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has tried it all, and the shuffling has only netted the
Mavericks a .333 winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said injuries to starting small forward Cedric Ceballos
and backup point guard Robert Pack hindered his team's growth
process. Ceballos fractured both wrists 13 games into this season
and is probably out for the season. Ceballos was averaging 12.5
points a game, and was a viable offensive weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Pack suffered a slightly torn right hamstring Saturday and is
sidelined for two to four weeks. He was a spark plug when spelling
Steve Nash. Pack had averaged 9.4 points and 3.3 assists in only
19.6 minutes of playing time, and did not publicly complain when
Nelson gave the starting point guard position to Nash in training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Nash signed a six-year, $33 million contract extension before
the season, then suffered through his worst NBA shooting slump. He
also was hampered by a fractured nose and a viral infection, but
has tried to keep his spirits high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've struggled, but we've shown some life here, and we've
shown some potential and some ability,'' Nash said. ``It's been
obviously an unfortunate record.'' Import misfires Nowitzki's
struggles are what surprised Nelson the most. Nelson went so far as
to convince Mavericks owner Ross Perot Jr. to fly to Germany last
summer to meet Nowitzki's parents and convince him to come to the
NBA immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki, who is accustomed to playing only two games in a week
instead of the plethora of back-to-back games the NBA has on its
docket, tried to tell Nelson he wasn't ready for the NBA. After
Nowitzki made nine starts, he said Nelson asked him if it was OK to
remove him from the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping he wouldn't struggle at all, but I do understand
it,'' Nelson said. ``I knew it was a possibility, but he's playing
pretty well right now.'' The few, the proud Gary Trent, Shawn
Bradley, A.C. Green and Pack were the most impressive Mavericks
players during the first half of the season. Trent, who becomes a
free agent after this season, is a monster on the low box and has a
soft shooting touch.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had his offensive game de-emphasized by Nelson, and he
responded with some of the best basketball of his six-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think if we would have stayed healthy we would have
been right where we wanted to be,'' Nelson said. ``But we lost two
major players, and that makes it pretty tough for us right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've struggled in scoring, and that's where the loss of
Cedric doubly hurts us. And we had gotten used to Pack giving us
that spark off the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Mavericks are still misguidedly talking about making
a run for the playoffs this season. But first-half losses to teams
like Vancouver, Golden State and New Jersey took care of that.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Trent, Green and Samaki Walker become free
agents on July 1. The Mavericks are also already over the salary
cap, and they dealt their 1999 first-round pick _ it will be a
lottery pick that Nelson reluctantly didn't protect for at least
one year _ to Phoenix in the Nash trade.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, unless Nelson tweaks the roster with some
low-rent players, Mavericks fans can expect what they see this
season next season.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 16-50 last season after he fired Jim Cleamons and took
over the coaching chores on Dec. 4, 1998, knows he needs a lot of
players to step up if the Mavericks hope to improve their record
from the first half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for better play and a real improvement in Nash and
just everybody,'' he said. ``We really need everybody to improve _
Nowitzki _ everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   If the improvement doesn't come, Nelson may be coaching well
into the millennium, and his son's coaching career will be placed
on hold.

TEXAS-BRED SIBLINGS ON SERIOUS RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big brother is muscular, dark and handsome. But with those
killer looks comes a bad-boy attitude. He can be stubborn and
impatient, and has trouble with authority figures.
</P>
<P>
   The well-behaved little brother is lanky instead of buff, with a
lighter complexion and an easygoing personality.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know they were related, you might never suspect.
But they share an important trait: 4-year-old racehorse Desert Air
and his 3-year-old brother Desert Demon run fast and bring home
money. Houston-based Mt. Brilliant Stable can be thankful for that.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Desert Air traveled from New Orleans to Hot
Springs, Ark., to capture the $125,000 Razorback Handicap at
Oaklawn Park. Now Desert Demon makes the same trip for tomorrow's
$125,000 Rebel Stakes, and he should be one of the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he runs like his brother did,'' trainer Mike Stidham said,
``we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Stidham's best efforts, Desert Air is a front-runner
loathe to let another horse take the lead. Desert Demon doesn't
mind hanging with bottom-dwellers at the back of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   In the Risen Star Stakes at Fair Grounds on Feb. 21, Desert
Demon looked like a winner in midstretch when he charged from 10th
place into second. He couldn't keep up with Ecton Park, Answer
Lively and Kimberlite Pipe in the last furlong, but finished a
solid fourth. That performance looks even better in hindsight,
since those three colts dominated Sunday in the Louisiana Derby.
</P>
<P>
   A son of Manzotti, Desert Demon has two victories from 11
starts, and he took the $150,000 Gallery Furniture Juvenile on
Texas Champions Day in December at Sam Houston. Should he win
tomorrow, he likely will return for the Arkansas Derby on April 3.
Otherwise, he is a possibility for the Lone Star Derby at Grand
Prairie on April 18, since Stidham will be stabled there.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Krone, having a sensational meet at Fair Grounds, will
ride Desert Demon in the 1 1-16 mile Rebel, which has drawn an
11-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now, he's shown us that he's probably a cut below the
best 3-year-olds,'' said Stidham, known for objectivity in
evaluating his horses. ``I'm hoping that as he matures a little
bit, maybe he can catch up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching up is something Desert Demon loves to do. Desert Air,
on the other hand, would rather blaze the trail.
</P>
<P>
   For all their differences, the Texas-bred siblings make a nice
one-two punch.
</P>
<P>
   EXPLOIT'S EARLY RETIREMENT
</P>
<P>
   Three-time stakes winner Exploit lost for the first time
Saturday, and then the news got worse. He chipped his left knee in
the race and has been retired.
</P>
<P>
   The near-black 3-year-old colt, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis,
had been among the leading Kentucky Derby contenders and was
undefeated in five races until stablemate Prime Timber passed him
in the stretch of the San Felipe Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Exploit would have needed knee surgery to run again, trainer Bob
Baffert said, but now he won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so sought after as a sire, we decided to retire him,''
Baffert explained. ``It's a big blow to the barn. He's been a great
little racehorse.''
</P>
<P>
   Fret not for Baffert. As he tries to make it three in a row in
the Derby, his list of 3-year-olds still includes Prime Timber,
Straight Man and General Challenge, plus his filly tandem of
Excellent Meeting and Silverbulletday.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is proper to sympathize with those who backed
Exploit in the first two pools of the Kentucky Derby Future Wager.
He closed at 8-1 in the first pool, 14-1 in the second, and took
$37,780 in nationwide wagers that now are worthless.
QUICK HITS
GOING ONCE, GOING TWICE
</P>
<P>
   Fasig Tipton's 2-year-olds in training sale will be held at Lone
Star Park at Grand Prairie at 10 a.m. Tuesday. Buyers have an
opportunity for a sneak preview when the horses work out over the
surface at 10 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The auction, sponsored by the Texas Thoroughbred Association,
features 267 juveniles. The overall numbers are lower than last
year, but sales officials said the quality of the horses is up.
</P>
<P>
   MUSICAL BARNS
</P>
<P>
   Desert Hero, another key Triple Crown prospect preparing for the
April 10 Santa Anita Derby, has a new trainer. Richard Mandella
replaces Wally Dollase, fired this week as private trainer of the
California division of Saudi Arabian Prince Ahmed Salman's
Thoroughbred Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Dollase had done well in his brief stint with Salman, so the
firing came as a surprise. The horses will be distributed among
several other trainers. Baffert was asked to take a few, but
declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel right about what they did,'' Baffert told ``Daily
Racing Form''.
</P>
<P>
   HERE AND THERE
</P>
<P>
   Oaklawn Park leading jockey Tim Doocy, who tied for second in
last summer's Lone Star Park standings, will instead ride this
summer at Prairie Meadows in Iowa, said his agent, Jack Moody.
Returning to Lone Star after a year's absence will be Donnie Meche,
fifth in the races-won standings at Fair Grounds, ahead of Marlon
St. Julien.
</P>
<P>
   Brocco, an 8-year-old Kentucky sire, has been sold to an
Australian farm due to libido problems. But any effort to get him
interested in his job is time well spent. Two record-breaking
2-year-old colts sold this week at a California in-training auction
_ one for $2 million, the other for $1.1 million _ and both were
sons of Brocco.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Derby winner Kimberlite Pipe has been nominated to the
Triple Crown for the $6,000 late fee. He probably will run next in
the April 10 Blue Grass Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet is due to compete in the April 3 Oaklawn Handicap
against Behrens and Precocity. Banshee Breeze and Manistique are
being pointed for Oaklawn's Apple Blossom Handicap on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop arrived in Dubai on Monday for the March 28 Dubai
World Cup, a $5 million race. Silver Charm and Malek are to show up
today.

ST. JOHN'S UPSETS SECOND-SEEDED MARYLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The evening was not a total loss for
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The Terrapins' band got a huge reaction from the Thompson-Boling
Arena crowd before the game when it broke into the Tennessee fight
song, ``Rocky Top.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, however, the Maryland basketball team hit rocky
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's pitched the Terps into an abyss with a 20-0
first-half run Thursday night that spanned more than eight minutes
and the South Region's No. 2 seed could never climb out.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm (28-8) kept rising with a 76-62 victory that
thrust them into the Elite Eight for the first time since 1991, one
step away from the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God we got off to a great start against a great team and
our kids played great defense,'' St. John's coach Mike Jarvis said.
``The first half was incredible. Until I was told we had a 20-0 run
I didn't know how good it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it worked out we needed the 20 points. So the journey
continues. We're going to try enjoy the moment because they don't
come very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Erick Barkley led the Red Storm with 24 points and nine assists,
seven in the first half when St. John's built a 38-19 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with a lot of heart and really played together
tonight,'' Barkley said. ``We executed on offense and broke their
pressure in the first half, which got us off to a great start.''
</P>
<P>
   Down by one almost 12 minutes into the game, St. John's turned
things around.
</P>
<P>
   It began innocently enough when guard Bootsy Thornton flashed
loose underneath for two layups on feeds from Ron Artest and
Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   The blitz gained momentum when Barkley made a 3-pointer from the
top of the key and Artest scored on a breakaway jam in transition.
The Red Storm got two free throws each from Collin Charles and
Barkley and Tyrone Grant closed the half with a layup.
</P>
<P>
   Stunningly, St. John's went in at the half with a 19-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we could have done that was together,'' Thornton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland went the last 8:26 of the half without scoring. For the
first 20 minutes, the Terrapins made 7-of-23 shots and had 13
turnovers. Second team All American Steve Francis scored two of his
13 points in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland's drought continued for two minutes of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Terps did make the game mildly interesting with a 21-4
sprint of its own to close to 60-51 with 5:19 to play. But St.
John's kicked the Terps back down when Barkley hit a 3-pointer and
Reggie Jessie made two free throws in succession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little lapse in the second half, but we stayed
together and that's how you win,'' Artest said. nn

AGING GWYNN HASN'T LOST ARTFUL TOUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Tony Gwynn figures he has something to prove
this year. He ``slumped'' to a .321 average in 1998, so he figures
he has to show he still can hit, that he's not slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been that way my whole career,'' he said. ``My career
really is based on proving people wrong. `He doesn't hit with any
power, he doesn't drive in any runs, he doesn't do this, he doesn't
do that. He doesn't run well, he doesn't look like an athlete.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn is right. And he's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't hit with any power. In the Year of the Homer, he hit
16. It was one short of his career high.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't drive in runs. He's topped 100 once in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   He's no longer a gazelle, either, in speed or build. He looks
more like a beachball than an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn, San Diego Padres outfielder and one of the nicest
guys in the history of professional sports, is quite simply one of
the greatest hitters ever.
</P>
<P>
   His career batting average is .339. Only 15 players in the
history of the game can beat that. It's the best in the game since
Ted Williams retired with a .344 average in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   He is 72 hits shy of 3,000, the magical number that will punch
his ticket to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Sure he has his critics, but then there are people who didn't
think Frank Sinatra could sing or that ``Casablanca'' was a great
movie.
</P>
<P>
   No, Gwynn has nothing to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting a baseball is an art, and Gwynn is the game's
Michelangelo. His paintbrush is the small, skinny bat he uses to
unerringly make contact with balls coming in at all speeds and
angles.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting a baseball might be the most difficult thing to do in
sports, but Gwynn makes it look ridiculously easy. He failed to
make contact with less than 6 percent of his swings last year. He
struck out only 18 times.
</P>
<P>
   So what if right field typically is manned by sluggers such as
Sammy Sosa, Juan Gonzalez, Manny Ramirez and Vladimir Guerrero? So
what if he doesn't crush 450-foot home runs? Gwynn is still worth
the price of admission, even in an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Giants the other day he took a couple of strikes,
then flicked out his bat and slapped a clean single the opposite
way. Artistry in action.
</P>
<P>
   Hit No. 3,000 might be an opposite-field poke. It might be a
line drive up the middle. It might be a ground ball between first
and second. Chances are it will be a single, although Gwynn is on
the verge of passing Babe Ruth in the all-time doubles category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want it to be clean,'' he said. ``I'll take an infield
chopper as long as it clean. The bottom line is, a hit's a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   A hit is a hit, and Gwynn's been cranking them out with
regularity since he made it to the majors to stay in 1983. He hit
.309 in 86 games that year. The following season he batted .351 and
won the first of his eight batting titles.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Boggs was the standard good hitters were measured by when
Gwynn came up. Boggs hit .349 as a rookie in 1982, and set an
American League record with 200 hits in the next seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boggs was the guy to try to emulate and try to keep pace
with,'' Gwynn said. ``For a long time there he was leading the
pace. Nobody was even close.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boggs began to slow down in 1992, when he hit .259. Gwynn,
who never has hit less than .300 in a full season at any level,
surged at about the same time. He ``only'' hit .317 that season,
but followed that with averages of .358, .394, .368, .353 and .372.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs is also closing in on the magical 3,000 and the sure
ticket to the Hall of Fame; he needs 78 hits. But Gwynn will get
there first.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last five or six years, it's kind of flipped over,''
Gwynn said. ``I'm proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn openly talks about 3,000 hits and what it means. He knows
it's a number that no critic can argue with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that everybody who's got 3,000 hits is in the Hall of
Fame, except for Pete Rose and the guys who haven't been out of the
game five years,'' he said. ``Yeah, my resume looks pretty good.
There are some things I've done that haven't often been done. But
that's the one thing I feel like I have to do to validate what all
I've done. It's out there. You just kind of methodically plod your
way to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, just like Michelangelo methodically painted that ceiling.

 &HT;    Florida's Foley says he won't be Senate candidate
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ One of the first to get in and now one
of the first to get out, U.S. Rep. Mark Foley announced Thursday
that he's not going to run for the U.S. Senate after all.
</P>
<P>
   Groans of political despair could be heard throughout Palm Beach
County and the Treasure Coast as those who hoped to replace Foley
and those who hoped to replace them suddenly became without hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really? You're kidding,'' said a stunned Palm Beach County
Commissioner Mary McCarty, who has been busy building a
congressional campaign. ``He's not running? Really? You're kidding.
You're kidding. Really? Can I call you back?''
</P>
<P>
   Foley, a West Palm Beach Republican in his third term, appeared
to be a certain candidate in the race to replace Connie Mack, who
announced last week that he will not run for re-election next year.
Rumors about Mack's departure had spread for weeks and Foley was
among a handful of Florida congressmen and other elected officials
who said they would run for Mack's Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more ambitious members of Congress, Foley has long
dreamed of running for statewide office. As he began sending
signals that he would soon announce the formation of his campaign,
McCarty, a Republican, and Democratic Palm Beach County
Commissioner Carol Roberts both talked about running for his seat.
That spawned talk among others about running for their jobs. And on
and on it went.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and McCarty both talked to Washington political
consultants. McCarty even announced the formation of a 10-member
exploratory committee and began polling the district about how
voters feel about a female candidate. Roberts took a more pragmatic
approach, saying she wasn't going to move too fast until Foley made
a formal announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark started talking in the last week with some of his most
trusted supporters and they told him it was not in his best
interest to run for the Senate,'' said a source close to Foley.
``They very candidly said that Mark was not likely to win. I think
it took some time for him to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently appointed to the Ways and Means Committee, Foley, who
is a deputy whip, also was persuaded that he should be content with
building on his increasingly influential role in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just looked at the race and I think I have a pretty good gut
instinct for what can be done realistically and what can't,'' Foley
said. ``I feel really comfortable with this decision and I wanted
to make it quickly enough so that other people looking at my seat
and other races could make their own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those caught in the backwash are West Palm Beach City
Commissioner Al Zucaro, who was thinking about running for Roberts'
seat, and Boca Raton City Councilwoman Wanda Thayer, who was
looking at McCarty's seat. Zucaro said he wasn't too disappointed
because, ``I think there's enough to do in the city of West Palm
Beach that it wasn't a foregone conclusion that I would run.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state Democratic Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson
said Thursday he will run for Mack's seat. Other potential
Democratic candidates include U.S. Rep. Peter Deutsch of Fort
Lauderdale and former state Sen. Rick Dantzler of Winter Haven.
Deutsch, who like Foley has all but formally announced, is now
hinting that because of family considerations he may change his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Altamonte Springs) is a probable
candidate for Mack's Senate seat. Potential Republican candidates
include state Senate President Toni Jennings of Orlando and U.S.
Reps. Charles Canady of Lakeland and Joe Scarborough of Pensacola.
Former state Sen. Charlie Crist of St. Petersburg, who ran against
U.S. Sen. Bob Graham last year, says he will run.
</P>
<P>
   For those who dreamed of Foley's seat, they can now turn their
eyes toward U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Boca Raton. Wexler said he
will make a decision about running for the Senate during the
summer. Wexler seems less inclined to run than Foley was, but if he
does, another Palm Beach County commissioner, Democrat Burt
Aaronson, says he may run for that seat. If Wexler leaves, the
political dominoes will begin falling all over again.

TORRE WILL MISS 6-12 WEEKS FOLLOWING SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The doctor who performed prostate cancer surgery
Thursday on Joe Torre deemed the two-and-a-half-hour procedure
successful, said that he does not believe the cancer has spread and
speculated that Torre would not be able to return and manage the
Yankees for at least another six to 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Catalona, a Washington University urologic surgeon
and prostate cancer researcher, spoke optimistically about Torre
making a full recovery and spoke repeatedly about when the
58-year-old manager should try to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very routine,'' Catalona said at a news conference at
Barnes-Jewish Hospital after he had removed Torre's prostate gland
and surrounding lymph nodes. ``I think he had a very early prostate
cancer and the operation went very smoothly. Everything looked
fine. The lymph nodes looked clean. The prostate looked clean. It
was a routine, textbook operation. It went very well.''
</P>
<P>
   While Catalona said he would not know if Torre's cancer had
spread until the pathology specimen is returned in a few days, he
indicated that Torre's tumor was so negligible that it was only
detectable because his annual prostate specific antigen test was
elevated. Catalona said that when he held Torre's prostate after
removing the walnut-sized gland at the base of the bladder, it did
not seem abnormal and added that the lymph nodes looked
``absolutely normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Catalona, who described Torre as being ``very amusing'' and
telling jokes until the moment he received anesthesia, emphasized
again and again the importance of Torre not trying to return to his
manager's job prematurely. During the 20-minute news conference,
Catalona made five references to the significance of Torre letting
himself recover properly and seemed to be intimating that his
absence from wearing a Yankee uniform will probably stretch to the
three-month mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The usual patient is in the hospital for three to four days
and then we don't like them to return to full activity until at
least six weeks,'' Catalona said. ``I'm going to encourage him not
to go back too soon. He's got a very stressful job. I hope he'll
give himself time to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, who received a call from Ali Torre, Joe's
wife, shortly after the surgery ended, said he planned to echo
Catalano's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe knows that I want him to take his time coming back,''
Steinbrenner said in a phone interview from Tampa, Fla. ``That's
his life. This brings everything into perspective for people when
you have cancer and life-threatening situations. Everything else
doesn't matter, especially the score of a baseball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre's cancer was diagnosed during a PSA test, the early
detection test for prostate cancer that was developed by Catalona
in 1989. Catalona is also responsible for the safer version of the
radical prostatectomy that he performed on Torre. This reduces the
risk of damaging the nerves on the back side of the prostate, which
are responsible for potency, and the sphincter muscle, which is at
the tip of the prostate and is responsible for urinary control.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old doctor, who has performed more than 2,200
operations using this nerve-sparing technique, likened the nerves
that are located along the wall of the rectum to railroad tracks
and said the prostate sits above them like a box car.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do is just very gently lift the prostate and
separate it from these nerves and remove it without damaging the
surrounding nerves,'' said Catalano, who was recommended to Torre
by Bob Watson, the former general manager of the Yankees who also
had prostate cancer surgery done by Catalano.
</P>
<P>
   The most common side effects of this surgery are incontinence or
impotence, and although Catalano said that impotence is always a
possibility, he said Torre's surgery went so well that he should
regain normal function. Torre is one of an estimated 179,000 men
who will contract prostate cancer in the United States this year,
according to Barnes-Jewish Hospital. It is also estimated that
37,000 will die from the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Catalona said Torre will be walking more and eating
within a few days, he reiterated that the manager should not return
to work ``before six to 12 weeks.'' He said that stress is a major
factor in the rate of recovery and that some of his patients who
have returned to work too soon have not felt normal for months
after the surgery. Catalona usually recommends that patients return
to work on a part-time basis, leaving after half a day to go home
and take a nap.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with the kind of job that Joe Torre has, he can't take a
nap at noon,'' Catalona said. ``It's going to be important for him
to allow himself time to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, who is content with Don Zimmer as the interim
Yankee manager, was also adamant about preventing Torre from doing
too much too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wehling, a former public relations director with the St.
Louis Cardinals who acted as Torre's spokesman Thursday, said the
manager was thankful for the hundreds of cards, calls and flowers
he had received. Wehling suggested that Torre is quite aware of the
importance of healing. ``Certainly, his priority is this situation
and his family and he wants to take care of that and make sure that
when he returns to the Yankees that he's either at 100 percent or
close to it,'' Wehling said.
</P>
<P>
   While Catalona said there is always a chance that cancer can
recur, he spoke positively about Torre's future. If the cancer is
totally contained in the prostate and does not spread and the
prostate is removed, then the cancer should be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the survival statistics on men who have
organ-confined prostate cancer,'' Catalona said, ``their survival
is almost the same as the general population who never had prostate
cancer to begin with.''

AT COURSE WHERE HOUSE WAS DESTROYED, LOWERY SHOOTS A 67 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ As Steve Lowery walked down the fourth fairway
Thursday, he passed by the charred remains of his home.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, Lowery's house was destroyed by a fire fueled by
30-mile per hour winds. Lowery's wife, their three children and the
family dog escaped unharmed. But the pain, the memories and the
helpless feelings that accompany such a catastrophe remain fresh in
Lowery's mind.
</P>
<P>
   All of that made Lowery's performance Thursday even more
improbable and impressive. Shooting a five-under-par 67 at Bay Hill
Club and Lodge on the golf course adjacent to where his home used
to stand, Lowery was just one stroke behind the leader, Tim Herron,
after the opening round of the Bay Hill Invitational. In third
place was Dicky Pride (68), another Bay Hill resident and a close
friend of Lowery's, who has helped him cope with the fire.
</P>
<P>
   It was another eventful day for Lowery in what has been an
emotional period. Anyone who walks down the fourth fairway at Bay
Hill can see the remnants of Lowery's house. Even a faint smell of
smoke is still in the air. Yet, when Lowery passed by Thursday, he
refused to look. Lowery knows he is fortunate, and he is determined
to get on with his life.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, he made a par at No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that it helps put the fire behind me,'' Lowery said of
Thursday's round, which included six birdies and just one bogey.
``Hopefully, I can get back to playing golf. We are really doing
good. My family is good. We are going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The community has helped by opening its arms. Arnold Palmer and
his wife, Winnie, let the Lowerys use a guest house at Bay Hill,
where they stayed immediately after the fire. Since then, the
Lowerys have moved into a condominium in nearby Isleworth, where
Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara live. Lowery can even laugh about the
ordeal now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to get past it where it's a little more
lighthearted,'' Lowery said, smiling. ``I'm OK with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery and his wife have not decided if they will build a house
at the same location or settle elsewhere. But, with his family back
to a somewhat normal routine, Lowery has returned to golf, although
not a day goes by when he does not think of the fire or how it
could have been far more tragic.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is still unknown, although an electrical problem in
the attic wiring is suspected. Lowery's wife, Kathryn, and
children, Kristen, 7; Lauren, 3), and Stephen Brent, 1, all left
the house quickly after the blaze started around 2 p.m. Bogey,
their English springer spaniel, ran into the house during the blaze
and was hiding under a coffee table, but he was rescued by
firefighters. Fire trucks responded within four minutes, but by the
time they arrived, the fire was out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had happened at night ... ,'' said Pride, his voice
trailing off. ``We're all very thankful.''
</P>
<P>
   While the fire was taking place, Lowery was competing in the
final round of the Tucson Open. His wife called PGA Tour officials,
but left instructions that her husband should not be told the news
until his round ended. Lowery, who has not won on the tour since
the 1994 Sprint International, closed to within one stroke before
tying for 20th place.
</P>
<P>
   It would make a great story if Lowery won this weekend. But he
has already gained the admiration of many. ``I tell you what, he
made a good par on four,'' Pride said. ``Steve's a very mentally
tough person. He's been through a lot. I'm sure they'll get through
it. But I wouldn't wish this on anyone.''

IMPRISONED COMPUTER HACKER REACHES PLEA AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Mitnick, perhaps the nation's most notorious
computer hacker, has reached a plea agreement with federal
prosecutors that could pave the way for his release from prison,
people involved in the situation said.
</P>
<P>
   David Schindler, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles,
confirmed that a filing had been made under seal in U.S. District
Court here regarding Mitnick, but he would not discuss its contents
or even confirm that it was a plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Randolph, Mitnick's attorney, also declined to comment.
``I don't want to impact the case involving my client,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that under the
agreement, Mitnick would plead guilty and be given a sentence of
about five years. But he could be out of prison in about a year,
given the time he has already served and time off for good
behavior. A person involved in the matter said the article was
essentially accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement, which still requires the approval of U.S.
District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer, who is presiding over the case,
would avoid a trial that was scheduled to begin in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick, 35, who has been breaking into computers since he was a
teen-ager, is charged with stealing millions of dollars' worth of
software from several manufacturers during a two-and-a-half-year
spree. He is also charged with stealing files containing passwords
and fraudulently using cellular phones in order to make calls and
computer connections untraceable.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick has been in prison since February 1995, when he was
arrested in North Carolina after being a fugitive for more than two
years. His downfall came, officials said, after he broke into the
home computer of Tsutomu Shimomura, a researcher at the San Diego
Supercomputer Center, who then began a sophisticated electronic
hunt for the intruder.
</P>
<P>
   Even after he leaves prison, Mitnick will not be able to use a
computer or a cellular phone for three years without approval from
his probation officer, according to a ruling in a previous
conviction by Pfaelzer. It is possible new conditions will be added
to his probation by the latest settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick first came to national attention as a lonely, overweight
teen-ager who broke into a North American Air Defense Command
computer. He became the embodiment of the hacker _ a young person
subsisting on munchies and working through the night tirelessly
trying to penetrate corporate and government computers using a
personal computer and modem. Some experts said such activities
posed a grave threat to electronic commerce and privacy. Others saw
them as little more than juvenile pranks.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick's supporters say the extent of his crimes has been
exaggerated by the government and the press. A World Wide Web site
set up by such supporters maintains that Mitnick never profited
from his actions and instead did what he did as a means of
``satisfying his intellectual curiosity and applying Yankee
ingenuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackers broke into the The New York Times site on the World Wide
Web last September, protesting articles by John Markoff, a Times
reporter who covered Mitnick's arrest and then wrote a book about
the case with Shimomura.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rasch, former head of the Department of Justice's computer
crime unit, said Mitnick had symbolic importance but that ``he's
not that important'' in terms of damage done. ``The techniques that
he had and the skills that he had were about average,'' said Rasch,
who is now a lawyer working on Internet issues. ``He was just more
aggressive at doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Kevin are not the real threat to electronic
commerce,'' he continued, adding that bigger threats come from
foreign governments and a company's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if found guilty on all counts and given a stiff sentence,
Mitnick could have been in jail for years to come. ``Both Mitnick
and DePayne face life sentences, not realistically but
potentially,'' said Richard Sherman, an attorney for Lewis DePayne,
a friend of Mitnick's who is a co-defendant in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four years Mitnick has been in prison this time, 22
months were for violating an earlier parole and for cellular phone
fraud. The rest of the time he has been awaiting trial on the
current charges. The judge denied him bail because he had fled in
1992 when he was being sought by law enforcement officials for
violating the terms of the earlier parole.

RODMAN MAY RETURN BEFORE END OF TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Dennis Rodman, apparently nearing the end of his
combination therapy session/vacation, has informed the team he will
return soon, perhaps by the end of this road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, speaking by telephone from an undisclosed location,
spoke with Lakers executive vice president Jerry West and general
manager Mitch Kupchak on Thursday, according to team spokesman John
Black.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he's making some progress taking care of the personal
business he had to take care of, and he expects to join the team
within the next several days,'' Black said. ``Hopefully, on this
road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   That should be welcome news to a team that's struggling
defensively and in danger of posting a losing record on this
six-game trip. Rodman skipped practice in Los Angeles last
Saturday, then told the team he would not be traveling with it.
Since then, the Lakers have gone from 9-0 with Rodman to 1-2
without him.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman is being paid his $12,195 per game, but he's also being
fined by the team for the extended absence, during which he's
reportedly spent time in at least a couple of vacation spots.
</P>
<P>
   He's averaging 10.3 rebounds and 24.8 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   Wohl's return: Dave Wohl, who joined the team Thursday for his
second stint as an assistant coach, said he's happy to be back,
even if it's just for the last 26 games of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've ever been with this team before, it's an experience
you don't forget,'' said Wohl, an assistant from 1982-85. ``The
three years I was here we got to the Finals, we won the
championship. I think any player or coach would look upon that as a
tremendous achievement. . . . It's kind of like coming home in a
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Kurt Rambis' coach, Wohl now works for him. And he's not at
all surprised at Rambis' success as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see he had a mind even at the end of his playing
career, where he was like another coach on the floor. It's kind of
nice to see him grow into that role,'' Wohl said. ``He's very
organized, very focused, same personality. Unfortunately, some
people become a head coach and their whole personality changes.
That's gonna be one great advantage for him _ he is who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Always Blount: Corie Blount, waived by the Lakers last week,
played 12 minutes against his old mates as a Cleveland Cavalier on
Thursday. Blount, a Monrovia High graduate, said the parting was
amicable and that he asked to be let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my agent to see what he could do. I didn't want to sit
on the bench all year,'' said Blount, who was stuck on the bench
once Rodman arrived. ``I know it's a business. They've gotta do
what they've gotta do. . . . I wasn't heartbroken.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount said he also had offers from Vancouver, Seattle and
Denver _ where he would have been reunited with buddy Nick Van
Exel. Cleveland, he figured, offered the best opportunity for
significant playing time.

IOC ANNOUNCES SOME CHANGES, BUT STILL FACES CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Even as it offered a framework for
reform Thursday, the International Olympic Committee continued to
raise questions about just how vigorously it is determined to root
out corruption that has gravely damaged the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   While the committee made an experimental change Thursday,
forbidding members to visit the six cities bidding to become host
to the 2006 Winter Games, it also formed an ethics commission that
will be only partly independent.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics commission will consist of seven or eight persons, a
majority from outside the IOC. The commission members, however,
will be appointed by Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC president, and
will include as many as three IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether such a commission could be truly independent and
trustable, given the IOC's punctured credibility in the area of
ethics, Richard W. Pound, an executive board member from Montreal,
said: ``Wait and see who the outside people are. If they are my
sister, my brother and my cat, you can question it. We are trying
hard to make this work. We are not going to gloss it over.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch also named himself chairman of a reform commission
called IOC 2000, which was announced Thursday and will examine such
proposals as term limits, democratic elections, open meetings and
open financial records. Last month, Samaranch was sternly rebuffed
by American and European officials in his attempt to head an agency
to oversee a worldwide effort to control doping. Both the Americans
and Europeans felt he lacked credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch took no action when Pound told him of a million-dollar
bribe offer in the 1980s or when Toronto sent a lengthy warning in
1991 about abuses in the bidding process. Asked why he should head
the reform commission, the 78-year-old Samaranch said defiantly
Thursday: ``I am president of the IOC. This commission must be
presided over by the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The formation of the reform commission came a day after the
expulsion of six IOC members linked to the Salt Lake City bribery
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We promised to clean house; we did it,'' said Samaranch, who
vowed to complete his term, which ends in 2001. ``We promised to
study a new structure of the IOC; we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one worldwide corporate sponsor of the Games, however,
was not encouraged by the two-day meeting, during which the IOC had
promised to show that it was serious about widespread reform.
</P>
<P>
   David D'Alessandro, president of the John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co., said that the IOC seemed to set a double standard on
Wednesday, expelling members who asked for illicit gifts and favors
but not those who received improper benefits without asking.
</P>
<P>
   And he said that the IOC ``continued its incestuous nature'' by
not appointing a completely independent ethics commission and by
having Samaranch run its reform commission.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro also said that Samaranch showed a ``very weak
leadership position'' by saying he would study reform, rather than
demanding that certain changes be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Samaranch should have been much stronger,''
D'Alessandro said from Boston. ``He put the sponsors in a
wait-and-see attitude again. Absolutely nothing breathtakingly
performance-oriented happened. He didn't say: `We must have term
limits. Some of you will have to vote yourselves out of a job.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a potentially enterprise-killing scandal on his
hand,'' D'Alessandro continued. ``I see this as a continuation of
the nobility attitude: `Please media, please sponsors, leave us
alone and we will go off and study so we can come back with the
least that we can get away with.' It is a very weak leadership
position to appoint a study group when everybody knows what you
have to do. The sponsors shouldn't be saying all is well. We have
no idea whether there is going to be true reform.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Next, the IOC faces a hearing before the U.S. Senate Commerce
Committee on April 14. The committee chairman, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., is threatening to revoke the IOC's tax-exempt status in
the United States and to limit its access to television rights fees
paid by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time to study the problem has passed,'' McCain said. ``The
abuses are well-documented. It is time for the IOC to take action.
Until reforms are implemented, the IOC will be unable to restore
its reputation. All IOC members should act with speed to expedite
reforms that are badly needed.''
</P>
<P>
   If John Hancock lost the ability to deduct its sponsorship and
advertising fees, its costs would increase by 40 percent,
D'Alessandro said. Worldwide sponsorships cost $40 million and
more. Hancock, upset by the IOC's slow pace at reforming itself,
has already canceled negotiations with NBC for $20 million in
Olympic-related advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm afraid of is that this slow, torturous, weak
leadership is going to cause the Olympics to be devalued even more
than they already have been,'' D'Alessandro said.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, often criticized for its insular behavior, released
financial records Thursday that showed that it had a $207 million
bank balance at the end of 1998. The records also said that the IOC
paid $204,000 last year to cover the living expenses of Samaranch,
who is unpaid. &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 19:
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, Maj. Gen. David Hale's adulterous conduct with
the wives of four subordinates was a disgrace. Under military law,
it was also a crime. On the eve of his court-martial, the retired
general, after adamantly insisting on his innocence for months,
agreed to plead guilty to eight counts of misconduct for committing
adultery and lying to the Pentagon's deputy inspector general about
it. He could have been punished with up to 11 years in prison. The
sentence imposed by the judge at the court-martial _ a reprimand
and an order to pay $22,000 in penalties _ is surprisingly light
given the devastating effect his betrayals had on officers directly
under his command.
</P>
<P>
   Hale now bears the shame of being the highest-ranking officer to
be court-martialed since 1952. The conviction sends an important
message that the Army is getting serious about eradicating the
perception that senior officers are allowed to get away with sexual
transgressions that would result in charges against junior officers
and enlisted personnel.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself is progress. Last year Hale was allowed to retire
honorably and quietly after complaints were filed against him by
one of the wives. But public outrage at the case prompted Defense
Secretary William Cohen to bar officers accused of misconduct from
retiring until the charges against them are resolved. Given the
vigorous prosecution in 1997 of Sgt. Maj. Gene McKinney on sexual
misconduct charges, the Army cannot be seen as tolerating similar
behavior in its commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Hale maintains that his adulterous relationships, though
violations of the Code of Military Justice, were consensual. But
the affairs destroyed morale and trust among those under his
command. It is that consequence that makes his conduct worthy of
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   That is not necessarily true in all cases involving adultery
charges. The military should not be in the business of policing
private, consensual relationships that do not affect military
discipline. In fact, a Pentagon committee appointed by Cohen last
year recommended that adultery remain a crime under military law,
but be pursued only when the adultery disrupts order and the
functioning of the military unit. Those proposed guidelines are
still being reviewed. Even if they were in place, Hale's conduct
would remain culpable.

SPORTS COLUMN: POSTELL IS ST. JOHN'S SILENT SPIKE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ On a modest farm in Guyton, Ga., a
grandfather introduces his grandson to the virtues of patience and
delayed gratification. They greet the dawn and begin a routine that
has no tolerance for shortcuts.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Saturday ritual: wake up, eat, do chores. At the end
of the day, if tasks are completed to the grandfather's
satisfaction, the grandson can drive the tractor. This is how Lavor
Postell, the St. John's junior forward, learned the first crucial
basketball fundamental: moving without the ball.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Postell is St. John's silent spike, the subtle
reason St. John's basketball has re-emerged as a national power. A
dynamic new coach in Mike Jarvis, a star player in Ron Artest, a
phenomenal freshman guard in Erick Barkley. Then there's Postell, a
presence, much like faith, that is felt long before it's seen.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 games this season, Postell has come in and out of the
lineup. He is absorbed by the flow of a game, and then, like a
chameleon, takes whatever shape is needed to help propel the team
to victory. Sometimes he does so with his outside shot, sometimes
with passing or rebounding; consistently with defense. But he
almost always goes unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week against Indiana, Postell recognized the need to
attack. After two long jump shots he sliced through the Hoosiers'
defense for a pair of baskets, then scored on a resounding dunk
that permanently altered the game's flow.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Indiana players knew something had happened, but
they couldn't put a collective finger on it. There had been Artest
and Barkley, for sure. But there had been something else. Postell,
the Silent Spike, had spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Postell's mother and stepfather, Sarah and Fred Peterson,
notice; his high school coach, Willie Boston, notices. In fact, all
of Albany, Ga., notices.
</P>
<P>
   But for much of the nation, St. John's is the Ron Artest show.
``He's really not into all of that stuff,'' Sarah Peterson said.
``He's never been like that, always quiet, keeps to himself. If
people notice, they notice. His actions speak louder than words.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, as Jarvis began his first season as St. John's
coach, he felt the team would be better served if Postell, a
starter as a freshman and sophomore, came off the bench. Postell's
reaction to that change has as much to do with St. John's success
this season as his play does.
</P>
<P>
   He called his high school coach, called his mother, just so
Albany, Ga., would not be surprised. His reaction was like that of
the seasoned farmer who gets a dry spell when he expects rain. ``I
guess it's just something I'll have to adjust to,'' he said. He
almost immediately became a spark off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Through the benchings and unbenchings, Postell never considered
leaving the university. In an era when talented players' use of a
school is often mercenary, Postell never lost sight of the fact
that he had signed with the institution, not the coach. Brian
Mahoney had recruited him and left before Postell ever saw the
campus; Fran Fraschilla was dismissed after two seasons. Then came
a new regime and the loss of his starting role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him, `Did you sign with the coach or the school?'''
said Boston, Postell's coach at Westover High in Albany. ``Without
even hesitating, he said, `The school.'''
</P>
<P>
   Postell was born in Albany, his mother's only child. Her parents
played a major role in Lavor's upbringing and education, especially
her father, a minister who instilled hard work and the no-shortcut
approach to life in his grandson just as he had with nine children.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his peers moved on a fast track; Postell took the long
way. In 10th grade he took a job in a grocery store bagging
groceries, then he took a job at Dairy Queen. Every day, Postell's
mother sees the consequences of taking shortcuts. Sarah Peterson is
a corrections officer at Autry State Prison, where some of Lavor's
high school classmates are incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't his mother's job that made Postell see the right
path. ``I've worked here for five and a half years,'' his mother
said. ``He's been doing pretty good for a long time. He's quiet;
never says anything bad about anybody and he works hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Postell's grandfather died in 1994, on the eve of a state
championship game. The death had a disastrous effect on Postell's
performance but, almost overnight, helped put his goals in focus:
commitment to college education, basketball as a means of achieving
it. St. John's was the institution from which to receive it; New
York was the city in which to enjoy it. With goals so sharply
defined, it doesn't matter whether Postell is on the bench or off
it. &QL;

PATAKI TESTS WIDER APPEAL WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Looking more than ever like a candidate for
the Republican national ticket next year, New York Gov. George
Pataki made his first political trip to New Hampshire Thursday,
even as he acknowledged that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas should be
seen as the front-runner for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki joined a long list of politicians who, like models on a
runway, are taking their turns before the critical eyes of
Republican activists in this state. He held a private lunch meeting
with the party's state committee and was planning to address the
annual Lincoln Day dinner of the Manchester Republican Party
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with Pataki, his host, Stephen Duprey, the
state party chairman, backed away from his comment on Wednesday
that the governor was getting too late a start to compete with
presidential hopefuls like Bush, Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes,
who still have organizations left over from their 1996 campaigns.
New Hampshire's primary, the first in the nation, is 11 months
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me take part of my foot out of my mouth,'' Duprey began,
before insisting that Pataki could not be counted out. Yet moments
later, he said: ``Is it late to get into a race? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Pataki has coyly played the part of the not-quite
candidate, conceding that he is thinking of running for president
but declining to say when he will decide whether to formally enter
the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's trip, his first visit to New Hampshire in several
years, was packed with the trappings of an early campaign swing. A
jet chartered by his political action committee ferried him, his
aides and a contingent of reporters here from New York; he held two
fund-raisers before his dinner speech, both closed to the press; he
gave two television interviews, and at each stop his aides stood
ready with glossy folders filled with flattering newspaper
clippings about Pataki to hand to local reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The governor insisted that his purpose was simply to spread the
gospel of competency according to Republican governors. But as a
member of New Hampshire's Republican state committee said Thursday,
``He wouldn't be here if he weren't running.''
</P>
<P>
   Since winning re-election in November, Pataki has made a series
of trips around the country to raise his profile and test support
among party leaders. But he remains no more than an afterthought
when Republicans _ even those in New York _ are polled about their
choice of a presidential nominee in 2000, raising speculation that
he is really seeking the vice presidential slot. And as Duprey
noted, Pataki lags several other candidates in fund raising and
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, conceding the front-runner status of Bush, said:
``I think there's a great deal of reason to respect the candidacy
of Bush. He's been an outstanding governor, he has a national
network, and he's a terrific guy with a very broad vision and a
very successful background.'' But, he added, ``I think there are a
number of others out there who are very credible and strong
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's message here is the same one he took recently to
Missouri and Illinois: that the national image of the party should
be shaped more by governors like him who have executive experience
in solving problems and setting fiscal policy, and less by
congressional leaders and others who have focused on the
impeachment of President Clinton and on divisive social issues. Not
coincidentally, those issues put him at odds with the mass of
Republican primary voters around the country, since the governor
favors abortion rights and gay rights, raising serious questions
about his ability to compete in those primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we seemed like an angry party and a negative
party that was opposed to things, as opposed to being positive and
talking about the issues we've been able to deal with and handle
successfully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That message might be more palatable to Republicans in this
crucial state than in Missouri, where Pataki's speech a few weeks
ago was boycotted by the party's social conservatives. Several
members of the state party committee here said that New Hampshire's
brand of conservatism, like Pataki's, did not focus on people's
private conduct. Duprey, the state party chairman for six of the
last seven years, favors abortion rights.

 By CLAIRE POOLE 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ When Alfredo Lira started his tortilla business in
Houston in 1977, he didnt have a dime. All he had was a former
chicken-processing factory with a leaky roof and some used
tortilla-making equipment from his brother-in-law. But with help
from friends and hard work, he built La Espiga de Oro into one of
the biggest tortilla-making operations in the region, supplying
supermarkets, restaurants and food distributors across the country.
His tortillas have even accompanied NASA astronauts into space.
 &HT;    But when Mexican food companies like Gruma and Grupo Industrial
Bimbo came inquiring about buying his business, the dapper
54-year-old politely showed them the door. ``Im not ready to
retire,'' he says.
 &HT;    Unlike Lira, though, most mom and pop tortilla shops across the
United States are taking the check. The corner tortillerias, as
they are known, are now being flattened by Mexicos food giants.
 &HT;    Bigger than bagels. Over the past 10 years, Gruma, through its
U.S. subsidiary, Las Colinas, Texas-based Mission Foods, has been
buying up tortilla factories across the country, from as far south
as El Paso, Texas, to as far north as Zillah, Washington. Bimbo
entered the fray five years ago, first buying up tortilla plants in
Oklahoma City and Toledo, Ohio, and later acquiring Fort
Worth-based Mrs Bairds Bakeries in March 1998 for an undisclosed
price. And in June 1998, Agrobios, a unit of Mexican conglomerate
Desc, shelled out US$142 million for Authentic Specialty Foods
Inc., a publicly traded company in Grand Prairie, Texas that owned
the Victoria line of salsas, chiles and other Mexican products as
well as three tortilla makers in Texas.
 &HT;    Whats so tasty about the U.S. tortilla market? Its hot growth
rate. According to the Dallas-based Tortilla Industry Association
(TIA), U.S. sales of tortillas have mushroomed from $300 million in
1980 to well over $3 billion last year, exceeding sales of all
other ethnic breads combined, including bagels, croissants and pita
bread. Over the past 15 years, tortilla sales been growing around
10 percent per year and are now accelerating toward $4 billion by
2000.
 &HT;    Why such growth? The increasing population of Mexicans in the
U.S. _ up about 40 percent to almost 19 million since 1990 _ is the
most obvious reason. But the biggest demand is coming from
non-Latinos, who are gobbling up almost 60 percent of all tortillas
sold in the U.S. Traditional soft tacos, crispy taco shells and the
more recent phenomenon, wraps, are being filled with everything
from meat to vegetables to pate. While the little Chihuahua may
say, ``Yo quiero Taco Bell,'' white-bread, national fast-food
chains, such as Long John Silvers and Subway, are serving tortillas
to the mainstream, too. ``The non-Hispanic culture has found that
the tortilla is a good piece of bread,'' says Irwin Steinberg,
president of the TIA, which has about 150 members. ``Its relatively
inexpensive and extremely healthy in terms of other breads you can
buy.''
 &HT;    Since thousands of years before Christ, people have been eating
tortillas in Mexico, but the flat, pancake-like food has never been
a particularly big growth business there. For years, the government
has kept a tight lid on tortilla prices. So Mexican companies
naturally followed migrants northward to take advantage of the
growing appetite for Mexican food and the ability to charge more
for a bag of tortillas _ about 55 to 60 cents per pound, versus 15
cents in Mexico.
 &HT;    While the government recently lifted price controls on
tortillas, its still not a booming business. When Mexicos
economically strapped consumers balked at paying more for their
precious staple, Mexican tortilla makers agreed to cap prices at
around 20 cents per pound, keeping a squeeze on margins. And
despite the convenience of buying packaged tortillas at a
supermarket, Mexicans still prefer buying freshly made product at
their corner tortilleria.
 &HT;    So for Mexicos major food companies, the big market for packaged
tortillas is the United States. ``Any company in Mexico is looking
for U.S. dollar revenues right now,'' says William Landers, who
follows Latin American food and beverage companies for Lehman
Brothers in New York. ``And Mexican food is still the most popular
food going.''
 &HT;    Through Mission Foods, Gruma has probably gone after the U.S.
tortilla market the longest _ and with the most gusto. Since
entering the U.S. in the late 1970s, it has built or acquired 13
tortilla factories in eight states. Gruma, whose U.S. sales
represent roughly half its US$ 1.3 billion total annual sales, now
controls the largest chunk of the U.S. tortilla market with about
24 percent, followed by Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson Foods (5
percent), and Omaha-based ConAgra and Bimbo (3 percent each).
 &HT;    There are still pockets of the country that Mission doesnt
reach, such as the Midwest and parts of the Eastern seaboard. So
Martin Ricoy, who was head of Kaiser-Roth _ the U.S. unit of
Mexican hosiery giant Synkro _ before becoming chief executive of
Mission two years ago, is on the prowl for new targets. ``Our
strategy is to grow internally but also through acquisitions,'' the
50-year-old Mexico City native says. ``We dont know that we ought
to be the dominant player. But we want to be the biggest player.''
 &HT;    Right now, 80 percent of Mission Foods $600 million in sales
comes from supermarket chains like Albertsons, Kroger and Vons; the
rest comes from the food service business, including national
fast-food chain Taco Bell and salty snacks company Frito-Lay. Thats
a more lucrative area currently dominated by Tyson that Ricoy would
like to develop further. ``Food service is an area where we believe
we still dont have our fair share, so were going after more share
dramatically,'' he says.
 &HT;    Takeovers a la mexicana. Last year, Mission had a big enough
presence that it began advertising on network TV in certain
markets. Its latest commercial, which recently played in pricey
prime-time on the CBS affiliate in Houston, shows a busy American
family rushing in and out of their kitchen, catching meals on the
fly. ``Wrap it. Roll it. Make it with Mission Tortillas,'' the
cheerful voice-over says. New TV commercials are in the works that
will debut this spring.
 &HT;    The acquisition trail hasnt always been pretty. A year and a
half ago, when Mission bought El Ranchito, a 50-year-old tortilla
factory in Zillah, Washington, the new Mexican owners closed the
plant two weeks before Christmas and let go all 80 employees, some
whose parents and grandparents had worked for the company. Gruma
then shifted production of the Ranchito brand to its facility in
nearby McMinnville, Oregon. It did the same thing last year in
Houston with its acquisition of La Predilecta. In both cases, the
owners were forced to sign multi-year non-compete agreements. Ricoy
defends the companys actions, saying the plants were old, with
outdated equipment.
 &HT;    With Grumas strong lead, Bimbo is fast trying to play catch up.
The $2.3 billion company has been exporting Mexico-made Tia Rosa
brand tortillas into Texas for years. But with its acquisition of
$300 million (1997 sales) Mrs Bairds, it is now the number-two
player in the Texas tortilla market with an 18 percent share
(versus 31 percent for Mission and 14 percent for Authentic
Speciality Foods). Along with the Bimbo and Tia Rosa brands of
tortillas, the firm now has Mrs Bairds and the C&AMP;C and San Marcos
labels in South Texas. It also has tortilla factories in California
and plans to move farther into the southern and southwestern United
States.
 &HT;    ``The United States represents a large potential market where
our company has been successful for the past 25 years,'' Juan
Muldoon, president of Bimbo Bakeries USA, the U.S. subsidiary for
Grupo Industrial Bimbo, said in a faxed response to questions from
Latin Trade. ``We definitely want to be a player in the industry.''
 &HT;    Bimbos expansion may be limited by its access to capital. In
June 1998, Bimbo had trouble lining up a syndicated bank loan to
buy Mrs Bairds because of the crumbling of emerging markets around
the world. It was forced to sweeten its terms, doubling its banking
fees and spread and shortening the grace period on repayment.
Muldoon says financing is up to its parent company. (Bimbo CEO
Daniel Servitje in Mexico City has said publicly that the company
would probably have to use borrowed funds for its expansion in the
United States.)
 &HT;    Money will be key, because Bimbo and Gruma face a tough
competitor in $6.3 billion Tyson Foods, the largest U.S. chicken
processor that has also become second-largest U.S. tortilla
producer. Tyson got into the business in 1983 by acquiring Mexican
Original, a popular Mexican restaurant in Fayetteville, Arkansas,
that had become a major supplier of tortillas to restaurants,
retailers and food distributors with sales of around $13 million.
Tyson expanded the company aggressively, opening up additional
plants in Fayetteville, Sanford, North Carolina, and Portland,
Indiana. The division now distributes tortillas to as far away as
New York City and has about $150 million in sales.
 &HT;    How does Tyson feel about Mexican titans like Gruma and Bimbo
moving in on its turf? ``Competition is competition,'' says Wayne
Beach, director of sales and marketing at Mexican Original. ``It
doesnt matter where it comes from.''
 &HT;    Another 800-pound gorilla that is moving in on the business is
$23 billion Con-Agra. The agricultural giant entered the business
six years ago when one of its major customers, Taco Bell, requested
it. It started with a plant in 1992 in Omaha, then acquired in May
1998 another tortilla maker, Louisville, Kentucky-based Mesa Foods.
With sales upwards of $50 million, Mesa Foods tortilla division,
Casa de Oro, is now scouting for more. ``Ten percent is pretty
heady growth for any food category,'' says Ted Longacre, Casa de
Oros president. ``So wed like to have a few more facilities.''
 &HT;    Longacre says Casa de Oro is trying to compete with the Mexican
giants on technology, trying to develop the best way to spit out
the best-tasting tortillas at the lowest cost. ``We have to figure
out how to win, both on the technology side and service to the
customer,'' he says.
 &HT;    With the competition getting stiff, Mexicos Desc is already
thinking about getting out of the U.S. tortilla business. At press
time, Authentic Specialty Foods was looking for a buyer for its $26
million (sales) tortilla division, which includes Calidad in
Dallas, La Monita in Houston and Tortilla King in San Antonio.
Mission Foods is the most likely suitor. ``The market is huge, and
so is its potential,'' says Francisco Hernandez, president of the
Texas direct sales division of Authentic Speciality Foods. ``But
its not our core business.''
 &HT;    The Tortilla Industry Associations Steinberg thinks
consolidation will continue, with smaller tortilla companies
getting swallowed up by bigger Mexican outfits like Bimbo and
Gruma. ``A lot of companies are opting to take the money and leave
and not try to compete,'' he says. ``Well eventually see 20 percent
of the players control 80 percent of the market.''
 &HT;    That doesnt frighten La Espiga de Oros Lira, who thinks he can
make a better product and provide better service than the tortilla
giants. ``Somebody (another tortilla company owner) told me, Bimbo
and Mission are like elephants, and we are like ants,'' Lira says.
``But I can bet money that more ants eat elephants than elephants
eat ants.'' Yes, unless the elephants stomp on the ants first.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The most depressing local sports story of
the past 12 months wasn't, as it turns out, the Mavericks'
wanderings, or the Cowboys in the playoffs, or even the fact that
both Randy Johnson and Roger Clemens wouldn't mess with Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It came Tuesday, when the news came that pitcher Kerry Wood
would have to undergo major reconstructive elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   They call it ``Tommy John surgery,'' after the Dodger whose
reconstructed pitching wing revolutionized modern sports medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry Wood has about as much in common with Tommy John as a
bullwhip does to a butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   The news is awful. The outlook is historically bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, the Grand Prairie High graduate and National League rookie
of the year, won't be back until the 2000 season at the earliest.
And even then, the question remains, will we recognize him?
</P>
<P>
   When Wood says, as he did at a news conference, ``It all depends
on the individual and on his work ethic,'' he suggests that he
plans an aggressive rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There've been cases where a guy has come back stronger, and
there've been cases when a guy hasn't come back as strong,'' Wood
said. ``The doctors do the surgery, and then it all depends on the
athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Another pitcher, Jose Rijo, thought he could come back from
``Tommy John surgery'' in the spring following his 1995 operation.
His elbow balked again, and the Cincinnati Reds' four-year,
$22-million investment proved a bust.
</P>
<P>
   Success after ``Tommy John surgery,'' the medical journals tell
us, is relative. Power pitchers, like Wood, often have to learn to
become finesse pitchers, like John.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Wood, a finesse pitcher? Sigh. What awful news.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it depends.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Tom Candiotti had the surgery, and he has flutter-balled
his way to 147 wins in his big-league career. The White Sox' Scott
Eyre, on the other hand, had his elbow reconstructed in 1994 and
has won but seven.
</P>
<P>
   There are ominous question marks lingering over the
once-so-bright careers of, among others, Cal Eldred, Butch Henry,
Steve Karsay and Jeremi Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Wood is only 21 years old. Even with a lengthy and complicated
rehab, he could be only 24 when he returns. That's not too old to
learn how to pitch again.
</P>
<P>
   But will we recognize him?
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' Darren Dreifort took the advice of noted surgeon
Dr. Frank Jobe, the man who invented the procedure, and had his
elbow redone in March, 1995. Dreifort was 22. The surgery cost him
most of two seasons, but he is back throwing in the mid-90 mph
range and has become a valued Dodger starter.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said, ``If it was going to happen, it was going to happen.
It was inevitable, I guess. I felt that way from the time my
velocity picked up _ I felt it could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Wood, the doctors will tell you, is a victim of the
system. High school teen-agers don't get drafted by relying on the
proverbial crafty assortment of change-ups and curveballs. If you
can't make a radar gun hum, you won't be drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Wood becomes the new poster child for Overthrowers Anonymous. It
was ``inevitable''?
</P>
<P>
   That's not pitching. That's self-abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Much will be made of Wood's pitching delivery and its alleged
flaws and the fact that Kerry had a tendency to throw across his
body. Let me suggest, however, that there are healthy pitchers in
every spring camp who throw across their bodies. Oakland's Kenny
Rogers, to name one.
</P>
<P>
   Wood overthrew because that's the only way he knows how to
pitch. His rehab, therefore, could end up being not only to his
elbow but between his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch, on the other hand, refused to change. The No. 4
overall pick in the 1996 draft, Koch was a 100-mph fireballer in
the Toronto chain when his elbow blew out in 1997. Anybody who has
ever seen Koch pitch _ either at Clemson or on the U.S. Olympic
team _ remembers him.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told Koch that he would be out for 18 months; he
returned in nine. He immediately began throwing 95 mph in spring
training and ended up starting 27 games in the minors last season.
Koch is a hot prospect again.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe was 48 years old and had a pioneer's vision, when he took a
tendon out of John's right arm and implanted it in the left in
1974. John returned to the mound two years later, pitched 14 more
big-league seasons and can still throw batting practice, he says,
for his son's school team.
</P>
<P>
   But Wood was special. In baseball's greatest summer, he struck
out 20 Houston Astros in one game and vaulted onto the marquee as a
featured player.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to envision Kerry Wood as anything other than a
hard-throwing 20-year-old, helping to pitch the Cubs into the NL
playoffs. It's hard to imagine Wood as anything but the way he was
in the summer of '98.
</P>
<P>
   Cherish that memory. Sadly, history suggests it may be all we
have.

 Por CLAIRE POOLE 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ Cuando en 1977 Alfredo Lira inauguro su negocio de
tortillas mexicanas en Houston, no tenia un centavo. Todo lo que
tenia era una destartalada planta de procesamiento de pollos y
varios equipos usados para hacer tortillas que eran de su cunado.
Pero con la ayuda de varios amigos y trabajando duro, convirtio La
Espiga de Oro en uno de los mayores fabricantes de tortilla
mexicana en la region. Sus tortillas incluso han servido de
alimento a los astronautas de la NASA.
 &HT;    Pero cuando empresas mexicanas de alimentos como Gruma y Grupo
Industrial Bimbo le propusieron comprarle el negocio, el empresario
de 54 anos se nego. ``Todavia no estoy dispuesto a retirarme,''
afirma.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, a diferencia de Lira, muchas tortillerias en
Estados Unidos aceptan la compra, en vez de quedar aplastadas por
las grandes empresas mexicanas del sector.
 &HT;    Mercado apetitoso. En los ultimos 10 anos, Gruma, a traves de su
filial estadounidense, Mission Foods, se ha dedicado a comprar
fabricas de tortilla desde Texas hasta Washington. Bimbo salto a la
palestra hace cinco anos: primero compro fabricas en Oklahoma City
y Toledo, Ohio, y luego adquirio Mrs Bairds Bakeries en marzo de
1998, por un precio no revelado. Y en junio de 1998, Agrobios, del
conglomerado mexicano Desc, pago US$142 millones por Authentic
Specialty Foods, Inc., propietaria de la linea Victoria de salsas,
chiles (pimientos) y otros productos mexicanos, y tres fabricantes
de tortilla en Texas.
 &HT;    Lo apetitoso del mercado de las tortillas de Estados Unidos es
su crecimiento. Segun la Asociacion de la Industria de la Tortilla
(TIA) de Estados Unidos, las ventas del producto han crecido de
US$300 millones en 1980 a mas de US$3.000 millones en 1998. En los
ultimos 15 anos, las ventas han crecido a un ritmo anual del 10 por
ciento anual y deben llegar a US$4.000 millones al ano para el
2000.
 &HT;    A que se debe este crecimiento? El aumento de la poblacion
mexicana en Estados Unidos (un 40 por ciento desde 1990, a casi 19
millones) es la razon mas obvia. Pero la mayor demanda de tortilla
mexicana proviene de los no hispanos, que consumen casi el 60 por
ciento de las ventas en Estados Unidos. No solo Taco Bell, sino
cadenas de servicio rapido que no se especializan en tacos, como
Long John Silvers y Subway, sirven tortillas mexicanas. ``En la
cultura no hispanica se ha descubierto que la tortilla es un buen
pan,'' dice Irwin Steinberg, presidente de la TIA, que tiene unos
150 afiliados. ``Es relativamente barata y muy saludable en
comparacion con otros panes.''
 &HT;    Aunque en Mexico ya se comia tortilla miles de anos antes de
Cristo, nunca han sido un gran negocio en ese pais. Durante muchos
anos, el gobierno mantuvo un control estricto de los precios, por
lo que las empresas siguieron a los emigrantes rumbo norte para
aprovechar la demanda de comida mexicana y la posibilidad de cobrar
mas por una bolsa de tortillas, entre 55 y 60 centavos por casi
medio kilo, en vez de los 15 centavos que cuestan en Mexico.
 &HT;    El gobierno elimino recientemente el control del precio, pero el
sector aun no genera muchas ganancias. Cuando los consumidores
mexicanos protestaron por el alza de precios, los fabricantes
acordaron limitarlo a unos 20 centavos el medio kilo, con una
reduccion de los margenes de ganancia. Y a pesar de la comodidad de
comprar tortillas empaquetadas en el supermercado, los mexicanos
prefieren comprarlas frescas en las tortillerias.
 &HT;    De modo que para las grandes empresas mexicanas, el mercado mas
importante de las tortillas empaquetadas es Estados Unidos. ``En
estos momentos toda empresa de Mexico quiere ganancias en
dolares,'' dice William Landers, especialista de Lehman Brothers en
Nueva York. ``Y la comida mexicana es la mas popular.''
 &HT;    A traves de Mission Foods, Gruma es probablemente la empresa con
mas antiguedad y fuerza en el mercado estadounidense. Desde que
entro al pais a fines de los anos 70, ha construido o adquirido 13
fabricas en ocho estados. Gruma, cuyas ventas en EU representan
casi la mitad de sus ventas anuales de US$1.300 millones, controla
la mayor parte del mercado estadounidense de tortillas con un 24
por ciento, seguida por Tyson Foods con el 5 por ciento y ConAgra y
Bimbo con el 3 por ciento cada una.
 &HT;    Aun quedan bolsones a donde Mission no llega, como los estados
centrales y parte de la costa Este. Por eso Martin Ricoy, que
dirigio Kaiser-Roth, la filial estadounidense del fabricante
mexicano de medias Synkro, antes de ocupar el cargo de presidente
ejecutivo de Mission hace dos anos, busca nuevos objetivos.
``Nuestra estrategia es crecer internamente, pero tambien a traves
de adquisiciones,'' dice Ricoy, que nacio en la Ciudad de Mexico
hace 50 anos. ``No sabemos si debemos ser la empresa dominante.
Pero si queremos ser la mayor.''
 &HT;    El 80 por ciento de los US$600 millones en ventas de Mission
Foods proviene de cadenas de supermercados; el resto procede de
negocios de servicio de alimentos como la cadena de restaurantes de
servicio rapido Taco Bell y la empresa de bocadillos salados
Frito-Lay. Esa es una esfera mas lucrativa, actualmente dominada
por Tyson, que a Ricoy le gustaria desarrollar mas. ``El servicio
de alimentos es un area en la que todavia no tenemos una
participacion adecuada, asi que vamos a empenarnos en conseguir esa
participacion.''
 &HT;    Absorciones a la mexicana. El ano pasado Mission fortalecio su
presencia, al punto de colocar anuncios de TV en ciertos mercados.
En su ultimo anuncio, que se transmitio recientemente en el costoso
espacio de la hora de mayor sintonia en la filial de la CBS en
Houston, se ve a una ocupada familia norteamericana en la cocina de
su casa. ``Envuelvalo. Enrollelo. Hagalo con Tortillas Mission,''
dice el locutor. Esta primavera se estrenaran otros anuncios.
 &HT;    Las adquisiciones no siempre han sido faciles. Hace ano y medio,
cuando Mission compro El Ranchito, una fabrica de tortillas fundada
hace 50 anos en Zillah, Washington, los nuevos duenos mexicanos
cerraron la planta dos semanas antes de la Navidad y dejaron
cesantes a los 80 empleados. Gruma traslado la produccion de la
marca Ranchito a su fabrica en McMinnville, Oregon. Lo mismo hizo
el ano pasado en Houston al adquirir La Predilecta. En ambos casos,
los duenos se vieron obligados a firmar convenios de no competir
por varios anos. Ricoy defiende las acciones de la empresa alegando
que las fabricas eran viejas y que sus equipos eran anticuados.
 &HT;    Gruma tiene una gran ventaja, y Bimbo trata de pisarle los
talones. La empresa de US$2.300 millones lleva anos exportando a
Texas las tortillas mexicanas marca Tia Rosa. Pero con su
adquisicion de Mrs Bairds (con ventas de US$300 millones en 1997),
ahora ocupa el segundo lugar en el mercado tejano de las tortillas,
con una participacion del 18 por ciento (frente al 31 por ciento de
Mission y el 14 por ciento de Authentic Specialty Foods). Junto con
las marcas Bimbo y Tia Rosa, la firma ahora tiene las de Mrs
Bairds, C&AMP;C y San Marcos en el sur de Texas. Tambien tiene fabricas
de tortilla en California y planea extenderse hacia el sur y el
suroeste de Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    ``Estados Unidos representa un gran mercado donde nuestra
empresa ha tenido exito en los ultimos 25 anos,'' dijo Juan
Muldoon, presidente de Bimbo Bakeries USA, la filial estadounidense
del Grupo Industrial Bimbo, en declaraciones a Latin Trade.
``Queremos tener un papel importante en el sector.''
 &HT;    La expansion de Bimbo puede verse limitada por su acceso al
capital. En junio de 1998, Bimbo afronto problemas al pedir un
prestamo sindicado para comprar Mrs Bairds debido a la caida de los
mercados eergentes a nivel mundial. Bimbo tuvo que suavizar sus
terminos, duplicar sus cuotas bancarias y abreviar el periodo de
gracia de los pagos. Muldoon dice que el financiamiento esta en
manos de su empresa matriz. (Daniel Servitje, presidente ejecutivo
de Bimbo en la Ciudad de Mexico, ha dicho publicamente que la
compania probablemente tenga que usar fondos prestados para su
expansion en Estados Unidos).
 &HT;    El dinero sera la clave porque Bimbo y Gruma tienen un fuerte
rival: Tyson Foods, con un capital de US$6.300 millones, el mayor
procesador de pollos de Estados Unidos que tambien se ha convertido
en el segundo productor de tortillas del pais. Tyson entro en el
negocio en 1983 al adquirir Mexican Original, un popular
restaurante mexicano en Fayetteville, Arkansas, que se habia
convertido en un importante abastecedor de tortillas a
restaurantes, minoristas y distribuidores de alimentos, con ventas
de aproximadamente US$13 millones. Tyson expandio la empresa con
gran dinamismo y abrio fabricas en Fayetteville, Sanford, en
Carolina del Norte, y Portland, en Indiana. La division distribuye
tortillas hasta Nueva York y tiene unos US$150 millones en ventas.
 &HT;    Cual es la opinion de Tyson sobre la irrupcion en su territorio
de colosos mexicanos como Gruma y Bimbo? ``La competencia es la
competencia,'' dice Wayne Beach, director de ventas y mercadeo de
Mexican Original. ``No importa de donde venga.''
 &HT;    Otro gigante que ha saltado a la palestra es ConAgra, con un
capital de US$23.000 millones. El coloso agricola entro en el
negocio hace seis anos cuando uno de sus principales clientes, Taco
Bell, se lo pidio. Comenzo con una planta en Omaha, en 1992, y en
mayo de 1998 adquirio otro fabricante de tortillas, Mesa Foods, de
Louisville, Kentucky. Con ventas de mas de US$50 millones, la
division de tortillas de Mesa Foods, Casa de Oro, busca mas. ``Un
crecimiento del 10 por ciento es muy vigoroso en cualquier
categoria alimentaria,'' senala Ted Longacre, presidente de Casa de
Oro. ``Asi que nos gustaria tener mas plantas.''
 &HT;    Longacre dice que Casa de Oro trata de competir con los gigantes
mexicanos en tecnologia, tratando de desarrollar la mejor forma de
producir las tortillas mas sabrosas al menor costo posible.
``Tenemos que determinar como vamos a ganar, tanto en el aspecto de
la tecnologia como en el servicio al cliente,'' dice.
 &HT;    Ante una competencia mas renida, Desc, de Mexico, ya considera
retirarse del negocio de la tortilla en Estados Unidos. Al cierre
de esta edicion, Authentic Specialty Foods buscaba un comprador
para su division de tortillas (con ventas de US$26 millones), que
tiene a Calidad en Dallas, La Monita en Houston y Tortilla King en
San Antonio. Mission Foods es el que tiene mas probabilidades de
comprar. ``El mercado es enorme, y tambien su potencial,'' senala
Francisco Hernandez, presidente de la division de ventas directas
en Texas de Authentic Specialty Foods. ``Pero no es nuestro negocio
esencial.''
 &HT;    Steinberg, de la Asociacion de la Industria de la Tortilla,
piensa que la consolidacion continuara y que las grandes empresas
mexicanas como Bimbo y Gruma devoraran a las companias pequenas.
``Muchas empresas optan por no competir, tomar el dinero y salir
del negocio,'' apunta. ``Al final el 20 por ciento de las empresas
controlara el 80 por ciento del mercado.''
 &HT;    Eso no asusta a Lira, de La Espiga de Oro, que opina que puede
hacer un producto mejor y dar un servicio mejor que los gigantes de
la tortilla. ``Alguien (otro propietario de una empresa de
tortillas me dijo: Bimbo y Mission son como elefantes, y nosotros
somos hormigas,'' relata Lira. ``Pero apuesto que son mas las
hormigas que comen elefantes que los elefantes que comen
hormigas.'' Eso es cierto, a menos que los elefantes aplasten
primero a las hormigas.

U.S. INQUIRY OF NYC POLICE EXPANDS TO INCLUDE ELITE STREET CRIMES
UNIT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A continuing investigation by federal prosecutors
into the tactics of the New York City Police Department will be
expanded to give increased scrutiny to the Street Crimes Unit, the
elite squad that includes four officers who fatally shot Amadou
Diallo, the Justice Department announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry, to be conducted by Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney
in Manhattan, will focus on whether members of the Street Crimes
Unit have systematically deprived people of their constitutional
rights through ``stop and frisk'' tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White's inquiry will broaden an investigation by the U.S.
attorney's office in Brooklyn, which began 18 months ago after the
alleged police torture of a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   City officials were formally notified of the expanded
investigation earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, state Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer said he
would review assertions that officers routinely stop people on the
streets and frisk them without justification. Earlier this month
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said it would hold hearings on
the police.
</P>
<P>
   The Street Crimes Unit sends teams of officers into
neighborhoods to hunt down suspects and seize illegal guns. It has
been criticized by civil rights groups who contend that its members
have stopped and searched tens of thousands of people, based on
their race, without arresting the vast majority of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White's investigation is likely to focus on the unit's
stop-and-frisk policies, as well as on the screening and training
of officers.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a spokeswoman for Police Commissioner Howard
Safir, said on Thursday night: ``We will fully cooperate with this
investigation, just as we have with all of the other
investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department portrayed Ms. White's focus on the Street
Crimes Unit Thursday night as an expansion of the original
investigation authorized by the agency under a 1994 law that allows
federal officials to investigate whether ``patterns or practices''
in police departments deprive people of civil rights.

GONZAGA TAKES BITE OUT OF FLORIDA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Gonzaga Bulldogs continued their improbable,
history-making run in the NCAA Tournament. They got a game-high
five 3-pointers from Richie Frahm and a Casey Calvary tip-in with
4.4 seconds remaining to defeat Florida, 73-72, in a West Regional
semifinal game last night at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga, a small school in Spokane, Wash., became the first No.
10 seed to advance to a regional final since Temple in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest moment in our basketball lives,'' Gonzaga
coach Dan Monson said. ``The only thing that could be sweeter is if
we make it to the Final Four. We've still got to come back and play
Saturday. But we're 40 minutes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga hit nearly as many 3-pointers (12) as 2-pointers (13).
They had leads of seven and 13. But with 45.7 seconds to go, they
were down, 72-69, after Florida center Greg Stolt hit his fourth
3-pointer of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Florida swarmed Frahm, who passed out of a double team to hit
Jeremy Eaton for a layup with 19.7 seconds left. On the inbounds
pass, Gonzaga guard Quentin Hall pressured Brent Wright into a
traveling call. That set up the winning basket. Hall's runner in
the lane was put back by Calvary, who outdueled Wright to give
Gonzaga the victory in a game that had eight lead changes and six
ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had both hands on the ball, and the ball bounced around and
went in,'' Calvary said. ``I was nervous to get the shot off. The
last time I made a game-winning shot must have come when I was the
third or fourth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida had one good chance at victory following Calvary's shot.
Guard Eddie Shannon ran the length of the court, but his
desperation, off-balance three-pointer rimmed out at the buzzer,
sending the sixth-seeded Gators home.
</P>
<P>
   A despondent Shannon lay on the court for several moments. Just
a few feet away, jubilant Gonzaga players celebrated in a heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were unlucky; they were lucky,'' said Florida guard Teddy
Dupay. ``We should have gone further. We had the game won. This is

   Frahm led all scorers with 17 points. He was 5 of 8 from the
3-point line, and hit three consecutive three-pointers in a 2:15

Santangelo added 11 points and seven assists.

   Stolt led the Gators with 16, and Wright had 15. But they were

making one of their first 13 3-pointers.
