DUI (Phoenix) Hundreds of drunken driving cases throughout Arizona
could be dismissed because prosecutors and crime lab technicians
allegedly concealed evidence from breath-testing equipment. Dubbed
``Data Dump'' by defense lawyers, the controversy already has
caused judges in Phoenix and Tempe to suppress Intoxilyzer results,
forcing prosecutors to dismiss charges. In a series of recent court
hearings and depositions, lab technicians for the Phoenix Police
Department and the Department of Public Service acknowledged that
quality assurance test errors are routinely deleted from a computer
that provides information to defense lawyers. By DENNIS WAGNER.

WRECKCHASER (undated) It's not like anyone would remember the
lonely young war bride from Scotland who put a gun to her head in a
Mesa, Ariz., motel room and tragically pulled the trigger. After
all, it's been 54 years since the June 29, 1945, day when Henrietta
Ellis took her own life hours after learning that her husband's
B-24 Liberator crashed in the rugged Arizona desert. Trey Brandt,
however, can't get her out of his mind. Two months ago, while
exploring the 1945 crash site, he found her husband's dog tag
imbedded in the dirt. ``It's really sad what happened to her,''
said Brandt, a 29-year-old beverage salesman whose passion is
tracking down long-forgotten wrecks of World War II military
aircraft. ``It's really sad.'' Bill Rummer, operations director at
Champlin Fighter Museum in Mesa, said that Arizona was a prime
training location for ``everything from basic flight training to
advanced bomber training.'' By LINDA HELSER. Story will move in the

BUDROYALE HAS TRAINER IN DRIVER'S SEAT

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Rags-to-riches gelding Budroyale's game
second in Sunday's Hollywood Gold Cup felt almost like a triumph to
adoring owner Jeffrey Sengara.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be any prouder if he'd won by 10 (lengths),'' the
Vancouver lumber businessman said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old California-bred picked up $200,000, pushing his
earnings over $892,000 since Sengara claimed him for $50,000 in
February 1998 and over $1.1 million for his 40-race career.
</P>
<P>
   Sengara had promised trainer Ted West Jr. a car if Budroyale
broke the $1 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to ask him which (car) he wants,'' Sengara said.
``Which one I give him is another situation entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   Record run: The performance of the day was turned in not by Real
Quiet but by 4-year-old sprinter Mazel Trick, who shattered the
Hollywood Park record for 7 furlongs in winning the Triple Bend
Handicap by five lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying Chris McCarron and 115 pounds, Mazel Trick rallied from
sixth on the outside and was clocked in 1:19 4/5, cutting
three-fifths of a second off the record shared by Memo, Hal's Pal,
Another Star and A.P. Assay.
</P>
<P>
   A faster 7 furlongs has been run at Hollywood Park _ Rich
Cream's American-record 1:19 2/5 in 1980 _ but that was before the
oval was reconfigured and the track statistics-keeping started
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised the police weren't there to give him a
speeding ticket,'' said Alex Solis, who rode favored Regal Thunder
to third place.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Frankel-trained Mazel Trick, a French import, hadn't raced
since having bone chips surgically removed from both front ankles
in December.
</P>
<P>
   The day's other stakes, the A Gleam Handicap for fillies and
mares, went to Enjoy the Moment and David Flores.
</P>
<P>
   Bad breaks: Emile Ramsammy, fourth in the Hollywood Park jockey
standings, fractured his right collarbone and possibly his left
knee in a fall at Woodbine racecourse near Toronto on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred in a race following the classic Queen's
Plate Stakes, in which Ramsammy and Frankel-trained Euchre ran
third to Woodcarver and Mickey Walls.

CLINTON TO UNVEIL PLAN TO SHORE UP SOCIAL SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON with ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to capitalize on new projections showing
that the federal budget surplus will grow far bigger than
anticipated, President Clinton plans to unveil sweeping new
proposals on Monday to allocate the windfall among Social Security,
Medicare and other spending and tax cut proposals, Democrats said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan is sure to renew and intensify his long-running
battle with Republicans in Congress over the nation's priorities as
it enters a new era in which the two parties must divide up pots of
money far larger than anything they could have imagined even a year
or two ago.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said new projections by the White House's Office of
Management and Budget showed that the total budget surplus would be
$179 billion higher over the next 5 years, and $517 billion higher
over 10 years, than its last estimates, in January.
</P>
<P>
   The White House wants to use much of the money on revised
approaches to shoring up the two big entitlement programs, Social
Security and Medicare, both of which will face serious financial
problems in coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   Under his new plan, Clinton will say that Social Security can be
put on sound footing until 2053, nearly two decades beyond the
point it will run into trouble if nothing is done. And he will call
for Medicare to get enough new financing to keep it solvent until
2027, an improvement of about a decade beyond current predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that with so much extra money now on the table _
the new projections show about $1 trillion available over the next
decade even without including excess Social Security revenues that
have swelled surplus figures in recent years _ Clinton will open
the door to a sizable tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Clinton had insisted that he would agree to a tax cut
only after Social Security's finances had been made stable for at
least 75 years, the actuarial benchmark for the retirement system's
solvency. His new approach implies that he would be willing to
consider a tax cut even if Social Security's solvency is not
guaranteed for that long.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats said Clinton intended to demand that
Republicans accede to his approach to Social Security and Medicare
before considering tax cuts or allowing any substantial increase in
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are already calling for a tax cut of $775 billion
over the next decade, and the new surplus figures are certain to
make them more determined to return more money to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is considerable pent-up demand for additional spending
within both parties, for purposes as varied as the military,
transportation, education and health.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, will not call for a removal of the tight
spending limits imposed on Congress by the bipartisan 1997 balanced
budget agreement, Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants his main tax-cut proposal, to provide
incentives for retirement savings to low- and middle-income
families, to get priority over Republican calls for tax-rate
reductions, reduced capital gains taxes, cuts in the estate tax and
other tax cuts at the top of the Republican wish list.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials declined to provide details of the budget
plan, which Clinton is scheduled to unveil early on Monday before
leaving on a fund-raising trip. Clinton is scheduled to unveil a
separate proposal on Tuesday for overhauling Medicare, the health
insurance system for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But people who had been briefed on the White House plan said
Clinton would propose that starting in 2011, general tax revenues
be diverted to Social Security to help shore up the system as the
baby boom generation begins retiring in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   So robust is the expected flow of revenue into the Treasury
under the new White House proposals that by 2015, the government
will have paid off the entire $3 trillion in national debt held by
the public, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In putting out a proposal on Monday, Clinton is trying to get a
step ahead of the Republican leadership, which will have a new set
of surplus estimates available from the Congressional Budget Office
in the middle of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's new plan includes a revised version of a proposal that
the two parties have been jockeying over in Congress for several
months: a ``lock box'' to insure that the excess Social Security
revenues are not spent, but used only to reduce the national debt
or to insure the retirement system's long-term viability.
</P>
<P>
   In his original budget proposal in January, Clinton proposed
reserving 62 percent of the budget surplus over 15 years for Social
Security, but in a way that would allow him to spend a portion of
the Social Security surplus in the next few years. Both parties
have rejected that approach, and although they differ on details,
have basically endorsed setting aside every dollar of each year's
Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said their new plan would respond to the
congressional criticism, and would also include a provision that
would link reducing the national debt to improving Social
Security's long-term financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The administration's original effort to do that in its January
budget was built around a complex proposal under which the benefits
of reducing the national debt would have been funneled to Social
Security in the form of new government bonds, an approach that
Republicans rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the new plan would try to reach
the same end by different means.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very hopeful that the new presidential proposal, that
new Social Security lock box, will be a way of bringing together
both Democrats and Republicans,'' Gene Sperling, the director of
the White House's National Economic Council, told CNN's ``Late
Edition'' on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of Clinton's ``Social Security first'' strategy,
the degree to which the two parties can agree on tax and spending
priorities seems largely to depend on whether they can make enough
progress on shoring up the retirement system to give them political
cover for using the surplus for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   With Republican efforts to pass spending bills in danger because
of the tight spending caps _ and with Clinton likely to veto the
$775 billion, 10-year tax cut they have in mind _ party leaders
have increasingly been banking on a budget windfall to help avoid
gridlock. House Speaker Dennis Hastert said last week that he
expected to promptly use any non-Social Security surpluses that
becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   But there are several different sets of ideas on what to do with
any windfall. Congressional Republicans will say it underlines the
good sense of tax cuts. Clinton indicated on Friday that he would
use the money as a way to help deal with both Medicare and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   But House Democrats openly, and many Republicans quietly, see
new good news on the budget as the only way out of a spending box
they built in 1997. Then, they set tight caps on the amount of
money Congress could spend on the military and on domestic programs
other than Social Security, Medicare, welfare and other so-called
entitlement programs.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike agreeing on tax cuts or Medicare and Social Security
legislation, passing annual spending bills is something Congress
really has to do; it is Hastert's first priority. Right now the
process is in a shambles, with only the smallest bills coming to
the House floor and the Senate considering none of them at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying problem is that the limits agreed to in 1997,
as some critics said at the time, are too low to maintain federal
programs at their current levels, making no additions except to
adjust for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Just to maintain domestic discretionary spending and allow for
inflation would require such spending to go to $299 billion in the
year beginning October 1, from $285 billion in the current year.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping defense spending level, except for inflation, would take
an increase to $268 billion, from $260 billion. And hardly anyone
wants to keep defense spending level, so under the overall caps,
the pinch on domestic spending is even tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Enforceable limits on federal spending, first enacted in 1990
and extended in 1993 and 1997, steadily applied the brakes to
growing deficits and were generally effective so long as balancing
the budget was a widely accepted goal.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the question is how to use surpluses, discipline in
pursuit of a more abstract kind of fiscal responsibility is less
attractive and harder to maintain.

DUI CASES AT RISK IN `DATA DUMP' CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Hundreds of drunken driving cases throughout Arizona
could be dismissed because prosecutors and crime lab technicians
allegedly concealed evidence from breath-testing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``Data Dump'' by defense lawyers, the controversy already
has caused judges in Phoenix and Tempe to suppress Intoxilyzer
results, forcing prosecutors to dismiss charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of recent court hearings and depositions, lab
technicians for the Phoenix Police Department and the Department of
Public Safety acknowledged that quality assurance test errors are
routinely deleted from a computer that provides information to
defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   And now attorneys statewide are swamping the courts with motions
alleging that DUI defendants have been denied due process by
authorities who intentionally hid data on breath-testing for the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important,'' said Clifford Girard, a Phoenix lawyer.
``There can literally be thousands of people convicted of
misdemeanor and felony offenses in DUI cases based on erroneous
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and lab experts claim that there has been no
wrongdoing and that the controversy is only a mass example of legal
maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing games with discovery,'' said Jerry Landau,
special assistant to Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley. ``And
we're not trying to hide anything from a defendant. . . . It's
basically the issue of the month (for DUI lawyers). Anyone can make
allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers almost universally agree that prosecutors
have violated ethical canons. And some contend there may be
criminal misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unquestionably, there are ethical problems with this,'' said
Craig Penrod. ``These are clearly public records. They're clearly
being destroyed. . . . And it's a Class 6 felony to tamper with a
public record.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Furlong, a Prescott lawyer, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they need to appoint a special investigator,'' Furlong
said. ``What about all those people who were convicted?''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy involves not only DUI defendants, but those
charged with felonies such as aggravated assault or manslaughter
because of charges that they were under the influence of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Penrod also said guilty defendants could get off on a
technicality caused by the government's conduct. And inmates
sentenced to prison because of prior DUI convictions may have
grounds to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Landau, who once supervised DUI prosecutions in Maricopa County,
denied that there have been any ethical or criminal violations. He
said drunken-driving defendants have received all relevant and
required evidence. And he expressed doubt that a huge number of DUI
cases will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   But Tempe Municipal Court Judge Mary Ann Majestic recently
ordered breath-test evidence suppressed for 15 defendants in a
single hearing. Majestic ruled that defendants were being subjected
to ``trial by machine,'' without an opportunity to present a full
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is this court's belief that this is a denial of fundamental
fairness, which is, and should be, shocking to the universal sense
of justice,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Penrod said a majority of the Tempe cases were later dropped by
the City Attorney's Office because it is difficult to win a
conviction without lab results.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy affects most courts statewide, except for Mesa,
Scottsdale and Tucson, where police do not use crime labs run by
the DPS or Phoenix police for blood-alcohol data storage.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, hundreds of dismissal motions have been filed in
Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're putting out these motions like water,'' Landau said.
``The court's being flooded with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chandler City Court, a single hearing scheduled today
involves motions in 98 DUI cases _ all concerning the breath-test
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Criminalists and prosecutors justified the deletion of quality
assurance test errors by saying that the ``error'' readings were
caused by flawed tests, rather than a problem with the
breath-testing machine itself.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that it would be misleading to release records
showing such errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a scientifically valid piece of information,'' said
Todd Griffith, DPS scientific analysis supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   But Chester Flaxmayer, a former DPS criminalist, that the flaws
could also be caused by faulty breath-test equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came as a shock to us because it does go to the integrity
of the system,'' said Girard, the Phoenix lawyer. ``They just want
to keep the system going, make the machine look good. And if people
get burned, too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involves a complicated mix of science and computers.
Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   A drunken-driving suspect submits a breath sample to the
Intoxilyzer 5000, which calculates blood-alcohol levels. Anyone
with a reading of 0.10 percent is presumed drunk and faces a
separate charge and immediate driver's license suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials conduct routine quality assurance
tests to verify that the machine is properly calibrated and in good
working order. Those tests, as well as actual breath-test results,
are stored in a DPS database known as ADAMS.
</P>
<P>
   The system is considered so accurate and foolproof that Arizona
defense attorneys are not entitled to backup breath samples for
independent evaluation. Instead, they are given printouts of
testing results.
</P>
<P>
   Those printouts come through Arizona's Criminal Justice
Information System, a computer linked to police agencies and
prosecutor offices statewide. For the past five years, defense
lawyers thought they were getting all the test data.
</P>
<P>
   Then Furlong, the Prescott lawyer, and two colleagues began
investigating. Defense attorneys discovered that crime lab workers
were actually asking police agencies which test results should be
deleted and that software had been installed to automatically erase
some test results.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most damaging revelations came in a 1997 memo
written by DPS criminalist Terry Hogan. That memo describes a
meeting with 10 Maricopa County prosecutors who were told of the
hidden test results and ``thought it would be no problem.'' It also
says they agreed to fight defense motions seeking the information.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, the DPS supervisor, said there is nothing nefarious
about those policies. He said flawed test results _ caused by power
surges or condensation, for example _ have no bearing on the
accuracy of breath tests.
</P>
<P>
   He and Hogan denied defense allegations that information was
concealed to prevent outside experts from challenging breath test
results.
</P>
<P>
   But defense attorneys say the lab techs and prosecutors knew
exactly what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's collusion _ a conspiratorial agreement,'' said Anthony
Zuniga, a Phoenix defense lawyer. ``That's unethical and
inappropriate.'' &QL;

WWII-ERA CRASHES LURE WRECK CHASER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA HELSER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not like anyone would remember the lonely young war bride
from Scotland who put a gun to her head in a Mesa motel room and
tragically pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's been 54 years since the June 29, 1945, day when
Henrietta Ellis took her own life hours after learning that her
husband's B-24 Liberator crashed in the rugged Arizona desert.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Brandt, however, can't get her out of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, while exploring the 1945 crash site, he found
her husband's dog tag imbedded in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really sad what happened to her,'' said Brandt, a
29-year-old beverage salesman whose passion is tracking down
long-forgotten wrecks of World War II military aircraft. ``It's
really sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandt learned of Henrietta's story after a paper trail led him
to the place where her husband, 2nd Lt. Hesler Ellis, died, about
7{ miles east of what is now Williams Gateway Airport in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a wreck chaser,'' Brandt said. ``Some people call us
aviation archaeologists but I prefer `wreck chasers,' and I spent
about six months in the library researching World War II military
aircraft crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Using vintage newspaper reports and U.S. Army Air Forces
accident records, Brandt determines generally vague crash locations
and then spends his weekends hiking to the remote areas in search
of the exact site and any remnants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys like to golf,'' Brandt said. ``I do this. It's just
my hobby, and it combines things I love like hiking and camping.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Scottsdale bachelor is wreck chasing in
Arizona, a state where he's not likely to run out of dig sites any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona became a major hub for training bases during World War
II because of its clear skies, open spaces and 365 days of sunshine
each year,'' he said. ``It was a great place for training.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rummer, operations director at Champlin Fighter Museum in
Mesa, said that Arizona was a prime training location for
``everything from basic flight training to advanced bomber
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the primary airfields Brandt said were utilized included
Kingman, Luke, Williams, Falcon, Thunderbird, Marana, Yuma,
Dateland, Davis-Monthan and Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   There were a great number of aviation accidents, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure there were easily 250 to 275 military air crashes
occurring within the state between 1941 and 1945,'' Brandt said.
</P>
<P>
   That number sounded plausible to Rummer, who added, ``Literally
tens of thousands of pilots cycled through Arizona during that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical aircraft lost during training missions included B-17s,
24s, 25s and 29s; P-38s, 39s, 40s and 51s; BT-13s and AT-6s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like basic trainers and small fighter planes,''
Brandt said.
</P>
<P>
   But during the war there was very little time and less money to
recover any mangled machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their main focus was flying and training and they had no
manpower or time to go haul off the wreckage,'' Brandt said. ``They
took away the bodies and any surviving bombs and guns.''
</P>
<P>
   And they left the rest for scavengers, who arrived on the scene
postwar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of those planes were removed in the 1950s and 1960s by
the military, Forest Service or aluminum scrappers,'' Brandt said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, however, only large hunks were worth the taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the very small pieces you'd never know were there until
you stumble upon them were left behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brandt, who's long been fascinated with World War II, isn't
always successful in locating the wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been up the wrong mountain more than once,'' he said,
``and sometimes I've looked for a wreck four, five, six times
before I found it.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, he never does find it. Out of the 70 he's
searched for in the past six years, he's managed to find 60.
</P>
<P>
   Once he does detect a site, however, Brandt tends to be
fortunate in his findings.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his discoveries include tarnished hat and cap badges,
medals, coins, engines, canopy doors, headphones and lots of bent
and twisted metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I find rings or dog tags I try to return them to a family
member,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he discovered Ellis' tag, he launched into a search for any
surviving family.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he found a death certificate and a short item in ``The
Phoenix Gazette'' newspaper briefly outlining how the childless
Henrietta was found in her motelroom, dying of a self-inflicted
bullet wound.
</P>
<P>
   Through another 1945 newspaper article, Brandt learned that
Ellis had been survived by an aunt who lived in Phoenix. Not only
was he able to track down the aunt's son, Calvin Brice, but also
Ellis' 99-year-old mother, Josephine Hoffman, who now resides in
Phoenix with Brice.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Brandt returned the long lost dog tag to Brice and
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been laying out there in the desert 55 years, so it shows
dog tags were made of pretty good metal,'' said Brice, who plans to
store the tag with other wartime mementos of his deceased cousin.
</P>
<P>
   But Brandt has more tags to return.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago he found one for a Frank T. Byrne, whose
hometown was New York City. Byrne, along with 18 others, perished
in a 1944 Christmas Day crash of a C-47, 15 miles southeast of
Quartzsite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be neat to find a home for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes less personal items he finds are donated to vintage
aircraft restorers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this guy was looking for a tail wheel,'' Brandt said.
``So when I found one I donated it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandt, however, isn't the only wreck chaser out there,
searching the mountains and flatlands of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   At least two others, veteran chasers Robert Kropp of Mesa and
Bob Lasher of Prescott, frequently search, sometimes joining forces
with Brandt.
</P>
<P>
   Even a Web site (members. aol.com/ariztrey/crash1.htm) has been
created by Brandt to discuss and exchange information on crash
sites. And currently, a California aviation archaeologist, Craig
Fuller, is compiling a book on Arizona settings of World War II
wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun part for me is to go out and hike around and try to
figure out how a plane hit or why it hit and how close it came to
making it over the peak,'' Brandt said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another aspect he would rather not dwell on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tragic to think that a lot of young lives ended out
there,'' Brandt said. ``A lot of those guys were like 18 to 20
years old, and they never had the chance to grow up and have
children.'' &QL;

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The road to the National League Central title may still go through
Houston, but if the past four days are any indication, it might not
be a bad idea to keep your eyes peeled for those exit signs marked
Cincinnati.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After being in the driver's seat for 57 consecutive days, the
Astros surrendered control to the Reds, who completed a four-game
sweep with a 5-2 victory Sunday at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this series was more like a carjacking. The Reds
pistol-whipped the Astros' pitchers and shot holes through their
hitters in a manner that was almost demoralizing. The Astros hit
.151 in the series and were outscored 26-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they (the Reds) were playing against the last-place
team in baseball,'' said Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell, whose
only hits in the series were a pair of home runs. ``Obviously,
we're disappointed; we have to play better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds pulled even with the Astros in the standings but are
actually ahead by a percentage point. The new NL Central leaders
have won nine of their last 11 games, including seven in a row. The
Astros tied their season-worst losing streak with their fourth
straight defeat, and they have dropped nine of their last 13 games,
losing six games in the standings in the span of a week.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep marks the Astros' first in a four-game series at home
since the Reds turned the trick in June 1995 en route to the NL
Championship Series. The Astros no doubt hope history isn't in the
process of repeating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is wrong, and we need to figure it out,'' said
Astros pitcher Jose Lima (11-4), who has lost two of his last three
starts and hasn't won since June 12. ``We're better than that, and
we need to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make any excuses or take anything away from
the Reds. Everything is going their way right now. They're doing
everything that you have to do to win games _ all of the little
things. Nothing is going our way right now, but I'll tell you one
thing: It's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The best sight the Astros saw all weekend was the Reds' team bus
heading for the airport. The Astros are off today, and they'll try
to change their luck beginning Tuesday when the Cardinals check in
for a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good time for an off day,'' Astros interim manager
Matt Galante said. ``We need to get away from the mental part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what appears to be a desperate situation, the Astros
insist they have not begun to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know what the word means,'' Galante said.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, the Astros are having trouble with the meaning of a
certain three-letter word: H-I-T. They were held to five hits or
fewer in three of the four games against the Reds, and they are
hitting .204 in their last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst we've played all year,'' said Astros third
baseman Bill Spiers, who was 0-for-13 in the series despite a .326
career batting average against the Reds. ``Hopefully, this is as
down as we'll get. They came in here on a high and really took it
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds right fielder Michael Tucker, who is hitting .429 with
eight RBIs in his last five games, greeted Lima with a solo home
run in the first inning. Lima retired six of the next eight batters
he faced, including five on strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's 24th homer, a solo shot into the loge level in left
field, tied the game in the fourth inning. But Reds starter Pete
Harnisch got all the support he needed in the sixth when Barry
Larkin and Eddie Taubensee stroked a couple of ground-ball singles
through the infield to account for all three runs in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lima gave us a chance to win the game,'' Galante said. ``We
just didn't get a very good offensive performance. Their pitching
just dominated us in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch (7-6) left after five innings, and Friendswood native
Scott Williamson blew the Astros away with a wicked assortment of
pitches in three perfect relief innings that included four
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got as good a bullpen as anyone,'' Galante said.
``Once you get into their bullpen when they've got a lead, it's
tough to get anything going.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett's ninth-inning home run off Danny Graves confirmed
the Astros' pulse, but by then the real damage already had been
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can get any hotter than they are now,''
Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said of the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe the Astros can't get any colder.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ According to how some interpret the prophecies
of Nostradamus, the world is going to end Sunday, having been laid
to waste by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. But it remains
unclear whether war, death, famine and plague will finish wreaking
their havoc at the behest of the King of Terror before, during or
after the men's final at Wimbledon. Nostradamus didn't give us a
time, just a rough date, presumed to be the first Sunday of July
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The foolhardy All England Club officials, however, seem thus far
disinclined to move the match up, playing the men as part of a
doubleheader with the women's final on Saturday, just to be on the
safe side. After all, Nostradamus appeared to have warned us about
the Great Fire of London, the French and Russian revolutions,
Hitler's rise to power, the Kennedy assassination and possibly the
Guf War, depending on how you decipher his admittedly ambiguous
prognostications.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon tends to believe it's above everything, though, rain
included. A pity, because the prospects for a Sampras-Agassi or
Sampras-Becker final are looming larger by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   For all the recent blather about ``girl power,'' about how the
women have gained the upper hand in tennis _ an apocalyptic notion
in its own right, according to those entrenched in their belief
they should compete for less prize money here _ the current
Wimbledon fortnight is now a bit of a throwback.
</P>
<P>
   There are nice stories on the ladies' side, but a preponderance
of the most compelling ones center on the blokes.
</P>
<P>
   Can Pete Sampras win a modern-day-record sixth title and thus
equal Roy Emerson's Grand Slam championship count of 12?
</P>
<P>
   Can Andre Agassi, born again as a contender, pull off the first
Roland Garros-Wimbledon double since Bjorn Borg's in 1980?
</P>
<P>
   Can Jim Courier, the forgotten American, shrug off the effects
of a bad cold, a case of severe dehydration and two five-set
first-week battles to reprise his run to the final in 1993?
</P>
<P>
   Can Todd Martin, the unsung American, join his aforementioned
mates in the Grand Slam club?
</P>
<P>
   Can Boris Becker, the erstwhile boy wonder who has come out of
semi-retirement for a last Wimbledon moment, pull off as amazing a
feat at 31 as the one he managed at 17?
</P>
<P>
   Can either Tim Henman or Greg Rusedski, England's pair of
long-ballyhooed, long-thwarted hopes, finally bring the title home
after a wait of more than six decades?
</P>
<P>
   Can Goran Ivanisevic, thrice the runner-up, end his personal
Centre Court agony?
</P>
<P>
   Can Patrick Rafter or Mark Philippoussis, two of Wimbledon's
most conspicuous underachievers, give back to the Australians the
championship that once seemed theirs by birthright?
</P>
<P>
   Can Gustavo Kuerten, the former French Open champ from Brazil
who still hasn't dropped a set, become the first resident South
American male (Alex Olmedo lived in California, not his native
Peru) to conquer the hallowed lawns?
</P>
<P>
   And one last question: Where's Nostradamus when you really need
an answer, when you'd like to lay a quid or two down on one of the
lads?
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Sampras gets past the Serb-turned-Canadian Daniel
Nestor in the fourth round _ and it's a safe assumption he will, no
matter how spotty his pre-Wimbledon play _ he'll face either
Rusedski or Philippoussis in the quarters, and likely either Henman
or Courier in the semis. No matter. He is the prohibitive favorite
until someone proves him otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Becker, the sentimental favorite for almost everyone except the
Henman-loving Brits, probably will have to go through Ivanisevic
and Agassi after Rafter to reach the final for the eighth time.
While his bid remains an improbable one, given that his third and
most recent championship came 10 years ago, only Sampras feels more
comfortable on Centre Court than Becker.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, the GQ cover boy who answers to ``Stinky'' around his
mates, has won two U.S. Opens in a row but heretofore has only
stunk things up at Wimbledon, never advancing beyond the fourth
round despite being as well-suited for these lawns as the Aussie
titans of lore.
</P>
<P>
   Most ill-suited, of course, would be Kuerten, a resolute
baseliner. But ``Guga'' can draw inspiration from Agassi, his next
obstacle if he survives Lorenzo Manta, a Swiss-Italian. Andre is
the decade's lone groundstroker to prevail at Wimbledon, having
begun Ivanisevic's enduring agony in the final of seven summers
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Goran, there's a reason to finally like his chances.
With his dark, haunting eyes, beard and flowing hair, he actually
bears a slight resemblance to the drawings we have of Nostradamus.
</P>
<P>
   Prophetic?

EMPTYING OUT CUP PRETENDERS

 CUP-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Now, the real World Cup begins. Now, the teams that
belong here get to play among their peers. Now, it's go on or go
home. Everybody else _ the Mexicans, the Japanese, the Ghanaians,
the Canadians and the rest of the no-hopers _ is already at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, there aren't 16 world-class women's soccer teams.
There are barely eight, which happens to be the size of the Olympic
field. So, as everyone predicted, there were some hilarious
first-round mismatches _ US 7, Nigeria 1 . . . Brazil 7, Mexico 1 .
. . China 7, Ghana 0 . . . Germany 6, Mexico 0 . . . Norway 7,
Canada 1 . . . Russia 5, Japan 0. This was women's ice hockey with
corner kicks.
</P>
<P>
   You could argue that FIFA, the international federation, was
dreaming when it expanded the Cup field from 12 to 16 this time.
You also could argue that FIFA was visionary. If the future of
football is feminine, as president Sepp Blatter says, more
countries need to be involved at the world level. If that means a
bunch of 7-1 laughers, such is the price of progress.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike men's soccer, which has been a mature global sport for at
least half a century, the women's game progresses quickly. The
Brazilians scored one goal in the 1991 Cup. This time, they won
their group and likely will play the Americans in the semifinals.
The North Koreans never had qualified for the tournament and rarely
play outside Asia. But they beat Denmark, should have drawn with
Nigeria, and hung with the Americans for more than an hour
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. Ghana tied Australia. The Italians drew with the
Germans. None of that would have happened four years ago. ``I said
there would be some lopsided matches, but I said there would also
be some upsets,'' said US coach Tony DiCicco.
</P>
<P>
   The learning curve at this level is painful but rapid. The
Mexicans, who cobbled a team together and qualified on a
shoestring, were hammered in their first two matches. But they held
the Italians to 2-0 here Sunday. ``It was like going from
kindergarten to the university level,'' concluded coach Leonardo
Cuellar. ``But we needed the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   They also needed a benchmark to take home with them to convince
their grudging federation that better organization and more money
are needed if the Mexicans want to get their women to anywhere near
where their men are.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot go to the World Cup without a national team,''
Cuellar said. ``You cannot go recruiting players from the streets
and bringing some from abroad. They must take care of the women's
program. We are going to demand that.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of countries _ the US, Norway, China, Germany, Sweden
_ have pumped resources into their women's teams for a decade or
more. The Australians, who are hosting both the 2000 Olympics and
the 2003 World Cup, have invested more than $1 million to make sure
the Matildas are respectable. But most countries consider the
women's game an amusing curiosity at best.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerians, who have played in all three Cups, still have to
fight old husbands' tales that playing soccer will keep women from
having babies. ``My girls are strong, but they need more
exposure,'' said coach Ismaila Mabo. ``When we get back to Nigeria
we will mount pressure on our government to see that we get more
for the next World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Americans and Norwegians and Chinese, the Cup is about
winning. For almost everybody else, it's about merely getting on
the radar screen back home. The Italians finished sixth in 1991,
didn't qualify last time, and vanished from sight. They had to get
back on the global stage to become visible again. ``At least back
home we've been getting coverage now,'' said coach Carlo Facchin.
</P>
<P>
   In England and the Netherlands, Argentina and Spain, where
soccer is considered a man's game, nobody cared when the women
didn't qualify. Across most of the world, that is normal. What is
not normal is what has been happening in the States for the past 10
days _ enthusiastic crowds of 79,000 and 65,000 and 50,000 paying
top dollar to watch females kick a ball around.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians and Australians and Ghanaians have been astounded
by what they've seen here. Not merely by the crowds and the
five-deep rows of autograph seekers and the extensive newspaper and
magazine coverage, but by the TV ads. Mia Hamm and Michael Jordan
portrayed as athletic and social equals sends a powerful message to
women who come from countries where basic rights for females, much
less a competitive soccer team, are still a distant dream.
</P>
<P>
   The countries that take women's soccer _ and by extension, women
_ seriously are still here playing. The rest are headed home to
preach the gospel to the unconverted. ``I'm hoping the Italians
will take a good example from this,'' forward Patrizia Panico said.

LA LOSES MINOR LEAGUERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unprecedented decision, Major League Baseball has stripped
the Los Angeles Dodgers of two promising minor leaguers who accused
the team of holding secret tryouts in Cuba and arranging the
players' defections in violation of major league rules.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Carlos Diaz, a first baseman, and outfielder Josue Perez
were informed Friday by their managers that they had been granted
free agency, the players said. Diaz and Perez had asked to be
released from their contracts, arguing that the Dodgers had denied
them the opportunity to obtain fair contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions, which have not been announced by baseball's
Commissioner's Office, also are believed to include a heavy fine
against the Dodgers for violating rules against scouting in Cuba.
It is unclear whether the club also violated a US trade embargo
that prohibits American companies from conducting business on the
Communist-ruled island.
</P>
<P>
   The Commissioner's Office was not available for comment Sunday.
In a release, the Dodgers said they would abide by the
Commissioner's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, who was hitting .303 with nine homers and 52 RBIs in 66
games at Double A San Antonio, and Perez, who was hitting .279 with
14 stolen bases at Single A Vero Beach, are now eligible to sign
with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just told the truth, and we were asking them to do what was
just, what was right,'' Perez said in a telephone interview. ``But
we have mixed feelings. We have a lot of friends with the
Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, which was first reported by the Globe last month,
marks the first time a team has been caught scouting in Cuba. It
also represents perhaps the most extraordinary scheme by a major
league club to tap into a goldmine of Cuban baseball talent that
remains largely hidden despite dozens of defections over the past
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   In separate incidents in 1996 and 1997, Pablo Peguero, a scout
who also heads the Dodgers' baseball academy in the Dominican
Republic, entered Cuba by posing as a tourist and made contact with
Diaz, Perez, and several other players he apparently was interested
in signing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Diaz, Peguero videotaped a secret tryout for him on
the outskirts of Havana in 1996. Perez said Peguero returned and
held a tryout for him in 1997. In both cases, the players said
Peguero then helped them obtain visas by having women _ in one case
the scout's cousin _ pose as their girlfriends. The women told
Cuban immigration authorities that they had invited the players to
visit the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Once Diaz and Perez were in the Dominican Republic, the women
disappeared, and the players were placed at the Dodger baseball
academy. With no prior negotiations, and without allowing the
players to be represented by an agent, Peguero signed the players _
Diaz for $65,000, Perez for $40,000 _ and told them they should
tell people they came to the Dominican Republic on their own if
they ever were asked about it.
</P>
<P>
   Gus Dominguez, the players' Los Angeles-based agent, said the
case was an indication of the heavy demand for Cuban players and
``lack of respect'' on the part of the Dodgers. ``They thought they
were bigger than baseball and they're not,'' Dominguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Peguero and Ralph Avila, a Dodgers senior vice president who was
involved in the signings, initially denied the charges. But the
Dodgers later released a statement saying they would cooperate with
an investigation by Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the team and its supporters argued that the players
should have been grateful for the Dodgers' assistance in getting
them out of Cuba. They noted that the players waited three years to
file the grievance, during which the demand for Cuban players has
continued to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz and Perez said they were interviewed by baseball
investigators for three hours about the incident. Although they
were notified Friday that they had been granted free agency, the
Dodgers apparently began to prepare for the decision as early as
last Wednesday, when they abruptly pulled Perez out of the Vero
Beach lineup. Diaz was pulled from the lineup the following day,
Dominguez said, and was told he could attend the game only as a
spectator.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the club told the players that they would be sent back
to the Dominican Republic. Perez said he was told that Dominguez
would be waiting there for him. When he called his agent, who was
holding tryouts for 11 other Cuban players in San Jose, Costa Rica,
he learned that he had been misled.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez put the players on a flight to Los Angeles, where they
are expected to attend a press conference early this week.

   SEATTLE _ As the building's unofficial mom, Carol Keaton, the
Kingdome media manager, has a favorite baseball story about her
concrete child.
</P>
<P>
   More than an hour after the Mariners defeated the Yankees in the
1995 American League Division Series, including the final one in
soul-sapping fashion, George Steinbrenner trudged solemnly out of
the Kingdome's visitor dugout onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   The bombastic Yankees owner, long contemptuous of Seattle
baseball and a leader in the fight against the Mariners'
Japanese-led ownership, encountered an acquaintance, Kingdome boss
Vern Wagner.

<P>
   Steinbrenner and his entourage paused as Wagner politely allowed
as to how the Yankees had had some good luck in the past, but ...
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building,'' he said gravely, ``killed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Ken Griffey Jr. Not Alex Rodriguez. Not Randy Johnson. Not
Edgar Martinez. Not even Jay Buhner, whom Steinbrenner handed to
the Mariners in his most knuckleheaded trade as Yankee strongman.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome doomed 'em. For the series' final three games, the
Yankees stood in the middle of an audio riot, nearly helpless and
all but defeated.
</P>
<P>
   While the players would be hard pressed to quantify just how
difficult was the task, when was the last time the recently
dynastic Yankees lost three straight postseason games?
</P>
<P>
   Renowned as a magnet for derision, yes, the Kingdome was also
the decibel's best friend; sufficient to make Steinbrenner, one of
the more reviled figures in American sport, eat local dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway has the Monster. Wrigley has the ivy. Yankee Stadium has
the monuments. The Kingdome had the reverb.
</P>
<P>
   Esthetically speaking, the other trademarks are preferable. But
for wins, take the noise and give the runs.
</P>
<P>
   Worked for the Minnesota Twins, world champions in 1987 and
1991. Their beauty-free yard, the Metrodome, was a large factor in
producing the last baseball title for a small-market team.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Mariner ownerships have never been as successful
in taking advantage of their park. Complaining, it seems, is much
easier than building a team that exploits the home field.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, the noise, fans and enthusiasm have been there.
As one playoff win in the last three seasons suggests, the talent
has not.
</P>
<P>
   But at least for a day, the final day, the imagination was
ignited again. The 40th and last sellout in the Kingdome turned
into an unlikely storybook fiesta of camera-flash baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching: Four innings of shutout relief!
</P>
<P>
   Fielding: Griffey reaches over the fence to save a three-run
home run!
</P>
<P>
   Hitting: Griffey hits a three-run home run!
</P>
<P>
   Running: Catcher Dan Wilson steals a base! A streaker briefly
steals the show!
</P>
<P>
   Griping: Edgar Martinez gets thrown out for arguing strikes!
</P>
<P>
   Winning: Mariners, 5-2!
</P>
<P>
   Please excuse the exclamation points, the last refuge of a
desperate writer. But when that many rare, even unique, Mariner
developments collide in front of a full house in farewell pucker,
well, writing ``gee whiz'' a dozen times gets a little busy.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a well-done post-game ceremony that featured Mariner
old-timers as well as the current heroes and Ken Griffey the Dad,
well, a standing O for the day was irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   For a franchise that has been stepping on rakes with remarkable
consistency lately, Sunday's celebration was welcome relief.
</P>
<P>
   The decibels came home, the fun was back, and the gee was whiz.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey was at the epicenter, accounting, with his catch and his
homer, for a six-run turnaround. Even when he struck out with the
bases loaded in the eighth inning, the tingle was better than 98
percent of the past NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the coolest thing for him about the whole day was the
fact that his dad was flown in from his coaching job with the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a baseball reunion of that day in 1990 when they took to
the Kingdome outfield, the first father and son tandem in major
league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something no one else has done,'' he said Sunday. ``It
means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey continues to do many things no one else is doing,
including increasing his mastery of theater. For the last of the
more than 32 million fans to witness Kingdome baseball, Griffey
launched the building's final homer, and made sure by denying the
opponent a checkmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great day for Junior,'' said manager Lou Piniella, ``and a
great day for fans at the Kingdome.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion of baseball's history at the Kingdome also made
the point that great theater doesn't need a great theater. What it
needs are good actors, rich with passion and commitment and wrapped
in history.
</P>
<P>
   For a day, the Mariners had it all, loudly.

M'S WANT MORE OFF-SPEED PITCHES FROM BULLPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ More than anything else, Stan Williams believes, the
problem with the Mariners bullpen has been a reluctance to throw
breaking pitches. Jose Paniagua and Jose Mesa have fastballs in the
mid-90s, but they need more than that to get by.
</P>
<P>
   ``This league hits fastballs,'' said Williams, the Mariners'
pitching coach. ``If they come in and get behind with the fastball,
then they have one thing to go to _ the fastball. Hitters can turn
it up a notch and sit on it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's game, when Paniagua allowed a three-run,
game-tying double to the Rangers' Roberto Kelly, Williams spoke to
Paniagua about throwing more breaking pitches, mimicking various
grips as he talked.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua said he has been giving up too many hits off his
slider, but pledged to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to throw more inside, more breaking balls,'' Paniagua
said. ``That's what (manager) Lou (Piniella) asked me. More
split-fingers, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, he was using his split-finger more effectively,''
Williams said. ``This year, he'll throw one warming up and bounces
it, so he quits on it. We're trying to get it back so he uses it in
ballgames, along with his slider. They're both excellent pitches
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa also had gotten away from off-speed pitches, but used more
in Saturday's save, getting a check-swing groundout on a slider the
Rangers weren't expecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to mix it up, off-speed and fastball,'' Mesa
said after saving Sunday's game. ``If you use just fastballs, no
matter how hard you throw it, they still can hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   STARS AND STARTERS: Left-hander Jamie Moyer is on schedule to
start the opening game at Safeco Field July 15, but that could
change if Moyer is selected for the All-Star Game _ ``which he
deserves to be,'' said Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   Both Moyer and Freddy Garcia will be rested if chosen for the
game in Boston on July 13. Moyer makes his last start July 7 in
Anaheim, Garcia July 9 in Los Angeles. If Moyer is selected and
pitches in Boston, Garcia would be the likely Safeco starter.
</P>
<P>
   If Piniella has any say, both Moyer and Garcia will make the
All-Star team. Each year the American League asks managers to pick
an All-Star pitching staff, with the results weighing heavily in
the league's selection process. Among Piniella's choices: Garcia,
Moyer and standout rookies Jeff Weaver of the Detroit Tigers and
Jim Parque of the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   THUMB FOR EDGAR: One unlikely ``last'' at the Kingdome was the
last ejection _ mild-mannered designated hitter Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was thrown out by home plate umpire Brian O'Nora, who
earlier had tossed Texas manager Johnny Oates and shortstop Royce
Clayton. Martinez was upset after striking out in the seventh
inning on a pitch he said M's pitchers had not been getting for
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK if it's for everybody,'' Martinez said. ``I would
have no objection. But when you see the other guy getting them and
not your own guy _ I didn't mean to insult him, but I just really
wanted to let him know.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, whose only previous ejection came at Boston on Aug.
23, 1996, said he told O'Nora, ``Just call it the same both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   MINOR MOVES: The Mariners sent 19-year-old left-hander Andrew
VanHekken to the Detroit Tigers Sunday as one of the two players to
be named later in the trade that brought outfielder Brian Hunter to
Seattle. VanHekken, a native of Holland, Mich., was 6-3 with a 4.43
earned run average at rookie league Peoria last year. He was the
M's third-round choice in the 1998 draft.
</P>
<P>
   While VanHekken was going, Cha Sueng Baek was reporting to
Peoria, nearly four months late. Baek, a 19-year-old right-hander
with a Freddy Garcia build, was considered the top high school
pitching prospect in South Korea when he signed with the M's last
September for $1.3 million. His military obligation was the main
issue holding him back in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Class AAA right-hander Kevin Hodges, acquired from Houston for
Matt Mieske last week, threw six scoreless innings Saturday in his
Tacoma debut.
</P>
<P>
   BUHNER UPDATE: Right fielder Jay Buhner (strained left
hamstring) will resume running tomorrow, and told Piniella he's
hoping to be playing again by the start of the Mariners' series in
Anaheim on July 5.

THE KINGDOME GOES OUT ON WINNING NOTE, AWASH IN MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELLIS E. CONKLIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For more than three emotion-chilled hours Sunday
afternoon, no one cared to call it the Dump on the Duwamish.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Kingdome on its final date with baseball _ this ungainly
pill of a pillbox, celebrated as a practical, no-frills and at
times heroic home to a generation of fans _ was bathed in memories.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes misted and goose bumps flared during a touching postgame
memoir as thrilling highlights of past victories danced on the
DiamondVision screen. At every turn, the magic playoff ride of 1995
was invoked. A father hugged his son as they watched a replay of
the decisive 11th inning of Game 5 of the division playoff series
between the Mariners and New York Yankees that culminated with Ken
Griffey Jr. beaming beneath a pile of giddy teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Current Mariner stars and past legends like Ruppert Jones, Julio
Cruz, Bill Caudill, Alvin Davis, Dave Valle, Dave Henderson, Harold
Reynolds, and, of course, Gaylord Perry, who notched his 300th
victory at the Dome, made a slow promenade in from center field
amid a burst of fireworks and green lasers. It was a Mariner
version of the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, this place has been called an ugly
duckling by a lot of people. She's always been beautiful to me,''
bellowed Dave Niehaus, the radio and TV voice of the Mariners since
their first season 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The last ceremonial pitch was, fittingly enough, tossed for a
strike by 7-year-old Corey Segui, son of Mariner first baseman
David Segui and grandson of Diego Segui, who started the Mariners'
first game on April 6, 1977. After the pitch, a sea of blue and
silver confetti poured down on the green carpet.
</P>
<P>
   From Diego to David Segui, from Danny Kaye to John Ellis, it was
the ecstasies of 22 seasons _ not the agonies _ that were recalled
by a raucous sellout crowd of 56,530.
</P>
<P>
   And, on this last game of 1,755 contests the Mariners played at
the Dome, the home team beat the Texas Rangers, 5-2. The final
tally: 852 wins and 903 losses, witnessed by 32,668,785 fans.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a playoff atmosphere enveloped Pioneer Square.
Thousands of fans, many toting souvenir oversized tickets suitable
for framing, lined up in front of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   At Gate D stood Don Harrington. First in line. He had arrived at
8:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched them build this. I needed to be here,'' Harrington
said.
</P>
<P>
   At Gate B, Janet Longley waited with her two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally got to take them to a game,'' she said. ``Made it
just in time, didn't I? I really wanted them to see the Kingdome.
People have made a lot of fun of it, but they're going to miss it
when it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10:40 a.m., most of the Mariners were still in street
clothes, just beginning to dress for the game. The locker room was
quiet. Only the murmur of the Yankee-Oriole game on a television
could be heard. Edgar Martinez was getting a haircut. Ken Griffey
Jr. was playing ball with his son Trey, and chatting with his
father, Ken Griffey Sr., who is the batting coach with the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Mariners General Manager) Woody (Woodward) told me to come on
out. Said I owed him a favor,'' Griffey Sr. said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui said the thought of moving into Safeco Field on July
15 hasn't dawned on him yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really a sentimental person. Maybe 'cause players are
used to moving around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Segui said his father planned to attend the game, but there was
a mix-up with his plane ticket.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:25, Ramiro Garcia was manicuring home plate with a broom.
Garcia has been a groundskeeper at the Dome the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sad,'' he said. ``Tomorrow, and no more. Very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariner spokesman Tim Hevly celebrated his 11th birthday at the
Kingdome, which will be demolished next year to make room for the
new Seahawks stadium. He said he's going to miss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole generation has moved through here, the first one ever
to see major league baseball. Now we're moving on,'' Hevly said.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Richards of Seattle said he had tickets to the game on the
infamous evening of July 19, 1994, when three 12-pound wood-fiber
roof tiles tumbled into the box seats of Section 113 between home
plate and first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still keep those tickets,'' Richards said. ``For me, it sort
of represents the worst moment the Kingdome ever had. But things
got better here. The Dome is going out in style today.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:35, the gates opened and thousands pushed their way past
the turnstiles. The Moose, the Mariner mascot, signed commemorative
``I Was There'' T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before noon, dueling signs lined the perimeter
mezzanines _ a testament to mixed feelings. ``Thanks for the
Memories'' read some of them. Said another: ``Out with the Old. In
with the View.''
</P>
<P>
   On the concourse outside the 300 level, Elane Roberts puffed on
a cigarette and gazed out at the shimmering glass and steel that is
Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to be so cold over there. We're not used to
outdoor baseball,'' said Roberts, who attended the Mariner opener
on April 6, 1977 _ a 7-0 loss to the then-California Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raised my kids here. I wanted to take my grandkids, too, so
this is a difficult day for me.''
</P>
<P>
   At 12:40 p.m., Irene Strait, an usher for 21 years, was working
her customary aisle 109 on the 100 level behind home plate where
the Mariner wives sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm crying already,'' she said. ``I don't know what it'll be
like after the game. This is it for me. My knees have pretty well
given out.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, while Annie Tonda was serving up her last
meal in the media cafeteria, Jay Buhner was ruminating in the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss it here. This has been my security blanket. After
almost 11 years, I know every nook and cranny of right field,''
said the ailing Buhner, who signed more than a dozen bats for
Kingdome workers.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:29, the national anthem for the last baseball game at the
Kingdome was sung by county-western singer Lila McCann, who's from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd rose as one as the Mariners took the field at 1:37.
The first pitch came two minutes later when Freddy Garcia served up
a ball to Rangers center fielder Tom Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:55, the Mariners down 2-0, Rick Kaminski, ``The Peanut
Man,'' took a break in the peanut-tossing action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen families grow up here,'' he mused. ``Kids that I've
known have brought their own kids to see me. It's been a wonderful
time. A great trip.''
</P>
<P>
   At 2:04, Griffey strode to the plate. Everywhere, miniature
lights flashed from snapping cameras. Two minutes later, he crushed
a line-drive homer to right field, a three-run blast. It was his
198th round-tripper at the Dome, and it would be the last ever
belted by a Mariner at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   At 3, Griffey raised the roof again with a leaping,
over-the-fence catch to rob Juan Gonzales of a three-run homer. The
crowd's roar was deafening.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:25, Lester Smith, who was part of the original ownership
group that included entertainer Danny Kaye, was rooting in the
owners box along with Ellis, Sen. Slade Gorton, and former King
County executive John Spellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' said Smith, pointing downward to the spirited crowd,
``look at the enjoyment this (Dome) has given all these people.
Baseball would not be here without it.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3:41, the hydroplane races appeared on the screen for the
last time.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:04, a streaker, whom police declined to identify, was in a
holding cell at the Kingdome before being booked for second-degree
trespassing. Seattle Police Officer Larry Harvey called him
``Tarzan.'' In the bottom of the seventh inning, the young man, in
jock strap and sneakers, sprinted into left field, where he
performed a cartwheel before being spiritedaway.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:28, Griffey struck out swinging with the bases loaded on a
1-2 count from Rangers rookie Mike Venafro. He was the last Mariner
to bat at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:40, Rusty Greer lifted a long fly ball to left field that
Brian Hunter easily hauled in, and that was it. Baseball was over
at the Dome.

INKSTER SLAMS DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ Juli Inkster made an emotional walk into the
history books of the game Sunday on a sultry afternoon out here in
the Brandywine Valley, becoming just the second woman and sixth
player overall to win golf's Grand Slam when she slammed the door
shut on her pursuers with an eagle-birdie-birdie finish to win the
LPGA Championship at DuPont CC. She joined Pat Bradley as the
second to win the modern women's slam.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shining moment, as Inkster pumped her fists after she
holed a birdie putt on the 18th green and was engulfed by the noise
of a roaring crowd fully aware of her accomplishment. Just three
weeks ago at Old Waverly GC in steamy West Point, Miss., Inkster
had won the US Women's Open. She'd earlier won the Dinah Shore (in
1984 and 1989) and the du Maurier (1984), the last two of the four
tournaments that make up the modern slam. (Mickey Wright and Louise
Suggs won a slam when two of the tourneys were different).
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, who turned 39 just three days ago, completed her run
with a 6-under-par 65 Sunday for a 16-under 268 to beat persistent
challenger Liselotte Neumann (68) by four shots after her
four-birdie barrage wilted in the face of Inkster's heroic finish.
Nancy Scranton faltered late and settled for a 70, winding up in a
tie for third at 273 with early finisher Mardi Lunn (66) as a
jammed leaderboard broke up in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Embracing younger daughter Cori, with older daughter Haley at
her side, Inkster had been mother, chef, and bottle washer this
week. She also had a magic wand on the greens as she saved pars on
the 13th and 14th, ran in an eagle putt with a perfect right-left
curl from 15 feet on the 16th, hit an 8-iron into the par 3 17th
and made a 3-foot putt, and made the 25-foot putt for birdie on 18.
</P>
<P>
   This completed a remarkable run. She said Saturday she felt
there was more pressure to win the US Women's Open because she had
a four-shot lead entering the final round. ``Here it's really
anybody's tournament,'' she said. Six players either led outright
or shared the lead Sunday. ``It's the person who's going to make
the least amount of mistakes,'' Inkster said. She has a 68.6 stroke
average in the first three majors this year, with the du Maurier to
come.
</P>
<P>
   If Inkster needed something to jump start her round with so many
players in the hunt, it came with birdies on the eighth (5 iron, 20
feet) and par 5 ninth (sand wedge, 15 feet) to get to 12 under. The
killer touch started at the par-3 13th, where she saved par, and
the par-4 14th, when she saved it out of a trap. The two putts were
of 8 feet. ``Those were key,'' she said. Then came the finishing
stretch; she had just seven putts over the final six holes and only
15 over the last 12 holes. That is how you win majors, just ask
Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   After the walk up the hill on the 18th after she struck a 7-iron
second shot to 25 feet, she made the putt and promptly realized she
had become a part of the game's lore. She also took a giant step
toward getting into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The last player with a realistic chance to catch Inkster was
Neumann, whose first victory was the US Women's Open 11 years ago
when she was just 22. After she made her fourth birdie on the
incoming nine, hitting out of a bunker to 4 feet on the 16th, she
could hear the roars of the crowd behind her. ``I felt if I could
birdie 17 or 18 I might have a chance,'' she said. ``I hit a good
shot on 17, but I got a bad kick. I gave myself a good opportunity
on 18 maybe. I was walking up and saw Juli had eagled 16 so that's
where I was at that point. I was putting for second.''
</P>
<P>
   So this was Inkster's day to bask in the hazy sunshine. She's
balanced her life between family, her home in Palo Alto, Calif.,
and the LPGA Tour. ``I saved par on seven,'' she said after she
surged past Karrie Webb to the top of the LPGA money list, ``and
that really got me going. I played well today. There were a lot of
people in it. I hit my career shot on 16, and then to make that
putt was an electric feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to calm down a little bit. I knew had a two-shot lead.
When I finally got to 18, it was putting into a bucket. I just knew
it was going in. I always thought I wanted to win the four majors.
I won two really quick, and I wondered if I was ever going to win
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be able to sit back and really reflect on it later,
because it is quite an accomplishment. I felt a lot of pressure at
the Open because I felt it was my tournament. This tournament was
anybody's tournament.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tim Wakefield could walk into any VFW club or American
Legion hall in a six-state radius and be given the same advice.
</P>
<P>
   Never volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   But there are enough Purple Hearts floating around to show that
the vets often ignored their own counsel. And while Wakefield took
a hit in Sunday's 7-6 loss to the White Sox, blowing a save for the
first time since he agreed to serve as closer in Tom Gordon's
absence, he wasn't looking for the nearest foxhole for refuge.
</P>
<P>
   On a day the Sox led, 5-0, after two innings, Wakefield was
unable to hold a two-run lead in a ninth inning that began with
third baseman Lou Merloni's second throwing error of the game and
reached its nadir when reserve infielder Craig Wilson hit a two-run
homer that put Chicago ahead. The knuckleballer, who had been
perfect on the seven previous occasions he'd been called upon to
protect a Sox advantage, was asked if it might be best to be thrust
in the same circumstances ASAP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, I've never been in this situation,'' Wakefield
said. ``I'm doing it on a volunteer basis.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gordon out indefinitely with a bad elbow, Wakefield is in
for a longer tour of duty in the bullpen than he anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it takes,'' he said. ``I've always been the type of
guy who tries to help the ball club win. Obviously, I didn't get it
done today. But I'd like to get back out there tomorrow and redeem
myself a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox appeared well on their way to their third straight
win over their pale cousins when Troy O'Leary doubled home two runs
in the first and Nomar Garciaparra hit a three-run double in the
second, extending his hitting streak to 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were left to sort through the surprise of losing
for only the third time in 45 games in which they'd led after eight
innings. The loss, which ended their four-game winning streak and
was only their second in the last nine games, dropped them two
games behind the Yankees in the AL East for the first time since
May 13.
</P>
<P>
   At first, manager Jimy Williams tried explaining that these
things happen. ``They happen because they've got heartbeats, that's
what makes them people,'' he said. ``You can't be perfect all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he sensed that his interrogators smelled blood,
Williams took another tack. ``The cup's half empty around here,''
he said. ``Mine's half full.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager's patience went on life support when someone with a
microphone asked him if there were times he went home wishing he
could do some things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Little League team do you coach?'' Williams said evenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played in Braintree,'' his questioner replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Braintree surgeon,'' Williams said, pulling out the
Jimywocky.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, his questioner tried to get in the last word,
assuring Williams he wasn't pursuing a negative course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Williams said. ``Not in New England.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox teed off on rookie Brian Rose in the fourth, when
Frank Thomas homered past the TV cameras in center, Greg Norton
cranked one into the right-field grandstand, Brook Fordyce hit the
next pitch for a double, and Wilson, a light-hitting backup whose
previous 10 hits this season were singles, hit his first home run
into the left-field screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got a five-run lead, you want to get your team
back in the dugout as soon as you can and stay away from the big
inning,'' Rose said. ``Unfortunately, that didn't happen today.
Basically, one pitch hurt me, and that was my slider. It was pretty
flat that inning. The hanging slider got me today. There weren't
many, but they hit 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who hadn't given up three home runs in an inning since
Jose Canseco's Oakland A's hit four in the third inning Aug. 21,
1997, suddenly went from tanning salon to sweatbox in Sunday's
88-degree temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe, who spelled Rose after the fifth, kept the heat from
rising with three hitless innings of relief. But the Sox left the
bases loaded in the fifth, when Creighton Gubanich was called out
on strikes, and in the sixth, Merloni and Garciaparra both bounced
out with Darren Lewis on third with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Chicago third baseman Norton made his third error of
the game, throwing away Jason Varitek's grounder, and easily could
have been charged with a fourth when Merloni singled off his glove
to score Varitek, the Sox had a two-run lead and Wakefield on deck
for the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But Merloni, who earlier was wide with a sidearm throw for a
no-harm, no-foul error in the third, threw high to first baseman
Mike Stanley on Carlos Lee's bouncer to start the ninth. ``That
second one, I rushed it,'' Merloni said. ``It was an aggressive
play, but I threw a little high.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught it and tagged (Lee) in the head, but he was already
on the bag,'' Stanley said. ``A little sooner, and it would have
been no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton then lined a ball off Stanley's glove for a double.
``Tipped off the top of my glove,'' Stanley said. ``I was never
very good at jumping.''
</P>
<P>
   Fordyce's sacrifice fly made it 6-5, and Wilson then buried a
1-and-0 pitch into the screen. Stanley drew a leadoff walk in the
bottom of the ninth, but was erased in a game-ending double play
turned by shortstop Mike Caruso, who made a diving stop of Reggie
Jefferson's grounder up the middle, then flipped to Wilson, who
ignored oncoming pinch runner Trot Nixon to finish off the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like they stole one from us,'' said Merloni, who has
spent the week bouncing from second to short to third. ``The
biggest thing for me here is my defense, but I didn't do the things
I need to do. Every play counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Braintree.

BRITISH SET TO MAKE WIMBLEDON RACKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ They waited late into the moonless English night. Their
vigil was illuminated only by the wan light from the corridor to
the players' locker room at the All England Club. It was witnessed
only by the skeletal security force eager to close up shop some two
hours after the day's final match concluded at about 8:30.
</P>
<P>
   There were approximately 30 of them, mostly teenagers, and they
were armed with cameras, programs, scraps of paper, and symbols of
their allegiance, such as the Union Jack that served as a wrap for
one girl. They stood alongside and atop the railing that prevented
them from gaining access to the silver van waiting outside the
doorway, protected by a lone sentry.
</P>
<P>
   At last, the reason they had sacrificed most of their social
opportunities on a Friday night appeared. Greg Rusedski emerged
from the darkness into the adulation as the throng besieged and
beseeched him, congratulated and exhorted him. While camera flashes
dotted the night like shooting stars, Rusedski obliged his
constituency by signing whatever was thrust at him for two minutes.
Then he climbed into the van and was off. Unsated, the entourage
followed the vehicle off the grounds like dogs mesmerized by
spinning tires.
</P>
<P>
   Such is this nation's craving for a male Wimbledon champion that
it is willing to embrace a player who is British by virtue of
loophole, not birth. Rusedski was born in Montreal, son of a
Canadian father, and he capitalized on his mother's English
citizenship to migrate to this more accommodating tennis climate.
He has no more of a British accent than does Wayne Gretzky, but
that is utterly irrelevant to the true believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows his roots,'' said one of the hardy souls who wouldn't
leave the grounds until catching a glimpse of him.
</P>
<P>
   And the Brits know what they're rooting for. They are the Red
Sox fans of tennis, having waited 63 years since the reign of Fred
Perry (1934-36) for another British Wimbledon king. If Jack the
Ripper could win on the final Sunday at Centre Court, they'd
probably exalt him.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, they now have two more appealing _ and likelier _
candidates. Ninth seed Rusedski and No. 6 Tim Henman, a born and
bred Brit, have advanced into Monday's round of 16, launching the
second week of The Championships, when, as Rusedski observed after
his third-round victory over Magnus Norman, it truly is anybody's
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The natives are counting on two people in particular, though
neither is guaranteed survival even until midnight Monday. Monday
afternoon lefthander Rusedski will exchange bullets with the only
man on the ATP Tour whose serves can keep up with his,
seventh-seeded Mark Philippoussis. Even more daunting _
psychologically, at least _ Henman will oppose rough-and-ready Jim
Courier. The resilient veteran's last visit to this side of the
Atlantic, in behalf of the American Davis Cup team in April at
Birmingham, was punctuated by indelible five-set triumphs over
Henman and Rusedski, the latter in the fifth and deciding match,
which came down to an 8-6 climax.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted no less a tormentor than former Wimbledon champion
John McEnroe, who is here to play mixed doubles with Steffi Graf
and to talk trash on television, to observe derisively, ``The Brits
are sweating now because of Courier. They choked their fannies off
at Birmingham.''
</P>
<P>
   Bizarre anatomical imagery aside, the British get the point. The
fact is: That loss two months ago still haunts them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win this match desperately,'' said Henman.
</P>
<P>
   But if both somehow get through to Friday _ and Rusedski, in all
likelihood, would have to confront five-time titlist Pete Sampras
first _ it would create an all-English semifinal. The Empire just
might not survive the delirium, for that would guarantee either a
native or adopted son in the championship match.
</P>
<P>
   Until the arrival of Henman and Rusedski _ both born,
portentously enough, on the same date, Sept. 6, though Rusedski,
25, is a year older _ the British haven't had even a middling male
contender since Roger Taylor gained the semis twice in the early
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   It's not for lack of trying. Asked what has ailed British tennis
in the interim, Henman said, ``How long have you got? It's
hopefully beginning to change, and you've seen some of the results.
The likes of (Arvind) Parmar and (Jamie) Delgado and (Miles)
MacLagan'' _ youngsters who were eliminated in the first week but
performed credibly _ ``those are the guys, I think, that need to
keep making that sort of progress. And you look at our (junior)
results at 15 and 16, I think they are much better now. You'd still
have to question perhaps the problem we've had in the past in
making that transition from the junior game to the senior game.
Hopefully, some of those guys can really come through and start
pushing myself and Greg at the top of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski wouldn't mind the company, either. ``Hopefully, players
like Miles and Arvind can build from those experiences and not just
play extremely well at Wimbledon, but take it on all year round,''
he said. ``Hopefully, with the right coaching and the right people
behind them and the right belief, they can move up in the world
rankings and make a positive start from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Henman and Rusedski are it. Or, more precisely,
they're It. They represent England's lone semblance of success on
the world stage. Henman was a semifinalist here last year, a
quarterfinalist the two years before that, and Rusedski was a
quarterfinalist in 1997, the year he nearly made his Grand Slam
breakthrough, losing in the US Open final to Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   Those achievements are relatively modest in comparison to those
of, say, the Americans and Australians and Swedes. But the British
will take what they can get. And while tennis is no better than
third in the sports pecking order here _ behind soccer and cricket
and perhaps even rugby union _ Wimbledon is this nation's World
Series, Super Bowl, NBA Finals, and Stanley Cup finals rolled into
one.
</P>
<P>
   So Henman and Rusedski are bona fide idols, endorsement
millionaires whose every move, breath, and thought is scrutinized
and dissected by the voracious London tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, this is a fortnight in a fishbowl for them.
Henman rediscovered this to his chagrin last Monday when he was
asked about the women pros' campaign seeking earnings parity with
the men in Grand Slam events. He dismissed the crusade as ``getting
a bit greedy'' _ and set off a firestorm. By Thursday, a chastened
Henman said, ``Those comments I made, in hindsight, they probably
created a lot more attention than I wanted. So that's it. I learned
my lesson, and no more talking about equal prize money.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski, who grew up in an environment where a tennis player
wouldn't inspire even a yawn unless he wore skates on the court, is
perhaps more tolerant and appreciative of the attention _ all
right, the mania; what else could you call a legion of followers
wearing, red, white, or blue clown wigs, with ``Tim'' or ``Greg''
inscribed on their faces and the Union Jack functioning as an
article of clothing, at each Henman and Rusedski match? And the
demands they bring with them may not be as evident, but they're
palpable nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just the British public wants a Wimbledon
champion so bad because the last champion was Fred Perry in 1936,''
said Rusedski. ``And I think Tim and I have a great opportunity. I
think this year (the expectations are) more than ever. I think for
myself and for Tim, they really want us to do well. You see a lot
of people face-painted, you know, with either Tim's name or banners
with Tim, or faces painted with my name on it, and things like
that. So it's very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Henman knows that nice isn't enough. The Wimbledon obsession has
been ingrained in him almost since birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biggest, best tournament,'' he said. ``It's where I've always
wanted to play. I realized pretty young that this is what I wanted
to do, and now I'm doing it, I realize I don't want to be just
playing here. I want to win here.''
</P>
<P>
   He shares that sentiment with a nation.

HAMILTON SET TO LET IT RIP IN NBA 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-HAMILTON-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His memories of them are so sharp that you wonder if he is
looking at their photographs. You can ask him about the stars who
played for him at the University of Connecticut. You can ask him
about his role players. Jim Calhoun is the coach who remembers them
all.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Allen: ``He was the most athletic player we've had. He was
beautiful to watch. Watching Ray was like watching ballet on the
basketball court.''
</P>
<P>
   Donny Marshall: ``We have a mile run for our players and Donny
ran the fastest. I think he finished in 4:52. That's not what the
top track people run, but you like to see a basketball player who
can get up and down the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard ``Rip'' Hamilton: ``I once teased him and said, `Rip,
you're from a different place, man.' He thought I was talking about
cities and said, `Yeah, I'm from Coatesville (Pa.).' I said, `No,
Rip. You're from a different era.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said that because it seems as if the 6-foot-6-inch
Hamilton took a wrong turn out of the 1970s and wound up in the
chaotic '90s. All the depressing things you hear about modern
athletes don't apply to him. His ways are old. His game is old,
too. And as we have just witnessed in the NBA Finals, old ways and
old shots (Tim Duncan's bank shot) are back in style.
</P>
<P>
   In two days, some NBA team will call Hamilton's name on draft
day. He has been told he can go as high as fourth, to the Clippers.
He also could go as low as eighth, to the Cavaliers (a pick
previously owned by the Celtics), but not much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The team that acquires him will be happy. Hamilton has a
midrange game, which means he usually takes and makes 17-footers.
He makes his free throws (83 percent last season). He has won a
national championship. He is a good friend of Kobe Bryant's; their
friendship began when they were teammates on the same AAU team.
Bryant is a young star whose game is rooted in flash, leaps, and
spins. Hamilton is not like that. He forces nothing, working
silently and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to say to him, `Was your mother keeping score tonight?
Because I never saw those 30 points you supposedly had,' '' Calhoun
said.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates teased him, too. They teased him for what they
perceived as his innocence. Once, Calhoun and Kevin Freeman were
driving with Hamilton, on their way to East Hartford to speak about
gang intervention. They talked about gangs being prevalent
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in Coatesville,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rip,'' Calhoun replied. ``You've got to be kidding. You live
30 minutes outside of Philly.''
</P>
<P>
   While other guys talked about girls, Hamilton didn't have much
to say: He has dated the same young woman for three years. Even his
nickname has a modern/aged split to it. The name used to belong to
his father, who became Big Rip when Hamilton was born. One story is
that when Big Rip was a child, he always ripped his clothes. Thus
the name. As Little Rip began to excel in basketball, he took over
the name. Now it has a double meaning. People in Hamilton's family
know it was passed down. But there are times when young people talk
about an extraordinary performance and say, ``He ripped it . . . ''
or did something good. Hamilton ripped it in three seasons at
UConn, winning Big East Player of the Year twice. He shared the
honor with Miami's Tim James last season.
</P>
<P>
   After his second season of Ripping it at UConn, Hamilton asked
Calhoun if he should leave school.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 21.5 points per game his second season, but people
wondered about his size. He is listed at 185 pounds. ``I told him
not to worry about his size,'' Calhoun said. ``Reggie Lewis _ God
rest his soul _ was skinny, too. But I never worried about Reggie's
size. He went on to be an All-Star.''
</P>
<P>
   What the coach worried about was psychology. If Hamilton had
left after two seasons, he would have been drafted but probably not
in the lottery. He was a good player, but so young.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was feeling good about himself, but I said, `I don't think
you're ready,' '' Calhoun recalled. ``I told him that he needed to
be a great player longer. All the guys who play the 2 and 3 spots
in the league are great players; you can go through the list. They
are the people who score the points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rip needed to have a psychological base; he needed another
year of knowing that he was a great player. Plus, you get a
positive stigma when you're a lottery selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton waited and won a championship. He won't have to wait
much longer to officially join his friend Bryant in the NBA. By
late Wednesday, he could be a Clipper, Timberwolf, Cavalier, or
Wizard. The NBA didn't institute the lottery system until 1985. But
the people who know Hamilton will understand if someone refers to
him as a lottery pick from the '70s.

`CODED' BANK ACCOUNT NUMBERS STIR FIGHT OVER MARKETING SUCH
INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE HADLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Olympia-based Heritage Bank gave the names, bank
account numbers and addresses of its customers to another company
that then used the information to try to sell the customers
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Benefit Consultants Inc., encrypted each bank
account number in a way it thought would not be identifiable
without a special code.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem: Albert Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, a Heritage Bank customer, received one of the insurance
solicitations. The letter said that if he wanted the insurance, the
company could automatically deduct the cost from his bank account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `How in the Sam Hill could they do that?'''
</P>
<P>
   He soon found out. Examining the insurance solicitation, he
noticed a code in an upper corner. The combination of letters and
numbers seemed odd yet familiar. Drawing on his World War II
cryptography training, Newman, 79, quickly decoded the information
to discover that it was his bank account number.
</P>
<P>
   He was outraged. Newman, who had more than $100,000 in the bank,
began writing letters to the bank, telling it not to give his
account number and other information to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his objections, the mailings continued.
</P>
<P>
   After more than three years of continued solicitations, Newman
finally sued Heritage Bank. The mailings stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Newman has agreed to testify at a July 29 hearing called by the
Washinton state Senate's Commerce, Trade, Housing and Financial
Institutions Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairwoman Sen. Margarita Prentice, D-Seattle, said
she decided to call the hearing because she's concerned about the
increasing reports of banks disclosing customers' account
information to marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really violating that kind of trust relationship we're
supposed to have with our financial institutions,'' she said.
``Banks are built on trust. They've violated this trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Also planning to testify July 29 is John Bley, director of
financial institutions for the state. After Minnesota's attorney
general announced a lawsuit against US Bank for allegedly selling
customer information to a telemarketing firm earlier this month,
Bley's office got more than 100 calls from Washington citizens with
similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``To receive that many was certainly out of the ordinary,'' Bley
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the debate in Congress over new banking privacy
legislation has boiled down to the question of whether the bank
owns customer information or whether the customer owns the
information. Legislation that assumes the bank owns it puts the
burden on the consumer to tell the bank not to give away or sell
the information. Those who believe the customer owns it say the
bank must get the customer's explicit permission before disclosing
the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think most people would say, `No, that's my
information,''' Bley said. Yet that position is treated as
``extreme'' in Congress right now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it such an extreme position that federal law ought to
protect the reasonable privacy expectations of its citizens?'' Bley
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., has introduced banking-privacy
legislation that would put the burden on the consumer to object.
Inslee said he would prefer the legislation put the burden on the
banks to get permission, but he had to compromise to win support
for his bill from moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Inslee also plans to testify at the July 29 hearing in Olympia.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Paula Selis, who is investigating
BrandDirect Marketing, is also expected to testify at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Bley said banks use the questionable tactics because they're in
``a highly competitive industry in a securities market that demands
maximum return.'' Bank executives might be loathe to resort to
disclosing account information, ``but the securities market tells
financial institutions if you're not going to maximize return,
you're going to be subject to hostile takeover, and management will
be put in place to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Heritage Bank declined to comment on Newman's suit because it is
in litigation. But letters from bank attorneys to Newman's Olympia
attorney, Shawn Newman (no relation), contend that the bank is
providing the account information to Benefit Consultants merely to
``assist the bank in communicating with its customers.''
</P>
<P>
   That is proper and not a violation of Albert Newman's rights,
wrote Heritage attorney William Holt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems basic that Heritage has the right to communicate with
its customers. It can do this through its own employees or through
independent contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shawn Newman said this was not communication between
Heritage and Albert Newman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hired independent contractors to solicit their bank
customers to purchase insurance. This is not an internal deal,''
Shawn Newman said. ``This came from Trumbull, Connecticut. These
are independent contractors that are soliciting for the Insurance
Company of North America.''
</P>
<P>
   The solicitation invited Albert Newman to fill out an
``application to Insurance Company of North America for accidental
death and dismemberment insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The solicitation included a letter signed by Heritage Chairman
Donald Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage recently offered Albert Newman money to settle the
suit, but Albert Newman said he turned it down because it would
have required him not to discuss the suit or his complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said far from wanting to ``shut my mouth'' about his
experience, he wants to shout it from the mountain top.

   ``I want the public to know what the banks are doing to them and
the fact that they're so arrogant that if you question them, they

   In the field artillery during World War II, Newman said his unit
was given instruction in cryptography so they could decipher and
encode messages. A common technique then was to use letters to
stand for numbers and vice versa, he said. Benefit Consultant's
code was simple to break, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who ran a boat repair yard in Vallejo, Calif., before he
retired, also wants to be compensated for the $5,000 or $6,000 in
lost interest he incurred in transferring his funds out of the bank
and for his legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to hire an attorney to shut it off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once someone has your bank account number, they can find out
many other things about you, including the amount of money in your
account, both Albert and Shawn Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Summary judgment motions in the case are to be heard in Thurston
County Superior Court Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, the bank's stated policy said the bank
would disclose Newman's account information to third parties only
where necessary to complete transfers, to verify the existence and
condition of his account for a third party such as credit bureau or
merchant, or to comply with court orders. Also, information could
be disclosed if he gave permission or if his account was closed for
abuse or because he owed the bank money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says there you're in safe haven. They don't tell you that
for a couple of bucks they'll sell everything about you,'' Albert
Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank maintains it does not sell any account information but
refused to be questioned on the assertion. Shawn Newman said the
bank may technically not be paid specifically for the information,
but undoubtedly receives some form of commission for insurance
sales that result from the solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   Another bank attorney wrote Shawn Newman that generally the bank
does not provide its customer list or account numbers to third
parties, but on occasion the bank has ``an opportunity to offer
services to its customers through third-party providers.'' In
another letter, Rhodes, the Heritage chairman, wrote that more than
2,000 customers signed up for the insurance, causing the bank to
believe that its customers valued the service.
</P>
<P>
   The first $1,000 of coverage is provided free; customers pay for
any additional coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's lawsuit alleges that the bank's disclosure of his
account information was a breach of contract, negligent, an
invasion of privacy and violated the state's Consumer Protection
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Walsh, a professor of tort law at the University of
Washington, said he thinks many juries might well decide against
the bank on most of these points.
</P>
<P>
   Most customers would want to be ``clearly alerted'' to the
possibility that the bank would disclose their account information
to a third party, Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinctive sense is that a lot of people really would find
this offensive,'' he said.

WILSON FILLS THE BILL(S) 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-WILSON-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The three $100 dollar bills were neatly tucked behind
the nameplate above Craig Wilson's locker in the visitors'
clubhouse at Fenway Park. Without counting his loot, Wilson quickly
stuffed it in the front pocket of the blue jeans hanging in his
stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just nothing,'' Wilson smiled, when asked about the
money. ``It's just something somebody owed me.''
</P>
<P>
   What it was was a much-welcomed incentive bonus from Frank
Thomas, who was happy to pay Wilson his bounty after the utility
infielder and .200 hitter provided the Chicago White Sox with an
unlikely source of power by belting a pair of two-run homers in
Sunday's 7-6 victory over the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, Wilson was Chicago's big money player.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson went 2 for 3 and drove in four runs with his two homers,
his first and second of the season. But he didn't just do it with
his bat. After starting the game at shortstop and moving to second
base in the seventh when Mike Caruso entered at short, Wilson
turned Caruso's spectacular diving grab of a Reggie Jefferson
grounder up the middle into a game-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we had fun today,'' Thomas said when asked if he
was the philanthropist who left the cash in Wilson's locker. ``I
told the guy, `You do something special today, you get paid for it,
but we gotta win.' And Craig Wilson put us on his back and he did
(do something special). He hit two home runs, and he didn't have
one all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Until he teed off Sunday against Sox starter Brian Rose in the
fourth and knuckleballer Tim Wakefield in the ninth, touching each
for a critical two-run blast.
</P>
<P>
   After going 0 for 2 as a defensive replacement in Boston's 17-1
massacre Saturday, Wilson capped a four-run outburst on three
homers off Rose in the fourth with a 370-foot shot to the screen in
left that scored Brook Fordyce and rallied the White Sox from a 5-0
deficit to within a run.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Wilson took Wakefield deep for a two-run shot that
proved the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's swings, like (Saturday) when I went 0 for 2, where I
felt like I was having a pretty good approach and putting some
pretty good swings on the ball,'' Wilson said. ``It's kind of the
way it's been the last couple of weeks. I felt comfortable up
there, but I just hadn't put the right part of the bat on the ball.
I'd been hitting them on the barrel, but I'd hit the top of the
ball. Today, I just went up there and tried to shorten up my swing
a little bit and made good solid contact.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right on the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy (with his fourth-inning homer),'' said Wilson, who
entered with a .200 average with no RBIs or homers and improved to
.222 with four RBIs and the two homers by game's end. ``I was just
trying to get a two-out hit. I haven't gotten one, a two-out RBI,
let alone an RBI, the whole year. I guess I just hit them in
streaks. I can't explain it, but I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   So how did Thomas figure Wilson as his ``pick to click'' when he
offered $300 to the player who lifted the White Sox out of their
doldrums?
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out huge,'' Thomas said. ``Sometimes when a guy lays
it on the line, he can't do it. But Craig was a money player for us
today. And it had to come out of my pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing six of their previous 10 games, and two in a row,
Thomas's clubhouse challenge ``was just an incentive to play hard
today, that's all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So how was Wilson going to spend his winnings?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably take everyone out to eat,'' Wilson grinned.
``Probably McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred dollars can buy a lot of Happy Meals.

PAR SUITS BYRD FINE 
</HEADLINE>
 AMATEUR-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUMFORD, R.I. _ Jonathan Byrd was ahead by four strokes entering
Sunday's final round of the 38th annual Northeast Amateur
Invitational at 6,661-yard Wannamoisett Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't make the Clemson University student from Columbia,
S.C., feel secure, however. Byrd, who placed ninth in the Atlantic
Coast Conference Championships and 16th in the NCAA Division 1
Championships, believed the front nine would be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd did well, completing those holes in even par, and with a
birdie and a bogey on the back nine shot a par 69. His 274 total
was seven strokes better than 18-year-old Australian Arron Baddeley
(67_281).
</P>
<P>
   Bryce Molder of Georgia Tech and Conway, Ark., finished third
with a 73_282, with bogeys on the last four holes. Mike Capone and
David Eger tied for fourth at 283. Capone, from Cranston, R.I., and
Wake Forest, shot a 71 while Eger, a 37-year-old from Ponte Verda
Beach, Fla., fired a 73, which included five bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel that I had a solid golf stroke, one that didn't
break down,'' said Byrd, who was named a first-team all-NCAA
Division 1 All-American this spring. ``I hit shots all day long
that I was impressed with. My swing and my tempo both stayed good
under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd handled himself well on the front side. ``I wanted to play
those first holes aggressively, but put myself in the right spots
where pars are good scores,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd made par on the second hole with a 6-footer that had about
a four-inch break. ``I got a lot of confidence from that,'' he
said. Byrd, who birdied the 13th and bogeyed the 16th, made a
5-footer on the fifth hole to save par, missed a 4-footer on the
seventh for birdie, and was able to get up-and-down from the right
bunker on the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could get some bogeys and let everybody back in the
tournament or I could get pars and maybe some birdies and kind of
keep my distance, and that's what I did all day long,'' he said.
``I only had three bad hits. It's been a long time since I've
played like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd knew the title was his on the 16th, when he shot a bogey 5.
``I could have made a double there after missing the green, having
to punch out of the trees, and if I got doubles, I think I would
have let people stay in the match,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baddeley, who was playing in his first US Amateur and has been
compared with countryman Greg Norman, played well, with five
birdies and two bogeys. He hopes to play another year as an amateur
and possibly turn pro. He doesn't like the comparisons to Norman,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't focus on what people say,'' Baddeley said. ``You've
got to practice on things you've got to improve on, you have to
pick up shots here and there. I worry about the future, not the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Molder, the 1998 NCAA Division 1 Collegiate Player of the Year,
knew he needed a sterling round to catch Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in wanting to win, but what I really wanted was to have
a chance going into the last day and I did that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a little frustrating right now. I didn't give up but
I just lost my concentration when I realized that winning was out
of the picture. Maybe I was worn out or I had bad concentration. I
just wished I finished better.''

BRUINS HOPE TO FIND INSTANT KARMA 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-BRUINS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two years ago, when the Bruins were picking No. 1 and
No. 8 in the NHL draft, held that year at the Igloo in Pittsburgh,
there was rampant optimism among management and fans that the club
would be coming out of the annual crapshoot with two impact players
who would help turn the franchise around after it had missed the
playoffs for the first time in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   They selected Joe Thornton and Sergei Samsonov and both are
living up to expectations, with Samsonov the early thriller and
Calder Trophy winner and Thornton coming into his own in his second
year.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at the FleetCenter, with the Bruins' first two
selections coming at Nos. 21 and 56, it appeared there wasn't much
chance of grabbing instant contributors.
</P>
<P>
   However, that changed when Boston went after a pair of
20-year-old Memorial Cup-winning teammates in defenseman Nick
Boynton and left wing Matt Zultek. Boynton, who was the most
valuable player of the tournament as the Ottawa 67s knocked off the
Calgary Hitmen in the finals, and Zultek had been through this
drill before.
</P>
<P>
   Boynton was taken with the No. 9 overall pick by Washington in
1997, one selection after Samsonov, but thought the Capitals were
low-balling him. Part of the problem was that the Capitals, who
failed to make the postseason just before the draft, were in a
state of transition. The front office changed and Boynton said in
some ways he felt he was a victim of the incoming philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might have had something to do with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks expressed interest in Boynton and tried to get
something done before he went back into the draft, but the
youngster said that offer was even lower, so he took his chances.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he'll have the privilege (unenviable task?) of negotiating
with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   In Boynton's favor is the fact he is two years closer to playing
than an 18-year-old would be. He's had four years of junior hockey,
he's filled out to 6 feet 1 inch, 210 pounds, which certainly will
help his transition to the NHL. Even better for Boston, if he
doesn't prove ready for the NHL, he could play in Providence.
Boynton had 11 goals and 59 points in 51 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a terrific defenseman,'' said assistant general
manager Mike O'Connell. ``For us, he was probably the best
defenseman who was available in the draft. He was the Memorial Cup
MVP, a first-round pick a couple of years ago, and he's two years
closer to playing than most of these other kids. With the depth we
have on the blue line, we feel he'll get a chance to play this year
for us. If not, he'll play in Providence, which is a huge, huge
plus for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Zultek is mammoth, listed at 6-4 and 222 pounds. He was taken
with the 15th pick overall in '97 by the Los Angeles Kings but they
couldn't come to terms by the June 1 deadline, despite some serious
negotiating by GM Dave Taylor, so Zultek went back in.
</P>
<P>
   With Thornton, Samsonov, Boynton, and Zultek, the Bruins now
have four of the top 15 players taken in the first round of that
'97 draft and three of the top nine.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Bruins very much would like to see Zultek throw his
weight around a lot more, the fact is he's a left wing who can
score. The Bruins don't exactly have a boatload of those. Zultek
tallied 33 goals and 66 points in 56 games. Sure that's junior
hockey, but if management believes he could use some seasoning, he
always can go down to Providence for a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Saturday's draft wasn't as big as 1997 in terms of
players with name recognition, but if the Bruins can come to terms
with these two prospects, it would go a long way toward beefing up
their roster.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said he was intrigued by the first two picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can get in there now and play, that's a lot better,''
he said.

AYALA WIN OVER TAPIA IS A HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Freddie Roach knew his man was in trouble before the
first bell tolled Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   As the veteran trainer turned to squirt some water on the
mouthpiece of the World Boxing Association bantamweight champion
minutes before the first round of a title defense against Paulie
Ayala, Roach lost sight of his fighter for a moment. In that
instant Johnny Tapia's unraveling began.
</P>
<P>
   When Roach looked back there was an emotional Tapia in the
center of the ring pushing Ayala in the chest. As he had hoped, the
challenger had managed to raise Tapia's ire.
</P>
<P>
   Roach was already aware his tightly wrapped boxer's emotions
were on edge as his first defense of the 118-pound title
approached, but he was sure he would remain professional about his
work because that is how he had won two world titles and not lost
in 48 fights. But after he saw his fighter angrily charge Ayala for
no reason, he knew where Tapia was. He was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad sign,'' Roach said of the brief incident that
opened what would turn out to be Tapia's first defeat in nearly 11
years, a close but unanimous 12-round decision after which Ayala
collapsed in the ring in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm usually more observant than that. I usually don't let my
fighter get away from me, but I didn't want to put a dry mouthpiece
in Johnny's mouth. I turned away for a second and he was gone.
After I got to him, I told him, `Johnny, keep your head.' Johnny
was really angry with this guy. He got caught up in the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he did enough not to lose his title. He didn't fight
a smart fight, but it was maybe one of the best fights I ever
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   No eyewitness would dispute that even if they might debate the
decision that broke Tapia's winning streak and dropped his record
to 46-1-2. There may be a better fight sometime this year but it's
not likely.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 rounds, two wiry and wise fighters stood toe-to-toe
trying to take each other's measure. From the first bell to the
last the crowd at the Mandalay Bay Events Center was roaring as
first Ayala would fire away with rapid combinations in close and
then Tapia would respond with crushing body shots to the liver and
his own fierce retaliations.
</P>
<P>
   Round after round it ground on this way. Neither man was willing
to fall and seldom would even retreat. So close were many of the
rounds that the judges agreed only four times yet they all agreed
at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Jutras had Ayala winning, 115-114, but with a 1-point change
in the 11th round, which he called a draw, the fight would have
been even in his eyes. Duane Ford and Fernando Viso had it 116-113
and scored the last round even. Had they given it to Tapia, as many
ringside observers did, only 2 points would have separated the two.
It was no different on the Globe's card, which had Ayala winning,
115-113, by giving him the last two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   For Tapia it was a harsh night but the kind he always has
refused to back down from. Although he started slowly and ended the
same way, in the middle he came on strong and seemed to seize the
fight after the 10th round, as he often had in the past, with a
relentless body attack and superior experience. But those were
other nights, not this one, in fights against other men, not this
one.
</P>
<P>
   This time Ayala had a little too much youth and a little too
much hand speed, more often finishing off their exchanges than the
champion could manage, which made the difference. Yet even though
Tapia refused to do what he does best _ box masterfully _ he still
nearly pulled out the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Had Ayala not successfully goaded the champion into abandoning
the style that brought him first the junior bantamweight and then
bantamweight championships as well as a big-money victory over
hard-punching Danny Romero two years ago, perhaps things might have
been different. But Tapia could not control his warring emotions
and Ayala took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tapia goes on his emotions,'' Ayala (21-1) said. ``I wanted to
goad them. When he pushed me it was all part of it. We were playing
some mind games. I intended to wish him luck but he was in a
different mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapia was in war mode and that's what the fight became from the
first. Ayala started quickly, winning the first three rounds with
his quick hands and some searing combinations, but when you fight
Tapia you need to bring a full lunch pail, so just when some were
thinking the 32-year-old champion had perhaps had it, he came back,
scoring with some powerful shots in the middle rounds and some
devastating body punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught me with some good body shots but I could take
them,'' Ayala said. ``I wanted to make it this kind of fight.
Johnny's a great boxer and a legendary junior bantamweight but that
doesn't work in the bantamweights. He caught me with some shots but
I've been blessed with good whiskers.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing because Ayala needed them, and some cast iron ribs to
go with them to hold off Tapia, and that he did by winning more of
the toe-to-toe exchanges, of which there were so many it reminded
you what a great fight really is.
</P>
<P>
   It is trench warfare, hand-to-hand combat of the fiercest and
bravest kind. Here were two fighters unwilling to back down and
able to take all the other was ready to give for the opportunity to
return fire. When it was over, even the hard-nosed Tapia grudgingly
conceded this might have been Ayala's night, as his scratched and
marked face testified. Yet just as with his champion's belt, he was
not willing to make such a concession without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my last fight with Top Rank,'' Tapia said of promotor
Bob Arum, suggesting Arum favored the younger Ayala even though he
holds rights to both fighters. ``You know what happened. Everybody
knows what happened. I thought I won but I give total respect to
Paulie. I was banging him to the body. I hurt him with every shot.
Nobody got hurt and the best man won. Put up the money and we'll do
it again.''
</P>
<P>
   As well they should, because it is for nights like this that
fight fans live. It was an affair of the heart, a brutal work of
art played out on a 20-foot canvas in which one man beat another
but nobody really lost.

ZENGA MAKING BELIEVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Walter Zenga so far has reached his first
goal as player-coach of the Revolution. His team has yet to be
blown out of a game and much of the players' self-confidence has
returned.
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks also to the abysmal failures of the MetroStars and
Miami, the Revolution appear to have realistic hopes of being in
playoff contention, even after a 2-0 loss at Dallas Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good team now,'' Zenga said. ``You remember at the
start of the season when you said we were playing Italian-style,
defensive. Well, in this game what happened? We played against
Dallas, the (second-place) team in the West, and they only have two
chances to score until the final seconds. We have a lot of chances
to score, and it is Dallas that is on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say we were unlucky, but we deserved better. Now, we
have to continue to work and put ourselves in position to win every
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Revolution are acting, and often playing, like a
team that believes in itself. They have surrendered as many as
three goals only twice and the specter of 6-1 and 5-1 defeats of
last year seems to have faded.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution feel secure defensively, so the other parts of
their game have a chance to flourish. Joe-Max Moore, Giovanni
Savarese, and Johnny Torres hit the crossbar or goal posts in the
first half as Dallas retreated into defense.
</P>
<P>
   But the Burn displayed a composed counterattacking ability, and
Leonel Alvarez and Jason Kreis combined to set up Jorge ``El
Zarco'' Rodriguez for a 37th minute goal. The Revolution seem able
to impose their will on the opposition, and dictate the pace of the
game, but they have not developed as poised a counterattack as the
Burn.
</P>
<P>
   The role reversal was significant. As the underdog visiting
team, the Revolution should have been the ones to absorb pressure
and counter. Instead, Dallas took on that role and the Revolution
appeared to be in a position of strength.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to maintain that attitude when they host the
MetroStars Sunday and Los Angeles July 11 in the final games before
the midseason all-star break.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 and '98 seasons, the Revolution became extremely
vulnerable because of lack of depth and lack of vibrant,
complementary personalities. But they compensated for the loss of
starters Richard Goulooze (Achilles' strain), John Harkes
(hamstring strain), and Ivan McKinley (suspension) against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Gori, acquired from Miami in a trade for Edwin Gorter,
performed well at left back. And Jamar Beasley, Paulo Dos Santos,
and Paul Keegan provided reinforcement off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams looked tired and that's one reason why we couldn't
capitalize on mistakes,'' Torres said. ``It's tough when you get
behind. If we had scored a goal, we could have sat back and
defended, paced ourselves a little bit.''

EMPTYING OUT CUP PRETENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Now, the real World Cup begins. Now, the
teams that belong here get to play among their peers. Now, it's go
on or go home. Everybody else _ the Mexicans, the Japanese, the
Ghanaians, the Canadians and the rest of the no-hopers _ is already
at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, there aren't 16 world-class women's soccer teams.
There are barely eight, which happens to be the size of the Olympic
field. So, as everyone predicted, there were some hilarious
first-round mismatches _ US 7, Nigeria 1 . . . Brazil 7, Mexico 1 .
. . China 7, Ghana 0 . . . Germany 6, Mexico 0 . . . Norway 7,
Canada 1 . . . Russia 5, Japan 0. This was women's ice hockey with
corner kicks.
</P>
<P>
   You could argue that FIFA, the international federation, was
dreaming when it expanded the Cup field from 12 to 16 this time.
You also could argue that FIFA was visionary. If the future of
football is feminine, as president Sepp Blatter says, more
countries need to be involved at the world level. If that means a
bunch of 7-1 laughers, such is the price of progress.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike men's soccer, which has been a mature global sport for at
least half a century, the women's game progresses quickly. The
Brazilians scored one goal in the 1991 Cup. This time, they won
their group and likely will play the Americans in the semifinals.
The North Koreans never had qualified for the tournament and rarely
play outside Asia. But they beat Denmark, should have drawn with
Nigeria, and hung with the Americans for more than an hour
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. Ghana tied Australia. The Italians drew with the
Germans. None of that would have happened four years ago. ``I said
there would be some lopsided matches, but I said there would also
be some upsets,'' said US coach Tony DiCicco.
</P>
<P>
   The learning curve at this level is painful but rapid. The
Mexicans, who cobbled a team together and qualified on a
shoestring, were hammered in their first two matches. But they held
the Italians to 2-0 here Sunday. ``It was like going from
kindergarten to the university level,'' concluded coach Leonardo
Cuellar. ``But we needed the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   They also needed a benchmark to take home with them to convince
their grudging federation that better organization and more money
are needed if the Mexicans want to get their women to anywhere near
where their men are.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot go to the World Cup without a national team,''
Cuellar said. ``You cannot go recruiting players from the streets
and bringing some from abroad. They must take care of the women's
program. We are going to demand that.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of countries _ the US, Norway, China, Germany, Sweden
_ have pumped resources into their women's teams for a decade or
more. The Australians, who are hosting both the 2000 Olympics and
the 2003 World Cup, have invested more than $1 million to make sure
the Matildas are respectable. But most countries consider the
women's game an amusing curiosity at best.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerians, who have played in all three Cups, still have to
fight old husbands' tales that playing soccer will keep women from
having babies. ``My girls are strong, but they need more
exposure,'' said coach Ismaila Mabo. ``When we get back to Nigeria
we will mount pressure on our government to see that we get more
for the next World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Americans and Norwegians and Chinese, the Cup is about
winning. For almost everybody else, it's about merely getting on
the radar screen back home. The Italians finished sixth in 1991,
didn't qualify last time, and vanished from sight. They had to get
back on the global stage to become visible again. ``At least back
home we've been getting coverage now,'' said coach Carlo Facchin.
</P>
<P>
   In England and the Netherlands, Argentina and Spain, where
soccer is considered a man's game, nobody cared when the women
didn't qualify. Across most of the world, that is normal. What is
not normal is what has been happening in the States for the past 10
days _ enthusiastic crowds of 79,000 and 65,000 and 50,000 paying
top dollar to watch females kick a ball around.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians and Australians and Ghanaians have been astounded
by what they've seen here. Not merely by the crowds and the
five-deep rows of autograph seekers and the extensive newspaper and
magazine coverage, but by the TV ads. Mia Hamm and Michael Jordan
portrayed as athletic and social equals sends a powerful message to
women who come from countries where basic rights for females, much
less a competitive soccer team, are still a distant dream.
</P>
<P>
   The countries that take women's soccer _ and by extension, women
_ seriously are still here playing. The rest are headed home to
preach the gospel to the unconverted. ``I'm hoping the Italians
will take a good example from this,'' forward Patrizia Panico said.

STARS LEAP OFF US BENCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Shannon MacMillan was the shining light of
the 1996 Olympics, scoring the ``Golden Goal'' against Norway in
the semifinals that sent America into the gold-medal game. Tisha
Venturini has glowed throughout her career, too, scoring the first
US goals in both the '95 World Cup and the '96 Games. They are used
to being starters, used to being stars, used to lighting up the
field when the game is on the line and nothing less than heroics
will do.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't been starting in this Cup, though, victims _ albeit
understanding, accepting ones _ of the US team's unrivaled depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not every day you have players on the bench who have over
100 caps,'' said goalkeeper Briana Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, the stars were back in alignment. With
DiCicco resting four of his regular starters, both MacMillan and
Venturini began the game. Neither went unnoticed, MacMillan
breaking a scoreless tie when she drilled a goal in the 56th
minute, Venturini adding a pair in the 68th and 76th and
embellishing the second with a double backflip for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of them,'' said Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan, whose three Olympic goals led the team in '96,
couldn't help but be a little proud of herself Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, or at
least of her efforts to regain a starting role. ``I like to have my
actions speak louder than my words, because I think Tony (DiCicco,
the US coach) respects that a lot more,'' said the 25-year-old
forward out of the University of Portland who was the 1995 Soccer
America Player of the Year. ``And I think I showed tonight I needed
more time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon, said DiCicco, to know if he'll be able to give it
to her. ``We have a player named Mia Hamm,'' DiCicco explained.
``We have a player named Tiffeny Millbrett. We have a player named
Cindy Parlow. They're pretty outstanding players, too. We'd love to
play with forwards all over the field, but I probably wouldn't have
a job very long if we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he had plenty of praise for the player who, he
said, possesses the hardest shot on the team. ``Her ball moves,''
said DiCicco. ``You can see when she plays a corner kick across the
face of the goal it's a laser, and every time she hits a shot on
goal it's a moving pea the goalkeeper has to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry, who faces her every day in practice, agrees. ``The ball
moves around, it knuckles, it dips,'' she said. ``I feel bad for
the other goalkeeper. I mean today, that ball totally dipped before
it got to that keeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, MacMillan plans to stay the course,
emotionally as well as otherwise. If a reserve is what she is,
she'll be the best, most supportive, readiest one around. ``I'm
ready to do whatever it takes to help this team win,'' she said,
``whether it's starting or coming off the bench or not playing at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco said he appreciates the class MacMillan and Venturini
have brought to their diminished roles. ``It's hard,'' he
acknowledged. ``They're stars. They're professionals. I think they
want to be out there every minute and it's very difficult. That's
why I respect and admire them as much as I do, because I bleed for
them. Tisha has not had a lot of time this year, yet she's stayed
positive and she's brought into the game today and her and Shannon
were our key personalities on the field and got it done for us. I
can't tell you how much I admire the fact they can do that.''

   KOSOVO-BOMB-DAMAGE (Djakovica) _ In the two weeks since NATO
forces arrived in Kosovo, alliance officials have scaled back their
initial estimates of the damage inflicted by the 78-day air
campaign on the Yugoslav army, which they concede remains a force
capable of maintaining Slodoban Milosevic's grip on power. While
NATO and Pentagon officials stand by their claims to have

were clearly not as damaged as they had believed. By Steven Lee

   BARBARY-LIONS (Hoedspruit, South Africa) _ Veterinarians who
examined some abandoned circus animals now say that a lion in the
group is one of the few Barbary lions left in the world. The last
one in the wild was shot in 1921 in Morocco, and for a few months,
there were claims that the circus lion was the only Barbary left.
But the excitement over finding him led small European zoos and
circuses to pipe up, ``Hey _ we've got a lion that looks like
that.'' One of them even agreed to ship its lioness to South
Africa, and now the possibility exists that the subspecies can be
bred back into viability. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.

leader's belief that a spaceship will come and take them all away

`DADDY' SENDS OTHER FILMS TO THEIR ROOMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A robust ``Big Daddy'' ruled over a record-setting
slate at the nation's multiplexes with an estimated $41.2 million
at 3,027 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's Adam Sandler comedy and posted the 14th best opening of
all time and took in nearly double the nearest contender,
``Tarzan'' with its still-impressive $23.5 million at 3,049
theaters in its second weekend. ``Big Daddy'' performed at the high
end of expectations, eclipsing the $39.4 million debut of Sandler's
``The Waterboy'' last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam Sandler's star is definitely on the rise,'' said Robert
Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting service.
``About 75 percent of the people who saw `Big Daddy' went because
of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``Big Daddy'' could eventually top the $161.5
million domestic total for ``The Waterboy,'' 54th biggest grosser
ever in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' will be hugely profitable for Sony, with a
bargain-basement budget reportedly under $35 million. The film, in
which Sandler's slacker character adopts a 5-year-old boy to
impress his girlfriend, drew well in all regions and generated
strong crossover business from audiences beyond the core of young
males, according to Sony spokesman Ed Russell. ``We think we may
get a lot of business from date crowds,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' continued to post solid numbers as attendance fell
only 31 percent from its opening weekend, giving Disney's 37th
animated feature $77 million so far. Distribution chief Chuck Viane
said, ``We think `Tarzan' has tremendous legs to perform this well
against `Big Daddy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Business at movie theaters continued to sizzle as a trio of
holdovers, ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' ``The
General's Daughter'' and ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom
Menace,'' also performed powerfully. Each grossed more than $14
million. Overall, ticket sales totaled $131 million, edging the
$130.1 million record for a nonholiday weekend set last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business continues to be phenomenal,'' said industry tracker
Arthur Rockwell. ``By and large, the pictures have delivered to
their respective audiences so far this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line's ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' took the biggest blow from
``Big Daddy'' with a 41 percent decline from its second weekend as
the sequel came in third with a still impressive $18.5 million at
3,049 theaters. On Sunday, ``The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' which has
been advertised with spoofs of ``Phantom Menace'' and ``Big
Daddy,'' became the 63rd in the elite club of movies that have
topped $150 million, and it appears certain to become the 27th to
pass $200 million by the end of its run.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's second weekend of ``The General's Daughter'' held up
well with a 30 percent decline to $15.6 million at 2,858 theaters.
Even more impressive was 20th Century Fox's sixth weekend of
``Phantom Menace'' with $14.6 million at 3,126 sites, representing
a decline of only 23 percent from its previous weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The George Lucas saga hit $352.4 million in its 40th day. That
represented another record for ``Phantom Menace'': fastest to cross
$350 million, breaking ``Titanic's'' mark by 18 days. ``It's a
phenomenal performance, and there's no doubt it will get to $400
million,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   The only films still in front are ``Titanic'' at $600.8 million,
``Star Wars'' at $460.9 million, ``E.T. The Extraterrestrial'' at
$399.8 million and ``Jurassic Park'' at $356.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of the pack, Universal's ``Notting Hill''
continued to post respectable numbers in sixth place for the
weekend with $5.1 million at 2,559 theaters followed by the
studio's eighth weekend of ``The Mummy,'' taking in $2.1 million at
1,826 sites to reach $146 million so far, and Disney's fourth
weekend of ``Instinct'' with $1.9 million at 1,826 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's expanded run of romantic comedy ``An Ideal Husband,''
with Cate Blanchett and Minnie Driver, generated strong art-house
business to claim ninth place with $1.2 million at 122 theaters,
followed by Warner Bros.' 13th weekend of ``The Matrix'' with $1
million at 1,139 sites to go past $165 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fourth of July holiday on customers' minds this week,
studios will open two major entries Wednesday: Warner's ``Wild Wild
West'' with Will Smith and Paramount's ``South Park.'' Bucksbaum
said ``Wild Wild West'' should lead the box office next weekend,
one of the year's heaviest moviegoing periods.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that studios plan to pick up the pace of new
releases during July and August after opening fewer than usual
during May and June to avoid competition with Lucas' blockbuster.
``It's going to get very crowded fast,'' Bucksbaum added.
</P>
<P>
   Final totals for the Friday-Sunday period will be released
today.

DODGERS FALL TO GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Los Angeles Dodgers might have talent
waiting to burst out, but they've earned the distinction of being
the worst team in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   They won two of three against San Francisco, but they returned
to LAX on Sunday night in last place after dropping the finale of a
three-game series 8-7 to the Giants at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Dodgers (34-39) won the first two games of this
series, their June record stands at 9-14 and they haven't won three
consecutive games for two months. They've lost 13 of 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last place, 7{ games out,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``I don't care what everyone is doing. I care what we're
doing. We're trying to get our act together here.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego, winners of nine straight, leaped-frogged the Dodgers
with their win earlier in the day against Colorado. It's the first
time the Dodgers have been in last place since April 24, 1996. They
trail the Padres by a half-game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of days ago we were eight games out in the loss
column,'' Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros said. ``Hell, we picked
up a game. This series we played as well a series as we've played
all year, against a tough team in a tough ballpark. That's the way
you have to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   True, the Dodgers played their best series possibly since
beginning the season with a sweep of Arizona, but they remain
inconsistent. A day after an emotional win that could jump-start a
winning streak, the pitching sputtered. Particularly starter Chan
Ho Park, who lasted less than four innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan Ho Park, he's got to pick it up,'' Johnson said. ``It
wasn't very good pitching, especially by Chan Ho.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers rallied for four runs in the seventh inning _ three
via Gary Sheffield's 16th homer _ but it did nothing to offset
Park's outing.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who was predicted by many to have a breakout season and
challenge the 20-win plateau, was battered for six runs in his
second-shortest outing of the season. He lasted 32/3 innings and
could have showered, walked to the airport and flown back to L.A.
by the time this 3-hour, 36-minute marathon ended.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Park didn't move from his locker after the game,
staring into it and declining comment.
</P>
<P>
   Park (4-6) walked four and allowed two more homers, the 18th and
19th of the season, in a span of three pitches. J.T. Snow hit a
three-run homer to put the Giants ahead 4-0 in the third and Ellis
Burks made it back-to-back with a shot to center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for a couple of two-out RBI bloopers,'' Giants
manager Dusty Baker said after his squad's losing streak ended.
``Any time you're trying to break a losing streak, it's always
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip-side of what has been a season of one thing working
well, another poorly, is the offensive surge.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers averaged 2.8 runs on their last home stand, but have
scored 14 runs and accumulated 27 hits in the past two games. Part
of that is catcher Todd Hundley's moving to second in the order,
and hitting well. He followed up his two-run homer Saturday with
two hits Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield hit the homer in the seventh off reliever Jerry
Spradlin to draw the Dodgers close. But an inning later Giants
righty John Johnstone struck out Sheffield with the tying run stuck
on first and with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added a huge run in the bottom of the inning when
Brent Mayne's bloop double fell just out of the reach of a diving
Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gardner (2-6) yielded three runs in 61/3 innings for the
win. Rob Nen, who lost Saturday on Todd Hundley's three-run homer,
gave up a one-out solo homer to Todd Hollandsworth before getting
the final two outs for his 19th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of guys who played hard and played great,'' Baker
said. ``After a loss like (Saturday's), it reflects our character
big-time.''

PARK SHOWING NO SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The seven games of sitting and thinking, forced
by suspension, did nothing to improve Chan Ho Park's on-field
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to the rotation, the Los Angeles Dodgers
right-hander is 0-3 with an 8.47 ERA. The latest abomination came
in Sunday's 8-7 loss to the Giants at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson voiced his extreme
displeasure about Park's season-long performance, especially after
electing to leave Park in the game after the Dodgers scored twice
in the fourth to cut a five-run deficit to 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a lot more from Chan Ho,'' Johnson said. ``You're the
No. 2 starter, three runs down, go out there and hold them.
Otherwise, I would have pinch hit for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Park didn't make it out of the fourth inning, earning Johnson's
hook after allowing a one-out triple and a two-out RBI single. He
allowed six runs in 32/3 innings, walked four and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   It's the third time Park has allowed at least six earned runs in
a start, and second in the last three. In what was supposed to be a
breakout season, Park is 4-6 with a 5.54 ERA. He's allowed 19
homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like he was throwing the ball instead of pitching,''
Johnson said. ``I left him in hoping he'd be mad and go out there
and pitch. And he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a season of distraction and disaster for Park, who
declined to talk to the media.
</P>
<P>
   He has already tied a major-league record by allowing four grand
slams, was distracted by aborted contract talks and then released
his frustration by punching and kicking Angels pitcher Tim Belcher
in a fight earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to pitch the ball, and not throw the ball,'' catcher
Todd Hundley said. ``I can see it. When it's easy to see, you know
it's there. When you have a long swing, it's easy to see but you
don't feel it. Same thing with pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes he'll just try to overanalyse situations and
try to make the perfect pitch and then it's 2-0, 3-1, and a hitter
doesn't have to protect the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   White scratched late: Johnson just finished talking about how
much he liked his lineup because he alternated right-handed hitters
with left-handed hitters when he learned center fielder Devon White
couldn't play because of a stiff neck.
</P>
<P>
   The initial intention was to give Gary Sheffield the day off and
play Todd Hollandsworth in left. Instead, Hollandsworth started in
center and Sheffield played left.
</P>
<P>
   Mills mulls outing: Dodgers reliever Alan Mills gave up three
runs in the eighth inning in Saturday's win, including an Ellis
Burks homer to give the Giants a short-lived lead, which didn't sit
well with him. But Mills was bothered more by costing starter
Carlos Perez the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel bad about getting hit and giving up runs. That's
going to happen,'' said Mills, who had allowed one run in his
pervious eight outings. ``I feel bad for Carlos. He threw the ball
well and he deserved to win. That's what I feel bad about.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Johnson said he will keep right-hander Kevin Brown working
every five days, which means Brown will start Wednesday in San
Diego. Ismael Valdes opens the series Tuesday for the Dodgers and
Darren Dreifort will close it Thursday. Johnson said he was
concerned about Brown, who felt a twinge in his non-pitching
shoulder during his Friday start. Johnson said Brown has been
seeing a chiropractor and getting massages to ease the pain. Brown
said he'll be fine.... Giants outfielder Barry Bonds tied a
major-league record when he was intentionally walked in the fourth
inning. It was the 293rd time of his career, tying Hank Aaron....
The Dodgers have scored twice (three runs) in the first inning in
23 games in June while opponents have scored 10 times (16 runs) in
the opening inning.

ANGELS SWEEP UP A'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels didn't need a late-inning
rally to beat the Oakland A's Sunday night. They got all the runs
they needed in the first and cruised to a 4-3 win before 31,782 at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The victory capped a three-game sweep of the A's and helped the
Angels gain precious ground in the AL West standings as the
first-place Texas Rangers were defeated 5-2 by the Seattle Mariners
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will be in Anaheim tonight for the start of a
crucial three-game series that could affect the balance of the
season. The last time the two teams met, Anaheim took three games
of a four-game series at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I keep stressing right now is that we've got to win
two out of every three games,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said
after Sunday's game. ``If we keep winning like this we'll get back
in the hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Steve Sparks (3-5) got the win. He went five-plus
innings, giving up in against No. 10 four hits and two runs, both
of which were earned. Kenny Rogers took the loss for the A's. He
went the distance, giving up 12 hits and four runs while walking
one and striking out three.
</P>
<P>
   After winning three games in a row with late-inning rallies,
Anaheim nearly found itself on the wrong side of a comeback. Up 4-2
going into the ninth, manager Terry Collins brought in closer Troy
Percival.
</P>
<P>
   The first batter Percival faced was Tim Raines, pinch hitting
for Ryan Christenson. Raines doubled, then stole third. Olmedo
Saenz, pinch hitting for A.J Hinch, drove Raines home with a single
to make the score 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   With pinch-runner Jorge Velandia holding at first, Percival got
Tony Phillips to fly out. He struck out Miguel Tejada for out
number two, then blew two strikes past Ben Greive. With the crowd
standing in anticipation and the count even at 2-2, Grieve popped
up to Darin Erstad in left to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still held on and that's all that matters,'' Collins said.
``Velocity-wise, that's the best I've seen Percival this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, we really hung together after a good
first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in the first inning that the Angels took charge and won
the game. Leadoff man Darin Erstad started a four-run rally with
his triple to the corner in right field. Randy Velarde followed him
to the plate and drove Erstad in with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, batting in his usual third spot, smacked a single and
sent Velarde to third. Velarde came home when Todd Greene snapped
an 0-15 slump with a one-base hit of his own. Garret Anderson was
the fifth straight Angel to get a hit off Rogers. He singled to
bring home a sprinting Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was catcher Steve Decker who grounded into a double
play. He picked up an RBI when Greene came home. Glaus got the
sixth hit of the inning, a single, but was left on base when Reggie
Williams struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson got his third hit of the night, a double down the
right-field line in the seventh. He reached third on Steve Decker's
sacrifice fly, but didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   The A's first run came in the fourth when Matt Stairs tagged a
Sparks knuckleball for a 388-foot homer run to right.
</P>
<P>
   Their next run came in the sixth. Sparks loaded the bases,
walking three consecutive batters. Collins pulled Sparks and
brought in reliever Mark Petkovsek. Ryan Christenson sacrificed
John Jaha home for the run and Petkovsek worked his way out of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (Petkovsek's performance) was the ballgame,''
Collins said. ``That was it right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks walked six and struck out two. He threw 117 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was Sparks' seventh career appearance and fifth
start against the A's. In his last start against Oakland, Sparks
surrendered three runs in the first inning. In that loss he allowed
seven hits, all singles.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek threw three innings in relief and gave up one hit.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, batting .375 in the series, had three hits in four
at-bats Sunday night. He turned in a similar performance Saturday
night and singled home the winning run in the seventh inning of
that game. He's gotten hits in seven of the Angels' past eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's swinging the bat good he can hit anybody,'' Collins
said. ``Hopefully, he'll stay hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn and Velarde each had two hits. Vaughn singled in the
first and seventh innings off Rogers. Velarde's hits came in the
first and fourth innings.

`CODED' BANK ACCOUNT NUMBERS STIR FIGHT OVER MARKETING SUCH
INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE HADLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Olympia-based Heritage Bank gave the names, bank
account numbers and addresses of its customers to another company
that then used the information to try to sell the customers
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Benefit Consultants Inc., encrypted each bank
account number in a way it thought would not be identifiable
without a special code.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem: Albert Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, a Heritage Bank customer, received one of the insurance
solicitations. The letter said that if he wanted the insurance, the
company could automatically deduct the cost from his bank account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `How in the Sam Hill could they do that?'''
</P>
<P>
   He soon found out. Examining the insurance solicitation, he
noticed a code in an upper corner. The combination of letters and
numbers seemed odd yet familiar. Drawing on his World War II
cryptography training, Newman, 79, quickly decoded the information
to discover that it was his bank account number.
</P>
<P>
   He was outraged. Newman, who had more than $100,000 in the bank,
began writing letters to the bank, telling it not to give his
account number and other information to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his objections, the mailings continued.
</P>
<P>
   After more than three years of continued solicitations, Newman
finally sued Heritage Bank. The mailings stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Newman has agreed to testify at a July 29 hearing called by the
Washinton state Senate's Commerce, Trade, Housing and Financial
Institutions Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairwoman Sen. Margarita Prentice, D-Seattle, said
she decided to call the hearing because she's concerned about the
increasing reports of banks disclosing customers' account
information to marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really violating that kind of trust relationship we're
supposed to have with our financial institutions,'' she said.
``Banks are built on trust. They've violated this trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Also planning to testify July 29 is John Bley, director of
financial institutions for the state. After Minnesota's attorney
general announced a lawsuit against US Bank for allegedly selling
customer information to a telemarketing firm earlier this month,
Bley's office got more than 100 calls from Washington citizens with
similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``To receive that many was certainly out of the ordinary,'' Bley
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the debate in Congress over new banking privacy
legislation has boiled down to the question of whether the bank
owns customer information or whether the customer owns the
information. Legislation that assumes the bank owns it puts the
burden on the consumer to tell the bank not to give away or sell
the information. Those who believe the customer owns it say the
bank must get the customer's explicit permission before disclosing
the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think most people would say, `No, that's my
information,''' Bley said. Yet that position is treated as
``extreme'' in Congress right now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it such an extreme position that federal law ought to
protect the reasonable privacy expectations of its citizens?'' Bley
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., has introduced banking-privacy
legislation that would put the burden on the consumer to object.
Inslee said he would prefer the legislation put the burden on the
banks to get permission, but he had to compromise to win support
for his bill from moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Inslee also plans to testify at the July 29 hearing in Olympia.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Paula Selis, who is investigating
BrandDirect Marketing, is also expected to testify at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Bley said banks use the questionable tactics because they're in
``a highly competitive industry in a securities market that demands
maximum return.'' Bank executives might be loathe to resort to
disclosing account information, ``but the securities market tells
financial institutions if you're not going to maximize return,
you're going to be subject to hostile takeover, and management will
be put in place to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Heritage Bank declined to comment on Newman's suit because it is
in litigation. But letters from bank attorneys to Newman's Olympia
attorney, Shawn Newman (no relation), contend that the bank is
providing the account information to Benefit Consultants merely to
``assist the bank in communicating with its customers.''
</P>
<P>
   That is proper and not a violation of Albert Newman's rights,
wrote Heritage attorney William Holt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems basic that Heritage has the right to communicate with
its customers. It can do this through its own employees or through
independent contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shawn Newman said this was not communication between
Heritage and Albert Newman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hired independent contractors to solicit their bank
customers to purchase insurance. This is not an internal deal,''
Shawn Newman said. ``This came from Trumbull, Connecticut. These
are independent contractors that are soliciting for the Insurance
Company of North America.''
</P>
<P>
   The solicitation invited Albert Newman to fill out an
``application to Insurance Company of North America for accidental
death and dismemberment insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The solicitation included a letter signed by Heritage Chairman
Donald Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage recently offered Albert Newman money to settle the
suit, but Albert Newman said he turned it down because it would
have required him not to discuss the suit or his complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said far from wanting to ``shut my mouth'' about his
experience, he wants to shout it from the mountain top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the public to know what the banks are doing to them and
the fact that they're so arrogant that if you question them, they
say get lost.''
</P>
<P>
   In the field artillery during World War II, Newman said his unit
was given instruction in cryptography so they could decipher and
encode messages. A common technique then was to use letters to
stand for numbers and vice versa, he said. Benefit Consultant's
code was simple to break, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who ran a boat repair yard in Vallejo, Calif., before he
retired, also wants to be compensated for the $5,000 or $6,000 in
lost interest he incurred in transferring his funds out of the bank
and for his legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to hire an attorney to shut it off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once someone has your bank account number, they can find out
many other things about you, including the amount of money in your
account, both Albert and Shawn Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Summary judgment motions in the case are to be heard in Thurston
County Superior Court Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, the bank's stated policy said the bank
would disclose Newman's account information to third parties only
where necessary to complete transfers, to verify the existence and
condition of his account for a third party such as credit bureau or
merchant, or to comply with court orders. Also, information could
be disclosed if he gave permission or if his account was closed for
abuse or because he owed the bank money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says there you're in safe haven. They don't tell you that
for a couple of bucks they'll sell everything about you,'' Albert
Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank maintains it does not sell any account information but
refused to be questioned on the assertion. Shawn Newman said the
bank may technically not be paid specifically for the information,
but undoubtedly receives some form of commission for insurance
sales that result from the solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   Another bank attorney wrote Shawn Newman that generally the bank
does not provide its customer list or account numbers to third
parties, but on occasion the bank has ``an opportunity to offer
services to its customers through third-party providers.'' In
another letter, Rhodes, the Heritage chairman, wrote that more than
2,000 customers signed up for the insurance, causing the bank to
believe that its customers valued the service.
</P>
<P>
   The first $1,000 of coverage is provided free; customers pay for
any additional coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's lawsuit alleges that the bank's disclosure of his
account information was a breach of contract, negligent, an
invasion of privacy and violated the state's Consumer Protection
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Walsh, a professor of tort law at the University of
Washington, said he thinks many juries might well decide against
the bank on most of these points.
</P>
<P>
   Most customers would want to be ``clearly alerted'' to the
possibility that the bank would disclose their account information
to a third party, Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinctive sense is that a lot of people really would find
this offensive,'' he said.

MARINERS FANS HEAD OUTDOORS ALL WARM INSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A funny thing happened on the way to the Kingdome
Sunday, before Ken Griffey Jr. cranked a big-moment homer, before a
pink-skinned streaker gamboled across the outfield and before sweet
Edgar Martinez got tossed for arguing balls and strikes:
</P>
<P>
   It got sunny.
</P>
<P>
   The clouds broke apart and the sky turned mostly blue.
</P>
<P>
   A historic Seattle morning that started off as thick and gray
and baleful as, well, the Kingdome ceiling blossomed into a
wonderful early summer Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect day for a game outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Let's call it an omen.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to the Kingdome _ which after 22{ seasons marked its
baseball finale Sunday with a packed house, special guests and a
stream of videotaped memories _ but Seattle has done the right
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The future looks bright. The future has atmosphere. It has a
different set of sounds, smells and energy _ the kind that make it
possible for baseball to really seep into your soul, from April to
October, 81 times a season.
</P>
<P>
   Although baseball has no future in the Kingdome, it owes its
future here completely to the Kingdome. The Dome is the reason
baseball is here. It is where 32 million spectators got a look at
the game and its players _ the good ones, the bad ones, the
greatest ones, like Griffey, and our favorites, like Edgar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little sad,'' Martinez said. ``When I came to the
stadium, there were a lot of people walking around. It felt like a
playoff game, and it made you realize it was the last game. We're
sad, but at the same time, we're looking forward to the new
stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obscene half-billion dollar cost and the disastrous
politics, and even in spite of the end run that Mariner owners are
now making to garner $60 million in excess tax revenue to help pay
for the $100 million in cost overruns, Seattle has what it needs to
make baseball what it should be.
</P>
<P>
   As Mariners pitcher Freddy Garcia threw the first pitch to the
Rangers just a little after 1:35 p.m., I walked around the outside
of the Kingdome to where the new, controversial, pricey and
enticing outdoor designer ballpark sits, waiting.
</P>
<P>
   And even as the Kingdome celebrated its, shall we say
interesting, baseball legacy, I could not help but think the switch
from baseball indoors to baseball outside was coming not a minute
too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the sun, seagulls were flying around, squawking. The
heavenly scent of grilled hot dogs infused the air.
</P>
<P>
   The crackle of the Mariners radio broadcast was amplified
through speakers outside the Kingdome, and it mingled with sounds
of traffic and the stir of the monstrous crowd that was still
snaking its way into the old concrete Dome.
</P>
<P>
   And the overwhelming feeling was: What an oddity. Going inside
just as the day outside turned ideal.
</P>
<P>
   But at least this would be the very last time. This quirky
Northwest ritual is over now.
</P>
<P>
   That is why so many people showed up for the Mariners' final
Kingdome game _ the first sellout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they did the wave with zeal. That's why they sang
``Louie, Louie'' so joyously during the seventh-inning stretch.
That's why they cheered for the almost-naked streaker, who was
handcuffed and escorted off the field as everyone laughed,
including the Mariner players and some of the cops.
</P>
<P>
   The finale was a party as much as it was a goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much overwhelming nostalgia or teary sentiment that
prompted the 56,530 to take a seat in the Dome, even as 300-game
winner Gaylord Perry was applauded and Alvin Davis was lauded for
his place as Mr. Mariner and Harold Reynolds was saluted for all
those plays.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout was the pull to be part of history, since the
Kingdome has just become baseball history in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The farewell hype was designed to stir up sentimentality in us,
but as it turns out, the most stirring thing about the day was
Griffey, not the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Griffey hit the home run that anyone who
knows Griffey knew he would hit.
</P>
<P>
   With his father Ken Sr. in the house and son Trey there, too,
Griffey is as much if not more baseball history here than the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's uncanny flair for making the big moments even better
all but guaranteed his theatrics. That included the sensational
wall-climbing, homer-saving catch in straightaway center that
Griffey made, saving three runs.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to the Kingdome, but Ken Griffey will still be Ken
Griffey in Safeco Field, even if Mariner hitters are concerned
about the outdoor park's larger dimensions and the heavier air _ so
much different than the outdated band box called the Kingdome,
whose time and place on the Seattle skyline has come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   No one was found sobbing inside the Kingdome. Joey Cora was
nowhere to be found, except in the video montage.
</P>
<P>
   Cora might be the last man who ever out and out cried in the
Kingdome. His breakdown in the dugout after the Mariners lost the
1995 American League Championship Series to Cleveland is a
crystalline Kingdome memory that will never go away.
</P>
<P>
   But we will.
</P>
<P>
   We're ready to walk down the street to the new era of outdoor
baseball in the new ballpark, the sun on our backs.

M'S LEAVE KINGDOME IN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The ball was in another glove for an instant, just
long enough for Brian Hunter to catch it and flip it to the place
it belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer's fly, the one that retired baseball at the only
home the Mariners have known, landed in the webbing of Ken Griffey
Jr.'s mitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his show,'' said Hunter, the Mariners' left fielder. ``He
won't admit it, but I feel that way. So I just wanted to give him
the last ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were shut out when they christened the Kingdome in
1977, one of those years that was all but over by opening day. They
won Sunday, as a sold-out crowd of 56,530 saw them gain a game on
the division-leading Texas Rangers with a 5-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   These games matter more. These Mariners have a chance. More than
anyone else, Griffey is responsible for that.
</P>
<P>
   The center fielder hit the final homer in the Kingdome, a
three-run shot in the first inning. He took away a three-run homer
in the fourth, climbing the wall in left-center field and reaching
over to keep Juan Gonzalez in.
</P>
<P>
   Two final jolts to a place Griffey wired when he moved here as a
teenager. On July 15, it's on to Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 11 years,'' Griffey said. ``It's like if you
move out of your home, you're going to miss that. I know all the
ins and outs of this ballpark. I'll have to figure it out next
door. They're sending me a blueprint of the new place so I can
sneak in and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey doesn't sneak out of places. Not when he's on his way to
his 10th Gold Glove. Not when his next homer will start him on the
second half of his pursuit of Hank Aaron's record 755. Not with his
singular ability to make the moment his.
</P>
<P>
   Leaping to a new building with a single bound was only so
typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I've known him, whether it's the All-Star Game, a
big game, a national TV game, he's always done it _ always,'' said
Harold Reynolds, the Mariners' second baseman for Griffey's first
four years. ``That's just Junior. We used to joke about it _
`Uh-oh, he's got his cape on again.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior's done it his whole career,'' said designated hitter
Edgar Martinez, Griffey's teammate from the start. ``He rises to
the occasion, and it wasn't any different today.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey insisted he doesn't handle big games differently. He
went hitless in the one-game playoff with the Angels in 1995, he
reminded reporters. His approach is simple: ``If it goes out, it
goes out. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Make the catch. That's it.
Don't show emotion and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's home run? As Griffey nonchalantly told Dave Niehaus on
the podium during postgame ceremonies, he was just trying to get
the runners over.
</P>
<P>
   To say he changes when the red light glows would be to imply a
lesser effort when it doesn't. It's the same effort every day,
Griffey said, and it may be that his ability to maintain that
approach, no matter the circumstance, gives him an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just settles down and becomes very calm,'' said his father,
Ken Sr., one of a dozen or more ex-Mariners on hand Sunday. ``I
tried to teach him that scenario, about blocking out everything but
him and the pitcher. But there's some things you can't teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's homer erased the two-run shot Greer hit off Freddy
Garcia in the top of the first. Garcia (9-4) then loaded the bases
on a walk, a double and an intentional walk, but ended the inning
by getting a ground out.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie right-hander followed with four scoreless innings,
and Frankie Rodriguez and Jose Mesa added four more. Griffey's
homer in the bottom of the inning, his 198th at the Kingdome and
201st including the postseason, was all the M's needed.
</P>
<P>
   That, and his catch in the fourth. Gonzalez, whose two MVP
awards bookend the one Griffey won in 1997, came up with two outs
and two on. He had been fooled by Garcia's change-up in striking
out his first two at-bats, but unloaded on a change-up this time.
Griffey raced back, planted his right spikes in the padded wall,
and grabbed it, holding the ball high as he began his trot in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when he plays,'' Garcia said, ``anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey returned to the bench and took a seat next to rookie
Charles Gipson. Gipson, who said he often calls his father to rave
about playing with Griffey, tried to share his excitement over the
catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Griffey said. ``But we've still got some game left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He does it so much, it's second nature,'' Gipson said. ``Most
players would be like a little kid and get all excited. He's like,
`Let's just keep on playing.' Amazing. Amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is all done playing in the Kingdome. But the memories,
of him and especially the team he helped raise to contenders, will
always amaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came over when it was still a little bit empty over here,
and we were losing some years twice as much as we were winning,''
said right fielder Jay Buhner, an 11-year Mariner. ``But now, to
build what we've built here, a winning tradition and a winning
mind-set, and to be able to transfer that next door, that's pretty
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   And there will be more building to do at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start a new tradition over there, hang up some banners,''
Griffey said. ``Some big ones, not the ones that say `division
title' _ the ones that say `World Series.' ''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Movie industry embraces urinals
 &HT;    (For release June 30, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the president and seemingly everyone else is down on the
motion picture industry for its embrace of violence and sex, I find
myself on a different page. What troubles me most about films these
days is, simply, bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   About the only Oscar that the latest Austin Powers movie ever
could attain would be if they were giving one out for bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   The insipid film (no, I have not seen it _ and will not _ but
have seen enough of it on TV to know how crude it is) asks
questions of moviegoers: Are you obtuse enough to call this
entertainment? Did you walk into the theater by accident, thought
you were going to see something intelligent in the auditorium next
door? Are things so bad at home that you need to see something
totally stupid to take your mind off the ballooning second
mortgage? Did you not understand the most recent ``Star Wars''
film, and so thought to find something easier to comprehend?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is nothing wrong with being entertained by
stupidity. Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, the Three Stooges
and Jerry Lewis had long Hollywood careers being slapstick moronic,
but this Austin Powers character, he's not as clever as his
predecessors because, unlike them, he needs to inject bathroom
humor into the film.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly, every click of the TV remote finds Mike Myers, who
co-produced, co-wrote and starred in ``The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' on
another talk program, throwing out his phrases and definitions, as
a susceptible audience of mostly teenagers embarks on a second
language.
</P>
<P>
   So taken have people become with this crude entertainment that a
Web site was established by New Line Cinema, distributors of the
film, whereby you may purchase Austin Powers-related items such as
a penis enlarger, various party packs, T-shirts and martini and
shot glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the film's distributors _ not content with all the
sordid phraseology already circulated _ went a step further and
tried to outgross another film I have not seen (ask me about ``Tea
With Mussolini,'' though) by copying its advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion of ``Big Daddy'' has, as the graphic in its large
newspaper ads, a man and a boy urinating against a brick wall. This
is supposed to capture our goofy attention. Most bizzarely, it has
become film-fashionable to include men urinating. (This act is not
reserved for stupid comedies; in dramas, cross-talking criminals
devise new schemes also while addressing the urinal. Real guys stop
their cars along deserted highways and walk 10 yards away to
relieve themselves against a bush.)
</P>
<P>
   This act is competing well with the male-cherished slipping bra
strap, although I cannot believe that female viewers get any thrill
out of seeing men urinating.
</P>
<P>
   In last Sunday's major newspapers, instead of the toothy,
grinning face of Austin Powers in ads for that film, we find a
grown man and a height-impaired person in the exact pose as the
``Big Daddy'' display ad, urinating against a brick wall. No one,
it seems, has a copyright on bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   If all the film has to sell is a scene like that, what does that
say about the rest of the movie?
</P>
<P>
   I never could understand the accolades heaped on ``Something
About Mary'' last year. It was, to me, a most offensive film using
the most disgusting sight gags I'd ever seen in a movie.
</P>

   Mind you, I'm not speaking as a moralist. There is a difference
between morality and bad taste. Films the moralists condemn cover a
wide range: sex, abuse toward religion, innuendoes _ gross
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Bad taste films send a different message: bad taste.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Imprisoned Jews are pawns of Iranian politics
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can believe, if you wish, that Israel would put Iran's
remnant Jewish community at high risk by recruiting spies wholesale
from its ranks. And that, for some odd reason, it would favor
provincial religious teachers and students for the task.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can suspect, with far better reason, that the 13 Iranian
Jews imprisoned as alleged spies are pawns in the dead-earnest
power struggle between elected moderate President Mohammed Khatami
and radical Islamist clergy hellbent on preserving the extremist
theocracy of the late, founding ayatollah, Ruhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   Officially a ``tolerated minority'' in 90-percent Shiite Muslim
Iran, the 27,000 Jews who remain, essentially trapped, out of a
onetime population of 100,000 are in fact, like Baha'is,
evangelical Christians and others in that begrudged status, in
fragile circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Popularly elected two years ago, Khatami advanced his
breakthrough early this year by virtually sweeping the Islamic
republic's first local elections. Khatami allies took 70 percent of
the vote nationally and won 12 of 15 seats on the Tehran city
council. Hardliners were aced out everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The results were striking enough to move the U.S. State
Department, never the fastest sprinter in the blocks, to
acknowledge, though with elaborate cautions, Khatami's attempts to
resume contacts with the West.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely that prospect that alarms Iran's revolutionary
clerics, and what better counter than that old reliable ploy in
intra-Islamic one-upmanship, the Zionist conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the recent clamor against the 13, after months of official
silence. Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi, head of Iranian courts, told
worshipers at prayers recently that the Jews must be tried under
Islamic law and could be sentenced to death ``several times.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not an idle threat. Iran executes casually, even
whimsically.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty obviously, the game here has less to do with espionage
than with Iranian politics. Just by making the charge, the
hardliners put Khatami and his followers in position to be called
pro-Zionist if they come to the prisoners' defense.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the same potential slander neutralizes other
Islamic countries. Saudi Arabia, for instance, very much wants
Iran's extremists boxed, but as the defender of the faith it will
hold back from supporting Khatami if he is cast as a Zionist
sympathizer, however absurd the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has protested the arrests (the 13 were at first also
charged with spying for the ``big devil'' _ that's us, of course)
and so has the European Union, led by Germany. France dressed down
the Iranian ambassador, to no apparent avail. Human rights
organizations have been barred from visiting the prisoners, an
additionally worrisome sign.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of this affair will say a good bit about which way
Iran is trending, but other nations cannot afford to look on with
only academic interest. International success in preventing the
trials also would bolster Iranian moderation. Only the region's
terrorists and their political groupies can want otherwise.

 &HT;    Global gap in preparedness
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The world is a better place than it was just this past
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least better prepared to fight the Year 2000 computer
flaw, commonly called the Y2K bug. Last week, more than 170 nations
sent delegates to a conference at the United Nations headquarters
in New York to assess worldwide plans for coping with the software
problem that will cause many computers, especially older ones, to
malfunction when the date changes to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The experts were optimistic about the enormous progress made in
recent months, saying the world's business and political leaders
are now focused on fixing the software needed to keep banks, power
companies, water providers and other utilities functioning smoothly
as the year changes from '99 to '00. ``Action is under way
everywhere, by and large according to schedule,'' declared
Pakistan's U.N. Ambassador Ahmad Kamal, who chairs the U.N. working
group dealing with Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Still, reports coming out of the conference suggest that
progress remains wildly uneven, with developed countries in far
better shape than less wealthy countries, especially those in Latin
America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Because so much emphasis has been put on preparing banks and
nuclear power plants, those sectors should do reasonably well
worldwide. But smaller countries continue to have serious problems
with key industries such as shipping, health care and oil
exporting. Island nations that rely heavily on tourism worry that a
fear of flying in early January will keep many travelers home.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, politics are impeding progress on this
technological problem.
</P>
<P>
   For example, North African and Middle Eastern nations refused to
allow Israeli officials to join in a regional Y2K meeting at the
U.N. conference. ``The Y2K problem should break down boundaries and
barriers, and not create them,'' Israeli Ambassador Dore Gold told
the conference. ``Israel is prepared to share its expertise with
its neighbors ...''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his role as the U.N. leader on Y2K problems, Kamal
defended the snub of Israel. ``We can't force people to invite
people they don't want in their homes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural differences also play a role in how countries are
approaching the critical period from Dec. 31 to Jan. 2. In the
United States, some bankers are saying they will be working on
Saturday, Jan. 1, rather than enjoying a routine weekend holiday.
They want to keep the doors open and lights on to show how
confident they are about their bank's transition to the new year.
</P>
<P>
   But at least 20 other countries around the world have declared
Dec. 31 a bank holiday, closing their financial institutions Friday
so that employees will have more time to complete back-up plans for
possible Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jane Garvey, head of the Federal Aviation
Administration, has announced she'll be taking a midnight flight to
demonstrate confidence in air safety, Vietnam Airlines already has
thrown in the towel and canceled domestic and international flights
that would be in progress at midnight Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Venezuela, Y2K is turning out to be a boon to
shrinks. Hugo Castellanos, head of the government's Y2K task force,
told U.N. conference attendees that Venezuela is trying to psych
out the software bug. ``We're talking to psychologists and
psychiatrists about how to reach people in the right way'' to avoid
panic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no two countries did a better job at the U.N
conference of displaying their national character and role in the
global community than Yugoslavia and North Korea. Their chairs were
empty.

   COMMENTARY: New $20s incite political backlash
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Lane
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Every so often a political issue appears
from nowhere. It is handed to a politician like Excalibur rising
from the lake. Find it and you're on TV with talking heads nodding
in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Could the conservative backlash against the new $20 bill be such
an issue? The $50 and $100 redesigns affected only big spenders.
But the $20 hits close to the ATM.
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame Steve Forbes for giving it a road test. Watching
his spiel on the flat tax fall flatter than the blue line you see
here which represents the maximum rate of taxation on earned
income, Forbes was desperately casting about for something new.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lamar Alexander and Dan Quayle, Forbes has a presidential
campaign teetering on the edge of becoming a throwaway line on
David Letterman's Top 10 List. (``Top 10 Organizations that could
do a better job managing the Mets: ... No. 5 _ The Yugoslav Air
Force; No. 4 _ The Forbes Campaign; No. 3 ...'' )
</P>
<P>
   It's a fate candidates lie awake at night contemplating.
</P>
<P>
   There were too many right-wing candidates for president for any
candidate to get noticed by threatening to punish somebody new.
(``If elected, I will move immediately to arrest all the
Teletubbies!'')
</P>
<P>
   The boring middle, the moralistic right and the kinder and
gentler left all have been taken up by what people believe George
W. Bush might say when that glorious day arrives for him to say
something specific.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone running for the Republican nomination already wants
more missiles, lower taxes and to make kids stand up straight, pray
before class and stop being so snotty.
</P>
<P>
   How is someone supposed to stand out?
</P>
<P>
   The only way to break out from pack is to find a brand new issue
and jump on it feet first.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators say such issues ``fly under the radar.'' The
pollsters can't spot them. They can only be chased like fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, then, went chasing and found the answer was right there
in his wallet _ as so many answers are for multimillionaires.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 bill. You can almost hear how the inspiration crept up
on him:
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that sorry thing, will you? That grossly oversized
Jackson _ a Democrat! _ staring up at you with those nasty crazed
eyes that follow you every time the ATM spits out cash. It's wrong.
Not like the old $20s. The old bills had dignity, proportion and a
nice view of a Clintonless White House. But these new things.
Numbers without serifs. Looks European or something. Looks like
that stupid moose-money they spend up in Canada. Hey-y-y ...''
</P>
<P>
   An idea was born.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes hit the trail in Iowa damning bills that ``look like
Monopoly money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that's going to change if a certain person is
elected president. We'll have money that looks real again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A new issue was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Money that looks real again. Certainly a slogan to conjure with.
No pocketbook issue could be easier to grasp, to visualize. It asks
us to hearken back to a time when men were men, women were women
and $20 bills looked like $20 bills.
</P>
<P>
   This could be easily broadened to a cry for cars that look like
real cars, offices that look like real offices and restaurants that
serve food that looks like real food.
</P>
<P>
   For our kids to start looking like real kids and wear shoes that
look like real shoes. For beer that tastes real again. And chicken
that tastes real in every real-looking pot.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are asked to absorb crazy amounts of change. And for
that reason, we get cranky over small things. Like blue M&AMP;Ms. Like
learning new area codes. Like not being given the option of paper
bags at the supermarket. Like $20 bills that have numbers in a
Hershey-bar typeface.
</P>
<P>
   Money that looks like money. It sounds dumb, but to change-weary
Americans it might be just dumb enough to strike a chord.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someone will push for a constitutional amendment. It's a
bad week, indeed, when the House of Representatives doesn't get
around to passing another new amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But, then again, that could create even more change, which
wouldn't be in the spirit of this issue. Maybe this is something
best left alone.

 &HT;    It's a different world in Miami
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI, Fla. _ ``Let me tell you about the very rich. They are
different from you and me.'' F. Scott Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen.'' E. Elizabeth Schuett.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Miami, my old home town, a sun-drenched world of
conspicuous consumption, where if the local marina can't come up
with a dock large enough to accommodate your new 70-foot yacht, you
simply buy a $7 million waterfront home and float your own boat.
True story.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon I saw a little league team in a swanky-looking van
pull into Baskin-Robbins for an after-game treat. I commented on
the pretty truck to my friend Jeanne. ``Pretty expensive
transportation,'' she said. ``It's a Mercedes SUV.'' When she told
me what it cost, I almost lost my yogurt and watched uneasily as
the team scrambled back in with their 31 flavors of potential
disaster in hand, and wondered if I was the only one worrying about
the upholstery.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when I'd had time to think about it, I figured it's kind
of like the old boat thing _ if you have to ask how much, you
obviously can't afford it, and if you're going to worry about
Junior slopping his chocolate-mint ripple on the custom upholstery,
you shoulda' bought a used pickup.
</P>
<P>
   One stoplight and a grocery store pretty much describes
Gibsonburg, the farm village in northwest Ohio that I have called
home for the past 16 years. Most of our houses have garages, some
are even attached, but nobody has a dock. The nearest body of water
is an abandoned lime quarry on the outskirts of town, and our idea
of a luxury car is one that will crank even when it's 20-below.
Kids still ride bikes to the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald was right. The rich really (SET ITAL)are(END ITAL)
different from the rest of us and one muggy Miami afternoon, I
figured it out.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne maneuvered us into a parking place just outside a ``must
see'' used clothing shop in Coconut Grove. I wasn't so sure I
wanted to look at a bunch of dresses somebody else had already
worn. ``Bleeck!'' was my astute comment. ``It'll probably stink in
there.'' Jeanne assured me it was well worth the visit and that the
``stinking rich'' really didn't smell bad. She said most of the
clothes had only been worn once anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne had to ring a bell to get us in. I asked why. She said
she wasn't sure but thought it was probably to keep out the
undesirables. From the way the clerk was eyeballing me, I figured
maybe that was us. She watched closely as we fingered our way
through a rack of designer labels and bugle beads. Suspecting she
could size up our Dun &AMP; Bradstreet from idle chatter, I muttered
something about dining with Buffy and Bippy since it was cook's
night out. Jeanne snickered.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when I asked the world's all-time most stupid
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is everything a size 4?'' The world-weary clerk stared in
disbelief and asked me if I was from out of town. When I failed to
come up with the right answer, she humored me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Madam wishes,'' she oozed, ``we have zeroes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look, lady,'' I said, spreading my arms for closer
inspection, ``does this body look like a zero to you?'' Rigorous
training prevented her from answering but I kept going. ``Where do
these clothes come from, anyway? The Betty Ford Clinic?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Palm Beach,'' Miss Congeniality sniffed as if she needn't
explain any further. She needn't. I asked what rich women eat.
``Practically nothing,'' Jeanne whispered. I suggested that was
because they were spending the grocery money on designer dresses. I
told Jeanne I felt the need for hot fudge. We bugged out.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of disparities, and we were, have you read about
Columba Bush (the Florida governor's wife) who went on a little
shopping jaunt to Paris and tried to sneak $19,000 worth of clothes
and jewelry through U.S. Customs? Says she didn't want her husband
to know how much money she'd spent.
</P>
<P>
   Enough, already. Beam me home, Scotty, and back to reality.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to locate an official Texas Rangers badge for
friends in California who would like to wear it on a trail ride
celebrating their sesquicentennial. _ Don Sulak A: Don, Don, Don _
think about it for a minute. The first official Texas Ranger badge
was issued in 1935 and there have been three designs since then. In
1935 there were only 42 Rangers (107 currently). Not that many
badges out there. So the official badges tend to stay with the
Rangers or their families. I would be suspicious of the
authenticity of any purported badge at an auction. The current
style (circle star) first appeared in a design used by a Ranger
Detachment under Ira Aten, whose squad quelled the 1889
Jaybird-Woodpecker War in Fort Bend County. The Texas Ranger Museum
archivist suggests you pick up a replica badge from the museum gift
store in Waco. Call (254) 750-8631.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are having trouble with carpenter ants in our trees and
house. We cut back the trees and had a pest control company spray
the house. We need someone who can take care of the trees and the
house. _ Brenda T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Carpenter ants build nests in hollow trees and logs as well
as wood in homes. Unlike termites, the ants use the wood as a home,
not food. Entry points? Branches or utility lines touching a home,
window cracks, crevices, air conditioning ducts and attic
ventilation openings. The experts at the Texas Agricultural
Extension Service recommend that home owners identify colony
locations before treatment, replace decaying wood, repair plumbing
leaks, provide proper clearance between house and wood, remove
stumps and wood debris near the house and treat colonies within 100
feet of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was President Clinton's lottery number in the draft? Is
there a way to find out who had to go to Vietnam because he did
not? _ Henry M.
</P>
<P>
   A: No way to find out if someone went in an individual's place,
says Selective Service spokesman Lew Brodsky. President Clinton's
stint in the ROTC forestalled his induction in the armed services.
In the 1969 Selective Service Lottery, President' Clinton's
birthday, Aug. 19, was lucky _ No. 311. He and the other
registrants born between Jan. 1, 1944, and Dec. 31, 1950, were the
first to depart from the traditional method of induction call
(oldest men not yet 26). No. 1 in the 1969 lottery? Sept. 14.
Brodsky adds that when a draft is in operation, the most vulnerable
year for a young man to be drafted is the year he is 20 (out of
high school, usually not yet married and in good physical health).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you tell me the name of Hopalong Cassidy's horse? _
V.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Topper was the white steed of the black-and-white-clad
Hopalong (actor William Boyd). His sidekick? Red Conners played by
Edgar Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: For many years I have looked up at those monstrous water
towers and wondered about the millions of gallons of water just
sitting there and, well, looking not unlike my dog's water dish _
mossy and just plain yucky. Have you? _ David R. Compton
</P>
<P>
   A: Can't say that I have. Great mental picture, but incorrect.
The water in these towers meets drinking water standards. If you
climb up there, you can sip safely. Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission's Tom Kelley says the interiors of these
tower tanks are steel with an approved protective coating. The
water is checked regularly. Occasionally a tower tank water supply
will be the subject of complaints. Unprotected exterior painting of
the tower may toss paint chips and powder in the water. Yuck.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Gov. George W. Bush was re-elected to office and announced
his candidacy for president. Now that he is campaigning while in
office, what happens to his salary and what is the amount? _
Barbara Hatter
</P>
<P>
   A: The governor continues to earn his annual salary _
$115,344.96 _ while campaigning. When the governor is out of the
state for a complete calendar day (midnight to midnight), the
acting governor also receives a salary for that day, says spokesman
Scott McClellan. For example, if Bush is out of the state that full
calendar day, then Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, as acting governor,
receives $316.01 for that day, on top of his munificent annual
salary of $7,200.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some kids have told me that if you save 100 Tootsie Pop
wrappers with the Indian shooting an arrow with a star and send
them in you get a year of free Tootsie Pops. Please confirm or
deny. I am up to my ears in wrappers. _ Becky R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, Becky, there is no free Tootsie Pop. Toss the
wrappers. You are correct _ the wrapper with the star and Indian is
uncommon _ only about one in four are so marked. Chief Shooting
Star is the legendary inspiration for the chewy, Tootsie-centered
lollipops.

   First introduced in 1931, the Tootsie Pop, named for the
5-year-old daughter of maker Leo Hirshfield, has been the focus of
much research. Purdue University Engineering students modeled a
licking machine after a human tongue. With it the students
determined it takes an average of 364 licks to get to the chewy

<P>
   Q: Can you give me the name of the theme song for the television
program ``Providence''? Also, can I buy it? _ Tom Hutchins
</P>
<P>
   A: How soon we forget. ``In My Life'' (a Beatles hit) is sung by
Chantal Kreviazuk. I have not found the song on her albums, but the
tremendous popularity of this show leads me to suspect the
``Providence'' soundtrack can't be long in coming. (Remember the
``Northern Exposure'' phenomenon?)
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should I do? I was informed of someone trying to use my
Social Security number to get credit. Do I need a new Social
Security number? Can I even get a new number?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: Trouble in River City. Glad you were notified. Some people
only find out after credit is extended to the thief. Contact the
three major credit reporting bureaus immediately and have your
credit history flagged. You will be contacted before credit is
extended in your name: Equifax at (800) 525-6285; Trans Union at
(800) 680-7289; and Experian at (800) 301-7195. If you are still
disadvantaged by the misuse of your number after these agencies
have been contacted, a new Social Security number may be assigned
to you. Then you must report the changed number everywhere you do
business. Of course there is no guarantee, says Social Security's
Sandra Talbot, that the new number will not fall into the wrong
hands. Please be careful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a 30-year-old male with thinning hair. I am not the kind
of guy who looks good in a hat, so my scalp just keeps getting
sunburnt. A friend told me about a sunscreen for the scalp, but I
am not able to locate it _ Head Smart by Coppertone. I have looked
on their Web site and did not find it either. Have you heard of a
sunscreen that I can spray onto my scalp after my hair has been
shampooed and fixed, and should it be sprayed before or after I
apply hairspray? _ Brent N.
</P>
<P>
   A: Head Smart was test marketed last year in select areas so it
is not available currently. However, the next generation of this
spray-on sun block is. Pick up Coppertone Sport Sun Block Spray in
SPF 15 or SPF 30. This is sweatproof and should be applied after
grooming. Remove it later from your scalp with soap and water. It
is fast-drying and, good news, widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I got an idea off the Web to give my reception guests tree
saplings as favors. Supposedly this person called a conservation
department and they sent her the saplings in tubes. Do you have any
idea whom to contact for this? _ L. Warren
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure do. The GreenWorld Project sells several items that fill
the bill. Trees from this organization are sent in a clear plastic
sleeve or tube with your personal message attached or inside.
Perfect for wedding guests or for other events. Some customers
order the trees to memorialize lost loved ones. You may select a
ribbon color and cap color for the tubed trees, which come in 8-,
10-, and 14-inch sizes. Maybe the wedding day petals, birdseed or
bird feeder tree would interest you. To help make a decision, order
the wedding day sample package (one of everything) before deciding.
The 8-inch tree in a tube begins at $2.25 each plus shipping.
Sorry, no break for quantity unless you have a really big wedding _
a thousand people. Contact GreenWorld at (800) 825-5122 or
www.greenworldproject.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I finally got around to watching the movie ``Saving Private
Ryan'' on video. It was an awesome movie, but it left me wondering
about the final scene, which shows an elderly ``Private Ryan''
looking over the grave of Captain Miller at the cemetery at
Normandy, France. I thought those service members buried at
Normandy had died during that battle, not at other battle sites (as
indicated by the movie). _ Mark M.
</P>
<P>
   A: American soldiers who died in the general area, not just
those who died in the invasion, were eligible for burial in this
cemetery, according to the American Battle Monuments Commission.
The fictitious Captain Miller died in the area so his interment at
the cemetery is plausible. This cemetery, by the way, was the first
American military cemetery established in Europe.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to locate an official Texas Rangers badge for
friends in California who would like to wear it on a trail ride
celebrating their sesquicentennial. _ Don Sulak A: Don, Don, Don _
think about it for a minute. The first official Texas Ranger badge
was issued in 1935 and there have been three designs since then. In
1935 there were only 42 Rangers (107 currently). Not that many
badges out there. So the official badges tend to stay with the
Rangers or their families. I would be suspicious of the
authenticity of any purported badge at an auction. The current
style (circle star) first appeared in a design used by a Ranger
Detachment under Ira Aten, whose squad quelled the 1889
Jaybird-Woodpecker War in Fort Bend County. The Texas Ranger Museum
archivist suggests you pick up a replica badge from the museum gift
store in Waco. Call (254) 750-8631.

   Q: We are having trouble with carpenter ants in our trees and
house. We cut back the trees and had a pest control company spray
the house. We need someone who can take care of the trees and the
house. _ Brenda T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Carpenter ants build nests in hollow trees and logs as well
as wood in homes. Unlike termites, the ants use the wood as a home,
not food. Entry points? Branches or utility lines touching a home,
window cracks, crevices, air conditioning ducts and attic
ventilation openings. The experts at the Texas Agricultural
Extension Service recommend that home owners identify colony
locations before treatment, replace decaying wood, repair plumbing
leaks, provide proper clearance between house and wood, remove
stumps and wood debris near the house and treat colonies within 100
feet of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was President Clinton's lottery number in the draft? Is
there a way to find out who had to go to Vietnam because he did
not? _ Henry M.
</P>
<P>
   A: No way to find out if someone went in an individual's place,
says Selective Service spokesman Lew Brodsky. President Clinton's
stint in the ROTC forestalled his induction in the armed services.
In the 1969 Selective Service Lottery, President' Clinton's
birthday, Aug. 19, was lucky _ No. 311. He and the other
registrants born between Jan. 1, 1944, and Dec. 31, 1950, were the
first to depart from the traditional method of induction call
(oldest men not yet 26). No. 1 in the 1969 lottery? Sept. 14.
Brodsky adds that when a draft is in operation, the most vulnerable
year for a young man to be drafted is the year he is 20 (out of
high school, usually not yet married and in good physical health).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you tell me the name of Hopalong Cassidy's horse? _
V.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Topper was the white steed of the black-and-white-clad
Hopalong (actor William Boyd). His sidekick? Red Conners played by
Edgar Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: For many years I have looked up at those monstrous water
towers and wondered about the millions of gallons of water just
sitting there and, well, looking not unlike my dog's water dish _
mossy and just plain yucky. Have you? _ David R. Compton
</P>
<P>
   A: Can't say that I have. Great mental picture, but incorrect.
The water in these towers meets drinking water standards. If you
climb up there, you can sip safely. Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission's Tom Kelley says the interiors of these
tower tanks are steel with an approved protective coating. The
water is checked regularly. Occasionally a tower tank water supply
will be the subject of complaints. Unprotected exterior painting of
the tower may toss paint chips and powder in the water. Yuck.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Gov. George W. Bush was re-elected to office and announced
his candidacy for president. Now that he is campaigning while in
office, what happens to his salary and what is the amount? _
Barbara Hatter
</P>
<P>
   A: The governor continues to earn his annual salary _
$115,344.96 _ while campaigning. When the governor is out of the
state for a complete calendar day (midnight to midnight), the
acting governor also receives a salary for that day, says spokesman
Scott McClellan. For example, if Bush is out of the state that full
calendar day, then Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, as acting governor,
receives $316.01 for that day, on top of his munificent annual
salary of $7,200.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some kids have told me that if you save 100 Tootsie Pop
wrappers with the Indian shooting an arrow with a star and send
them in you get a year of free Tootsie Pops. Please confirm or
deny. I am up to my ears in wrappers. _ Becky R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, Becky, there is no free Tootsie Pop. Toss the
wrappers. You are correct _ the wrapper with the star and Indian is
uncommon _ only about one in four are so marked. Chief Shooting
Star is the legendary inspiration for the chewy, Tootsie-centered
lollipops.
</P>
<P>
   First introduced in 1931, the Tootsie Pop, named for the
5-year-old daughter of maker Leo Hirshfield, has been the focus of
much research. Purdue University Engineering students modeled a
licking machine after a human tongue. With it the students
determined it takes an average of 364 licks to get to the chewy
center of a Tootsie Pop. (No crunching allowed.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give me the name of the theme song for the television
program ``Providence''? Also, can I buy it? _ Tom Hutchins
</P>
<P>
   A: How soon we forget. ``In My Life'' (a Beatles hit) is sung by
Chantal Kreviazuk. I have not found the song on her albums, but the
tremendous popularity of this show leads me to suspect the
``Providence'' soundtrack can't be long in coming. (Remember the
``Northern Exposure'' phenomenon?)
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should I do? I was informed of someone trying to use my
Social Security number to get credit. Do I need a new Social
Security number? Can I even get a new number?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: Trouble in River City. Glad you were notified. Some people
only find out after credit is extended to the thief. Contact the
three major credit reporting bureaus immediately and have your
credit history flagged. You will be contacted before credit is
extended in your name: Equifax at (800) 525-6285; Trans Union at
(800) 680-7289; and Experian at (800) 301-7195. If you are still
disadvantaged by the misuse of your number after these agencies
have been contacted, a new Social Security number may be assigned
to you. Then you must report the changed number everywhere you do
business. Of course there is no guarantee, says Social Security's
Sandra Talbot, that the new number will not fall into the wrong
hands. Please be careful.
</P>

   Q: I am a 30-year-old male with thinning hair. I am not the kind
of guy who looks good in a hat, so my scalp just keeps getting
sunburnt. A friend told me about a sunscreen for the scalp, but I
am not able to locate it _ Head Smart by Coppertone. I have looked

sunscreen that I can spray onto my scalp after my hair has been
shampooed and fixed, and should it be sprayed before or after I
apply hairspray? _ Brent N.
</P>
<P>
   A: Head Smart was test marketed last year in select areas so it
is not available currently. However, the next generation of this
spray-on sun block is. Pick up Coppertone Sport Sun Block Spray in
SPF 15 or SPF 30. This is sweatproof and should be applied after
grooming. Remove it later from your scalp with soap and water. It
is fast-drying and, good news, widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I got an idea off the Web to give my reception guests tree
saplings as favors. Supposedly this person called a conservation
department and they sent her the saplings in tubes. Do you have any
idea whom to contact for this? _ L. Warren
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure do. The GreenWorld Project sells several items that fill
the bill. Trees from this organization are sent in a clear plastic
sleeve or tube with your personal message attached or inside.
Perfect for wedding guests or for other events. Some customers
order the trees to memorialize lost loved ones. You may select a
ribbon color and cap color for the tubed trees, which come in 8-,
10-, and 14-inch sizes. Maybe the wedding day petals, birdseed or
bird feeder tree would interest you. To help make a decision, order
the wedding day sample package (one of everything) before deciding.
The 8-inch tree in a tube begins at $2.25 each plus shipping.

   BIDI-CIGARETTES (Albany, N.Y.) _ Sitting on a bicycle outside
Albany High School, the 16-year-old student unfolded his wallet and
plucked out one of the thin, flavored cigarettes that are gaining
popularity among Capital Region teenagers. The hand-rolled,
unfiltered butts _ called bidis, or beedies _ release two or three
times the nicotine and tar of regular cigarettes. Yet many people,
including this teenager, think they are cleaner than the average
smoke. By EDWARD FITZPATRICK
</P>
<P>
   BIDIS-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Q: Are bidis safer than regular
cigarettes?

   A: Despite containing less tobacco than a U.S. cigarette, an

nicotine.

   VATICAN-COLLEGES (Albany, N.Y.) _ Six months after U.S. bishops
called for closer ties between Catholic colleges and the Vatican,

papal document called ``Ex corde Ecclesiae,'' or ``From the Heart

Wednesday. By LOUIS B. PARKS

   FILM-VIDEOS-REVIEWS (Undated) _ A value of video is giving films

</P>
<P>
   RATTO-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Bud Selig usually has to hold the
cab door open for his fellow commissioners. Selig has been looking
up at David Stern and Paul Tagliabue for a long time, and for a lot
of reasons. After all, Tags had all the money and the TV ratings.
Stern had Larry Bird and Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan and all
the TV ratings Tagliabue couldn't use. Even Bettman had Wayne
Gretzky and Mario Lemieux and the Stanley Cup playoffs, and lots of
markets into which to expand. By RAY RATTO.

<P>
   BKN-WARRIORS (Oakland, Calif.) _ Garry St. Jean likes to tell
the story of the Eastern Conference general manager who insisted
that his colleagues deal with him only over the phone ``so he
wouldn't have to lie to your face.'' This is the time of year when
few GMs want to meet their peers in person. As Wednesday's NBA

   ROSENFELD-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Consumer spending seems a

retail, the selling of goods, in which spirit these observations

</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ Gov. George W. Bush, in
eulogizing Bob Bullock, praised the late Texas leader for reaching

Bullock, indeed, reached out. But Bush, as a rookie in statewide
politics in 1994, was savvy enough to reach out to Bullock first.

 &HT;    With proper search utensil, you can locate any recipe
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Almost every good cook owns a shelf or two of
cookbooks. It's easy to recognize the best cookbooks on the shelf.
Those are the ones with grease spots and flour on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best library of cookbooks fails us from time to time.
There will be a recipe you can't find, or it'll be time to find a
new way to prepare an old dish. That's when it's time to browse the
world's largest library of recipes _ the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of great sites filled with recipes and _ with
most _ you can use the computer's ability to search for information
and keywords to go directly to the recipe you need.
</P>
<P>
   Our appetizer on today's culinary adventure is a site called
SOAR. That stands for the Searchable Online Archive of Recipes.
You'll find the site at soar.berkeley.edu/recipes/. This place
lives up to its name. While you can search for recipes by category
_ main dish, dessert and so on _ the real strength here is in the
search engine.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like a lot of people, you may not remember the formal
name of the dish you want to prepare, but you do remember the
ingredients. For instance, let's say all you know is that the
recipe used the Italian wine Marsala.
</P>
<P>
   Using Marsala as a keyword, the search turned up more than 100
recipes (you'll have to do your own search to find out exactly how
many of the 57,000 recipes in this database use Marsala) before I
stopped counting. There was Linguine Gamberini, Chicken Florentine,
Pork with Figs, Salmon Scampi ... the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The search even has a feature that helps poor spellers: You can
set it so that even if you spell Marsala as ``marsalla'' it'll find
the term. You can also use multiple search words, which is
especially handy with a database this size. You probably wouldn't
want to search, for instance, simply for ``beef.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the ability to search is so important, let's take a look
at another recipe site with search features. This one is called the
Online Cookbook and is located at i99.com/cook/. You can search
this site by keyword, just like in our first example. However,
instead of the 100-plus recipes, a search for ``marsala'' here
turned up just six recipes. The difference seems to be that at this
site, you'll only get recipes with the keyword in the title. You
can also search an alphabetical index. So if you know the name of
the dish starts with a ``B,'' you can browse those recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site, the Culinary Cafe at www.culinarycafe.com/,
doesn't offer a keyword search. Instead, it uses a more
conventional approach. You select the category for the recipe _
cookies, cakes, main dishes, appetizers and so forth. For instance,
if you select the broad term of seafood, you'll go to a page where
you can then select recipes based on the type of seafood. It's a
more cumbersome process if you're searching for a specific recipe
but may be a handy method when you know that you want to prepare a
seafood dish but don't have a specific recipe in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The last stop on our search for the perfect recipe is at a place
called 1st Traveler's Choice Internet Cookbook at
www.virtualcities.com/ons/recipe.htm. The notion here is that the
recipes were gathered from famous restaurants, inns and hotels. The
search method here is the same as the one used at Culinary Cafe.
But there is a nifty feature that most cooks will appreciate. There
is a program on the page that helps you convert various measures.
So you'll be able to quickly find, for instance, that a half cup is
the same as 4 ounces, or 8 tablespoons, or 24 teaspoons, or 118 ml.
If you use a variety of cookbooks, including some from countries
that use liters and milliliters, then this will help you decipher
the measuring system.

 &HT;    Canvas combines graphics applications
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Canvas is the ClarisWorks of graphics programs. It
tries to integrate in one package all the elements of layout,
drawing and design.
</P>
<P>
   That's a tall order but, at least for beginners and intermediate
users, Canvas succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   But neither I nor most other reviewers would recommend this
program for pros and high-end graphics users. Professionals are
better off using Illustrator, Photoshop and Macromedia for the
specialized tasks these programs were created to do.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say Canvas is a bad program. On the contrary, it
has many strong features. Version 6.0, the latest, offers some big
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   No program, for starters, can combine vector and bitmapped
graphics as well as Canvas. It treats all types of graphic images
as objects, which you can mix easily.
</P>
<P>
   Another Canvas innovation is a technology called SpriteLayers.
This lets you layer various graphic objects, whether text, vector
or bitmapped, with full control over transparency.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive transparency feature is one called Channel
Mask. It lets you apply opacity variations using any of Canvas'
many paintbrushes. Just paint an area of a graphic to make it
transparent.
</P>
<P>
   With a graphics program, it's easy to get overwhelmed by
floating palettes. That was certainly true with earlier versions of
Canvas. But Version 6.0 has gone a long way toward cleaning up its
interface.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can customize Canvas' toolbar, adding just the buttons
and keyboard shortcuts of any feature used most often.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet is the docking bar, which appears just below the
toolbar at the top of the screen. You can drag any palette to the
docking bar, where it will appear for use. Just click on the
palette name, and it drops down for use.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements include a spelling checker and vastly
improved performance in terms of speed. Even large images can be
handled quickly now.
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion, MacWorld magazine recommended that all current
Canvas users upgrade to Canvas 6.0, the first new version in three
years. ``The new transparency features and bitmap performance
improvements alone are worth the price,'' said the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Canvas, published by Deneba in Miami, retails for $350. An
upgrade is about $100 less. To learn more about the program, check
out the company's Web site at www.deneba.com.

 &HT;    Hey, candidates: Show a little life
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The presidential pregame show is already under way,
even though there's more than a year to go before the actual
election. In addition to political advisers and pollsters, the
candidates of the next millennium are also hiring gurus to design
Web sites that will engage voters, garner donations and keep the
media up to date on their latest campaign doings.
</P>
<P>
   As the trade magazine The Industry Standard put it, ``Move over
James Carville and Mary Matalin. There's a new breed of political
consultant out there, one that knows how to write (Web design code)
HTML.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, nobody's doing a particularly good job of online
campaigning. Despite some of the high-paid firepower employed by
some of the leading candidates, it appears the heavy artillery is
on hold. What we have now are primarily introductory Web sites,
offering information, travel agendas, speeches, slogans and secure
servers so Web surfers can make donations before hopping off to
eBay to bid on that Rocky and Bullwinkle vintage lunchbox.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's one bit of advice every political candidate and
his or her Web team must learn. Write it on a blackboard 500 times
if you must, just learn it.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is a visual, interactive medium. Yes, that's right,
in-ter-ac-tive. Remember, you are talking to people who are used to
posting book reviews on Amazon.com, complaining to Lands' End that
their weekly overstocks site has too many orange polo shirts and
clogging Yahoo! Finance message boards with hot Internet stock
tips.
</P>
<P>
   This is your chance to let people talk to you. Complain to you.
For heaven's sake, this is a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week town
meeting. Go for it. Post your best pictures. Provide excerpts from
your best speeches. Tell us when you'll be in our town. Ask us what
we care about. Maybe have us take a poll or two. Do something,
anything to make voters get involved with you and your Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In-ter-ac-tive. If you don't know what it means, ask one of your
college student volunteers. Then do it.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the presidential sites are wading into the Web waters
with so-so results. For example, Al Gore, self-described Net geek,
has a Web site that lives up to his reputation as a somewhat
less-than-colorful candidate. But as anyone who has seen the vice
president poking fun at himself with David Letterman knows, the
candidate does have a lighter side. Only pieces of it show on his
Web site, and as Ross Perot would say, ``That's just sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gore is online every day, the people who put his Web
site together might want to head back to the design studio for a
few pointers. The site posts Gore's speeches as just one long page
of plain text. No pictures, nothing, simply an endless stream of
pale blue text. Few political speeches are memorable barnburners
the ordinary citizen will want to read again and again. However, if
the candidate has a serious message to convey, pouring it onto the
Internet is not the way to do it. It's boring and doesn't give
voters much insight.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Town Hall section is the most interesting part of the
site, and he'd do well to put this kind of interactive feature on
all his pages, especially the ones with the deadly speeches.
Ordinary people ask questions, and Gore gives simple answers in a
chatty but dignified tone.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate could also learn a thing or two from the page
devoted to his wife, Tipper. The page is filled with pictures of a
smiling Tipper traveling the world, hugging children and jogging
with the Russian Olympic team. Should Gore win the election, Tipper
won't have the political influence of Hillary Rodham Clinton, but
here she's shown at her political and personal best.
</P>
<P>
   Another tip for aspiring presidential candidates: Register those
Web addresses early and often. Register every variation on your
name or campaign you can think of. Pay for it yourself. They're
only $70 each from Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, you'll find yourself in the unfortunate situation of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose late entry into the online
campaign left plenty of room for a parody site, www.gwbush.com. The
site's not quite as funny as some of the parody sites that popped
up in 1996, but it is still official-looking enough to prompt the
governor, the apparent Republican front-runner, to file a legal
complaint against the site, which lampoons his personal life and
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be limits to freedom,'' Bush told The Dallas
Morning News. Not good. Definitely not good with those
free-speech-loving, anti-regulation Internet types. Taken out of
context, it could be upsetting to a whole lot of people who've
grown fond of the First Amendment over the last 210 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush now has his own official Web site, www.georgewbush
</P>
<P>
   .com, which looks as if it were designed by the folks who did
the parody site. Also not good. However, it was the first bit of
online political excitement to date and a potential political
setback for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates all have miles to go before the Web becomes an
essential campaign tool. There's plenty of time to learn to use it
to its best advantage. It really does matter.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you feel like nobody ever listens and nobody ever
thinks you're old enough to do anything, you need to read about
Wyatt. ``Quiet, Wyatt!'' by Bill Maynard (G.P. Putnam's Sons,
$15.99) is a new book about a little boy who's determined to teach
his whole town a lesson _ he matters, too! Great for younger
readers, the book is easy to follow and has colorful illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper shows off his swing
</P>
<P>
   Slammin' Sammy Sosa may be the cover boy for Sports Illustrated
for Kids, but we want to read about Chipper Jones. The Braves'
third baseman is in the July issue teaching us how to switch-hit.
There are great action shots and step-by-step instructions. He also
offers other batting tips. The issue is available for $2.95.

 &HT;    Georgia's (Revolutionary War) superheroes
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Casimir Pulaski wasn't from Georgia, but he was one of
our greatest heroes of the American Revolution. That's why a county
in Georgia and dozens of others across the country are named in his
honor.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting the British in Charleston during the Revolution,
Pulaski _ appointed a general by his friend George Washington _
took his cavalry to Savannah to win back land held by the British.
</P>
<P>
   In October of 1779, Pulaski's troops were ordered to support the
Colonial infantry in breaking the redcoats' line of defense in what
is now downtown Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in a crossfire, the American patriots and their French
allies were routed, but Pulaski led a charge to try to win the day.
</P>
<P>
   He was wounded in the fighting and was taken to a nearby
plantation, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pulaski was a Polish general who had led several failed
revolts in his own country, he's best remembered _ even in Poland _
as an American hero. There were lots of others from Georgia as
well.
</P>
<P>
   During the Revolution, Georgia was one of 13 American Colonies
that belonged to Great Britain. Most of the state was woodlands,
populated by small farmers.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Georgians weren't as angry with the British as people
in other Colonies. But after the Battle of Lexington in
Massachusetts on April 19, 1775, that began to change.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, the British had lots of soldiers in Georgia, mainly
to protect Colonists from Indians.
</P>
<P>
   So, when war came, many Georgians rooted for, and fought with,
the British. They were called Tories, and there was a lot of
fighting between Tories and patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Button Gwinnett, George Walton and Lyman Hall were Georgians who
could have been hanged as traitors for signing the Declaration of
Independence on July 4, 1776.
</P>
<P>
   All three have counties named for them in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   So does Archibald Bulloch, who at one time was president of
Georgia. He was a planter, clergyman and politician in the Colonial
version of the Georgia Legislature. He later was a delegate to the
Continental Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He was an outspoken leader for patriots _ at a time when
speaking against the British could cost you your life.
</P>
<P>
   Another county is named for Nancy Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Her deeds are so amazing that many think she's only a legend.
</P>
<P>
   She's known for killing a Tory and capturing four others all by
herself. Once, she dressed like a man to spy on the British in
Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   And although most black people in Georgia were slaves, some
fought for America's independence. One of the most famous is Austin
Dabney, who was given his freedom for his heroism in a battle near
Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's state government paid him a pension for wounds
suffered in battle until he died in 1830.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary War ended on Oct. 19, 1781. It took another
eight months to kick the British out of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the patriots lost the Battle of Savannah _ but found
a hero in Pulaski.
</P>
<P>
   DID YOU KNOW?
</P>
<P>
   There were many stories about what happened to Gen. Casimir
Pulaski's body after he died. Recently, some bones were found in a
55-foot monument that was falling apart in Savannah. Scientists
believe the bones are Pulaski's. They are testing DNA from the
bones to see if they match a Pulaski relative. The results are
expected soon.

 &HT;    Dive sticks can hurt kids
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Check your garages for pool dive sticks and don't play
with them anymore. The U.S. government says the sticks can hurt you
badly. These hard plastic sticks stand up in the bottom of pools
for kids to retrieve. However, a few kids cannonballing into the
water have been hospitalized after landing on the sticks and
getting stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second largest recall ever by the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission, which tries to protect people from
dangerous products. More than 19 million of the sticks have sold
since 1979. The Commission also wants to ban the sticks so they
can't be sold again.
</P>
<P>
   You should return them to the stores from which they were bought
for refunds or substitute toys.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees flood homeland
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers in Yugoslavia are struggling to protect Serbs from
revenge attacks by returning Kosovar Albanians. More than 300,000
of the Muslim refugees flooded back into Kosovo last week. The
returning refugees torched Serb houses and looted Serb-owned shops.
Panicky Serbs left nearby towns, accusing ethnic Albanians of
chasing them out.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Serbs were attacking the Kosovar Albanians,
killing many and forcing others from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   About 860,000 Kosovar Albanians were reported to have fled or
been expelled from Kosovo since NATO launched a bombing campaign
March 24. The bombing was meant to force Yugoslavia to accept a
peace plan for the province.
</P>
<P>
   Man not tasty to sharks
</P>
<P>
   You'll be relieved to know that most great white sharks don't
want to eat you. In fact, they don't even think you taste very
good. A research team observed 128 white shark attacks on seals,
sea lions and birds. They noted the sharks attacked seals with such
gusto that some were bitten in two. Yet with other items _ a
pelican, a decomposing seal, a sheep's carcass, a buoy and a
surfboard _ the sharks would cautiously mouth them and spit them
out. The scientists say the same is true with humans.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation is that white sharks are warm-blooded,
and may need a high-energy diet. To a shark, a blubbery seal is
like a Snickers bar, but humans aren't fatty enough.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have been a few exceptions. Worldwide, there
have been 245 documented great white shark attacks on people and 64
deaths since 1876, according to the Florida Museum of Natural
History.

 &HT;    Family photo album has gone high-tech
 &HT;    By Omar Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I have a cousin named Brianna whom, because of
work commitments, I wasn't able to see in person for a long time
after she was born.
</P>
<P>
   When she was about 2 years old, I opened my e-mail to discover a
huge, full-color photo of the baby sent by my parents. Immediately,
I got a breathless call from my mother. She wanted to make sure I
received the scanned photo, and of course, to comment on how cute
Brianna was. ``Que hermosa!'' my mom said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing my mother get excited about an infant isn't new, but
seeing her thrilled about a new piece of technology (in this case,
a scanner I'd lent her) is.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of other home users are getting excited, too, because PC
components like scanners, digital cameras, color printers and
editing software have dropped so far in price that even casual PC
users can turn their computers into photo editing studios.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just about price, although sub-$100 scanners and
ever-cheaper color printers have helped. The real reason why people
are turning to digital photos is that many users who only use their
computers for word processing or checkbook balancing have found a
killer application that is practical and truly useful.
</P>
<P>
   Digital photos are the culmination of several wants that
consumers have had and technological and pricing steps that are
fulfilling them. They are:
</P>
<P>
   _Storage _ Print photos decay, get lost, get torn up by angry
ex-spouses, get misfiled in family albums. The increasing size of
hard drives and the increasing number of storage options on PCs
(Zip drives, recordable CDs) make storing large numbers of large
photo files possible. Software makers like E-Book Systems have
created software like ``Digital Flip Album,'' which lets users
create slide shows and computerized photo albums.
</P>
<P>
   _Web development _ As more companies and individuals put up Web
pages, digital cameras and scanners have made it easy to turn
text-only Web pages into colorful, image-laden sites.
</P>
<P>
   _Easy mailing _ E-mail has made the near-instantaneous exchange
of data a reality. Being able to send photos to grandma with a few
clicks of a mouse button (provided she has an Internet account) is
a real-world, practical use for all the technology that the Intels
and Microsofts have been pushing all these years.
</P>
<P>
   _Easy transport _ Digital photos are pretty portable as it is,
with several dozen fitting on a single Zip disk, but future plans
are to make them even more so. Sony, for instance, has introduced
the Memory Stick, a plastic piece of memory that measures about the
size of a stick of gum. A memory stick will hold music, photos and
files and can transfer information between computers, digital
devices and even digital picture frames that can display an image
on a flat screen.
</P>
<P>
   _Photo editing _ Last week, Britain's new Earl of Wessex, Prince
Edward, had a royal photographer replace a glum-looking Prince
William from a photo of Edward's wedding with a happier image of
the young man using digital editing. While this may be a little
extreme, digital editing software can perform more simple tasks
like removing red-eye from photos, cropping a photo, erasing
smudges and spots on an image and even changing the background on a
picture. While it also makes it easier to doctor photos to suggest
alien abductions, photo editing can help correct problems in what
would otherwise be perfect pictures.
</P>
<P>
   _Quality and production _ The newer digital image products,
including mega-pixel digital cameras and high-resolution scanners,
produce much better-quality images than older models, which
sometimes produced grainy, pixelized pictures. A chief complaint
among early adopters was poor imaging, but as the technology has
improved, digital photos can now rival the sharpness and depth of
print photos. If that can be achieved without a stop at the
one-hour photo shop, consumers will find it more convenient.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that the digital revolution spells the end
of print photos, but print image giants like Kodak and Adobe have
been quick to produce software and Web sites that cater to home
users who want new ways to store and use photos.
</P>
<P>
   Archiving digital memories will continue to get cheaper and
easier, saving us more time and money to take photogenic vacations
that will end up in our PC scrapbooks.

 &HT;    Oohs and aahs tell the story of this minivan
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If I told you that minivans are the vehicles that
drive me to renew my driver's license, I'd be lying. They are the
dry toast of the automotive industry _ necessary, useful, but not
adrenaline-pumping.
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine my curiosity when I saw this look of pure
ecstasy come over a woman at the post office as she approached the
Honda Odyssey I was test driving. I understood her reaction when
she climbed into her own 10-plus-year-old minivan.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, it was a similar experience in the parking lot of
a local discount store, but this time, the driver was lusting from
a new minivan. Then, at a racetrack, the driver of a late-model
stock car who had just turned in a blistering qualifying lap was
more interested in talking about the Odyssey than his qualifying
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear it's got lots of room,'' he said. ``My neighbor
actually uses his to transport his son's competition go-kart and
all its spares on the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   I liked the Odyssey's 3.5-liter V-6 low-emissions VTEC engine,
the most powerful in the minivan segment. But I also liked the way
the Odyssey drove. Many minivans, when loaded down, tend to waddle
down the highway. To its credit, the Odyssey's handling
characteristics remained consistent whether fully loaded or with
just me driving. This could be because of the Odyssey's rear
double-wishbone suspension and gas-pressurized shocks.
</P>
<P>
   Odyssey's low entry threshold accommodates easy entry and exit.
Loaded, at highway speeds, the Odyssey gave better than 23 miles
per gallon. I also liked all the usable space.
</P>
<P>
   You really don't realize just how big a vehicle it is until you
go to wash it.
</P>
<P>
   The fold-down third seat is without question the best in the
industry. The Odyssey can have a perfectly flat floor from the rear
door all the way to the back of the front seats.
</P>
<P>
   I was fond of the little table between the two front bucket
seats. My initial reaction was that it would be flimsy and
impractical, but nothing could have been further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The minivan set knows its stuff. From women lusting in the
parking lots to racers looking for a new set of wheels, a 159.2
percent increase in Odyssey sales in May confirms the vehicle's
popularity.

 &HT;    Security systems offer comfort
 &HT;    By Karen Dean
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Say the words ``home security'' and what comes to
mind?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you envision a few simple deadbolt locks. Perhaps you
picture elaborate laser beams and infrared sensors that would put
the CIA to shame. Then again, your idea of home security may be
faithful Bitsy, the ankle-chewing Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you picture it, Americans are becoming more
security-conscious, and the home security industry is thriving.
According to the National Burglar and Fire Alarm Association,
Americans spent an estimated $14.8 billion on professionally
installed electronic security products and services in 1997 alone.
By the end of 1998, more than 20 percent of households were
estimated to be electronically protected.
</P>
<P>
   The reason seems to be that electronic protection works. Studies
have shown that homes without the benefit of security systems are
two to three times more likely to be burglarized than those
equipped with them. Since burglary is one of the least likely
crimes to be solved, with a rate of only 13.4 percent solved
nationwide, an alarm system may be a comforting solution.
</P>
<P>
   So you think you might want to join the wired brigade? Well, the
good news is that you won't have to cash in that 401(k) to pay for
the system. With prices ranging from $150 for a no-frills system to
upward of six figures for an intricate network of video,
multiple-entry monitoring and infrared sensors, there's a system
for just about every budget.
</P>
<P>
   Before you hop in the car to scope out what's available, take a
look around your house. The easiest and cheapest home protection
comes in the form of sturdy locks and window pins. Even with an
alarm, a thief has a few moments before police arrive, so securing
those entry points can go a long way toward keeping your property
in the house, where it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of any effective security system is to deter, delay
and detect,'' says Officer Ginger Smith of the Gwinnett County,
Ga., Crime Prevention Unit. ``Visible decals and a good combination
of locks, sensors and audible alarms can make your home less
appealing to a burglar.''
</P>
<P>
   Security systems come in two basic forms: hard-wired versions
and battery-operated wireless systems. The hard-wired system links
the indoor sensors to a central control panel by wiring run through
the house. Wireless systems operate by tiny transistors contained
in the door and window sensors that send radio frequencies to a
main control box. During an attempted break-in, either system sends
a message from the sensors to the main control board, activating
the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   While many industry experts continue to feel that hard-wired
systems are more reliable, the wireless alternatives are gaining
popularity and may be more practical in homes without ready access
to interior wiring, such as in an unfinished basement.
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding on any system, experts suggest you consider your
lifestyle and needs. Living with an alarm system requires
adjustments, like remembering to arm and disarm the alarm when
leaving or returning home. Children or indoor pets can make certain
alarms or motion sensors a nightmare to deal with, so you may need
a program with customizing options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many one-size-fits-all systems give a false sense of security
for the homeowner,'' says Jim Callahan of Ackerman Security. ``The
best choice is to have a trained consultant view your home with
you. The choice of options is still yours, but a professional
designer can make recommendations to best utilize the system for
your home.''
</P>
<P>
   Most alarm systems provide perimeter sensors that guard doors
and windows. You can then purchase additional sensors that offer
protection in case an intruder gets inside the house. Motion
detectors are often used to detect motion or heat changes in a
room, which trigger the alarm. Passive infrared motion sensors work
by detecting increases in temperature. But dual-technology sensors
are available that detect motion and heat simultaneously and may
reduce your risk of false alarms.
</P>
<P>
   When you finally decide on a system, you're not limited to
professional installation. The ``let me do it'' syndrome has
reached the security industry as well, and several local companies
offer products and advice for those willing to tackle the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``A knowledgeable do-it-yourselfer can often do as good a job as
many professional installers,'' says Craig Degrenier of
DeKalb-Gwinnett Alarm Co.
</P>
<P>
   A basic self-installed hard-wired system with control panel,
motion detector and three door-and-window sensors can be bought for
as little as $189, with extra window and door sensors for around $5
each and additional motion detectors starting at $30 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless components require a lot less effort to install and
about as much electronics knowledge as setting up a stereo. Place
your door and window sensors, set up for monitoring, and you're
ready to go. Plus, when you're ready to move, the system can be
packed up along with the dishes and taken to your new home.
Retailers such as Radio Shack, Home Depot and Lowe's sell the
wireless components, with prices starting at $150 for a console,
sensors for four doors or windows and a motion detector.
</P>
<P>
   A word of caution for budding do-it-yourselfers, though. Placing
the sensors correctly can make the difference between a
well-functioning alarm and one that consistently cries wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that magnetic contacts and motion detectors be
set and aimed accurately,'' says Bill Zelud, editor of Security
Distributing Magazine, an industry guide. ``Failing to place those
correctly can compromise the effectiveness of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you have made your choice _ hard-wired or wireless _ you're
left with the decision of whether to have the system monitored.
Monitoring is an optional cost, but many industry insiders feel
it's critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monitoring is the backbone and what makes the whole system
work,'' says Bruce Goldberg of Brinks. ``That's what guarantees a
quick response to your alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring company receives and verifies an alarm, then
notifies the appropriate law enforcement agency. With an
unmonitored audible alarm, you're relying on your neighbors to
finally get tired of hearing that noise and call the police. By
that time, your favorite VCR could be occupying the top shelf in
Bub's Pawn Palace.
</P>
<P>
   While many monitoring companies welcome self-installed
hard-wired systems, not all are so receptive. Many larger
companies, such as Ackerman, Brinks and ADT, will not monitor
systems that were not professionally installed because of concerns
regarding installation procedures or the risk of increased false
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring is also available for wireless components, with many
retailers offering services when you purchase your system. The
monitoring fees typically are $20 a month and up, often available
without a long-term commitment. But whether hard-wired or wireless,
shopping around in the competitive Atlanta market often results in
a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   Beside providing peace of mind, there may also be a bonus to
your wallet for having a home-security system. Many insurers offer
discounts up to 20 percent to policyholders with security systems.
However, monitoring or professional installation may be required
for the discount to apply, so check with your agent before spending
those savings.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever choice you make, the knowledge of an extra watchful
eye guarding your home and family can give you some added
assurances of safety. And give Bitsy a well-deserved rest.

 &HT;    Private technology leaders recognized
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a list for everything these days, and private
technology companies are no exception. The June issue of Upside
magazine lists what it considers the 100 top private technology
companies. The winners were picked, the magazine says, from some
1,000 contenders. Among those selected was Brocade Communications
Systems of San Jose, Calif. It makes fiber-channel switching
equipment used in digital networks. Another winner was Copper
Mountain Networks of Palo Alto, Calif. Copper Mountain makes a
technology that speeds up the digital telephone technology the Baby
Bells are trying to deploy.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   You can learn just about everything via computer these days, and
that includes music. Harmonic Vision, based in Evanston, Ill., has
released two computer CDs that teach kids the fundamentals of music
theory and how to read music. The CDs are called Music Ace and
Music Ace 2. The first program is for beginners, the second for
more advanced students. Each program retails for about $50. For
more information about the Music Ace CDs, check out the company's
Web site at www.harmonicvision.com. You can also download free
demos of the programs, which will work on both Macs and PCs, from
the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Edmark, a educational software company based in Seattle, has
released two new titles in its Thinkin' Things series. ``All Around
Frippletown'' uses the motif of a silly town to teach
problem-solving and logic. Edmark's second title uses a mystery
motif to teach the same skills in ``Sky Island Mysteries.'' Kids
help Inspector Cluestoe solve 14 mysteries. In doing so, they are
called on to gather information and draw conclusions. Each game is
available for either PCs or Macs and retails for about $30.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   There are tons of new developments in the Apple and Mac
community. A great way to keep up with all the changes is a Web
site called MacSurfer. It's a compendium of headlines and items
from the major Mac sites across the Web. Click on a headline, and
you'll jump right to the story. MacSurfer also maintains links to
sites that list software upgrades. You'll find MacSurfer at www
</P>
<P>
   .macsurfer.com.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the fastest way to look up information, but it does
work. Encyclopedia.com is a Web-based encyclopedia. You type in a
request in the search window, and the site presents a definition
and other information. You'll find this site at www
</P>
<P>
   .encyclopedia.com/.

 &HT;    If all else fails, think of the Web as tech support
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's the world's good fortune that I am not an airline
pilot or a brain surgeon. I learn best after making a horrible
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Microsoft sent me its Windows 98 Update, and I
installed it on my home computer. Everything seemed to go OK
through the installation process, but when the installation was
over, everything on my screen looked as if it had been drawn in
crayon. The colors were way off.
</P>
<P>
   So I clicked on the desktop screen with the right mouse button,
selected Properties and then selected the Settings tab to check the
video setup, since something was obviously wrong with the way
Windows set up my video card. Sure enough, Windows hadn't found the
driver (drivers are the small programs used by your PC to control
various devices such as modems, video cards, sound cards, scanners
and the like). So it installed a generic driver that comes with
Windows and _ as a result _ my computer could only work in its
lowest setting for graphics: 16-color mode. That's like trading in
your Ferrari for a used Yugo.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, I figured. I'll get the floppy disk that includes
the installation program for my Matrox video card. Then it's a
simple matter of opening up the Add/Remove Hardware icon in the
Control Panel folder, putting the disk in my A: drive and telling
the PC to use the video driver on the floppy.
</P>
<P>
   I moved back in September, and things are still in disarray. I
pawed through about 10 boxes of floppy disks _ found some that
contained copy for ads that I wrote back in the 1980s when I worked
for advertising agencies, found disks with old short stories I
tried to write, found everything but the disk for my video card.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the computer still worked fine in 16-color mode. I
could see the screen, and the modem still worked. So I popped over
to the Web site for Matrox, downloaded the drivers for my video
card and was back in business.
</P>
<P>
   That's lesson No. 1 today. The Web is an 24-hour tech support
center. If you need a driver or an update to a program you own,
check the Web first. Most often, you'll find the address for the
Web site in the printed material that came with the product. But
even if it isn't listed there, you can almost certainly find the
address by using one of the search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's move to lesson No. 2. If I had remembered this
lesson, I would have never needed lesson No. 1. Keep all your most
important disks _ the ones you'd need if you ever had to reinstall
Windows or if something goes wrong with your hard disk _ in one
spot. When you computer goes down, there's a natural sense of panic
anyway, and that's the worst time to start scattering the contents
of desk drawers around on a mad search. There will be times when
your computer won't work at all without the necessary disk, which
means you can't always depend on getting what you need from a Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson No. 3 caught me by surprise. When I finally found the
Matrox Web site I realized that, while I knew the name of the
manufacturer, I did not remember the specific model of video card
that I owned. Ordinarily, you could just pop over to the System
icon in the Control Panel folder and read the name under the
hardware section. But since Windows didn't recognize the card, that
option wasn't open to me.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't find the printed invoice that came with my computer,
nor could I find the manual for the video card. So that left me
with the option of opening up the computer to look on the video
card itself or tear into still another box of computer stuff.
Luckily, in this case Matrox has some generic drivers for idiots
such as myself _ these drivers work with all models of Matrox
cards.
</P>
<P>
   So my computer is up and running again. The new version of
Windows 98 is well-behaved. Things are in living color once again.
And I'm a little bit smarter.

 &HT;    Read up before lighting the grill
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first time you tried to fake your way through
being an outdoor cook, you may have ended up with oxymoron meat:
charred but raw.
</P>
<P>
   Had there been a site like Better Homes and Gardens Online's
Summer Cooking School around, you might not have had to settle for
take-out that night.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.bhg.com/food/grillschool/, takes you through the
basics _ how to pile the charcoal, how much lighter fluid to use
and how to light the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Reading it will save you the trouble, and expense, of squirting
lighter fluid on a hill of coals as if you were trying to douse a
flame rather than start one. Once lit, the coals are supposed to be
left to heat up for at least 20 minutes. Mine sat for about 10
minutes, which is why the chicken cooked a bit unevenly.
</P>
<P>
   Grill-master mistakes are not limited to the charcoal grill, and
neither is the Web site's instruction.
</P>
<P>
   A separate section explains how to light a gas grill (one hint:
leave the lid up) and how to cook on and clean a gas grill.
</P>
<P>
   The site is divided into six sections: gas grilling basics,
charcoal grilling basics, key techniques, flavor enhancers, handy
utensils and grilling books.
</P>
<P>
   Study to determine what cell phone does to brain
</P>
<P>
   Ever wondered what holding a cell phone to your ear does to your
brain, but don't have time to hold it there for a few years to find
out?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at England's Bristol University have the time. A
mobile phone will be placed next to the ear of a model of a human
head for two years to study what high-frequency radio signals do to
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The July issue of Popular Mechanics magazine has that little
nugget. The magazine can also be reached online, at
www.popularmechanics.com.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the issue is a look at cell phones with Internet access
and a piece on how to goose your iMac so it is Windows-compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Ballparks.com offers a bit of sports-related nostalgia
</P>
<P>
   If you're a sports fan, stadiums and arenas are near-holy
places. If you're a sports fan older than 20, many of those
near-holy places are gone.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site called Ballparks.com is keeping the faith. The site,
www.ballparks
</P>
<P>
   .com, has photographs, trivia and details about old arenas and
ballparks from the major pro leagues of baseball, basketball,
hockey and football.
</P>
<P>
   For most ballparks, outdoor and indoor pictures are included.
The pages usually include interesting bits of trivia about each
stadium or arena. For example, who knew that Detroit's Tiger
Stadium has the only in-play flagpole in the major leagues?
</P>
<P>
   Even more worthwhile, the site has pictures _ sometimes
architectural drawings, sometimes construction images _ of new
stadiums and arenas, including Atlanta's Philips Arena and
Detroit's Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are links to official arena Web sites and official
ballpark Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bubbly artwork for the stars _ and you
</P>
<P>
   Now you, too, thanks to the Internet, can own what Lily Tomlin,
RuPaul, Rosanna Arquette and Frank Zappa's family own.
</P>
<P>
   The artwork of Allee Willis, a Grammy Award-winning Southern
California songwriter and artist, is selling really campy art under
the name Bubbles. You can see and buy her work at
bubblestheartist.com.
</P>
<P>
   Her paintings, which can be bought from the Web site, range in
price from $65 to $250.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers a catalog of Bubbles' work, searchable by items
in the painting. You can search by hairstyles or for ``paintings
with eyeglasses,'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   As a songwriter, Willis wrote the theme song for the TV show,
``Friends,'' as well as ``September,'' which was performed by
Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire.
</P>
<P>
   The art of Bubbles the Artist is collected by Tomlin, Paul,
Arquette and several Zappas.

 &HT;    DeLorme's Topo USA knows its terrain well
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ DeLorme, the most prolific and diverse publisher of
digital maps, has produced a topographical map of the United
States, available in one whopping big DVD disk or by regions on
single CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   While I am no cartographic expert, Topo USA seems a remarkable
achievement; the entire United States _ all 50 states _ in
topographical detail on a single disk, with a full complement of
bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing thing about the maps is the available detail.
You can zoom in to a scale of 100 feet to 1 inch, with contour
changes shown at intervals of 20 feet everywhere but in Alaska,
where the maximum is 100 feet. I was able to determine the
elevation of my own house.
</P>
<P>
   You can search for a geographic point, a town or a street
address, and all are produced remarkably quickly.
</P>
<P>
   There is a set of tools for drawing on a map, and a mode in
which you can set up a hiking trip, complete with waypoints. All
this can be saved as a separate map and printed out in case you
aren't lugging your laptop with you.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you are lugging the laptop, the map will
work with DeLorme's Global Positioning satellite receivers to show
you exactly where you are at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   The normal view is top down with standard indicators of
elevation change. As you move the cursor across the screen, a
window on the left side contains boxes that constantly change to
show the latitude and longitude, and the elevation, of the cursor
location. Upon your order, the view will shift to a 3-D elevation
that can be controlled in terms of angle and rotation. It is not a
great rendering, but it gives a good idea of the terrain.
</P>
<P>
   You can change the regular cursor to a ``query cursor,'' so that
clicking anywhere on the map provides information on the specific
location. This is most useful, as the maps are not cluttered with a
lot of place names. Ponds of 4-5 acres loom like the Great Lakes at
maximum zoom levels. Many creeks that doubtless have names are
relegated to the status of ``intermittent stream,'' but you can't
expect everything, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Topo USA is full of pleasant surprises. I asked it to
find Ingalls in Oklahoma, expecting no response. But the program
cogitated for a couple of seconds and then presented me with a map
of north central Oklahoma and a label pointing to Ingalls.
</P>
<P>
   This was a surprise because Ingalls no longer exists. More than
100 years ago it was an outlaw town, and became the scene of one of
the most epic gunbattles in Western history when a couple of
wagonloads of U.S. deputy marshals tried to capture the Doolin
gang. Now, however, none of the buildings remains and it is largely
blackjack thicket, a piece of history gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   Not in Topo, however, and to my delight, when I asked the
``query cursor'' to report on the location, it came back describing
Ingalls not as a town, but as a locale.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a hiker, but I love maps and Topo USA is a treat. The
DVD is priced at a very reasonable list of $100.

 &HT;    'Flat-rate' repairs usually aid customers
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last winter, the power window in my mother's '81 Olds
decided to quit in the down position. With our mild climate in
Atlanta, this situation would have been nothing more than an
inconvenience. But in Reno, Nev., freezing temperatures, blowing
snow and my 98-year-old granny turning blue in the front seat
constituted an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   My mother managed to get the car to her mechanic's shop just as
he was closing down for the weekend. Realizing her predicament, he
reopened the shop door and motioned her inside. Within half an hour
he had restored the window to the up position, a temporary fix that
would require the replacement of the window motor when the part
came in. Until then, the car could be driven, and the heater would
keep its passengers warm.
</P>
<P>
   Mom relayed the story to me the following week, complaining,
``He charged me for an hour's time to do that job and it didn't
take him 20 minutes!''
</P>
<P>
   I was appalled at her attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're lucky you got it fixed at all,'' I retorted. ``Most
shops would have kept the car and sent you and Nonnie home in a cab
without weekend transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   My irritation spent, I calmly went on to explain the flat-rate
system. In short, most mechanics get paid by the job, not the
amount of time it takes them to do that job.
</P>
<P>
   Her mechanic probably had done that kind of repair many times.
She was charged for his knowledge of the problem and his expertise
in fixing it. An inexperienced mechanic might have taken two hours.
The charge still would have been for one hour. While not all
automotive repairs, particularly diagnostics, neatly fit into the
``flat-rate'' category, those that do usually work to the
customer's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the system encourages volume production. With
many businesses that operate this way, quality can suffer.
</P>
<P>
   I could have sympathized with Mom's tale had the window fallen
down or broken on the way home, but it held throughout the week, as
promised. She was, of course, charged again when the window motor
was replaced, and the mechanic beat the flat rate on that job, too.
The window still works fine.
</P>
<P>
   I hear the ``flat-rate blues'' all the time from both customers
and mechanics. Customers feel like they're being overcharged for
labor. Mechanics say that the flat-rate time being paid for many
complicated repairs is not enough to do the job properly.
Consequently, they may make money on the easy repairs and lose
money on the hard ones.
</P>
<P>
   The system certainly encourages shortcuts. Some are harmless,
but some produce shoddy results.
</P>
<P>
   While I am not a fan of the flat-rate system, it seems to work
for non-automotive businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A recent bout with pneumonia sent me to my HMO provider's
medical office. After an examination and a chest X-ray, I was sent
home with a bag full of medicine. A week passed and my symptoms
worsened, so I went back to the office. Another office visit,
another co-payment.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, salaries are a method of flat-rate pay.
If the job is completed in 30, 40 or 80 hours, the pay is the same.

 &HT;    With proper search utensil, you can locate any recipe
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Almost every good cook owns a shelf or two of
cookbooks. It's easy to recognize the best cookbooks on the shelf.
Those are the ones with grease spots and flour on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best library of cookbooks fails us from time to time.
There will be a recipe you can't find, or it'll be time to find a
new way to prepare an old dish. That's when it's time to browse the
world's largest library of recipes _ the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of great sites filled with recipes and _ with
most _ you can use the computer's ability to search for information
and keywords to go directly to the recipe you need.
</P>
<P>
   Our appetizer on today's culinary adventure is a site called
SOAR. That stands for the Searchable Online Archive of Recipes.
You'll find the site at soar.berkeley.edu/recipes/. This place
lives up to its name. While you can search for recipes by category
_ main dish, dessert and so on _ the real strength here is in the
search engine.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like a lot of people, you may not remember the formal
name of the dish you want to prepare, but you do remember the
ingredients. For instance, let's say all you know is that the
recipe used the Italian wine Marsala.
</P>
<P>
   Using Marsala as a keyword, the search turned up more than 100
recipes (you'll have to do your own search to find out exactly how
many of the 57,000 recipes in this database use Marsala) before I
stopped counting. There was Linguine Gamberini, Chicken Florentine,
Pork with Figs, Salmon Scampi ... the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The search even has a feature that helps poor spellers: You can
set it so that even if you spell Marsala as ``marsalla'' it'll find
the term. You can also use multiple search words, which is
especially handy with a database this size. You probably wouldn't
want to search, for instance, simply for ``beef.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the ability to search is so important, let's take a look
at another recipe site with search features. This one is called the
Online Cookbook and is located at i99.com/cook/. You can search
this site by keyword, just like in our first example. However,
instead of the 100-plus recipes, a search for ``marsala'' here
turned up just six recipes. The difference seems to be that at this
site, you'll only get recipes with the keyword in the title. You
can also search an alphabetical index. So if you know the name of
the dish starts with a ``B,'' you can browse those recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site, the Culinary Cafe at www.culinarycafe.com/,
doesn't offer a keyword search. Instead, it uses a more
conventional approach. You select the category for the recipe _
cookies, cakes, main dishes, appetizers and so forth. For instance,
if you select the broad term of seafood, you'll go to a page where
you can then select recipes based on the type of seafood. It's a
more cumbersome process if you're searching for a specific recipe
but may be a handy method when you know that you want to prepare a
seafood dish but don't have a specific recipe in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The last stop on our search for the perfect recipe is at a place
called 1st Traveler's Choice Internet Cookbook at
www.virtualcities.com/ons/recipe.htm. The notion here is that the
recipes were gathered from famous restaurants, inns and hotels. The
search method here is the same as the one used at Culinary Cafe.
But there is a nifty feature that most cooks will appreciate. There
is a program on the page that helps you convert various measures.
So you'll be able to quickly find, for instance, that a half cup is
the same as 4 ounces, or 8 tablespoons, or 24 teaspoons, or 118 ml.
If you use a variety of cookbooks, including some from countries
that use liters and milliliters, then this will help you decipher
the measuring system.

 &HT;    Canvas combines graphics applications
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Canvas is the ClarisWorks of graphics programs. It
tries to integrate in one package all the elements of layout,
drawing and design.
</P>
<P>
   That's a tall order but, at least for beginners and intermediate
users, Canvas succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   But neither I nor most other reviewers would recommend this
program for pros and high-end graphics users. Professionals are
better off using Illustrator, Photoshop and Macromedia for the
specialized tasks these programs were created to do.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say Canvas is a bad program. On the contrary, it
has many strong features. Version 6.0, the latest, offers some big
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   No program, for starters, can combine vector and bitmapped
graphics as well as Canvas. It treats all types of graphic images
as objects, which you can mix easily.
</P>
<P>
   Another Canvas innovation is a technology called SpriteLayers.
This lets you layer various graphic objects, whether text, vector
or bitmapped, with full control over transparency.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive transparency feature is one called Channel
Mask. It lets you apply opacity variations using any of Canvas'
many paintbrushes. Just paint an area of a graphic to make it
transparent.
</P>
<P>
   With a graphics program, it's easy to get overwhelmed by
floating palettes. That was certainly true with earlier versions of
Canvas. But Version 6.0 has gone a long way toward cleaning up its
interface.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can customize Canvas' toolbar, adding just the buttons
and keyboard shortcuts of any feature used most often.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet is the docking bar, which appears just below the
toolbar at the top of the screen. You can drag any palette to the
docking bar, where it will appear for use. Just click on the
palette name, and it drops down for use.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements include a spelling checker and vastly
improved performance in terms of speed. Even large images can be
handled quickly now.
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion, MacWorld magazine recommended that all current
Canvas users upgrade to Canvas 6.0, the first new version in three
years. ``The new transparency features and bitmap performance
improvements alone are worth the price,'' said the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Canvas, published by Deneba in Miami, retails for $350. An
upgrade is about $100 less. To learn more about the program, check
out the company's Web site at www.deneba.com.

 &HT;    Hey, candidates: Show a little life
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The presidential pregame show is already under way,
even though there's more than a year to go before the actual
election. In addition to political advisers and pollsters, the
candidates of the next millennium are also hiring gurus to design
Web sites that will engage voters, garner donations and keep the
media up to date on their latest campaign doings.
</P>
<P>
   As the trade magazine The Industry Standard put it, ``Move over
James Carville and Mary Matalin. There's a new breed of political
consultant out there, one that knows how to write (Web design code)
HTML.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, nobody's doing a particularly good job of online
campaigning. Despite some of the high-paid firepower employed by
some of the leading candidates, it appears the heavy artillery is
on hold. What we have now are primarily introductory Web sites,
offering information, travel agendas, speeches, slogans and secure
servers so Web surfers can make donations before hopping off to
eBay to bid on that Rocky and Bullwinkle vintage lunchbox.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's one bit of advice every political candidate and
his or her Web team must learn. Write it on a blackboard 500 times
if you must, just learn it.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is a visual, interactive medium. Yes, that's right,
in-ter-ac-tive. Remember, you are talking to people who are used to
posting book reviews on Amazon.com, complaining to Lands' End that
their weekly overstocks site has too many orange polo shirts and
clogging Yahoo! Finance message boards with hot Internet stock
tips.
</P>
<P>
   This is your chance to let people talk to you. Complain to you.
For heaven's sake, this is a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week town
meeting. Go for it. Post your best pictures. Provide excerpts from
your best speeches. Tell us when you'll be in our town. Ask us what
we care about. Maybe have us take a poll or two. Do something,
anything to make voters get involved with you and your Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In-ter-ac-tive. If you don't know what it means, ask one of your
college student volunteers. Then do it.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the presidential sites are wading into the Web waters
with so-so results. For example, Al Gore, self-described Net geek,
has a Web site that lives up to his reputation as a somewhat
less-than-colorful candidate. But as anyone who has seen the vice
president poking fun at himself with David Letterman knows, the
candidate does have a lighter side. Only pieces of it show on his
Web site, and as Ross Perot would say, ``That's just sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gore is online every day, the people who put his Web
site together might want to head back to the design studio for a
few pointers. The site posts Gore's speeches as just one long page
of plain text. No pictures, nothing, simply an endless stream of
pale blue text. Few political speeches are memorable barnburners
the ordinary citizen will want to read again and again. However, if
the candidate has a serious message to convey, pouring it onto the
Internet is not the way to do it. It's boring and doesn't give
voters much insight.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Town Hall section is the most interesting part of the
site, and he'd do well to put this kind of interactive feature on
all his pages, especially the ones with the deadly speeches.
Ordinary people ask questions, and Gore gives simple answers in a
chatty but dignified tone.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate could also learn a thing or two from the page
devoted to his wife, Tipper. The page is filled with pictures of a
smiling Tipper traveling the world, hugging children and jogging
with the Russian Olympic team. Should Gore win the election, Tipper
won't have the political influence of Hillary Rodham Clinton, but
here she's shown at her political and personal best.
</P>
<P>
   Another tip for aspiring presidential candidates: Register those
Web addresses early and often. Register every variation on your
name or campaign you can think of. Pay for it yourself. They're
only $70 each from Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, you'll find yourself in the unfortunate situation of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose late entry into the online
campaign left plenty of room for a parody site, www.gwbush.com. The
site's not quite as funny as some of the parody sites that popped
up in 1996, but it is still official-looking enough to prompt the
governor, the apparent Republican front-runner, to file a legal
complaint against the site, which lampoons his personal life and
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be limits to freedom,'' Bush told The Dallas
Morning News. Not good. Definitely not good with those
free-speech-loving, anti-regulation Internet types. Taken out of
context, it could be upsetting to a whole lot of people who've
grown fond of the First Amendment over the last 210 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush now has his own official Web site, www.georgewbush
</P>
<P>
   .com, which looks as if it were designed by the folks who did
the parody site. Also not good. However, it was the first bit of
online political excitement to date and a potential political
setback for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates all have miles to go before the Web becomes an
essential campaign tool. There's plenty of time to learn to use it
to its best advantage. It really does matter.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you feel like nobody ever listens and nobody ever
thinks you're old enough to do anything, you need to read about
Wyatt. ``Quiet, Wyatt!'' by Bill Maynard (G.P. Putnam's Sons,
$15.99) is a new book about a little boy who's determined to teach
his whole town a lesson _ he matters, too! Great for younger
readers, the book is easy to follow and has colorful illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper shows off his swing
</P>
<P>
   Slammin' Sammy Sosa may be the cover boy for Sports Illustrated
for Kids, but we want to read about Chipper Jones. The Braves'
third baseman is in the July issue teaching us how to switch-hit.
There are great action shots and step-by-step instructions. He also
offers other batting tips. The issue is available for $2.95.

 &HT;    Family photo album has gone high-tech
 &HT;    By Omar Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I have a cousin named Brianna whom, because of
work commitments, I wasn't able to see in person for a long time
after she was born.
</P>
<P>
   When she was about 2 years old, I opened my e-mail to discover a
huge, full-color photo of the baby sent by my parents. Immediately,
I got a breathless call from my mother. She wanted to make sure I
received the scanned photo, and of course, to comment on how cute
Brianna was. ``Que hermosa!'' my mom said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing my mother get excited about an infant isn't new, but
seeing her thrilled about a new piece of technology (in this case,
a scanner I'd lent her) is.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of other home users are getting excited, too, because PC
components like scanners, digital cameras, color printers and
editing software have dropped so far in price that even casual PC
users can turn their computers into photo editing studios.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just about price, although sub-$100 scanners and
ever-cheaper color printers have helped. The real reason why people
are turning to digital photos is that many users who only use their
computers for word processing or checkbook balancing have found a
killer application that is practical and truly useful.
</P>
<P>
   Digital photos are the culmination of several wants that
consumers have had and technological and pricing steps that are
fulfilling them. They are:
</P>
<P>
   _Storage _ Print photos decay, get lost, get torn up by angry
ex-spouses, get misfiled in family albums. The increasing size of
hard drives and the increasing number of storage options on PCs
(Zip drives, recordable CDs) make storing large numbers of large
photo files possible. Software makers like E-Book Systems have
created software like ``Digital Flip Album,'' which lets users
create slide shows and computerized photo albums.
</P>
<P>
   _Web development _ As more companies and individuals put up Web
pages, digital cameras and scanners have made it easy to turn
text-only Web pages into colorful, image-laden sites.
</P>
<P>
   _Easy mailing _ E-mail has made the near-instantaneous exchange
of data a reality. Being able to send photos to grandma with a few
clicks of a mouse button (provided she has an Internet account) is
a real-world, practical use for all the technology that the Intels
and Microsofts have been pushing all these years.
</P>
<P>
   _Easy transport _ Digital photos are pretty portable as it is,
with several dozen fitting on a single Zip disk, but future plans
are to make them even more so. Sony, for instance, has introduced
the Memory Stick, a plastic piece of memory that measures about the
size of a stick of gum. A memory stick will hold music, photos and
files and can transfer information between computers, digital
devices and even digital picture frames that can display an image
on a flat screen.
</P>
<P>
   _Photo editing _ Last week, Britain's new Earl of Wessex, Prince
Edward, had a royal photographer replace a glum-looking Prince
William from a photo of Edward's wedding with a happier image of
the young man using digital editing. While this may be a little
extreme, digital editing software can perform more simple tasks
like removing red-eye from photos, cropping a photo, erasing
smudges and spots on an image and even changing the background on a
picture. While it also makes it easier to doctor photos to suggest
alien abductions, photo editing can help correct problems in what
would otherwise be perfect pictures.
</P>
<P>
   _Quality and production _ The newer digital image products,
including mega-pixel digital cameras and high-resolution scanners,
produce much better-quality images than older models, which
sometimes produced grainy, pixelized pictures. A chief complaint
among early adopters was poor imaging, but as the technology has
improved, digital photos can now rival the sharpness and depth of
print photos. If that can be achieved without a stop at the
one-hour photo shop, consumers will find it more convenient.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that the digital revolution spells the end
of print photos, but print image giants like Kodak and Adobe have
been quick to produce software and Web sites that cater to home
users who want new ways to store and use photos.
</P>
<P>
   Archiving digital memories will continue to get cheaper and
easier, saving us more time and money to take photogenic vacations
that will end up in our PC scrapbooks.

 &HT;    Oohs and aahs tell the story of this minivan
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If I told you that minivans are the vehicles that
drive me to renew my driver's license, I'd be lying. They are the
dry toast of the automotive industry _ necessary, useful, but not
adrenaline-pumping.
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine my curiosity when I saw this look of pure
ecstasy come over a woman at the post office as she approached the
Honda Odyssey I was test driving. I understood her reaction when
she climbed into her own 10-plus-year-old minivan.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, it was a similar experience in the parking lot of
a local discount store, but this time, the driver was lusting from
a new minivan. Then, at a racetrack, the driver of a late-model
stock car who had just turned in a blistering qualifying lap was
more interested in talking about the Odyssey than his qualifying
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear it's got lots of room,'' he said. ``My neighbor
actually uses his to transport his son's competition go-kart and
all its spares on the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   I liked the Odyssey's 3.5-liter V-6 low-emissions VTEC engine,
the most powerful in the minivan segment. But I also liked the way
the Odyssey drove. Many minivans, when loaded down, tend to waddle
down the highway. To its credit, the Odyssey's handling
characteristics remained consistent whether fully loaded or with
just me driving. This could be because of the Odyssey's rear
double-wishbone suspension and gas-pressurized shocks.
</P>
<P>
   Odyssey's low entry threshold accommodates easy entry and exit.
Loaded, at highway speeds, the Odyssey gave better than 23 miles
per gallon. I also liked all the usable space.
</P>
<P>
   You really don't realize just how big a vehicle it is until you
go to wash it.
</P>
<P>
   The fold-down third seat is without question the best in the
industry. The Odyssey can have a perfectly flat floor from the rear
door all the way to the back of the front seats.
</P>
<P>
   I was fond of the little table between the two front bucket
seats. My initial reaction was that it would be flimsy and
impractical, but nothing could have been further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The minivan set knows its stuff. From women lusting in the
parking lots to racers looking for a new set of wheels, a 159.2
percent increase in Odyssey sales in May confirms the vehicle's
popularity.

 &HT;    Security systems offer comfort
 &HT;    By Karen Dean
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Say the words ``home security'' and what comes to
mind?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you envision a few simple deadbolt locks. Perhaps you
picture elaborate laser beams and infrared sensors that would put
the CIA to shame. Then again, your idea of home security may be
faithful Bitsy, the ankle-chewing Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you picture it, Americans are becoming more
security-conscious, and the home security industry is thriving.
According to the National Burglar and Fire Alarm Association,
Americans spent an estimated $14.8 billion on professionally
installed electronic security products and services in 1997 alone.
By the end of 1998, more than 20 percent of households were
estimated to be electronically protected.
</P>
<P>
   The reason seems to be that electronic protection works. Studies
have shown that homes without the benefit of security systems are
two to three times more likely to be burglarized than those
equipped with them. Since burglary is one of the least likely
crimes to be solved, with a rate of only 13.4 percent solved
nationwide, an alarm system may be a comforting solution.
</P>
<P>
   So you think you might want to join the wired brigade? Well, the
good news is that you won't have to cash in that 401(k) to pay for
the system. With prices ranging from $150 for a no-frills system to
upward of six figures for an intricate network of video,
multiple-entry monitoring and infrared sensors, there's a system
for just about every budget.
</P>
<P>
   Before you hop in the car to scope out what's available, take a
look around your house. The easiest and cheapest home protection
comes in the form of sturdy locks and window pins. Even with an
alarm, a thief has a few moments before police arrive, so securing
those entry points can go a long way toward keeping your property
in the house, where it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of any effective security system is to deter, delay
and detect,'' says Officer Ginger Smith of the Gwinnett County,
Ga., Crime Prevention Unit. ``Visible decals and a good combination
of locks, sensors and audible alarms can make your home less
appealing to a burglar.''
</P>
<P>
   Security systems come in two basic forms: hard-wired versions
and battery-operated wireless systems. The hard-wired system links
the indoor sensors to a central control panel by wiring run through
the house. Wireless systems operate by tiny transistors contained
in the door and window sensors that send radio frequencies to a
main control box. During an attempted break-in, either system sends
a message from the sensors to the main control board, activating
the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   While many industry experts continue to feel that hard-wired
systems are more reliable, the wireless alternatives are gaining
popularity and may be more practical in homes without ready access
to interior wiring, such as in an unfinished basement.
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding on any system, experts suggest you consider your
lifestyle and needs. Living with an alarm system requires
adjustments, like remembering to arm and disarm the alarm when
leaving or returning home. Children or indoor pets can make certain
alarms or motion sensors a nightmare to deal with, so you may need
a program with customizing options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many one-size-fits-all systems give a false sense of security
for the homeowner,'' says Jim Callahan of Ackerman Security. ``The
best choice is to have a trained consultant view your home with
you. The choice of options is still yours, but a professional
designer can make recommendations to best utilize the system for
your home.''
</P>
<P>
   Most alarm systems provide perimeter sensors that guard doors
and windows. You can then purchase additional sensors that offer
protection in case an intruder gets inside the house. Motion
detectors are often used to detect motion or heat changes in a
room, which trigger the alarm. Passive infrared motion sensors work
by detecting increases in temperature. But dual-technology sensors
are available that detect motion and heat simultaneously and may
reduce your risk of false alarms.
</P>
<P>
   When you finally decide on a system, you're not limited to
professional installation. The ``let me do it'' syndrome has
reached the security industry as well, and several local companies
offer products and advice for those willing to tackle the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``A knowledgeable do-it-yourselfer can often do as good a job as
many professional installers,'' says Craig Degrenier of
DeKalb-Gwinnett Alarm Co.
</P>
<P>
   A basic self-installed hard-wired system with control panel,
motion detector and three door-and-window sensors can be bought for
as little as $189, with extra window and door sensors for around $5
each and additional motion detectors starting at $30 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless components require a lot less effort to install and
about as much electronics knowledge as setting up a stereo. Place
your door and window sensors, set up for monitoring, and you're
ready to go. Plus, when you're ready to move, the system can be
packed up along with the dishes and taken to your new home.
Retailers such as Radio Shack, Home Depot and Lowe's sell the
wireless components, with prices starting at $150 for a console,
sensors for four doors or windows and a motion detector.
</P>
<P>
   A word of caution for budding do-it-yourselfers, though. Placing
the sensors correctly can make the difference between a
well-functioning alarm and one that consistently cries wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that magnetic contacts and motion detectors be
set and aimed accurately,'' says Bill Zelud, editor of Security
Distributing Magazine, an industry guide. ``Failing to place those
correctly can compromise the effectiveness of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you have made your choice _ hard-wired or wireless _ you're
left with the decision of whether to have the system monitored.
Monitoring is an optional cost, but many industry insiders feel
it's critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monitoring is the backbone and what makes the whole system
work,'' says Bruce Goldberg of Brinks. ``That's what guarantees a
quick response to your alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring company receives and verifies an alarm, then
notifies the appropriate law enforcement agency. With an
unmonitored audible alarm, you're relying on your neighbors to
finally get tired of hearing that noise and call the police. By
that time, your favorite VCR could be occupying the top shelf in
Bub's Pawn Palace.
</P>
<P>
   While many monitoring companies welcome self-installed
hard-wired systems, not all are so receptive. Many larger
companies, such as Ackerman, Brinks and ADT, will not monitor
systems that were not professionally installed because of concerns
regarding installation procedures or the risk of increased false
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring is also available for wireless components, with many
retailers offering services when you purchase your system. The
monitoring fees typically are $20 a month and up, often available
without a long-term commitment. But whether hard-wired or wireless,
shopping around in the competitive Atlanta market often results in
a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   Beside providing peace of mind, there may also be a bonus to
your wallet for having a home-security system. Many insurers offer
discounts up to 20 percent to policyholders with security systems.
However, monitoring or professional installation may be required
for the discount to apply, so check with your agent before spending
those savings.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever choice you make, the knowledge of an extra watchful
eye guarding your home and family can give you some added
assurances of safety. And give Bitsy a well-deserved rest.

 &HT;    If all else fails, think of the Web as tech support
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's the world's good fortune that I am not an airline
pilot or a brain surgeon. I learn best after making a horrible
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Microsoft sent me its Windows 98 Update, and I
installed it on my home computer. Everything seemed to go OK
through the installation process, but when the installation was
over, everything on my screen looked as if it had been drawn in
crayon. The colors were way off.
</P>
<P>
   So I clicked on the desktop screen with the right mouse button,
selected Properties and then selected the Settings tab to check the
video setup, since something was obviously wrong with the way
Windows set up my video card. Sure enough, Windows hadn't found the
driver (drivers are the small programs used by your PC to control
various devices such as modems, video cards, sound cards, scanners
and the like). So it installed a generic driver that comes with
Windows and _ as a result _ my computer could only work in its
lowest setting for graphics: 16-color mode. That's like trading in
your Ferrari for a used Yugo.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, I figured. I'll get the floppy disk that includes
the installation program for my Matrox video card. Then it's a
simple matter of opening up the Add/Remove Hardware icon in the
Control Panel folder, putting the disk in my A: drive and telling
the PC to use the video driver on the floppy.
</P>
<P>
   I moved back in September, and things are still in disarray. I
pawed through about 10 boxes of floppy disks _ found some that
contained copy for ads that I wrote back in the 1980s when I worked
for advertising agencies, found disks with old short stories I
tried to write, found everything but the disk for my video card.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the computer still worked fine in 16-color mode. I
could see the screen, and the modem still worked. So I popped over
to the Web site for Matrox, downloaded the drivers for my video
card and was back in business.
</P>
<P>
   That's lesson No. 1 today. The Web is an 24-hour tech support
center. If you need a driver or an update to a program you own,
check the Web first. Most often, you'll find the address for the
Web site in the printed material that came with the product. But
even if it isn't listed there, you can almost certainly find the
address by using one of the search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's move to lesson No. 2. If I had remembered this
lesson, I would have never needed lesson No. 1. Keep all your most
important disks _ the ones you'd need if you ever had to reinstall
Windows or if something goes wrong with your hard disk _ in one
spot. When you computer goes down, there's a natural sense of panic
anyway, and that's the worst time to start scattering the contents
of desk drawers around on a mad search. There will be times when
your computer won't work at all without the necessary disk, which
means you can't always depend on getting what you need from a Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson No. 3 caught me by surprise. When I finally found the
Matrox Web site I realized that, while I knew the name of the
manufacturer, I did not remember the specific model of video card
that I owned. Ordinarily, you could just pop over to the System
icon in the Control Panel folder and read the name under the
hardware section. But since Windows didn't recognize the card, that
option wasn't open to me.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't find the printed invoice that came with my computer,
nor could I find the manual for the video card. So that left me
with the option of opening up the computer to look on the video
card itself or tear into still another box of computer stuff.
Luckily, in this case Matrox has some generic drivers for idiots
such as myself _ these drivers work with all models of Matrox
cards.
</P>
<P>
   So my computer is up and running again. The new version of
Windows 98 is well-behaved. Things are in living color once again.
And I'm a little bit smarter.

 &HT;    Private technology leaders recognized
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a list for everything these days, and private
technology companies are no exception. The June issue of Upside
magazine lists what it considers the 100 top private technology
companies. The winners were picked, the magazine says, from some
1,000 contenders. Among those selected was Brocade Communications
Systems of San Jose, Calif. It makes fiber-channel switching
equipment used in digital networks. Another winner was Copper
Mountain Networks of Palo Alto, Calif. Copper Mountain makes a
technology that speeds up the digital telephone technology the Baby
Bells are trying to deploy.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   You can learn just about everything via computer these days, and
that includes music. Harmonic Vision, based in Evanston, Ill., has
released two computer CDs that teach kids the fundamentals of music
theory and how to read music. The CDs are called Music Ace and
Music Ace 2. The first program is for beginners, the second for
more advanced students. Each program retails for about $50. For
more information about the Music Ace CDs, check out the company's
Web site at www.harmonicvision.com. You can also download free
demos of the programs, which will work on both Macs and PCs, from
the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Edmark, a educational software company based in Seattle, has
released two new titles in its Thinkin' Things series. ``All Around
Frippletown'' uses the motif of a silly town to teach
problem-solving and logic. Edmark's second title uses a mystery
motif to teach the same skills in ``Sky Island Mysteries.'' Kids
help Inspector Cluestoe solve 14 mysteries. In doing so, they are
called on to gather information and draw conclusions. Each game is
available for either PCs or Macs and retails for about $30.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   There are tons of new developments in the Apple and Mac
community. A great way to keep up with all the changes is a Web
site called MacSurfer. It's a compendium of headlines and items
from the major Mac sites across the Web. Click on a headline, and
you'll jump right to the story. MacSurfer also maintains links to
sites that list software upgrades. You'll find MacSurfer at www
</P>
<P>
   .macsurfer.com.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the fastest way to look up information, but it does
work. Encyclopedia.com is a Web-based encyclopedia. You type in a
request in the search window, and the site presents a definition
and other information. You'll find this site at www

 &HT;    Read up before lighting the grill
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first time you tried to fake your way through
being an outdoor cook, you may have ended up with oxymoron meat:
charred but raw.
</P>
<P>
   Had there been a site like Better Homes and Gardens Online's
Summer Cooking School around, you might not have had to settle for
take-out that night.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.bhg.com/food/grillschool/, takes you through the
basics _ how to pile the charcoal, how much lighter fluid to use
and how to light the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Reading it will save you the trouble, and expense, of squirting
lighter fluid on a hill of coals as if you were trying to douse a
flame rather than start one. Once lit, the coals are supposed to be
left to heat up for at least 20 minutes. Mine sat for about 10
minutes, which is why the chicken cooked a bit unevenly.
</P>
<P>
   Grill-master mistakes are not limited to the charcoal grill, and
neither is the Web site's instruction.
</P>
<P>
   A separate section explains how to light a gas grill (one hint:
leave the lid up) and how to cook on and clean a gas grill.
</P>
<P>
   The site is divided into six sections: gas grilling basics,
charcoal grilling basics, key techniques, flavor enhancers, handy
utensils and grilling books.
</P>
<P>
   Study to determine what cell phone does to brain
</P>
<P>
   Ever wondered what holding a cell phone to your ear does to your
brain, but don't have time to hold it there for a few years to find
out?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at England's Bristol University have the time. A
mobile phone will be placed next to the ear of a model of a human
head for two years to study what high-frequency radio signals do to
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The July issue of Popular Mechanics magazine has that little
nugget. The magazine can also be reached online, at
www.popularmechanics.com.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the issue is a look at cell phones with Internet access
and a piece on how to goose your iMac so it is Windows-compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Ballparks.com offers a bit of sports-related nostalgia
</P>
<P>
   If you're a sports fan, stadiums and arenas are near-holy
places. If you're a sports fan older than 20, many of those
near-holy places are gone.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site called Ballparks.com is keeping the faith. The site,
www.ballparks
</P>
<P>
   .com, has photographs, trivia and details about old arenas and
ballparks from the major pro leagues of baseball, basketball,
hockey and football.
</P>
<P>
   For most ballparks, outdoor and indoor pictures are included.
The pages usually include interesting bits of trivia about each
stadium or arena. For example, who knew that Detroit's Tiger
Stadium has the only in-play flagpole in the major leagues?
</P>
<P>
   Even more worthwhile, the site has pictures _ sometimes
architectural drawings, sometimes construction images _ of new
stadiums and arenas, including Atlanta's Philips Arena and
Detroit's Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are links to official arena Web sites and official
ballpark Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bubbly artwork for the stars _ and you
</P>
<P>
   Now you, too, thanks to the Internet, can own what Lily Tomlin,
RuPaul, Rosanna Arquette and Frank Zappa's family own.
</P>
<P>
   The artwork of Allee Willis, a Grammy Award-winning Southern
California songwriter and artist, is selling really campy art under
the name Bubbles. You can see and buy her work at
bubblestheartist.com.
</P>
<P>
   Her paintings, which can be bought from the Web site, range in
price from $65 to $250.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers a catalog of Bubbles' work, searchable by items
in the painting. You can search by hairstyles or for ``paintings
with eyeglasses,'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   As a songwriter, Willis wrote the theme song for the TV show,
``Friends,'' as well as ``September,'' which was performed by
Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire.
</P>
<P>
   The art of Bubbles the Artist is collected by Tomlin, Paul,
Arquette and several Zappas.

 &HT;    DeLorme's Topo USA knows its terrain well
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ DeLorme, the most prolific and diverse publisher of
digital maps, has produced a topographical map of the United
States, available in one whopping big DVD disk or by regions on
single CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   While I am no cartographic expert, Topo USA seems a remarkable
achievement; the entire United States _ all 50 states _ in
topographical detail on a single disk, with a full complement of
bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing thing about the maps is the available detail.
You can zoom in to a scale of 100 feet to 1 inch, with contour
changes shown at intervals of 20 feet everywhere but in Alaska,
where the maximum is 100 feet. I was able to determine the
elevation of my own house.
</P>
<P>
   You can search for a geographic point, a town or a street
address, and all are produced remarkably quickly.
</P>
<P>
   There is a set of tools for drawing on a map, and a mode in
which you can set up a hiking trip, complete with waypoints. All
this can be saved as a separate map and printed out in case you
aren't lugging your laptop with you.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you are lugging the laptop, the map will
work with DeLorme's Global Positioning satellite receivers to show
you exactly where you are at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   The normal view is top down with standard indicators of
elevation change. As you move the cursor across the screen, a
window on the left side contains boxes that constantly change to
show the latitude and longitude, and the elevation, of the cursor
location. Upon your order, the view will shift to a 3-D elevation
that can be controlled in terms of angle and rotation. It is not a
great rendering, but it gives a good idea of the terrain.
</P>
<P>
   You can change the regular cursor to a ``query cursor,'' so that
clicking anywhere on the map provides information on the specific
location. This is most useful, as the maps are not cluttered with a
lot of place names. Ponds of 4-5 acres loom like the Great Lakes at
maximum zoom levels. Many creeks that doubtless have names are
relegated to the status of ``intermittent stream,'' but you can't
expect everything, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Topo USA is full of pleasant surprises. I asked it to
find Ingalls in Oklahoma, expecting no response. But the program
cogitated for a couple of seconds and then presented me with a map
of north central Oklahoma and a label pointing to Ingalls.
</P>
<P>
   This was a surprise because Ingalls no longer exists. More than
100 years ago it was an outlaw town, and became the scene of one of
the most epic gunbattles in Western history when a couple of
wagonloads of U.S. deputy marshals tried to capture the Doolin
gang. Now, however, none of the buildings remains and it is largely
blackjack thicket, a piece of history gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   Not in Topo, however, and to my delight, when I asked the
``query cursor'' to report on the location, it came back describing
Ingalls not as a town, but as a locale.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a hiker, but I love maps and Topo USA is a treat. The
DVD is priced at a very reasonable list of $100.

THE MICK HAD THE NAME, AND THE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 
1950s ATHLETE OF DECADE MICKEY MANTLE (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mickey Mantle was born and bred to be a baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Elvin (Mutt) Mantle, a zinc and lead miner in
eastern Oklahoma named Mickey in honor of Tigers' Hall of Fame
catcher, Mickey Cochrane. Mutt, who also played semipro baseball,
tutored his son from an early age and taught him to switch-hit.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Mantle went on to become the most feared switch-hitter in
baseball history as a member of the New York Yankees. QUOTE HERE He
began his major-league career in 1951, ultimately bridging two eras
of Yankees dynasties at the twilight of Joe DiMaggio's career.
Mantle helped lead the Yankees to six World Series titles in the
'50s (1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1956 and 1958).
</P>
<P>
   His best year statistically came in 1956 when he won the Triple
Crown, batting .353 with 52 home runs and 130 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   He led the American League in home runs three years in the
decade (1955, '56 and '58) and RBI four times (1954, '56, '57 and
'58). A three-time MVP, Mantle finished with 536 home runs but left
his fans wondering how much more he could have done if not for a
career shortened due in part to injuries and the toll of his
carousing off the field. Mantle battled through chronic knee pain
that originated in the '51 World Series when he tripped over a
sprinkler head going after a fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Mantle maintained a larger-than-life persona as
the greatest player on one of the greatest dynasties in sports
history.
Runners-up:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell: He who won two NCAA championships with San
Francisco in 1955 and 1956 and helped revolutionize the NBA game as
center for the Boston Celtics. Russell helped the United States to
a gold medal in the 1956 Olympics and led the Celtics to the NBA
title in 1957, starting a run in which they took 11 of 13
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Mays: Despite missing almost two seasons while in the
Army, Mays hit 250 home runs, drove in 709 runs and batted .317 in
the decade. His sprinting, back-to-the-infield, over-the-shoulder
catch of Vic Wertz's 440-foot drive to center field in the eighth
inning of Game 1 of the 1954 World Series helped ignite the New
York Giants to a four-game sweep of the Cleveland Indians, who had
won 111 regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hogan: The Fort Worth resident staged a remarkable comeback
from a near-fatal automobile accident that occurred in 1949. Hogan
won the U.S. Open in 1950, '51 and '53. In his greatest year, 1953,
he captured three major championships _ the U.S. Open, Masters and
British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Gordie Howe: The durable Howe teamed with Ted Lindsay and Sid
Abel on the famed ``Production Line'' that led the Red Wings to
Stanley Cup titles in 1950, 1952, 1954 and 1955.

COLLEGE ATHLETICS' UNDERSIDE REVEALED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1950, college basketball had finally arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Playing to a packed Madison Square Garden, City College of New
York defeated Bradley University, 69-61, in the National Invitation
Tournament championship game. Eight days later, they pulled an
unprecedented double by defeating Bradley again, 71-68, in the NCAA
Tournament championship.
</P>
<P>
   CCNY's ``Cinderella Team,'' led by super sophomores Eddie Roman,
Al Roth and Floyd Layne, appeared on the verge of becoming college
basketball's first big-time dynasty. But behind the scenes,
gamblers had gotten to CCNY's stars and convinced them to shave
points.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal wasn't unearthed until the 1950-51 season. On July
6, 1951, those three players were among 13 who pleaded guilty to
accepting bribes and shaving points.
</P>
<P>
   By the conclusion of New York district attorney Frank Hogan's
investigation, 33 players from seven schools, including CCNY,
Kentucky, Long Island University, Toledo and Bradley, had been
implicated in fixing 49 games in 23 cities. Overall, 90 games had
been discussed and a total of $72,950 had changed hands in bribes,
bringing the ascendant game to the brink of self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In a 63-page ruling, Judge Saul Streit blamed, among other
things, athletic scholarships, win-first philosophies, and
overzealous and overgenerous boosters for the manipulation of
often-impoverished students who fell prey to gamblers, mobsters and
bookies. He insisted that ``everyone is doing it'' and that players
should get a piece of the financial windfall that basketball
brought the colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds familiar, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the players in the '51 scandals were banned from
collegiate and professional basketball, the temptations outweighed
the punishment. As they do to this day. In 1997, two former Arizona
State players pleaded guilty to attempting to shave points in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA last week concluded a two-year study on gambling. It
supports a recommendation to restrict legal gambling to those over
age 21 and to ban legal betting on college and amateur events.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way we keep our sanity around here is that we admit we're
not going to solve the problem,'' said Bill Saum, who heads the
NCAA's investigations into gambling. ``It's not going to go away.
But we're trying to have a dramatic effect on those who wish to
wager and a dramatic effect on any individual who may even think
about point shaving.''

SPURS START TALKING ABOUT POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The NBA has come full circle in the '90s: from
Detroit's Bad Boys to San Antonio's Choir Boys.
</P>
<P>
   After capping their dominating run through the playoffs with a
4-1 Finals romp against the New York Knicks, the Sunday School
Spurs yesterday headed back to the Alamo City praising their
wholesome foundation, dismissing talk of their title being tainted
and already chatting up a repeat in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got as good a chance as anybody else,'' said Finals MVP
Tim Duncan, who poured in 31 points in Friday night's clinching
Game 5. ``I think the major pieces will be back, and there's no
reason to think we won't get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goody Two Sneakers Spurs, whose major controversy this
season was deciding which warm-ups to wear for pregame layups, hit
the trifecta by winning their first championship in the franchise's
26-year history. Not only do they get a summerlong fiesta on the
Riverwalk, they also provided momentum for the funding of a new
basketball-only arena and, in turn, gave Duncan motivation to
remain in San Antonio when his contract expires after next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was huge, bigger than just the moment,'' Spurs owner
Peter Holt said. ``Hopefully we'll look back someday and point to
this \RGame 5\S as where the dynasty really started rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidenced by television ratings only slightly higher than a
late-night psychic hotline infomercial and a mundane game plan
founded on the rugged defense of 7-foot Twin Towers Duncan and
David Robinson, the Spurs don't keep fans on the edge of their
seats. But the NBA might as well sit back and get comfortable
watching, because they will likely be around for a while. The
nucleus of Duncan, Robinson, Sean Elliott, Mario Elie and Avery
Johnson return next season. Among the team's key contributors, only
Jaren Jackson and Malik Rose are scheduled to become free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a great chance to win another one,'' Elie
said. ``If we just stay healthy I don't see why not.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lockout that canceled 32 regular-season games,
the absence of Michael Jordan and a Finals matchup against a
depleted, eighth-seeded Knicks team, some critics are calling for
an asterisk on San Antonio's title. New York played without center
Patrick Ewing, and key players Larry Johnson and Chris Childs were
hobbled by knee injuries. New Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson
last week called the entire postseason ``tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what Phil says, I'm going to cherish this ring
and wear it proud,'' Elie said. ``Lockout or not, every team we
played in the playoffs wanted to win just as much as we did.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, previously known as the birthplace of barbed wire,
chili and Carol Burnett, now boasts an NBA champion that politely
asked its place into history with a simplistic coach (Gregg
Popovich), a point guard (Johnson) who once was cut on Christmas
Eve, a superstar (Duncan) who grew up with dreams of being an
Olympic swimmer, and a defense that held the Knicks to a Finals
record-low 79.8 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   In the clincher, the Spurs held New York's Allan Houston
scoreless in the fourth quarter and shut the Knicks out the final
3:12 to rally for a dramatic 78-77 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grinded it out, like we did most of the season,'' said
Robinson, whose team became the first former American Basketball
Association team to win the NBA's title. ``When all else failed,
our defense was there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, born from the death of the old Dallas Chaparrals in
1973, started the season 6-8 but won 46 of their final 53 games.
Their 15-2 playoff run _ which included a record 12-game winning
streak _ tied for the second-best in league history, validating the
career of Robinson and giving redemption to the undrafted Johnson.
Once cut by the Denver Nuggets on Christmas Eve, released by the
Spurs while still in his tuxedo from attending Robinson's wedding,
and labeled a loser who would never lead a team to a title by
Portland Trail Blazers guard Damon Stoudamire, the little guard
with the big heart swished the series-clinching jumper with 47
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole team is a great example to a lot of kids, even a lot
of adults, of what kind of good things can happen to those who
persevere,'' Johnson said. ``After all I've been through, I can't
believe I'm here under these circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Spurs celebrated their transformation of eras from
Iceman George Gervin-to-Nice Guys by popping the tops off several
O'Doul's, the Knicks were left to only wonder how the series might
have been different had they had a healthy lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them not having Patrick killed them, that's no secret,'' Elie
admitted. ``With him, they probably would have pushed us to a Game
7.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's Summer of San (Antonio) ended because Larry Johnson
couldn't hit a 3-pointer and they couldn't keep Texas' version of
the World Trade Center towers off the boards at crucial times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great run, and I think everyone in our locker room
really believed we could win,'' said Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy,
who, along with Latrell Sprewell and Ewing, is committed to return
to New York next season. ``San Antonio just didn't give us much
margin for error.''

WOMEN'S SOCCER MOVES FROM SHADOWS TO SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   California-born Brandi Chastain has been telling reporters about
the first time that Team USA returned from the Women's World Cup of
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   When the Americans got off the plane from China that day in
1991, a lone newspaper guy was there at the New York airport to
greet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How'd ya do?'' the man asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won,'' Chastain answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good deal,'' the guy nodded, jotting something down in a
notebook.
</P>
<P>
   And that, Chastain said, was pretty much the extent of Mia Hamm
and Company's triumphant soccer return.
</P>
<P>
   No ``Sports Illustrated'' commemorative issue. No Sportswon
T-shirt tent sales. Not even a wisecrack from David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long way, therefore, from Beijing to Foxboro, Mass.,
where a team of U.S. women will play soccer in front of an expected
crowd of 50,000 today. Last weekend's World Cup opener at Giants
Stadium in New Jersey drew 78,972.
</P>
<P>
   They can't all be there to watch Mia Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, an intriguing alignment of planets is taking place. We are
the home team. We are a land of soccer moms. And in this sport, for
the most part, we can still kick the world's butts.
</P>
<P>
   You go, girls.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything, of course. In this country, the
renaissance of the female athlete began with the flowering of
Florence Griffith Joyner, Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Evelyn Ashford _
Olympic track champions all.
</P>
<P>
   Title IX, in turn, secured the seed money that allowed women's
soccer programs to flourish at places like North Carolina and
softball teams at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   The women who first burst through the locker-room door 10 years
ago are now the soccer moms. Some are even the head coaches or
married to one.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, soccer players were blessed by being
unencumbered by old-school notions. As recently as 10 years ago in
Brazil, where soccer sambas through their veins, the notion of
women playing the national game was ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer was too rough, they said. Too physical. Without an
established professional league, it was seen in Brazil as too much
of a waste of a woman's time.
</P>
<P>
   But American women haven't had to fight that. Unlike the men,
young U.S. females aren't steered toward football and baseball at a
young age. Thus, Hamm and Michelle Akers are soccer players.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the men, they haven't had to go through life being asked,
``Hey, what's with the knee socks?''
</P>
<P>
   They're good. They should be. And unlike in basketball, where
the women's game continues to suffer from comparison to the men's,
American audiences view women's soccer with minimal preconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   When they see Team USA score seven consecutive goals against the
Nigerians _ seven _ something tells them that this isn't their
fathers' soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Nike'' commercials showing Hamm throwing Michael Jordan to
the mat are priceless. You don't need to be a soccer dad to see the
intended symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dispatches from the United States' 3-0 opening
victory over Denmark sniffed that, yes, the crowd was 78,972 but
that there were ``rumors of ticket giveaways.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me? The U.S. team that finished 32nd of 32 teams at last
year's men's World Cup couldn't have given away even a sniff of
that many tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The men's national team has changed coaches and is in midstream
of an earnest rebuilding job, one that maybe will even be able to
beat Iran three years from now. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamm and Company are good now, and in this country that can
have an irresistible appeal. In overall World Cup play dating back
to 1991, the U.S. women are 12-1-1 going into today's match against
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   They almost certainly will advance to the quarterfinal round,
despite the fact that they play with the fate of women's soccer in
America on their shoulders. The Brazil women may be worse _ they
carry an entire continent's female soccer future.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians wear the familiar canary jerseys and even have
the solo names of their male counterparts. Watch out for Sissi and
Pretinha and the goalkeeper whose name is Maravilha, Portuguese for
``marvelous.''
</P>
<P>
   A championship run for the U.S. women could mean the birth of a
North American professional league. Just as women have supported
the WNBA _ a reported 72 percent of their tickets are bought by
females _ the same audience might one day support soccer teams with
Hamm, Chastain, Julie Foudy and Briana Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, only one country, Australia, has bid to host the
2003 Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   You go, girls. Timing, remember, is everything.

ODOM'S TALENT, IMMATURITY HAVE bULLS WAFFLING ON NO. 1 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wally Szczberiak is climbing. Corey Maggette is
sliding. Lamar Odom is somewhere doing 360s.
</P>
<P>
   And, most important, Jerry Krause isn't talking.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the 1999 NBA draft, where mediocre talent and
immature personalities have the lottery-winning Bulls still
uncertain if their pick is priceless, or prize-less.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a consensus No. 1 guy, that's for sure,'' said
Bulls coach Tim Floyd, who will defer to general manager Krause
Wednesday night at Washington's MCI Center. ``There are still a lot
of ways we can go. There's some feeling toward taking a couple of
different players, and trading down also seems to make some
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, trying to rebuild their franchise in the wake of
Krause's dismantling of the Michael Jordan-Scottie Pippen-Phil
Jackson dynasty last summer, believe Odom is the best physical
prospect in the draft. But, like every team except the Vancouver
Grizzlies, they haven't interviewed him or gotten the chance to
work him out privately.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Odom, a 6-foot-10 guard/forward from Rhode
Island, left school after one season, hired an agent, fired him,
tried to withdraw from the draft and re-enter school, and now has
gone into hiding in the last week when told he couldn't regain his
college eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   With unlimited range on his left-handed jumper and ball-handing
skills of a point guard, Odom has teams licking their chops. But he
also has them scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to see him because we think he's a great talent,''
Krause said. ``But it's difficult when you haven't had a chance to
spend time with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rhode Island coach Jerry DeGregorio, ``If Lamar says he'll
meet you Thursday at 8, he'll be there. The only question is what
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts figured Odom was Chicago's top choice before his
recent flip-flop flip-out. Now, the Bulls are apparently wavering
between the safe choice of Duke power forward Elton Brand and
trading the top pick to the Toronto Raptors for forward Tracy
McGrady and the fifth pick, which they would use to select Miami,
Ohio, small forward Szczberiak. The Raptors, in desperate need of a
point guard to play alongside rookie of the year Vince Carter,
covet Maryland's Steve Francis.
</P>
<P>
   In a peculiar draft in which six teams own multiple first-round
picks and nine teams _ including the Mavericks _ are without one,
there are likely to be several draft-day trades. For example, the
Utah Jazz (with picks No. 19, 24 and 28) is attempting to use its
three selections to move into the top 10, and the Atlanta Hawks
(Nos. 17, 20, 21 and 27) are looking to exchange their picks for a
proven veteran scorer like Golden State's John Starks.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls (1 and 16), Cleveland Cavaliers (8 and 11) and
Minnesota Timberwolves (6 and 14) have the most leverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are basically five options in this draft,'' said Raptors
general manager Glen Grunwald. ``After Brand, Francis, Szczberiak,
Odom and \RUCLA point guard Baron\S Davis, it's wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand measured a surprisingly tall 6-foot-8 in his socks and
impressed scouts with his soft hands, and teammate Maggette has
shot horribly during private workouts. The draft's strong suit is
point guards, with Francis, Davis, Utah's Andre Miller, Duke's
William Avery and Arizona's Jason Terry. It could be, however, the
worst draft ever for centers, with 7-foot-3 Yugoslavian Alek
Radojevic the best of a group of Eric Montross clones that includes
Northwestern's Evan Eschmeyer and Washington's Todd MacCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's Lee Nailon is widely considered the fourth-best power
forward behind Brand, Mississippi high-schooler Jonathan Bender and
New Mexico's Kenny Thomas, and is projected as a late first-round
pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as big men, you have Brand,'' said Scott Layden, Jazz
vice president of basketball operations, ``and after that it gets
sketchy.''
Up for grabs ``Star-Telegram'' NBA writer Richie Whitt takes a look
at how the top 10 picks in Wednesday's NBA Draft might shake down:
No. Team Player Pos. Height School Comment 1. Chicago Bulls Elton
Brand F 6-8 Duke If they don't trade down, Brian Grant-prototype is
best of a horrible big-man crop 2. Vancouver Grizzlies Lamar Odom
G/F 6-10 Rhode Island Out of Randy Moss syndrome, can't pass on the
draft's best talent despite immaturity 3. Charlotte Hornets Steve
Francis G 6-3 Maryland Allen Iverson-type skills would fit well in
backcourt with Eddie Jones 4. LA Clippers Baron Davis G 6-3 UCLA
Rare breed in that he is a talented player who actually wants to
play for the Clippers 5. Toronto Raptors William Avery G 6-2 Duke

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 27, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Supreme Court rules. That was
the message of a term in which the court asserted its power over
every branch and level of government, few of which emerged
unchanged from the encounter. By Linda Greenhouse. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   STATE-POLITICS-REVIEW (Albany, N.Y.) _ Washington has been
transferring power to the states on matters like welfare, providing
lawmakers with more to wrangle over and drawing more interest
groups into the fray. State authority was further strengthened by
last week's Supreme Court decisions that placed curbs on Congress'
ability to make federal law binding on the states. By Clifford J.
Levy.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-CONGRESS-REVIEW (Washington) _ When Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas made a triumphant visit to Capitol Hill last week,
congressional Republicans grabbed hold of him as if he were a life
raft that could sail them all to victory. But their clutch left
some in both parties predicting that Bush's Washington allies would
only weigh down his campaign. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   COKE-APOLOGY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Unlike being in love, being in
business sometimes means having to say you're sorry. Last week the
chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola Co. issued one of the
more elaborate public apologies by an American business leader. By
Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-LAWSUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Last week an independent
scientific panel reported that the courts had been wrong in saying
that breast implants caused serious disease. The battle over
implants, and similar cases in which courts appear to have reached
incorrect scientific conclusions, has meant that judges often
restrict the scientific evidence that can be presented to jurors.
By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCT-DESIGN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Age isn't the only thing
creeping up on the baby-boom generation. Consumer product design
and marketing are too, like wolves on cattle. By William L.
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   MAKEOVERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ If you are appearance-challenged,
you are hitting speed bumps on today's exciting but fiercely
competitive job superhighway, where Youth and Beauty are zooming
past in Ferraris. You are just the candidate for a Millennium
Makeover. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   BALKAN-NATIONS (Rome) _ Nearly a decade after the old Yugoslavia
began to break up, President Clinton visited the thriving, peaceful
land of Slovenia a week ago, and then saw bedraggled Albanian
refugees waiting to return to Kosovo. The contrast could not have
been greater. A glance at the four newly independent lands _
Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia _
illustrates how differently they are faring now. By John Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   EURO-FOOD-SCARES-REVIEW (Paris) _ Last month, researchers at
Cornell published findings that genetically altered corn, designed
to produce pollen toxic to pests, could also kill caterpillars of
the monarch butterflies, whose principal breeding range is the U.S.
corn belt. Americans heard this news with a momentary shrug of
disapproval. But in the European Union, environmental officials are
taking the news much more seriously. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   GERM-WARFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ken Alibek was a military
physician in the Soviet Union. Like every doctor, he took an oath
to preserve life and guard against medical abuse. But after doing
so, he devoted himself for 17 years not to healing but to the
science of germ warfare _ devising new ways of harnessing deadly
microbes to maim and kill people. Among his killers were smallpox,
anthrax, tularemia and plague. By William J. Broad.

 &HT;    END-OF-CENTURY CONGRESS SPENDS $2 BILLION ON ITSELF
 &HT;    With CONGRESS-COST-DATA. For release Sunday, July 4.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As fireworks etch the skies with bright colors for
the last Independence Day of this century, the majestic dome of the
U.S. Capitol will look much as it did 99 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But almost everything else about Capitol Hill has changed in a
century that brought an explosion of staff, construction and
bureaucracy _ not to mention lobbyists _ to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the century's start, lawmakers had no suites of offices, only
their desks on the floor of the Senate and House, and only a rare
clerk to help with their part-time legislative duties.
</P>
<P>
   Today Congress operates the equivalent of a fair-sized city,
with 29,000 employees, its own police force, six major office
buildings and an underground trolley system to move lawmakers to
and from the Capitol whenever the bell rings for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the expense of running the Library of Congress,
the legislature now costs more than $2.2 billion a year, expected
to reach $2.4 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
   House members, who averaged only about three aides each as
recently as 1947, now employ an average of 15 full-time aides in
the capital or in their home districts. Senators, who had fewer
than six staff members each in 1947, now have about 40 aides.
</P>
<P>
   Under Republican majority since 1995, Congress has pared its
payroll by more than 8,800 compared with 1991. But the overall
growth in the legislature's bureaucracy remains largely intact.
</P>
<P>
   What spurred the congressional expansion?
</P>
<P>
   Starting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, lawmakers began
fearing their powers were slipping away to the more assertive
executive branch. Congress responded by bulking up its staff in the
late 1940s. That effort was redoubled in the 1970s, when Congress
added yet more staff, researchers and investigators, and set up its
own budget office as a counterpoint to the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Congress enlarged its operations to keep pace with new
benefit programs, regulations and agencies it was creating.
Lawmakers, who once concentrated their efforts in the capital,
began hiring more staff for home offices, where aides serve as
``caseworkers'' for constituent who have problems with programs
ranging from the Environmental Protection Agency to Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, an army of lobbyists began camping in
Washington. By 1997, the ranks included 11,500 registered lobbyists
whose organizations spent $1.26 billion to try to influence
law-making, according to the private, nonpartisan Center for
Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all moved together,'' said Thomas E. Mann, director of
governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. ``The agenda of
government expanded. The size of congressional staffs, the number
of organizations with representatives in Washington and the number
of registered lobbyists _ they all went up together.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; HEMINGWAY'S CHAIR &LR;  By Michael Palin. St. Martin's Griffin,
$12.95. In his first novel, a former member of Monty Python's
Flying Circus tells the story of a sweet-tempered postal worker
with a Papa obsession who is driven batty when his small-town post
office is privatized. Last year our reviewer, Bruce Weber, praised
the book's ``dry, deftly understated wit,'' ``hearty, well-formed
sentences'' and ``clever, on-the-money dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PACK OF TWO: THE INTRICATE BOND BETWEEN PEOPLE AND DOGS &LR;  By
Caroline Knapp. Delta, $12.95. This affectionate account of the
author's two-year relationship with Lucille, a 45-pound shepherd
mix she rescued from an animal shelter, is both an unabashed love
letter and a commentary on the power of dogs to open the human
heart. It's also full of canine lore, childhood memories and
testimonials from many other dog owners. ``Knapp's dogs come
bounding to life on the page,'' Susan Cheever wrote in the Book
Review in 1998. ``They bark and paw at the covers. They watch us
with bemusement and acceptance. ... She's written a funny,
instructive and completely enjoyable book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROXANNA SLADE &LR;  By Reynolds Price. Scribner, $13. The narrator
of this graceful, old-fashioned novel is a strong-willed Southerner
in her 90s who looks back on her life's gains and losses, as well
as those of our century. Last year our reviewer, Janet Burroway,
called the author ``a chronicler of decency, pluck and joy'' who
has ``given us the weight and worth of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SARATOGA: TURNING POINT OF AMERICA'S REVOLUTIONARY WAR &LR;  By
Richard M. Ketchum. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $15.95. Drawing on a wide
range of sources, including the diaries of officers and soldiers,
the author explains why the colorful British general John Burgoyne
failed in his 1777 invasion of the Colonies from Canada, and why
his surrender was so critical to the war's outcome. ``The strength
of `Saratoga' lies in his vivid descriptions of the rugged
landscape and in his many arresting portraits of participants,''
Pauline Maier wrote here in 1997. The same publisher has reissued
Decisive Day: The Battle for Bunker Hill ($12.95), in which Ketchum
reconstructs the 1775 campaign to control the Charlestown
peninsula, a bloody affair marked by confusion and wrongheadedness
in both the British and American camps. ``It was a furious action
and a chilling spectacle,'' which Ketchum describes ``in handsome
style,'' Bruce Bliven Jr. wrote in these pages in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A BLESSING ON THE MOON &LR;  By Joseph Skibell. Berkley, $12. In
this first novel, the spirit of a Jewish man killed in wartime
Poland ascends from a mass grave to roam the countryside, guided by
his murdered rabbi, who has turned into a crow. His journey
``illuminates the horror of history through the energy and wisdom
of fantasy and myth; scene after scene is rich with emotion, humor
and invention,'' Patrick Giles wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAGING THE GENIES: A WORKABLE SOLUTION FOR NUCLEAR, CHEMICAL,
AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS &LR;  By Stansfield Turner. Westview, $14. A
former director of central intelligence offers a detailed plan for
reducing the global stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. His
slender book, which has been updated, ``is more than an
arms-control proposal,'' one critic wrote in 1997. ``It is a
readable primer on nuclear weapons and strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GREAT HILL STATIONS OF ASIA &LR;  By Barbara Crossette. Basic
Books, $15. The U.N. bureau chief for The New York Times tours the
mountaintop villages of southern Asia that were built by American
and European colonialists seeking refuge from the scorching
malarial summers. ``The region's history, politics, religion and
economics are brilliantly summarized,'' Alexander Frater said here
last year. ``Yet she also maintains a lively social curiosity.''
The Idea of India, by Sunil Khilnani (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$13), is a scholarly analysis focusing on the growth of the modern
Indian state and the evolution of one of the world's most intensely
political societies. ``Khilnani writes with illuminating dexterity,
wit and compassion,'' Judith Brown wrote here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE EBONY TOWER &LR;  By John Fowles. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.
This collection of four stories and a translation of a medieval
French fable is steeped in the author's continuing fascination with
the power of art to redefine the terms of human freedom. ``If you
haven't been reading Fowles,'' you'll find these tales ``magical
enough,'' Theodore Solotaroff wrote here in 1974. ``If you have ...
you'll have the pleasure of making connections.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE NOTEBOOKS OF DON RIGOBERTO &LR;  By Mario Vargas Llosa. Penguin,
$12.95. This wickedly promiscuous novel is about the sexual
escapades of a wealthy Peruvian couple and their son _ or is it the
fantasy of a bored insurance executive? ``Vargas Llosa's complex,
gorgeous prose ... sweeps the reader into a rich confusion of art
and fact, fiction and reality,'' Walter Kendrick wrote here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HUNGER MOON &LR;  By Suzanne Matson. Ballantine, $12. Three
women of different ages find a way to soothe their loneliness and
suffering when their lives intersect in a Boston suburb. In 1997
our reviewer, Sarah Lyall, admired this first novel's ``crisp,
clean writing'' and ``compassionately drawn characters.''

   HIGHLIGHTS OF CONGRESSIONAL EXPENDITURES
</P>
<P>
   Based on legislative appropriations proposed for fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE LEADERSHIP AND POLITICAL PARTY OFFICES: $14.2 million
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., $1.74 million for his
leadership office plus $406,000 for staff to handle House floor
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Minority leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is divided among other leaders and congressional party
organizations that set strategy and policy, chiefly for staff
salaries. Here's how some of the rest of the leadership money is
spent:
</P>
<P>
   _ More than $17,600 on travel, most of it for a Democratic
retreat at the Wintergreen resort in Virginia with President
Clinton at the end of his impeachment crisis in February. Meeting
rooms and audio-visual equipment rental cost about $6,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refreshments and meals for strategy meetings of the Republican
House Conference (ranging from $31.50 for Dunkin' Donuts to $1,229
for a December session).
</P>
<P>
   _ Balloons ($92.53), listed as ``supplies for official meeting''
of the Republicans in February.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE LEADERSHIP AND POLITICAL PARTY OFFICES: $11.6 million
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., receive $1.3 million each for their leadership
operations, and the rest is divided among the other party leaders
and party organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Among expenses reported this year:
</P>
<P>
   _ Senate Republicans totalled more than $13,000 in television
satellite feeds to beam their members' comments to the public
during the first two months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Senate Democrats reported spending $1,545 for satellite feeds
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   VICE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE
</P>
<P>
   Although Al Gore was elected vice president of the United
States, the job that provides his salary and much of his staff is
his post as president of the Senate. Under the Constitution, the
vice president presides over the upper chamber and votes to break
ties. Gore rarely goes to Capitol Hill, but the legislative branch
nevertheless pays $1.7 million a year to support about 30 members
of his staff, most of whom are based in the White House complex.
Congress also gives Gore a $10,000 annual expense account.
</P>
<P>
   OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the senior Republican
member of the chamber, serves in the largely ceremonial post whose
chief duty is to open the Senate's daily sessions. ``Few presidents
pro tem in the 20th century have had much influence in the
Senate,'' says Congressional Quarterly's Guide to Congress. The
position includes an 11-person staff and costs $404,000. The Senate
is considering a $33,000 increase for next year. ``The biggest
thing is he is third in line for the presidency,'' said Thurmond's
spokesman John DeCrosta. Otherwise, the spokesman said that the
staff has ``various and sundry'' duties, such as scheduling
Thurmond's appearances.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   COMMITTEES:

</P>
<P>
   Staff, expenses for 19 Senate committees: $78.1 million
</P>
<P>
   Staff, expenses for 2 joint committees: $9.4 million
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR MEMBERS:
</P>
<P>
   _ Office of attending physician: $1.9 million (House members pay
$290 a year, senators pay $520 a year for unlimited office visits,
hospital visits, lab work, and other treatment).
</P>
<P>
   _ Free treatment at Walter Reed Army Hospital or Bethesda Naval
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   _ Government-financed health insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESSIONAL PENSIONS: $20 million
</P>
<P>
   Retirement benefits for members of Congress are calculated at a
higher rate than for other federal employees and include annual
cost of living increases, which few private plans offer. Pensions
this year average $60,000 per retired lawmaker, according to the
National Taxpayers Union. These funds are not counted in the annual
legislative appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE: $2 million
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1995, Congress voted to require itself to follow 11
laws already enacted for the rest of the country on workplace
health and safety and non-discrimination. However, Congress has
arranged its own system of enforcement that does not hold
lawmakers, or their office budgets, individually responsible. For
example, employees can charge a member of Congress with employment
discrimination, and any settlement paid comes from taxpayer funds,
with all records kept secret. Only a handful of appeals have gone
into the courts, where the cases become public.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL POLICE: $85 million
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 officers patrol the Capitol grounds and
surrounding neighborhoods and provide bodyguard protection to top
congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   BOTANIC GARDEN: $3.5 million
</P>

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending June 19 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

MILLENNIUM MAKEOVERS FOR THE APPEARANCE-CHALLENGED

   From the Desk of Giancarlo LaMans, Director, Millennium
Makeovers Ltd.:
</P>
<P>
   Face it, friends. If you are appearance-challenged, you are
hitting speed bumps on today's exciting but fiercely competitive
job superhighway, where Youth and Beauty are zooming past in
Ferraris.
</P>
<P>
   You may have seen an article in The New York Times last week
with the headline ``The Chef as Beefcake.'' The message was as
arresting as some of the buff studs pictured, one naked except for
a well-placed blender: A great chef can no longer be just a pudgy,
marginally psychotic tyrant who cooks like an angel. No! Today's
top chef is a sex kitchen utensil who writes cookbooks with titles
like ``Boy Meets Grill.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most of us prefer the cooking staff to be clothed at all
times, that's beside the point. In careers all across America, the
homely, flabby, balding and aged are Out. The young and beautiful
are In. How about that article on the ``aerobic pop-star'' Padre
Marcelo, who's packing the churches in Brazil?
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe you were born before the Carter administration and
have the silhouette of a sack of potatoes. We here at Millennium
Makeovers are dedicated to the proposition that Sex Appeal boosts
any career! Let me describe a few examples from our great selection
of professional services, available at the more than 250 Millennium
Makeovers Career-Buffing Centers:
</P>
<P>
   BUSMAN'S HOLIDAY: Both Gotham Bus Co. and Alice Kramden would
have been a lot happier if one of Ralph's bright ideas had been to
join Millennium Makeovers' exercise program for those carrying a
wide load. Our staff lead bus drivers in aerobic ``Get on Board,
the Engine's Revved'' sessions. Exact change only. No smoking,
spitting, radio playing!
</P>
<P>
   BYTES `R' US: Intense workout for pasty computer programmers
looking for an upgrade. Graduates receive T-shirts that say ``Giga
Dude'' or ``Giga Gal.''
</P>
<P>
   PUMPED-UP PLUMBERS: Exercise workout for plumbers with an extra
twist: Once they can get their new ``fittings'' in Spandex bike
shorts, they attend self-esteem sessions. Graduates receive a
T-shirt with the slogan ``Plumbers Are Lovers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this is all quite interesting, Giancarlo,'' I hear you
say. ``But what if I'm a lazy professional who doesn't want to go
to the gym with bus drivers and computer nerds?'' Not to worry, my
friend! Millennium Makeovers has a marketing staff that is working
overtime just for you.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-JACKET BOFFO: So your new novel reads like F. Scott
Fitzgerald but you look like Barry Fitzgerald. Tired of ending up
on the remaindered table while the crowds elbow past for books with
jacket photos of hunks who, inexplicably, have time to write?
</P>
<P>
   No sweat! We simply sell you a new face for your book jacket,
drawing from our vast archive of Unclaimed Fashion Model and
Theatrical Publicity Photos. Proven results! I'll bet you didn't
suspect that the Post-Feminist Siren-Scribe Naomi Wolf is actually
an 87-year-old former researcher for the WPA Writers Project. Or
that Sebastian Junger, hunkster-author of ``The Perfect Storm,'' is
really a 98-pound weakling who hasn't had a real photo taken since
that unfortunate barracuda accident off Barbados in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium Makeovers also offers youth-enhancing apparel like:
</P>
<P>
   HABEAS CORPUS: Our ``hip'' line of sexy designer underwear for
that ambitious lawyer who wants to ``court'' new clients. Items can
be personalized with sayings like: ``Sustained!'' or ``Motion?
Here's Your Motion, Pal.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait, there's more! We've produced smash classical music CD
packages like ``Vivaldi Violin Vixens,'' ``Baywatch Beethoven'' and
``The Ring-a-Ding-Ding Cycle'' sung by Frank Sinatra and the Rat
Pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fat lady sings?'' Not if Millennium Makeovers can help it!

COCA-COLA HOPES THINGS GO BETTER WITH `SORRY'

<P>
   Unlike love, being in business sometimes means having to say
you're sorry. Last week, the chairman and chief executive of
Coca-Cola Co. issued one of the more elaborate public apologies by
an American business leader. In newspaper ads in Belgium on Tuesday
that followed an outright ban on the company's products after
reports of people becoming sick, Douglas Ivester said ``I'm sorry''
or ``we regret'' or ``I apologize'' five times.
</P>
<P>
   The ban, which began on June 14 and spread to France, Luxembourg
and the Netherlands a day later in varying degrees, turned into the
largest recall of Coke products in history and created a
public-relations mess for the company. Ivester's apology in the
newspaper was the second issued in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   But what are the ramifications of saying ``Sorry'' in
circumstances like Belgium's, where the government says 249 people
reported symptoms like nausea, dizziness and vomiting after
drinking Coke? One expert says it neither opens the way to lawsuits
nor prevents them _ but ought to be done nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of saying you're sorry, if it's genuine, is to say
you're sorry,'' said Steven Fink, president of Lexicon
Communications, a public relations firm that was called in by
Foodmaker Inc. after three children died from eating contaminated
hamburgers from its Jack in the Box restaurants. ``It should come
from the heart, and it should come swiftly.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies that have been slow to apologize _ Exxon, for
example, following the Alaskan oil spill in 1989 _ have found it
hard to recover from perceptions that they just don't care.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester's apology stopped short of admitting liability;
Coca-Cola also released a toxicology report that suggested
something else must have caused the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   That made Coke's apology a more limited serving of humble pie
than other corporate leaders have had to dish out. In Japan,
executives not only apologize publicly but also personally, to each
person harmed in incidents. American Express apologized profusely
in 1989 for a smear campaign against Edmund J. Safra, a former
executive who founded a competing bank. That apology, by James D.
Robinson III, then the company chairman, was reinforced with $4
million in contributions to charities specified by Safra. (Robinson
is now a director of Coca-Cola.)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson is considered the gold standard of crisis
management. Its chairman, James E. Burke, dealt with tampering in
its Tylenol pain-reliever capsules in 1986 by removing products
from the market permanently to prevent similar incidents in the
future _ something that has come to be seen as the ultimate
apology.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on Coke products was lifted last week for the most part,
and the company plans to spend heavily across Europe to rebuild
public confidence. On Wednesday, after Belgian authorities let the
company reopen its bottling plants and put products back on store
shelves, Ivester felt compelled to say the S-word one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let down the people of Belgium,'' he said, ``and we're
sorry for that.''  &QL;

 PULLING BUSH DOWN BY HIS COATTAILS  (The Week in Review)  By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas made a triumphant
visit to Capitol Hill last week, congressional Republicans grabbed
hold of him as if he were a life raft that could sail them all to
victory. But their clutch left some in both parties predicting that
Bush's Washington allies would only weigh down his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although he promised lawmakers that he would not ``bash members
of the Republican Congress,'' Bush, the son of the former
president, is in many ways already running against them. He decries
the partisan atmosphere in Washington that prevents the kind of
conciliation that leads to legislative compromise. He has sought to
soften the image of his party by calling himself a compassionate
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   But who has done more in recent years to make Republicans look
like hard-edged ideologues than the House Republican majority
brought to power by Newt Gingrich? From the government shutdown of
1995 to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998, House
Republicans have been locked in bitter partisan clashes with
Clinton for years.
</P>
<P>
   Even now when their goal is to make no waves and let Bush become
their leader and spokesman, Republicans in the House cannot seem to
sidestep the kinds of controversies that could give pause to the
moderates and independent voters Bush will need to appeal to if he
becomes the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Look what has taken place in the House this month alone. As the
peace settlement in Kosovo was being concluded and Clinton was
telling the nation it should be proud of driving back the forces of
Slobodan Milosevic, Republicans took to the floor to insist that
America had been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is victory?'' asked Rep. William Goodling of
Pennsylvania. ``I call it a total disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Then within weeks the House was on to its debates over cultural
issues and gun control. Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, moved
to the fore with suggestions that day care and contraception were
causing youth violence. He called for creationism to be given equal
billing with evolution in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan's jeremiad prompted George Will, a man of impeccable
conservative credentials, to ask DeLay on ABC's ``This Week With
Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts'' if he was a ``blaming America
first'' kind of Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Things are not expected to get prettier as the presidential race
moves ever nearer to the primary contests. Both political parties
expect a spectacular budget showdown over tax cuts and spending
this summer or fall, just the sort of confrontation Republicans
have shown a penchant for losing during the Clinton years.
Democrats are seeking to use Bush's many congressional endorsements
to tie him to the cuts in domestic programs that Republicans will
have to push through if they are to carry out their budget plan and
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush needs to speak out on this,'' said Roy Romer, the
general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ``He cannot
sit idly by and let his allies in Congress rip apart programs for
families, and then say on the campaign trail that `I'm not going to
leave anybody behind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Wittmann, a political analyst at the Heritage
Foundation, said Bush could also be hurt by a budget fight if his
congressional allies appear to give in to Clinton for a second year
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a potentially serious mistake to embrace a
Congress that may ultimately frustrate the desires of the grass
roots of the Republican Party,'' Wittmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insists that his ties to Congress will not be a liability.
His persistently high poll ratings indicate that Congress is far
less of a drag on him than Clinton and the Lewinsky scandal are on
the leading Democratic contender, Vice President Al Gore. ``My job
is to talk about prosperity with a purpose, which I will do,'' Bush
said. ``I think attempts to tie me to DeLay and all that stuff, I
don't think it's going to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Disillusioned voters could always elect Bush and then punish
Republicans in Congress by splitting their tickets and putting
Democrats in control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   It is also quite possible that Americans will not be as
alienated from Congress as Democrats hope. A survey conducted by Ed
Goeas, a Republican strategist, and Celinda Lake, a Democrat, found
that even though 52 percent of voters disapprove of the job
Republicans in Congress are doing, the electorate splits 39 percent
to 39 percent when voters are asked if they would prefer a Democrat
or a Republican for Congress. Twenty-two percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard to look like the embodiment of change when you
come to the Capitol and pose with the Washington establishment.
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard,
predicted that Bush could eventually pay more for consorting with
the lobbyists who packed his Washington fund-raising reception on
Wednesday than for courting Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has said in the last two weeks that he's an opponent of
the status quo,'' Kristol said. ``Then he shows up at the Hilton
with 2,000 embodiments of the status quo and Washington insiders.''

moves ever nearer to the primary contests. Both political parties
expect a spectacular budget showdown over tax cuts and spending
this summer or fall, just the sort of confrontation Republicans
have shown a penchant for losing during the Clinton years.
Democrats are seeking to use Bush's many congressional endorsements
to tie him to the cuts in domestic programs that Republicans will
have to push through if they are to carry out their budget plan and
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush needs to speak out on this,'' said Roy Romer, the
general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ``He cannot
sit idly by and let his allies in Congress rip apart programs for
families, and then say on the campaign trail that `I'm not going to
leave anybody behind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Wittmann, a political analyst at the Heritage
Foundation, said Bush could also be hurt by a budget fight if his
congressional allies appear to give in to Clinton for a second year
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a potentially serious mistake to embrace a
Congress that may ultimately frustrate the desires of the grass
roots of the Republican Party,'' Wittmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insists that his ties to Congress will not be a liability.
His persistently high poll ratings indicate that Congress is far
less of a drag on him than Clinton and the Lewinsky scandal are on
the leading Democratic contender, Vice President Al Gore. ``My job
is to talk about prosperity with a purpose, which I will do,'' Bush
said. ``I think attempts to tie me to DeLay and all that stuff, I
don't think it's going to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Disillusioned voters could always elect Bush and then punish
Republicans in Congress by splitting their tickets and putting
Democrats in control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   It is also quite possible that Americans will not be as
alienated from Congress as Democrats hope. A survey conducted by Ed
Goeas, a Republican strategist, and Celinda Lake, a Democrat, found
that even though 52 percent of voters disapprove of the job
Republicans in Congress are doing, the electorate splits 39 percent
to 39 percent when voters are asked if they would prefer a Democrat
or a Republican for Congress. Twenty-two percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard to look like the embodiment of change when you
come to the Capitol and pose with the Washington establishment.
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard,
predicted that Bush could eventually pay more for consorting with
the lobbyists who packed his Washington fund-raising reception on
Wednesday than for courting Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has said in the last two weeks that he's an opponent of
the status quo,'' Kristol said. ``Then he shows up at the Hilton
with 2,000 embodiments of the status quo and Washington insiders.''

AS STATE LAWMAKERS' POWER INCREASES, SO DOES GRIDLOCK

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With its preference for crossfire over consensus,
harangues over handshakes, the New York Legislature has long
engaged in an us-vs.-them tribalism that influences everything _
from the favors it bestows on constituents to the allocation of
water coolers in the Statehouse. Now, though, the coarse political
customs here have become so entrenched that state leaders have been
all but unable to perform their most fundamental duties.
</P>
<P>
   The state budget is three months late, preventing school systems
and nonprofit groups from doing modest planning. Significant
health-care proposals lie virtually untouched and the Legislature
cannot even agree on minor criminal justice initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the current vitriol, Albany used to be considered
something of a parliamentary freak show. But gridlock fueled by New
York-style partisan passions is spreading to state capitals around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   This trend is emerging in part because Washington has been
transferring power to the states on matters like welfare, providing
lawmakers with more to wrangle over and drawing more interest
groups into the fray. State authority was further strengthened by
last week's Supreme Court decisions that placed curbs on Congress'
ability to make federal law binding on the states.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the transformation of federal-state relations,
the other root of the partisanship has been growing political
competition. After decades in which control of most state
legislatures was solidly in the hands of one party or the other,
perpetual losers have turned the tables. In the once-Democratic
South, Republicans have made steady inroads. In the Midwest, the
balance in many legislatures is so precarious it has repeatedly
shifted in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this doesn't breed an environment of mutual
respect, cooperation and good feeling,'' said Chuck Chvala, a
Democrat who is now majority leader of the Wisconsin Senate for the
second time in the 1990s, after serving as minority leader twice.
Just last week, a Republican state senator, Bob Welch, demanded an
ethics investigation of Chvala, contending that he had committed
the sin of working on the budget in private.
</P>
<P>
   Term limits, which affect elected officials in almost 20 states,
have also had an impact, casting out entrenched lawmakers and
making its easier for opposition parties to win seats. The
newcomers, knowing their stay is limited, have less incentive to
try to push them out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, these tensions are likely to escalate because
parties in control after the next election will be able to draw
district lines based on the 2000 census, helping them _ through the
wonders of gerrymandering _ to stay on top.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, partisanship is not necessarily bad, especially if it
shakes up legislatures where one-party supremacy led to stagnation.
Not every statehouse has turned unruly. Today's good fiscal times
can go a long way toward salving disputes. It may be that
constituents are content to let lawmakers bicker the months away.
Still, the new tone is evident in many capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fights over seats, another factor has been the
evolving character of lawmaking. Once strictly a part-time vocation
_ practically a hobby _ the post of legislator has become very
time-consuming in many states, with legislatures taking on some of
the trappings, and political sensibilities, of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, legislative leaders are setting up centralized
committees to collect political contributions, largely from donors
with business before their legislatures. Through these committees,
the leaders can maintain discipline among the rank and file, which
is more beholden to them for campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible symbol of this new era may have been the
squabbling earlier this year in the Alabama Legislature between
newly emboldened Republicans and old-guard Democrats. The
lieutenant governor, the first Republican to win the position in
this century, hunkered down in the Senate chamber for a
round-the-clock session, refusing to take a bathroom break lest the
Democratic senators trump him in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have also seen more contentiousness. In North
Carolina and Indiana, control over the lower house has ricocheted
from one party to the other and back again, with the newly ousted
minority stewing in exile and plotting its return to power.
California has often witnessed turmoil this decade _ including
tardy budgets a la Albany _ in part because of term limits.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, in roughly 65 percent of the states either
major party has a reasonable chance of seizing control, an increase
from less than 50 percent two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you had a 90-to-10 percentage split, it was almost a
nonpartisan state; partisanship didn't mean much to anybody,'' said
Malcolm Jewell, an emeritus professor of political science at the
University of Kentucky. ``There wasn't any point in trying to stick
together. You didn't need party cohesion.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, New York is not one of the places where
legislative races are more competitive. Partisanship in Albany
stems largely from the rivalry between the two houses, and not the
feuding inside. There are no term limits, and the majorities _
Republicans in the Senate, Democrats in the Assembly _ have used
the rules to cement absolute dominance.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, the skirmishes around the nation leave the
impression that there has been a steady Albany-ization of state
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are much more partisan, looking toward the next
election,'' said Paul Mannweiler, a Republican who is minority
leader in the Indiana House but who has also been speaker. ``We are
in the minority now, but we have to get back to the majority. To do
that, you have to draw some partisan differences.''

EUROPE LOSES ITS APPETITE FOR HIGH-TECH FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PARIS _ The beating of a butterfly's wings in one hemisphere, it
turns out, really can cause a hurricane in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, researchers at Cornell published findings that
genetically altered corn, designed to produce pollen toxic to
pests, could also kill caterpillars of the monarch butterflies,
whose principal breeding range is the U.S. corn belt.
</P>
<P>
   Americans heard this news with a momentary shrug of disapproval.
But in the European Union, environmental officials are taking the
news much more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from consumers fed up with what British
newspapers call ``Frankenstein food,'' the union was tightening
regulations that have already limited the number of genetically
modified crops that can be marketed to 18. Now the
butterfly-killing corn seems likely to be barred under a tacit
moratorium on permitting any new items until the Europeans can
agree on new rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where three-quarters of all genetically
modified crops are grown, consumers seem hardly to care whether
chemists have tinkered with the genes as long as the stuff looks
and tastes normal. In Europe, demonstrators in southern France this
month uprooted and burned part of a field of experimental modified
rapeseed.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Britain, which grows and exports such things, Sainsbury
supermarkets have had to pull everything made from genetically
modified organisms off the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   So why are the Europeans so much more nervous than Americans?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is agricultural protectionism. Europe resents
the fact that many of the patents on genetically modified crops
with bred-in high yields and resistance to parasites are held by
American companies like Monsanto, DuPont and Dow.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a different attitude toward food in some places.
The French don't like what they call ``industrial'' tomatoes,
fruits and vegetables because they think these products just don't
taste very good.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason may be that Europeans are panicked these
days about food safety. Americans might be nervous too, if the Food
and Drug Administration had as dismal a record as Europe's
bureaucracies have racked up recently in insuring the safety of
food that comes to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly had Europeans recovered from fears that mad cow disease
could infect people who ate infected beef when a new scandal in
Belgium last month caused fear that chicken, eggs, beef, pork, veal
and maybe even milk and cheese could be contaminated with
cancer-causing dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of both disasters was the same cause _ adulterated
animal feed. Five generations ago, most Europeans probably couldn't
afford to eat meat except for Sunday dinner. But things have
changed, and in the rush to produce more beef cheaply for modern
consumers, feed producers in Britain and elsewhere in the 1980s
took to enriching feed grain with ground-up offal and parts of
slaughtered sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Bossies were never meant to be carnivores, and after cattle
ingested bits of sheep brain that had been infected with a
nerve-degenerative disorder called scrapies, some cows in Britain
were seen staggering around, eventually succumbing to a
scrapieslike disease.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, fear spread that if cattle could get it from eating
sheep, people could get it from eating beef.
</P>
<P>
   Britain banned the adulterated feed in 1990, but pooh-poohed the
fears until 1996, when the authorities finally conceded that they
could not rule out a link between the disease showing up in cattle
and a horrifyingly similar malady that destroys the human brain,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
   British beef was banned from continental markets for most of a
decade, and sales of beef produced in most other European countries
suffered as well.
</P>
<P>
   Did European food-safety regulation improve with this
experience?
</P>
<P>
   Not in Belgium, where last March veterinarians discovered that
chickens were getting sick and not laying eggs after eating feed
that had been enriched, this time with reprocessed animal fat. The
problem was that used motor oil had been dumped into the fat vats,
contaminating the whole food chain with dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Belgians until the end of May, though, to notify
consumers (or the authorities in neighboring countries) that there
was a problem with almost everything except vegetables. With little
they could trust to feed themselves with, Belgians threw out their
government in elections on June 13, just after another scare broke
_ this time over Coca-Cola; about 250 Belgian schoolchildren and
other people reported symptoms of nausea, intestinal pain and
headaches after drinking it.
</P>
<P>
   The company didn't admit liability but blamed shipping pallets
that had been treated, against European food regulations, with
toxic phenol or cresol.
</P>
<P>
   Not even wine seems safe. Last week, French inspectors seized
440 pounds of dried bull's blood that had been used, illegally, to
clarify cheap Cotes-du-Rhone and Cotes-de-Provence wines.
</P>
<P>
   All of that might seem to have little to do with genetic
engineering of vegetables, but there is a psychological connection;
a lack of confidence that the officials who are supposed to protect
Europeans from unseen dangers will do their job well, or even admit
there is a threat. In such an atmosphere, distrust of anything new
flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans also have one more reason to be wary about genetic
manipulation: Hitler had an interest in it. Nazi abuse of science
has left scars in the popular psyche that make European
environmentalist parties, especially in Germany, particularly
skeptical about the wisdom of toying with genes _ even in plants.

   ROME _ A decade after the old Yugoslavia began to break up,
President Clinton paid a visit to the thriving, peaceful land of
Slovenia a week ago, followed quickly by a visit to bedraggled
Albanian refugees waiting to return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast could not have been greater, and the quick
succession of Balkan photo-ops hinted at how differently the
various parts of what once was Yugoslavia are faring these days.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson was hard to miss: The earlier these countries broke
off from Belgrade _ and the weaker the Serb claim to their land _
the better they are doing now.
</P>
<P>
   But comparisons among the republics that have broken away from
the Serb-dominated country that is still called Yugoslavia are more
complicated than that, because each of these lands had a different
role to play in the old Yugoslavia, and that role helped determine
its fate in the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   A quick glance at the four newly independent lands _ Slovenia,
Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia _ illustrates how
differently they are faring now.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia, the old Yugoslavia's economic powerhouse, has been the
biggest winner.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did it break away first, with a war that was over in a
few days in 1991, but it always did have the best economic chance
to survive on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia had strong, historic ties to its neighbors Italy and
Austria, and those ties lent realism to its ambitions to be part of
the new Europe. Today, they help account for the stability that
prompted Clinton to hold it aloft as a model for the rest of the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenians' purchasing power, at two-thirds the Western European
average, is close to that of Greeks, perhaps even equal.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia also benefited from ethnic homogeneity; only a
smattering of Serbs and Croats live there alongside Slovenes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it qualified for consideration for future membership
in both the European Union and the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia was next to break away from Belgrade, in bitter fighting
in 1991 and 1992 that was followed by an ethnic cleansing campaign
in 1995 that evicted Serbs from Croatia and western Bosnia. The
Croats were the Serbs' major rivals in the old Yugoslavia, and
sizable numbers of Serbs lived within Croatia, so its secession was
traumatic.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's leader, Franjo Tudjman, is a communist turned
nationalist, much like Milosevic; he too has cemented power under a
form of government that a British expert on the region, Timothy
Garton Ash, calls demokratura _ virtual dictatorship based on free
but not always fair elections and an authoritarian grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   In Serb-led Yugoslavia, the results of this style of rule are by
now well known. Milosevic has kept power during nearly a decade of
conflicts and international embargo, but the Serbian economy is in
ruins.
</P>
<P>
   In Croatia the picture is more mixed. Tudjman's brand of
nationalism has yielded some prosperity, but Croatians are
polarized politically, with Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union
pitted against a harassed and divided opposition. Corruption is
widespread; heeding Western advice, Tudjman has sold off
nationalized industries, but the businesses have often gone to his
cronies. The banking system has been milked to fill his party's
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the United States has supported the government in
Zagreb, and America is Croatia's biggest source of foreign
investment. Big construction contracts have gone to Enron Corp. and
Bechtel Corp. Recently the United States lifted an embargo on arms
sales and it has discussed drawing Zagreb closer to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But the same human-rights advocates who have denounced Serb
atrocities against Bosnia's Muslims and Kosovo's Albanians are very
critical of Tudjman as well. His government's troops have been
accused of war crimes in the ethnic cleansing of Serbs in 1995, and
of not meeting all the commitments they made in signing the 1995
Dayton accords to pacify Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo has had a mixed effect. Croatian tourist
destinations are deserted but the ports have flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman was recently treated for cancer. Later this year Croatia
will hold elections, and the opposition is hoping to oust him. But
their divisions considerably reduce the chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia was hurt even more grievously in the breakup of
Yugoslavia, and the Kosovo war only complicates the picture.
Bosnian independence came at the price of a three-year war
characterized by Serb campaigns of ethnic cleansing, the siege of
Sarajevo and the division of the land, under NATO-led peacekeeping,
into a Serb-led republic and a Muslim-Croat federation. The war's
ferocity reflected the extent to which Croats, Serbs and Muslims
were intermixed.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, rampant inflation in what is left of Yugoslavia has
strengthened the marka, the new Bosnian currency, while it has
weakened the role of the Yugoslav currency, the dinar, in the
Bosnian Serb republic. But that region once did 70 percent of its
trade, mainly oil products and timber, with Yugoslavia, and in the
wake of the Kosovo war that business has withered.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a blow to Bosnia as a whole, whose economy now
relies almost entirely on international reconstruction money _ $5.1
billion over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, a fragile political balance created by the Dayton
accords and enforced by NATO soldiers has held. This month, when a
Bosnian Croat, Ante Jelavic, assumed Bosnia's rotating presidency,
he pledged to accelerate Bosnian integration into the West. But
roughly 800,000 Bosnians remain displaced and only a few thousand
have returned to prewar homes in areas now controlled by other
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, the southernmost of these lands, is the poorest; it
obtained independence in 1992 without a fight (it has deep ethnic
divisions but an insignificant Serb minority), and is often
portrayed as a contrast to its explosive neighbor, Kosovo. But
Macedonia also seems to be proving that a tolerant and enlightened
political leadership is no guarantee of economic progress.
</P>
<P>
   Last year elections produced a coalition government that united
the leaders of Macedonia's most polarized ethnic groups _ the
Macedonian Slavs (the majority) and the Albanians (about a quarter
of the population). The government inherited a stable but
dirt-poor, economy, with unemployment about 35 percent. Now the
Kosovo war has had a devastating effect. More than 250,000 Kosovar
Albanians poured in, taxing the economy and jeopardizing the ethnic
balance; lost trade and deals cost an estimated $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrived last week, the Kosovar Albanians he visited
were still waiting in Macedonia to go home, even as NATO used the
country as a route north for its peacekeepers. To the Macedonians
he pledged Western help to keep the country on the ``path of
prosperity, and even stronger democracy and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonians, and others in the region, will be watching to see
how soon it arrives.

   House Bill Makes It Harder to Seize Property
</P>
<P>
   A surprising coalition of liberals and conservatives on the
House Judiciary Committee persuaded the House to pass a bill that
would sharply limit the power of the police and prosecutors to
confiscate property in narcotics and other criminal cases. The
measure marked the first time in nearly 30 years that Congress had
taken away from law enforcement some of the vast powers it approved
at the height of the war on drugs.
</P>

   The 375-48 House vote is more than enough to overcome opposition
from the White House.

   Loan to China Approved
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a no-brainer for the World Bank: Give China a
loan to move 58,000 poor farmers _ volunteers only, please _ to
more fertile land in western China. But there was a hitch: The land
was partly settled by Tibetans. Congress and the administration
protested that the project would help China dilute the presence of
ethnic Tibetans in the area.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a remarkable fight between Washington and the
bank, which ultimately decided to overrule its biggest shareholder
and go ahead with the loan _ but only after another review to make
sure the resettlement violates none of its own rules.

   Senate Kills Steel Bill
</P>
<P>
   No one has Washington wired like the steel lobby. At least,
that's what everyone thought. For a year Big Steel has been
complaining about big imports. It got the Clinton administration to
crack down on Japanese, Korean, Russian and Brazilian steel
``dumped'' in the United States at super-cheap prices.
</P>
<P>
   But it wanted more: a law setting quotas on the amount of
imported foreign steel. The House went along, but now the Senate,
in a surprise vote, said this was no time to turn to protectionism.

   AMA to Form Union
</P>
<P>
   Long before HMOs came along, Americans envied doctors for their
incomes and independence. But in this age of managed care, doctors
have started to sound like blue-collar workers, complaining about
shrinking incomes and being pushed around. As a result, the
American Medical Association has approved a startling resolution to
form a union to help the many doctors who believe banding together
is the only way to stand up to managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the AMA, which represents 34 percent of the
nation's doctors, insist that the union's goal will be to improve
patient care, but many health-care experts say its main goal will
be identical with that of any other union: to fatten its members'
paychecks.

   Senate Backs U.N. Payment
</P>
<P>
   The United States took a big step toward paying nearly $1
billion in back dues to the United Nations. The Senate voted 98-1
to pay the arrears in exchange for a reduction in the overall U.S.
contribution to the United Nations from 25 percent to 20 percent of
its budget.
</P>
<P>
   There is still far to go before the dues are actually paid,
however. The bill now goes to the House, where Republicans are
threatening to add anti-abortion provisions, as they have in the
past. That could lead to a presidential veto.

for publishing a memoir about the author.
</P>
<P>
   Then Peter Norton, a software entrepreneur, bought the letters
for $156,500 and said he would return them to Salinger. In a
forgiving gesture, Norton said Ms. Maynard had every right to sell
the letters to support her children.

says she intends to write her own memoir about her father.

selected Sir Simon Rattle, who recently stepped down from the City
of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in Britain, to wield its baton
after Claudio Abbado retires in 2002.

the Vienna State Opera. A day later, the Berlin Philharmonic
selected Sir Simon Rattle, who recently stepped down from the City
of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in Britain, to wield its baton
after Claudio Abbado retires in 2002.

   That fills two top jobs, but orchestras in New York,
Philadelphia, Atlanta and Indianapolis, among other cities, are
still shopping for new music directors.

   NEW YORK _ It was to be one of those lavish celebrations that
the uninvited are meant to envy: a party at the city-owned Brooklyn
Navy Yard to launch the debut issue of a slick magazine called
Talk. There would be celebrities, fireworks and the Manhattan
skyline to serve as a majestic backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   And the hosts had the requisite aura of clout. Tina Brown, the
former editor of The New Yorker, is now the editor of Talk. And
Harvey Weinstein is co-chairman of Miramax Films, one of the
magazine's backers, and a partner with the city in plans to turn
the Navy Yard into a movie studio.
</P>
<P>
   But mere speculation that the visage of Hillary Rodham Clinton
might grace the magazine's first cover was reason enough for Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, her likely opponent if she runs for the Senate,
to deny the use of the Navy Yard for the party. The action
attracted a lot of publicity _ the free kind for the magazine, the
bad kind for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican mayor's aides explained that they were already
harboring logistical concerns about the party when they saw an item
in The New York Post that Talk's first issue would feature the
first lady. It also did not go unnoticed that Mrs. Clinton is
friendly with Weinstein, a generous contributor to the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that item, a Navy Yard official explained, ``We felt
that the party was beginning to take on a political cast,'' which
``could easily violate our policy against hosting political
events.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's executives reveled in the buzz that the
disinvitation attracted; Ms. Brown even joked that she might ask
the mayor whether his official residence, Gracie Mansion, was
available for the event.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor wasn't in a partying mood. When questions about
the matter persisted at a news conference a day later, he abruptly
ended the session and left the room.

   What Do Women Want?
</P>
<P>
   Seldom does one piece of research touch on so many burning
issues, starting with: How come women think a waif like Leonardo di
Caprio is the cutest ever one week, and then line up for
craggy-faced Sean Connery the next?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may have to do with a woman's menstrual cycle,
according to a study by British and Japanese psychologists that
found that the appeal of rugged male looks rises with a woman's
chances of conception.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the journal Nature, was prompted by the
mystery of why courtship is more confusing for human guys than
animal guys, for whom having the most exaggerated set of masculine
traits _ the brightest plumage or longest tusks _ has always been a
sure way to get a date. Since the ability to grow such equivalents
of a jutting chin indicate robust health, animal mating appears to
be driven by a search for the best genes.
</P>
<P>
   But women aren't like that, at least according to what they had
told earlier researchers: When given a choice among male faces,
they would generally opt for one with smoother, softer _ more
feminine _ features. To reconcile this gap, the researchers turned
to the menstrual cycle, after pondering one other recently
established fact: that women's general distaste for men's smell
abates around the time of ovulation, when fertility is at a peak.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, in fact, found only two factors that dampened the
hunk-to-sweetie-pie swing. Women taking birth-control pills picked
a Mr. Right and stuck to him, and so did women asked to pick a face
for a long-term relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The study concedes that this adds up to a controversial view, in
evolutionary terms, of a women's ideal mating strategy: Go ahead,
marry Mr. Nice-and-Boring, but don't throw away that bad boy's
number.

DOING PUBLIC PENANCE FOR MAKING GERMS INTO BULLETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (The Week in Review) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   His English halting, his hand never far from a cigarette, Ken
Alibek sat in his office near Washington on a gray day about a year
ago and said he would readily give up his life if that were what it
would take.
</P>
<P>
   He told of a death threat. A serious one. But his demeanor in
recounting the incident was calm, even peaceful. In hours of
interviewing and talk, and in subsequent conversations over the
course of a year, he seemed to be a warrior with an eye not so much
on victory as on redemption, a man trying to make amends for a dark
past.
</P>
<P>
   Alibek was a military physician in the Soviet Union. Like every
doctor, he took an oath to preserve life and guard against medical
abuse. But after doing so, he devoted himself for 17 years not to
healing but to the science of germ warfare _ devising new ways of
harnessing deadly microbes to maim and kill people. Among his
killers were smallpox, anthrax, tularemia and plague.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a theory. Mishaps of infection killed peers and
once struck him with a raging fever. In time, Alibek was promoted
to the top of the Soviet Union's sprawling effort to advance germ
warfare, which employed more than 60,000 experts even as Moscow
publicly denounced biological weapons as immoral and repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Alibek was born a Kazakh and sprang from the
region's ancient nobility _ the Asiatic hordes that gave Moscow the
jitters _ his lineage was impeccable from a socialist perspective.
His grandfather was a hero of the communist revolution in
Kazakhstan and was the republic's first people's commissar of
internal affairs, responsible for the police and security there in
the 1920s and 1930s. His father was decorated for bravery in World
War II and served as a police official in Alma-Ata, the old name of
the Kazakh capital now known as Almaty.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade ago, that whole world began changing. Soon after
the Soviet Union fell apart in late 1991, Alibek quit his
germ-warfare post and cut his ties with the Russian military,
hoping to free himself from labors he had begun to despise. Still
in Moscow, he worked for a Kazakh bank.
</P>
<P>
   But in June 1992, he recounts in his new book, ``Biohazard''
(Random House), he returned home to a newly independent Kazakhstan,
where high officials asked him to head a military program they said
they were establishing in germ warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Appalled, he declined the offer, his hands trembling in anger
and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, he defected to the United States, ready to blow the
whistle on Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   After a year or so of secret debriefings, intelligence officials
offered him a new identity. Shorn of his past, he could become a
new person, with a new life and a new job.
</P>
<P>
   He declined. Instead, Kanatjan Kalibekov changed his name to
make it sound more American, becoming Ken Alibek. Eventually, he
decided to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government officials asked me not to,'' Alibek said in his
office. ``For five years, they tried to keep me silent.''
</P>
<P>
   American experts feared for his life, suspecting that former
Soviet bosses and associates might seek revenge, he recalled. But
Alibek decided to run the risk. ``You know,'' he said, ``if a
solution of this problem would cost just my life, that's a pretty
fair cost.'' After a visitor expressed surprise at his statement,
he said it again, deadpan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion,'' he continued, drawing near, his wide face
hinting at his Central Asian roots, ``we're very close to serious
changes. The problem is biological terrorism. If we don't start
discussing this situation openly _ if we don't start developing
serious protection in many areas, using political approaches,
medical approaches, scientific approaches _ we'll face serious
problems in the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Alibek went public with that message, appearing in
television and newspaper interviews. His book details the germ
weapons that he says Moscow made, including warheads for long-range
missiles. He not only suggests that germs were sold abroad as the
Soviet state collapsed and Russian scientists sought new ways to
support themselves, but he also names the names of many high
officials, rogue scientists and former colleagues, potentially a
dangerous thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of his motives is remorse. ``Of course I feel
guilty,'' Alibek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived with this situation for years, and with the knowledge
of the situation,'' he continued. But after defecting to the United
States and meditating on the work of Russia's germ warriors, he
said, ``Even for me it was scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an enormous, huge, sophisticated program,'' he said.
``A lot of people were involved, a lot of resources. And all people
who were in charge were very important, had a lot of privileges
like personal cars, special telephone lines, special medical
treatments _ you know, a lot of such things. And of course, that's
why not a lot of people want this program to be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   He suspects that Russia still harbors a clandestine program for
germ warfare and said he hopes his revelations will help force
Moscow to end its deceptions and redeem itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is angry,'' he said. ``It has denied what I am saying.
But I will continue my disclosures. My final, ultimate objective is
to have Russia as a partner _ but after, just after, we know
everything that is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightmares used to haunt him, he said. Wrapped in a
claustrophobic anti-germ suit, he would be trapped in a production
maze, caught amid fermenters brewing swarms of deadly microbes. But
such dreams, he said, are rare now that he has left that world and
spoken out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's some kind of relief,'' he said.

<P>
   As a boy growing up in Kazakhstan, Alibek was fascinated by the
image of medics saving lives amid battlefield smoke. ``It struck me
that military physicians were soldiers after their own fashion,
waging a private war,'' he writes in his book.
</P>
<P>
   In medical school, he planned on being a psychiatrist, on
banishing demons. But instead he was lured into the secretive world
of germ weapons, drawn, he said, by careerism, patriotism and the
firm belief that America, too, was lying about its renunciation of
such deadly arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral argument,'' he said in his book, ``for using any
available weapon against an enemy threatening us with certain
annihilation seemed to me irrefutable.''
</P>
<P>
   Alibek has his critics, ranging from nationalist Russians who
consider him disloyal, to Americans who blame him for working with
biological weapons in the first place. These critics call him an
opportunist and worse. Having jumped off the sinking Soviet ship,
they charge, he is now trying to soothe a guilty conscience, sell
books and make money, just another former thug trying to cash in.
</P>
<P>
   Alibek dismissed them. ``The book is done,'' he said. ``People
should make their own conclusion about what was going on'' in
Moscow's secret biological maze, and about the implications of the
Soviet collapse. ``It doesn't matter what they think about me.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he recently received a flier from a Moscow-based
company, Bioeffekt Ltd., that offered, by mail, various strains of
tularemia, a highly infectious germ that causes chills, fever and
can kill _ a germ that was central to the Soviet arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Kislichkin, formerly a scientist at Obolensk, a top
Soviet biological warfare center, was listed in the flier as the
company's president, Alibek says in the book. Dozens of such
businesses have risen out of Soviet ashes, he added, ``contributing
to an alarming proliferation of biological weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, as well as during his interviews, he talks
repeatedly of Yury T. Kalinin, who Alibek says was his old Soviet
boss in germ warfare and remains a force in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever return to Moscow, you won't be leaving,'' Alibek
said a Russian visitor warned him, passing on a death threat.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alibek, 48, is employed at Hadron, Inc., a company in
Annandale, Va., that does consulting work for the federal
government. As in his public advocacy, he hopes to advance germ
defenses. His research centers on a way to boost the body's immune
system to heighten overall protection against deadly germs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my dream,'' he said of creating a shield against the
kinds of bullets he once made as a warrior.

THE COURTS VS. SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY

<P>
   During years of fighting liability suits, makers of silicone
breast implants paid out more than $7 billion in verdicts and
settlements to women claiming injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, came a correction of sorts. An independent
scientific panel issued a report suggesting the courts had been
wrong; implants, the scientists said, didn't cause serious diseases
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing earlier panels, the Institute of Medicine of the
National Academy of Sciences said silicone implants can cause
localized problems. But the report said there was no persuasive
evidence that the implants caused the more serious ailments that
some juries had blamed on them, like lupus and rheumatoid
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   The report, far too late to retrieve the $7 billion, made the
courts look foolish, hoodwinked by scientific speculation. It
highlighted sharp differences between legal and scientific
approaches to the search for truth, and increased the growing
pressure on the legal system to move away from its tradition of
letting juries sort out conflicting claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science has become so sophisticated, and it is involved in so
many lawsuits, that the courts are having to come to terms with how
they are going to deal with it,'' said Paul R. Rice, a professor at
American University's Washington College of Law. ``And they are not
doing a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle between scientific and legal approaches centers on
differing definitions of certainty. The two systems have different
goals, which often come into conflict in courtroom battles.
</P>
<P>
   Science, which never stops searching for answers, has a high
threshold for reaching conclusions: 95 percent certainty, some
scientists say, is necessary to decide that one thing probably
caused another. But the law must stop its search at the conclusion
of each case. So juries in civil cases are told that a mere
preponderance of the evidence _ 51 percent _ is enough certainty to
render a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   While the breast implant report was regarded by many as
authoritative, the battle is far from over. Lawyers for plaintiffs
attacked the report as little more than a rehash of earlier
studies, some of which were financed by the manufacturers, and
suggested that scientific research would one day conclude that
there were serious problems with the implants.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years critics of the way the legal system uses
scientific evidence have been winning. For years, judges have been
defending themselves against accusations that they permitted ``junk
science'' guesswork to persuade juries to conclude that all sorts
of products were responsible for illnesses and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the criticism that courts were letting juries be
misled with untested scientific theories and, sometimes, mere
speculation, the Supreme Court and lower courts across the country
have begun to make new rules limiting scientific and technical
evidence that is presented to before juries. In a series of cases
beginning in 1993, the Supreme Court has said trial judges should
be more vigilant ``gate keepers,'' assuring that ``scientific
testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant but reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle over breast implants and similar cases in which the
courts appeared to have reached incorrect scientific decisions have
accelerated the trend, which has often meant judges restrict the
scientific evidence that can be presented to jurors.
</P>
<P>
   As legal cases have become increasingly technical, said Peter H.
Schuck, a Yale law professor, the different legal and scientific
approaches have clashed more openly than ever before. ``Science is
always gaining new information,'' Schuck said. ``The law is the
opposite. It has to make a decision so people can get on with their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal system long ago recognized that legal and scientific
determinations might contradict each other, he said. For decades,
for example, individual smokers have had difficulty winning damage
suits against tobacco companies despite the overwhelming scientific
consensus that tobacco is linked to disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say the inconsistencies are a small price to pay
for a legal system that does not have the luxury of waiting for
scientific certainty. ``People just have to get used to the idea
that the legal system is imperfect,'' said Saul Levmore, a
professor at the University of Chicago Law School.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics say the courts have used their lower standard
of proof to encourage big verdicts in liability cases that are
supported by little more than weak theories. ``It is bad for the
rule of law,'' said David Bernstein, a professor at George Mason
University Law School in Arlington, Va., ``because the tort system
is supposed to be based on the proposition that you only pay when
you actually cause injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to insist on more definite scientific evidence
began in the 1980s, Schuck said, when some judges grew skeptical of
some of the scientific claims in high-profile cases. Judges began
to insist that plaintiffs' lawyers present epidemiological
evidence, for example, to back up the claims of doctors and other
expert witnesses that the products at issue had caused injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Two huge cases brought such critiques from judges. They involved
the claims of Vietnam veterans who said they were harmed by the
defoliant Agent Orange, and the claims of people who believed birth
defects were caused by the morning-sickness drug Bendectin.
</P>
<P>
   Critics called the plaintiffs in those cases blackmailers who
were capitalizing on the sympathies jurors have for injured people.
Such cases began a momentum that will now be spurred further by the
report on the silicone breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice and some other legal experts say startling disclosures
about companies that are exonerated by science after paying
billions of dollars are only part of the story. ``What about all
the cases of people who are now dead,'' he asked, ``and the company
was responsible and never had to pay?''

<P>
   SPECTACLE ISLAND, Mass. _ An island just cannot get any more
down and out than Spectacle Island did.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the exact opposite of St. Tropez, or the anti-St.
Lucia. Imagine a hideous, stinking, toxin-leaking dump right in the
middle of Boston Harbor, which itself used to be compared to a
toilet, what with sewage and all. A 100-acre hellhole just three
miles out from Boston that no one was allowed to land on, and who
in the world would want to anyway?
</P>
<P>
   For some in this sorry life, though, there is redemption. For
people, for islands, even for whole harbors, given a great deal of
work and the right historical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   When a group of officials and advocates boated over to check on
Spectacle Island's progress on Friday _ and invited the first
reporter to land there since the island's transformation, they said
_ they surveyed a newly terraformed world still in the making, but
already easy to imagine as a park inviting enough to attract
tourists as planned, in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Spiraling dirt roads led up a grassy, man-molded hill that
offered a 360-degree view of the harbor, once considered the
dirtiest in the United States and now, after a court-ordered
cleanup costing billions of dollars, redeemed enough that many
parts are swimmable and dolphins deign to visit.
</P>
<P>
   To one side lay Boston's lopsided skyline _ the two great
skyscrapers and the financial district cluster of smaller ones _
and to the other, the scattering of other harbor islands long so
little used that many Bostonians do not even know they exist.
</P>
<P>
   The public pier was partly finished, the man-made beach was
already washed with seaweed and spotted with jellyfish, and here
and there, roses and daisies bloomed, kept alive in these dry weeks
by water barged over from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   It gets better. Last week the U.S. Department of Transportation
announced a $1 million grant to make Spectacle Island a futuristic
land of zero-emission power. It will be powered by solar-energy
collectors, and offer visitors rides in electric cars and on an
electric boat and electric bicycles, becoming a kind of demo for a
post-fossil-fuel world, and a model for other national parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be 200 years of trash piled here,'' said Sheila
Lynch, chairwoman of the Spectacle Island Park Advisory Committee
and director of the consortium overseeing the zero-emission grant,
as she trod a new road past saplings and rose bushes. ``To see it,
in 12 years, go from a very bad landfill to a zero-emission park is
like seeing a phoenix rising from the ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now here is the serendipitous twist that turned Spectacle
Island's tale from woe to winning: None of this could have happened
without the $12 billion highway project known hereabouts as The Big
Dig.
</P>
<P>
   That big digging involves sinking the city's Central Artery
underground, along with adding a third tunnel to Logan Airport. All
that tunneling produced a lot of dirt, much of it contaminated.
Without a place to put all that dirt, the project could not have
gone forward. Meanwhile, the dumps on Spectacle Island needed to be
capped so they would stop leaking into the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   To make a long story short _ a story of more than a decade of
legal battles, politics, obtaining of permits, public pressure and
assorted city-state-federal struggles _ Spectacle Island ended up
getting about a third of the Big Dig dirt, more than 3 million
cubic yards of it. In return, the Big Dig builders were obligated
to provide ``mitigation'' services, from containing the old waste
to building a visitors' center, trails, beach and mussel habitat
area.
</P>
<P>
   All that piled and compacted dirt made the island grow about 60
feet upward to become the tallest point in the harbor. When it is
finished, planners say, Spectacle Island, which is co-owned by the
city and the state, will become a gateway point for the new
national park consisting of the harbor's 30 islands and peninsulas,
which include colorfully named spots like Hangman Island, Bumpkin
Island, Button Island and World's End.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are afoot to develop, gingerly, several of the islands,
and to vastly increase public access to them, turning them into
what one official described as a sort of poor man's Nantucket,
where city folk could take quick public ferries out to enjoy
seaside views, wind-surfing, nature education and the like.
Currently, only about 100,000 people a year ferry out to the
islands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So change awaits several of the islands, but surely none will
embody as dramatic a turnaround, as telling a history, as
Spectacle, which was so named because its original form, two mounds
connected by a sand bar, resembled a pair of spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   Long a summer gathering point for the Massachusetts Indian tribe
for which the state is named, it was used as pastureland in
colonial times; as a quarantine hospital site in the 18th century;
then as a resort spot that, by the mid-19th century, had gained
such ill repute for its gambling and dancing that the authorities
closed it down.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston businessman then installed a horse-rendering plant on
the island, and for years it absorbed thousands of Boston's equine
corpses. For much of the 20th century it was simply a dump, and
produced so much methane that in 1960, underground fires broke out
and smoldered there for years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the Defense Department, which had owned the
strategically located islands at the mouth of the harbor, sold
them, and most became part of a state park. But there was no money
to fix Spectacle until the Big Dig came along.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though still owned by the city and state, it is effectively
the ward of the kind of complex, interlocking, impeccably inclusive
public-private partnership typical of many 1990s projects.
</P>
<P>
   On the boat to the island were federal transportation and park
officials; state environmental and park officials; New England
Aquarium, Boston Edison and University of Massachusetts project
managers; environmentalists; members of advisory committees for
Spectacle Island and for the whole island park, and others.
</P>
<P>
   It was crowded on deck. But cheery.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Spectacle Island, said Brian MacDonald of the New
England Aquarium, ``is like the greatest story you can tell about
recovery.''

YOU'RE NOT OLDER. PRODUCTS ARE BETTER. 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(DW) 
 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Age isn't the only thing creeping up on the baby-boom
generation. Consumer product design and marketing are too, like
wolves on cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' 79 million boomers, now 35 to 53 years old
and at the peak of their earning power, make an exceptionally fat
herd. They represent an enormous new market of special needs
because they are getting older and have money to burn. But tell
them that advancing age is the issue behind what they're about to
buy and enjoy and they stampede.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, industries from automobile makers to soft drink
bottlers are developing sheep's clothing: a new generation of
easier-to-use products specifically designed and marketed to a
population that refuses to acknowledge the prospect of failing
eyesight, hearing and dexterity. Boomers can believe that life
hasn't changed, but the landscape of products is shifting subtly
around them.
</P>
<P>
   From bathroom fixtures to recreational equipment, the design of
everyday objects is slyly morphing. Existing products like
household utensils are being redesigned and new products like
retirement-community vehicles are being introduced with the
intention of luring the aging consumer by creating stylish products
that quicken the pulse while cosseting the creep of infirmity. What
to do about the march of time? Give it great costumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the richest group of people who ever existed,'' said
Bruce Hannah, a professor of design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.
``And they're willing to pay for three things: ease of use, safety
and comfort. That plus the best design. Couple that with
discretionary income and you have a market.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporate challenge: selling age-related products to older
consumers without asking anyone's age. For the boomer buyer who
means to stay young into senior citizenship, it's like the reverse
of being carded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't mention the age word,'' said Linda Halfmann, an
associate product manager for bathing products at Kohler, one
company benefiting from the record amounts of money spent by
boomers on home improvement. Whirlpool baths with grip rails are
replacing standard tubs, which can't knead aching backs and weary
legs. Shower stalls now routinely include seating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the sales force they're smart showers,'' Ms. Halfmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   For industry, the stakes are high. At an automotive engineers
convention in March, Lear Corp., the world's largest independent
supplier of auto interiors, held its breath as it introduced the
TransG, a minivan refitted with aging drivers in mind. The vehicle
included larger controls, more legible instrument panels, sliding
floors for easier cargo loading and powered swiveling seats to help
passengers enter or leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``In consumer clinics, they have been asking for this type of
design, but they don't want to be told when it's there,'' Leslie
Touma, Lear's director of corporate relations, said of the
company's focus groups. ``Packaging is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Touma said response to the TransG at the convention was
positive and strong. ``The point of this vehicle is that the design
is modern, exciting, not built to accommodate older people,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of much recent product development is a movement
called universal design, which proposes products be accessible to
the widest range of people, from the very young to the very old, by
taking all their limitations or disabilities into account.
Marketers love it too and have pushed it in areas important to
boomers, like home improvement and gardening. It's a kind of
philosophical expansion of ergonomics, design values that became a
buzzword in the 1980s for products promoted as user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Good Grips, a line of 15 kitchen utensils introduced in 1990 by
Oxo International, was the first big touchdown for universal
design. Created by an entrepreneur for his arthritic wife, the
roly-poly, pudgy-handled utensils were especially popular with
boomers, who responded to both their look and ease of use. Grips
have generally become larger and rounder, in response. Later this
year Oxo, which has expanded its kitchen line to 350 items, is
introducing handyman tools like screwdrivers and car tools like ice
scrapers.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi-Cola Co. is also test-marketing a universal design _ a
pinch-waisted, two-liter plastic bottle called the Grip that
requires less hand strength.
</P>
<P>
   Universal design may be intended to improve products for
everyone, but it also effectively disguises boomers, huddled at the
center, as a marketing target. Using these designs, manufacturers
hope to accompany boomers into old age, erasing the seams between
stages of life like cream on wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are things middle-aged people just naturally want,
like sports cars. Two-seat sportsters, or so-called midlife-crisis
cars like the BMW Z3 and the new Ford Thunderbird due next year,
are popular with boomers who recall the cars they owned or coveted
as teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very hungry audience, very nostalgic for the cars of
their youth,'' said Robert Mitchell, product communications manager
at BMW. ``So we've taken their comfort into account _ those cars of
the '60s were pretty snug.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's two-seaters are built with stiffer bodies and reflexes
in mind, incorporating automatic transmissions, larger door cuts,
lower door sills, elaborate suspensions, better legroom and heated
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not designed for bugs-in-the-teeth racing
enthusiasts,'' said Gianfranco Zaccai, a designer and co-founder of
Design Continuum, an international design office.
</P>
<P>
   Recreational equipment is also catering to an aging market that
wants to play with high performance but not pay in discomfort or
danger. Bombardier's Ski-Doo 2000 Grand Touring snowmobiles are
wider, steadier and slower, seat a party of three and have heated
hand grips. The company's GTX RFI Sea-Doo personal watercraft have
a fold-down reboarding step for those who find it hard to get back
on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake to tell a client this is a product to
accommodate the frailties of age,'' said J. Walker Smith, a
managing partner with Yankelovich Partners Inc. ``It's better to
say that it's better designed for the adventure. It makes the
adventure more accessible.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Similarly, sports equipment is taking aim at customers whose
skills are rusting. Shaped skis, wide-headed tennis rackets and
large-headed golf clubs now dominate their sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling youth to an older population'' by creating
products that make it ``easier for them to perform at higher
levels,'' said Stephan Hienzsch, vice president of sales and
marketing for Volant Skis, ``though they've hit a wall in terms of
improvement and they're declining in physical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Treadmills and stair-step devices are being redesigned as
hybrids like the Precor EFX Elliptical Fitness Crosstrainer, a
no-impact machine popular in health clubs. ``Every major
manufacturer of fitness equipment today is alive and well because
of the baby-boom generation,'' said Jim Birrell, director of design
at Precor. ``Now that they're older, the vanity part is falling out
and the maintenance part is falling in.''
</P>
<P>
   Other new products address infirmities in stealthier ways. The
SoftBook, a leather-bound electronic reading device that is the
size and shape of a book, has the type of feature that could prove
irresistible to older consumers _ a stroke of the finger makes the
print larger, without the appearance of a large-print publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure the baby boomers are putting on us is to be
normal,'' said Bill Moggridge, a principal of IDEO, which designed
SoftBook. ``Now that their products are being associated with
disability, they want them to be universal, like computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier's Neighborhood Vehicle, a low-speed electric car
developed for retirement communities, hopes to meet the market of
aging boomers head-on. ``Our aim was to provide a hybrid between a
car and a golf cart to accommodate people who are thinking to
retire to gated communities,'' said Denys Lapointe, vice president
of design for Bombardier Recreational Products. ``There is a
resistance to retirement tools. We styled the NV to be more upbeat
than a golf cart. The comparison is to a true car. It goes a little
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   At a top speed of 25 miles per hour, the end of the road is
going to be no big threat.

YOU'RE NOT OLDER. PRODUCTS ARE BETTER. 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(DW) 
 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Age isn't the only thing creeping up on the baby-boom
generation. Consumer product design and marketing are too, like
wolves on cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' 79 million boomers, now 35 to 53 years old
and at the peak of their earning power, make an exceptionally fat
herd. They represent an enormous new market of special needs
because they are getting older and have money to burn. But tell
them that advancing age is the issue behind what they're about to
buy and enjoy and they stampede.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, industries from automobile makers to soft drink
bottlers are developing sheep's clothing: a new generation of
easier-to-use products specifically designed and marketed to a
population that refuses to acknowledge the prospect of failing
eyesight, hearing and dexterity. Boomers can believe that life
hasn't changed, but the landscape of products is shifting subtly
around them.
</P>
<P>
   From bathroom fixtures to recreational equipment, the design of
everyday objects is slyly morphing. Existing products like
household utensils are being redesigned and new products like
retirement-community vehicles are being introduced with the
intention of luring the aging consumer by creating stylish products
that quicken the pulse while cosseting the creep of infirmity. What
to do about the march of time? Give it great costumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the richest group of people who ever existed,'' said
Bruce Hannah, a professor of design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.
``And they're willing to pay for three things: ease of use, safety
and comfort. That plus the best design. Couple that with
discretionary income and you have a market.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporate challenge: selling age-related products to older
consumers without asking anyone's age. For the boomer buyer who
means to stay young into senior citizenship, it's like the reverse
of being carded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't mention the age word,'' said Linda Halfmann, an
associate product manager for bathing products at Kohler, one
company benefiting from the record amounts of money spent by
boomers on home improvement. Whirlpool baths with grip rails are
replacing standard tubs, which can't knead aching backs and weary
legs. Shower stalls now routinely include seating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the sales force they're smart showers,'' Ms. Halfmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   For industry, the stakes are high. At an automotive engineers
convention in March, Lear Corp., the world's largest independent
supplier of auto interiors, held its breath as it introduced the
TransG, a minivan refitted with aging drivers in mind. The vehicle
included larger controls, more legible instrument panels, sliding
floors for easier cargo loading and powered swiveling seats to help
passengers enter or leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``In consumer clinics, they have been asking for this type of
design, but they don't want to be told when it's there,'' Leslie
Touma, Lear's director of corporate relations, said of the
company's focus groups. ``Packaging is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Touma said response to the TransG at the convention was
positive and strong. ``The point of this vehicle is that the design
is modern, exciting, not built to accommodate older people,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of much recent product development is a movement
called universal design, which proposes products be accessible to
the widest range of people, from the very young to the very old, by
taking all their limitations or disabilities into account.
Marketers love it too and have pushed it in areas important to
boomers, like home improvement and gardening. It's a kind of
philosophical expansion of ergonomics, design values that became a
buzzword in the 1980s for products promoted as user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Good Grips, a line of 15 kitchen utensils introduced in 1990 by
Oxo International, was the first big touchdown for universal
design. Created by an entrepreneur for his arthritic wife, the
roly-poly, pudgy-handled utensils were especially popular with
boomers, who responded to both their look and ease of use. Grips
have generally become larger and rounder, in response. Later this
year Oxo, which has expanded its kitchen line to 350 items, is
introducing handyman tools like screwdrivers and car tools like ice
scrapers.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi-Cola Co. is also test-marketing a universal design _ a
pinch-waisted, two-liter plastic bottle called the Grip that
requires less hand strength.
</P>
<P>
   Universal design may be intended to improve products for
everyone, but it also effectively disguises boomers, huddled at the
center, as a marketing target. Using these designs, manufacturers
hope to accompany boomers into old age, erasing the seams between
stages of life like cream on wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are things middle-aged people just naturally want,
like sports cars. Two-seat sportsters, or so-called midlife-crisis
cars like the BMW Z3 and the new Ford Thunderbird due next year,
are popular with boomers who recall the cars they owned or coveted
as teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very hungry audience, very nostalgic for the cars of
their youth,'' said Robert Mitchell, product communications manager
at BMW. ``So we've taken their comfort into account _ those cars of
the '60s were pretty snug.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's two-seaters are built with stiffer bodies and reflexes
in mind, incorporating automatic transmissions, larger door cuts,
lower door sills, elaborate suspensions, better legroom and heated
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not designed for bugs-in-the-teeth racing
enthusiasts,'' said Gianfranco Zaccai, a designer and co-founder of
Design Continuum, an international design office.
</P>
<P>
   Recreational equipment is also catering to an aging market that
wants to play with high performance but not pay in discomfort or
danger. Bombardier's Ski-Doo 2000 Grand Touring snowmobiles are
wider, steadier and slower, seat a party of three and have heated
hand grips. The company's GTX RFI Sea-Doo personal watercraft have
a fold-down reboarding step for those who find it hard to get back
on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake to tell a client this is a product to
accommodate the frailties of age,'' said J. Walker Smith, a
managing partner with Yankelovich Partners Inc. ``It's better to
say that it's better designed for the adventure. It makes the
adventure more accessible.''

HIGH-TECH DENTAL GIZMOS REDUCE PAIN
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of a dentist at work 
 By MARTHA NOLAN MCKENZIE 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget Laurence Olivier wielding a dental drill as an instrument
of torture in '' Marathon Man.'' Say goodbye to Steve Martin's
portrayal of the leather-clad, sadistic practitioner in ''Little
Shop of Horrors.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's dentist could be cast as a cross between the gentle
Marcus Welby and the high-tech Dr. McCoy. An array of new tools,
including lasers, intraoral cameras and digital X-rays, is taking
the fear and pain out of a visit to the dentist's chair for many
patients.
</P>
<P>
   '' I think this is a wonderful time to be a dentist, and each
day it becomes more wonderful to be a patient,'' said Dr. Stewart
Rosenberg, a dentist in Laurel, Md., who frequently lectures on the
new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful, that is, if your dentist happens to have the new
gizmos and gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   While nearly half of all dentists have an intraoral camera,
fewer than one in five are equipped with an air abrasion system _
often used instead of a laser to remove cavities _ and only about 4
percent have a dental laser or a digital X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cost is the primary impediment for dentists. A
dental laser can set an office back anywhere from $10,000 to
$45,000, and a machine that can make crowns and other ceramic
restorations on the spot sells for about $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   While supporters claim the devices pay for themselves by
allowing dentists to get patients in and out of the dental chair
with record speed, some of the extra cost is inevitably passed on
to patients.
</P>
<P>
   And not all dentists agree that the extra expense brings
improved care.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta dentist Dr. Ronald Feinman admits some of the new
advances are more ''hype-tech'' than high-tech, particularly dental
lasers. Lasers have been used on soft tissue, such as gums, for
over a decade, but they were approved for use on hard tissue by the
Food and Drug Administration just last year.
</P>
<P>
   '' Lasers have really been hyped,'' said Feinman.'' Everyone has
made a huge deal out of their ability to cut teeth, but we already
have enough equipment to cut teeth _ equipment that is just as good
but a lot less expensive than lasers.''
</P>
<P>
   And the new devices and techniques have not been around long
enough to convince everyone that they are completely safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever there is a change in any field and different methods
are used, we come to discover there are some adverse reactions,''
said Dr. Kenneth Burrell, senior director of the council on
scientific affairs for the American Dental Association. '' And
those can only be discovered through post-marketing surveillance _
after the methods have been in use for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Cautionary tales notwithstanding, dentists are starting to
embrace the new technologies because of the improvements they offer
in two main areas _ diagnostic and cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Patients may be troubled to know that the traditional method of
detecting cavities _ taking X-rays and poking around with a sharp
probe _ is only about 25 to 30 percent accurate, according to
Rosenberg. That's a lot of missed cavities that can grow into
painful problems. Intraoral cameras and digital X-rays allow
dentists to catch cavities much earlier and more reliably.
</P>
<P>
   The intraoral camera, which is mounted on the tip of a slender
wand, sends pictures of the teeth and gums to a computer screen
that can be viewed by the patient as well as the dentist. The
digital images of a cracked tooth or a pocket of decay can be
magnified for closer examination and maximum impact.
</P>
<P>
   Digital X-rays expose the patient to only about 10 percent of
the radiation of traditional X-rays, and no film needs to be
developed. The image is displayed instantly on the computer screen,
and it can be blown up and colorized to highlight problem areas.
Digital X-rays are also used to evaluate the bone levels in the
gums.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg uses another weapon in his arsenal to find and destroy
cavities. It's a dye that is painted on a patient's teeth. The dye
stains the decayed areas, forcing cavities, even in the very
earliest stages, out of hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the new tools can help dentists find cavities, they can
help patients deal with the aftermath. Instead of suffering under a
drill rotating at a head-jarring 400 rpm,patients may not even need
anesthesia as a dentist removes decayed tooth with air abrasion.
Like sand blasters that are used to clean buildings, air abrasion
systems shoot tiny particles onto the surface of the tooth,
removing decayed material while leaving most of the tooth structure
intact.
</P>
<P>
   '' Air abrasion prepares the tooth without any heat, vibration
or pressure,'' Rosenberg said. ''That means there are no needles or
drills for a lot of the procedures that we do.''
</P>
<P>
   And that means patients might visit their dentist more often.
''About 50 percent of the population only goes to the dentist when
they have an emergency, and the overwhelming reason is fear,''
Rosenberg said. ''One of the most exciting things about these new
procedures is that they are bringing back patients who were afraid
of going to the dentist.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanity is also bringing people back to the dentist. Everyone, it
seems, wants whiter teeth, and dentists increasingly are able to
make that wish come true. Until very recently, the best way for
someone to get a brighter smile was to have a '' tray'' made that
was molded to their teeth. Then every night for two weeks, the
patient would squeeze a dab of hydrogen peroxide bleaching gel into
the tray, press it in place against the teeth and sleep in it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the patient can get the same results _ or better _ in one
or two hours in the dentist's chair, thanks to lasers. The dentist
paints a bleaching solution on the teeth and then activates it with
a laser or other high-intensity light source. ''With the tray
system, you can achieve a four-shade improvement,'' said Dr. Don
Wilson, a dentist in Florence, Ala. ''The laser generally achieves
a seven-shade improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The laser also lightens the patient's wallet by several shades.
The at-home tray bleaching system typically costs around $500. The
price tag for laser bleaching, by contrast, can range between
$1,000 and $3,000. However, using an alternative light source can
bring down the cost considerably, since they cost less than lasers
and a hygienist can operate them. Only a doctor is allowed to use a
laser. Rosenberg, for example, charges $695 to bleach the entire
mouth with an alternative light source, while he used to charge
$3,000 for laser bleaching.
</P>
<P>
   As dentists continue to shift their focus from treatment to
prevention, cavities and gum disease may go the way of polio. And
patients may not be able to remember a time when they were afraid
to go to the dentist.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court rules.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message of a term in which the court asserted its
power over every branch and level of government, few of which
emerged unchanged from the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Most dramatically, the court reconfigured the federal-state
balance of power in three decisions that carved out a broad sphere
of immunity for the states from the reach of federal law. Those
decisions had a subtext with even more far-reaching implications,
indicating the court's unwillingness to credit Congress' own view
not only of the way legislation should be written but even of the
justification for federal legislation at all in areas where
Congress has deemed it preferable to stitch the states into a
uniform, nationwide rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the court any more solicitous of the executive branch,
rejecting the Clinton administration's plan for conducting the 2000
Census and insisting that there was no alternative to the
traditional head count for apportioning seats in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the states, the court invalidated California's
two-tiered welfare policy that disadvantaged new arrivals, a policy
the new federal welfare law had authorized. On the local level, the
justices rejected Chicago's approach to preventing gangs from
taking over neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a court that doesn't defer to government at any
level,'' Walter Dellinger, an acting solicitor general earlier in
the Clinton administration, said the other day. ``The court is
confident it can come up with the right decisions, and it believes
it is constitutionally charged with doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the court's lack of deference to its ostensibly co-equal
branches that was most notable. In fact, at a time when Congress
and the executive branch have appeared nearly paralyzed by partisan
stalemate and by their own internal weaknesses, one could almost
feel governmental power in Washington flowing in the court's
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court makes decisions,'' one federal judge, surveying the
scene from a courthouse far from Washington, observed recently,
``and a willingness to actually make decisions puts you in stark
contrast with all the people who just talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The court did not make many decisions: only 75, half the number
of cases decided each term in the mid-1980s, and the June 23 end of
the term was the earliest closing date in 30 years. But the cases
the justices did choose from among some 7,000 petitions for review
were arrayed along society's pressure points, from police authority
to questions of discrimination, citizenship and disability rights.
</P>
<P>
   The term that begins next October promises, if anything, to be
even more intense, with a resumption of the federalism debate in at
least three new cases and with religion also added to the mix in
the form of a case on aid to parochial schools. There will also be
a major test of the court's willingness to defer to the executive
branch when it decides whether the Food and Drug Administration has
authority to regulate tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   The term was a triumph for Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who
after 27 years on the court, 13 of those as chief justice, is
stamping his deeply held vision of state sovereignty on the court's
jurisprudence. As the federalism debate has waxed and waned over
the years, he has never diverted his attention from his goal of
curtailing the national government's authority over the states, and
he appears on the verge of succeeding to a degree that would have
seemed implausible only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three federalism decisions handed down on the term's
final day, the chief justice's majority opinion holding states
immune from suits for patent infringement was the most blandly
written and appeared narrowly cast.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath its mild tone, it was aggressively far-reaching. In
rejecting Congress' factual premises for having made states liable
for patent infringement in the first place, the opinion assumed for
the court a veto power beyond any it has exercised in modern times.
The court flatly declared that Congress lacked a sufficient reason
for enacting the patent law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is telling Congress, `We think it's not as necessary
as you apparently do, so you lose,''' Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law
School said in an interview. ``It's a complete lack of deference.''
</P>
<P>
   The only shadow over the ascendant states'-rights majority is
the narrowness of its hold on the court. The three cases were all
decided by 5 votes to 4, an alignment that now seems to admit of no
compromise or middle ground. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas joined the chief
justice's majority, while Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer made up the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, the dissenters vowed never to yield _ as Rehnquist
did himself when he was on the losing end of the same debate half a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   The alignment reflected in the federalism cases held true in
most of the court's closely fought cases _ actually, and typically,
a rather small subset of the docket. Thirty-four of the term's
cases, or 45 percent, were decided by 9-0 votes, unanimous in
outcome if not always in reasoning. Only 16 _ 21 percent _ were
decided by votes of 5-4, a group that included some important civil
rights and criminal procedure cases as well as the decision barring
statistical sampling for the Census.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 16 cases, 14 found the four most liberal justices _
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer _ arrayed against the three
most conservative, the chief justice and Scalia and Thomas. That
left the outcome up to O'Connor and Kennedy, the justices
statistically in the middle of the court (as indicated by the fact
that over the course of the term, each dissented only eight times,
the fewest of any justice, compared with 14 dissenting votes by
Thomas, to their right, and 20 dissenting votes by Stevens, to
their left.)
</P>
<P>
   In the 5-4 cases, O'Connor voted with the conservative bloc 10
times and the more liberal group four times; Kennedy's split was
12-2. The conservative group prevailed in eight of the 14 cases
that reflected a clear ideological split.
</P>
<P>
   Ideological labels on this court can be quite misleading.
Liberalism on the court is a relative concept, as demonstrated by
the court's decision during the term that the government may select
aliens for deportation on the basis of their political views.
</P>
<P>
   While the vote was 6-3, with Ginsburg, Souter and Breyer
dissenting, their dissents were aimed not at the constitutional
merits of the court's rejection of the selective-enforcement claim
but rather at the narrower issue of whether the court should have
addressed that part of the case at all after earlier indicating
that it would not do so. Immigration law is one area where the
court retains a posture of deference toward administrative
enforcement decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Justices across the spectrum remain committed to free speech
principles. A First Amendment decision striking down a federal
prohibition of broadcast advertising for casino gambling was
unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, sports equipment is taking aim at customers whose
skills are rusting. Shaped skis, wide-headed tennis rackets and
large-headed golf clubs now dominate their sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling youth to an older population'' by creating
products that make it ``easier for them to perform at higher
levels,'' said Stephan Hienzsch, vice president of sales and
marketing for Volant Skis, ``though they've hit a wall in terms of
improvement and they're declining in physical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Treadmills and stair-step devices are being redesigned as
hybrids like the Precor EFX Elliptical Fitness Crosstrainer, a
no-impact machine popular in health clubs. ``Every major
manufacturer of fitness equipment today is alive and well because
of the baby-boom generation,'' said Jim Birrell, director of design
at Precor. ``Now that they're older, the vanity part is falling out
and the maintenance part is falling in.''
</P>
<P>
   Other new products address infirmities in stealthier ways. The
SoftBook, a leather-bound electronic reading device that is the
size and shape of a book, has the type of feature that could prove
irresistible to older consumers _ a stroke of the finger makes the
print larger, without the appearance of a large-print publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure the baby boomers are putting on us is to be
normal,'' said Bill Moggridge, a principal of IDEO, which designed
SoftBook. ``Now that their products are being associated with
disability, they want them to be universal, like computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier's Neighborhood Vehicle, a low-speed electric car
developed for retirement communities, hopes to meet the market of
aging boomers head-on. ``Our aim was to provide a hybrid between a
car and a golf cart to accommodate people who are thinking to
retire to gated communities,'' said Denys Lapointe, vice president
of design for Bombardier Recreational Products. ``There is a
resistance to retirement tools. We styled the NV to be more upbeat
than a golf cart. The comparison is to a true car. It goes a little
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   At a top speed of 25 miles per hour, the end of the road is
going to be no big threat.

decisions had a subtext with even more far-reaching implications,
indicating the court's unwillingness to credit Congress' own view
not only of the way legislation should be written but even of the
justification for federal legislation at all in areas where
Congress has deemed it preferable to stitch the states into a
uniform, nationwide rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the court any more solicitous of the executive branch,
rejecting the Clinton administration's plan for conducting the 2000
Census and insisting that there was no alternative to the
traditional head count for apportioning seats in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the states, the court invalidated California's
two-tiered welfare policy that disadvantaged new arrivals, a policy
the new federal welfare law had authorized. On the local level, the
justices rejected Chicago's approach to preventing gangs from
taking over neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a court that doesn't defer to government at any
level,'' Walter Dellinger, an acting solicitor general earlier in
the Clinton administration, said the other day. ``The court is
confident it can come up with the right decisions, and it believes
it is constitutionally charged with doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the court's lack of deference to its ostensibly co-equal
branches that was most notable. In fact, at a time when Congress
and the executive branch have appeared nearly paralyzed by partisan
stalemate and by their own internal weaknesses, one could almost
feel governmental power in Washington flowing in the court's
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court makes decisions,'' one federal judge, surveying the
scene from a courthouse far from Washington, observed recently,
``and a willingness to actually make decisions puts you in stark
contrast with all the people who just talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The court did not make many decisions: only 75, half the number
of cases decided each term in the mid-1980s, and the June 23 end of
the term was the earliest closing date in 30 years. But the cases
the justices did choose from among some 7,000 petitions for review
were arrayed along society's pressure points, from police authority
to questions of discrimination, citizenship and disability rights.
</P>
<P>
   The term that begins next October promises, if anything, to be
even more intense, with a resumption of the federalism debate in at
least three new cases and with religion also added to the mix in
the form of a case on aid to parochial schools. There will also be
a major test of the court's willingness to defer to the executive
branch when it decides whether the Food and Drug Administration has
authority to regulate tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   The term was a triumph for Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who
after 27 years on the court, 13 of those as chief justice, is
stamping his deeply held vision of state sovereignty on the court's
jurisprudence. As the federalism debate has waxed and waned over
the years, he has never diverted his attention from his goal of
curtailing the national government's authority over the states, and
he appears on the verge of succeeding to a degree that would have
seemed implausible only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three federalism decisions handed down on the term's
final day, the chief justice's majority opinion holding states
immune from suits for patent infringement was the most blandly
written and appeared narrowly cast.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath its mild tone, it was aggressively far-reaching. In
rejecting Congress' factual premises for having made states liable
for patent infringement in the first place, the opinion assumed for
the court a veto power beyond any it has exercised in modern times.
The court flatly declared that Congress lacked a sufficient reason
for enacting the patent law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is telling Congress, `We think it's not as necessary
as you apparently do, so you lose,''' Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law
School said in an interview. ``It's a complete lack of deference.''
</P>
<P>
   The only shadow over the ascendant states'-rights majority is
the narrowness of its hold on the court. The three cases were all
decided by 5 votes to 4, an alignment that now seems to admit of no
compromise or middle ground. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas joined the chief
justice's majority, while Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer made up the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, the dissenters vowed never to yield _ as Rehnquist
did himself when he was on the losing end of the same debate half a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   The alignment reflected in the federalism cases held true in
most of the court's closely fought cases _ actually, and typically,
a rather small subset of the docket. Thirty-four of the term's
cases, or 45 percent, were decided by 9-0 votes, unanimous in
outcome if not always in reasoning. Only 16 _ 21 percent _ were
decided by votes of 5-4, a group that included some important civil
rights and criminal procedure cases as well as the decision barring
statistical sampling for the Census.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 16 cases, 14 found the four most liberal justices _
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer _ arrayed against the three
most conservative, the chief justice and Scalia and Thomas. That
left the outcome up to O'Connor and Kennedy, the justices
statistically in the middle of the court (as indicated by the fact
that over the course of the term, each dissented only eight times,
the fewest of any justice, compared with 14 dissenting votes by
Thomas, to their right, and 20 dissenting votes by Stevens, to
their left.)
</P>
<P>
   In the 5-4 cases, O'Connor voted with the conservative bloc 10
times and the more liberal group four times; Kennedy's split was
12-2. The conservative group prevailed in eight of the 14 cases
that reflected a clear ideological split.
</P>
<P>
   Ideological labels on this court can be quite misleading.
Liberalism on the court is a relative concept, as demonstrated by
the court's decision during the term that the government may select
aliens for deportation on the basis of their political views.
</P>
<P>
   While the vote was 6-3, with Ginsburg, Souter and Breyer
dissenting, their dissents were aimed not at the constitutional
merits of the court's rejection of the selective-enforcement claim
but rather at the narrower issue of whether the court should have
addressed that part of the case at all after earlier indicating
that it would not do so. Immigration law is one area where the
court retains a posture of deference toward administrative
enforcement decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Justices across the spectrum remain committed to free speech
principles. A First Amendment decision striking down a federal
prohibition of broadcast advertising for casino gambling was
unanimous.

</P>
<P>
   Five cases under the Americans With Disabilities Act illustrated
the court's role in construing acts of Congress, a job the justices
view as distinct from interpreting the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the disabilities law narrowly to exclude coverage of
people with correctable impairments like nearsightedness and high
blood pressure, the 7-2 majority put great weight on Congress'
calculation that 43 million Americans have disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In the majority opinion, O'Connor noted that 160 million people
have disabilities, most of them correctable, so Congress could not
have meant to include them all. Stevens and Breyer said in dissent
that Congress' figure should be taken as illustrative of the
problem the statute was supposed to address rather than a
limitation on its scope.
</P>
<P>
   There was a reminder at the end of the term that for all the
court's activism, it is no more than the passive recipient of the
problems and issues that people bring to its door.
</P>
<P>
   For years the court has been trying to decide whether Section
1981, one of the Reconstruction-era civil rights laws, prohibits
discrimination against aliens in the making of private contracts. A
case the justices granted five years ago to resolve the question
had to be dismissed when the lawsuit was settled.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, after weeks of internal debate over the
constitutional ramifications of this issue, the court selected
another case and scheduled it for argument in October. But the
parties in that case, United Brotherhood of Carpenters vs.
Anderson, then settled their dispute, and as its final act before
beginning the summer recess, the court announced that this case had
been dismissed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Following are summaries of the major cases.
</P>
<P>
   STATES GET PROTECTION FROM AN ARRAY OF LAWSUITS
</P>
<P>
   In a trio of decisions, all by the same 5-4 vote, the court
invoked a broad principle of sovereign immunity to shield states
from suit for violations of federal law. The court struck down two
federal laws, both enacted in 1992 to authorize suits against
states for violations of federal patent and trademark laws. The
justices also overturned a 35-year-old precedent under which states
that entered the commercial marketplace _ in that case, by running
a railroad _ were regarded as having waived their immunity from
suit for their activities there.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the three cases, those in the majority were Rehnquist
and O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas. The dissenters were
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the cases, Alden vs. Maine, No. 98-436, held in an
opinion by Kennedy that states could not be sued in their own
courts by state employees for violations of the Fair Labor
Standards Act. Since the justices had made it clear in a 1996
decision, Seminole Tribe vs. Florida, that such suits could not be
brought in federal court, the decision left state employees without
recourse when they believe their rights under federal labor law
have been violated.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government itself can still sue on a state
employee's behalf, but the Department of Labor is not equipped to
bring more than a token number of such lawsuits on behalf of the
4.7 million people in the country who work for state governments.
</P>
<P>
   The other two federalism cases grew out of lawsuits by the
College Savings Bank, based in Princeton, N.J., against the state
of Florida, a competitor in the marketplace for investment funds
for college tuition. The College Savings Bank charged Florida with
false advertising of the state program, in violation of federal
trademark law, and with infringing its patent on its investment
program.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion by Rehnquist, Florida Prepaid vs. College Savings
Bank, No. 98-531, held that the states are immune from patent
infringement suits, while Scalia wrote for the majority in College
Savings Bank vs. Florida Prepaid, No. 98-149, that states are also
immune from trademark suits.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON ADMINISTRATION LOSES ON CENSUS
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the Clinton administration's plan to conduct the 2000
Census with the help of statistical sampling, the court ruled by a
5-4 vote that the Census Act made the traditional head count
mandatory for the figures that will be used to apportion the House
of Representatives. The court indicated that statistical
adjustments may be made for the other purposes of the Census,
including state redistricting and the distribution of federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor wrote for the majority in Department of Commerce vs.
U.S. House of Representatives, No. 98-404. The dissenters were
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.

   ON CRIMINAL LAW ISSUES, SOME REINING IN OF AUTHORITY
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down a Chicago anti-loitering ordinance that
was aimed at preventing gang members from controlling neighborhood
streets. The law authorized the police to arrest anyone who,
refusing a police order to move on, remained ``in one place with no
apparent purpose'' in the presence of a suspected gang member.
Voting 6-3 in Chicago vs. Morales, No. 97-1121, the court said the
ordinance gave too much discretion to the police to target innocent
people. Stevens wrote the majority opinion. Scalia dissented, along
with Rehnquist and Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In a case growing out of an independent counsel's prosecution of
Mike Espy, the Clinton administration's former secretary of
agriculture, the court ruled unanimously that giving gifts to a
federal official does not violate the law against illegal
gratuities unless there is a demonstrated connection between the
gifts and the official's actions. Scalia wrote the opinion in
United States vs. Sun-diamond, No. 98-131, which rejected the
independent counsel's expansive theory of the gratuity statute.
</P>
<P>
   There were several cases dealing with police behavior and
raising questions of privacy under the Fourth Amendment's
prohibition against unreasonable searches. Among these was the
court's unanimous ruling that the police violate ``the right of
residential privacy at the core of the Fourth Amendment'' when they
take journalists and photographers into people's homes to witness
searches or arrests. Rehnquist wrote the opinion in Wilson vs.
Layne, No. 98-83.
</P>
<P>
   In another search case, the court ruled, 5-4, that people who
are temporarily in a private home to conduct business there may not
challenge the validity of a search of the home, because they
themselves have no ``legitimate expectation of privacy'' there.
Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion in Minnesota vs. Carter, No.
97-1147. Ginsburg dissented, along with Stevens, Souter and Breyer.
A concurring opinion by Kennedy suggested that a social guest,
rather than someone doing business, would be able to challenge a
search.
</P>
<P>
   Two search cases concerned automobiles. The court ruled
unanimously, in another opinion by Rehnquist, that issuing a
speeding ticket does not automatically give the police the
authority to search the car. The case was Knowles vs. Iowa, No.
97-7597.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the court also ruled that once the police do
have probable cause to search a car, they can search the personal
belongings _ in this case, a pocketbook _ of passengers who are
themselves under no suspicion of illegal activity. The vote in
Wyoming vs. Houghton, No. 98-184, was 6-3. Scalia wrote the
majority opinion, and Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 5-4, the court upheld the first death sentence to come
before it under the new, greatly expanded federal death penalty
law, rejecting a challenge to the jury instructions along with
other issues. Thomas wrote the majority opinion in Jones vs. U.S.,
No. 97-9361, with dissenting votes by Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   IN DISABILITY CASES, A NARROWER DEFINITION
</P>
<P>
   In a series of three cases, all decided by the same 7-2 vote,
the court took a restrictive view of the definition of disability
under the Americans With Disabilities Act. People whose impairments
can be alleviated by medication, glasses or other devices are
generally not disabled and so do not come under the law's
protection against employment discrimination, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   In two of the cases, the disability claims the court rejected
were based on vision problems. O'Connor wrote the majority opinion
in Sutton vs. United Air Lines, No. 97-1943, finding that two
nearsighted sisters, with vision correctable to 20/20, were not
disabled despite the airline's refusal to hire them because of
their vision. In Albertsons Inc. vs. Kirkingburg, No. 98-591,
Souter wrote for the majority, rejecting a discrimination claim by
a truck driver who was dismissed because he was functionally blind
in one eye.
</P>
<P>
   In Murphy vs. United Parcel Service, No. 97-1992, O'Connor wrote
for the majority that an employer did not discriminate by
dismissing a truck driver whose high blood pressure prevented him
from obtaining federal certification to drive a truck. Stevens and
Breyer dissented in these cases.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving a separate issue under the Americans With Disabilities
Act, the court ruled 6-3 that isolating people with disabilities in
big state institutions when there is no medical reason for their
confinement is a form of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   This decision, Olmstead vs. L.C., No. 98-536, did not require
states to move patients en masse into group homes, but said that
states should have a plan for doing so at a ``reasonable pace''
when medically appropriate and not unduly disruptive to the state's
budget. Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion, with Thomas, Scalia
and Rehnquist voting in dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting another federal law, the Individuals With
Disabilities Education Act, the court ruled that students with
disabilities who require special care during the school day are
entitled to the care at public expense, as long as a doctor is not
required to deliver the necessary services. The vote in Cedar
Rapids vs. Garrett F., No. 96-1793, was 7-2. Stevens wrote the
majority opinion. Thomas and Kennedy dissented.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled unanimously that a worker who has applied for or
received disability benefits under Social Security is not barred by
that fact from suing an employer for discrimination under the
Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer wrote the opinion in Cleveland vs. Policy Management
Systems, No. 97-1008, which reconciled an apparent conflict in the
two laws: Social Security, which provides benefits to those too
disabled to work, and the disabilities law, which protects those
who can work if provided with reasonable accommodations.

   FOR THE HARASSED AND THE POOR: A STRENGTHENING OF RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting the federal law that bars sex discrimination in
schools, the court ruled 5-4 that school districts can be liable
for damages for failing to stop one student from subjecting another
to severe and pervasive sexual harassment. O'Connor wrote the
majority opinion in Davis vs. Monroe County, No. 97-843. Kennedy
dissented, along with the chief justice, Scalia and Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that state welfare programs may not restrict new
residents to the welfare benefits they would have received in their
home states. The 7-2 decision, Saenz vs. Roe, No. 98-97, had the
effect of overturning a portion of the new federal welfare law,
which authorized states to set up two-tiered benefit systems.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion, written by Stevens, was also significant for its
reliance on the long-ignored Privileges or Immunities Clause of the
14th Amendment, a possible signal that this provision, which
provides that ``no state shall make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States,'' could become a new source of protection for individual
rights. Rehnquist and Thomas dissented.
</P>
<P>
   A unanimous opinion, the latest to examine a much-disputed
congressional district in North Carolina, held that district lines
drawn primarily for political reasons are not invalid simply
because they are drawn with a consciousness of the district's
racial composition.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Hunt vs. Cromartie, No. 98-85, overturned a
judgment that North Carolina's 12th Congressional District, which
is heavily Democratic and 47 percent black, was an unconstitutional
racial gerrymander. Thomas' majority opinion appeared to give the
states some breathing room as they prepare for the post-2000 round
of redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the court held that companies making ``good
faith efforts'' to comply with federal anti-discrimination laws
will not be liable for punitive damages, even if a senior official
intentionally violates company policy and the law.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Kolstad vs. American Dental Association, No.
98-208, interpreted a 1991 amendment to the Civil Rights Act of
1964, which for the first time authorized awards of punitive
damages for intentional job discrimination. O'Connor wrote the
majority opinion, from which Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   CASINOS AND VOTER INITIATIVES WIN ON FREE SPEECH GROUNDS
</P>
<P>
   The justices unanimously struck down a 65-year-old federal ban
on broadcast advertising of casino gambling. Writing for the court
in Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assoc. vs. U.S., No. 98-387,
Stevens said the law ``sacrifices an intolerable amount of truthful
speech about lawful conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision extolling the First Amendment value of
uninhibited ``communication with voters,'' the court struck down
Colorado's restrictions on the process of getting initiatives on
the ballot. Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in Buckley vs.
American Constitutional Law Foundation, No. 97-930, while Rehnquist
and O'Connor and Breyer dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Among the regulations the decision invalidated were requirements
that people circulating petitions be registered Colorado voters and
wear badges identifying themselves by name.
</P>
<P>
   IMMIGRATION CASES MEAN MORE AUTHORITY FOR GOVERNMENT
</P>
<P>
   An area in which the court gave considerable deference to the
government was immigration law, with the court sharing Congress'
and the administration's narrow view of the rights of noncitizens.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled, 6-3, in a deportation case involving a group of
Palestinians in Los Angeles, that the government does not violate
the Constitution by selecting aliens for deportation based on their
political views and associations. Scalia wrote the majority opinion
in Reno vs. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, No.
97-1252, with Ginsburg, Souter and Breyer dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   In a second deportation case the court ruled unanimously that
foreigners who have committed serious crimes in their home
countries are ineligible for refugee status here regardless of the
risk of persecution they face if deported. Kennedy's opinion in
Immigration and Naturalization Service vs. Aguirre, No. 97-1754,
upheld the Clinton administration's view of how a would-be
refugee's criminal past should be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   IN BUSINESS-CONSUMER CASES RULINGS FOR BOTH SIDES
</P>
<P>
   Among a number of important business cases, the court limited
much of the Federal Communications Commission's authority to
supervise telephone deregulation under the Telecommunications Act
of 1996. Scalia wrote the majority opinion in AT&AMP;T Corp. vs. Iowa
Utilities Board, No. 97-826. The vote was 5-3, with Souter, Thomas
and Breyer dissenting and O'Connor not participating.
</P>
<P>
   A unanimous opinion on the use of expert testimony was a
substantial victory for defendants in product liability suits. In
Kumho Tire vs. Carmichael, No. 97-1709, the court gave federal
judges new authority to keep expert testimony of questionable
reliability away from juries. Breyer wrote the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In an important ruling on how the judicial system should handle
class action lawsuits in mass tort cases, the court set aside a
$1.5-billion settlement in an asbestos suit, covering some 186,000
claims, on the ground that it was unfair to other asbestos victims,
and was the product of a possible conflict of interest on the part
of the lawyers who designed and settled the case.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in Ortiz vs. Fibreboard Corp., No. 97-1704, was 7-2.
Souter wrote the majority opinion, and Breyer and Stevens
dissented.

FLYING ON VACATION? TAKE THE CAR SEAT
</HEADLINE>
  By REBECCA BAUMGOLD 
 c.1999 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years go this month, Ruth Ness left her Colorado home to
visit her parents in New York. Ruth was flying with a friend,
Debbie McKelvey, and her kids, Devon, 5, and Ryan, 7.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, they boarded United Airlines flight 232, which would
take them to Chicago. They never made it: Their DC-10 aircraft
crashed into a cornfield in Sioux City, Iowa, and 112 of the 296
passengers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   'We were flying along, when all of a sudden there was an
explosion at the back of the plane. We just started to drop,''
remembers Ness, now a 37-year-old mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eventually,'' she continues, ''Captain Haynes came on and
explained to us what was happening _ we were going to make an
emergency landing in Sioux City.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flight attendants told us to take off our glasses and
tighten our seat belts,'' Ness recalls. ''They said that any parent
holding an infant in her lap should wrap the baby in a blanket,
place him on the floor, and grip him between her legs,'' the
standard crash procedure for unrestrained children.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the infants, this was not enough protection. One
baby was killed on impact when he was torn from his mother's hold.
Another baby was thrown 15 rows and landed in an overhead bin.
Incredibly, a passenger heard his cries and was able to rescue him
from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The tremendous force of the crash caused the huge jetliner to
break into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ''The part of the plane I was in flipped upside down and slid. I
could see fire and smoke and hear muffled voices,'' says Ness.
''When we stopped, Devon and I were hanging upside down in our
seats. I unhooked myself and Devon, and we fell to the floor _
actually the ceiling _ of the plane. I picked her up and tried to
find a way out. Luckily someone shouted out, 'This way,'and I
turned around and followed.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ness carried Devon out of the plane, she found herself in a
cornfield, surrounded by stalks 6 feet tall. When they emerged,
they saw a group of stunned survivors huddled together. Amazingly,
Devon's mom and brother were among them, also unhurt
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, devastating plane crashes like the one Ruth Ness
survived are exceedingly rare. In fact, the chance of being hurt or
killed in a car is thousands of times greater than the chance of
being hurt or killed in a plane.
</P>
<P>
   But while fatal crashes are rare, injuries from turbulence and
rough landings are more common _ and, luckily, you can do something
about them. Today, Ness and her husband, Roy, fly several times a
year with their kids.
</P>
<P>
   But as a mother and a crash survivor, Ness wants all parents to
become informed about air safety when flying with children.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the information you need to know:  &UR; Car seats: the bottom
line &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing safety experts agree on, it's this: The
only safe way for kids 40 pounds and under to fly is in an approved
car seat. Look for a label saying the seat is certified for use in
cars and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Safe
Kids Campaign both strongly urge parents to use car seats.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, the agency that
investigates airline crashes, and the Association of Flight
Attendants (AFA) go further. They have lobbied Congress for years
to pass a law requiring car seats for kids under age 2 although
currently, a child under 2 can fly for free in an adult's lap.
</P>
<P>
   ''By law, everything on board an aircraft, from laptops to
luggage, must be properly secured or stowed during takeoff and
landing, except for kids under 2,'' says Patricia Friend,
international president of the AFA and a flight attendant for 30
years. As Sioux City and similar tragedies have shown, ''it is just
physically impossible for a parent to hold onto an unrestrained
child in severe turbulence or an accident,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   As in a car, infants under 20 pounds should use a rearfacing
seat; kids 20 to 40 pounds should use a forward-facing seat.
Children over 40 pounds can safely use the airplane seat belt.
Check that your car seat measures 16 inches or less across; any
wider and it may not fit.
</P>
<P>
   When booking a flight, you must purchase a ticket for kids under
2 to guarantee that you'll be able to use a car seat.Most airlines
offer significantly discounted fares to make this an affordable
option. If you can't afford a ticket for your child, ask the
airline which flights will be most likely to have empty seats.
Off-peak flights are typically early morning, late night and
midweek afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   And ask if the airline offers preboarding _ a real convenience
when it comes to stowing carry-ons and strapping in car seats _
since it's no longer standard practice on all flights.
 &UR; How to reduce the risks whenever you fly &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, the biggest danger you face when traveling on an
airplane is turbulence _ rough patches of air that often occur
without warning and can significantly jostle the plane. In nonfatal
accidents, turbulence is the leading cause of passenger injuries
each year.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is simple: Make sure that everyone stays buckled in
an appropriate restraint. For kids 40 pounds and under, this means
a car seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''When turbulence hits, a child held in a parent's lap can be
thrown high enough to hit the ceiling. The only sure way to prevent
this is with a car seat,'' Friend notes.
</P>
<P>
   For children who weigh more than 40 pounds, protection means
making sure they keep their seat belt on whenever seated. ''I tell
parents to look at seat belts in a plane as they do seat belts in a
car,'' says Friend . ''You wouldn't unbuckle yourself or your child
in a car going 50 1 miles an hour, so why would you do so in a
plane going 500 miles an hour?''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential for danger? Planes overstuffed with carry-on
bags.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA estimates that 4,000 passengers a year are injured by
carry-on bags. And the problem is growing, prompting safety
officials to call for a reduction in the number of carry-ons
allowed on flights.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are often hit by bags when packed overhead bins are
opened in flight, and bins have even been known to pop open,'' says
Friend.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's important to pay attention to the safety
demonstration given by the flight attendants before takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each aircraft is a little different in terms of where the
emergency exits and flotation devices are,'' explains Friend. Ness
agrees: ''I always pay attention, and look around to memorize the
closest exits. And when my kids are old enough, I'll talk through
the safety presentation and point out the exits to them. It helps
me feel in control, like I've done my part to protect us.'' &QL;

ATTACK SURVIVOR NOW HAS NAME TO GO WITH FACE SHE CAN'T FORGET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ The attacker may not remember her face.
</P>
<P>
   She cannot forget his.
</P>
<P>
   And now the 22-year-old woman believes she has a name to go with
it: Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the cross-country drifter suspected of
riding the rails en route to at least eight homicides in three
states. She marvels that she did not die as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's bothered more now that he has been identified,'' said a
person close to the woman, who is the only survivor of the rampage
that put Resendez-Ramirez on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. ``She
doesn't like to be alone. If her parents are gone she stays with
her married sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she's doing great,'' the source added. ``She's a very
strong young lady. She is one of those people who will probably
volunteer at crisis centers for the rest of her life because of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 29, 1997, the woman, whose name is being withheld to
protect her privacy, survived a vicious attack in which her
boyfriend was killed. The couple were at a popular hangout for
students a mile or so from the University of Kentucky campus.
Unfortunately for them, its attraction lies in the dual set of
Norfolk Southern Railway tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Sorrell, a Lexington police detective, recalled last week
that the woman and 21-year-old Christopher Maier were still getting
to know each other. They had gone to a friend's house on Suburban
Court, a maple tree-lined street of nicely kept, World War II-era
homes that dead-ends at the tracks. About 1:30 a.m. they and two
other friends decided to walk down there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a steel tower that goes over the tracks,'' Sorrell
said. ``They would go down there and hang around at the bottom of
the tower. I think some kids have gotten up on the tower to watch
the trains go underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   When no trains rolled by after about 20 minutes, the two
friends, both male, returned to the house. Maier and the woman
remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ... had only been dating a few months,'' Sorrell said.
``So they stayed there talking.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple talked for half an hour before deciding to leave. As
they headed back, a man burst from the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   He grabbed Maier, forced him to the ground and dragged him to a
dense tangle of brush on the eastern side of the tracks, ordering
the woman to follow. He restrained them with a cord and demanded
money.
</P>
<P>
   Maier and the woman tried to comply, said Sorrell. They offered
the keys to Maier's car. They said they could get money for him.
They would give him their ATM cards. They would give him the access
numbers. They would do whatever he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christopher just kept saying `Don't do anything to her. Don't
hurt the girl,''' Sorrell said.
</P>
<P>
   But the attacker became more agitated with each plea. At one
point he gagged both of them.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was able to free herself and even attempted to unbind
Maier, but the man stopped her with brutal force and bound her
again.
</P>
<P>
   After determining neither had money, the man picked up an object
(another investigative source says it was a rock) and bludgeoned
Maier in the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He then turned on the female victim,'' Sorrell said. ``She
physically attempted to fight him off by kicking and thrashing at
him. But he became more violent. She had no choice but to comply.''
</P>
<P>
   During her struggle, the woman could hear gurgling noises coming
from Maier and asked the attacker to position him so he would not
drown in his own blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspect got off her for a moment, then came back and said,
`Don't worry, he's gone,''' Sorrell said.
</P>
<P>
   What took place next should have killed the woman.
</P>
<P>
   She was raped and beaten, possibly with a board or a rock. She
suffered a broken jaw, a crushed eye socket and numerous gashes and
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   She fought as much as she could until the man told her how easy
it would be to kill her, Sorrell said. ``It was at that point she
quit resisting.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward the man walked away, leaving the unconscious woman for
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The exact length of the attack is not clear. According to police
documents the first report came in about 4:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before then, the woman had become alert enough to
stagger to a nearby house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door was opened to that residence,'' Sorrell said. ``She
just walked in and the person living there helped get the gag off
of her and called the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Goetz was a fellow UK student.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a bad dream,'' Goetz told a local television news
reporter. ``I woke up and there was a bloody person at my door.''
</P>
<P>
   Goetz said he didn't know who the woman was until sometime later
when he received an e-mail thanking him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I did was open my door, sit her on the couch,
call 911 and talk to her,'' Goetz said. ``I hope someone would have
the same common courtesy for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maier's body was found later near the tracks north of the steel
tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, Christopher Maier did exactly what has been
taught by police agencies for years as to how to react,'' Sorrell
said. ``He looked out for the welfare of his female companion. He
complied with the suspect's demands, offered money, his car. He did
everything that you're supposed to do. But he just ran into a
killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sacrificed his life trying to protect the female victim.
...''
</P>
<P>
   There was no solid suspect in the case until about three weeks
ago, when DNA samples collected in Lexington were matched to those
at two crime scenes in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, Dr. Claudia Benton, 39, was found stabbed to death
in her home in West University Place, an enclave of Houston. On
April 30, the Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 46, and his wife, Karen,
47, were beaten to death with a sledgehammer in Weimar.
Fingerprints and other evidence have linked Resendez-Ramirez to
those and three other Texas homicides.
</P>
<P>
   He is suspected in the June 4 slaying of 73-year-old Josephine
Konvicka at her home in Fayette County near Weimar; the June 5
death of Noemi Dominguez, 26, near Houston's Texas Medical Center;
and the June 15 deaths of 79-year-old George Morber and his
daughter Carolyn Frederick, 51, in Gorham, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her fear has always been that somebody else may be subject to
what she was,'' Sorrell said of the Kentucky survivor. ``And to
learn his identity by linking it to the deaths of three other
people in Texas, and now that number has risen, has really been an
emotional trauma for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman has declined to talk publicly until Resendez-Ramirez
is captured, but the person close to the family said she is coping
well and plans to resume her college education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's pondered why she's the only one who's lived, why
she was blessed,'' said Sorrell.
</P>
<P>
   With the increasing frequency of attacks, authorities added
Resendez-Ramirez to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. They have
organized a nationwide manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged last week with murder, assault, robbery and rape
in the Kentucky case and faces murder charges in the two Illinois
deaths. A federal warrant also has been issued for his arrest for
unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. The charge stems from the
burglary charge in Harris County, stemming from the Benton killing,
and allows the continued involvement of federal agents in the case.
</P>
<P>
   All of the victims have lived or have been near train tracks,
allowing Resendez-Ramirez to escape quickly and travel across the
country by illegally stowing away on trains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a high-profile crime for us since it occurred,''
Sorrell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 20 to 25 homicides a year here. We don't have
many serial killers come through.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime, and recent sightings of the suspect about 70 miles
away in Louisville, have made people more cautious in this
university town in the heart of Kentucky's horse country.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had sort of gotten past it, and back into their normal
routine,'' said Phillip Thompson, manager of a small auto repair
shop next to the tracks, about a block from the crime scene. ``Now
they're a little more aware again, especially with what's in the
news right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Johnson, 43, has lived on Suburban Court for 26 years.
She said she, her husband and their young daughter, niece and
nephew take a few more precautions than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody just wants that dummy to be caught,'' she said.
``I've got a big dog in the back of my house and a gun in the
front. If he ever tries to come in my house, he's gonna be laid
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said she and her neighbors still see vagrants along the
tracks only ``every blue moon.'' The UK kids still hang out there,
if not as frequently as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we just take it one day at a time,'' she said. ``I've
told the kids to keep the door locked and to be a little more
cautious.''

LATEST BOOK OUT OF THE BOX
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) 
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There's this box. About as big as _ and the same
shape as _ a refrigerator turned on its side. It's painted white.
There's a folding door at one end of it. When the door folds back,
a cloud of warm humid air emerges, followed by Po Bronson.
</P>
<P>
   He's thin. Male-model good-looking. At 35, Bronson is one of the
hottest writers of the moment. His current book, ``The Nudist on
the Night Shift,'' was just excerpted in this month's Wired
magazine, which featured Bronson's face on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nudist'' follows the trials and tribulations of the young men
and women coming to San Francisco and Silicon Valley, looking to
carve out their share of the overheated digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bronson's bio, found at www.pobronson.com, includes a stint as a
24-year-old mid-six-figure bond salesman. Which led to a book,
``Bombardiers,'' about hyperactive bond traders. Which led to
another book, ``The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest'' about
hyperactive technology start-ups. Which led to a movie deal. Which
also led to a kudo from Tom Wolfe, who has proclaimed Bronson as _
wait for it _ the next Tom Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's that box. Bronson writes in the box, shut off
from the world by headphones, the CD player set on repeat. The box
sits deep inside The Grotto, a Folsom Street writers' cooperative.
It's where we met him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What prompted ``Nudist''?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it's very cool that a lot of young people are excited
these days about Silicon Valley. It's cool that they're drawn here
from all over the country. Youth are custom-made for the change.
Every three months they get a whole new set of classes in school.
Every summer they get a new job. Then they graduate and it's ``slow
down'' and ``oh God, I'm going to have this job for the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   They're moving out here like crazy. You always read these
retrospective stories. How did they make their money? Did they
deserve it? I wanted to do a longitudinal study.
</P>
<P>
   Follow them from the day that they got here. I met about 20 and
I followed them for the last three years. In the end they were all
doing pretty well. And it was not that long ago that they were all
still eating pancakes. I wanted to see if it was all a myth, or is
it really a popular phenomenon. To see what would really happen to
you if you moved out here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you a techie?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not interested in technology. I write people stories. I
don't find the technology itself as interesting as how technology
triggers a culture, how it changes people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You were on Wall Street during the junk bond days. Are we
repeating this here on the West Coast?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was an investment banker in '87-'88. We were going up
against Michael Milken. We were trading against the crash. Back
then, there was still sort of the remnants of the old-school
around. These guys from New Jersey who had worked their way up from
the mailroom. There was that kind of hubris created by that, with
all the new people coming into this world. That helped lead to the
crash. Now, that crash was short lived. But that culture never came
back.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So no Gordon Geckos?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am worried about too many people coming in just for the
score. I'm worried that writers will jump ship and go work for
these companies, because they're jealous or they're tired of making
writers pay. I hope my book reflects this. That it's a fight for
the soul of this business. I wanted to explore the question: Is it
flaunted wealth at Woodside, or is it people who are here for the
adventure and the spirit, and the money is a by-product.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You live and write in San Francisco, and have spent a lot of
time in Silicon Valley. Do you see any differences between the city
and the Valley?
</P>
<P>
   A: Radically different. People here (in the city) are media
savvy, but much more aware of what they're giving up. It's
different in the Valley. There's a much higher level of cynicism in
San Francisco. But there are tons of greedy, greedy people in the
Valley. There's sort of this sheer jealously driving people.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's reaching critical mass.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sheer jealously?
</P>
<P>
   A: For a lot of people out here, it was just dumb luck that they
were at the right company to make a couple of millions bucks. But
for others, to watch your generation sort of move up _ that's
tough. I spoke to people this weekend who were headed for Harvard
Business School, who now won't go. They want to get in on the big
score. But my book doesn't turn up its nose at that culture. It has
a lot of fun with it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will people stop talking to you after this book comes out.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm sure there's going to be the ``I don't like how you
portrayed me.'' But that's part of the business. I'm not too
worried about that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are Internet stocks due for a crash?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think about that every day. Obviously, these Internet
valuations lack real value, but the issue is, can the momentum
continue. I don't see any slowing down in the venture capital
investments in these types of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's with writing in the box?
</P>
<P>
   A: It just walls me off from everybody. I go in there, and it's
just me and the writing. I like that.

ON A WING &AMP; A PRAYER: AIRLINES ENLIST CHEFS TO IMPROVE MEALS AT
35,000 FEET

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ The hectic pace was nothing new for the former
waitress.
</P>
<P>
   It would take time, though, for Resa Kelly to get used to the
rocking and rolling of this dining room _ a Boeing 757.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the upside-down world of what I do,'' says the Houston
chef, grabbing the lobster tail with du Barry sauce from the flight
attendant and scuttling down the aisle to deliver the appetizer to
the passenger in seat 4F.
</P>
<P>
   Returning for another plate, Kelly is thrown off-balance by the
turbulence that would cause flight attendants and passengers to
feel like tossed salads at the end of the day. In the galley,
several unwrapped food trays shot out of the storage cart like
aluminum rocket ships. Glasses of water turned over, causing a
minor flood at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like working in a kitchen during an earthquake,'' says
Kelly, the owner of Resa's Prime Steak and Piano Bar in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old restaurateur was recently added to the roster of
notable chefs enlisted by Continental Airlines to redesign and
revamp its food.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly joins celebrity chefs Michael Cordua of Americas and
Churrascos in Houston, Don Pintabona of Tribeca Grill in New York
City and Roy Yamaguchi of Roy's restaurants worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And like them, she will serve as the in-flight chef on several
of the airline's transcontinental and international flights
throughout the year, trying to get a better understanding of the
food service on board an aircraft 35,000 feet above ground.
</P>
<P>
   She will then apply the information to develop menus for the
airline's business, first-class and, eventually, coach cabins.
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds like a restaurant with wings, that is exactly
the point, and Houston-based Continental is the first to admit that
the Chef on Board program is a great publicity tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a learning opportunity for the chefs; but it's also great
PR for us to show customers that there's a lot of thought put into
our food,'' says Siegfried Lang, managing director of food and
beverage planning.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly signed up for the 6:45 p.m. flight from Newark, N.J., to
San Francisco. Standing inside the 5-by-6-foot galley, the mother
of three struggles to unwrap the layers of plastic wrap around the
plates of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to suggest that they start using plastic covers.
It'll be easier for the flight attendants to remove,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Continental's transcontinental business and first-class
passengers dine on menus designed by the celebrity chefs. The
five-course meal on this flight was created by Pintabona, executive
chef of Tribeca Grill. It features selections such as a mixed grill
of veal, lamb and beef; macadamia-crusted salmon; breast of duck;
and spinach ravioli with Alfredo sauce.
</P>
<P>
   As flight attendant Steve Miller transfers the entrees to the
plates, Kelly helps with the presentation, adding a few fine-dining
touches by artfully crossing the asparagus and drizzling sauces
around the vegetables _ an attention to detail that may seem
revolutionary. But Continental isn't the only airline trying to
transpose cabin dining into fine dining; its competitors have also
jumped on board.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, United Airlines convinced internationally
celebrated chef Jacques Pepin to bring his cooking on board
selected domestic flights. But already on the Chicago-based
airline's payroll are such familiar faces as Martin Yan of PBS-TV's
``Yan Can Cook'' series and Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger of
the Food Network's ``Too Hot Tamales'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's not going to be a restaurant per se. We just want
to emulate some of its features and to bring a fine-dining
experience along with the long-haul air experience,'' says Bob
Braden, United Airlines's manager for on-board service planning for
North America.
</P>
<P>
   To get an edge on competitors, it seems, airline executives are
banking on better food _ this after years of slashing in-flight
meals and snacks to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's greater competition among the carriers in the total
perception of the product by customers. Food is a big part of
that,'' explains Lynda Zane, senior director of dining services for
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly joins a long list of culinary luminaries upgrading and
updating airline food, including Paul Prudhomme for American
Airlines, Michel Roux for British Airways and Raymond Blanc for
Virgin Atlantic. But not every flier will sample creations by the
celebrity chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the celebrity chefs are involved in first-class or
international meals. Celebrity chefs don't seem to touch much on
the rest of the passengers,'' says Randy Petersen, editor and
publisher of InsideFlyer magazine and an expert on frequent-flier
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity chefs have been around for 20 years. None of them
has made any long-lasting impression on what airline food is today.
It will never, ever change.''
</P>
<P>
   Most industry watchers agree that airline food is often driven
by economics. Right now, the airlines are flying high financially _
hence the attempt to upgrade the food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can all imagine that if the industry isn't doing well,
we'll all be back to peanuts,'' Petersen says.
</P>
<P>
   While the first-class passengers on this Continental flight
munch on duck, veal and lamb, those in the coach cabin are chewing
on chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starving. I haven't eaten since 10:30 this morning,''
says Mark Tolanel of New Jersey, looking down at his empty tray in
coach. ``It was really just mediocre. But the food, at least, comes
to you warmer than it used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Michael Hales, 26, is finishing off his bean-and-rice
burrito.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they had better desserts. Just because we're
vegetarians doesn't mean we don't like fatty, creamy-filled foods.
This is no fun,'' he complains, waving a small cinnamon twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I got this stuff on the ground, I would never go back to
the restaurant,'' girlfriend Joanna Brief adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're being too critical, especially since the food is
complimentary,'' Hales says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Complimentary?'' Brief replies. ``You're paying for it!''
</P>
<P>
   On average, airlines spend $2-$4 per person on domestic flights,
according to industry insiders. International flights range from
$30 to $50 per person per flight, because airlines serve more
elaborate meals and free alcohol on longer hauls.
</P>
<P>
   Continental will spend about $250 million this year on in-flight
food service. The air carrier serves up about 80,000 meals daily.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly can grill a mean steak at her restaurant in Houston. But
up in the air, she does little cooking since the meals are already
prepared and partly cooked in one of the airline's six Chelsea
Catering kitchens around the country. Her job on board is to simply
switch on the convection oven, which will reheat the food at 350
degrees for 15 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't from the kitchen to the table. It has to go through
two other steps to get to your plate,'' Kelly says. ``It's a real
challenge coming up with dishes that will withstand all those
steps. But it's just a matter of picking out things that will
translate well.''
</P>
<P>
   What Kelly hopes will work are her bread soup bowls, which
Continental will introduce in a couple of months. What she's
certain won't work are dishes such as poached eggs, risottos and
souffles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you need to eat immediately isn't going to be good,''
Kelly says. ``They're not cooking back there; they're plating what
has already been prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the first-class cabin, Houston businessman Mark
Weisberger chomps appreciatively on his lobster tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food has gotten better. There's more variety now,'' he
says. ``I haven't seen anyone dump anything on anybody's lap in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of miles _ and one meal _ away from Newark, the plane
is 45 minutes from San Francisco. The food has been served. The
dishes have been cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around the galley, Kelly shakes her head in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been tough. You're working in a space that wouldn't
meet a Texas woman's requirement of a closet,'' she says. ``The
turbulence was really interesting, too. For a while, we were riding
that bucking bronco in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   But she survived, and the airlines hope the program will
survive, too.
</P>

OVERLOOKED `STILL CRAZY' AND `RUSHMORE' SHARE DEFIANT SPIRIT &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   One value of video is it gives films a second chance. Two movies
reaching video Tuesday deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-made ``Rushmore'' (R, Touchstone, CC, priced for rental)
and British ``Still Crazy'' (R, Columbia TriStar, CC, priced for
rental) are birds of a feather. Both boast quirky humor,
sensational performances and British rock in their soundtracks _
not to mention a defiant rock spirit in tone.
</P>
<P>
   Both also earned critical praise and Golden Globe nominations
(``Still Crazy'' was nominated for best musical or comedy), then
faltered in theaters via art-house runs that failed to tap their
commercial potential.
</P>
<P>
   With its plot about '70s British rockers reuniting in the '90s,
``Still Crazy'' was pegged by some critics as a cross between ``The
Full Monty'' and ``This Is Spinal Tap.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy'' is a potent, feel-good entity in itself. It
isn't about male strippers, nor is it a mock documentary about
witless head-bangers. It's one of the best rock movies since ``A
Hard Day's Night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy'' depicts the fictional Strange Fruit, a big-time,
hard-rocking group that played to packed stadiums during its '70s
heyday. Then excesses of drugs, sex and egos _ as well as a literal
lightning bolt _ sent the members scampering to lives of plodding
obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Fate hurls them together again 20 years later for a
nothing-to-lose attempt to surf the nostalgia wave and rekindle the
sparks that once gave them magic.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Rea plays keyboardist Tony, who still longs for former
groupie Karen (Juliet Aubrey), who now manages the band like a
patient den mother. Bolstered by a loyal Scottish roadie (Billy
Connolly of ``Mrs. Brown''), the group takes a bus tour of European
clubs to reassert its chops.
</P>
<P>
   Karen pines for guitarist Brian, who's disappeared and presumed
dead from drugs, in the mold of his late brother, Keith, the first
lead singer.
</P>
<P>
   To replace Brian, the group recruits a hotshot guitarist (Hans
Matheson) who adds youthful credibility alongside the wizened Ray
(Bill Nighy), Keith's '70s replacement. Only Ray has stretched out
his earnings and now lives on a country estate _ though it's fading
and for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Moody bassist Les (Jimmy Nail) resents Ray, belittling him for
being a poser and not a genius. Affable drummer Beano (Timothy
Spall) remains recklessly crazy after all these years.
</P>
<P>
   The tour starts in disaster, but it doesn't end there.
</P>
<P>
   Given a chance, this band can be good _ even great _ as shown in
the stirring power ballad ``The Flame Still Burns'' and the grandly
exuberant ``All Over the World,'' a galvanizing performance that's
3 1/2 minutes of rock 'n' roll glory.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the music is this good, but the songs aren't a
put-on, either. Spinal Tap? Give us a break.
</P>
<P>
   The tunes were written by such real-life rockers as Electric
Light Orchestra's Jeff Lynne, Foreigner's Mick Jones, Squeeze's
Chris Difford and Argent's Russ Ballard. The actors ably do their
own singing; Nail hails from a recording background.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy'' also has a solid film pedigree. It was written
by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, who penned the screenplay for
the ribald Irish soul-music movie ``The Commitments.'' Directing
was Brian Gibson, who did the powerful Tina Turner biopic, ``What's
Love Got to Do With It?''
</P>
<P>
   Their joint work is informed about the music business without
being an in-joke. If anything, ``Still Crazy'' is a universal,
human tale about turning midlife crises into second chances _ about
the flame still burning at any age.
</P>
<P>
   It's also rousingly funny, thanks to Spall's uncouth bluster and
the fragile brilliance of Nighy, a British stage actor who's a real
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   His Ray is a lovably hapless, helpless soul _ a brain-fried,
recovering alcoholic who'd be lost without his support group, from
his bossy Swedish wife (Helena Bergstrom) to his AA meetings to
Karen's calm control of the tour. But Ray poignantly soldiers on,
and onstage he can be superb.
</P>
<P>
   You pull for him _ and the rest of this band _ because you care
for these characters. We laugh with them, not at them, thanks to
filmmakers who respect the liberating spirit of their mission.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, their songs can sound retro and overwrought. But take a
closer listen and they could grow on you.
</P>
<P>
   Strange Fruit may not represent your favorite band, but it does
represent rock itself, and that means a lot. Heck, it means
everything.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Rushmore,'' this artful labor of love from Houston-born
director Wes Anderson was inspired by his years at St. John's
School, where most of the movie was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Max (Jason Schwartzman) is an eager student who throws himself
into wildly diverse clubs and stages bizarre plays. Unfortunately,
he's too busy to pass his classes.
</P>
<P>
   Max finds a new outlet for his fierce focus when he falls for
Mrs. Cross (Olivia Williams), a sweet young teacher who's been
recently widowed. But she's also courted by Mr. Blume (Bill
Murray), a wealthy, depressed alumnus who's befriended Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love her,'' Mr. Blume informs the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved her first,'' Max responds with irrefutable kid-speak
logic.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Anderson and Owen Wilson, ``Rushmore'' has many
inspirations but can be wildly original, from its strange plot to
the intriguing contradictions in its hero _ or antihero, as in
Dustin Hoffman's equally obsessive romantic in ``The Graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman was worth the lengthy casting search. Somehow he's
both arrogant and naive, slick and klutzy, lovable and
exasperating.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray was an actor first, and his strong body of work
entitled him to an Oscar nomination for this funny-sad performance,
recognition he was denied.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also is memorable as the grieving but hopeful Mrs.
Cross, and the young supporting cast _ including many Houstonians _
is impressive. The strong song score also is a star in itself.
</P>
<P>
   You may not embrace ``Rushmore'' upon first viewing. It's
decidedly different _ an adjustment. But give it a chance.
Originality deserves that much.

BUSH LISTENED _ AND LEARNED _ FROM BULLOCK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, in eulogizing Bob Bullock,
praised the late Texas leader for reaching out to a ``green
governor across parties and generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, indeed, reached out. But Bush, as a rookie in statewide
politics in 1994, was savvy enough to reach out to Bullock first,
and Bush's initiative was key to what became a strong working
relationship and close friendship between the veteran, wily
Democrat and the younger, up-and-coming Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Without Bush's overtures and Bullock's response back
then, the governor's face may not have recently graced the covers
of a couple of national news magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In all fairness, it would be too much of a stretch to say that
Bullock's help during the governor's first term led to Bush's
commanding presence in the presidential race now. Several other
factors _ including a well-known name, an inherited money-raising
network and a dearth of strong GOP opposition _ also are at play.
</P>
<P>
   But Bullock, as lieutenant governor and the Senate's presiding
officer, was instrumental in giving Bush the early legislative
victories and the success story that Bush is now touting throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat, House Speaker Pete Laney, was equally helpful
in securing easy approval of the civil justice, education, welfare
and juvenile justice changes that Bush made the cornerstone of his
first legislative session and parlayed into overwhelming public
popularity for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, often controversial during four decades of public
service and never shy about messing with governors from his own
Democratic Party, was a potential stumbling block for a new
governor, particularly a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   While state comptroller, Bullock had held a news conference in
early 1983, just as fellow Democrat Mark White was moving into the
governor's office, to announce that he was going to run for
governor in the next election. Bullock never did run for the higher
office, but his announcement was no less an affront to White.
</P>
<P>
   And shortly after taking office as lieutenant governor in 1991,
Bullock put Gov. Ann Richards, another Democrat, on the spot by
openly advocating a state income tax _ one of Texas' biggest
political taboos _ as a solution to a revenue shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious differences between Bullock and Bush were great.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Bullock had fought his way to prominence from a modest
childhood in Hillsboro. Republican Bush was a son of privilege, a
preppie who had attended Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock was almost a generation older than the new governor, and
his knowledge of state government was vastly greater _ an
encyclopedia vs. a few footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush had unseated Richards, Bullock's longtime Democratic
comrade in Texas' political wars.
</P>
<P>
   If ever Bullock was going to give another governor a hard time,
Bush was ripe for it. Or so it would have seemed.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush made a point of taking the first step. He didn't wait
for Bullock to come calling. Before Bush ever took office, he went
to Bullock and got acquainted with him, and if there had been any
potential conflict, it was soon defused.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his critical first legislative session in 1995, Bush
kept communicating privately with Bullock and Laney on his
legislative priorities. And Bush listened _ and learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the imperial governor,'' longtime Bullock aide Tony
Proffitt recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic leaders found Bush a refreshing change from the
Richards administration, when communications between the
legislative and executive branches of government hadn't flowed as
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The good-ol'-boy network may have been a factor in Bush's
ability to relate to Bullock and Laney. And it certainly didn't
hurt that, during that first session, a majority of the
Legislature, Democrats and Republicans alike, shared the governor's
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with the two major parties nearing parity in the
Legislature, the three leaders recognized that bipartisanship was
essential to legislative success.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock angered many Democrats by endorsing Bush for re-election
last year over Democrat Garry Mauro, a former Bullock aide. Bullock
also said early on that he thought Bush would make a good
president.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I know, Bullock never aspired to be president, and
it's just as well. Despite his abilities and accomplishments, he
was too rough around the edges and carried too many battle scars to
ever have had a shot at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, according to the polls, does have a good chance at the
White House. But he will need a Bullocklike toughness to get there.
</P>

HIDDEN CHARGES DESTROY TRAVEL BUDGETS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The travel agent confirmed a rate of $48 per day for a
four-day car rental in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   So why am I staring at a bill for $287.72?
</P>
<P>
   The hotel reservations clerk quoted a $100-per-night tariff for
three nights at an upstate New York hotel.
</P>
<P>
   And yet I'm signing a credit-card receipt for $356.16.
</P>
<P>
   I hear kids in the neighborhood talking about ``new math,'' but
this is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Most other frequent travelers can empathize. Taxes, fees,
surcharges, concessions, gratuities _ no matter what you label
them, these ``hidden costs'' are playing the devil with our
vacation and business travel budgets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FEES ADD UP &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider these addendums to my car-rental bill:
</P>
<P>
   A ``concession fee recovery charge'' of 10 percent. A ``tax
rate'' of 9.18 percent that includes a 3 percent Connecticut
``car-rental surcharge.'' A separate Connecticut ``surcharge'' of
$1 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, I made the mistake of requesting an ``upgraded vehicle.''
No, I didn't ask for a Lincoln Town Car or Corvette; I merely
wanted a Toyota Camry, which I drive at home and knew would prove
more familiar, thus safer, during a 500-mile odyssey on uncharted
roads.
</P>
<P>
   Extra charge: $11 per day; $44 total. For a Camry?
</P>
<P>
   At least I was wise enough to return the car filled with gas.
The ``fuel and service'' charge at the car return center: $3.57 per
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm not trying to pick on Hartford. I've had similar
experiences in other cities. And anyone who followed the debate
over funding for Houston's new downtown baseball stadium knows that
car-rental surcharges have increased dramatically here, too.
</P>
<P>
   Also, according to the Runzheimer Guide to Daily Travel Prices,
Houston's 17 percent lodging tax is the nation's highest. But only
marginally: You'll pay 16 percent in Seattle and 15 percent in
Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee, San Antonio, Austin, Fort Worth and
Amarillo. Yes, Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   What a great partnership U.S. cities have devised. We'll tax
yours; you tax ours. As long as folks don't venture beyond their
living room couches, they'll never be the wiser. Everyone can build
as many stadiums and arenas and conventions centers as they fancy.
</P>
<P>
   Only the traveler is penalized.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MORE SURPRISES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, only a portion of these extra charges has any connection
to sports facilities. My inflated hotel bill, for instance, was the
result of an 8.72 percent taxation and a $10 per day ``gratuity.''
I have no idea who benefited from this money since an additional 17
percent was added to in-house restaurant and bar bills, and
instructions were clear that bellmen and doormen were to be tipped
individually. These types of gratuities are becoming more
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what burns me most, though: I could accept surcharges and
fees and mandatory gratuities if only car-rental firms, hotels and
other travel service providers were conscientious about revealing
their existence in advance of a trip.
</P>
<P>
   I abhor surprises that dent consumers' pocketbooks. And the
impact on many unsuspecting travelers is becoming severe enough to
affect whether taking a trip is even feasible. I appreciate that
car-rental firms and hotels don't benefit from most of these taxes
and fees; on the contrary, the added charges can hurt their
business. But that doesn't absolve them from a responsibility to
tell us the whole story about what we'll pay.
</P>
<P>
   According to Laurie Berger, editor of the monthly Consumer
Reports Travel Letter, ``The National Association of Attorneys
General estimates that surcharges, taxes and fees can increase your
car rental by as much as 75 percent and wipe out any savings earned
from hours spent searching for rock-bottom air fares.'' (Dare I
admit that I chose Hartford over more convenient gateways for my
trip because of a $237 round-trip air fare?)
</P>
<P>
   Berger continues: ``Consumers get surprised by these charges
because rental agents don't always volunteer information about
add-ons over the phone. Most vacationers first confront such
budget-busting fees at the rental counter, where they're least
prepared to make an informed decision.'' (And where they are
already befuddled by pressure to pay for optional insurance; that's
a subject for another day, but suffice it to say that recent
changes deem it more important than ever for business and leisure
travelers to know in advance if rentals are covered by their
corporate or personal automobile policies.)
</P>
<P>
   Failure to disclose all charges is inexcusable; in some
instances it borders on fraud. (And I have a better word for a
$3.57 per gallon refueling charge: gouging.) Remember the criticism
cruise lines took (justifiably) a couple of years back for not
informing passengers clearly about port charges? At least that
information appeared in brochures, albeit often in the tiniest of
print.
</P>
<P>
   The NAAG, according to Berger, has proposed establishing a
car-rental task force to examine advertising prices and how well
fees are disclosed during the reservation process. The public would
be well-served if the organization expanded that project.
</P>
<P>
   Some credit is due companies whose advertisements hint at add-on
costs. Near the bottom of a Hertz promotion in the June 20 Houston
Chronicle Travel section was this disclaimer:
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the rental location, the following charges may
apply: A Vehicle Licensing Fee ranging from 20 cents to 60 cents
per day or from 2 percent to 11.5 percent per rental; an Airport
Facility Use Fee of up to $3 per day or $5 per rental; and an
Airport/Hotel Concession Fee Recovery of up to 12 percent per
rental. Government surcharges, taxes, tax reimbursement and
optional items ... are extra.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a commendable start. But are the words ``ranging from 20
cents ... to 11.5 percent'' vague enough? Telephone reservations
agents, online services and travel agents should be required to
provide travelers a list of all specific costs before a booking is
confirmed. And the same criteria should apply to hotels, tour firms
and others in the travel industry.

PREP STAR WORKOURT IMPRESSES WARRIORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JORGE L. ORTIZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Garry St. Jean likes to tell the story of the
Eastern Conference general manager who insisted that his colleagues
deal with him only over the phone ``so he wouldn't have to lie to
your face.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when few GMs want to meet their peers
in person. As Wednesday's NBA draft approaches, the phone lines are
crackling with phony evaluations, false reports and misinformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't give your hand away,'' said St. Jean, the Warriors'
GM. ``It's OK for people to think that you're moving up or moving
down.''
</P>
<P>
   So, are the Warriors doing either? You'd have better luck
getting St. Jean to give you his ATM card and PIN code than to
answer truthfully.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't kept rumors from circulating, and there are plenty
involving the Warriors. The juiciest one has the club looking to
open up salary cap room to make a run at Mitch Richmond, the
Wizards' free agent shooting guard who has made it clear he would
love to return to the San Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   Even after making a qualifying offer to their own free agent
center Erick Dampier, the Warriors can open up about $2 million in
cap space. That wouldn't be enough to tempt Richmond, who at 34
(Wednesday) is looking to make up for years of being underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the Warriors dumped another big contract, say, John
Starks', which has one year left at $4 million? According to a
source in Atlanta, the Hawks are interested in Starks as a backup
and insurance for Steve Smith, whose injuries in the past have
crippled the team.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is over the cap, but holds a $4.5 million salary
exception from the Christian Laettner trade to Detroit as well as
four draft picks _ Nos. 17, 20, 21 and 27 _ that it could use as
inducement.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean acknowledged that both the Hawks and Jazz are looking
to move some picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there isn't a (Tim) Duncan or a Shaq (O'Neal) in this
draft, and with some teams holding several picks, it opens the door
to more conjecture as to what might happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors generated some conjecture of their own last week
when they worked out UCLA point guard Baron Davis, who is expected
to be a top-four pick. That prompted speculation that Golden State
would look to move up in the draft from its No. 10 spot. Charlotte
has emerged as a possible trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck with two expensive power forwards in Derrick Coleman and
Anthony Mason, the Hornets want to unload one, preferably Coleman
and the last four years of his $40 million contract. They're
dangling the No. 3 pick and may be willing to part with it in
exchange for the Warriors' selection and Donyell Marshall, whom
Golden State desperately wants to move.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets could still get a young point guard to groom _
perhaps Duke's William Avery _ and get rid of an attitude problem
in either Coleman or Mason (two years, $11 million total). The
Warriors aren't likely to bite, even with the temptation of getting
out from under Marshall's contract, which has three guaranteed
years at $18 million remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's name has also be mentioned in a possible trade for
New Jersey's Kendall Gill, a swingman whose contract ($5 million)
expires after next season. The salary numbers would work under the
cap without a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about trade talks with other teams, St. Jean replied
cryptically: ``I'd say they have been fruitful, but they're not
especially ripe yet.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a growing feeling that beyond Steve Francis _ possibly
the draft's top selection _ and Davis, the Warriors were not that
enthused about the other three point guards deemed worthy of
lottery selections _ Andre Miller, Jason Terry and Avery.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the team is concerned about their ability to come
in and make a difference right away, especially at a position of
such responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quantity, but there's lots of youth,'' assistant GM
Gary Fitzsimmons said of the point guards in the draft. ``Even with
the senior point guards, other than Andre Miller, you have guys who
have played lots at the scoring position and are relatively young
as far as being a point guard is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Warriors would like to pry free agent Terrell Brandon _
whom Fitzsimmons knows well from their days in Cleveland _ in a
sign-and-trade with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves reportedly also have talked to Portland about a
swap of Brandon for disenchanted Damon Stoudamire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dreaming if you think you're going to wind up with
Brandon,'' said a league source, ``unless you can give up something
extraordinary, and the Warriors don't have anybody extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they would if they could land Jonathan Bender, the
6-foot-10 high schooler from Mississippi whose draft stock seems to
be rising. The Warriors were impressed with his athleticism and
shooting ability when they had him in for a workout and project him
to be taken between the fifth and 16th picks.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons has long preached the value of drafting the best
player available, regardless of the team's needs, so this could be
a test of that theory. Ideally, the Warriors would like to move
into a better drafting spot and put themselves in position to
choose the best player available and also fit a need at point
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would tell a fan who queried him about whether the
team will stay at No. 10, St. Jean went into GM mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, `I can't hear you,''' he replied. ```I've got wax in
ears.'''

WILD, WILD WILL: RIDING SHOTGUN WITH THE FASTEST MOUTH IN THE
`WEST' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trims) 
 
By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Will Smith is striding around the room,
demonstrating what he liked about playing Jim West in ``Wild Wild
West.''
</P>
<P>
   The tight pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Western thing and the clothes and the tight pants,''
he says. ``Those pants were so tight because Robert Conrad (who
played Jim West on television) always had them tight. That's how he
could walk so straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith goes on strutting around the hotel room, laughing and
exuberantly showing the effect of tight pants. He's having a great
time.
</P>
<P>
   Talking with Smith, star of two of the Top 10 movie moneymakers
of all time (``Independence Day'' and ``Men in Black''), is like
chatting with a happy electric generator. The minute he walks into
the room, the energy needle starts banging against overload.
</P>
<P>
   His conversational volume is at least three times higher than
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a cup of coffee this morning,'' he explains. ``I rarely
take any aspirin or anything like that. If I would be a little
saggy on the set, (director) Barry (Sonnenfeld) would give me a
cappuccino. The slightest sip of caffeine or sugar takes me way
over the top. We were calling it crack-accino.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith exudes life force from every pore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not just turning that (personality) on for you; that is
who he is,'' says Sonnenfeld, who also directed Smith in ``Men in
Black.'' ``Occasionally when I'm depressed, I'll call Will or see
him. He's almost like my religious adviser. He'll walk me through
my life and remind me why I should be so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Smith's ``Wild Wild West'' cohorts _ Kevin Kline, Salma
Hayek, Kenneth Branagh _ tell the same story: Smith is always
happy, always energetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fantastic,'' Hayek says. ``He's always, always in a good
mood. Weird. Always singing. Extremely generous, like, really
generous. Funny. Great heart. Talented. Focused. Very professional.
Down-to-earth.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's Smith's pal Sonnenfeld who plays head cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this sounds like I'm blowing smoke, but when Will's
around, you're just in a good mood,'' says Sonnenfeld, who is an
outrageous character himself. ``You won't know why you've suddenly
gotten in a better mood, and you realize Will has silently come
onto the stage. He has that karmic thing about him. He has an
aura.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Men in Black,'' Sonnenfeld swore he wouldn't do any more
big special-effects movies. Then he got the script for ``Wild Wild
West,'' a big summer roller-coaster version of the 1965-'70 TV
series about a secret agent in the post-Civil War West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Warner Bros. I would do it if I could do it with
Will,'' Sonnenfeld says. ``By using Will, I could put a spin on it
and make it different and hip and cool, in the same way Robert
Conrad was in 1967.''
</P>
<P>
   So Sonnenfeld sent Smith the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry said, `I'm sending you a script that you have to do, so
you don't need to read it 'cause you're doing it anyway,''' Smith
says.
</P>
<P>
   But he did read it and had a few questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Barry, have you ever seen the television show? Um,
did you notice any subtle differences between myself and Robert
Conrad?' Barry said, `Oh, yeah, he's a little shorter than you, but
don't worry about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Smith wears an updated variation of the absurd
pseudo-Western outfit Conrad wore in the series: short black
jacket; fancy vest; rakish, wide-brimmed hat; and, of course, those
dark, tight pants.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at the Four Seasons Hotel, he's sporting a casual white
suit with zipper pockets and zipper front. It looks suspiciously
like an infamous leisure suit, but he flashes open the jacket to
reveal the label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't nothin' but Gianni (Versace), baby,'' he says with a big
grin.
</P>
<P>
   His black belt has a silver Armani buckle. He's wearing a white,
ribbed tank-top undershirt, so it's easy to see his substantial
silver chain necklace. The shoes are heavy and black.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's hair is cut short, and it looks like he hasn't shaved,
on purpose, in four days. There are no rings or bracelets.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 30, is married to actress Jada Pinkett Smith. He has two
sons, Jaden, 1, and Trey (Willard III), 6, from Smith's first
marriage. Last year the family bought a 100-acre ranch in the
Malibu-Santa Monica mountains for a reported $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was a fan of ``Wild Wild West'' from watching reruns, but,
on the whole, he wasn't big on Westerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there weren't a lot of black folks in the American
Western,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   How about Woody Strode (``The Professionals'')?
</P>
<P>
   ``There you go,'' he says. ``That's one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The picture of what a cowboy is in America has always been John
Wayne, so to me, it feels great to now give the opportunity to
young black kids, who will now see Will Smith as a cowboy. That
will be their memory of Westerns.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A black Secret Service cowboy may be nontraditional, but ``Wild
Wild West'' is anything but traditional. Like the original TV
series, it's as much science-fiction as Western, as much comedy as
action. We're talking about a Western in which the villain has
tanks and 200-foot-tall mechanical spiders at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Kline plays West's sidekick-partner, Artemus Gordon (played on
TV by the late Ross Martin). Branagh is Dr. Arliss Loveless, a
character based on evil scientist Dr. Miguelito Loveless, played on
TV by Michael Dunn. This Loveless is not a dwarf, as the late Dunn
was; he has lost both legs and travels around in a motorized
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the cast, for no reason except to give West and Gordon a
woman to pursue, is Hayek.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference from the original is the budget. Rumors have
had the film going way over its $105 million budget, though
Sonnenfeld and Smith both deny it spiraled anywhere near the $200
million that some publications have reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people who were already hating the movie,'' Smith
says. ``In the rap world, we call them player haters. Maybe the
whole July 4 thing, for some reason (they thought we) needed to be
smacked down a little bit. It's time for Will Smith to get knocked
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``July 4 thing'' refers to Smith's record of success on that
holiday. Both ``Independence Day'' (1996) and ``Men in Black''
(1997) were Fourth of July mega-hits. Now ``Wild Wild West'' is
trying to repeat the success for the third time in four years by
opening Wednesday for an extended July 4 weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Smith wasn't the first to refer to ``Big Willie Weekend,'' but
he admits he loves the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the spectacle and saying it's Big Willie Weekend, the
music video and all of that. Big Willie Weekend is part of being
American now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's only fair to add that Smith says things like that with a
big grin and a self-deprecating air. He has a healthy ego, but he
also seems to have a sense of who he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will is never going to change, he just isn't,'' Sonnenfeld
says. ``At the age of 16, he had a hit record and was a
millionaire. He moved out of his home, into a mansion and had six
cars. At the age of 17, his second record didn't do any business.
He got into tax trouble, moved back home, sold the mansion, the
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Will's seen major success and major failure early in his
life. And also his relationship to his parents grounded him and
made him into a godlike figure in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that period in his life, Smith pauses for just a
split second, a long time for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got arrogant. I felt like whatever I put out was going to
work,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's been a big part of why I've been successful: my
work ethic and my focus and my obsessive behavior and perfectionist
attitude. It happened in music. I had a chance to be successful and
have money and then lose it, and then work hard and get it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was in the military, so I was raised with a
hard-core military background. Anytime you get away from working
hard and focusing, you have to expect that something's not going to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much better to be broke and make money than to have
money and lose it. There was a time I had a mansion and six cars
and three motorcycles, but didn't have money to put gas in the
cars. I would say I was broke. People would say `No, you're
rich-people broke.' I'd say, `No, no, no, I was regular-folks
broke.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me so appreciative of the opportunities that I don't
want to do anything to mess up the position.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There have been accusations that his reluctance to risk his
position has made Smith too careful. Some critics have called his
rap music too homogenized. His acting choices have been for
unchallenging roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always dealt with it in the music,'' he says. ``I've
always had (detractors). I've always been soft or popcorn or not
real rap. My skin is hard in the music. But in film, this is the
first time I've dealt with potshots.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been criticized about his films and acting before, but
``that's after they've seen the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   He says some people began attacking ``Wild Wild West'' before
they had seen it, spreading rumors that the extensive reshooting
completed after test screenings was a sign the movie was not good.
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenfeld and Smith counter by saying that many films are
reworked after test screenings,which allow filmmakers to see what
works with an audience and what doesn't. Perfectly true, although
there is seldom as much reshooting as there was on ``Wild Wild
West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone that makes movies would love to watch the movie and
then go back and say, `Oh, God, I wish I had said it this way,'''
Smith says. ``And go back and redo it and make it funnier or more
emotional or different.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Reshooting) was getting that sexy, funny, cool balance. We
took a little of the gunplay out. This was just a bad summer for
gunplay,'' he says, referring to all the violence in the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Willie Weekend was funny last year. To some people, it's
less funny this year. I feel a sense that some people (think), `Let
this guy get a little knock-down here. He's a little high on his
`Wild Wild West' horse.'
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) kind of hurt my feelings a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The comedy, which was an important but small part of the TV
series, is also a lot bigger in the new ``Wild Wild West.'' And
edgier. Sonnenfeld played off Smith's blackness for a lot of risky
humor, such as an outrageous scene in which West tries to joke
racists out of lynching him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out on a limb a little bit with the political
correctness,'' Smith says. ``It might be a little over the edge for
some people, but to the people that get it, it's really funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Before filming began, Smith read a quote by Conrad reminding
people he did most of his own stunts in the original action-packed
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now, I'm trying to do all my own stunts,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, West is on a small rail car that goes underneath a
train, and then slides backward under another train following.
Smith found that pretty scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a real train, and we were on train tracks. The train
was probably doing 45 or 50mph, and I have to be whipping through
at 60 mph and getting snatched back. I'm under there trying to
figure out why the hell did I let Robert Conrad make me do this,''
he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also had to learn to ride a horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never been on a horse in my life. So for six weeks I'm
crunching, trying to learn to ride. We were working in Santa Fe
(N.M.), so I was riding a horse back and forth to work. I was
getting a good 10 miles in a day.''
</P>
<P>
   So far Smith has no horses on his ranch, just lots of dogs, but
he's planning to change that since he has learned to ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like being on a horse. That's such an amazing
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith is an agreeable interview, but he's also in control. If
the conversation gets a little serious, he has a way of gracefully
steering it in the direction he wants. Asked what he learned as an
actor on this film _ perhaps a silly question considering the
film's silly nature _ he turns it into a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just learned that I have a really, really great (rear
end),'' he says without missing a beat. ``It's just really fun,
it's generous, it's caring. It's one of those, when you see it,
because I was naked in the first scene, it's just saying to you,
`Hey, pal, how are you doing?' You know?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``Wild Wild West'' is a flop or the third Big Willie
Weekend, Smith plans no more big summer movies for awhile. He wants
to concentrate on smaller or more serious roles to create a
platform for his career, even if he is already one of the
highest-paid actors out there.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Late this year he plans to start a Muhammad Ali biopic, again
working with Sonnenfeld. He plans six months of training before the
film, which will probably cover Ali's life from the Olympics to his
long boxing career. He is also meeting with Nicolas Cage to discuss
a comedy script about two heterosexual firemen who decide to
secretly marry in Hawaii, where same-sex marriages are allowed, to
ensure benefits for their children should they be killed on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a film called ``The Mark,'' another
blockbuster-type movie Smith is considering doing with the
``Independence Day'' producers, but not for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   And waiting out there, maybe, is a ``Men in Black'' sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry and I haven't signed for it. We kind of agreed not to do
any sequels,'' he says. ``But you know, the studios can be
persuasive.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, anything is possible. Smith has even been quoted as
saying he thought he could get elected president, if he set his
mind to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I was saying that kind of half-joking,'' he says.
``But I really feel like I could. ... You know?''

HARRY POTTER IS BACK IN SECOND ADVENTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JANE P. MARSHALL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alice and Lewis Carroll. Willy Wonka and Roald Dahl. Peter Pan
and J.M. Barrie. And now Harry Potter and J.K. Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   When Rowling scratched out Harry Potter's first adventures on a
chunk of paper in a cafe, did she dream her mind-child would join
Alice, Willy and Peter Pan as a household name?
</P>
<P>
   Did she imagine herself never fretting again about the grocery
bill? Did she think of making Entertainment Weekly's It List for
1999? Did she realize that peace and quiet would fly out the window
faster than Harry on his Nimbus 2000 broom?
</P>
<P>
   Rowling's first adventure of the 11-year-old Potter zoomed to
the New York Times best-seller list faster than the Snitch in a
game of Quidditch at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's stories propel at the same speed. No long descriptions
or subtle philosophy here. Harry moves faster than a video game
character, gets in more fixes than Mario ever dreamed of and faces
menaces who would make Darth Mahl seem like a puppy.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``The Hobbit'' meets ``Goosebumps.'' Children's books will
never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter'' and the ``Sorcerer's Stone'' has been on the
national best-seller list for more than six months, a statistic
unheard of in children's literature. It is still there.
</P>
<P>
   Now, rushed three months ahead of schedule into American
bookstores, ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''
(Scholastic, $17.95) elicits as many squeaks of delight and late
nights of reading as Book No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure No. 3, ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,''
should be in bookstores in September. Rowling plans seven Potter
books. Film rights to the first two have been optioned by Warner
Brothers. Is that a good thing?
</P>
<P>
   The series retains its delight and speed, with more creative
characters than George Lucas' cantina scene in ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many of the longest-lasting children's stories, ``Harry
Potter'' isn't mired in morals. In decades to come no scholar will
likely analyze Rowling's motives and undercurrents.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Sorcerer's Stone,'' ``Chamber of Secrets'' is just plain
fun. It's packed with what kids can relate to: sports competition,
too much homework, mean classmates, strict teachers and rules that
beg breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, one of the rules is that underage student wizards cannot
use their magic outside the classroom. Sure, their teachers lord
over classes such as Herbology, Defense Against the Dark Arts and
Transfiguration.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, now 12 and in his second year at Hogwarts, is a hero,
known throughout the wizard world because of how he got the tiny
scar on his forehead. He's whole-blood, meaning both his parents
were wizards. Most of us are Mudbloods, and our parents are
Muggles, people without magic powers.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to play Quidditch (a team sport executed on magic
brooms) and deal with the traumas and joys of school. Traumas focus
on a ghost in a girls bathroom, the magic chamber, monstrous
creatures, a book with no writing and a devious plot.
</P>
<P>
   Harry and his friends unravel the mystery in P.D. Jameslike
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling builds a parallel universe. Wizards have to deal with
the Muggles world, but Muggles only suspect the magic world.
</P>
<P>
   Complex? You bet. Otherwise kids would turn on the TV. Original?
Yes. Here, as an example, is a bit of Rowling vocabulary:
</P>
<P>
   Skele-Grow _ a potion to grow bones back when a spell has taken
them away.
</P>
<P>
   Aparecium _ the magic word that makes invisible ink visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spellotape _ used to mend a magic wand.
</P>
<P>
   Parseltongue _ the ability to speak to snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Peskipiksi pesternomi _ this spell does not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry'' ranks near the top of a read-aloud family project. But
don't expect a wind-down sleepy-time moment.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the magical read-aloud category is Mercer Mayer's new
``Shibumi and the Kitemaker'' (Marshall Cavendish, $18.95). Mayer's
classics reach back years and include such wonders as ``Professor
Wormbog in Search for the Zipperump-A-Zoo'' and ``A Book, A Dog and
a Frog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shibumi'' is a different path for Mayer.
</P>
<P>
   First, he creates the entrancing art for this picture book in
Adobe Photoshop, ElectricImage, FormZ, Bryce, Painter, Adobe
Illustrator and Tree Professional computer programs.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he sets the fablelike story in Japan. Mayer writes that
he has been enthralled by Japanese culture since he was a child.
``As familiar as I have been with the Japanese culture, I never
felt as though I could penetrate it, being a foreigner.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``I first heard the word `shibumi' on that trip to
Japan. I loved the way it sounded, but no one could translate it
for me except to say it meant something fashionable or in good
taste. Later on I gave it a meaning of my own, and out of that grew
the story. As far as I know it has no basis in Japanese folk
literature. `Shibumi' takes place in a culture that might have
been, or in a place that exists even now _ certainly in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   His profound and heartfelt words echo through the pages as he
spins the tale of a princess who is protected from ugliness until
one day she climbs a tree and looks over the palace wall. The shock
sets her on a fateful path that, with the help of the royal kite
maker, tests her convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Change is possible, but not without pain.
</P>
<P>
   Summer magic is best epitomized by a movie _ ``Episode I: The
Phantom Menace.'' Not everybody is sick of the ubiquitous ``Star
Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Some like wearing ``Star Wars'' clothes, sleeping on ``Star
Wars'' sheets, drinking from Star Wars Pepsi cups and reading
``Star Wars books.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenom wouldn't be complete without ``Star Wars _ Episode I:
The Visual Dictionary'' (DK, $19.95) or ``Incredible
Cross-Sections'' (DK, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologist David West Reynolds, a ``Star Wars'' nut himself,
approached his task the way he would a study of ancient Rome or
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   With artists Hans Jenssen and Richard Chasemore, he describes
the guts of spacecraft such as the Naboo N-1 Starfighter and the
Sith Infiltrator, and places them in the galaxy with their
functions and histories. You've probably wondered where the array
of 16 droid signal-receiver stations were located on the Droid
Starfighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Visual Dictionary'' is even better. Take a close look at
Sebulba's blue-skinned groomers. Stop and study characters that are
on screen only seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Astound your friends with your knowledge of ``Star Wars''
trivia: the scar of remembrance that divides Queen Amidala's lip,
the parts of Maul's lightsaber, the members of the Jedi High
Council.
</P>
<P>
   In the long list of small-type acknowledgments, Reynolds writes:
``FBI Special Agent R. Matthew Bliss offered the benefit of his
expertise in refining the secret profile of Darth Maul, marking
what was probably the first time a U.S. federal agent has
professionally explored the background of a Sith Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderful, magical summer. Enjoy it with books.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ The hectic pace was nothing new for the former
waitress.
</P>
<P>
   It would take time, though, for Resa Kelly to get used to the
rocking and rolling of this dining room _ a Boeing 757.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the upside-down world of what I do,'' says the Houston
chef, grabbing the lobster tail with du Barry sauce from the flight
attendant and scuttling down the aisle to deliver the appetizer to
the passenger in seat 4F.
</P>
<P>
   Returning for another plate, Kelly is thrown off-balance by the
turbulence that would cause flight attendants and passengers to
feel like tossed salads at the end of the day. In the galley,
several unwrapped food trays shot out of the storage cart like
aluminum rocket ships. Glasses of water turned over, causing a
minor flood at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like working in a kitchen during an earthquake,'' says
Kelly, the owner of Resa's Prime Steak and Piano Bar in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old restaurateur was recently added to the roster of
notable chefs enlisted by Continental Airlines to redesign and
revamp its food.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly joins celebrity chefs Michael Cordua of Americas and
Churrascos in Houston, Don Pintabona of Tribeca Grill in New York
City and Roy Yamaguchi of Roy's restaurants worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And like them, she will serve as the in-flight chef on several
of the airline's transcontinental and international flights
throughout the year, trying to get a better understanding of the
food service on board an aircraft 35,000 feet above ground.
</P>
<P>
   She will then apply the information to develop menus for the
airline's business, first-class and, eventually, coach cabins.
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds like a restaurant with wings, that is exactly
the point, and Houston-based Continental is the first to admit that
the Chef on Board program is a great publicity tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a learning opportunity for the chefs; but it's also great
PR for us to show customers that there's a lot of thought put into
our food,'' says Siegfried Lang, managing director of food and
beverage planning.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly signed up for the 6:45 p.m. flight from Newark, N.J., to
San Francisco. Standing inside the 5-by-6-foot galley, the mother
of three struggles to unwrap the layers of plastic wrap around the
plates of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to suggest that they start using plastic covers.
It'll be easier for the flight attendants to remove,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Continental's transcontinental business and first-class
passengers dine on menus designed by the celebrity chefs. The
five-course meal on this flight was created by Pintabona, executive
chef of Tribeca Grill. It features selections such as a mixed grill
of veal, lamb and beef; macadamia-crusted salmon; breast of duck;
and spinach ravioli with Alfredo sauce.
</P>
<P>
   As flight attendant Steve Miller transfers the entrees to the
plates, Kelly helps with the presentation, adding a few fine-dining
touches by artfully crossing the asparagus and drizzling sauces
around the vegetables _ an attention to detail that may seem
revolutionary. But Continental isn't the only airline trying to
transpose cabin dining into fine dining; its competitors have also
jumped on board.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, United Airlines convinced internationally
celebrated chef Jacques Pepin to bring his cooking on board
selected domestic flights. But already on the Chicago-based
airline's payroll are such familiar faces as Martin Yan of PBS-TV's
``Yan Can Cook'' series and Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger of
the Food Network's ``Too Hot Tamales'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's not going to be a restaurant per se. We just want
to emulate some of its features and to bring a fine-dining
experience along with the long-haul air experience,'' says Bob
Braden, United Airlines's manager for on-board service planning for
North America.
</P>
<P>
   To get an edge on competitors, it seems, airline executives are
banking on better food _ this after years of slashing in-flight
meals and snacks to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's greater competition among the carriers in the total
perception of the product by customers. Food is a big part of
that,'' explains Lynda Zane, senior director of dining services for
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly joins a long list of culinary luminaries upgrading and
updating airline food, including Paul Prudhomme for American
Airlines, Michel Roux for British Airways and Raymond Blanc for
Virgin Atlantic. But not every flier will sample creations by the
celebrity chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the celebrity chefs are involved in first-class or
international meals. Celebrity chefs don't seem to touch much on
the rest of the passengers,'' says Randy Petersen, editor and
publisher of InsideFlyer magazine and an expert on frequent-flier
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity chefs have been around for 20 years. None of them
has made any long-lasting impression on what airline food is today.
It will never, ever change.''
</P>
<P>
   Most industry watchers agree that airline food is often driven
by economics. Right now, the airlines are flying high financially _
hence the attempt to upgrade the food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can all imagine that if the industry isn't doing well,
we'll all be back to peanuts,'' Petersen says.
</P>
<P>
   While the first-class passengers on this Continental flight
munch on duck, veal and lamb, those in the coach cabin are chewing
on chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starving. I haven't eaten since 10:30 this morning,''
says Mark Tolanel of New Jersey, looking down at his empty tray in
coach. ``It was really just mediocre. But the food, at least, comes
to you warmer than it used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Michael Hales, 26, is finishing off his bean-and-rice
burrito.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they had better desserts. Just because we're
vegetarians doesn't mean we don't like fatty, creamy-filled foods.
This is no fun,'' he complains, waving a small cinnamon twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I got this stuff on the ground, I would never go back to
the restaurant,'' girlfriend Joanna Brief adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're being too critical, especially since the food is
complimentary,'' Hales says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Complimentary?'' Brief replies. ``You're paying for it!''
</P>
<P>
   On average, airlines spend $2-$4 per person on domestic flights,
according to industry insiders. International flights range from
$30 to $50 per person per flight, because airlines serve more
elaborate meals and free alcohol on longer hauls.
</P>
<P>
   Continental will spend about $250 million this year on in-flight
food service. The air carrier serves up about 80,000 meals daily.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly can grill a mean steak at her restaurant in Houston. But
up in the air, she does little cooking since the meals are already
prepared and partly cooked in one of the airline's six Chelsea
Catering kitchens around the country. Her job on board is to simply
switch on the convection oven, which will reheat the food at 350
degrees for 15 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't from the kitchen to the table. It has to go through
two other steps to get to your plate,'' Kelly says. ``It's a real
challenge coming up with dishes that will withstand all those
steps. But it's just a matter of picking out things that will
translate well.''
</P>
<P>
   What Kelly hopes will work are her bread soup bowls, which
Continental will introduce in a couple of months. What she's
certain won't work are dishes such as poached eggs, risottos and
souffles.

CATHOLIC CHURCH'S PROCLAMATION LEADS MOSTLY TO PAPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Six months after U.S. bishops called for closer
ties between Catholic colleges and the Vatican, the proclamation's
most visible legacy is paper _ lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pile on `Ex corde' is 7 inches thick,'' said Mark Sullivan,
president of the College of Saint Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The paper trail is testament to the substantial confusion
surrounding a papal document called ``Ex corde Ecclesiae,'' or
``From the Heart of the Church.''
</P>
<P>
   From the day U.S. bishops responded to the document last
November, it threatened to rock the precarious balance at Catholic
colleges between maintaining high academic standards and a uniquely
Catholic identity.
</P>
<P>
   Professors blanched at medieval-sounding proposals that seemed
aimed at their academic freedom: Schools would appoint ``faithful''
Catholics as professors and trustees. New presidents would make an
``oath of fidelity'' to the church. And the local bishop would
judge whether a theologian's teaching accurately portrayed church
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about 20th century American faculty taking a
loyalty oath,'' said Raymond Boisvert, a professor of philosophy at
Siena College. ``There'd be a revolt.''
</P>
<P>
   Administrators worry that the interpretation would make
non-Catholic students and faculty feel like second-class citizens,
and that federal aid requiring a clear separation of church and
state would dry up.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, millions of dollars in so-called ``Bundy aid'' to
Catholic colleges hinges on the understanding that they are not
``under the control and direction of any religious denomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Others fear discrimination lawsuits and losing the
seal-of-approval of non-religious accrediting bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Since most Catholic colleges receive little or no money from the
church, the worst penalty they could face if they don't comply is
to lose their right to call themselves ``Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Albany region, the three main Catholic Colleges _ Maria
and St. Rose in Albany, and Siena in Colonie _ have reacted
cautiously to the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, St. Rose will hold a retreat on ``Ex corde''
featuring Sullivan and members of the college's board of trustees.
The Rev. Kevin Mackin, president of Siena, has embraced a
substantially watered-down proposal offered last month by the
Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the references to loyalty oaths and mandates for
majority-Catholic faculties. Instead, the alternative asks colleges
to make ``all reasonable efforts'' to find professors who are
``committed to maintaining the specific Catholic identity of the
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Many faculty interviewed recently said they were unaware or
unphased by the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't affect me personally, and I don't think in a
million years it will happen,'' said Peter Zaas, a Jewish professor
at Siena who teaches New Testament theology.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying much of the discussion, however, is a subtler debate
about the direction of the nation's Catholic schools at the turn of
the millennium: Just how Catholic are they?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any bishop has the time or the energy to run a
college,'' said Bishop Howard Hubbard of Albany. ``But I think it
is the will of bishops and college administrators that
secularization doesn't erode our Catholic colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Harvard, Duke and Yale all started as Protestant
institutions but are now seen as non-religious.
</P>
<P>
   The tug-of-war between Catholic schools and the Vatican is as
old as the university itself. It dates to the 13th century, when
Thomas Aquinas ran afoul of church authorities for mixing biblical
theology with the teachings of Aristotle at the University of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In this century, the debate came into sharper focus following
the Second Vatican Council, which promoted a freer church spirit.
Colleges that had been exclusively controlled by the clergy saw an
increasing reliance on laymen.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that Catholic colleges became less of a training
ground for future religious leaders. A recent survey by the
Official Catholic Directory found that there were 40 percent fewer
priests in the nation than there were just 30 years ago, at a time
when the Catholic population has risen by 15 million. Some believe
those statistics are a key reason the Vatican is looking to bring
the nation's Catholic universities closer to the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when 2 out of 3 graduates at St. Rose went on
to holy orders, and Siena almost had a quota on numbers who went
into the priesthood,'' said Bruce Johnston, chair of the department
of religion and philosophy at St. Rose. ``Now, we have a situation
in the region where parishes are served by lay people because there
aren't enough priests around.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has sought to re-assert the church's influence
and step back from Vatican II. He has hunkered down on
controversial social issues like homosexuality and abortion.

BIDIS GAIN FAVOR WITH NATION'S TEENAGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD FITZPATRICK  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Sitting on a bicycle outside Albany High School,
the 16-year-old student unfolded his wallet and plucked out one of
the thin, flavored cigarettes that are gaining popularity among
teenagers in the Albany area.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-rolled, unfiltered butts _ called bidis, or beedies _
release two or three times the nicotine and tar of regular
cigarettes. Yet many people, including this teenager, think they
are cleaner than the average smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Most people over 30 wouldn't know a bidi from a Beanie Baby. But
the scent of the tiny cigarettes is wafting over hip teen hangouts
from Boston's Harvard Square to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury, and
Albany teens are becoming part of the trend, according to merchants
and anti-smoking activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very popular,'' said Erin Wisnewski, substance abuse
prevention specialist at the LaSalle School for Boys in Albany.
``All of the kids are smoking them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidis have all the trappings of a true teen fad. They look like
joints, so they have a rebellious quality. They are made in India,
so some consider them exotic. And they come in flavors _ vanilla
and chocolate, cherry and strawberry, cardamom and clove.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, they can be lethal. Yet some people are smoking them
with the idea that they are less harmful than regular cigarettes.
``There's not as much addictive stuff,'' the boy on the bike, who
asked to remain anonymous, said as he lit a bidi and handed another
to his buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Such misconceptions are alarming to anti-smoking activists, who
see bidis as a candy-coated ploy to get young people to begin
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flavor makes them exciting and makes them the current
trend,'' said Jill Fenton, program director for the American Lung
Association of Northeastern New York, based in Colonie.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, kids ate candy cigarettes. Now, Fenton said,
``They're enticing children with candy-flavored real cigarettes
that have the same real drug and the same real cancer-causing
agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenton said the problem with underage smoking is already bad,
with the average smoker taking that first drag at age 13, and 90
percent starting before they turn 18. Bidis can only make matters
worse, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers interviewed for this story said taste is one of the
main reasons they smoke bidis.
</P>
<P>
   One 17-year-old from Albany said he smoked his first bidi at age
13, before he had ever touched a regular cigarette. ``They don't
taste that bad,'' the boy said of bidis as he sat at the Cafe Dolce
coffeeshop, cracking open a package of regular cigarettes. ``Cherry
is good.'' ``Vanilla is best,'' said his friend, a 17-year-old
girl, also from Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Bidis have been sold in the United States for decades. At first,
they were popular only with natives of India or other parts of
Asia, but in the past couple of years they have become fashionable
with a larger population in the United States, France and England,
said Dr. Samira Asma, an epidemiologist with the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Bidis are becoming more common and popular in convenience stores
and tobacco shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sell very well for a boutique or deluxe cigarette,'' said
Dick Adair, regional director of Smokers' Paradise, which has nine
stores in the Albany region. ``There is definitely a following.''
</P>
<P>
   In India, that following is an older crowd. But in the United
States, the devotees are decidedly young. ``No one over 30 knows
what they are,'' Adair said.
</P>
<P>
   New York State law prohibits the sale of tobacco products,
including bidis, to people younger than 18. But kids say it's easy
to get bidis, and they are buying them.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the taste, observers say there are a number of reasons
why the smokes are catching on despite their danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's regarded as something very hip, ethnic, exotic,'' Asma
said. Indian culture is weaving its way into American music and
fashion, and bidis are becoming as trendy as the toe ring, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people like that they have a homemade quality to
them,'' said Dan Heins, owner of the Shining Star incense shop. The
store does not sell bidis but often has customers asking for the
cigarettes, which are hand-rolled and tied with a string. ``It kind
of has a Third Worldish, cottage-industry feel to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It also has the look and smell of smoking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like you are doing a criminal act when you are just
smoking a bidi,'' Heins said. ``You can't get in trouble for it,
and you don't walk around stoned all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking activists say bidis play into a new marketing
gimmick, tried by the Winston brand, that emphasizes the lack of
additives in some cigarettes. Also, bidis are smaller than regular
cigarettes and contain less tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, bidis are more hazardous than your basic butt,
releasing two or three times more tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide
and other cancer-causing agents, Asma said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're terribly dangerous,'' said Russell Sciandra, director
of the Center for a Tobacco Free new York, based in Albany. ``They
are unfiltered, full of carcinogens. They're a very dirty smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, bidis are beginning to make it onto the radar screen of
lawmakers. Earlier this month, Arizona became the first state to
enact legislation banning the sale and distribution of the tiny
cigarettes. The impetus was concern about how popular bidis were
becoming among young people, Asma said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to bidis, Asma said, the message for teens is
simple: ``It's not as cool as it appears to be. They are really
deadly.''

<P>
   Q: Are bidis safer than regular cigarettes?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bidis consist of thin, sun-dried flakes or strands of tobacco
wrapped up in the leaf of the tendu plant. Despite containing less
tobacco than a U.S. cigarette, an unfiltered bidi releases at least
two to three times more tar and nicotine. The tendu leaves are not
porous, which means the smoker must inhale often and deeply to keep
them lit, resulting in the absorption of especially large
quantities of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide. This inhalation
may result in increased chance of smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are clove cigarettes safer than regular cigarettes?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clove cigarettes, imported from Indonesia, contain 60 percent
to 70 percent tobacco and 30 percent to 40 percent ground cloves,
clove oil and other additives. Clove cigarettes have nicotine, tar
and carbon monoxide yields that are twice as high as moderate-tar
cigarettes. Users of clove cigarettes have reported ailments
ranging from nosebleeds to asthma attacks. Clove cigarettes contain
eugenol, which numbs the throat and suppresses the cough reflex.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are additive-free cigarettes safer than regular cigarettes?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Removing the additives from cigarettes does not remove the
nicotine, the tars or any of the other constituents of tobacco,''
said Dudley Hafner, chief executive officers of the American Heart
Association. ``Burning tobacco and ingesting it into the lungs is
responsible for the deaths of more than 400,000 Americans each
year. With or without additives, cigarettes can hurt you.''

BILL PULLMAN AND THE CROC OF DOOM

 (Includes a color slide of Bill Pullman with Brendan Gleeson in a
scene from ``Lake Placid.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Lions and tigers and bears, oh my.
 &HT;    Bill Pullman was in the wilds of Vancouver, British Columbia,
roughing it with the cast of an upcoming movie in which he plays a
macho game warden, but there's a big difference between acting and
being.
 &HT;    ``Listen, Bill,'' the forest-ranger liaison told him, ``when it
gets dark, for God's sake do not venture out of your campgrounds.
There have been bear attacks in the area.''
 &HT;    So picture the reaction of Bridget Fonda, his co-star in ``Lake
Placid,'' when Pullman announced around midnight that he was going
for a walk to pick blackberries.
 &HT;    ``I was screaming, `Bill, don't go! The bears!''' Fonda recalls.
``You see, I panic for other people. But Bill gets this glint in
his eye and says, `I'll be back with dessert.'''
 &HT;    Pullman says he didn't actually think much of it.
 &HT;    ``I didn't take the ranger seriously at all. Modern society has
gotten us all a little neurotic,'' the actor says. ``I figured if I
made a little noise going into the woods, then the bear would leave
me alone or ask for an autograph.''
 &HT;    But once he was alone in the forest ...
 &HT;    ``I guess nerves did take over,'' he says. ``By the end of my
walk, I was banging so many sticks and cups together that I sounded
like a percussion section.''
 &HT;    As he relaxes over a Saturday-morning breakfast at Los Angeles'
Four Seasons Hotel, Pullman doesn't look much like an outdoorsman.
Model-handsome in black slacks and a gray shirt, with overgrown
bangs falling into his face, the 45-year-old actor doesn't look
like he'd have much of an idea of what to do if confronted by a
30-foot-long, man-eating crocodile in the pristine Maine
wilderness.
 &HT;    But that's the setup for ``Lake Placid,'' which opens July 16
nationwide. Pullman's character heads a group of misfits including
a nature-phobic paleontologist (Fonda), an out-of-his-league
sheriff (Brendan Gleeson) and an eccentric mythology professor
(Oliver Platt) who must somehow capture or kill the deadly
creature.
 &HT;    His advisors urged him not to sign on to what is essentially an
inland ``Jaws,'' Pullman says. But he liked the script, written by
David E. Kelley, creator of ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal.''
And besides, he had another, less typical reason for making the
movie.
 &HT;    ``Secretly, I wanted to do it for my brother,'' Pullman says.
``When we were growing up, our hero was a forest ranger from
upstate New York named Art Flick, who wrote for Field and Stream.
He had a patch on his sleeve and the coolest truck just loaded with
gear. We wanted to be Flick.
 &HT;    ``I knew if I did this movie and played a ranger, my brother
would be so jealous,'' he adds with a wicked laugh. ``He's only a
doctor. I could be a ranger!''
 &HT;    Other than squaring off against some pretty ugly aliens in
``Independence Day'' (1996), Pullman didn't have much experience
with monster movies. His typical roles as good-guy leading men in
such films as ``Sleepless in Seattle'' (1993), ``Malice'' (1993)
and ``While You Were Sleeping'' (1996) weren't the kind that lead
an actor to spend weeks in a freezing-cold lake with a huge,
artificial crocodile.
 &HT;    ``The weird thing in the water is that you would notice waves
that were not being made by our effects crew,'' Pullman says. ``All
of a sudden, a huge beaver would swim by you.
 &HT;    ``Beavers do not respect actors.''
 &HT;    At other times, he recalls, his own imagination was his worst
enemy.
 &HT;    ``You're psyched up to do a horror movie, and all of a sudden in
the lake, something with tentacles grabs at your feet,'' he says.
``You jump, and then blush when you realize it's only a big weed.''
 &HT;    It's a strange way to make a living, especially for a boy from
Hornell, N.Y., who's the son of a doctor father and a nurse mother,
and whose four siblings who are all in the medical profession.
 &HT;    Given this background, he says, his parents were ``horrified''
when their youngest son, a National Merit Scholarship winner,
decided to forgo medical school in favor of a two-year vocational
school for building construction.
 &HT;    ``At school I think I gave the plumbing students an inferiority
complex,'' Pullman says.
 &HT;    He wanted to go into urban planning _ until a teacher at the
vocational school insisted he join their drama club.
 &HT;    ``Yes, they had a drama program,'' Pullman says. ``One day I
showed up for auditions with some refrigeration students.''
 &HT;    Something clicked, and Pullman abandoned technical school for
drama, earning a master's degree in directing from the University
of Massachusetts at Amherst. He subsequently produced plays and
taught at Montana State University, where he ran the theater
department for two years.
 &HT;    In the 1980s, after a stint studying directing in England,
Pullman moved to New York to pursue an acting career. He was
advised to try the stage, because he wasn't film-star material.
 &HT;    ``I heard, `Your face is not distinctive,''' he says.
 &HT;    Determined to prove otherwise, he moved to Los Angeles, working
at the Los Angeles Theatre Center and angling for movie roles. His
film debut came in ``Ruthless People'' (1986).
 &HT;    Since then, and especially since his breakout role in
``Sleepless in Seattle,'' Pullman has alternated mainstream roles
in films such as ``While You Were Sleeping'' and ``Independence
Day'' with quirkier fare such as ``The Last Seduction'' (1994) and
David Lynch's ``Lost Highway'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``I make strange choices,'' he says, ``because the curse in this
business is when the powers go, `We have this type of role. Get me
a Bill Pullman type.'
 &HT;    ``I think of my type as still evolving,'' Pullman says. ``In
fact, my favorite question from a journalist is `What is your
favorite role?' My answer always will be, `It's a role I haven't
played yet.'''
 &HT;    Not all his roles have been seen, however. Take his role in
director Terrence Malick's long-awaited comeback film, ``The Thin
Red Line'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``It was disappointing,'' Pullman says. ``At one point during
production, Terry thought I should narrate the film. So he sent me
28 single-spaced pages of very complicated dialogue. I worked on it
with him for weeks.''
 &HT;    Then one day Malick called to inform Pullman that he was no
longer the narrator. In fact, he was no longer in the movie at all
_ his role had been cut in its entirety.
 &HT;    ``I guess the people who are actually in the movie should say
the narration,'' Pullman says, shrugging. ``To me every role is a
lark _ I don't let it hurt me.''
 &HT;    Besides, he's too busy to brood. He's currently scouting
Canadian locations for his screen directorial debut, a TNT
adaptation of Owen Wister's classic novel ``The Virginian,'' in
which he will also star.
 &HT;    ``The best part of directing is that I finally feel like an
urban planner,'' Pullman says. ``I'm actually building a Western
town. The other day I found myself saying, `Let's build the school
here.'
 &HT;    ``It's nice how things come full circle.''
 &HT;    As for his career, his viewpoint seems to have been shaped by
his recent wilderness excursion.
 &HT;    ``I think of Hollywood like it's a forest,'' Pullman says.
``Most days I'm swimming through a lake. There are some cold places
in that lake. There are warm places. You just have to keep floating
around, not knowing what will happen next.''

PHIL COLLINS HELPS `TARZAN' SWING

 (Includes a color slide of singer/songwriter Phil Collins.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    This could be big. Really big.
 &HT;    And Phil Collins knows big when he sees it. The British
singer/musician/songwriter/producer _ and occasional actor _ has
released eight multimillion-selling solo albums, plus another
half-dozen during his years with the band Genesis.
 &HT;    But even he's awed by the scale of his latest project, five
songs for the Walt Disney Co.'s new animated feature, ``Tarzan.''
 &HT;    ``It has the potential to be vast _ and I don't necessarily mean
in financial terms, just in terms of the kind of audience it can
reach once these things get on a roll,'' the 48-year-old Collins
says.
 &HT;    ``The music in these films, it's part of movie heritage,'' he
explains. ``You think of the songs almost before you think of the
stories, the old songs like `When You Wish Upon a Star,' `Whistle
While You Work.' The music has always been so integral to those
films. I'm proud to be part of it, actually.''
 &HT;    A big part, really. Collins recorded 10 different versions of
the various songs for the `Tarzan'' soundtrack album, including
separate versions of ``Trashin' the Camp'' with actress Rosie
O'Donnell and with the pop group `N Sync. The album swung into the
Billboard Top 10 during the week following the film's release.
 &HT;    But Collins didn't simply write the songs, as such predecessors
as Howard Ashman/Alan Menken and Tim Rice/Elton John have. He also
sings them in the movie, rather than their being sung by
``Tarzan's'' characters, as in a true musical. Even John sang only
one song in ``The Lion King'' (1994), and that was over the closing
credits.
 &HT;    ``The only other comparable thing was Elton,'' Collins says,
``and his brief was different _ that he write, with Tim Rice, some
songs that would work for the movie. The music was taken and shaken
about a bit and sung by the characters in the film, and he sort of
did the end-credit thing. That's the traditional way it's been.''
 &HT;    Disney wanted a different approach for ``Tarzan,'' which
initially worried Collins.
 &HT;    ``They wanted to break a few molds with this,'' he says. ``I was
a bit apprehensive at first, of people hearing my voice instead of
the characters. For me, that was a worrying issue, but for them, it
wasn't.
 &HT;    ``It obviously makes the film different from anything they've
done before,'' he adds, ``but from my point of view it makes me an
integral part of the movie, which is better than just writing the
songs.''
 &HT;    ``Tarzan'' is only the latest step in the evolution of Collins,
a former child actor who joined Genesis as its drummer in 1970 and
moved out front as its lead singer following Peter Gabriel's
departure in 1975. In 1994 he himself left the group, to
concentrate on his solo career _ though he did participate with the
band in a new recording of their hit ``The Carpet Crawlers'' for a
greatest-hits album, due out this fall.
 &HT;    Since Collins' departure, Genesis has struggled. Founders Tony
Banks and Mike Rutherford replaced Collins with Ray Wilson for
their first album without him, ``Calling All Stations'' (1997).
Fans, particularly American fans, generally criticized the album,
which Collins doesn't mind saying he finds unfair.
 &HT;    ``I mean, all those Genesis fans who have been wringing on over
the last 15 years that I f--ked the band up by taking it and giving
it commercial success, those are the people who should be loving
this band now,'' Collins says. ``I'm not there, and they've got
Tony and Mike, who are basically the spirit of Genesis, writing the
songs ... and they've turned their backs on the band.''
 &HT;    If ``Tarzan'' seems a bit off the beaten track for a longtime
rock star, his other current musical project is even more unusual:
a big band, which he introduced in Switzerland at the 1997 Montreux
Jazz Festival and took on tour in 1998, playing brass-fueled
versions of Genesis favorites, his own solo hits and occasional
covers. In July the band will release a live album, ``A Hot Night
in Paris.''
 &HT;    Collins says the big-band idea was spurred by his desire to
reconnect with drumming after years of fronting Genesis and his
solo band. An invitation to put together a group for the Montreux
festival, following his own move from Britain to Switzerland,
sealed his resolve.
 &HT;    ``It was like climbing Everest at first,'' he says with a laugh.
``I knew it was not going to be easy, but I didn't realize just how
difficult it was going to be to do it properly. You're sort of
playing along or snapping your fingers along to a Buddy Rich record
or a Count Basie record, and it's quite easy. But then actually
being in the driver's seat is very, very difficult.''
 &HT;    It wasn't easy for his fans, either. Despite ample advertising,
many who turned out for the band's tour performances expected to
hear the familiar versions of Collins' material. There were, he
acknowledges, ``some scenes'' _ at a show in suburban Detroit, he
even eliminated the encore portion of the show, during which he
planned to sing a couple of songs, because he felt that some in the
crowd had been rude to guest singer Oleta Adams.
 &HT;    But Collins hopes that, after the release of ``A Hot Night in
Paris,'' which was recorded last summer, his fans will grasp the
big-band concept and be more prepared for what they'll get when he
takes it on the road again next year.
 &HT;    ``I think there will be much more awareness of what it is next
time I go out, which will be great,'' he says. ``It's something I
want to continue. It's not a novelty for me _ it's something I
think is a big part of my years to come.''
 &HT;    Not that he's giving up on pop, however. Between promotional
jags for ``Tarzan'' he's beginning work on his next album, drawing
on material left over from previous recordings as well as more
recent ideas.
 &HT;    It may not sound like ``classic Collins,'' however. The
singer/songwriter notes that ``Tarzan'' and the big band have left
indelible marks on his creative sensibility.
 &HT;    ``I always like to try to do different things and keep moving,''
says the twice-divorced Collins, who is engaged to marry his
girlfriend, Orlanne Cevey. ``This and the big-band thing are two of
the most exciting things that have happened to me, really, for a
long time.
 &HT;    ``It's great it keeps sort of changing, even at this late
date.''

 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The booths are lined with show-biz power lunchers, sycophantic
waiters silently scurry about and the buzz of cell phones vies with
the soothing jazz wafting from hidden speakers.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's an average Wednesday afternoon at Chasen's, the
fabled see-and-be-seen Beverly Hills eatery.
</P>
<P>
   But for 7-year-old Catie Yagher, the day is anything but
ordinary. She's here with her mom, Catherine Hicks, star of the WB
network's surprise hit, ``7th Heaven,'' which recently wrapped its
third season.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the occasion, the little brunette has been allowed a
rare treat. Waving her tiny fingers, she shows off a carefully
applied set of miniature, press-on nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please believe me,'' Hicks says, ``this is not normal for us.
I'm really not big on little girls being made up to look like
adults _ that whole JonBenet Ramsey sort of thing _ but I gave in
this once because this is a very special day for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the youngster shifts her focus to her crayons and drawing
pad, Hicks relaxes for an interview. As bright and personable as
she is beautiful, she's also surprisingly sanguine for someone
who's survived a bumpy 20-year ride in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed easy at first. Less than two weeks after graduating
from Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., Hicks landed a recurring
role in the ABC soap ``Ryan's Hope.'' Soon afterward she was on
Broadway, acting with Jack Lemmon in ``Tribute.''
</P>
<P>
   An outstanding performance as Marilyn Monroe in ABC's ``Marilyn:
The Untold Story'' (1980) earned her rave reviews, huge ratings and
an Emmy nomination. Good parts in good movies followed: the
enchanting actress who charms Ron Silver in ``Garbo Talks'' (1984),
Kathleen Turner's excitable best friend in ``Peggy Sue Got
Married'' (1986) and the dedicated defender of whales in ``Star
Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' (1986).
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, her career began to falter. Lackluster film
roles, mediocre television movies and failed series began to pile
up.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, things had gotten critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad had died, and I'd bought this house near mine for my
mom,'' she recalls. ``One day I got a call from my business
manager, who said, `Cath, you've gone through your pension money
and everything else to pay for that house. You don't have a choice,
you're going to have to give it up.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I remember thinking, `This can't be!' I had this feeling,
deep down inside, that something or someone would come along to
save the day.''
</P>
<P>
   That savior turned out to be Aaron Spelling. The mastermind
behind such lowbrow fare as ``Dynasty,'' ``Beverly Hills 90210''
and ``Melrose Place'' had been asked by the fledgling WB network to
produce a family drama, created by former ``Mad About You'' writer
Brenda Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   In casting the saga of a compassionate minister and his family,
he immediately thought of Hicks, who had starred in a short-lived
1994 series he'd produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron remembered me from when we worked together on `Winnetka
Road,''' Hicks recalls. ``He called and said, `Please do this for
me.' And even though I really needed the work, I told him that I
didn't want to play a mom. So he said, `Just read the script.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I read it,'' she says, ``and as I was going through it I
kept saying to myself, `Oh yeah, I want to say that line, and that
one, and that one too!' The quality was so evident, and so was the
humor. That's when I realized I couldn't possibly turn it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Though pleased with the part _ and the paycheck _ Hicks still
had reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid to commit to it,'' she confesses, ``because a
weekly series really owns you. It was very hard the first season.
Even though it was a much-welcomed gift, I was a little resentful
of the show. I kept thinking, `Who are all these kids? I have my
own child I want to be with, and here I am pretending to be mother
to these strangers.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit that I wasn't that friendly,'' she adds, ``though
I wasn't really conscious of it. Isn't it amazing how we can all be
experts on how others should behave and yet have these giant blind
spots about our own behavior?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, I'm happy to report that that's all changed,'' she
concludes. ``Now we really love each other. They all love Catie and
she loves them. She's an only child, so it's like she's found all
these wonderful stepbrothers and sisters to spend time with.''
</P>
<P>
   In its third season, ``7th Heaven'' emerged as the
fastest-rising show on network television, after spending its first
couple of years in the ratings doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for the WB,'' Hicks says. ``If we'd been on one of
the bigger networks, we would have been yanked after three weeks.
But the folks at the WB really believed in us. We knew we weren't
going to get bounced if we didn't get big numbers right out of the
box. It's taken us over two years, but we've finally made it.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret of their success, she says, is the same thing which
initially caught her eye: good writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brenda prides herself on doing no rewriting,'' Hicks says.
``When she's done with a script, it's done. There's no interference
from Aaron or from the WB. A lot of times on network shows you end
up with this diluted junk, because there have been 15 rewrites
simply to appease executives who want to hear themselves talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``A script is a delicate puzzle,'' she adds. ``If you change or
delete one thing, you change the whole energy. Brenda knows
precisely what she wants, what stories will work, and they trust
her to deliver. As a result, every week there's something that
touches you.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hicks' own character, Annie Camden, she admits that it
took her some time to get used to the idea of playing a housebound
mom with seven kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``All through the first season I kept thinking, `God, I'm going
to be the Donna Reed of the '90s,'' she recalls. ``I was pretty
insecure about it. I kept saying to Brenda, `Couldn't she go to
night school or something?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I thought about the moms at my daughter's school,
lawyers and executives at the very top of their professions who
made the choice to stay at home with their kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started thinking about them, I stopped feeling like
Annie was some sort of freak,'' she says. ``Sure, she spends a lot
of her time in the kitchen, but she's strong and she's smart, too.
And I get so much gratitude from fans. They look me right in the
eye and say, `Thank you. Thank you for what your show has done for
my family.'''
</P>
<P>
   And, speaking of families, it's time to wrap things up. Catie
has been promised a trip to her dad's office _ Hicks' husband is
special-effects designer Kevin Yagher _ and she's eager to get
going.
</P>
<P>
   But before they can depart, disaster strikes. One of Catie's
precious new nails pops off and sinks into her mom's cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' Hicks says. ``I'm sure the nice people here at
Chasen's can get it back for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick as a wink, the cup is whisked into the kitchen. Moments
later, a waiter returns to solemnly present the polished pink
treasure to his young customer. Catie squeals with delight.
</P>
<P>
   It's another happy ending. Of course.

 (Includes a color slide of Bill Pullman with Brendan Gleeson in a
scene from ``Lake Placid.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Lions and tigers and bears, oh my.
 &HT;    Bill Pullman was in the wilds of Vancouver, British Columbia,
roughing it with the cast of an upcoming movie in which he plays a
macho game warden, but there's a big difference between acting and
being.
 &HT;    ``Listen, Bill,'' the forest-ranger liaison told him, ``when it
gets dark, for God's sake do not venture out of your campgrounds.
There have been bear attacks in the area.''
 &HT;    So picture the reaction of Bridget Fonda, his co-star in ``Lake
Placid,'' when Pullman announced around midnight that he was going
for a walk to pick blackberries.
 &HT;    ``I was screaming, `Bill, don't go! The bears!''' Fonda recalls.
``You see, I panic for other people. But Bill gets this glint in
his eye and says, `I'll be back with dessert.'''
 &HT;    Pullman says he didn't actually think much of it.
 &HT;    ``I didn't take the ranger seriously at all. Modern society has
gotten us all a little neurotic,'' the actor says. ``I figured if I
made a little noise going into the woods, then the bear would leave
me alone or ask for an autograph.''
 &HT;    But once he was alone in the forest ...
 &HT;    ``I guess nerves did take over,'' he says. ``By the end of my
walk, I was banging so many sticks and cups together that I sounded
like a percussion section.''
 &HT;    As he relaxes over a Saturday-morning breakfast at Los Angeles'
Four Seasons Hotel, Pullman doesn't look much like an outdoorsman.
Model-handsome in black slacks and a gray shirt, with overgrown
bangs falling into his face, the 45-year-old actor doesn't look
like he'd have much of an idea of what to do if confronted by a
30-foot-long, man-eating crocodile in the pristine Maine
wilderness.
 &HT;    But that's the setup for ``Lake Placid,'' which opens July 16
nationwide. Pullman's character heads a group of misfits including
a nature-phobic paleontologist (Fonda), an out-of-his-league
sheriff (Brendan Gleeson) and an eccentric mythology professor
(Oliver Platt) who must somehow capture or kill the deadly
creature.
 &HT;    His advisors urged him not to sign on to what is essentially an
inland ``Jaws,'' Pullman says. But he liked the script, written by
David E. Kelley, creator of ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal.''
And besides, he had another, less typical reason for making the
movie.
 &HT;    ``Secretly, I wanted to do it for my brother,'' Pullman says.
``When we were growing up, our hero was a forest ranger from
upstate New York named Art Flick, who wrote for Field and Stream.
He had a patch on his sleeve and the coolest truck just loaded with
gear. We wanted to be Flick.
 &HT;    ``I knew if I did this movie and played a ranger, my brother
would be so jealous,'' he adds with a wicked laugh. ``He's only a
doctor. I could be a ranger!''
 &HT;    Other than squaring off against some pretty ugly aliens in
``Independence Day'' (1996), Pullman didn't have much experience
with monster movies. His typical roles as good-guy leading men in
such films as ``Sleepless in Seattle'' (1993), ``Malice'' (1993)
and ``While You Were Sleeping'' (1996) weren't the kind that lead
an actor to spend weeks in a freezing-cold lake with a huge,
artificial crocodile.
 &HT;    ``The weird thing in the water is that you would notice waves
that were not being made by our effects crew,'' Pullman says. ``All
of a sudden, a huge beaver would swim by you.
 &HT;    ``Beavers do not respect actors.''
 &HT;    At other times, he recalls, his own imagination was his worst
enemy.
 &HT;    ``You're psyched up to do a horror movie, and all of a sudden in
the lake, something with tentacles grabs at your feet,'' he says.
``You jump, and then blush when you realize it's only a big weed.''
 &HT;    It's a strange way to make a living, especially for a boy from
Hornell, N.Y., who's the son of a doctor father and a nurse mother,
and whose four siblings who are all in the medical profession.
 &HT;    Given this background, he says, his parents were ``horrified''
when their youngest son, a National Merit Scholarship winner,
decided to forgo medical school in favor of a two-year vocational
school for building construction.
 &HT;    ``At school I think I gave the plumbing students an inferiority
complex,'' Pullman says.
 &HT;    He wanted to go into urban planning _ until a teacher at the
vocational school insisted he join their drama club.
 &HT;    ``Yes, they had a drama program,'' Pullman says. ``One day I
showed up for auditions with some refrigeration students.''
 &HT;    Something clicked, and Pullman abandoned technical school for
drama, earning a master's degree in directing from the University
of Massachusetts at Amherst. He subsequently produced plays and
taught at Montana State University, where he ran the theater
department for two years.
 &HT;    In the 1980s, after a stint studying directing in England,
Pullman moved to New York to pursue an acting career. He was
advised to try the stage, because he wasn't film-star material.
 &HT;    ``I heard, `Your face is not distinctive,''' he says.
 &HT;    Determined to prove otherwise, he moved to Los Angeles, working
at the Los Angeles Theatre Center and angling for movie roles. His
film debut came in ``Ruthless People'' (1986).
 &HT;    Since then, and especially since his breakout role in
``Sleepless in Seattle,'' Pullman has alternated mainstream roles
in films such as ``While You Were Sleeping'' and ``Independence
Day'' with quirkier fare such as ``The Last Seduction'' (1994) and
David Lynch's ``Lost Highway'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``I make strange choices,'' he says, ``because the curse in this
business is when the powers go, `We have this type of role. Get me
a Bill Pullman type.'
 &HT;    ``I think of my type as still evolving,'' Pullman says. ``In
fact, my favorite question from a journalist is `What is your
favorite role?' My answer always will be, `It's a role I haven't
played yet.'''
 &HT;    Not all his roles have been seen, however. Take his role in
director Terrence Malick's long-awaited comeback film, ``The Thin
Red Line'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``It was disappointing,'' Pullman says. ``At one point during
production, Terry thought I should narrate the film. So he sent me
28 single-spaced pages of very complicated dialogue. I worked on it
with him for weeks.''
 &HT;    Then one day Malick called to inform Pullman that he was no
longer the narrator. In fact, he was no longer in the movie at all
_ his role had been cut in its entirety.
 &HT;    ``I guess the people who are actually in the movie should say
the narration,'' Pullman says, shrugging. ``To me every role is a
lark _ I don't let it hurt me.''
 &HT;    Besides, he's too busy to brood. He's currently scouting
Canadian locations for his screen directorial debut, a TNT
adaptation of Owen Wister's classic novel ``The Virginian,'' in
which he will also star.
 &HT;    ``The best part of directing is that I finally feel like an
urban planner,'' Pullman says. ``I'm actually building a Western
town. The other day I found myself saying, `Let's build the school
here.'
 &HT;    ``It's nice how things come full circle.''
 &HT;    As for his career, his viewpoint seems to have been shaped by
his recent wilderness excursion.
 &HT;    ``I think of Hollywood like it's a forest,'' Pullman says.
``Most days I'm swimming through a lake. There are some cold places
in that lake. There are warm places. You just have to keep floating
around, not knowing what will happen next.''

 &HT;    This could be big. Really big.
 &HT;    And Phil Collins knows big when he sees it. The British
singer/musician/songwriter/producer _ and occasional actor _ has
released eight multimillion-selling solo albums, plus another
half-dozen during his years with the band Genesis.
 &HT;    But even he's awed by the scale of his latest project, five
songs for the Walt Disney Co.'s new animated feature, ``Tarzan.''
 &HT;    ``It has the potential to be vast _ and I don't necessarily mean
in financial terms, just in terms of the kind of audience it can
reach once these things get on a roll,'' the 48-year-old Collins
says.
 &HT;    ``The music in these films, it's part of movie heritage,'' he
explains. ``You think of the songs almost before you think of the
stories, the old songs like `When You Wish Upon a Star,' `Whistle
While You Work.' The music has always been so integral to those
films. I'm proud to be part of it, actually.''
 &HT;    A big part, really. Collins recorded 10 different versions of
the various songs for the `Tarzan'' soundtrack album, including
separate versions of ``Trashin' the Camp'' with actress Rosie
O'Donnell and with the pop group `N Sync. The album swung into the
Billboard Top 10 during the week following the film's release.
 &HT;    But Collins didn't simply write the songs, as such predecessors
as Howard Ashman/Alan Menken and Tim Rice/Elton John have. He also
sings them in the movie, rather than their being sung by
``Tarzan's'' characters, as in a true musical. Even John sang only
one song in ``The Lion King'' (1994), and that was over the closing
credits.
 &HT;    ``The only other comparable thing was Elton,'' Collins says,
``and his brief was different _ that he write, with Tim Rice, some
songs that would work for the movie. The music was taken and shaken
about a bit and sung by the characters in the film, and he sort of
did the end-credit thing. That's the traditional way it's been.''
 &HT;    Disney wanted a different approach for ``Tarzan,'' which
initially worried Collins.
 &HT;    ``They wanted to break a few molds with this,'' he says. ``I was
a bit apprehensive at first, of people hearing my voice instead of
the characters. For me, that was a worrying issue, but for them, it
wasn't.
 &HT;    ``It obviously makes the film different from anything they've
done before,'' he adds, ``but from my point of view it makes me an
integral part of the movie, which is better than just writing the
songs.''
 &HT;    ``Tarzan'' is only the latest step in the evolution of Collins,
a former child actor who joined Genesis as its drummer in 1970 and
moved out front as its lead singer following Peter Gabriel's
departure in 1975. In 1994 he himself left the group, to
concentrate on his solo career _ though he did participate with the
band in a new recording of their hit ``The Carpet Crawlers'' for a
greatest-hits album, due out this fall.
 &HT;    Since Collins' departure, Genesis has struggled. Founders Tony
Banks and Mike Rutherford replaced Collins with Ray Wilson for
their first album without him, ``Calling All Stations'' (1997).
Fans, particularly American fans, generally criticized the album,
which Collins doesn't mind saying he finds unfair.
 &HT;    ``I mean, all those Genesis fans who have been wringing on over
the last 15 years that I f--ked the band up by taking it and giving
it commercial success, those are the people who should be loving
this band now,'' Collins says. ``I'm not there, and they've got
Tony and Mike, who are basically the spirit of Genesis, writing the
songs ... and they've turned their backs on the band.''
 &HT;    If ``Tarzan'' seems a bit off the beaten track for a longtime
rock star, his other current musical project is even more unusual:
a big band, which he introduced in Switzerland at the 1997 Montreux
Jazz Festival and took on tour in 1998, playing brass-fueled
versions of Genesis favorites, his own solo hits and occasional
covers. In July the band will release a live album, ``A Hot Night
in Paris.''
 &HT;    Collins says the big-band idea was spurred by his desire to
reconnect with drumming after years of fronting Genesis and his
solo band. An invitation to put together a group for the Montreux
festival, following his own move from Britain to Switzerland,
sealed his resolve.
 &HT;    ``It was like climbing Everest at first,'' he says with a laugh.
``I knew it was not going to be easy, but I didn't realize just how
difficult it was going to be to do it properly. You're sort of
playing along or snapping your fingers along to a Buddy Rich record
or a Count Basie record, and it's quite easy. But then actually
being in the driver's seat is very, very difficult.''
 &HT;    It wasn't easy for his fans, either. Despite ample advertising,
many who turned out for the band's tour performances expected to
hear the familiar versions of Collins' material. There were, he
acknowledges, ``some scenes'' _ at a show in suburban Detroit, he
even eliminated the encore portion of the show, during which he
planned to sing a couple of songs, because he felt that some in the
crowd had been rude to guest singer Oleta Adams.
 &HT;    But Collins hopes that, after the release of ``A Hot Night in
Paris,'' which was recorded last summer, his fans will grasp the
big-band concept and be more prepared for what they'll get when he
takes it on the road again next year.
 &HT;    ``I think there will be much more awareness of what it is next
time I go out, which will be great,'' he says. ``It's something I
want to continue. It's not a novelty for me _ it's something I
think is a big part of my years to come.''
 &HT;    Not that he's giving up on pop, however. Between promotional
jags for ``Tarzan'' he's beginning work on his next album, drawing
on material left over from previous recordings as well as more
recent ideas.
 &HT;    It may not sound like ``classic Collins,'' however. The
singer/songwriter notes that ``Tarzan'' and the big band have left
indelible marks on his creative sensibility.
 &HT;    ``I always like to try to do different things and keep moving,''
says the twice-divorced Collins, who is engaged to marry his
girlfriend, Orlanne Cevey. ``This and the big-band thing are two of
the most exciting things that have happened to me, really, for a
long time.
 &HT;    ``It's great it keeps sort of changing, even at this late
date.''

ALL-`AMERICAN' GIRL: MENA SUVARI STARS IN `AMERICAN PIE'

 (Includes a color slide of Mena Suvari with Chris Klein in a scene
from ``American Pie.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Walking along a Los Angeles street one day in May, someone she
didn't know recognized Mena Suvari.
 &HT;    ``It was,'' Suvari says, ``a little ... weird.''
 &HT;    The 20-year-old actress had never before been recognized by a
stranger, despite roles in the films ``Nowhere'' (1997) ``Kiss the
Girls'' (1997) and ``The Rage: Carrie 2'' (1999). It took, of all
things, the dunderheaded Rob Lowe miniseries ``Atomic Train'' to
win her one of the classic signs of impending stardom.
 &HT;    ``If I sat down and thought about being recognized, it would
have weirded me out,'' Suvari says. ``Everybody always says, `Oh, I
never thought it would happen to me,' and I didn't think it would
happen for me.
 &HT;    ``So many people are here in L.A. trying hard to make it in this
business, and for me it's just been so much easier than it could
have been. Things are really happening.''
 &HT;    Suvari's not kidding. The petite, blue-eyed blonde stars in two
highly anticipated films, namely the raunchy teen comedy ``American
Pie,'' opening July 9, and ``American Beauty,'' a dark and sexy
drama due out this fall.
 &HT;    The titles may be similar, but it shouldn't be too hard to tell
the two films apart: ``American Beauty'' is a high-profile drama
co-starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, while ``American Pie''
... well, it's about four horny high-school boys who make a pact to
lose their virginity before graduation, and you don't want to know
what the title refers to.
 &HT;    Suvari plays Heather, the angelic choirgirl who catches the
attention of Oz (Chris Klein), a hunky lacrosse player who prefers
to be called ``Casanova.''
 &HT;    Plumbing the same shameless depths as ``There's Something About
Mary,'' ``American Pie'' features crude jokes, nudity and more than
the usual amount of baked-goods sleaze. Think ``Porky's'' meets
``Fast Times at Ridgemont High.''
 &HT;    ``I think America is ready for it,'' Suvari says by telephone
from the Los Angeles home she shares with her boyfriend. ``A close
friend of mine told me the other day that she liked the film
because most films haven't gone there, in terms of the sexual
experiences shown and the funniness of it all. It's out there, but
I think people are ready for it.''
 &HT;    Heather, of course, doesn't go out there.
 &HT;    ``She's kind of innocent, and I tend to play that role a lot,''
Suvari says, laughing. ``I lived in South Carolina before I moved
out to L.A., and I was involved in the choir, so it was easy to
jump back into that mindset.
 &HT;    ``The relationship between Heather and Oz is so sweet,'' she
adds. ``All the funny stuff happens in other parts of the movie,
which makes our scenes stand out and grounds the film a little more
in reality.''
 &HT;    Suvari's co-stars Shannon Elizabeth, Tara Reid, Alyson Hannigan
and Natasha Lyonne play much flashier characters and, yes, Suvari
did feel twinges of jealousy.
 &HT;    ``Of course I did, but I loved my character just the same,'' she
says. ``I didn't audition for the other roles.
 &HT;    ``I guess my agents or maybe the film's casting people just
didn't see me as any of the other roles,'' she says. ``There's a
part of me that could have played Vicky (Reid) or Jessica (Lyonne),
but Heather was the role that I could most easily identify with.''
 &HT;    Suvari didn't identify so easily with Angela, the title
character in ``American Beauty.''
 &HT;    ``Talk about playing different sides of yourself,'' she says.
``Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are a married couple. They're
both having affairs on the side, and he's chasing after me.
 &HT;    ``I'm their daughter's best friend,'' the young actress adds.
``My character is very sly and manipulative, yet somehow
innocent.''
 &HT;    Oh, and she kisses Spacey.
 &HT;    ``It was just like kissing any other person,'' Suvari says,
laughing. ``He's an intelligent, experienced actor, and he knows
how to make things comfortable on the set.
 &HT;    ``He was nice and polite to me, and very funny,'' she adds. ``He
can also be intimidating. I've heard people say that about him _ he
takes what he does seriously, and expects everyone else to do that,
too.''
 &HT;    Even more intimidating for Suvari, however, was stepping into
``American Beauty's'' first table reading _ an informal rehearsal _
with director Sam Mendes.
 &HT;    ``That was scary,'' she says. ``I walked into the room and saw
Kevin, Annette, Sam Mendes and everyone else sitting there, and I
had to say, `Hello, I'm going to be working with you ... '
 &HT;    ``It made me feel I wanted to try even harder. I wanted to keep
up with these experienced actors. And every direction Sam gave me I
listened to.''
 &HT;    Like so many actresses, the Rhode Island-born Suvari began her
professional career as a model. She first posed before a camera as
a sixth-grader living in South Carolina, then visited Los Angeles
when she was cast in a Rice-a-Roni commercial.
 &HT;    ``After that my agency said, `You should move out here,' which
we did,'' Suvari says, the ``we'' referring to her parents and
three brothers. ``I did acting as kind of an afterschool hobby.''
 &HT;    When she graduated from high school in 1997, she adds, ``I
started thinking of acting as my job, and I took it very
seriously.''
 &HT;    Now she's beginning to truly enjoy the craft and all that comes
with it.
 &HT;    ``Everything fascinates me,'' Suvari says. ``I like the
challenge that's involved in playing someone else. I like meaty
roles, roles that have some texture.
 &HT;    ``It's all so new to me, meeting people, taking direction,
having people really like a film that I'm in,'' she says. ``I think
I'm very blessed to have been given what I've got so far.''

 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The booths are lined with show-biz power lunchers, sycophantic
waiters silently scurry about and the buzz of cell phones vies with
the soothing jazz wafting from hidden speakers.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's an average Wednesday afternoon at Chasen's, the
fabled see-and-be-seen Beverly Hills eatery.
</P>
<P>
   But for 7-year-old Catie Yagher, the day is anything but
ordinary. She's here with her mom, Catherine Hicks, star of the WB
network's surprise hit, ``7th Heaven,'' which recently wrapped its
third season.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the occasion, the little brunette has been allowed a
rare treat. Waving her tiny fingers, she shows off a carefully
applied set of miniature, press-on nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please believe me,'' Hicks says, ``this is not normal for us.
I'm really not big on little girls being made up to look like
adults _ that whole JonBenet Ramsey sort of thing _ but I gave in
this once because this is a very special day for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the youngster shifts her focus to her crayons and drawing
pad, Hicks relaxes for an interview. As bright and personable as
she is beautiful, she's also surprisingly sanguine for someone
who's survived a bumpy 20-year ride in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed easy at first. Less than two weeks after graduating
from Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., Hicks landed a recurring
role in the ABC soap ``Ryan's Hope.'' Soon afterward she was on
Broadway, acting with Jack Lemmon in ``Tribute.''
</P>
<P>
   An outstanding performance as Marilyn Monroe in ABC's ``Marilyn:
The Untold Story'' (1980) earned her rave reviews, huge ratings and
an Emmy nomination. Good parts in good movies followed: the
enchanting actress who charms Ron Silver in ``Garbo Talks'' (1984),
Kathleen Turner's excitable best friend in ``Peggy Sue Got
Married'' (1986) and the dedicated defender of whales in ``Star
Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' (1986).
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, her career began to falter. Lackluster film
roles, mediocre television movies and failed series began to pile
up.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, things had gotten critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad had died, and I'd bought this house near mine for my
mom,'' she recalls. ``One day I got a call from my business
manager, who said, `Cath, you've gone through your pension money
and everything else to pay for that house. You don't have a choice,
you're going to have to give it up.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I remember thinking, `This can't be!' I had this feeling,
deep down inside, that something or someone would come along to
save the day.''
</P>
<P>
   That savior turned out to be Aaron Spelling. The mastermind
behind such lowbrow fare as ``Dynasty,'' ``Beverly Hills 90210''
and ``Melrose Place'' had been asked by the fledgling WB network to
produce a family drama, created by former ``Mad About You'' writer
Brenda Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   In casting the saga of a compassionate minister and his family,
he immediately thought of Hicks, who had starred in a short-lived
1994 series he'd produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron remembered me from when we worked together on `Winnetka
Road,''' Hicks recalls. ``He called and said, `Please do this for
me.' And even though I really needed the work, I told him that I
didn't want to play a mom. So he said, `Just read the script.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I read it,'' she says, ``and as I was going through it I
kept saying to myself, `Oh yeah, I want to say that line, and that
one, and that one too!' The quality was so evident, and so was the
humor. That's when I realized I couldn't possibly turn it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Though pleased with the part _ and the paycheck _ Hicks still
had reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid to commit to it,'' she confesses, ``because a
weekly series really owns you. It was very hard the first season.
Even though it was a much-welcomed gift, I was a little resentful
of the show. I kept thinking, `Who are all these kids? I have my
own child I want to be with, and here I am pretending to be mother
to these strangers.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit that I wasn't that friendly,'' she adds, ``though
I wasn't really conscious of it. Isn't it amazing how we can all be
experts on how others should behave and yet have these giant blind
spots about our own behavior?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, I'm happy to report that that's all changed,'' she
concludes. ``Now we really love each other. They all love Catie and
she loves them. She's an only child, so it's like she's found all
these wonderful stepbrothers and sisters to spend time with.''
</P>
<P>
   In its third season, ``7th Heaven'' emerged as the
fastest-rising show on network television, after spending its first
couple of years in the ratings doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for the WB,'' Hicks says. ``If we'd been on one of
the bigger networks, we would have been yanked after three weeks.
But the folks at the WB really believed in us. We knew we weren't
going to get bounced if we didn't get big numbers right out of the
box. It's taken us over two years, but we've finally made it.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret of their success, she says, is the same thing which
initially caught her eye: good writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brenda prides herself on doing no rewriting,'' Hicks says.
``When she's done with a script, it's done. There's no interference
from Aaron or from the WB. A lot of times on network shows you end
up with this diluted junk, because there have been 15 rewrites
simply to appease executives who want to hear themselves talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``A script is a delicate puzzle,'' she adds. ``If you change or
delete one thing, you change the whole energy. Brenda knows
precisely what she wants, what stories will work, and they trust
her to deliver. As a result, every week there's something that
touches you.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hicks' own character, Annie Camden, she admits that it
took her some time to get used to the idea of playing a housebound
mom with seven kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``All through the first season I kept thinking, `God, I'm going
to be the Donna Reed of the '90s,'' she recalls. ``I was pretty
insecure about it. I kept saying to Brenda, `Couldn't she go to
night school or something?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I thought about the moms at my daughter's school,
lawyers and executives at the very top of their professions who
made the choice to stay at home with their kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started thinking about them, I stopped feeling like
Annie was some sort of freak,'' she says. ``Sure, she spends a lot
of her time in the kitchen, but she's strong and she's smart, too.
And I get so much gratitude from fans. They look me right in the
eye and say, `Thank you. Thank you for what your show has done for
my family.'''
</P>
<P>
   And, speaking of families, it's time to wrap things up. Catie
has been promised a trip to her dad's office _ Hicks' husband is
special-effects designer Kevin Yagher _ and she's eager to get
going.
</P>
<P>
   But before they can depart, disaster strikes. One of Catie's
precious new nails pops off and sinks into her mom's cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' Hicks says. ``I'm sure the nice people here at
Chasen's can get it back for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick as a wink, the cup is whisked into the kitchen. Moments
later, a waiter returns to solemnly present the polished pink
treasure to his young customer. Catie squeals with delight.
</P>
<P>
   It's another happy ending. Of course.

TOUGH TEST LIES AHEAD FOR GOP FRONT-RUNNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On the face of it, California would seem like
friendly territory for Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Like Texas, it is a large state that shares a border with Mexico
and boasts a bustling high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   If the comparisons stopped there, Bush would have little to
worry about as he embarks this week on his first presidential
campaign swing to the vote-rich Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   But the political differences between Texas and California could
hardly be more stark.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has a Republican in every elected statewide office. In
California, where the Clinton-Gore team won in 1992 and 1996,
Democrats hold all the major statewide elected offices (the GOP
holds two lesser offices) and both houses of the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush won impressive numbers of Hispanic voters and
women in his 1998 re-election campaign, some experts say his
conservative positions on such issues as abortion, guns and the
environment could put him on the defensive with the California
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think California will be a real test for his message,'' said
Raphael Shonenshein, a political scientist at California State
University in Fullerton. ``People will easily decode style over
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush nevertheless has had an impressive start in California _
even before showing up.
</P>
<P>
   As in other states, Bush is far outpacing his Republican rivals
in California in money and in opinion polls. A recent Los Angeles
Times poll had Bush leading Elizabeth Dole 50-13, with other GOP
hopefuls stuck in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   A hypothetical matchup between Bush and Vice President Al Gore,
however, is much tighter. The Times poll showed Bush ahead 49-44,
but that is a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore recently completed his 57th visit to California, which
has been kind to his campaign coffers, generating more than $1
million in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is no slouch in California fund-raising circles, either.
The state has given him his second-highest number of dollars _
behind Texas _ and Bush has already had to move a Silicon Valley
fund-raiser scheduled for next week to a new location because the
first site could not hold everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Beckwith, a Bush spokesman, predicted that the governor
will pull in a whopping $3 million during the three-day swing,
which will squeeze in at least seven fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valley has historically been pretty apolitical,'' said
Floyd Kvamme, a Bush backer and member of the Technology Network, a
group of high-tech companies that have banded together to advance
their political agenda. ``An awful lot of companies are realizing
we're not going to escape notice any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kvamme is one of many high-tech executives who have met with
Bush in Austin. Months ago, Bush strategist Karl Rove helped
organize several meetings with computer executives, many of whom
have joined the California fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous number of our people have operations in Texas,
either in Dallas-Fort Worth or in the Austin area,'' Kvamme said.
``They've seen what's happened in Texas and they like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters say the high-tech angle provides the governor
with an opportunity to favorably contrast himself with Gore, who
has developed strong ties to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   One issue is the wave of lawsuits that could stem from the Y2K
bug, a widespread programming glitch that is expected to cause many
computers to fail because they will recognize the year 2000 as
1900.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are eager to use that issue to drive a wedge between
Gore and a top source of Democratic campaign money, trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed a bill in Texas limiting business liability for the
Y2K bug; the Clinton administration has voiced objections to
legislation in Congress limiting liability.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Silicon Valley, the Bush camp is hoping that his
``compassionate conservatism'' and Texas-tested appeal to Hispanics
will help attract voters who have been turned off to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who criticized a California initiative aimed at cutting
off education to the children of undocumented immigrants, won about
40 percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas last year, polling data
show.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Leonard, a California assemblyman representing the area
between Los Angeles and Palm Springs, called Bush a ``natural'' who
is more like Ronald Reagan (a former California governor) than his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``His compassionate conservatism is the same kind of optimism
and confidence in the future of America,'' Leonard said. ``He has
said some of the most conservative things that have ever been said
on the national stage, but he has said it with a smile on his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, say that by the time Californians find out
more about Bush, support for him will drop precipitously.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the National Abortion Rights Action League is
announcing an Internet-based advertising campaign ``exposing Bush's
`two-step' on abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that he supports the concept of a constitutional
amendment outlawing abortion but that most Americans are not ready
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll pay a price in California on the abortion issue,'' said
Bob Mulholland, spokesman for the California Democratic Party. ``He
doesn't fit California. He's from Texas, and he doesn't support a
woman's right to choose. California is the most pro-choice state in
the union.''

<P>
   Gore vs. Bush? Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   The real race of the summer is the battle between Smith and
Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   Both Will Smith and Adam Sandler have new movies to tout, so
both are gunning for your vote at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate: Will Smith
</P>
<P>
   Personal stats: Age: 30. Birth date: Sept. 25, 1968, in Philly.
</P>
<P>
   Current campaign offering: ``Wild Wild West,'' Smith's upgrade
of the old TV series about a James Bond type battling Old American
West evil. Opens Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Running mate: WWW co-star Kevin Kline.
</P>
<P>
   Political style: He'll charm you into voting for him. Don't, and
he'll kick your butt.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign slogan: ``A vote for me is a vote to get jiggy.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign platform: Promises free Will Smith CDs with every
purchase of a movie ticket _ has to be one of his movies, though.
</P>
<P>
   Family values: Has a son from a previous marriage, William
``Trey'' Smith III. Smith's recent hit, ``Just the Two of Us,'' is
a tribute to him. Awwww. Smith married actress Jada Pinkett, 27, on
New Year's Eve '97; the couple's first kiddo, Jaden Christopher
Syre Smith, arrived a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising ability: Uh-oh. Sandler's the favored choice in
this category: Smith's last pic, ``Enemy of the State,'' made
around $60 mil, about half of what Sandler's last movie, ``The
Waterboy,'' took in. You can still bank on Smith, though: He was
the driving force behind blockbusters ``Men in Black'' and
``Independence Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Formative years: Smith honed his acting abilities on the
often-funny TV series ``Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire.''
</P>
<P>
   Baggage: Nothing too bad: He was one-half of a really lame rap
act, Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff. Oh, yeah, and his ``Fresh
Prince'' wardrobe _ loud, mismatched colors, baggier than Walter
Matthau's face _ was heinous. Thankfully, he became one of two
``Men in Black.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The candidate: Adam Sandler
</P>
<P>
   Personal stats: Age: 32. Birth date: Sept. 9, 1966, in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Current campaign offering: ``Big Daddy.'' Wisecracker Sandler
suddenly has to father a little boy. Chaos ensues. Ha, ha.
</P>
<P>
   Running mate: Cole and Dylan Sprouse, the twin kiddo co-stars of
``Big Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Political style: Shy but cheeky; he'd propose a bill that would
make it illegal for women to wear bras, but he'd be too meek to
defend it in court.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign slogan: (Sung to the tune of his hit ``The Chanuka
Song'') ``Please, please vote for me-akah/Then I can get my own
Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign platform: Would make sure every issue of TV Guide
included a page of bathroom jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Family values: Never been married, but just got engaged to model
Jackie Titone, 24. Gets points for once dating Alicia Silverstone.
I'll vote for ya, Adam, if you give me her number.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising ability: Sandler's last movie, ``The Waterboy,''
raked in more than $130 million. Resume also includes ``Happy
Gilmore,'' ``Billy Madison'' and the sweet romance ``The Wedding
Singer.''
</P>
<P>
   Formative years: First taste of Hollywood: a small role on ``The
Cosby Show,'' playing a friend of Theo. Anyone 'member that?
Sandler got his real start on ``Saturday Night Live,'' playing the
role of cute dunderheads like Cajun Man and Opera Man; he also made
a name for himself as a dangerously hilarious stand-up comedian. We
love his funny songs, too.
</P>
<P>
   Baggage: In high school, he had a really big 'fro. Really big.

EIGHT IDEAS TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF THE FAMILY ROAD TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traveling with the family on the blazing-hot highway should be a
part of every kid's summer plans. Sure, all that togetherness in
the family truckster can wear on your nerves, but what better way
is there to bond? To help you survive the time in the car, we
rounded up the best of the new family-friendly,
stop-the-fracas-in-the-backseat stuff in town.
</P>
<P>
   1. You've seen those talking globes that test you with geography
questions. Now they've been miniaturized for travel. The
Educational Insights GeoSafari Talking Globe Traveler for kids 8
and up will keep your kids' brains from turning to mush as the
miles fly by. The globe will ask more than 5,000 questions _ Is
Portugal a country? Where is Nairobi? _ and can be held in the palm
of your offspring's hand. Available at toy stores. $50-$60.
</P>
<P>
   2. Fidget and fiddle for a good reason: Make shapes out of
Rainbow Twist Cubes, about a dozen brightly colored wooden blocks
on a stretchy string. They're entertaining for 4-year-olds and
addled adults alike. Produced by Pappa Gepetto's Toys, Rainbow
Twist Cubes can be bought for $6 (three-inch), and $11.50
(five-inch).
</P>
<P>
   3. Stop arguing over the radio station and try some new music
that has a chance of pleasing the whole family. ``For Our Children
Too!'' features family favorites sung by adult contemporary
performers: Luther Vandross sings ``If I Had a Hammer,'' Celine
Dion performs ``Brahms' Lullaby'' and Faith Hill sings ``Over the
Rainbow.'' If the music isn't your thing, be comforted by the fact
that proceeds from the CD benefit the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. If
you want something new instead of old standbys, ``Reggae for Kids''
introduces the upbeat music with songs that appeal to children.
Tapes are $12-$13 and CDs are $18-$19.
</P>
<P>
   4. Buy your kids disposable cameras and make them the trip
historians. Check out the Photo Fun! Vacation kit, a box full of
supplies to send postcards from the road and put vacation photos on
display. The kit comes with caption stickers, a hot-pink inflatable
picture frame, and a memory album for storing pictures and
souvenirs. Made by Photoco; available for about $15.
</P>
<P>
   5. Traveling with toddlers? The spill-proof Snack-Up Cup holds
11 ounces, and a compartment attached to the bottom holds a small
snack. The cup keeps everything in one place and, with any luck,
keeps grape juice from getting all over the car. From The First
Years; available at discount and toy stores for about $6.
</P>
<P>
   6. Your car will collect clutter. It just will. To control the
chaos, cram toys, papers, snacks and tissues into the pockets of an
organizer attached to the back of the front seat. This can be used
for trip necessities or as an activity center for kids, and it will
provide at least the illusion of order. We saw versions we liked
for $10-$12.
</P>
<P>
   7. Reduce the whining by keeping kids comfy. Toddlers can sleep
in their car seats with a wrap-around cushion that will protect
their necks. For about the same price, you can find an adult-size
neck cushion, but only the children's cushions from The First Years
have Sesame Street characters. Available at toy and discount
stores. Approximate price: $10.
</P>
<P>
   8. Travel activity books published by Klutz Press are a favorite
with kids and parents. ``The Amazing Backseat Book-a-ma-Thing''
promises ``thousands of miles' worth of hands-on games and
activities'' and contains everything from a pinball baseball game
to an acetate-sheet Magic Writer. ``The Etch A Sketch Book''
contains a mini-Etch A Sketch and pages of suggestions for how to
use it. Our favorite, though, is ``Pipe Cleaners Gone Crazy: A
Complete Guide to Bending Fuzzy Sticks.'' The step-by-step
instruction book comes with enough pipe cleaners to do every
project. All are appropriate for children of reading age; available
at children's bookstores. $13-$20. nn

WRITER HORTON FOOTE SAVORS LIFE IN HIS BOYHOOD HOME OF WHARTON,
TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHARTON, Texas _ This hamlet of 10,000 residents in the muddy
lowlands 60 miles southwest of Houston is laid out in long, thin
blocks around the Colorado River. In the center of one of these
blocks, not far from Wharton's old-fashioned town square, is a
bright, canary-yellow frame house. Living in that house is
83-year-old Horton Foote, perhaps America's most honored dramatist
and certainly, along with TV newsman Dan Rather, Wharton's most
distinguished native son.
</P>
<P>
   Foote, whose glittering resume includes two Academy Awards for
best screenplay and a Pulitzer Prize for drama, is required by
obligations in the theater business to spend some of his time in
New York. But for the past dozen years, he has returned to the
house on Wharton's North Houston Street where he grew up, the house
his grandfather built as a gift for Horton's parents in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for me to live here,'' said Foote, now 83, as he sat
in his cool, comfortable parlor. ``I also keep a place in New York
City. My son lives there, so it's not wasted when I'm here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, people act a little different towards me, very
respectful. Here, they treat me just like someone they grew up
with. Not that too many people I really grew up with are still
present, but there's still the sense of just being home I don't
have anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote's sense of home has been prevalent in almost all his
writing. His plays in particular are inevitably set in fictional
Texas towns that mirror Wharton. The characters he creates reflect
the huge, tightly knit, colorful family who surrounded him during
his early years.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the town of Wharton is crucial to Foote's creativity,
his childhood home itself may be more so. It was at the breakfast
table or on the porch during warm summer evenings that Foote's
grandparents, parents, uncles and aunts regaled him with tales of
family history that became, decades later, the basis for plays and
telecasts and films.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Brookes-Foote House, as it's listed in the National
Directory of Historic Places, has been brought to greater
prominence by Foote's recently published ``Farewell: A Memoir of a
Texas Childhood'' (Scribner, $24). In this book, he allows readers
to join in Foote family gatherings, sharing the same stories,
heartbreak and dreams that fuel real lives as well as fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might say I've been thinking about writing this book all
my life,'' Foote said. ``I wanted to re-create this Texas childhood
of mine, but without it being an autobiography. I wanted to write
about these other wonderful people and perhaps bring back to
readers' memories some of the places, the rooms, where they once
lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote acknowledged that ``Farewell,'' which has received
rapturous critical reviews and probably will be short-listed for
Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award consideration, would not
have been written while some of the relatives described in it were
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother, for instance, would not have approved,'' he
said. ``Still, I hope I've written about the people I love with
compassion and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   He loves his house just as much. In ``Farewell,'' Foote
painstakingly details how it was built, the way light reflected
through windows on the lovingly polished floorboards. He wrote
about the trees in the back yard, and the nearby fields where he
and his friends romped before being called home to supper.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton has changed a lot since. Its sumpy surroundings have
fewer farms and more fast-food franchises. Some neighborhoods,
though not Foote's block, have the unmistakable air of genteel
decay.
</P>
<P>
   Even Foote's house isn't quite the same. It used to be painted
white. The canary-yellow color was selected by his late wife,
Lillian, a dozen years ago when the Footes decided to live there at
least part time.
</P>
<P>
   The house is inviting. Foote has decorated with sturdy, plain
New England furniture, and the walls are adorned with the stark
Puritan art associated with that region.
</P>
<P>
   Hallway walls are studded with framed movie posters (''The Trip
to Bountiful,'' ``Tender Mercies'') and an Andy Warhol minimalist
poster for ``1918'' that, Foote says, ``I liked but the producers
didn't, so it was not used.'' There are framed letters from
presidents. But taking pride of place are photographs of Foote's
children.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, bookshelves sag with old volumes dogeared from
constant use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes read a lot, and also like to spend time just
thinking,'' Foote said. ``It took me some time to realize that
thinking was part of my work. The reading is a pleasure. Recently,
I realized I had not read Jane Austen in some time, so I'm becoming
reacquainted with her now.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Foote enjoys being in his house, he rejoices in his
huge back yard, happily pointing out a huge pecan tree, some
colorful crape myrtles, a fig tree that stubbornly refuses to bear
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Although it would be easy enough anyway to find Foote in Wharton
_ his telephone number is listed in the city phone book _ the
canary-yellow house is a magnet for fans, who drop by at all hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come and say they just drove to Wharton on the chance
they might meet me,'' Foote said, shaking his silvery head.
``Recently, there were people from Wisconsin. That's a long way to
come on the chance I might be home. Fortunately, I was able to
visit with them. I try to be friendly when I can, though sometimes
I'm working and have to say I can't be disturbed. I'm always honest
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Constant disturbance was the main reason Foote couldn't live in
his hometown while most of his relatives were alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no concept of writing,'' he said. ``They felt they
could interrupt me anytime, so I worked better in New York. But
that's not a problem now.''
</P>
<P>
   An unlisted phone number would also reduce the number of current
calls or visits from strangers, but Foote won't consider getting
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be very pretentious,'' he said chuckling. ``I
couldn't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote's octogenarian days in his longtime home are built around
simple routine. He has a secretary who comes in at 9 in the
morning, and sometimes earlier; in the evenings, a woman cooks his
dinner. His days are still spent writing furiously, sometimes
obsessively.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when I'm writing that I stay up and work
through the night,'' Foote said, smiling shyly and sounding
confessional. ``I really do work all the time. I'm just back from
New Haven, where for two months a play of mine has been in
rehearsal. I'm working on a new play which was commissioned by a
New York theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote has been busy in the theater for more than 50 years.
``Farewell's'' last scene is in 1932, when Foote, then 17, leaves
Wharton to study acting in California. He later moves to New York,
where his gift for improvising dialogue in workshops leads to a
suggestion that he try his hand at script-writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote a one-act play with a part for myself, a critic came
and quite liked it, and said so,'' Foote says. ``I thought, `This
is how I'll establish myself as an actor, by writing material for
myself.' I came back here and wrote `Texas Town,' which was
produced in 1942. All of a sudden the desire to act just left me. I
wanted to write.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater critics embraced Foote's work. He made much of his
living, though, writing for the new medium of television. Perhaps
Foote's most successful effort was 1953's ``The Trip to
Bountiful,'' which he would eventually adapt for the theater, and,
three decades later, for film.
</P>
<P>
   Foote gained national prominence in 1962 when he won an Academy
Award for his screen adaptation of Harper Lee's novel ``To Kill a
Mockingbird.'' (Foote and the reclusive Lee remain close friends.)
He wrote other screenplays, including ``Baby, the Rain Must Fall,''
but during the 1970s he moved to a New Hampshire farm with his wife
and four children, and wrote very little until the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Foote re-emerged, winning his second screenplay Oscar
for ``Tender Mercies.'' He's been at full tilt ever since,
especially during his late-life Wharton homecoming, though he
paused again briefly seven years ago when his wife died. Horton
Foote and Lillian Vallish, a theater producer, were married for 48
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, you don't choose the ultimate direction of your
life,'' Foote said. ``It chooses you. I miss my wife terribly. I
always thought I would go first. We were happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you go on. This is what human beings do. I write about
people learning to do such things.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote's four grown children, two daughters and two sons, comfort
their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm blessed with my children,'' he said. ``So many people
better than I am, better intellectually, better PEOPLE, have
difficulties with their children. I don't. So I have them, and
since my wife has been gone, the writing has been a very sustaining
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Foote sleeps in the same small bedroom he occupied as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That somehow seems right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Except for the loss of his wife, the recent years have been good
to Horton Foote. He continues to write plays, and has finally
completed the nine-play ``The Orphan Cycle,'' which is based on his
father's life. In 1995, his play ``The Young Man From Atlanta'' won
the Pulitzer Prize for drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I won the Pulitzer Prize, I don't think people in Wharton
cared very much,'' Foote said grinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought the first Academy Award was pretty good. The
second time I got one of those they thought it was old news. And
they never seemed to care at all about the Emmys.''
</P>
<P>
   Wharton seems to care about Foote, but its residents don't make
a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wharton's good for me because the people here take me down to
size,'' he said. ``I think they like me generally, and would have
if I had never written a word.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote says he has no plans to slow down. There's a new play
commissioned by the New York theater; there may be a sequel to
``Farewell,'' which ends with the teen-aged Foote leaving Texas on
a bus for California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those first 17 years of my life that I wrote about were more
about the town and my family than me,'' he said. ``If I could write
a book, say, about the next 15 years of my life and somehow make it
more about the theater, I might do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his parlor, Foote tried to define his writing
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really am fascinated by the human condition,'' he said,
pausing to sip more tap water, his soft voice sounding like
wind-blown leaves rustling on the giant pecan tree in his yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of the things people are called on to go through
in their lives _ the losses of loved ones, frustrations with jobs,
trying hard to find ways to be happy _ I am moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I know all the faults of people, but on the whole human
beings are quite amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote summed up his own life succinctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I have been blessed,'' he said. ``No life is perfect.
If I had my way, my wife would still be here. But I have my work.
And this house. It's good here.''

   Q. I am 71 1/2 and have been retired for 10 years. My wife is
the same age. I have $150,000 in two separate IRA accounts, which
have been invested in bank CDs for the past 10 years, averaging 5
to 6 percent yields and currently in the neighborhood of 5 1/2
percent. Aside from Social Security of about $1,200 a month, we
have no other income. Can you suggest an investment where we might
earn more income, or income and growth?
</P>
<P>
   W.T., Lake Arrowhead, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The two goals you suggest are pretty much mutually exclusive.
For example, you'd have a pretty good shot at a solid dividend and
growth of your principal over the long haul if you invested in a
mutual fund that divides its portfolio between stocks and bonds and
other fixed-income investments. But to get that prospect of capital
growth, you would sacrifice yield.
</P>
<P>
   A good example of a fund in this category is Fidelity Puritan
fund, which has produced average annual total returns of 13.58
percent over the past decade. But since more than half of the
portfolio is invested in stocks, it would bring you a yield of only
3.1 percent, or $3,600 a year less than you're getting from the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, such a fund would represent a significant level of
risk, especially when compared with government-insured CDs. It's
true that you could invest in such a fund and gamble that it is
likely to average total returns in excess of 8 percent over the
long haul, and that you could therefore withdraw that 8 percent
annually, effectively drawing down both the fund's yield and some
of the anticipated gains in principal.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy would net you $3,750 a year in additional income
when compared to the CDs, but it's also fraught with danger.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose your fund encountered a sour market right at the outset,
with the fund losing 5 percent in each of the first two years; the
effect is that entering the third year your principal would be down
to $112,509, and you would henceforth require annual returns of
11.2 percent just to support the sequence of withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   This all may seem like a pretty gloomy approach to take, but
historically the stock market has delivered jolts of this sort to
overambitious investors many times.
</P>
<P>
   So a better approach would be to consider a straight
fixed-income portfolio, where your goal is to get a solid income
stream and to retain your principal, but without any prospect of
serious growth.
</P>
<P>
   For retirees I usually suggest a three-part portfolio,
representing the conservative, center, and higher-risk end of the
bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   If you used the Vanguard family of funds, for example, you might
start with 25 percent of your money in the Vanguard Short-Term
Corporate Bond fund, currently yielding 6.33 percent, then
establish a central position with 50 percent in Vanguard GNMA,
currently yielding 6.66 percent, and finishing with Vanguard
High-Yield Bond fund, which now yields 8.91 percent. Such a
portfolio would bring you a yield of $10,665 at current rates.
</P>
<P>
   Just as with the balanced fund, for that extra $2,415 a year in
income you will be facing a higher risk level than with the bank,
but if you look at these funds carefully you'll see that over the
very long term with such there is much shuffling up and down and
very little change.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a middle ground that you might explore. This would
be to put about $120,000 of your savings into a fixed-income
portfolio such as I proposed _ enough to give you the same income
stream that you now enjoy with the CDS. The other $30,000 could
then be invested in a fund such as Fidelity Puritan, which ought to
deliver solid principal growth over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 29 and are homeowners. We are making
extra mortgage payments every year to get our house paid off early.
We would like to retire comfortably at the age of 50. My wife
participates in her company's 401(k) plan, with her contributions
and the employer matches amounting to $700 a month. It is 60
percent invested in Fidelity Contrafund and the rest in one of the
Fidelity Equity-Income funds. I am self-employed and add $100 a
month to a SEP-IRA invested in Vanguard Growth and Income. I also
save $400 a month in taxable accounts invested in Vanguard Growth
and Income and Vanguard Index Growth. The taxable accounts are
designed to provide us with liquid funds to use until we reach age
59 1/2 and can tap into the tax-deferred savings without penalty.
We have been saving for about two years now, and have $60,000 in
these accounts. I also have 450 shares of Disney and 150 shares of
PepsiCo. Are we on the right track for retirement at age 50?
</P>
<P>
   M.R., Aliso Viejo, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You've set yourselves a pretty tough goal. While all of your
investments (including the two common stock positions) would grow
to $1,543,416 over 21 years, presuming continued contributions at
current levels and 10 percent average annual returns from the
portfolio, the number's not quite so impressive when we factor it
for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming average annual inflation at 3.5 percent for the next
21 years, that impressive sum would have the buying power of only
about $750,000 in today's money. If you invested all of the
retirement pool on the fixed-income side, it would provide you with
an income stream equivalent to about $48,000 in today's dollars _
less than your wife alone is now earning.
</P>
<P>
   And it gets worse. When you retire early, you not only have to
anticipate your income-stream needs but also establish a sizable
pool of money that can be left in the stock markets for growth, to
offset inflation during the later years of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier you retire, the more you will need to have in that
inflation-buffer account. Retiring at age 50, you might want as
much saved to protect you against inflation as you will need for
current income. So if you are following that thinking, what you'd
end up with is the equivalent of about $24,000 in current dollars,
which is hardly what most people would consider a comfortable
retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, some mitigating factors. If your wife
continues to save as a percentage of her earnings, every time she
gets a raise the contributions, and thus the expected accumulation,
will grow larger.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if you increase savings as your business prospers,
there will be further growth there as well. Nonetheless, you'll
have to decide for yourself what a comfortable level of income in
retirement will be, and then, using the inflation percentages I
have supplied, calculate how much more you will need to save to
reach your target.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I understand that there is a Massachusetts mutual fund that
is both federal and state tax-free. Can you give me the name and
address of the fund?
</P>
<P>
   N.D., Winchester, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. According to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., there are 79
mutual funds that invest in securities that are free of both
Massachusetts and federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, 11 are tax-free money market funds, 10 invest in
intermediate term municipal bonds, and the remaining 58 hold
general tax-free portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   The largest fund in each category, respectively, is Fidelity
Massachusetts Municipal Money Market, Boston 1784 Massachusetts
Tax-Exempt Income (an intermediate term fund), and Fidelity Spartan
Massachusetts Municipal fund.
</P>
<P>
   Call 800-544-8888 to reach Fidelity, or 800-BKB-1784 to reach
the 1784 group, which is managed by BankBoston. Or you could tap
the resources of a good public library and root through the other
76 funds in the category.

CURE-ALL GIVES RUSSIAN MAFIA A LEASE ON LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The gangland boss had a problem. He had more money than
he ever dreamed he would earn, an extravagant lifestyle and the
power and influence he needed to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, life had lost its meaning. Being a mafia chieftain
just wasn't fun anymore. So he went to see a shrink. . . .
</P>
<P>
   You think you've seen this movie? Well, analyze this: The scene
was Moscow, not New York; the mobster was the leader of one of
Russia's most feared crime gangs, not Robert De Niro; the
specialist he went to for help was Aron Belkin, psychoanalyst to
Russia's rich and infamous.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the wisecracking psychiatrist played by Billy Crystal in
``Analyze This,'' Belkin was not taken aback by his encounter with
a fearsome crime lord suffering from fits of self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Belkin has been analyzing that since the dawn of post-Communist
Russia's free-for-all market economy in 1992. Many of his clients
got rich quickly through illicit means. Plenty of them have been
violent, dangerous characters. But not in Belkin's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the doctor, my patients have to be afraid of me,'' said
Belkin, a timid-looking man with a tiny, raspy voice. ``I'm the
doctor, they have to respect me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not only do they respect him; they have spread the word.
Although he does not advertise, Russian biznesmeny have flocked to
Belkin's slightly dilapidated central Moscow office. Over the
years, Belkin has developed a theory _ and a cure _ for what ails
so many of his patients. He calls it ``money sickness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no idea what money was until the late 1980s,'' Belkin
said recently. ``Then suddenly, they became rich. Not just rich,
but they were getting money not only quickly, but easily. Suddenly
they were surrounded by diamonds and gold, and many of them could
not handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Their euphoria is soon replaced by fear of an early, violent
death, not unfounded given the high rate of contract killings among
Russian businessmen. ``The typical patient starts trying to get
money all kinds of illegal ways and then spend it in just as crazy
ways,'' Belkin said. ``His brain demands forbidden and extravagant
risks, whatever allows him to remove the alarm, to forget about his
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And the cure?
</P>
<P>
   ``The best treatment is to stop making money,'' Belkin said.
``We talk about what bothers them, and why. My advice is usually to
get out of business and go straight.''
</P>
<P>
   The mafia chieftain, for example, quit his ``job'' and went to
graduate school. Now he runs a legitimate business and lives
without fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works,'' Belkin said. ``That's why they come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But why don't they bust open his head when he tells them to stop
earning money? Belkin replies, ``I tell them to stop earning. They
get to keep what they already have.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If none of these problems existed in Soviet society, neither did
the cure. Until the late 1980s, psychoanalysis was officially
banned as a science too individualistic for Soviet collectivist
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Soviet Man did not need to be fixed,'' said Moscow
psychiatrist Dmitry Kraisner. ``He needed to be imitated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychiatric care,'' in Soviet practice, was often confused
with mental illness _ a misconception that survives to this day.
Soviet psychiatry also acquired a sinister function _ locking up
dissidents in mental hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But the regime was unable to stop the study and practice of
psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, I was an underground psychiatrist,'' Belkin said.
Belkin also wrote numerous works on psychology, which he has since
published.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. Moscow has seen a small boom in psychiatric
care, which is gradually becoming more accepted _ and more desired
_ among wealthier, worldlier Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Belkin turns away more patients than he accepts, letting his
competitors pick up the extra business. Unlike some of his
patients, Belkin has not let the chance to make money change his
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like writing books,'' he said. ``I'm happy with what I
have.''

KOSOVO'S GYPSIES: USED BY SERBS, HATED BY ALBANIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT

   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ Every morning, the Gypsy grave digger made
his rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Driving a garbage truck through this town's ravaged streets,
Jevded Mazreco would go about the gruesome task of collecting
bodies of people slaughtered by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Mazreco says he buried more than 300 murdered ethnic Albanians
during Serbia's methodical three-month campaign of ethnic
cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would bury 15 here and 12 there,'' he said. ``They made us
do this. It was either dig the graves, or die.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gypsies of Kosovo, or Rom, as they call themselves, said
they were forced laborers for the Yugoslav Army, police, and
paramilitary units that rampaged through Kosovo. Now the Gypsies
are labeled collaborators by the Kosovo Liberation Army and have
become the focus of brutal revenge by KLA troops and returning
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   With Serbian forces withdrawn and many Serb civilians fleeing,
the Gypsies are the ones left behind to blame. Hundreds of Gypsies
who tried to escape to Serbia were sent back to Kosovo by Serb
border officials. It seems once again Europe's Gypsies are caught
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   It is the history of the Rom. In this conflict, and in wars and
campaigns of terror over the centuries, Gypsies have been forced to
choose sides to live. In this war as in many others, the Gypsies
have chosen the wrong one. But their role may also hold a key to
their survival.
</P>
<P>
   They know where the bodies are buried.
</P>
<P>
   Mazreco pulled hard on a hand-rolled cigarette as he pointed to
several large mounds of earth on the fringes of a Muslim cemetery
and said, ``I buried an entire family there, at least 12 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators for the International Criminal Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia, located in the Hague, which is seeking to
collect evidence to support the indictment of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and others, have interviewed Mazreco at length.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what it was like to pick up the bodies of children
and whole families?'' he asked. ``Do you think anyone would do this
if they were not forced to?''
</P>
<P>
   The father of six children said he mostly hides in his home now,
fearing that he will be labeled a collaborator and killed. He
insisted he was never paid for his grisly labor.
</P>
<P>
   He was simply told where to collect the bodies by the head of
the Prizren Public Works Department, Jova Vanovic, and the local
head of the feared Ministry of Interior Police, Petrovic Jakovic,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   This, investigators said, is an example of how Gypsies could
provide crucial insight to not just the location of mass graves,
but an understanding of the Serbian chain of command in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, Mazreco, 45, had worked for several years as a
laborer in the Public Works Department. He mostly collected garbage
and occasionally dug graves.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mazreco was paid $20 a month for his work. But during the
war, he said, he was not given a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Works offical ``Vanovic told me my payment was that I
would not be killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the weeks of slaughter and the nights of heavy NATO air
raids, Mazreco said, he would hear the Serbian officials gathering
at the Public Works Department garage joking about the use of a
garbage truck to dispose of the ethnic Albanian victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried when I saw those poor people who had been killed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But ethnic Albanians do not buy the tears.
</P>
<P>
   Nejar Betuca, 50, an ethnic Albanian refugee who had just
returned from living three months in a refugee camp to find his
home burned and looted, burst his way into the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just as responsible as the Serbs. They are
collaborators,'' he said, pointing a finger at Mazreco and three
other Gypsies standing in the Public Works Department lot filled
with broken tractors, smashed cars, and old trucks. Betuca was
there looking for his stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   ``They guided the paramilitaries to our homes to kill us and
then they stole everything we owned,'' said Betuca, being held back
from the Gypsies by a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Many ethnic Albanians haven't held back in attacking Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Five Gypsies were found killed in a field last week in the
village of Obilic by NATO forces who theorized that they had been
branded collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   On June 18, German NATO troops found 25 KLA fighters who had
taken 15 elderly Gypsies to the Interior Ministry building in
Prizren for allegedly looting the homes of ethnic Albanians. One
Gypsy was found dead with his hands chained to a chair. The others,
most of whom were chained to radiators, said they were beaten and
told they would be executed before the peacekeeping troops raided
the building and disarmed the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the reigns of conquering empires, from the Ottomans
to the Hapsburgs to the Nazis, the Gypsies have been persecuted and
forced to keep moving in a diaspora that stretches from Russia to
Spain to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 Yugoslav census puts the number of Rom in Kosovo at
35,000 out of a total of 1.4 million. As in other European
countries, they live on the margins of society, cobbling an
existence out of day labor and street peddling. They are a closed
society with a deep mistrust of the ``gadge,'' or ``outsiders,'' as
they refer to all non-Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Gypsies move quickly out of war zones. During the
Bosnian war, most Bosnian Gypsies moved into Serbia; their caravans
lined the Danube River. But the NATO airstrikes knocked out bridges
and trapped many inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a ramshackle Gypsy village near Obelic, Fehmi Haliti, 46,
fearfully peered through a crack in a door newly reinforced with
corrugated tin before finally coming outside with a friend who held
a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   He is a local leader of the Rom community and explained that the
Gypsies of Kosovo have two divided cultures, one speaks Albanian
and one Serbian. The chiefs of these two different Gypsy clans were
represented at the peace talks in Rambouillet before the
negotiations collapsed and led to war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the story of the Rom. We have always had to survive in
the middle of conflict. We will survive again, and we will move on
when we can. But now people are just trying to stay alive,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating how the Gypsies exist within conflict, the grave
digger Mazreco was busy last Thursday burying the body of an
80-year-old Serb man who died of an apparent heart attack when KLA
soldiers kicked in the door of his home.
</P>
<P>
   A UN official who arranged the funeral said the Gypsies were the
only ones they could find to dig a grave for a Serb.

HOSPITALS TAKING A HIT FROM MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX AND AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON -- For a midsummer Friday night at Boston Medical
Center's emergency room, the city's busiest, it's unusually quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, chief resident Peter Weimersheimer ministers to 30
patients during his nine-hour shift _ crash victims, cases of hand
trauma, pneumonia sufferers, patients in psychiatric crisis, and
end-stage alcoholics, such as a 45-year-old vodka addict who says
he's been vomiting ``cups'' of blood but resists being admitted for
a complete workup until Weimersheimer explains that he is
``probably going to die'' if he doesn't stay.
</P>
<P>
   For his labors, Weimersheimer earns $15 an hour, about half what
he used to get as a carpenter and $5.37 short of a third-year
Boston Medical Center nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little dismayed at all the talk about cutting residents
when we're such a cheap source of labor for hospitals,''
Weimersheimer says. ``There's no way they could hire enough
attending physicians to replace us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting residents? It's hard to imagine at a time when Boston's
teaching hospitals are often full to the gunnels and nearly all of
them routinely have trouble finding a bed for one more patient.
</P>
<P>
   But these are no ordinary times. The outlook at the nation's
premier hospitals _ those, like Boston Medical Center and a dozen
others in the Boston area that train doctors and deal with
difficult cases _ is the darkest in memory, with no clear way back
to the light.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no plan to lay off interns and residents, who
have hospital commitments to complete three- and four-year training
programs, leaders of academic medicine expect to pare training
slots in the future. But other hospital jobs are in jeopardy as
teaching hospitals struggle to maintain what they call their unique
mission to train the next generations of physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General are
eliminating a total of 240 jobs to stem a joint operating loss of
$14.1 million for the first half of this year. That's a little more
than a third of the $39 million operating loss suffered by their
parent, Partners HealthCare, New England's largest hospital system.
(With investment income and other revenue, the system saw a net
profit of $2.4 million, compared to $30.4 million a year ago.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working our butts off and still losing money,'' said Dr.
Laurence Ronan, a staff doctor at Massachusetts General. ``We can't
continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, things are
even shakier. The institution has lost $38 million on operations so
far this year, and BI Deaconess is a much smaller operation than
Partners. ``We're scrambling behind the scenes to protect our
medical training programs,'' said Dr. Steven Weinberger, the
hospital's director of medical education.
</P>
<P>
   In Worcester, UMass Memorial Health Care has closed programs and
cut staff to trim $60 million in annual costs, and are still losing
money so far this year. To break even next year, officials say they
need to slash $70 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Can there be any doubt that hospitals are in trouble, especially
the teaching hospitals that are the undisputed crown jewels of US
health care?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are plenty of doubts, especially in Washington,
where the leaders of Boston health care are pinning their hopes for
a congressional reprieve from their fiscal difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics don't doubt that hospitals are losing money. But they
do question why, how bad it will get, and whether it's the federal
government's responsibility to do anything about it. And it's not
just fiscally conservative Republicans raising the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar is high, and we're not going to just go and give money
away because people say they're experiencing hardship,'' said
Daniel Mendelson, the senior health policy official in the White
House budget office. Despite the hospitals' complaints, ``we don't
see the systemic evidence that one might like to see before doing
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Clinton seems ready to support an idea that
would make the hospitals' hunt for money even harder. He is
expected to propose giving Medicare beneficiaries broad new
coverage for prescription drugs, a potentially costly idea that,
whatever its social merits, might siphon funds that could otherwise
go to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Congress agrees to boost health care spending overall,
Clinton's proposal ``would be very damaging'' to hospitals, said
Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dilemma has roots in act of Congress &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals didn't arrive at their current dilemma overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders blame their troubles on an act of Congress, the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which imposed the deepest cuts on
Medicare in the federal program's 35-year history. But there is
broad consensus among industry analysts that the hospitals' current
state resulted from forces set in motion early in this decade. The
problem is a complicated amalgam of:
</P>
<P>
   --Inadvertent Medicare overpayments, especially for inpatient
care;
</P>
<P>
   --The 1994 collapse of the Clinton health reform plan, which
many view as a lost opportunity to rationalize funding of teaching
hospitals' social missions;
</P>
<P>
   --A post-1994 unleashing of market forces in health care that
permitted managed care plans to extract deep discounts from
hospitals desperate to keep patients flowing their way.
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile for the drift to become clear to hospitals, some
observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1994 and 1997, things were looking pretty damn good
for teaching hospitals, and their Medicare profit margins were
especially good,'' said Dr. David Altman of the Lewin Group, a
health care consulting firm. ``There were some Cassandras saying
the sky was going to fall, but not everybody was listening during a
boom period.''
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, the Medicare overpayments seem especially striking
_ and unlikely to continue indefinitely at a time when bankruptcy
was forecast by 2008 for Medicare's Part A trust fund, which pays
for hospital care.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this decade, US teaching hospitals were
making $7 in ``profit'' for every $100 it cost them to provide
inpatient care to a Medicare patient, according to a recent
analysis by Stuart Guterman of the Urban Institute, a
Washington-based think tank. By contrast, community hospitals were
losing almost an equal amount on each Medicare patient in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Medicare profit margins for inpatient care at teaching
hospitals had ballooned to 28.4 percent, and nonteaching hospitals
were making a 12.4 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   The largesse stemmed from formulas built into federal law that
automatically update Medicare hospital payments to keep pace with
inflation. But hospital costs flattened in the 1990s, instead of
climbing steadily as the formulas assumed they would. ``Medicare
was a missile just cruising along with no controls,'' observed Dr.
Thomas O'Donnell, chief executive of New England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals point out that they lost money on Medicare outpatient
care. Outpatient margins dropped to a negative 12 percent in 1996,
and fell further to nearly twice that in 1998, according to the
American Hospital Association. But hospitals' total margins
remained in the black throughout the first seven years of the
decade, according to Guterman's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare overpayment on the inpatient side handed hospitals a
timely opportunity in the 1990s, although hospital executives don't
like to admit it. It allowed them to bid low for all-important
contracts with managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to hold onto market share they've cut very low-priced
deals with managed-care companies,'' said Stuart Altman, a Brandeis
University professor who served on a congressional Medicare reform
commission. This implicit Medicare subsidy of private insurers is
``an unfair and unsustainable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that hospitals have been caring for privately
insured patients at less than their actual costs, that has left
them especially vulnerable to erosion in Medicare payments. ``They
knew that Medicare was paying above costs, and you can say, `well,
they should have been prepared for this,' '' said Katharine London,
chief of policy development at the Massachusetts Division of Health
Care Finance and Policy. ``But they're in a very competitive
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Stuart Altman: ``I've been saying (to managed-care
executives) for some time that the only way they have been able to
squeeze down hospital payments is that hospitals have been filling
their pockets from Medicare. Will they be as successful if Medicare
cuts back?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Balanced budget a blow to teaching hospitals &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Medicare has cut back _ with a vengeance, some would say.
</P>
<P>
   As the name implies, Congress intended the Balanced Budget Act
of 1997 to balance the federal budget. With considerable help from
a booming economy, it did _ four years ahead of schedule, and with
spending cuts mostly derived from Medicare. Moreover, the law has
helped to postpone the day when Medicare's hospital trust fund will
run out of money to 2015, buying time for more systematic reform.
Or perhaps buying time to do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals are disproportionately affected by the BBA
because their older, sicker caseload makes them far more dependent
on Medicare than other hospitals. Medicare accounts for at least
half of a typical teaching hospital's inpatient revenues. In
addition, teaching hospitals are apt to have more Medicaid and
uninsured patients.

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... uninsured patients.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The upshot is that revenue from treating privately insured
patients provides much less of a financial cushion for teaching
hospitals when Medicare cuts its payments.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the BBA decreed a 29 percent reduction between 1998
and 2002 in Medicare payments for ``indirect medication
education.'' These funds are intended to cover Medicare's share of
the special costs of being a teaching hospital _ not interns' and
residents' salaries, which come out of a separate fund, but the
amorphous expenses associated with having sicker patients, more
technology, and trainees involved in patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Medicare payments, these so-called IME funds had also
risen sharply in the 1990s, from $2.5 billion in 1990 to $4.6
billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When it was passed, the BBA was expected to cut Medicare
spending by $115 billion over what it would otherwise have been.
But in the first year and a half of the new regime, the slowdown in
Medicare spending ``was greater than expected,'' Gail Wilensky,
chairwoman of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission told the
Senate Finance Committee this month.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way the law is phased in, the deepest cuts have
not yet occurred. By hospital industry estimates, the BBA will cut
as much as $220 billion from Medicare spending between 1998 and
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress overshot the mark by almost double,'' said Thomas A.
Scully, chief executive of the Federation of American Health
Systems, whose members include for-profit hospitals. ``Congress did
not vote for $220 billion. Congress didn't intend that.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Congress could never have foreseen some of the reasons
why Medicare is spending so much less than expected. A good deal of
it, analysts said, is due to more scrupulous billing by hospitals _
an apparent reaction to the Clinton administration's campaign
against fraudulent billing and ``upcoding,'' in which providers
jack up reimbursement by billing for a more severe illness than
patients actually have. In this light, Medicare hospital payments
are now more in line with the true cost of serving patients.
</P>
<P>
   Taken by themselves, the 1997 Medicare changes will cut total
profit margins of hospitals by two percentage points by 2002, from
6.7 percent _ the highest point in 17 years _ to a relatively
healthy 4.7 percent, according to Guterman, who spent a decade as
deputy director of the federal agency that advises Congress on
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   However, if managed-care insurers continue to wring payment
concessions out of hospitals at recent rates, total hospital profit
margins could fall to 1.5 percent by 2002. Guterman called that ``a
very low margin that would pressure a considerable number of
hospitals.'' But, he pointed out, ``It looks like Medicare by
itself isn't a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   This analysis is gaining currency in Washington, adding to the
hospitals' burden as they lobby for a rollback _ or at least a
``pause'' _ in the BBA's Medicare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   When a delegation of Boston hospital executives visited the
capital recently, they got a reality check from Donna Shalala, the
US secretary of health and human services. ``Shalala's attitude
was: `The reason you guys are having trouble is that you negotiated
bad deals with HMOs, gave them too many discounts, and Medicare is
making up the difference,' '' said New England Medical Center's
O'Donnell, who was in the group.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Representative Peter Stark of California, the senior
Democrat on the Medicare subcommittee in the House, suggests that
hospitals look to private insurers, not Medicare, for more money.
Stark recently asked government auditors to investigate the source
of hospitals' financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, are Medicare fee-for-service payments
becoming just another way that we funnel money to the nation's HMOs
to ensure their profits?'' Stark wrote to the General Accounting
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such doubts, some on Capitol Hill think hospitals have a
shot at wringing limited relief out of Congress this year. To that
end, the American Hospital Association is waging what its policy
chief, Carmela Coyle, calls the largest lobbying campaign in
memory. Senators from states with large clusters of teaching
hospitals are on board, including Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy,
Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, Democrat of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good chance we'll get a bill this year that will put
some money back into Indirect Medical Education,'' said one senate
staffer. ``The academic medical centers have got themselves
organized in a way I've not seen in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if they succeed in this stopgap effort, the Mass.
Generals and Beth Israels and Mt. Sinais know they need to win a
much bigger debate if their teaching mission is to be secured in a
market-driven world. They need reliable support, on a broader base
than Medicare, for the costs of training the physicians of the
future. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Apprenticeship comes with a high price tag &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need good doctors and, therefore, everybody ought to
pay to train them,'' said Dr. David Blumenthal, director of MGH's
Institute of Health Policy. ``But we also need good lawyers, good
engineers, and good plumbers, and we don't have a public program to
train them.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, Blumenthal argues, is consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We allow lawyers to practice law immediately out of law
school, but we don't allow doctors to do that,'' he noted. ``We
require doctors to have minimum amounts of real-world experience.
Somebody has to pay for that apprenticeship.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical students pay tuition _ lots of it. (Weimersheimer, the
Boston Medical Center resident, is carrying $160,000 in medical
school debt.) After graduation, the newly minted physicians
subsidize the cost of their obligatory apprenticeship by taking
hospital training posts that pay $15 an hour _ or less _ for
60-hour workweeks _ or more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anyone who doubts the cost of residency training should
follow Team D on its morning rounds on MGH's Bigelow Building
medical wards.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Yiming Zhao, a second-year resident, launches the morning
routine at 8:15, accompanied by a half-dozen white-coated medical
students, interns, and residents. Meticulously reviewing each
patient's situation, they troop in and out of 17 rooms,
interviewing, poking, prodding, and consulting with each other on
the medical puzzles they encounter.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:25, Team D gathers over crullers and coffee in a
windowless conference room with two ``attendings,'' senior staff
physicians who go over each case, consider the possibilities, offer
advice. Then they all head off for more bedside consultations.
</P>
<P>
   It results in some of the best care anywhere, as well as
rigorous training, but no time-and-motion expert would call it the
most efficient way to take care of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Even less cost-effective _ but increasingly important in the
training of tomorrow's doctors _ is the clinical training that Dr.
Jeffrey Schnipper is just completing. After each patient interview,
Schnipper consults with his supervisor, Dr. John D. Goodson, and
the two of them then interview the patient together. From the way
his patients react to Schnipper's news that he is moving on to a
different training phase this month, it's clear they value the time
and attention they've had from the 28-year-old resident.
</P>
<P>
   But the examining room Schnipper occupies for the afternoon
could be more profitably used by a senior doctor who could see more
patients and bill for each encounter. Neither Medicare nor any
other agency _ and certainly not private insurers _ explicitly pay
for outpatient training. And practicing doctors are feeling so
pressured to see more patients in less time that it's hard to
recruit them for proctoring duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to move to a new system in which graduate medical
education is explicitly recognized and funded by all payers,''
Goodson says. ``It really is for the greater good.''
</P>
<P>
   There's widespread agreement that a better way is needed, but no
consensus on what it might be. All concur that the teaching
hospitals' ultimate goal _ a so-called all-payer system in which
private and government payers contribute a small tax to support
physician training _ will be an uphill political battle. That fight
won't even begin until after the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teaching hospitals will have to find their own ways
to sustain the academic enterprise while they compete for patients
and haggle with private insurers for higher payment rates. Somehow
they will, because anything else is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching is how we maintain our preeminence in the world,''
said MGH's Laurence Ronan. ``If we dismantle this system, it will
take 30 or 40 years to put it back together again.''

AN ANSWER TO THE TENNIS CALL CONTROVERSY? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've ever seen a John McEnroe or Venus Williams temper
tantrum on the tennis court, you know that the accuracy of umpires'
line calls is often a controversial topic in professional tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Have a little sympathy for the umpires: Judging whether a 2
5/8-inch felt ball moving up to 110 m.p.h. made a thousandth of a
second's worth of contact with a two-inch stripe on the ground has
to be one of life's more difficult challenges.
</P>
<P>
   For years, inventors have been working on systems that would
automate the process, and some are in use in major tournaments.
Earlier this month, a small, five-year-old Sudbury, Mass. company
that has done sonar work for the US Navy won a patent for its own
system that it thinks could be much less expensive and more
reliable than others on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph R. Fisher, president of Signal Processing Systems, and
colleagues William C. Booth of Stow, Mass. and Francis E. McInnis
of Marlborough, Mass. won patent 5,908,361 for an ``automated
tennis line calling system.''
</P>
<P>
   One key innovation in Fisher's system is that it combines
wafer-thin coaxial wire sensors in the tape that marks the playing
area with a system of microphones mounted around the court. A
computer evaluates the unique sound characteristic of a ball
hitting the ground to determine where the ball bounced. That helps
filter out false sensor readings from the impacts of players' feet
or racquets.
</P>
<P>
   The system also includes sensors that reveal whether a ball hit
the top of the net _ a ``let'' that requires the server to serve
again _ and it can be used to chart where serves and shots landed
as an aid to trainers and sportscasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linesmen do a remarkably good job, but basically, they're
trying to do something that can't humanly be done,'' Fisher said of
the challenge to consistently judge whether a shot was in or out.
With the huge prizes offered in major tournaments, ``There's a lot
of money at stake potentially'' in getting calls right.
</P>
<P>
   One existing system, called Cyclops, uses light beams projected
along the back of the service box to judge whether serves were in
or out. Major tournaments including the US Open, Wimbledon and the
Australian and Italian national tournaments use it as a complement
to human officials.
</P>
<P>
   However, to avoid being set off by a player's foot, Cyclops must
be immediately turned off after each serve. And the cost of leasing
it typically runs to $20,000 per court for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Fisher is optimistic that once he gets enough
investors to help fund mass-manufacturing of his system, it could
be purchased outright for the same $20,000, declining to as little
as $3,000 a court once it could be produced in volume. And it could
reduce the expense of hiring and training as many as 11 officials
watching lines around the court in pro matches.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's company has installed prototypes for testing at the
Longwood Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill, Mass. and at Cape Cod
Academy in Osterville, Mass., and had US Tennis Association judges
up to the Cape two years ago to run tests. The only visible
difference is a small electronics box the size of a hardback book
mounted on the net post, plus tiny microphones in the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The USTA director of officials, Rich Kaufman, said he found
Fisher's system interesting, but cautioned: ``There have been
probably 6 to 8 major attempts to make a system like this, and most
of these systems have failed miserably.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much in its infancy, and they've come across so many
problems, that we're still pretty far away from getting to a
situation where we would then have the discussion of,
philosophically, do we think we should replace human beings with
machines?'' Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher acknowledges that ``not everybody thinks it would be good
for the game of tennis to have a computer call the lines.'' But he
thinks skeptics can be won over or persuaded to use it to
complement human eyes. Ultimately, he thinks, a big market might be
at tennis clubs where casual players might prefer trusting a
machine rather than their opponent's honor when it comes to
deciding whether their shot was in or out.

DOCUMENTARY TAKES ON A LOADED TOPIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS: GUNS IN AMERICA 
Anchored by: Bill Kurtis 
On: A &AMP; E 
Time: Monday through Friday, 9 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By late April, Bill Kurtis and four producers on A &AMP; E's
``Investigative Reports'' were wrapping up a year of work on an
ambitious, weeklong documentary series on the gun culture in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Then fresh proof of that culture's pervasiveness erupted at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. When the shooting
stopped, 15 lay dead, the national gun debate had been rekindled,
and Kurtis and company had some editing to do.
</P>
<P>
   But while the shadow of Columbine lies across ``Guns in
America,'' and while the terrible toll of gun violence is a major
theme, the series does not begin on an anti-gun note, and
throughout strains for evenhandedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to really give the gun owners their day in court,''
Kurtis said in a phone interview from Chicago, where
``Investigative Reports'' is produced. ``They feel under siege by
the government and the media. We wanted to really understand why
they love their guns so much, and why it's such a part of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   There is now a ``great divide'' on the gun issue, according to
Kurtis, with the National Rifle Association on one side and
middle-class soccer moms on the other. The split is in part
geographical, he said, with pro-gun passions highest in the West
and in rural areas, and antipathy toward guns strongest in cities
and suburbs. In rural communities, said Kurtis, ``people feel the
gun is their constitutional right, while in urban areas, people say
`This is so unreasonable and insane; how could these people be
feeling this in the face of Columbine?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtis said it became clear from interviews with NRA members
that the hardline anti-gun-control position espoused by NRA
leadership does not fully reflect the views of the membership.
``They don't feel as strongly as the leadership does about holding
the line; the guys down the line would be willing to help solve the
problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with ``Guns in America,'' the 9 p.m. time slot on A &AMP; E
will be occupied from now on by documentaries under the
``Investigative Reports'' banner. A &AMP; E executives clearly hope the
documentaries will firm up the channel's identity. Within an
increasingly crowded cable universe, the 15-year-old A &AMP; E faces
the challenge of establishing a niche broader than simply the home
of ``Biography.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kurtis, the anchor and executive producer of ``Investigative
Reports,'' the task of filling five prime-time hours per week is a
mixed blessing. ``It's every journalist's dream to choose your own
stories and spend as long as you want on them,'' he said. ``On the
other hand, it uses up every spare second I have.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A prescient choice &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the ``Investigative Reports'' team began considering topics
for its kickoff series a year ago, Kurtis said, ``we thought of
drugs and education and things like that, but chose guns, figuring
that somewhere along the line something would come up and make it
newsworthy. And then, of course, Columbine hit.''
</P>
<P>
   With memories of the carnage so vivid, the Columbine context may
color some viewers' response to the gun enthusiasists depicted in
Part 1.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging from Texas to Nevada to Michigan, ``Guns in America''
explores the tradition of gun use for hunting and sport (and
refrains from mocking even those gun aficionados who appear
on-screen in pseudo-cowboy Wild West garb). ``Guns in America''
lends a sympathetic ear to those who argue that guns are sometimes
necessary for self-defense, especially for women.
</P>
<P>
   The fervor of some gun owners is exemplified by a woman who
continues to own the very gun factory where her 21-year-old son was
killed in an accident. She blames his death not on guns but on his
failure to follow safety precautions.
</P>
<P>
   But there are cooler heads making cogent pro-gun arguments in
``Guns in America,'' such as University of Chicago professor John
Lott. He notes that guns are used defensively 2 million times a
year in the United States, and describes how his attitude toward
guns changed when his research found that states with ``right to
carry'' firearms laws have lower rates of violent crime than other
states.
</P>
<P>
   Those security arguments are balanced by the Wednesday
installment, which takes viewers inside Chicago's Cook County
Hospital emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the statistics _ 22,000 gun deaths in the United States
last year, one person shot every two minutes _ acquire a human
face. Teenagers, their bodies torn by bullets, writhe in agony on
blood-soaked sheets _ and they're the lucky ones who lived.
</P>
<P>
   Three women, close friends, wrenchingly describe the pain of
losing sons to handgun violence within two years of one another.
What is so chilling is how casually their sons' killers pulled the
triggers, how easy guns make it to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guns are ending up in the hands of children,'' says a
nurse, who also lost a child to gun violence. ``As long as it's
happening in the black community, as long as it's happening in the
Hispanic community, it's not (seen as) that important.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Kurtis said there are nearly 240 million guns
in America, with more pouring onto the streets every day, thanks to
gun manufacturers intent on finding ways to maintain a revenue
stream that accounts for more than $1 billion a year. For instance,
Kurtis interviewed a gun maker who explained how he got around bans
on assault rifles simply by not appending a ``flash suppressor'' to
the front of the barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtis said he came away from the ``Guns in America'' project
believing that gun-control efforts will always face an uphill
battle because so many Americans are simply not willing to give up
their weapons, in part due to distrust of the government. But he
tempered that prediction by noting that, as with the tobacco
industry, gun makers face unprecedented new legal challenges now
that big-city mayors are lining up to file class-action lawsuits
against them.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that in the post-Columbine climate, all the
usual bets regarding gun control may be off. ``The Littleton group,
the housewife group, they are going to take over,'' said Kurtis.
``And that is what the NRA should be afraid of.''

   FLOOD: Several inches of rain pound the Kansas City area Sunday
and Monday. Streams pour out of their banks, intersections flood,
areas around Southwest Boulevard, 16th and Washington in Kansas
City, Kan., are evacuated, power outages reported and rescues
abound. Missouri Water Patrol called out to search for a 7-year-old
child at Woods Chapel Road and Mill Drive at the entrance to Lake
Tapawingo. Stuff reportedly is floating out of homes in Kansas
City, Kan. And more rain is on the way this week. Before Monday,
Kansas City already was 10 inches above average rainfall for the
year and three inches above for the month. Also rainfall ratings

A COMING-OUT PARTY FOR MYSTERY AND CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I write this on the first day of summer, a moment of almost
ritualistic ushering-in, of waking up to the new, of putting the
academic year behind me (for I am, after all, one who works to the
rhythms of ``the school year''). At such a moment I have always
liked to devote myself to first novels, debuts of writers who have
newly offered themselves up for critical appraisal and to the gods
of the marketplace. Will their books sell? Will the dream of being
a novelist, of living by wits and words, begin well? Perhaps
reviewers can never escape the urge to play Pygmalion. To help
launch a career, to smash all hopes _ what arrogant notions of
power the reviewer may entertain. For myself, I prefer only good
news, so here are eight first novels about which the news is
largely good.
</P>
<P>
   Three of these debuts hew closely to recipes that have been
proven so consistently successful that merely getting the cake to
rise again may be considered a triumph. Formula one:
Turn-and-turn-again _ cast suspicion (with suspicion's companion,
fear) repeatedly, alternatively, logically, on a tiny cast of
characters. Jonathan Stone works with this formula brilliantly in
``The Cold Truth'' (St. Martin's, $23.95). Julian Palmer is chosen
by the legendary Winston ``Bear'' Edwards, chief of police in an
upstate New York snow-belt town, to work with him in a training
program. As he shambles toward retirement, the chief has on his
desk one unsolved case, the brutal murder and dismemberment of a
young waitress; otherwise his record is perfect. Until Palmer
arrives, the chief doesn't know that his new associate is a woman.
The two work together in alternating trust and distrust, and the
chief also enlists the services of a well-known local psychic.
Stone takes this mix, follows the recipe, and gives us a compelling
tale true to all the expectations of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   Formula two: Suggest there is a monstrous conspiracy that, if
its roots are revealed, will launch upon the world a disaster so
horrible one may be given only hints of it. Catch an attractive
innocent up in the conspiracy, make him an unwitting pawn in a game
he does not even know he is playing. Give him the support of an old
girlfriend. Stalk him with an eerie professional killer, or perhaps
two, who pursue our innocent and his friend down the rural roads of
America (in this case, to Mississippi via North Carolina) while a
hacker friend discovers information that even the most powerful man
in the world appears to be unable to suppress. Make sure the
chilling professional killers are, when it comes to it, remarkably
incompetent. Few cooks can make this mixture read to truly frantic
purpose, but Russell Andrews, in ``Gideon'' (Ballantine, $24.95),
serves it up with aplomb. (Nothing is ever as it seems in this
literature: Andrews is a ``first-time writer,'' but he is also
Peter Gethers and David Handler, who between them have written a
score of novels.)
</P>
<P>
   Formula three: Wed ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' to this week's
headlines. In ``Cleopatra's Needle'' (Forge, $23.95), Steven
Siebert tells us the tale of the world-famous archeologist at the
Metropolitan Museum of New York who sends an assistant to find a
broken Egyptian ankh in the musuem's storage collection, unleashing
untold mayhem. The assistant disappears and turns up murdered at
the foot of Cleopatra's Needle in Central Park. Meanwhile, as the
dust jacket summarizes, ``Jacinda El-Bahri, a Mossad agent, is
running for her life in Cairo after stealing the other half of the
ankh from a powerful terrorist. Known as Salameh, he plans to use
the relic's incredible energy to unleash a power of biblical
proportions.'' For people who like this sort of stuff, this is
definitely the sort of stuff they will like: Siebert dishes up his
startling nonsense with great charm.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one wants to escape from formulaic fiction every now
and then, and Meira Cook's ``The Blood Girls'' (Overlook, $22.95)
provides wonderful relief from the allegedly unexpected twists and
turns of the manipulative plot. The opening sentence certainly drew
me in: ``Seven days before Easter Monday, in a small town north of
Winnipeg, Manitoba, an eleven-year-old girl sitting in her
classroom began to bleed from the palm of her left hand.'' The
story that follows, probing a small town's response to the
miraculous, is (we are told) reconstructed from interviews,
newspaper articles, journal entries, letters, and memory. Its
central characters _ a priest, a doctor, a journalist, and Molly
Rhutabaga, who has lived in the same house all her life _ are
wonderfully real. I truly hope we will hear much more from Cook, a
South African transplanted to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   I feel the same excitement about Leslie Forbes, whose ``Bombay
Ice'' I missed in hardcover a year ago and now debuts in paper
(Bantam, $13.95). This is the story of a British journalist who is
called to Bombay by her sister, whose film-director husband is
suspected of murdering his ex-wife. The book is self-consciously
rich in detail, complex where Cook is simple, given to meditation
on alchemy, death, and sexuality _ and despite all this, amply
rewards the reader wanting an exotic locale and a plot to sink the
teeth into. More, please!
</P>
<P>
   Members of our legal fraternity seem increasingly dissatisfied
with the messy nature of their day jobs and are turning to lawyerly
novels where everything can be made to come out right. ``A
Cinderella Affidavit'' (Forge, $25.95) by Michael Frederickson,
general counsel to the Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers (which
looks into cases of wrongdoing by lawyers), draws upon his
expertise for a cunning story of crime, corruption, perjury, and
murder in Boston. ``Big Easy Backroad'' (St. Martin's, $22.95) is
by Martin Hegwood, a former assistant district attorney now working
for the Mississippi secretary of state's office. He gives us Jack
Delmas, a freelance investigator who helps a barmaid look for her
missing boyfriend and quickly discovers that New Orleans is steamy
even when air-conditioned. Both these books are well-above-average
hammock reading.
</P>
<P>
   We stay in the sultry Southland with Darryl Wimberley's ``A Rock
and a Hard Place'' (St. Martin's, $22.95), which introduces Barrett
Raines, a black detective in a small town in Florida's Panhandle.
He faces the usual gumbo of racism, family ties, small-town gossip,
and bottle-on-the-counter taverns _ but Wimberley puts all this
together very well, ushering in summer with just the right mix of
mystery, chilled beer, and doubt that we will ever get cool again.

THE JOYS AND PERILS OF A LOVE AFFAIR WITH SOCCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE MIRACLE OF CASTEL DI SANGRO 
By Joe McGinniss 
Little, Brown, 407 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early on in ``The Miracle of Castel di Sangro,'' Joe McGinniss
is explaining his raison d'etre to the local capo, who also happens
to own the soccer team McGinniss will be following.
</P>
<P>
   McGinniss explains that he has forfeited a $1 million fee to
write a book about ``Mr. O. J. Simpson'' in order to spend a season
in the hills of Abruzzo, researching the story of an obscure
village's giant-killing team. The capo apparently decides that
anyone deranged enough to refuse such a lucrative offer should be
left to pursue his caprice.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, McGinniss has been similarly indulged by his agent,
publisher, family, and friends in recent years. Maybe they realized
that some outlandish acts have been committed in the world of
soccer, and that for McGinniss to relinquish $1 million to follow
the sport makes him one of the more reasonable ``tifosi di calcio''
_ literally, typhus-infected soccer fans.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, soccer is as much a part of life as the church,
family, and food. McGinniss discovers this in an intimate way and
relates even the innermost details, at his own peril. McGinniss
perceived this as a romantic story, the embodiment of some of the
true meritocratic values of sport. The team from a village of 5,000
rises through the lower divisions, defeating clubs from much larger
and more influential cities, and is one step away from competing in
Serie A, the richest soccer league in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of arriving in Castel di Sangro, McGinniss has been
granted access to the most important figures in the region. Once he
learns the language, he develops confidences with nearly everyone
else. He finds that soccer very quickly leads to the Italian heart.
And McGinniss thrives on the opportunity, offering the coach his
opinions on player personnel and tactics. McGinniss's judgments are
remarkably sound, for someone who has been following the game for
only a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   McGinniss immerses himself in the culture. He stands on his seat
at the stadium, urging the coach to make substitutions. He joins
the villagers in cheering on the team. He becomes a part of the
story. ``Finally, at the age of 53, I had been united with my
people,'' he notes after an early-season victory.
</P>
<P>
   As with most sports stories, this one begins with fairy-tale
innocence. Players confide in McGinniss and he even acts in an
agent's role, trying to interest the New England Revolution in
signing a goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   McGinniss was attracted to European soccer by his exposure to
the World Cup, which was held in the United States for the first
time in 1994. The Italian midfielder Roberto Baggio caught
McGinniss's attention, not just because of his Buddhist faith,
ponytail, and charismatic image but also because of his uncanny
ability to decide games in dramatic fashion. McGinniss was so
impressed he changed his e-mail address to incorporate Baggio's
name.
</P>
<P>
   But Baggio is near the top of the soccer pyramid, in all its
glamour, glory, and billions of lira. Only a super ``tifoso'' would
be attracted to the story of Castel di Sangro.
</P>
<P>
   But the story of Castel di Sangro is not all fun and games.
Soccer is also a modern manifestation of ancient city-state
rivalries, even among the small clubs. In Machiavelli's time,
battles were conducted by mercenaries who often merely arranged a
show of force, then negotiated a suitable outcome. Such pragmatism
often prevented messy wars of attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Castel di Sangro achieves its improbable goal of surviving for
another year among the richer clubs, despite problems with
corruption, drug smuggling, a tragic auto accident, absurd
publicity stunts, perceived racism.
</P>
<P>
   McGinniss is about to celebrate a happy ending when reality
intrudes and the season ends on a Machiavellian note. McGinniss
becomes persona non grata in Castel di Sangro. Even during times of
supposed enlightenment, the church and the city-states often exiled
or persecuted artists, scientists, and writers whose work upset the
power structure. And this becomes McGinniss's final Italian lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miracle of Castel di Sangro'' is excellent in its
portrayal of lower-division professional soccer and in providing an
image of a mountainous, remote part of Italy. These two aims of the
book are not as distinct as they might seem to an American reader:
The Uruguayan author Eduardo Galeano notes that with the blending
of cultures, the globalizing of economy and politics, the only true
identifying characteristic of nationality is the style of a
people's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer has provided inspiration for Albert Camus, Roddy Doyle,
Vladimir Nabokov, Harold Pinter, Salman Rushdie, Luis Sepulveda,
Mario Soldati, and many other prominent literati. McGinniss is
among the first of his sociocultural background to write
extensively on the subject. Often, as he admits, he might have been
well advised to opt for silence rather than inserting himself so
boldly into the story he has to tell. But then again, his
ingenuousness and his obtuse nature create the humorous clash of
cultures that makes this story his own.

FIGHTING THE RETURN OF FOUL AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Everybody who likes to take a breath without
choking should be relieved that Carol Browner knows how to fight as
well as make sound policy.
</P>
<P>
   This week the head of the Environmental Protection Agency will
fight a federal appeals court panel's ruling that would gut tougher
clean air standards based on the latest generally accepted
scientific evidence of the dangers ozone (smog) and fine,
particulate matter (soot) pose to healthy lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite two years ago, the EPA received several petitions from
Eastern states seeking relief from ozone pollution originating
elsewhere. This month, the agency acted to make sure that this
relief is granted without the kind of legal train wreck that has
for the moment stopped a more comprehensive approach to harmful
levels of smog and soot.
</P>
<P>
   Browner was able to do this by using an older standard for
permissible levels of smog, providing a legally unassailable basis
for action. That meant that she could approve petitions from New
York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, while
continuing to review the status of Maryland, New Jersey, and
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Fine and dandy. But that still leaves the pending litigation. At
stake is the integrity of the Clean Air Act itself and nearly 30
years of judicially untouched decision-making under five presidents
and 15 Congresses that has updated and strengthened the law three
times.
</P>
<P>
   Also at stake is a logical concept of governance that has stood
the tests of time and litigation for nearly three generations,
since the beginning of the New Deal _ that Congress can delegate
specific rule-making authority to federal agencies under broad
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the second generation of robber barons was seeking to
evade basic responsibilities to American workers and consumers has
serious attention been paid to the lame argument that regulatory
authority is illegitimate unless exercised solely by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But give or take a nuance or two, that is exactly what a divided
appeals court panel here ruled this spring, blithely overturning
more than 60 years of precedent and practice as well as the EPA's
comprehensive reponsive to smog and soot. Presumably the
government's appeal will now go to the full court in the
expectation that a dangerous attempt at radical activism will be
stopped cold.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate impact of the panel's action is on a central
portion of the Clean Air Act _ that the EPA just set air pollution
rules that protect public health, with a decent margin of safety,
based on the best scientific information available. Already, since
1970, the Act has reduced air pollution overall by nearly a third
even as population and economic growth have increased. And it has
virtually wiped out emissions of lead and cut soot by 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the job under the law was far from complete. Early in the
Clinton administration, a massive review of the science by an EPA
panel found smog and soot still at unhealthy levels for 125 million
people, one million of whom face respiratory trouble as a result,
and 15,000 of whom will die prematurely every year.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Browner battled successfully two years ago to toughen
the standards under the law. Her case was so powerful that there
was no serious move to soften, much less set aside, the standards.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, people who produce smog and soot for a living and their
most extreme allies in Congress went for the judicial back door.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the appeals court panel refused to accept the
major claims that there was anything flawed in the EPA's process or
that the science was inadequate or that the tie to adverse health
consequences wasn't shown. It said exactly the opposite. Instead,
it reached back to the dark ages to decide that Congress has
delegated powers only it can exercise _ a recipe in a complex
society for chaos.
</P>
<P>
   As Browner has noted, the stakes go beyond air pollution, to
standards affecting everything from water to food to lethal toxic
waste.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, she was right to press for an all-out assault on the
panel's ruling, and right to do what she could in the interim. And
at least 125 million pairs of fingers are crossed that this attempt
at upsetting one of the pillars of 20th century government is
crushed decisively.

HATCH SEEKS TO ASSUME ROLE OF `CONSERVATIVE ALTERNATIVE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Orrin G. Hatch squeezed into the ``Senators
Only'' elevator as three colleagues waited for the Utah Republican,
who announced last week he is running for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President!'' the senators said gravely, before breaking
into convivial laughter and backslapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need is 25,000 people in New Hampshire,'' advised
Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat who failed to make such
headway in his 1992 presidential bid. Depending on how many
candidates are in the race, that could be the magic number for
victory in the early states of Iowa or New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch eagerly soaked up the sudden attention from his surprise
announcement. ``Twenty-five thousand in New Hampshire, that's
all,'' Hatch mused aloud half-seriously, as he allowed a reporter
to follow him for a morning one day last week, from a limousine
ride to the Capitol, to some quiet moments in his Senate office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people tell me I'm nuts. Why would I do this?'' the
65-year-old Hatch said, acknowledging he is far behind others who
have money, organization, and activists lined up. But he has a
ready answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush is up here,'' Hatch said, holding his hand at
the top of his 6-foot-2-inch frame. ``Elizabeth Dole is number two,
way down here,'' he said, putting his hand at knee level. ``There
is a tremendous void. If something happens to Bush, there's a long
drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one rationale for Hatch's candidacy can be found in the
distance between Bush and the rest of the Republican field of
candidates. While Bush proclaims himself as the ``compassionate
conservative,'' the race is on to be the ``conservative
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, prospects such as former Vice President Dan Quayle and
commentator Patrick J. Buchanan have not caught fire in the polls.
Thus, the theory goes, there is room for a nationally recognized
conservative who could use his Senate-based fund-raising prowess to
break into the pack.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with this theory is many of the most committed
conservatives distrust Hatch. While Hatch said ``no one can doubt
I'm a conservative,'' plenty of people on the right are doubtful
due to Hatch's frequent alliance with his ideological opposite,
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really hard-edged conservatives who might have already
rejected Bush probably wouldn't like Orrin either,'' said David
Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union. ``They think he
plays the game up there too much with Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, for example, worked with Kennedy on a bill that resulted
in providing health insurance for 7 million children. Hatch's ``odd
couple'' alliance prompted the conservative National Review
magazine in 1997 to call Hatch, who is Mormon, a ``Latter-Day
Liberal,'' a cutting reference to Hatch's membership in the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who refers to such criticism as a ``smear job,'' said he
has a 23-year record in the Senate as a conservative. Those
credentials were on display when he backed the nomination of
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court in 1991. Some observers said
Hatch still bears the scars of the Thomas hearings, when he
aggressively questioned Anita Hill's assertion that she was
sexually harassed by Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, however, said his performance in the hearings was
``misconstrued.'' He said many people have changed their minds
about Thomas, because he is a ``terrific justice . . . writing some
of the best opinions, and he is willing to stand up and
courageously take people on.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Hatch's prime reasons for running is that the next
president could nominate three Supreme Court justices and a large
number of federal judges. While Hatch said he does not believe in
litmus tests for judges on issues such as abortion, he has made it
clear he prefers conservatives for the bench. He said his other top
issues would be overhauling Social Security, building up defense,
and cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet throughout much of the morning, Hatch spelled out his
moderate credentials. ``I'm the only senator who can bring Senator
Kennedy to the middle,'' he said. ``And I guess he has brought me
to the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch reeled off examples, such as child care and AIDS
legislation, while emphasizing that he disagrees with Kennedy on
many other issues, such as education. Asked about Bush's
characterization of himself as a ``compassionate conservative,''
Hatch said, ``I called myself that in 1982.''
</P>
<P>
   This prompts Hatch to talk about a side of himself that is
little known to the public. While viewed as the ultimate Utah
Republican, he was born and raised in Pittsburgh, where he also
attended law school as a self-described liberal Democrat. After he
moved to Utah, where he raised six children with his wife, Elaine,
he became a conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a janitor,'' Hatch said, referring to a job during his
college days. ``I was a metal lather. I know what it is like to get
my hands dirty. I'm one of the few senators to hold a union card. I
won't take any crap. I'm a tough guy,'' he said, quickly adding,
``in an open-hearted way.''
</P>
<P>
   After speaking to the board of directors of a drug company
meeting at the Smithsonian Institution Castle, Hatch rode in a
black limousine to Capitol Hill. Striding quickly down a hallway,
Hatch opened an unmarked door and beckoned, ``Come on in. I want
you to listen to something. Did you know I was a songwriter?''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's office is as cozy as a living room. A parade of Beanie
Babies lines the couch. Basketballs from the NBA's Utah Jazz and
WNBA's Starzz rest atop a bookshelf. On his desk is a dog-eared
copy of ``What It Takes,'' the Richard Ben Cramer book about the
1988 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Motioning for silence, Hatch inserts a CD into his office
stereo. The room fills with the sounds of a song he wrote about
children who have AIDS, with the refrain, ``These are the
innocent.'' Hatch is clearly moved by his own words, and he
translates that into a rationale for his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I have `what it takes,' '' Hatch said, launching into an
exhortation about the need to help people who can't help
themselves. What irks him, Hatch said, is when the government helps
``people who don't want to help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's presidential ambitions have prompted more than a few
guffaws in Washington. When Hatch said this week that he is 99.5
percent certain that he is running for president, political analyst
Stuart Rothenberg promptly offered this acid assessment: ``Then I'm
99.5 percent he won't be the Republican nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he really wanted to run for president, he should have done
this a year ago,'' Rothenberg said. ``He should have $6 million in
the bank and political operatives in Iowa, a major presence in New
Hampshire, and he should have visited all these other states early.
I don't see this as a credible candidacy so far. He's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's first test will be financial. Most analysts believe a
credible candidate must raise $20 million or more this year to be
viable early next year. Many GOP candidates have had trouble
raising money in recent months because Bush has lined up so many
top Republican contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, however, has two advantages. First, he can transfer money
from his $1 million Senate campaign war chest to a presidential
bid, although Hatch said he will transfer only a small portion.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Hatch's status as one of the Senate's most powerful
members, including the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee and
a seat on the Finance Committee, could make it easier for him to
bring in presidential campaign contributions than for candidates
who do not hold office.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch also could benefit from support by the 5 million members
of the Mormon Church, according to the senator's confidant, Lee
Roderick.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not be orchestrated by the church,'' said Roderick,
who wrote a Hatch biography called ``Leading the Charge.'' ``But
the reality is once the members know Orrin Hatch is in, there will
be a lot of people who will rise up in grass roots around the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, meanwhile, is listening to advice from fellow senators,
including his ``great friend'' Kennedy, who failed in his 1980
campaign to be president. Kennedy wished Hatch well in the GOP
primaries but plans to support the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennedy said he is going to teach me what not to do,'' Hatch
said. Then again, Hatch recalled, when Kennedy found out Hatch was
once a janitor, the senator told him: ``You should have stuck with
it.''

BODY CLOCK MORE ACCURATE THAN A TIMEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 40 years, circadian rhythm researchers have thought that
humans' biological clocks naturally drift toward a 25-hour day and
have to be set back an hour each day by exposure to morning light
and other time cues.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Boston scientists have overturned this dogma with a set
of experiments showing that the timekeeper buried in the depths of
human brains ticks on a cycle of 24.2 hours. And _ another surprise
_ it keeps excellent time into old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remarkable discovery: an important human function
that does not deteriorate with age,'' commented University of
Pittsburgh neuroscientist Richard Y. Moore. ``Clearly, nature would
not go to the trouble of constructing such an elegant, functional,
and durable timepiece if it was not critical to us throughout our
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The iconoclastic finding, reported in this week's issue of the
journal Science, is causing researchers to rethink many circadian
phenomena. For instance, the reason why elders have a tendency to
awaken too early is not because their circadian timekeepers are
losing track of time, as they long thought. The real reason is
still a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the reason why it's so hard to get up on Monday
mornings is not, as previously supposed, that sleeping in on
weekends promotes to the body clock's natural tendency to slide
toward a longer day.
</P>
<P>
   And specialists will have to reconsider the treatment of a
common sleep disorder called sleep-onset insomnia, because current
therapy is based on the notion of a natural 25-hour cycle. ``This
means a lot of conclusions about sleep disorders are wrong,'' said
Dr. William Dement of Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also resolves a biological paradox: why are humans
unique among living things in having a circadian cycle so different
from the 24-hour day? Now scientists know that we aren't. With very
little variation from one human to another, it now appears that
Homo sapiens has evolved to have an average cycle of 24 hours and
11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is right in line with the Gila monster, mosquito,
kangaroo rat, fruit fly, and all our other brethren in the animal
kingdom,'' said Dr. Charles A. Czeisler of Brigham and Women's
Hospital, who led the new experiments.
</P>
<P>
   How could scientists have been so wrong for so long?
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on Thomas Edison, whose invention of the electric light
bulb 120 years ago changed night into day and altered human biology
in ways researchers are only beginning to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   In scores of experiments over the past four decades, researchers
have studied innate biological rhythms by isolating human subjects
in windowless laboratories without clocks, radios, or other
external time cues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to elaborate lengths to shield people from outside
cues, including even subtle electromagnetic forces, but then we
would give them an electric light and said they could switch it on
and off at will,'' Cseisler said. ``We used to think that people
were relatively insensitive to light and that social interaction
was the potent signal.''
</P>
<P>
   But experiments over the last decade have shown that light ``is
the most powerful signal in this system,'' Czeisler said. In 1996,
the Boston team reported that even ordinary room light can reset
humans' internal pacemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Even totally blind people, the researchers have found, are
exquisitely sensitive to the pacemaker-resetting effects of light
that falls on the retina at the back of the eye, where receptors
transmit the signal to a tiny bundle of cells called the
suprachiasmatic nucleus, lying atop the optic nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Czeisler and his colleagues unmasked humans' real circadian
cycles by keeping 24 subjects (divided into a younger group and an
older group) in isolation for up to 38 days. The researchers
required the subjects to sleep and wake on a 28-hour day _ too far
outside the normal range to allow their body clocks to adapt.
Lights were kept to very dim levels to avoid the clock-resetting
effects that had confounded earlier experiments.

<P>
   The realization that ordinary room light has such powerful
effects in resetting biological clocks has profound implications.
It begins to explain why most denizens of industrialized societies
live with the burden of chronic sleep deprivation _ what Dement has
called ``our national sleep debt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This light we're all getting between sunset and bedtime has
shifted billions of people in the industrialized world several
hours later,'' Czeisler said. ``It's as if everybody in Boston were
shifted to West Coast time, even though we're still living on the
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, many people alter their sleep patterns in an
attempt to repay this sleep deficit. ``You could say that what
happens on the weekends is we stop fighting,'' Czeisler said. ``But
we're the ones, with our own self-exposure to artificial light, who
are inadvertently shifting our clocks to a later hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Research suggests the sleep debt blunts humans' cognitive
performance on a chronic basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know also that when sleep-wake cycle is working at adverse
times with our circadian rhythm we're not going to get good sleep
and our cognitive functioning is not optimal,'' said Andrew Monjan,
of the National Institute on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   What to do about it? It's not likely that 21st-century humans
will go to bed with the sun or spend their evenings in candlelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I think we have to raise the consciousness of people
about the effects of evening light,'' said Richard Kronauer of
Harvard University. ``People need to appreciate the importance of
maintaining a regular sleep-wake schedule or they're going to get
screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also suggest sleeping with room-darkening shades
to avoid light exposure too early in the morning.

<P>
   When Dr. Eugenia Marcus does a routine physical exam, the
pediatrician not only checks the young patient's eyes, ears, and
heart, but asks about guns in the house and quizzes the child about
what to do if he or she found one.
</P>
<P>
   It's a striking example of how the pediatrician's job has
changed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In times past, pediatricians had to deal with so much
infectious disease that there was no time to bring up the fact
that, by the way, Johnny is failing in school and violent toward
his brother,'' says Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she says, with many childhood diseases waning, today's
pediatricians are increasingly confronting problems far outside
their traditional scope, from learning disabilities to child abuse
to the impact of divorce on a family.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly one of the biggest questions following the
Littleton, Colo., school massacre has been: how do you identify
potentially violent young people in time to intervene?
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to look at the Littleton tragedy to see the
questions people are asking _ what is the role of parents? How do
we know which children are going to have that kind of explosive
behavior? What contributes to it?'' says Dr. Barry Zuckerman,
chairman of pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pediatricians are being asked to shoulder the burden of all
the ills of society,'' says Dr. Steven Parker, head of
developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center.
``We're being asked to deal with every problem there is, but we
have less time to spend with patients, not more'' because of
managed care constraints, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This drastic shift has been highlighted with the establishment
of a new specialty called Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics.
In March, the American Board of Medical Specialties added the new
discipline to its 24 existing ones, and will oversee the testing
and certification of the new specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this could make a big difference in pediatrics,'' says
Dr. Ellen Perrin, a pediatrician at the University of Massachusetts
Medical Center and president of the American Society for
Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, the organization that led
the push for the specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do more education of physicians in training,''
she says, and ``we wanted to have greater impact on medical
students and residents and doctors in family practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who become board-certified in the new specialty will
undergo more intensive and standardized training than general
pediatricians normally receive. Many will become teachers
themselves in medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   And their reimbursement by insurers should be better, too. At
present, says Perrin, general pediatricians might spend an hour
with a family talking about behavioral problems ``but (were) only
reimbursed for 15 minutes of `well-child' care,'' she adds. With
their new designation as specialists, the new behavioral
pediatricians presumably will be able to collect larger
reimbursements for their expertise and time.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several decades, research has revealed far more than
was previously known about what is ``normal'' development, how it
varies among individuals, and how it is affected both by the
child's inherent nature and his or her home and community
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Perrin said the new specialist pediatricians will be equipped to
diagnose and treat a long list of disorders in development and
behavior, but also problems that aren't in any textbook. These
might include toileting difficulties, discipline problems, extreme
shyness, and being concerned about being adopted or having gay or
lesbian parents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Developmental disorders include mental retardation, language and
speech delays, autism, and other conditions reflecting a problem in
a child's normal progression through the stages of physical,
mental, emotional, and social growth.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many behavioral disorders are attention deficit and
hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, separation problems,
eating disorders, and oppositional and defiant behavior. Some
problems don't neatly fit into one category or the other, Perrin
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Together, developmental and behavioral disorders affect an
estimated 10 to 20 percent of US children. And, unlike many
traditional diseases, they've not been conquered with a shot or a
pill.
</P>
<P>
   Perrin said the new specialty will benefit families in two ways.
First, because there will be more pediatricians who become
board-certified in behavior and developmental problems, parents
will be able to choose a doctor based on their child's particular
needs. Second, even general pediatricians ``graduating five to 10
years from now should be more sophisticated in these areas _ more
supportive, more knowledgeable about what is a problem, and what
needs early intervention,'' says Perrin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope what this will mean is there will be more (experts)
able to look at'' children's problems, says Dr. Leonard Rappaport,
a behavioral pediatrician at Children's Hospital in Boston. ``There
are now long waiting lists'' for specialists in behavior and
development because there aren't enough people to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment of the new specialty actually reflects a
change occurring over the past several decades, as vaccines and
antibiotics have overcome many common childhood diseases, like
polio, TB, whooping cough, and measles.
</P>
<P>
   Today, says Marcus, families are in need of help to cope with
problems created by higher expectations of children, a faster-paced
society, and, for many couples, less time to attend to their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``With two parents working, everything is so programmed and
scheduled that if something derails it, it can bring down the whole
household system,'' says Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Depression, school problems, drug, and sexual issues _ all are
preoccupying parents who are casting about for help.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, parents had the same concerns in the past, ``but
they didn't see it as what the pediatrician did, and the
pediatricians didn't either,'' says Zuckerman of Boston Medical
Center. Now, he adds, the pediatricians ``see it as part of their
responsibility to address the whole child and the whole family, not
just physical health.''
</P>
<P>
   A milestone in recognizing this change was an article published
in 1973, by Dr. Robert Haggerty, a University of Rochester
pediatrician, who termed behavioral and developmental issues ``the
new morbidities.''
</P>
<P>
   The term reflected what Haggerty and his colleagues had found in
door-to-door surveys in which Rochester families were asked about
their children's greatest health problems. ``It always came out as
behavior, allergies, and teeth,'' he says. ``They didn't mention
the traditional diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   But behavioral problems ``can be disabling'' just as much as
physical diseases, added Haggerty. When such problems are severe,
pediatricians may refer the family to a child psychologist or
psychiatrist. But today there are only 3,500 to 4,000 child
psychiatrists in the United States, while there are 55,000
pediatricians: clearly the pediatricians are the front line in
detecting troubled children and treating them or referring them to
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The new specialist pediatricians _ including some who have been
concentrating in development and behavior without the certification
_ will have to take a test to become board-certified. Training for
the specialty will be done in a three-year fellowship following
residency training in pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Families will be referred to the new specialists by their
general pediatricians in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty says that parents may feel more comfortable being
referred to a behaviorally oriented pediatrician: ``It doesn't have
the stigma of being referred to a psychiatrist,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty adds that he was initially opposed to the new
specialty, because ``I think behavioral pediatrics is a part of all
pediatrics _ I was concerned it would be looked at as something
separate.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he became persuaded of the need for certification so
that insurance companies would reimburse the services
appropriately. He also approves of standardizing the training of
the behavior specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've changed my mind,'' he says. ``I think it's a good
thing.''

ON HEALTH INSURANCE, KENNEDY TRIES TO FIT THE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been seven years since the Clinton administration's
universal health care campaign met an ill fate at the hands of a
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, Democrats have adopted a new strategy and a new
leader _ Senator Edward M. Kennedy _ to bring affordable health
care to all Americans. In the past two years, particularly in
recent months, Kennedy has proven to be an able general.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to push through a huge, complex national
health care plan (such as the Clinton package) that is an easy
target for the GOP, Kennedy and other key Democrats are working to
expand health care one step at a time. Ironically, they are even
getting some support from Republicans along the way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, two years ago Congress, led by Kennedy, expanded
health care to include millions of poor and low-income children
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks ago, the Senate, by a 99-to-0 vote, passed a
bill sponsored by Kennedy that expands health benefits to millions
of workers with disabilities. Called the Work Incentive Improvement
Act of 1999, the bill assures that disabled workers will not lose
their Medicaid and Medicare benefits if they return to work. It's a
strong incentive to get back on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is currently in House committees. Despite some GOP
resistance in the House, supporters say passage by next month is
possible _ perhaps to coincide with the anniversary of the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   With Senate passage of this bill, Kennedy has become the
acknowledged leader for the Democrats on health care issues.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's success in health care is due partly to his skill,
ability, and willingness to work with even some of the staunchest
Republican opponents of his legislation, such as majority leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi and majority whip Don Nickles of
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   A Kennedy backer called the Massachusetts senator ``an
experienced and wily veteran'' who is working to achieve as much
health coverage as he can with a GOP-controlled Congress that
resists expanded care.
</P>
<P>
   Another Kennedy backer said the senator ``never shied away from
his willingness and desire to pass universal health care. More than
41 million Americans are still without health insurance. But in a
Republican-controlled Congress he recognizes the need to do what is
achievable and doable now, and then wait for more opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's leadership role was evident to those at a closed-door
meeting of Senate Democrats last week to discuss their next step
regarding their latest health care goal: passage of their Patients'
Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   During that meeting, some Democrats debated whether to consider
Republicans' version of a managed-care health bill, which contains
little or no improvement, or continue to hold out for a floor
debate on the Kennedy-Dingell Patients' Bill of Rights legislation.
Kennedy made an impassioned case to fight for the Democratic
initiative, and he easily prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP managed-care bill has so little merit that it is not
even supported by such groups as the Chamber of Commerce. Kennedy's
bill, on the other hand, is backed by a host of groups, including
doctors and nurses associations.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans opposing Kennedy hope to persuade the public that
the bill will make health care more expensive, that it will cost
more for family coverage, will increase costs to the federal
government, and will cost the private sector billions more than it
already pays.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP members of Congress know that they cannot back these
arguments up. And they know their arguments will not hold water
with an American public eager for a bill to protect them against
abuses by HMOs and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the GOP dares not allow the Patients' Bill to come to
the Senate floor for a full dicussion on its merits _ despite
repeated requests by Kennedy and other Democrats to do so. If it
were allowed, Democratic arguments would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, for example, offered in a recent speech that ``the
purpose of the Patients' Bill of Rights is to protect American
families against abuses that too often rob citizens of their
savings and their peace of mind _ and even their health and even
their lives. Doctors and patients should be making medical
decisions, not insurance company accountants. Too often today,
managed care is mismanaged care.'' For millions of Americans, he
added, ``these reforms are truly a matter of life or death.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy added that he is confident that if the Republican
majority allows the debate to proceed, ``I believe that the Senate
will pass strong reforms that will be signed into law by the
president.'' This debate, he added, ``is a test of the Senate's
willingness to put a higher priority on the needs of families than
on the profits of special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponents of the Patients' Bill of Rights might
consider that their own political health may be at stake if they
continue to deny protections against health care abuses to millions
of American voters.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MONEY

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a November night in 1985, Stef Fuegi recalls, he saw that a
friend was too tired to continue driving and vainly urged him to
pull over. A nearly fatal accident followed, putting Fuegi in the
hospital for months. Four years later, the accident led to an
out-of-court settlement that made Fuegi a near-millionaire at age
22. But it wasn't to last.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Haven, Conn. resident ended up squandering the
$800,000 he received from the settlement. He bought a Toyota
Superturbo sports car, spent more time at expensive restaurants
than in his own kitchen, and stayed in the best hotels while
following Grateful Dead concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to do with it,'' Fuegi, now 32, says of the
wealth. ``I felt guilty just because there are so many people who
don't have enough. Here I was with the money I didn't earn. There
was no one to talk to. I felt isolated and I felt like if I talked
to people, they wouldn't understand me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuegi's sentiments, though unlikely to evoke sympathy, speak to
the problems some people face when they become wealthy abruptly.
Whether through an insurance settlement, a court verdict, an
inheritance, or the lottery, winning bundles of money and jumping
social classes can pose financial and psychological conundrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``You grew up middle class, you didn't go to Harvard, you went
to UMass, so the questions become: `Do you share? How do you share?
Where do you fit?' '' says Pam Rogers, who works with the Haymarket
People's Fund, a foundation that assists individuals who want to
use their money for social change.
</P>
<P>
   Financial consultants such as Rogers agree that those who get
very rich very fast must cope with a startling fact of life: Big
bucks can create big problems that require considerable thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the suddenly wealthy person, they do tend to go through a
more deliberate process of thinking than a person who has grown up
with money all their life,'' says Amy Domani, a Boston-based family
trustee and coauthor of the book ``The Challenges of Wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, anxiety over money lingers as perhaps our culture's most
private collective taboo. The ambivalence surrounding money can
quickly sap an adult's maturity level.
</P>
<P>
   ``People remain childish around the issue of money,'' says New
Yorker magazine columnist Daphne Merkin, who recently wrote about
her conflicted attitude toward wealth in the publication's
``Money'' issue. ``They either hide it under their beds or buy up a
candy store. Reasonableness must be hard to come by with suddenly
wealthy people.''
</P>
<P>
   Money can be so confounding to so many people that sex, by
comparison, is a more inviting conversation piece. Or, to put it
another way, ``Everyone can have sex, but not everyone can have
money,'' says Dr. Steven Berglas, a psychiatrist whose wealthy
clients sometimes complain that their fortunes prompt a
``competitive rage'' among their friends and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Christopher Mogil and Anne Slepian founded a
nonprofit group, now called More than Money, that tries to help the
wealthy make sense of their good fortune. Among other aids, the
married couple's Arlingon-based organization publishes a newsletter
on managing wealth that now has 1,300 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are excited that they can tap into a whole community,''
says Mogil, who has had personal experience in coping with sudden
wealth. In the '80s, when he received two inheritances worth over a
half-million dollars, he sought advice from others with similar
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't that many people to talk to, yet it was such a
central thing in my life,'' Mogil adds. ``I didn't feel like
talking about it with people struggling for money _ that would be
inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   With More Than Money, readers find a safe corner in which to
vent. The quarterly publication has a different theme each issue.
Recent topics included ``Money and Children,'' ``How Much to
Give?,'' and ``Cross-Class Relationships.'' The publication largely
consists of subscribers' letters contemplating the financial and
moral dilemmas they otherwise couldn't air.
</P>
<P>
   A former Harvard student wrote a letter that was titled,
``Loving My Dad, Not My Inheritance,'' telling how he had arrived
at some particularly hard truths. ``I hadn't been aware that I was
wanting my father's money and waiting for him to die,'' he
recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Though many inheritors certainly live most of their lives
knowing they are going to be wealthy one day, the reality of it can
still have an impact. ``Here I was,'' says Domani, the family
trustee, ``about to tell a woman for the first time she has over a
million dollars. She later told me she was quaking, crying out of
`freakdom.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pond is a financial planner and PBS television
commentator who offers advice to those bequeathed large sums. He
says that inheritors should take the news of their good luck and
use it to take time ``to clarify their values.'' He also suggests
to his moneyed clients that benefactors and recipients have long
discussions prior to an eventual bequest, a practice that enables
adults to impart real-world financial education and values to their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because, if they squander it, they're going to feel awful. You
buy a boat, a second home, and you'' throw the money away, Pond
says. ``You're 56 and you have nothing to show for it. What's this
going to do to your psyche?''
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing the suddenly rich can do, though, Pond
and other consultants say, is to stick with your job, even though
it's tempting to quit. ``Your friends are going to have a lot more
respect for you if you continue to work. They'll admire your values
and feel that even though you're not in their financial ballpark,
you're still one of them,'' says Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Domani echoes that it is important to lead a normal life: ``Take
out a mortgage, go through the bothers of walking the dog, and have
people count on you,'' she suggests.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's the path taken by Bo Peabody of Williamstown, Mass. A few
years ago, Peabody was building up his computer company, Tripod,
and living with four college buddies from Williams while paying
$300 a month in rent. Then, the Internet search engine Lycos bought
Tripod.
</P>
<P>
   For $58 million. He was 26.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Peabody about affluence and here's what he says: ``It tends
to create more hassles than it creates pleasures.'' To counter some
of that, the millionaire bachelor lives in a two-bedroom house,
drives a used Audi, and is paying for his ``little brother'' to
attend a Vermont boarding school as part of the Big Brothers/Big
Sisters program.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody says he has found the true value and best meaning of
money: ``To me, wealth is freedom. It isn't about buying things,
but time and doing whatever you want to do.''

HOW DOES THE BRAIN INTERPRET MUSICAL SOUNDS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How does our brain turn the sounds we hear into what we
perceive as music?
</P>
<P>
   M.R., Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. ``That's one of the very fundamental questions in all of
cognitive neuroscience,'' says Robert Zatorre, Associate Professor
of Psychology at the Montreal Neurological Institute and one of the
world's leading experts on the perception of music. ``...The short
answer is, we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zatorre and other cognitive neuroscientists have been able
to figure out where music perception apparently takes place within
our brains.
</P>
<P>
   Zatorre says a growing body of evidence indicates that the a
section of the temporal lobe of the brain, on your right temple
just above and in front of your ear, is a key site of music
processing.
</P>
<P>
   One clue came from the case of Russian composer Dmitri
Shebalian, who suffered a stroke. He was paralyzed on his right
side, indicating the left side of his motor cortex was damaged. He
was also rendered mute. But he later would write some of his most
impressive music, still able to communicate in the language of
music.
</P>
<P>
   That told neuroscientists that there was probably a separate
area of the brain specific to the processing of music. The question
was, where?
</P>
<P>
   Since Shebalian couldn't speak, it indicated probable damage in
a section of the brain called Broca's area, in the left temporal
lobe, known to be critical to the ability to speak. That was a clue
that the music center might be on the right. So Zatorre interviewed
people known to have brain damage to their right temporal lobe, and
found that indeed, they had trouble processing sound into music.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out not just where but how this musical processing
takes place, may offer important clues about all forms of human
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is a use of sound that's uniquely human,'' Zatorre says.
``Other animals make sounds that sound like music. Like birds
singing. They're just conveying territoriality, or trying to mate.
We're the only species we know of that makes sounds just because we
find them pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding how those uniquely human pathways work would not
shed light on how the human cortex turns any outside stimulus _
sounds, smells, light _ into what we perceive it to be.

WE USED TO KEEP RELIGION OUT OF POLITICS. NO MORE. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it really time to restore faith in American politics?
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush thinks so. Brimming with stories of
Bible study and personal redemption, the Republican presidential
front-runner says it's time to join church and state in a holy
charitable union.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore agrees. Telling tales of the transforming
power of faith, the Democratic front-runner says it's time for
Democrats catch up with the country by putting religion that guides
everyday life into government practice.
</P>
<P>
   Add Elizabeth Dole, Lamar Alexander, Pat Buchanan, and Gary
Bauer all talking about the power and the glory religion has
brought to their lives or stressing Christian values, and Campaign
2000 has all the makings of a national revival meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The last time religion so consumed political life was 1960, when
the public wanted assurances that John F. Kennedy would keep his
faith out of his government if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   And to think that just a few months back, Christian
conservatives Cal Thomas, Ed Dobson, and Paul Weyrich not only
declared that religion had failed its in quest to change
politically, but said it was time to give up the struggle. Talk
about premature surrender.
</P>
<P>
   These days, in a campaign that looks like a battle for the Bible
Belt, both Bush and Gore are calling for greater reliance on
faith-based organizations to deliver basic government services.
Those groups should be eligible for tax dollars to run drug
treatment, homelessness, and youth-violence prevention programs,
for example, the two front-runners say.
</P>
<P>
   That approach _ which expands on a 1996 experiment with welfare
reform that allows religious organizations to run job-training,
counseling, nutrition, and basic medical programs _ marks a key
change from the past, when religious groups that wanted to get
government dollars for charitable work had to set up a secular arm,
such as Catholic Charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who better to help those who need help than people of faith
who are following a religious imperative to love their neighbors?''
asks Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you elect me president, the voices of faith-based
organizations will be integral to the policies set forth in my
administration,'' promises Gore. ``The moment has come for
Washington to catch up with the rest of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Bush campaign, the charge is that what Gore really
wants is to catch up with George W. ``Bush has been doing this
almost since he became governor in 1995,'' sniffs David Beckwith,
Bush's communications manager. ``Gore apparently had an
election-eve conversion on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what has happened to Gore on the road to Des Moines,
the public also seems accepting of the new approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our polling suggests people are much more comfortable mixing
religion and politics than they were in the '60s, when the the
separation of church and state was more in keeping with public
opinion than it is today,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew
Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Saperstein, director and counsel for the Religious
Action Center of Reform Judaism, a church-state watchdog group,
sees three trends that have come together to make politicians more
willing to embrace religion.
</P>
<P>
   The first is federal budget politics: The programmatic squeeze
created by the move from federal entitlement programs to block
grants has created a need to rely on private charities for social
service previously provided by government, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Second, religious groups, rebuffed on more controversial areas
such as prayer in school, have focused their efforts on winning
government support for their charitable work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have an agenda of trying to chip away at the wall,'' said
Saperstein. ``This feels like a vulnerable areas where they might
succeed, and they are all pushing at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's a recognition that faith-based approach does
indeed work for some people.
</P>
<P>
   So why is it a problem to let those same groups tap tax dollars?
Start with the devil that lurks in the details.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's assurances that he would prohibit ``direct
proselytizing,'' it would be nigh unto impossible for a religious
group to stop delivering a religious message just because it had
accepted federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't separate the secular from the sacred,'' says Melissa
Rogers, associate general counsel of the Baptist Joint Committee on
Public Affairs. ``It is like vanilla flavoring in a cake. It all
flows through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when it comes to sectarian charity, faith is often the
central point. As US Representative Barney Frank says, religious
groups cite the religious message they impart as the very reason
for their success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Churches are now saying, `It is precisely because we inculcate
religion and make them better people that you should give us
(taxpayer) money,''' notes Frank. ``My answer to that is, `You have
a right to do that, but you don't have a right to have the
government pay you to do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman sees several problems. Not the least of them is
this: In a universe of religions that run the gamut from moderate
mainstream to fundamentalist to groups most people consider cults,
who would get government dollars?
</P>
<P>
   ``Would Louis Farrakhan get money?'' Frank asks, referring to
the Nation of Islam leader. Or the Scientologists? Or, perhaps, the
group of wiccan practicing witchcraft at Texas's Fort Hood Army
base that has got US Representative Robert Barr, a Republican of
Georgia, so exercised?
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Conn, spokesman for Americans United for Separation of
Church and State, puts it even more starkly. Because the 1996
charitable choice language prohibits discrimination based on
religious character, ``If David Koresh's Branch Davidians were
still around, they could apply for money through this program. That
sounds extreme, but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, if government starts choosing one religion over
another, then it is establishing favored faiths.
</P>
<P>
   It would be vexing indeed to be forced to fund the activities of
a faith one doesn't share; that, after all, was Thomas Jefferson's
very definition of religious tyranny. But it would be more galling
still to see one's tax dollars go to a rival faith when one's place
of worship had been denied funding.
</P>
<P>
   But that's an inevitable result, says Rabbi Saperstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Churches and synagogues and mosques will begin to compete for
limited funding available, and government will have to choose which
groups it thinks can do a better job,'' he predicts. ``This will
have an enormous divisive impact on the religious communities of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the historical lessons that led the founding
fathers to separate church and state in the first place. ``The
first divine,'' that grand old anti-cleric Voltaire acidly
observed, ``was the first rogue who met the first fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly from Depression-era demagogue Father Coughlin to
fallen televangelists Jimmy Swaggart, Jim Bakker, and Marvin Gorman
to cult leader Bhagwan Rajneeshpuram, modern America has never
suffered from a shortage of rogues, rascals, and God frauds. Nor is
there any shortage of religious ideas that seem antediluvian for a
nation whose religious diversity makes official tolerance a
prerequisite for social order.
</P>
<P>
   A sampler: In just the last year or so, the the Southern Baptist
Convention has declared that wives should ``submit graciously'' to
their husbands' leadership; the Anglican bishops have declared that
homosexual practice is incompatible with scripture; conservative
clergy from across different religions have called on America to
take decisive action to oppose homosexuality; and Jerry Falwell has
declared that the Antichrist is stalking the land in the guise of a
Jewish male.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the poor pagan, atheist, or agnostic who would not
only prefer religion-free government, but a public discourse free
of smarmy professions of personal piety?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there seems to be no respite. Unless, of course, one takes
his cue from Huck Finn, who, when churchy civilization pressed too
close for comfort, decided to light out for the Indian territory.
There, at least, one can play a quiet game of blackjack with only
the whimsical gods of chance peering over his shoulder.

LAWYERS AWAIT $8.3B IN TOBACCO CASE FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The zebra stripes that undulate on the avant-garde
walls at Brown Rudnick Freed &AMP; Gesmer greet visitors to a law firm
that trumpets strategic innovation, social conscience, and an
animal intensity for victory.
</P>
<P>
   They also decorate a firm that has a deal with the state to
recover the lion's share of the $2.075 billion in potential legal
fees from the state's share of the national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And like the lion, which often feasts on the zebra, such fees
are deemed predatory by some.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci has called the fee
``obscene,'' Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly has pledged to fight
such an award, and ordinary citizens are left shaking their heads
at the prospect of such mind-boggling riches.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, along with a handful of others, has a similar deal
with the city of Boston for 25 percent of any settlement or award
in the city's suit against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Within the high-rise offices at One Financial Center, where
Brown Rudnick lawyers await arbitration on their fees in the
tobacco case, the talk is of years of painstaking labor, enormous
corporate risk, and the willingness to do the right thing for
millions of lung cancer victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``This piece of litigation was the most labor-intensive
litigation effort in the history of the commonwealth,'' said Thomas
M. Sobol, lead attorney in the case against what he called ``the
most powerful civil litigant in the history of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown Rudnick took on a Big Tobacco behemoth that had never
settled a lawsuit, never mind lost one.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other major (Boston) firm was willing to take this on,''
Brown Rudnick partner Daniel D. Sullivan said. ``Frankly, the idea
that there would be a large cash settlement never occurred to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts will receive $8.3 billion from the national
tobacco settlement to help cover the cost of treating
smoking-related illnesses. Under their original deal with the
state, five firms would share 25 percent of the settlement, or
$2.075 billion in legal fees, with most of that expected to go to
Brown Rudnick, the lead firm in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the national tobacco settlement last November set up an
arbitration process for paying legal fees, separate from any
previous deals law firms may have cut with states.
</P>
<P>
   Under that process, which could be concluded for Massachusetts
this week, Brown Rudnick and the four other firms are likely to get
substantially less. The other firms, according to legal sources,
have asked for a one-time payment of $400 million; the tobacco
industry is said to have countered with $100 million over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Any fees awarded Massachusetts through arbitration would be paid
by the tobacco industry and would not be deducted from the state's
share of the national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But if Brown Rudnick is unhappy with the award, legal sources
said, it could ask the state to honor its deal for $2.075 billion
in legal fees. And that amount would be deducted from the state's
$8.3 billion tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   To many, the prospect of paying lawyers more than $2 billion out
of the state's settlement symbolizes runaway corporate greed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frightening when states team up with trial lawyers to
effectuate these types of situations and these types of fees,''
said J.V. Schwan, counsel for civil justice reform at the
Washington-based Citizens for a Sound Economy. ``It gives them more
money than they know what to do with'' and encourages ``giving
boatloads of money to politicians who are friendly to their
causes.''
</P>
<P>
   States should pay on an hourly or flat-fee basis, Schwan said.
Otherwise, he added, ``It's dangerous to the voters, it's dangerous
to the legislatures, and it's simply bad policy to hire lawyers on
contingency fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobol and other Brown Rudnick lawyers contributed a total of
$7,225 to then-Attorney General Scott Harshbarger between 1995 and
1998, when the attorney general lost to Cellucci in the governor's
race. It was Harshbarger who decided in 1995 to take on the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Brown Rudnick the other firms are: Schneider Reilly
Zabin &AMP; Costello, and Thornton Early &AMP; Naumes, both of Boston; Ness
Motley Loadholt Richardson &AMP; Poole of Charleston, S.C.; and Lieff
Cabrasser Heimann &AMP; Bernstein of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   When Harshbarger decided to sue the tobacco industry, Brown
Rudnick stepped up. For a 150-lawyer firm that did not have a
full-time health-care lawyer before 1991, the move was audacious.
Moreover, Sullivan said, ``It was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Massachusetts was the fifth state to consider
litigation against the tobacco industry, seeking to recover some of
the billions of dollars spent treating the victims of
smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco suit ``was litigation that I would not have gone
near because of the risk,'' said Boston medical malpractice lawyer
Michael Mone, who testified by videotape for the arbitration panel.
``That was a case on which you could literally bet the future
existence of your firm. There were potentially thousands of hours
of work, and very high costs for expert analysis and statistical
analysis in a case that no one had ever won.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown Rudnick cloaks its motivation in idealism, part of the
bold yet caring image that the 51-year-old firm wants to project.
Specializing in corporate and financial law, its promotional
literature declares: ``Nothing by rote. No pat formulas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobol would not say whether Brown Rudnick will try to gain
additional money from the state if the arbitration award is deemed
unsatisfactory. However, he said, ``We think it is best to pursue
fees to the maximum extent possible from the tobacco industry.''
</P>
<P>
   A fight with the state does not appeal to the firm. ``We have
the best collaborative working relationship with the attorney
general's office ever in the history of the commonwealth,'' Sobol
said.
</P>
<P>
   That could sour if Brown Rudnick _ flush with, say, $200 million
from the arbitration award _ seeks to augment its payday with part
of Massachusetts' share of the national settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Rudnick ``will be under tremendous pressure to accept
what's offered (in arbitration) if it's at all reasonable, because
they practice law in Massachusetts,'' said Richard Daynard, a law
professor and chairman of the Northeastern University School of
Law's Tobacco Products Liability Project. ``As a practical matter,
they would be likely to accept anything they saw as a fair
amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Such acceptance also would protect Brown Rudnick's reputation as
one of the more socially conscious law firms in the city. Its
lawyers are encouraged to do substantial pro bono work, and the
time they spend in charitable labor is counted toward the
2,000-plus hours they are expected to bill each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part of the culture of this firm and how people are
valued at this firm to give back of themselves to the community,''
said Ellen Lutch Trager, director of health care strategies for
Brown Rudnick.

   NEW RELEASES: ``The Thin Red Line'' _ Terrence Malick's
long-awaited film, based on the James Jones novel, is a stunning
achievment of idiosyncrasy and artistry over conventional drama.
Malick rarely puts the camera where you expect it. During a battle
scene he floats the camera through the jungle as if he were bored
with the upfront action. Curiously, it also gives us a clearer idea
of combat than Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray's Anatomy'' _ The title, a take-off on the definitive
anatomy textbook, is an X-Ray of monologist Spalding Gray. Hip,
well-written, stunningly subtle, funny, and challenging. And, no
special effects except Gray's brilliantly constructed use of the
language.

OFFICIAL CITES SHORTFALL IN MENTAL CARE FOR YOUTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Suicidal and violent youngsters are languishing in
hospital emergency rooms for hours and in pediatric beds for days _
and are sometimes simply sent home with panic-stricken parents _
because Massachusetts psychiatric hospitals have no room for them.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprisingly frank letter this month to two fellow
commissioners, state mental health commissioner Marylou Sudders
warned that the demand for acute psychiatric hospital beds for
children and adolescents has reached ``near crisis proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the June 10 letter to acting Department of Social Services
commissioner Jeffrey Locke and Bruce Bullen, commissioner of the
Division of Medical Assistance, which is responsible for acute-care
health coverage for the poor, Sudder said that on that day in
Boston alone there were eight children who needed psychiatric
hospitalization but were being held in medical and surgical wards.
</P>
<P>
   Sudders said her agency had received more than a half-dozen
calls from private hospitals asking permission to place children in
adult psychiatric units _ a violation of state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the state normally sees a drop-off in
hospitalizations in the summer months, that does not appear to be
happening, rather, the tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, is only
increasing the demand for care at all levels,'' wrote Sudders.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of mental-health advocacy groups, who have long
argued for more hospital beds for troubled youths, cheered
Sudders's letter and said they agreed with her dire assessment of
the state's ability to treat seriously troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are basically being watched and kept safe, but they are
not getting the treatment they need,'' said Lisa Lambert of Parents
Professional Advocacy League, a children's mental health advocacy
group. ``We wouldn't ask a child with leukemia to wait or send the
child two states away for treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Willett of Pepperell had to wait last fall when her
14-year-old son, Michael, already diagnosed with
obsessive-compulsive disorder, became more seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   After she found him sobbing and collapsed in his room, saying
voices were telling him he was bad and to kill himself, her son
agreed to go to a psychiatric hospital and even packed a bag in
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   But within an hour, Willett said, his psychiatrist called to
break the news that no beds were available.
</P>
<P>
   Although Michael was heavily medicated, Willett and her husband
stayed up half the night, watching to make sure he didn't hurt
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrifying,'' said Willett, who later learned her son
was schizophrenic. ``It's not the same thing as a toothache. You
can't take medication for the pain and just wait. He could have
been dead that night.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of children in need of acute psychiatric care tends
to undergo seasonal and even daily fluctuations. Friday, for
example, about two dozen out of the 376 acute psychiatric beds for
youngsters were available, according to Division Medical of
Assistance spokesman Richard McGrail.
</P>
<P>
   On many days, the system is overbooked. The logjam has been made
worse with the recent closing of the New England Regional Center in
Stoneham and Charter Brookside in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, demand for mental health services for children
and adolescents has only grown since the student shootings at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., which has made parents,
teachers, and mental health professionals more vigilant about
trying to make sure troubled youngsters get help, say advocates and
mental health professionals.
</P>
<P>
   David Mattioto, head of the Massachusetts Association of
Behavioral Health Systems, which represents psychiatric hospitals,
estimated 20 to 30 youngsters in need of acute care are turned away
each day because an equal number of youngsters are ``stuck'' in
short-term psychiatric hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The ``stuck kids,'' many of whom are in the custody of the state
Department of Social Services, are ready to move into other
programs such as long-term psychiatric hospitals, residential
treatment centers, and foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   But those programs often have long waiting lists. And some
residential treatment programs _ still jittery following the
restraint-related death of 16-year-old Mark Soares in a Marlborough
group home last year _ are refusing to take in youngsters they feel
ill-equipped to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``With managed care, psychiatric hospitals don't do what they
are supposed to do,'' said Locke, whose agency has about 200
residential treatment beds under contract. ``They say, `Forty-eight
hours ago this child came in eating razor blades. We have adjusted
the child's medication and the child says they aren't hungry. Here,
the child is yours.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Locke said many stuck youngsters also tend to have multiple and
complex mental health problems no single program can deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in the number of youngsters with serious mental
health problems is not a recent phenomenon, but has been taking
place over a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   David R. DeMaso, associate chief of psychiatry at Children's
Hospital in Boston, said that in 1992 an average of 35 youngsters,
ranging in age from 2 1/2 to 19, showed up in the emergency room
each month in need of mental health treatment.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the monthly average has been 90.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have been meeting in recent months to try to
address the logjam in the child and adolescent mental health
system.
</P>
<P>
   DSS plans to provide more funding to residential treatment
programs so they can hire more mental health staff workers, Locke
said.
</P>
<P>
   McGrail said 25 acute-care and transitional-care beds have been
added to the psychiatric hospital system since April and there are
plans to add as many as 80 more this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatric hospitals also have been negotiating with state
officials over state payment rates for stuck youngsters. The state
payment rate drops from $700 to $150 a day for children who no
longer need to be in psychiatric hospitals, a policy hospitals say
is placing them in financial jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Not all are convinced the problem will be easily solved.
</P>
<P>
   State officials such as Sudders and Locke say state agencies
must work together to get a clear picture of how many youngsters
are in need of mental health services _ and how many are being
turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder how a mental health system dealing with kids could
be so messed up,'' said Locke. ``I am not confident we have found
all the answers yet. But everyone is working in the right direction
and I think we are all committed to seeing this stop.''

 DRAFT-KETNER-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ What is the correct posture for dealing with
adversity? Shoulders and head high, back straight, feet firmly
planted? Or is it possible to tackle the trials of life with you
head hung low, your shoulders slouched, and your eyes staring at
the floor?
</P>
<P>
   Former University of Massachusetts center and current NBA draft
hopeful Lari Ketner has been wrestling with such questions for
years.
</P>
<P>
   One day 10 years ago, the 12-year-old Ketner came home from
school with his shoulders slumped, a sure sign he was struggling
with a growth spurt that had left him 6 feet tall. His mother,
Aasya Wright, had told him to stand up straight, and he obliged for
a time but soon returned to his hunched stance.
</P>
<P>
   So Wright approached her son from behind and punched him
squarely in the back. That did the trick. But Ketner told his
mother that her blow reminded him of the verbal salvos he took at
school from kids who poked fun at his size. The taunts were enough
to make him hang his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, son,'' she said. ``God just loves you more, so He
took more time with you. Don't pay those children any mind. You're
going to play in the NBA someday.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her son would continue growing, and by the time he left for
UMass, Ketner had attained a stature ideal for future draft
consideration: 6 feet 10 inches, 270 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But his sensitivity increased as well, and it proved one of his
downfalls during a senior season at UMass in which he often
struggled to duplicate a promising junior campaign and was labeled
as one of the biggest disappointments in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   His mother's prediction was in serious jeopardy in March, but
Ketner got an opportunity to salvage it when he was invited to the
Phoenix Desert Classic, a postseason invitational for players
looking to improve their draft status.
</P>
<P>
   But as he was bound for Phoenix, he was hit with another
setback. His mother was scheduled for a second operation to remove
tumors that were discovered over the latter part of Ketner's senior
campaign; she had not told him of her condition for fear of adding
to his worries.
</P>
<P>
   Wright once again encouraged her son to stand up to his
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day he was about to leave for Phoenix, I had to go in to
have more surgery,'' said Wright, who was found to have nine tumors
after five biopsies were conducted in one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I'll be fine, but now you have to go out there
and do what you're supposed to do. You have to go out there and
kill those guys. Go out and use your God-given talent.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So Ketner left his mother's side and went to Phoenix eager to
improve his draft status, in part so he could make enough money to
allow her to retire from work. Many people, including UMass coach
Bruiser Flint and personal trainer and mentor John Hardnett,
encouraged him to take advantage of his make-or-break opportunity
despite the weight of his mother's health on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to put it behind you,'' said Hardnett, ``because
unfortunately, you've been labeled by so many people as a failure
that you can't fail this time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one speaks of the 2-point performance against College of
Charleston anymore. Or the 2 points against Virginia Tech, the 5
against Duquesne. His being benched against Marshall, sidelined
against Boston College for violating team rules? Doesn't come up
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Talk now begins with the 16 points and 10 boards he had on the
first day at the Desert Classic. That was followed by a slew of
calls from agents and scouts, personal interviews with the Chicago
Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Sacramento Kings, then workouts
with the Atlanta Hawks and Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   Ketner made good on his opportunity, and it appears most scouts
have been willing to forget about his dreadful senior campaign. On
draft night, he will discover how much. His co-representative, Vic
Carstarphen, said Ketner has been projected to go between the 18th
and 25th picks. Others say he will go either late in the first
round or early in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't feel he had a very good senior year, and to his
credit, he didn't, either,'' said Bob Zuffelato, director of
basketball operations for the Raptors. ``Then he went to Phoenix
and opened some eyes, and people gave him another hard look with
some workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a good body, is strong, and can post people up, so he
was impressive in that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ketner then went to the predraft camp in Chicago and didn't fare
as well, but neither did he hurt his stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it takes is for one decision-maker to like him, and that's
where he will go in the draft,'' said Cavaliers scout Rick
Weitzman, formerly of the Celtics. ``He went out to Phoenix and
Chicago and played hard, and those were encouraging signs.''
</P>
<P>
   Those encouraging signs have made Ketner more confident and
effervescent. In fact, he now smiles at recounting his arrival in
Phoenix, when he ran into Bulls general manager Jerry Krause, who
said, ``What are you doing here? If you had played the way you did
as a junior, you wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I had to do was to show everybody that I was serious
about playing,'' said Ketner, who was named preseason All-America
by several publications after averaging 15.2 ppg and 7.4 rpg as a
junior.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that success, however, came when Ketner played alongside
widebody Tyrone Weeks on the UMass front line. Last season, he was
the focal point, often double- and triple-teamed. As a result, his
numbers were down to 10.6 ppg and 5.3 rpg. He fouled out five times
and was held under 40 percent shooting 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   Ketner didn't respond well, and before long it became evident
that making good on his mother's claim would depend on his
emotional approach rather than physical attributes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went into Phoenix, I just wanted to be in shape when I
got there, play hard, and do the things everybody thought I was
capable of doing,'' Ketner said. ``And I was able to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the season I got a little frustrated. Things weren't
going my way. The team didn't have, pretty much, the same goals. It
seemed like, maybe to many people, that I didn't want to be out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It all took a toll on the team, which endured its first losing
season in 10 years and failed to reach the postseason for the first
time this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Ketner was supposed to be the next in a line of UMass pivots _
including Lou Roe, Marcus Camby, and Harper Williams _ that kept
the winning ways going. Many figured his upside for the next level
was better than the others' because he was the only one whose
natural position was center.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he and the team failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like everybody had different agendas,'' said Ketner.
``Some people felt playing was more important than winning. Once
the season didn't go the way everybody wanted it to go, a lot of
pressures came down on the seniors, me and Charlton (Clarke).''
</P>
<P>
   Things capsized against Iona, as Ketner fouled out after
tallying just 4 points and 3 rebounds. He went to the bench,
slumped over, and cried while assistant coaches consoled him. Some
say that moment brought as much criticism as any of Ketner's
on-court shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just got tough, with the season, people saying everything
about Coach, saying things about players, things like that,'' said
Ketner. ``I went from one year of being praised to another of being
killed. I really wanted to win. I came in with goals of being
better than the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually it took its toll. I couldn't hold it in anymore. It
came out with tears. I didn't have anyone to talk to, because the
coaches were like, `Well, you have to suck it up and play.' They
don't understand. Coaches are going to be coaches. They're going to
do what they need to do to get you to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   But Flint maintains there were folks to whom Ketner could talk.
Indeed, the day after the Iona game, the team held a three-hour
meeting before heading to New York to play Fordham. Prior to that
game, Camby, who was by then a New York Knick, met with Ketner in
the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, we had plenty of talks _ we had private talks and
public tallks,'' said Flint. ``He's 22 years old, 6-10, 275 pounds.
And he's a kid. That was the toughest thing. I used to tell him
that, throughout life, he was going to have things like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when our academic coordinator left with Cal (former
UMass coach John Calipari), Lari said, `I can't make it here.' I
told him that it was just a setback, and you have to go on. That's
the same thing here.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people don't realize is that you can talk until you're
blue in the face, and until the kid understands, you don't know how
he's going to respond. Lari is very sensitive. He had to go through
things like this because he needed it to make it in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aasya Wright laughs when she thinks back on the time she punched
her son in the back, and on her approach to single parenthood in
general.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it worked; she raised two boys in a section of
Philadelphia where drugs are sold on her street corner, where
Ketner was once mugged in front of his home. She sheltered them,
kept them off the streets and out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   She is well aware that some considered her overprotective of her
towering son and that it contributed to Ketner's sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really close with my family, so when I say I raised
them by myself, I mean it,'' she said. ``The reality is that it's
hard when you try to teach them one thing and the streets are
teaching them another. Lari being so big, he was a target for drug
dealers. I had to do what I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright is all but recovered from the ailments that made for a
fretful year. Equally difficult was keeping it from her son. He
would call home and discover that she had to leave work early or
had blacked out on the train ride home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't even tell me at first. She told Kit,'' said Ketner,
referring to UMass backup center Kitwana Rhymer, Ketner's best
friend. ``Kit knew for a while. He found out during the middle of
the season. I found out from the middle to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``She finally told me, and then I told Kit, and Kit was like,
`I've known for a while.' And I was like, `How come you didn't tell
me?' and he said, `Lari, you know how you worry.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But she's recovered, and she's stopped work. Now, she's just
looking over me, making sure I do what I need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether he gets drafted, Ketner probably will end
up right where his mother said he would. Her aim is that he stays
on the straight and narrow wherever he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told him all he needs to do is put God first,'' said
Wright. ``I let him know that I would die for him, that I want the
best for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also told him, `If you go out there and act like Dennis
Rodman, I'm going to kill you.' He wasn't raised that way, and I'm
not having it.''

   !! 1/2 ``Big Daddy'' Adam Sandler softens the usual gross-out
stuff by putting a kid between himself and it. It's a clever enough
piece of manipulation, though not so clever that you're ever
unaware you're watching strings being blatantly pulled. Sandler is
a good-hearted slacker who finds himself pushed into adulthood by
playing father to his absent roommate's kid. Still, you'll likely
laugh often enough to put up with it. (PG-13) &QL;

   !!1 1/2 ``Eternity and a Day'' Greek filmmaker Theo
Angelopoulos's intimate epic about an aging poet (Bruno Ganz)
getting ready to die turns into a poetic meditation on life and the
things that give it flavor. There are times when the film slows
down, but its aspirations are so high and its rewards are so deep
that they more than repay the response it asks. (Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   !!!! ``An Ideal Husband'' Sheer delight, as filmmaker Oliver
Parker finds ways to update Oscar Wilde with sparkle and nuance,
exchanging farce for comedy and comedy for romance. It's
brilliantly played by a lively and silken ensemble that includes
Cate Blanchett, Jeremy Northam, Julianne Moore, Minnie Driver, and
Rupert Everett, drolly underplaying (in ways he never could in a
stage production) the central role of a dandy unable to conceal his
generous heart beneath Wilde's wit. (PG-13)

TURN OF THE CENTURY 
By Kurt Andersen. Random House. 659 pp. $24.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its mag wheels and major torque, Kurt Andersen's ``Turn of
the Century'' is the killer SUV of the summer: It's big and
unwieldy and way over-powered, but it's also flashy and
symbolically cool _ a semiotic key-card into the land of In. Some
of the atmospheric pressure surrounding the novel is based on
authorial vita. One of the cofounders and editors of Spy magazine
(which managed to be legendarily funny within its first five
minutes on the newsstands), Andersen has high-gloss media
credentials that include New York magazine (former editor), Time
(former architecture and design critic), and The New Yorker
(current columnist). All of which make him eminently qualified to
take on Manhattan as subject, target, and major character of this
gargantuan first novel. And there's no argument that ``Turn of the
Century'' is brimming with wit, intelligence, and double-cappuccino
cleverness. What it doesn't possess is much evidence that Andersen
knows how _ or why _ to write a novel. Or, it must be added, when
to end one.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the creepily familiar cyberworld of the day after
tomorrow, ``Turn of the Century'' opens in February 2000, in a New
York where cell phones ring at funerals and where Prada and the
price of Microsoft matter more than God. It's today taken up a
notch, in other words: a virtually realistic New York from Hell _
exactingly depicted here in computer and stock-market patois,
saturated with pop culture and media references and fueled by its
own near-nihilistic irony. Imagine Jay McInerney's love-hate affair
with New York crossed with Tom Wolfe's unstoppable satire, and
you'll get an idea of this novel's hybrid impulses. But that
description stops short of capturing Andersen's byzantine grasp of
the arcane, artificial world a lot of postmodern powerbrokers
inhabit: that place where everything, including sex and money,
happens on screen. Oh, and cyber-death. Leave it to a couple of
hackers to try to accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   The Ken and Barbie at the center of this high-pixel coldness are
George Mactier and his wife, Lizzie Zimbalist. Besides their three
precocious children (the youngest is death-obsessed), they have
important careers to parent. He's a producer for MBC, the brazen
new TV network run by Harold Mose; she's a software maverick and
Harvard MBA trying to run her own company and stay out of Bill
Gates's way. Or in it, for the price. Much of ``Turn of the
Century'' involves the steaming behemoth that is Microsoft, from
its NASDAQ worth at day's close to the virtual existence, or lack
thereof, of the wealthy misfit who runs it. Married for a decade,
George and Lizzie are a prime-time-of-life couple who started out
pretty normal _ Minnesota boy and LA girl _ each of them now more
successful than they ever dreamed and riding the wave. Which has
its cost: When George's mother is killed in a car accident in the
opening pages of the novel, his overriding concern is the
new-series presentation for Mose he has scheduled that evening.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of virtual grief, delivered deadpan, is supposed to set
the tone of the novel _ meant to signal that real emotion has been
traded for Nielsen-number thrills, and that even the ambient noise
here will be over-the-top. What ensues is in keeping with that
message, with Lizzie and George lurching among LA, Seattle, Tokyo,
and New York, each consumed with the absurd cruelties of fame and
success. George's pet project, hailed and feared by critics before
it's even in production, is a factoid-fiction show called ``Real
Time,'' where actors read the news, and invented ``dramedy'' is
spliced into world-events copy. Torn among the demands of
motherhood in New York and a dying father in LA, Lizzie is having
dinner with guys like Buster Grinspoon, who has been doing brain
implants on cats and thinks artificial intelligence is about to be
smarter than Einstein. Then Harold Mose tries to hire her as his
in-house media genius, and the discrete spheres of Mactier et
Zimbalist have become, whether they like it or not, a conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Their newly blended corporate family takes the story into the
realm of black screwball comedy, with George assuming that Lizzie
is sleeping with Mose and Lizzie assuming George is losing his
mind. Neither fear turns out to be true, but their interminable
quests to find that out make Myst look like a game of computer
solitaire by comparison. The straight line between fact and
revelation _ George and Lizzie talking, in other words _ has been
replaced by the garbled web of the modern age: e-mail and
cyber-stalking and memos left in town cars, or rumor and electronic
pagers and misplaced power books. The ultimate example of this
media manipulation is George's visit to a psychiatrist, a man who
is his and Lizzie's mutual friend. Wanting to convince George of
his wife's fidelity, the shrink reveals that he's been snooping in
his own girlfriend's e-mail, where the only ``hard'' truth about
Lizzie's innocence exists.
</P>
<P>
   There are also countless subplots, the best of them involving a
trio of hackers who break into Reuters, a financial wizard with a
golden heart who can make Wall Street swoon with a click of his
finger, and a limo driver with a strange accent who used to work
for Microsoft. There are weird characters galore: Harold's TV
wizard, Featherstone, who speaks only in cliche and hyperbole;
George's brother-in-law, Cubby, who has spent his life building a
miniature model city that no one will ever see _ a job that seems
more meaningful than any in the novel. And there are about 19 witty
lines and insider jokes per page, which is amusing and impressive
at first, then tiresome, then enervating. About halfway through the
nearly 700 pages of this kind of high-IQ cleverness, you start to
feel as though you're trapped in e-mail jail _ where you get
distribution-list nonsense that goes on forever, but you have to
keep reading to see if anything important is encrypted therein.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen's intelligence is unquestionable. He is funny, shrewd,
and erudite, and he has a facility for the set piece, whether it's
Lizzie's power golf with the guys or George's meeting with a
Hollywood wonder boy. What Andersen doesn't have, or at least
doesn't exhibit here, is the novelist's heart _ the sensibility
that knows the difference between dialogue and depth, and that can
convince us that any of this matters. We learn piecemeal, for
instance, that George has lost part of his arm to a mortar shell in
Nicaragua, when he was a journalist for Newsweek, but this
information is used so poorly _ either as farce or as nonchalant
pathos _ that it winds up seeming irrelevant. The most humanly
revealing parts of the novel are few and far between; when they're
introduced at all, it's often at their own expense, and
consequently more contrived than revealing. Deus ex machina nova.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to love this novel, even if it is too long by half. It
starts off with delightful gusto and street-smart skepticism, and
then it keeps on repeating the same high-wire tricks. In the
paradox that defines so much of art, satire, to work, must have a
perceptible emotional and moral center _ otherwise it strays toward
the empty towers of cynicism and nihilism. Andersen's emotional
center appears far too seldom and too late in ``Turn of the
Century,'' which falls victim to its own satirical devices. And as
the writers of George's fact 'n' fiction show might tell you, if
you don't believe it, you've at least got to care.

ON-LINE BANKING SHOULD BE DONE WITH CAUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd think Bob Kerwin would be clutching his old-fashioned
checkbook after his horrendous first experience paying a bill
through BankBoston's on-line banking system.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he still finds some benefits to using the bank's
HomeLink program. But he has learned the hard way _ through a
four-month ordeal that included mis-sent funds, dozens of
``customer-relations'' phone calls, conflicting explanations and a
temporarily canceled credit card _ that on-line banking has some
risks that are worth avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very selective about what bills I pay using HomeLink,''
said Kerwin, a 37-year-old software salesman.
</P>
<P>
   It was late February when Kerwin made his debut click with the
BankBoston's popular on-line banking system. He picked a relatively
simple transaction: He requested that a $300 check be drawn from
his BankBoston checking account and sent to his BankBoston Visa
account to pay a monthly bill.
</P>
<P>
   He figured it was an easy transaction, which would require only
one easily-cut check mailed directly to BankBoston Visa. Also, the
money essentially was being transferred within the same institution
and the amount was a nice flat sum.
</P>
<P>
   But about two weeks later, on March 13, BankBoston Visa informed
him that they never received his check. Because of nonpayment, the
credit card was temporarily shut off and marked delinquent.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Kerwin called the HomeLink program. It showed they
sent a $300 check to BankBoston Visa and the check cleared on March
3.
</P>
<P>
   What gives?
</P>
<P>
   After four months of an exhaustive, one-man crusade to correct
the problem, Kerwin discovered that his $300 check mistakenly went
to Fleet Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In April, he managed to get a clerk to give him a copy of the
cashed check. The ``payee endorsement'' section of the back of the
cashed check showed a stamp from Fleet Bank in Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Kerwin presented it to BankBoston officials, but it wasn't good
enough to get him off the hook. They declined to credit him $300 in
his checking or credit card accounts.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston Visa and HomeLink officials insisted they couldn't
fix the problem until they got the $300 back from Fleet, and, at
various times, suggested more investigation needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   As if it were some grand gesture of generosity, BankBoston Visa
officials told him in April they would no longer label his account
past-due and they would raise his credit limit from $7,000 to
$7,300.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out my $300 since the beginning of March,'' said
Kerwin, after e-mailing us for help. ``We're now at the end of
June. Why should I be out the money? It's not my mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   When we made some calls last week, BankBoston officials
confirmed the check mistakenly got into the hands of Fleet Bank in
a bizarre glitch that BankBoston officials say has nothing to do
with the proposed merger of the institutions.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston spokesman Bruce Spitzer said he has yet to figure out
the exact problem, but believes it was caused either by a coding
mistake or clerical problems at either the HomeLink or Visa
check-processing centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did go to Fleet, but we don't know how it got there,''
Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the face of the check says BankBoston Visa,
Fleet cashed the check and got the money.
</P>
<P>
   Kerwin said he's a reasonable guy and knows life is full of
innocent mistakes. But he is baffled at how long it has taken
BankBoston to correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the bank is issuing an apology to Kerwin about the
long ordeal and has credited his account $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret the amount of time it has taken to come up with the
answers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the bank has now set up Kerwin's HomeLink account
so that, in the future, Kerwin can transfer funds directly from his
checking account to his Visa account, eliminating any need to cut a
check. If you don't use this transfer system, the only way now to
pay such BankBoston Visa bills on-line is through individually cut
checks.
</P>
<P>
   He insists such problems are extremely rare with the HomeLink
program, which has 350,000 customers and 22 percent of the bank's
retail customers.
</P>
<P>
   For Kerwin, he's pleased to finally get his $300 and now feels
as if this sobering experience has taught him about the possible
drawbacks of the on-line banking world. He said he now uses on-line
banking only for registered vendors, such as some phone companies
or department stores that can receive HomeLink payments directly,
without the need for checks.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also thinks twice before using on-line banking for
big important bills, such as mortgage payments that have strict due
dates. He can't bear the thought of another lost check.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to hold onto his money longer. When HomeLink cuts
a check, your money is deducted almost immediately. It's sent into
limbo land, collecting no interest, until the payee cashes it. With
traditional checks, you hold onto the money until the check clears.
</P>
<P>
   Kerwin said he hopes this one consumer fiasco is his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I got my $300 back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Defective stroller fiasco
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A mother of infant twins sent us a letter complaining that
Boston Baby in Newton, Mass. refused to exchange a defective
double-stroller she bought this year.
</P>
<P>
   As Kathryn Delhome puts it, she bought the Graco
double-stroller, called Duo Rider, last January at this baby
mega-store, along with $5,000 in baby furniture and car seats. She
didn't start using the stroller until the warm weather in April,
and within two months, the strap for one of the seats broke.
</P>
<P>
   When she pursued the problem with the store, the managers told
her to call Graco. When Delhome called Graco, the company said they
could ship her a new seat with a new strap, but she would probably
not get it until August. Furious, she went back to the store and
was again told it couldn't do a thing.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to state law, the store has direct responsibility
for bad goods. Merchants are allowed to set any refund policy they
want for nondefective goods, but they must refund, replace or
repair _ it's the customer's choice _ any defective merchandise
sold at their store, said assistant attorney general Diane
Szafarowicz.
</P>
<P>
   We called owner Harvey Slobodkian on Thursday, inquiring about
this case. He initially defended the store's actions, saying he
hadn't ruled out ``consumer abuse'' in explaining the broken strap.
He also said he found it difficult to talk to the couple because
they were so angry at him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, he said he would provide them with a new harness
at no charge for the stroller, or if necessary, he'd comply with
their request for a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   But Delhome said she's just going to wait for the Graco-shipped
seat because she doesn't want to re-enter Boston Baby. ``I don't
want to deal with the store again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Odds &AMP; ends
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Revenge for telemarketer calls. What do you do when a
telemarketing firm calls you repeatedly after you tell them to
stop? The answer is that you have legal recourse, but it's not
easy, state officials say. First, you must document as much as you
can, including dates and times of the calls and the name of the
company and callers. Tell them you want to be on their do-not-call
list. If you can prove the repeated calls caused you to incur at
least $50,000 in damages (such as getting tricked into a fraudulent
deal), you can sue in federal court under the telemarketing sales
law. If it was an automated-voice call, you can sue in small claims
court. But still the hassle falls in your lap. The best bet is
probably to call your state's attorney general's office with your
data. They have the power to bring action if they get repeated
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   --Phone fee increase. Four weeks ago we told you about a way for
low-volume phone users to avoid some of the fees popping up on
their long-distance bills. We suggested doing away with your
long-distance carrier and using a dial-around company (the 10-10
numbers), a prepaid calling card or an Internet calling system to
make your calls. At the time, the only fee involved with this
approach was a 53-cent-a-month charge to cover the cost of
long-distance access. Now we have learned that as of July 1, that
fee will rise to $1.04 for primary lines, $2.53 for nonprimary
lines. The increase cuts the amount of savings, but it still may
make sense. After all, fees assessed by long-distance companies are
also expected to rise.

ARRIVAL OF V-CHIP LETS PARENTS TUNE OUT UNWANTED TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The V-chip is here.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, televisions equipped with the device
have started appearing on store shelves. But some consumer groups
and parents foresee problems with the device that is being touted
as a tool for filtering unwanted programming from children's
television viewing.
</P>
<P>
   The V-chip will be in at least half of all new television sets
13 inches or larger on the market by Thursday, as required by the
1996 telecommunications act. By January, the device will be a
regular feature.
</P>
<P>
   At least 25 million new television sets are expected to be sold
within the next 18 months, according to Representative Edward J.
Markey, the Malden Democrat who drafted the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few months, tens of thousands of V-chip TVs will be
in homes all across America. Within a year, millions and millions
of Americans will own one,'' said Markey's spokesman, David
Moulton.
</P>
<P>
   Even if new televisions come equipped with a V-chip, millions of
families still own TVs without the device, said Andrew Schwartzman,
president of Media Access Project, a telecommunications law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the V-chip in one TV doesn't prevent kids from watching
a TV in the next room that doesn't have one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Televisions that are not equipped with the device can be
upgraded with the purchase of a V-chip box.
</P>
<P>
   V-chips block out selected programs by reading the ratings based
on viewer age and content that flash on the screen during the first
15 seconds of a program. The technology for the V-chip to read the
electronic ratings works the same way that close-captioned
information is transmitted.
</P>
<P>
   All V-chips require an access code, usually a four-digit number,
to activate or deactivate the device. Based on the television
ratings, parents can choose to block certain programs through the
V-chip by entering the code.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as you wouldn't tell anyone your ATM or calling-card PIN
number, you don't tell your kids the V-chip code,'' said Kathryn
Montgomery, president of Center for Media Education, a children's
advocacy group that has compiled a booklet to help parents
understand the V-chip. The pamphlet is available at
www.vchipeducation.org.
</P>
<P>
   However, several parents looking for television sets at one
store this week said they were not particularly interested.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelhadi El Tahir of New York, shopping with his two children,
ages 10 and 14, said although he agreed with the purpose of the
V-chip, he sees problems with the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blocking channels out will make children even more curious,''
El Tahir said. ``These days, children are more technically able,
and they'll find ways to get around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin James of Washington, who has a 4-year-old, said even if her
television was equipped with a V-chip, she would be reluctant to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you block out certain shows, there's always going to
be something that you missed,'' James said. ``You have to be like
God to catch everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Charren, a visiting scholar at the Harvard School of
Education and founder of Action for Children's Television, said she
believes parents will be more likely to use the V-chip after the
school shootings in Littleton, Colo., and the recent debate in
Congress about youth violence and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But Charren said the V-chip and the television ratings system
have their drawbacks. Because the V-chip, when activated,
automatically filters out programs based solely on the ratings,
certain beneficial shows could get censored, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Programs about the Civil Rights Movement or about war will get
flagged for violence,'' Charren said. ``But those programs are the
kind of things that parents might actually want their children to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Charren said the best way for parents to use the V-chip is to
talk to their children about the kinds of programs they want them
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``V-chip or no V-chip, only parents can take care of their
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   V-chip advocates say the device can be an additional tool to
help parents monitor their children's television viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The V-chip is not supposed to be a baby sitter,'' said Ann
Saybolt of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association,
which represents the TV makers. ``It's not a replacement for
parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take only a few years for these new televisions to
become a staple in American homes. According to the latest Census
Bureau statistics, 98 percent of all households have an average of
2.3 television sets each _ a total of about 223 million TVs. The
Center for Media Education estimates that about 25 percent of all
households purchase a new television every year.
</P>
<P>
   V-chip advocates attribute the initial hesitance of parents to
use V-chips on a lack of awareness. Federal Communications
Commissioner Gloria Tristani said many parents don't realize that
the technology is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we educate parents about the V-chip, they can't use it
to make educated choices for their children,'' Tristani said.
</P>
<P>
   In a random survey of 13 major electronics stores in the
Washington area, only one reported having customers ask about the
V-chip, and that was from a few shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Markey sent letters to top national
newspapers urging them to include both the age- and content-based
ratings in their TV listings.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of USA Today and the Boston Herald, most of
the nation's top-selling newspapers, including The Boston Globe,
carry only the age-based ratings, according to Markey. A Globe
spokesman said the editors are looking into the matter with the
syndicate that provides the daily listings to the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make the ratings as familiar to the parents as
the Nike `swoosh' is to the kids,'' Markey said.

By Helen Langdon. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. 436 pp. Illustrated.
$30. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three full-length biographies, several important interpretive
studies, a couple of crime novels. That's the list of books on the
Italian painter Caravaggio published in just the last year, just in
English. And it doesn't count catalogs for exhibitions that
included stellar shows at the Boston College Museum of Art and the
Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, which owns the only Caravaggio in
New England, ``The Ecstasy of St. Francis.'' (It's on tour until
mid-July, when the Atheneum puts it back on view.) The attendance
at the BC show _ almost 66,000 _ set a record for the museum. Then
there's Derek Jarman's 1986 feature film, ``Caravaggio,'' which got
a jump on the craze.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about Michelangelo Merisi, born in 1571 in the small
Lombard town of Caravaggio, that fascinates so? British author and
art historian Helen Langdon attempts to figure it out in
``Caravaggio: A Life,'' the latest of the biographies. On the
surface, the reasons for the painter's allure are obvious. He was
the original bad-boy artist. He divided his time between street
gangs and sybaritic cardinals. He was an habitue of Italian jails.
He was also, people have assumed all along, a homosexual; hence the
bee-stung lips and come-hither eyes of those pale male musicians he
painted. He was a murderer who spent the last months of his life on
the lam. Even on the run he had enough friends in high places to be
made a Knight of Malta, an honor stripped from him after an
involvement in a Malta brawl. Pardoned by the pope, he was
returning to Rome when he died, somewhat mysteriously, in the
summer of 1610.
</P>
<P>
   Book-worthy? You bet. But Langdon resists sensationalism in
favor of facts. Alas, the facts are few. You sense her frustration
at cold trails and missing evidence. Consider a sentence that
starts with an exasperated ``It is extremely unclear what he was
doing through this period, and no paintings remain . . .'' She's
obviously a zealous researcher; he, the most elusive of artists. In
a sense, author and subject are as much at odds as the protagonists
in Caravaggio's ``Judith and Holofernes,'' with its self-righteous
Judith sawing methodically through Holofernes' neck, undaunted by
the blood spurting forth. You can almost imagine it's Langdon,
getting even with Caravaggio at the lack of solid info he left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she soldiers on, providing a long account of a short
life. Her strong suits here are two. One is her descriptions of the
paintings, many of which are reproduced in color _ in very small
scale, unfortunately. The other is the elaborate context she
creates. She explains how patronage and building projects operated
in papal Rome, and explains the temper of the times. Sure,
Caravaggio was violent, but he lived in an age of gangs and
murders. His behavior was typical. He also lived in an age of
feverish gambling among low-life types and huge interest in music
among the intelligentsia. His paintings of card sharps and
lutenists didn't come out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   About those lutenists. Langdon doesn't buy the argument that the
provocative boys in Caravaggio's paintings are evidence of his
homosexuality. She traces that notion to a 17th-century English
traveler's spurious jottings, and to English tourists who were, she
writes, ``so convinced that sodomy was a favorite Italian
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment he picked up a paintbrush, Caravaggio has gone
in and out of favor _ very quickly in his own era, at a slower pace
in subsequent centuries. He was a nonentity in the 1800s; his star
rose with a series of shows and studies in the 1950s. He's now
recognized as the most modern of 17th-century artists, perhaps the
only one who can make religion relevant to contemporary viewers.
That's what he did in his own day, when the Counter-Reformation was
fighting back against Protestant personal piety with images
designed to stun strays into submission.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church of Caravaggio's day _ whose princes
were among his greatest patrons _ advocated an accessible, clear,
emotionally stimulating style of painting. Langdon makes it sound
Norman Rockwell-ish, and offers a suitably bland example in
Scipione Pulzone's ``Holy Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Caravaggio, never bland, took this mandate and created the
painting equivalent of Shakespeare in modern dress. As models for
the saints, he used whores and riff-raff, clad in grubby street
clothes. His earthy naturalism fit Catholicism's aim of making
viewers identify with stories of the saints _ to the point of
self-flagellation. Caravaggio's canvases might not make
late-20th-century viewers beat their bare backs, but these images
can still make them weep.
</P>
<P>
   But Caravaggio took naturalism to an extreme. Some of his
paintings were rejected by the very people who had commissioned
them _ and were horrified with the results. The Discalced
Carmelites turned down Caravaggio's ``Dormition of the Virgin''
because the Virgin was dirty, swollen, barefoot, and obviously
modeled on a prostitute who was the artist's own lover. She was, in
short, not their idea of the Queen of Heaven. But other patrons
appreciated Caravaggio's shock tactics: Their co-opting of his
radicalism was a little like what might have happened if the
National Endowment for the Arts had harnessed Robert Mapplethorpe
instead of reviling him.
</P>
<P>
   For all its downplaying of sensationalism, Langdon's book is
strong on stranger-than-fiction truths like the preparations for
the Jubilee Year of 1600, including stepped-up schedules of torture
and public executions in anticipation of the apocalpytic date.
Langdon makes you glad to live in 1999 instead of 1599: The threat
of Y2K is nothing compared with this frenzy in the name of
holiness.
</P>
<P>
   Crammed with detail, Langdon's biography lacks shape;
everything's given equal weight. Desmond Seward's ``Caravaggio: A
Passionate Life'' (Morrow, 1998) is half the length, twice as
focused, and a more entertaining read, while not going off the deep
end of salaciousness _ easy to do, in writing about Caravaggio. And
for something that's all mood and no information, there's Jarman's
movie, shot in the close-up, claustrophobic style of one of
Caravaggio's paintings, even borrowing the painter's rich, dark
palette and tenebrous shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Mysteries about Caravaggio persist. What about those paintings
that disappeared during World War II? At present, there are only 50
or so works that experts accept as by his hand. One, the star of
the recent BC show, was thought to be by Gerard Honthorst until the
Dublin Jesuits who own it sent it out for a cleaning that revealed
its true identity. This kind of revelation is what keeps scholars _
and the public _ enthralled with the painter whose brush could
describe wanton pleasures and then produce pictures that are still
sublimely persuasive arguments for the Christian faith. In the
Jesuits' nocturnal ``The Taking of Christ,'' the figure of the
artist himself is at the right, holding up a lantern. It is not
only a key moment in Christianity that he illuminates, Langdon
points out. ``His holding of the light was an evangelical call to
younger artists,'' she writes, ``a revelation of the true path to
follow, a symbol of the rebirth of painting.''

SAVVY SALMA HAYEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Refusing to take no for an answer is never a
bad career move. Ask Salma Hayek. It helped Hayek that she could
say no in a couple of languages to people who said no to her, first
in her native Mexico, then, repeatedly, in Los Angeles. But ever
since she achieved high visibility in Robert Rodriguez's
``Desperado,'' she's been saying yes a lot. Her profile will be
higher than ever this week when she opens opposite Will Smith and
Kevin Kline in ``The Wild Wild West,'' a high-stakes summer entry
that straddles the comedy and action genres.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Hayek elaborates between cups of coffee at the Palm Beach
Film Festival, where she's part of the awards scene, it's an action
adventure Western comedy. ``Oh yeah, and a musical. We all get a
number in this,'' she says. ``I get to sing, Kevin gets to sing,
and Will gets to dance. I play a woman way out of her league, in
1867, pretending to be someone else, looking for somebody who's
really trouble. So she attaches herself to this duo, and they both
get crushes on her. She's sort of like a Marilyn Monroe character.
She thinks she knows what she's doing, but she hasn't got a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   The toughest part of the shoot wasn't the heat, Hayek says, or
traveling all over the West. She loved trying out a German accent
the script called on her to use in Utah. She loved the shopping in
Santa Fe. ``Toughest was the corset,'' she says. ``It was one of
those 19th-century corsets with all these buttons and strings
attached to them. I did all my own stunts. That was fun. I wished
they had more. It made me feel like one of the boys. I was such a
girl in the film, but I tell you, the best stuff was rolling around
the floor of a train at high velocity with Kevin Kline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest torment, though, was when I had to do the music
video with Will Smith.'' Smith sells a lot of records, which in
turn sell his films. ``I didn't have to, but I wanted to. We did
the video for a song that he wrote for the movie. For it, they put
tarantulas on me, real ones, like crawling all over my neck and
stuff. But the song's worth it.'' Plus, it provides Hayek with a
wonderful metaphor for the movie business. Not, she notes, that
there was anything else she ever wanted to do since she was growing
up in the Mexican town of Coatzacoalcos. ``Going through puberty, I
pretended that I had given up. I went to college and majored in
political science. But then I got fed up with the lying and
pretending.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly soaps
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Hayek broke the news to her parents, who took it well, she
says, and got her first acting job doing children's theater in
Mexico City. Then came a TV soap opera that thrust her into a
prominence that weirded her out. ``Overnight I became very
successful because that was the No. 1 show. But nobody in my house
ever watched TV. Actually, my mom is antisoap. I had no idea what I
was doing and I said I was going back to theater because it was a
more healthy environment and I was still forming as an actress. I
picked an Alan Ayckbourn play so that I wouldn't be the star. But
people would come to see me and they would bring big cardboards
saying `I love you, Teresa,' which was the name of my character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody goes to see theater in Mexico. It is dying. But this
play sold out. Producers were seating people in the aisles. I
thought I was going on a journey of learning about myself, but this
was making the journey very confusing, so I decided to leave. I
packed my two bags, left the play in the middle of my contract, and
came to Los Angeles. I went to the Stella Adler conservatory and
was very fortunate because I got to take the last class Stella
Adler taught before she died. But I could not speak English well.
Often I couldn't understand what my homework was for the next day.
I would spend hours in the library in front of a huge dictionary,
and it would take me five times as long as anyone else because I'm
dyslexic.
</P>
<P>
   ``But little by little, I started getting better. Then I did
scenes from Shakespeare _ `Taming of the Shrew,' `Hamlet,' `Romeo
and Juliet,' `As You Like It.' In one way, it was very hard because
the dictionary didn't have words like `goest.' But I also found
Shakespeare the closest thing to the Latin world. The way he
approached language has a lot of Spanish qualities, the rhythm, the
way he sings it. Normally, when I try to speak English, I try to
diminish my accent and talk flat. But with Shakespeare it was
talking the way I normally talk. I could even move my hands and it
felt like part of the dance. Once I could understand the meaning of
the words, I found a home in Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   To her surprise, Hayek found more of a home in Shakespeare than
she did in Los Angeles or, initially, in the movie business.
``Everybody tried to make me see how wrong and crazy I was,'' she
says. ``Everybody thought I was so out of my league. In Hollywood
were the first ones to try and discourage me. `Go back,' they said,
`you have no future here.' Finally, I got some roles in television.
But coming from a Spanish-speaking background put me out of the
running for every role except prostitutes and maids, to the point
where people would see my name and picture and would want to meet
me, and then they would realize I was Mexican and would send me
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I would tell them my grandfather is Lebanese, they would
say, `Pretend you're Lebanese.' Not that it's OK to be Lebanese.
But it's a little better than to be a Mexican. In the end, I don't
have to overcome prejudice. They have to overcome the prejudice. I
have a different type of conviction. And I don't take no for an
answer. And because of that, I think it has opened the eyes of some
people to perceive things as I see them. It's the accomplishment of
the industry for beginning to see it, and of me, for not giving up.
A lot of people become what they have been told they are. But I
don't, and I never will. I'm as stubborn as a mule. I'm the last
one to set myself up as a role model of any kind, because I did
things in a crazy way. I don't want anyone to imitate me. But it
can be done. It can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sold on ``Dogma''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because Hayek appreciates stubbornness, and mavericks, she
signed on for a role in Kevin Smith's ``Dogma,'' which although yet
to be released has aroused considerable controversy with its
contemporary retelling of the Christ story. ``It's very pro-God,''
Hayek says. ``We all knew it was a cause going in. My role is the
most incredible character. Are you ready for this? I play a muse
who is fed up with everybody talking about Mozart and Shakespeare
and all these grand people of the world and she gets no credit or
recognition. So she asks God to be allowed to come to earth to try
for her own fame and fortune as a writer. But when she gets here,
because she has no muse, she gets writer's block. And she ends up
having another mission on earth that she was not counting on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayek also harnesses her visibility-raising energies on behalf
of Mexico. She's proud of the first film she made there, ``Midoq
Alley,'' based on a work by Nobel Prize-winning Naguib Mahfouz.
She's even prouder to have produced a new film of Nobel laureate
Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ``Nobody Writes to the Colonel,'' by
leading Mexican filmmaker Arturo Ripstein (she plays a small role
in it, too). Hayek also is developing a long-gestating film about
Frida Kahlo (1907-54), the legendary Mexican painter and feminist
icon.
</P>
<P>
   Hayek has headed her own production company, Ventanarosa, for
several years. She just signed a deal with Columbia to produce TV
programming in English and Spanish. Her first project is a series
about the lives of the saints. ``It's an experiment,'' Hayek says.
``They're reenactments, but the people don't talk, which I think
works very well, because special people like that you don't want to
hear their voices. You want to know their stories, and you'll see
them. Voice-overs will tell you the story. Therefore you can do it
in any language and show it in different countries. Friends are
helping me, like Antonio Banderas and (directors) Afonso Cuaron and
Guillermo Del Toro. Outrageous, wonderful stories! Not from a
religious point of view, but from an anthropological and dramatic
point of view. I'm not in them in any way whatsoever,'' Hayek says.
But the diminutive Hayek, energized and focused, is in the biz for
the long haul.

THIS BUD'S FOR YOU, BUT WHAT ABOUT BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bud Selig usually has to hold the cab door open
for his fellow commissioners. Well, OK, maybe Gary Bettman is
driving the cab, but Selig has been looking up at David Stern and
Paul Tagliabue for a long time, and for a lot of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Tags had all the money and the TV ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Stern had Larry Bird and Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan and
all the TV ratings Tagliabue couldn't use. Even Bettman had Wayne
Gretzky and Mario Lemieux and the Stanley Cup playoffs, and lots of
markets into which to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Bud? He had a few strikes and lockouts, his own team faded
further and further from the national scene, he had dwindling
ratings and runaway payrolls and owners as pliant and cooperative
as the bronze statue of Stan Musial outside Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Being Bud, in short, wasn't a whole lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   But now look. Tags' ratings are down, and so is his sport's
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, his spare time is spent keeping both sets of DeBartolos
away from the family knife drawer.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman's own sport no longer has Gretzky or Lemieux, it nearly
lost a team to a bankruptcy court, its scoring is down to mid-'60s
levels with no apparent solution despite a string of new rules
announced the day after a hugely controversial Cup final in which
he looked particularly silly.
</P>
<P>
   And Stern's sport is just finishing up a strike-mangled year, no
more Jordan and yet another
lowest-scoring-since-the-Eisenhower-administration playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Being Bud seems like an OK deal after all now.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, he's still got the odd troubled franchise, including
one that is only two years old, and his beloved Brewers are
currently the only sixth-place team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But scoring? Bud's got all the scoring he could want. In fact,
he's got slow-pitch softball scoring, and is one more expansion
away from out-and-out T-ball. The Colorado Rockies went through an
eight- game stretch this past week in which they scored
double-digit runs in six, and lost twice. And nobody thought
anything of it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the games are longer than they've ever been (the Indians
are averaging three-hour, 12-minute games, and the Giants are
second at 3:08), and teams now are routinely filling half their
roster spots with pitchers because good ones are so hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody says the games are boring any more.
</P>
<P>
   For this, the owners, and Bud by extension, should be commended.
They spent a good $7 billion or so of other people's money building
stadiums smaller and cozier than their antecedents. In the last
decade, new parks have been or will be built in Atlanta, Baltimore,
Boston, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas- Fort Worth, Denver, Detroit,
Houston, Milwaukee, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Diego, Seattle and of
course, our little burg, which spent a huge hunk of a bank's money.
None of these edifices are being called pitchers' parks.
</P>
<P>
   They also spent year upon year supervising the development of
the titanium/kryptonite alloy added to the baseballs to make them
scream, and watching as the umpires shrank the strike zone smaller
than a Big Mama Thornton commemorative postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   They viewed with interest but no intervention as pitchers were
transformed into the finest Dresden china, spared the rigors of
four-man rotations and seven-inning starts. They whistled with
admiration the development of Coors Field as the launchingest pad
baseball has seen since the Phillies played in Baker Bowl in the
'30s (280 down the line in right, 300 to the alley in
right-center).
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they did over a great expanse of time what the
other three leagues have yet to do _ change the size and shape of
the playing surface, change the ball used and actively legislate
against the defense. More than that, they changed the culture of
those who played the game, although in fairness that was largely by
accident and owes much to the introduction of the metal bat in all
other forms of ball.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, and no matter how the credit is divided,
Bud Selig no longer has to be ashamed of his sport's product. There
is scoring like never before, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa are folk
heroes, and Derek Jeter is being positioned by marketers and scouts
alike as the Griffey-Jordan combo plate.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he is no longer going to have to get the door for David
Stern. Tags, of course, is another story, but we trust Bud will get
there, even if he has to live to be 135.
</P>
<P>
   Which, we suspect, he probably will, even if only to see the
look on Don Fehr's face when he does.

ivy dermatitis is not so easy to avoid, but prevention is possible.
When that fails, quick recognition of an outbreak and appropriate

 &HT;    RedBone Press gives life to works of black gays and lesbians
 &HT;    By Shilanda Woolridge
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you are a gay black woman with a story to
tell, how can you get it printed in a tight publishing industry?
You do what Lisa C. Moore did. You start your own press.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Moore went looking for lesbian coming out
stories to buy for a friend and found ``a sprinkling of stories
here and there, but no books specifically for black women.''
</P>
<P>
   At first she planned only to self-publish the anthology she had
created called ``does your mama know?'' But Moore, then in her
early 30s, quickly realized that she liked publishing, and felt her
degree in business from Louisiana State University, followed by one
in journalism, had given her the skills to run a press. The result
was RedBone Press, now based in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Moore did everything on the press herself, from soliciting the
submissions to packing and shipping the book after it was printed.
She accomplished all of this while working as a part-time copy
editor at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, doing freelance
writing, and raising her 2-year-old nephew.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of '97, Moore took ``does your mama know?'' on an
extensive reading and signing tour, visiting 18 cities where the
authors lived. All of the readings took place at independent and
feminist bookstores. The following June, the book won two Lambda
Literary Awards _ the Academy Awards of gay and lesbian writing.
With its initial print run of 3,000 sold out, the anthology has
gone back to press twice more.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance to the University of Texas graduate program to study
Anthropology in the African Diasapora (specifically, cultural links
between her native New Orleans, and Haiti and Cuba) brought Moore
to Austin. She teamed up with Austin's Sharon Bridgforth of the
Root Wy'mn Theatre company, and released Bridgforth's first book
``the bull-jean stories'' in October '98. Bull-jean is the name of
a mythical Southern black lesbian living in the '20s, the
``single'' aunt that everyone knows and loves but never discusses.
</P>
<P>
   On April 29, ``the bull-jean stories'' was awarded a 1998 Lambda
Literary Award for best small press, netting RedBone Press its
third Lambda Award. A week earlier, a CD version of ``the bull-jean
stories'' was released by RedBone Press.
</P>
<P>
   RedBone has two more books planned for the coming year. Moore
will edit the ``Black PFLAG'' book, which will contain interviews
of parents, friends, and relatives of black gays and lesbians. ``I
think it's probably a cultural thing when black people say, `Oh,
that's a white thing to be gay.' The ``Black PFLAG'' book is a book
for the straight people, to get their take on what it's like to
have a black gay person in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   The other will be a book on black gays and lesbians dealing with
religion and spirituality. ``The editors are planning on going onto
gospel radio shows on Sunday and going to churches,'' Moore said.
``I said, `You guys are bold!'''
</P>
<P>
   Moore should include herself in her description of boldness. Her
position at the helm of RedBone press Press will impact the lives
of many people, gay and straight, as her books reach this
previously hidden market.

FIGHTING THE RETURN OF FOUL AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Everybody who likes to take a breath without
choking should be relieved that Carol Browner knows how to fight as
well as make sound policy.
</P>
<P>
   This week the head of the Environmental Protection Agency will
fight a federal appeals court panel's ruling that would gut tougher
clean air standards based on the latest generally accepted
scientific evidence of the dangers ozone (smog) and fine,
particulate matter (soot) pose to healthy lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite two years ago, the EPA received several petitions from
Eastern states seeking relief from ozone pollution originating
elsewhere. This month, the agency acted to make sure that this
relief is granted without the kind of legal train wreck that has
for the moment stopped a more comprehensive approach to harmful
levels of smog and soot.
</P>
<P>
   Browner was able to do this by using an older standard for
permissible levels of smog, providing a legally unassailable basis
for action. That meant that she could approve petitions from New
York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, while
continuing to review the status of Maryland, New Jersey, and
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Fine and dandy. But that still leaves the pending litigation. At
stake is the integrity of the Clean Air Act itself and nearly 30
years of judicially untouched decision-making under five presidents
and 15 Congresses that has updated and strengthened the law three
times.
</P>
<P>
   Also at stake is a logical concept of governance that has stood
the tests of time and litigation for nearly three generations,
since the beginning of the New Deal _ that Congress can delegate
specific rule-making authority to federal agencies under broad
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the second generation of robber barons was seeking to
evade basic responsibilities to American workers and consumers has
serious attention been paid to the lame argument that regulatory
authority is illegitimate unless exercised solely by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But give or take a nuance or two, that is exactly what a divided
appeals court panel here ruled this spring, blithely overturning
more than 60 years of precedent and practice as well as the EPA's
comprehensive reponsive to smog and soot. Presumably the
government's appeal will now go to the full court in the
expectation that a dangerous attempt at radical activism will be
stopped cold.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate impact of the panel's action is on a central
portion of the Clean Air Act _ that the EPA just set air pollution
rules that protect public health, with a decent margin of safety,
based on the best scientific information available. Already, since
1970, the Act has reduced air pollution overall by nearly a third
even as population and economic growth have increased. And it has
virtually wiped out emissions of lead and cut soot by 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the job under the law was far from complete. Early in the
Clinton administration, a massive review of the science by an EPA
panel found smog and soot still at unhealthy levels for 125 million
people, one million of whom face respiratory trouble as a result,
and 15,000 of whom will die prematurely every year.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Browner battled successfully two years ago to toughen
the standards under the law. Her case was so powerful that there
was no serious move to soften, much less set aside, the standards.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, people who produce smog and soot for a living and their
most extreme allies in Congress went for the judicial back door.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the appeals court panel refused to accept the
major claims that there was anything flawed in the EPA's process or
that the science was inadequate or that the tie to adverse health
consequences wasn't shown. It said exactly the opposite. Instead,
it reached back to the dark ages to decide that Congress has
delegated powers only it can exercise _ a recipe in a complex
society for chaos.
</P>
<P>
   As Browner has noted, the stakes go beyond air pollution, to
standards affecting everything from water to food to lethal toxic
waste.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, she was right to press for an all-out assault on the
panel's ruling, and right to do what she could in the interim. And
at least 125 million pairs of fingers are crossed that this attempt
at upsetting one of the pillars of 20th century government is
crushed decisively.

ARRIVAL OF V-CHIP LETS PARENTS TUNE OUT UNWANTED TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The V-chip is here.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, televisions equipped with the device
have started appearing on store shelves. But some consumer groups
and parents foresee problems with the device that is being touted
as a tool for filtering unwanted programming from children's
television viewing.
</P>
<P>
   The V-chip will be in at least half of all new television sets
13 inches or larger on the market by Thursday, as required by the
1996 telecommunications act. By January, the device will be a
regular feature.
</P>
<P>
   At least 25 million new television sets are expected to be sold
within the next 18 months, according to Representative Edward J.
Markey, the Malden Democrat who drafted the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few months, tens of thousands of V-chip TVs will be
in homes all across America. Within a year, millions and millions
of Americans will own one,'' said Markey's spokesman, David
Moulton.
</P>
<P>
   Even if new televisions come equipped with a V-chip, millions of
families still own TVs without the device, said Andrew Schwartzman,
president of Media Access Project, a telecommunications law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the V-chip in one TV doesn't prevent kids from watching
a TV in the next room that doesn't have one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Televisions that are not equipped with the device can be
upgraded with the purchase of a V-chip box.
</P>
<P>
   V-chips block out selected programs by reading the ratings based
on viewer age and content that flash on the screen during the first
15 seconds of a program. The technology for the V-chip to read the
electronic ratings works the same way that close-captioned
information is transmitted.
</P>
<P>
   All V-chips require an access code, usually a four-digit number,
to activate or deactivate the device. Based on the television
ratings, parents can choose to block certain programs through the
V-chip by entering the code.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as you wouldn't tell anyone your ATM or calling-card PIN
number, you don't tell your kids the V-chip code,'' said Kathryn
Montgomery, president of Center for Media Education, a children's
advocacy group that has compiled a booklet to help parents
understand the V-chip. The pamphlet is available at
www.vchipeducation.org.
</P>
<P>
   However, several parents looking for television sets at one
store this week said they were not particularly interested.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelhadi El Tahir of New York, shopping with his two children,
ages 10 and 14, said although he agreed with the purpose of the
V-chip, he sees problems with the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blocking channels out will make children even more curious,''
El Tahir said. ``These days, children are more technically able,
and they'll find ways to get around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin James of Washington, who has a 4-year-old, said even if her
television was equipped with a V-chip, she would be reluctant to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you block out certain shows, there's always going to
be something that you missed,'' James said. ``You have to be like
God to catch everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Charren, a visiting scholar at the Harvard School of
Education and founder of Action for Children's Television, said she
believes parents will be more likely to use the V-chip after the
school shootings in Littleton, Colo., and the recent debate in
Congress about youth violence and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But Charren said the V-chip and the television ratings system
have their drawbacks. Because the V-chip, when activated,
automatically filters out programs based solely on the ratings,
certain beneficial shows could get censored, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Programs about the Civil Rights Movement or about war will get
flagged for violence,'' Charren said. ``But those programs are the
kind of things that parents might actually want their children to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Charren said the best way for parents to use the V-chip is to
talk to their children about the kinds of programs they want them
to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``V-chip or no V-chip, only parents can take care of their
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   V-chip advocates say the device can be an additional tool to
help parents monitor their children's television viewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The V-chip is not supposed to be a baby sitter,'' said Ann
Saybolt of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association,
which represents the TV makers. ``It's not a replacement for
parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take only a few years for these new televisions to
become a staple in American homes. According to the latest Census
Bureau statistics, 98 percent of all households have an average of
2.3 television sets each _ a total of about 223 million TVs. The
Center for Media Education estimates that about 25 percent of all
households purchase a new television every year.
</P>
<P>
   V-chip advocates attribute the initial hesitance of parents to
use V-chips on a lack of awareness. Federal Communications
Commissioner Gloria Tristani said many parents don't realize that
the technology is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we educate parents about the V-chip, they can't use it
to make educated choices for their children,'' Tristani said.
</P>
<P>
   In a random survey of 13 major electronics stores in the
Washington area, only one reported having customers ask about the
V-chip, and that was from a few shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Markey sent letters to top national
newspapers urging them to include both the age- and content-based
ratings in their TV listings.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of USA Today and the Boston Herald, most of
the nation's top-selling newspapers, including The Boston Globe,
carry only the age-based ratings, according to Markey. A Globe
spokesman said the editors are looking into the matter with the
syndicate that provides the daily listings to the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make the ratings as familiar to the parents as
the Nike `swoosh' is to the kids,'' Markey said.

AN ANSWER TO THE TENNIS CALL CONTROVERSY? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've ever seen a John McEnroe or Venus Williams temper
tantrum on the tennis court, you know that the accuracy of umpires'
line calls is often a controversial topic in professional tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Have a little sympathy for the umpires: Judging whether a 2
5/8-inch felt ball moving up to 110 m.p.h. made a thousandth of a
second's worth of contact with a two-inch stripe on the ground has
to be one of life's more difficult challenges.
</P>
<P>
   For years, inventors have been working on systems that would
automate the process, and some are in use in major tournaments.
Earlier this month, a small, five-year-old Sudbury, Mass. company
that has done sonar work for the US Navy won a patent for its own
system that it thinks could be much less expensive and more
reliable than others on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph R. Fisher, president of Signal Processing Systems, and
colleagues William C. Booth of Stow, Mass. and Francis E. McInnis
of Marlborough, Mass. won patent 5,908,361 for an ``automated
tennis line calling system.''
</P>
<P>
   One key innovation in Fisher's system is that it combines
wafer-thin coaxial wire sensors in the tape that marks the playing
area with a system of microphones mounted around the court. A
computer evaluates the unique sound characteristic of a ball
hitting the ground to determine where the ball bounced. That helps
filter out false sensor readings from the impacts of players' feet
or racquets.
</P>
<P>
   The system also includes sensors that reveal whether a ball hit
the top of the net _ a ``let'' that requires the server to serve
again _ and it can be used to chart where serves and shots landed
as an aid to trainers and sportscasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linesmen do a remarkably good job, but basically, they're
trying to do something that can't humanly be done,'' Fisher said of
the challenge to consistently judge whether a shot was in or out.
With the huge prizes offered in major tournaments, ``There's a lot
of money at stake potentially'' in getting calls right.
</P>
<P>
   One existing system, called Cyclops, uses light beams projected
along the back of the service box to judge whether serves were in
or out. Major tournaments including the US Open, Wimbledon and the
Australian and Italian national tournaments use it as a complement
to human officials.
</P>
<P>
   However, to avoid being set off by a player's foot, Cyclops must
be immediately turned off after each serve. And the cost of leasing
it typically runs to $20,000 per court for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Fisher is optimistic that once he gets enough
investors to help fund mass-manufacturing of his system, it could
be purchased outright for the same $20,000, declining to as little
as $3,000 a court once it could be produced in volume. And it could
reduce the expense of hiring and training as many as 11 officials
watching lines around the court in pro matches.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's company has installed prototypes for testing at the
Longwood Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill, Mass. and at Cape Cod
Academy in Osterville, Mass., and had US Tennis Association judges
up to the Cape two years ago to run tests. The only visible
difference is a small electronics box the size of a hardback book
mounted on the net post, plus tiny microphones in the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The USTA director of officials, Rich Kaufman, said he found
Fisher's system interesting, but cautioned: ``There have been
probably 6 to 8 major attempts to make a system like this, and most
of these systems have failed miserably.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much in its infancy, and they've come across so many
problems, that we're still pretty far away from getting to a
situation where we would then have the discussion of,
philosophically, do we think we should replace human beings with
machines?'' Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher acknowledges that ``not everybody thinks it would be good
for the game of tennis to have a computer call the lines.'' But he
thinks skeptics can be won over or persuaded to use it to
complement human eyes. Ultimately, he thinks, a big market might be
at tennis clubs where casual players might prefer trusting a
machine rather than their opponent's honor when it comes to
deciding whether their shot was in or out.

 (a and f coding)  
 BOSTON: ... uninsured patients.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The upshot is that revenue from treating privately insured
patients provides much less of a financial cushion for teaching
hospitals when Medicare cuts its payments.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the BBA decreed a 29 percent reduction between 1998
and 2002 in Medicare payments for ``indirect medication
education.'' These funds are intended to cover Medicare's share of
the special costs of being a teaching hospital _ not interns' and
residents' salaries, which come out of a separate fund, but the
amorphous expenses associated with having sicker patients, more
technology, and trainees involved in patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Medicare payments, these so-called IME funds had also
risen sharply in the 1990s, from $2.5 billion in 1990 to $4.6
billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When it was passed, the BBA was expected to cut Medicare
spending by $115 billion over what it would otherwise have been.
But in the first year and a half of the new regime, the slowdown in
Medicare spending ``was greater than expected,'' Gail Wilensky,
chairwoman of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission told the
Senate Finance Committee this month.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way the law is phased in, the deepest cuts have
not yet occurred. By hospital industry estimates, the BBA will cut
as much as $220 billion from Medicare spending between 1998 and
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress overshot the mark by almost double,'' said Thomas A.
Scully, chief executive of the Federation of American Health
Systems, whose members include for-profit hospitals. ``Congress did
not vote for $220 billion. Congress didn't intend that.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Congress could never have foreseen some of the reasons
why Medicare is spending so much less than expected. A good deal of
it, analysts said, is due to more scrupulous billing by hospitals _
an apparent reaction to the Clinton administration's campaign
against fraudulent billing and ``upcoding,'' in which providers
jack up reimbursement by billing for a more severe illness than
patients actually have. In this light, Medicare hospital payments
are now more in line with the true cost of serving patients.
</P>
<P>
   Taken by themselves, the 1997 Medicare changes will cut total
profit margins of hospitals by two percentage points by 2002, from
6.7 percent _ the highest point in 17 years _ to a relatively
healthy 4.7 percent, according to Guterman, who spent a decade as
deputy director of the federal agency that advises Congress on
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   However, if managed-care insurers continue to wring payment
concessions out of hospitals at recent rates, total hospital profit
margins could fall to 1.5 percent by 2002. Guterman called that ``a
very low margin that would pressure a considerable number of
hospitals.'' But, he pointed out, ``It looks like Medicare by
itself isn't a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   This analysis is gaining currency in Washington, adding to the
hospitals' burden as they lobby for a rollback _ or at least a
``pause'' _ in the BBA's Medicare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   When a delegation of Boston hospital executives visited the
capital recently, they got a reality check from Donna Shalala, the
US secretary of health and human services. ``Shalala's attitude
was: `The reason you guys are having trouble is that you negotiated
bad deals with HMOs, gave them too many discounts, and Medicare is
making up the difference,' '' said New England Medical Center's
O'Donnell, who was in the group.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Representative Peter Stark of California, the senior
Democrat on the Medicare subcommittee in the House, suggests that
hospitals look to private insurers, not Medicare, for more money.
Stark recently asked government auditors to investigate the source
of hospitals' financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, are Medicare fee-for-service payments
becoming just another way that we funnel money to the nation's HMOs
to ensure their profits?'' Stark wrote to the General Accounting
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such doubts, some on Capitol Hill think hospitals have a
shot at wringing limited relief out of Congress this year. To that
end, the American Hospital Association is waging what its policy
chief, Carmela Coyle, calls the largest lobbying campaign in
memory. Senators from states with large clusters of teaching
hospitals are on board, including Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy,
Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, Democrat of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good chance we'll get a bill this year that will put
some money back into Indirect Medical Education,'' said one senate
staffer. ``The academic medical centers have got themselves
organized in a way I've not seen in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if they succeed in this stopgap effort, the Mass.
Generals and Beth Israels and Mt. Sinais know they need to win a
much bigger debate if their teaching mission is to be secured in a
market-driven world. They need reliable support, on a broader base
than Medicare, for the costs of training the physicians of the
future. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Apprenticeship comes with a high price tag &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need good doctors and, therefore, everybody ought to
pay to train them,'' said Dr. David Blumenthal, director of MGH's
Institute of Health Policy. ``But we also need good lawyers, good
engineers, and good plumbers, and we don't have a public program to
train them.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, Blumenthal argues, is consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We allow lawyers to practice law immediately out of law
school, but we don't allow doctors to do that,'' he noted. ``We
require doctors to have minimum amounts of real-world experience.
Somebody has to pay for that apprenticeship.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical students pay tuition _ lots of it. (Weimersheimer, the
Boston Medical Center resident, is carrying $160,000 in medical
school debt.) After graduation, the newly minted physicians
subsidize the cost of their obligatory apprenticeship by taking
hospital training posts that pay $15 an hour _ or less _ for
60-hour workweeks _ or more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anyone who doubts the cost of residency training should
follow Team D on its morning rounds on MGH's Bigelow Building
medical wards.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Yiming Zhao, a second-year resident, launches the morning
routine at 8:15, accompanied by a half-dozen white-coated medical
students, interns, and residents. Meticulously reviewing each
patient's situation, they troop in and out of 17 rooms,
interviewing, poking, prodding, and consulting with each other on
the medical puzzles they encounter.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:25, Team D gathers over crullers and coffee in a
windowless conference room with two ``attendings,'' senior staff
physicians who go over each case, consider the possibilities, offer
advice. Then they all head off for more bedside consultations.
</P>
<P>
   It results in some of the best care anywhere, as well as
rigorous training, but no time-and-motion expert would call it the
most efficient way to take care of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Even less cost-effective _ but increasingly important in the
training of tomorrow's doctors _ is the clinical training that Dr.
Jeffrey Schnipper is just completing. After each patient interview,
Schnipper consults with his supervisor, Dr. John D. Goodson, and
the two of them then interview the patient together. From the way
his patients react to Schnipper's news that he is moving on to a
different training phase this month, it's clear they value the time
and attention they've had from the 28-year-old resident.
</P>
<P>
   But the examining room Schnipper occupies for the afternoon
could be more profitably used by a senior doctor who could see more
patients and bill for each encounter. Neither Medicare nor any
other agency _ and certainly not private insurers _ explicitly pay
for outpatient training. And practicing doctors are feeling so
pressured to see more patients in less time that it's hard to
recruit them for proctoring duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to move to a new system in which graduate medical
education is explicitly recognized and funded by all payers,''
Goodson says. ``It really is for the greater good.''
</P>
<P>
   There's widespread agreement that a better way is needed, but no
consensus on what it might be. All concur that the teaching
hospitals' ultimate goal _ a so-called all-payer system in which
private and government payers contribute a small tax to support
physician training _ will be an uphill political battle. That fight
won't even begin until after the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teaching hospitals will have to find their own ways
to sustain the academic enterprise while they compete for patients
and haggle with private insurers for higher payment rates. Somehow
they will, because anything else is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching is how we maintain our preeminence in the world,''
said MGH's Laurence Ronan. ``If we dismantle this system, it will
take 30 or 40 years to put it back together again.''

HOSPITALS TAKING A HIT FROM MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX AND AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON -- For a midsummer Friday night at Boston Medical
Center's emergency room, the city's busiest, it's unusually quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, chief resident Peter Weimersheimer ministers to 30
patients during his nine-hour shift _ crash victims, cases of hand
trauma, pneumonia sufferers, patients in psychiatric crisis, and
end-stage alcoholics, such as a 45-year-old vodka addict who says
he's been vomiting ``cups'' of blood but resists being admitted for
a complete workup until Weimersheimer explains that he is
``probably going to die'' if he doesn't stay.
</P>
<P>
   For his labors, Weimersheimer earns $15 an hour, about half what
he used to get as a carpenter and $5.37 short of a third-year
Boston Medical Center nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little dismayed at all the talk about cutting residents
when we're such a cheap source of labor for hospitals,''
Weimersheimer says. ``There's no way they could hire enough
attending physicians to replace us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting residents? It's hard to imagine at a time when Boston's
teaching hospitals are often full to the gunnels and nearly all of
them routinely have trouble finding a bed for one more patient.
</P>
<P>
   But these are no ordinary times. The outlook at the nation's
premier hospitals _ those, like Boston Medical Center and a dozen
others in the Boston area that train doctors and deal with
difficult cases _ is the darkest in memory, with no clear way back
to the light.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no plan to lay off interns and residents, who
have hospital commitments to complete three- and four-year training
programs, leaders of academic medicine expect to pare training
slots in the future. But other hospital jobs are in jeopardy as
teaching hospitals struggle to maintain what they call their unique
mission to train the next generations of physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General are
eliminating a total of 240 jobs to stem a joint operating loss of
$14.1 million for the first half of this year. That's a little more
than a third of the $39 million operating loss suffered by their
parent, Partners HealthCare, New England's largest hospital system.
(With investment income and other revenue, the system saw a net
profit of $2.4 million, compared to $30.4 million a year ago.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working our butts off and still losing money,'' said Dr.
Laurence Ronan, a staff doctor at Massachusetts General. ``We can't
continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, things are
even shakier. The institution has lost $38 million on operations so
far this year, and BI Deaconess is a much smaller operation than
Partners. ``We're scrambling behind the scenes to protect our
medical training programs,'' said Dr. Steven Weinberger, the
hospital's director of medical education.
</P>
<P>
   In Worcester, UMass Memorial Health Care has closed programs and
cut staff to trim $60 million in annual costs, and are still losing
money so far this year. To break even next year, officials say they
need to slash $70 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Can there be any doubt that hospitals are in trouble, especially
the teaching hospitals that are the undisputed crown jewels of US
health care?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are plenty of doubts, especially in Washington,
where the leaders of Boston health care are pinning their hopes for
a congressional reprieve from their fiscal difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics don't doubt that hospitals are losing money. But they
do question why, how bad it will get, and whether it's the federal
government's responsibility to do anything about it. And it's not
just fiscally conservative Republicans raising the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar is high, and we're not going to just go and give money
away because people say they're experiencing hardship,'' said
Daniel Mendelson, the senior health policy official in the White
House budget office. Despite the hospitals' complaints, ``we don't
see the systemic evidence that one might like to see before doing
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Clinton seems ready to support an idea that
would make the hospitals' hunt for money even harder. He is
expected to propose giving Medicare beneficiaries broad new
coverage for prescription drugs, a potentially costly idea that,
whatever its social merits, might siphon funds that could otherwise
go to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Congress agrees to boost health care spending overall,
Clinton's proposal ``would be very damaging'' to hospitals, said
Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dilemma has roots in act of Congress &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals didn't arrive at their current dilemma overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders blame their troubles on an act of Congress, the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which imposed the deepest cuts on
Medicare in the federal program's 35-year history. But there is
broad consensus among industry analysts that the hospitals' current
state resulted from forces set in motion early in this decade. The
problem is a complicated amalgam of:
</P>
<P>
   --Inadvertent Medicare overpayments, especially for inpatient
care;
</P>
<P>
   --The 1994 collapse of the Clinton health reform plan, which
many view as a lost opportunity to rationalize funding of teaching
hospitals' social missions;
</P>
<P>
   --A post-1994 unleashing of market forces in health care that
permitted managed care plans to extract deep discounts from
hospitals desperate to keep patients flowing their way.
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile for the drift to become clear to hospitals, some
observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1994 and 1997, things were looking pretty damn good
for teaching hospitals, and their Medicare profit margins were
especially good,'' said Dr. David Altman of the Lewin Group, a
health care consulting firm. ``There were some Cassandras saying
the sky was going to fall, but not everybody was listening during a
boom period.''
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, the Medicare overpayments seem especially striking
_ and unlikely to continue indefinitely at a time when bankruptcy
was forecast by 2008 for Medicare's Part A trust fund, which pays
for hospital care.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this decade, US teaching hospitals were
making $7 in ``profit'' for every $100 it cost them to provide
inpatient care to a Medicare patient, according to a recent
analysis by Stuart Guterman of the Urban Institute, a
Washington-based think tank. By contrast, community hospitals were
losing almost an equal amount on each Medicare patient in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Medicare profit margins for inpatient care at teaching
hospitals had ballooned to 28.4 percent, and nonteaching hospitals
were making a 12.4 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   The largesse stemmed from formulas built into federal law that
automatically update Medicare hospital payments to keep pace with
inflation. But hospital costs flattened in the 1990s, instead of
climbing steadily as the formulas assumed they would. ``Medicare
was a missile just cruising along with no controls,'' observed Dr.
Thomas O'Donnell, chief executive of New England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals point out that they lost money on Medicare outpatient
care. Outpatient margins dropped to a negative 12 percent in 1996,
and fell further to nearly twice that in 1998, according to the
American Hospital Association. But hospitals' total margins
remained in the black throughout the first seven years of the
decade, according to Guterman's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare overpayment on the inpatient side handed hospitals a
timely opportunity in the 1990s, although hospital executives don't
like to admit it. It allowed them to bid low for all-important
contracts with managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to hold onto market share they've cut very low-priced
deals with managed-care companies,'' said Stuart Altman, a Brandeis
University professor who served on a congressional Medicare reform
commission. This implicit Medicare subsidy of private insurers is
``an unfair and unsustainable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that hospitals have been caring for privately
insured patients at less than their actual costs, that has left
them especially vulnerable to erosion in Medicare payments. ``They
knew that Medicare was paying above costs, and you can say, `well,
they should have been prepared for this,' '' said Katharine London,
chief of policy development at the Massachusetts Division of Health
Care Finance and Policy. ``But they're in a very competitive
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Stuart Altman: ``I've been saying (to managed-care
executives) for some time that the only way they have been able to
squeeze down hospital payments is that hospitals have been filling
their pockets from Medicare. Will they be as successful if Medicare
cuts back?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Balanced budget a blow to teaching hospitals &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Medicare has cut back _ with a vengeance, some would say.
</P>
<P>
   As the name implies, Congress intended the Balanced Budget Act
of 1997 to balance the federal budget. With considerable help from
a booming economy, it did _ four years ahead of schedule, and with
spending cuts mostly derived from Medicare. Moreover, the law has
helped to postpone the day when Medicare's hospital trust fund will
run out of money to 2015, buying time for more systematic reform.
Or perhaps buying time to do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals are disproportionately affected by the BBA
because their older, sicker caseload makes them far more dependent
on Medicare than other hospitals. Medicare accounts for at least
half of a typical teaching hospital's inpatient revenues. In
addition, teaching hospitals are apt to have more Medicaid and
uninsured patients.

ON-LINE BANKING SHOULD BE DONE WITH CAUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd think Bob Kerwin would be clutching his old-fashioned
checkbook after his horrendous first experience paying a bill
through BankBoston's on-line banking system.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he still finds some benefits to using the bank's
HomeLink program. But he has learned the hard way _ through a
four-month ordeal that included mis-sent funds, dozens of
``customer-relations'' phone calls, conflicting explanations and a
temporarily canceled credit card _ that on-line banking has some
risks that are worth avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very selective about what bills I pay using HomeLink,''
said Kerwin, a 37-year-old software salesman.
</P>
<P>
   It was late February when Kerwin made his debut click with the
BankBoston's popular on-line banking system. He picked a relatively
simple transaction: He requested that a $300 check be drawn from
his BankBoston checking account and sent to his BankBoston Visa
account to pay a monthly bill.
</P>
<P>
   He figured it was an easy transaction, which would require only
one easily-cut check mailed directly to BankBoston Visa. Also, the
money essentially was being transferred within the same institution
and the amount was a nice flat sum.
</P>
<P>
   But about two weeks later, on March 13, BankBoston Visa informed
him that they never received his check. Because of nonpayment, the
credit card was temporarily shut off and marked delinquent.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Kerwin called the HomeLink program. It showed they
sent a $300 check to BankBoston Visa and the check cleared on March
3.
</P>
<P>
   What gives?
</P>
<P>
   After four months of an exhaustive, one-man crusade to correct
the problem, Kerwin discovered that his $300 check mistakenly went
to Fleet Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In April, he managed to get a clerk to give him a copy of the
cashed check. The ``payee endorsement'' section of the back of the
cashed check showed a stamp from Fleet Bank in Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Kerwin presented it to BankBoston officials, but it wasn't good
enough to get him off the hook. They declined to credit him $300 in
his checking or credit card accounts.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston Visa and HomeLink officials insisted they couldn't
fix the problem until they got the $300 back from Fleet, and, at
various times, suggested more investigation needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   As if it were some grand gesture of generosity, BankBoston Visa
officials told him in April they would no longer label his account
past-due and they would raise his credit limit from $7,000 to
$7,300.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out my $300 since the beginning of March,'' said
Kerwin, after e-mailing us for help. ``We're now at the end of
June. Why should I be out the money? It's not my mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   When we made some calls last week, BankBoston officials
confirmed the check mistakenly got into the hands of Fleet Bank in
a bizarre glitch that BankBoston officials say has nothing to do
with the proposed merger of the institutions.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston spokesman Bruce Spitzer said he has yet to figure out
the exact problem, but believes it was caused either by a coding
mistake or clerical problems at either the HomeLink or Visa
check-processing centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did go to Fleet, but we don't know how it got there,''
Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the face of the check says BankBoston Visa,
Fleet cashed the check and got the money.
</P>
<P>
   Kerwin said he's a reasonable guy and knows life is full of
innocent mistakes. But he is baffled at how long it has taken
BankBoston to correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the bank is issuing an apology to Kerwin about the
long ordeal and has credited his account $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret the amount of time it has taken to come up with the
answers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the bank has now set up Kerwin's HomeLink account
so that, in the future, Kerwin can transfer funds directly from his
checking account to his Visa account, eliminating any need to cut a
check. If you don't use this transfer system, the only way now to
pay such BankBoston Visa bills on-line is through individually cut
checks.
</P>
<P>
   He insists such problems are extremely rare with the HomeLink
program, which has 350,000 customers and 22 percent of the bank's
retail customers.
</P>
<P>
   For Kerwin, he's pleased to finally get his $300 and now feels
as if this sobering experience has taught him about the possible
drawbacks of the on-line banking world. He said he now uses on-line
banking only for registered vendors, such as some phone companies
or department stores that can receive HomeLink payments directly,
without the need for checks.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also thinks twice before using on-line banking for
big important bills, such as mortgage payments that have strict due
dates. He can't bear the thought of another lost check.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to hold onto his money longer. When HomeLink cuts
a check, your money is deducted almost immediately. It's sent into
limbo land, collecting no interest, until the payee cashes it. With
traditional checks, you hold onto the money until the check clears.
</P>
<P>
   Kerwin said he hopes this one consumer fiasco is his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I got my $300 back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defective stroller fiasco
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A mother of infant twins sent us a letter complaining that
Boston Baby in Newton, Mass. refused to exchange a defective
double-stroller she bought this year.
</P>
<P>
   As Kathryn Delhome puts it, she bought the Graco
double-stroller, called Duo Rider, last January at this baby
mega-store, along with $5,000 in baby furniture and car seats. She
didn't start using the stroller until the warm weather in April,
and within two months, the strap for one of the seats broke.
</P>
<P>
   When she pursued the problem with the store, the managers told
her to call Graco. When Delhome called Graco, the company said they
could ship her a new seat with a new strap, but she would probably
not get it until August. Furious, she went back to the store and
was again told it couldn't do a thing.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to state law, the store has direct responsibility
for bad goods. Merchants are allowed to set any refund policy they
want for nondefective goods, but they must refund, replace or
repair _ it's the customer's choice _ any defective merchandise
sold at their store, said assistant attorney general Diane
Szafarowicz.
</P>
<P>
   We called owner Harvey Slobodkian on Thursday, inquiring about
this case. He initially defended the store's actions, saying he
hadn't ruled out ``consumer abuse'' in explaining the broken strap.
He also said he found it difficult to talk to the couple because
they were so angry at him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, he said he would provide them with a new harness
at no charge for the stroller, or if necessary, he'd comply with
their request for a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   But Delhome said she's just going to wait for the Graco-shipped
seat because she doesn't want to re-enter Boston Baby. ``I don't
want to deal with the store again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Odds &AMP; ends
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Revenge for telemarketer calls. What do you do when a
telemarketing firm calls you repeatedly after you tell them to
stop? The answer is that you have legal recourse, but it's not
easy, state officials say. First, you must document as much as you
can, including dates and times of the calls and the name of the
company and callers. Tell them you want to be on their do-not-call
list. If you can prove the repeated calls caused you to incur at
least $50,000 in damages (such as getting tricked into a fraudulent
deal), you can sue in federal court under the telemarketing sales
law. If it was an automated-voice call, you can sue in small claims
court. But still the hassle falls in your lap. The best bet is
probably to call your state's attorney general's office with your
data. They have the power to bring action if they get repeated
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   --Phone fee increase. Four weeks ago we told you about a way for
low-volume phone users to avoid some of the fees popping up on
their long-distance bills. We suggested doing away with your
long-distance carrier and using a dial-around company (the 10-10
numbers), a prepaid calling card or an Internet calling system to
make your calls. At the time, the only fee involved with this
approach was a 53-cent-a-month charge to cover the cost of
long-distance access. Now we have learned that as of July 1, that
fee will rise to $1.04 for primary lines, $2.53 for nonprimary
lines. The increase cuts the amount of savings, but it still may
make sense. After all, fees assessed by long-distance companies are
also expected to rise.

PLAYERS PRESSURED BY THE CLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Too much time on their hands SGA officials need
to take up knitting or needlepoint and stop getting so antsy over
pace of play on the final day of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   There were Payne Stewart and Phil Mickelson ``on the clock,''
which is to say being timed because they'd fallen off the
USGA-prescribed pace, for the final holes at Pinehurst No. 2. By
the 16th hole, they were tied for the lead and tension was high.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if one of the players stood too long at his ball and
incurred a one-stroke penalty that cost him the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with being on the clock when you're in the last few
groups of a major championship,'' said Tiger Woods, who was being
timed in the next-to-last group. ``If somebody gets a bad time and
another bad time, that's a one-shot penalty. With the greens as
severe as they are ... it takes time to figure out the slopes. If I
understand the pace of play rule, there are exceptions to it.
</P>
<P>
   And by looking at these greens, I think that's a pretty good
exception.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that pace of play is a major problem in the early
rounds of the U.S. Open. Anyone playing in an afternoon threesome
on Thursday or Friday has to be prepared for a six-hour round.
</P>
<P>
   That was the pace on Friday, but then USGA officials began to
try to rush the later groups along so that they'd finish before
dark. There were many players trying to make the cut in a hurry,
even though those who had gone before them were able to take their
time.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't seem to be an issue at all if you're playing in the
last twosome on Sunday. After all, if you slow down, who cares
other than TV?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, now we're getting somewhere. Like those laggards on Friday,
the last group on Sunday has to finish before dark _ dark airtime,
in this case. And while you would like to think that the USGA
wouldn't really wallop a U.S. Open leader with a slow-play penalty
for the sake of NBC, the mere threat of one is bad enough.
</P>
<P>
   Woods gives the example of a shot he had last Saturday that
changed when the wind shifted. He went back to his bag to change
clubs, made his par and then was told he had a bad time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be tough to say, you know what, if I do it again I'm
going to get a one-shot penalty,'' Woods said, feeling he had done
the proper thing. ``And to lose the U.S. Open by one would be
pretty tough to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   ... The Senior PGA Tour is for men over 50, but the new LPGA
senior tour will be for women over 40. Just another example of how
women are perceived to be over the hill much earlier than are men,
and if you don't believe that, go to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ... Jack Nicklaus has declined his invitation to the British
Open this year because he feels his game hasn't recovered yet from
his hip replacement surgery. But he's gearing up for St. Andrews
next year as his last.
</P>
<P>
   ... Payne Stewart was jazzed about qualifying for September's
Ryder Cup matches and says he's the rah-rah type who'll take
teammates by the throat and get them going. ``Better not put his
hands around my throat,'' said David Duval, who is not so excited
about his first Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ... It's a big month for golf babies. Not only did Amanda Brynn
Mickelson arrive on Monday afternoon, around the time that
Stewart-Mickelson playoff would have begun, Pat Hurst had her first
child, a boy, on June 18.
</P>
<P>
   ... Juli Inkster celebrated her 39th birthday on Thursday with a
68 at the LPGA Championship. She's not quite over the hill, it
appears.

TOUGH TEST LIES AHEAD FOR GOP FRONT-RUNNER

(DUPLICATION ALERT: Story also moving in ``a'' general news
category) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On the face of it, California would seem like
friendly territory for Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Like Texas, it is a large state that shares a border with Mexico
and boasts a bustling high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   If the comparisons stopped there, Bush would have little to
worry about as he embarks this week on his first presidential
campaign swing to the vote-rich Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   But the political differences between Texas and California could
hardly be more stark.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has a Republican in every elected statewide office. In
California, where the Clinton-Gore team won in 1992 and 1996,
Democrats hold all the major statewide elected offices (the GOP
holds two lesser offices) and both houses of the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush won impressive numbers of Hispanic voters and
women in his 1998 re-election campaign, some experts say his
conservative positions on such issues as abortion, guns and the
environment could put him on the defensive with the California
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think California will be a real test for his message,'' said
Raphael Shonenshein, a political scientist at California State
University in Fullerton. ``People will easily decode style over
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush nevertheless has had an impressive start in California _
even before showing up.
</P>
<P>
   As in other states, Bush is far outpacing his Republican rivals
in California in money and in opinion polls. A recent Los Angeles
Times poll had Bush leading Elizabeth Dole 50-13, with other GOP
hopefuls stuck in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   A hypothetical matchup between Bush and Vice President Al Gore,
however, is much tighter. The Times poll showed Bush ahead 49-44,
but that is a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore recently completed his 57th visit to California, which
has been kind to his campaign coffers, generating more than $1
million in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is no slouch in California fund-raising circles, either.
The state has given him his second-highest number of dollars _
behind Texas _ and Bush has already had to move a Silicon Valley
fund-raiser scheduled for next week to a new location because the
first site could not hold everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Beckwith, a Bush spokesman, predicted that the governor
will pull in a whopping $3 million during the three-day swing,
which will squeeze in at least seven fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valley has historically been pretty apolitical,'' said
Floyd Kvamme, a Bush backer and member of the Technology Network, a
group of high-tech companies that have banded together to advance
their political agenda. ``An awful lot of companies are realizing
we're not going to escape notice any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kvamme is one of many high-tech executives who have met with
Bush in Austin. Months ago, Bush strategist Karl Rove helped
organize several meetings with computer executives, many of whom
have joined the California fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous number of our people have operations in Texas,
either in Dallas-Fort Worth or in the Austin area,'' Kvamme said.
``They've seen what's happened in Texas and they like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters say the high-tech angle provides the governor
with an opportunity to favorably contrast himself with Gore, who
has developed strong ties to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   One issue is the wave of lawsuits that could stem from the Y2K
bug, a widespread programming glitch that is expected to cause many
computers to fail because they will recognize the year 2000 as
1900.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are eager to use that issue to drive a wedge between
Gore and a top source of Democratic campaign money, trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed a bill in Texas limiting business liability for the
Y2K bug; the Clinton administration has voiced objections to
legislation in Congress limiting liability.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Silicon Valley, the Bush camp is hoping that his
``compassionate conservatism'' and Texas-tested appeal to Hispanics
will help attract voters who have been turned off to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who criticized a California initiative aimed at cutting
off education to the children of undocumented immigrants, won about
40 percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas last year, polling data
show.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Leonard, a California assemblyman representing the area
between Los Angeles and Palm Springs, called Bush a ``natural'' who
is more like Ronald Reagan (a former California governor) than his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``His compassionate conservatism is the same kind of optimism
and confidence in the future of America,'' Leonard said. ``He has
said some of the most conservative things that have ever been said
on the national stage, but he has said it with a smile on his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, say that by the time Californians find out
more about Bush, support for him will drop precipitously.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the National Abortion Rights Action League is
announcing an Internet-based advertising campaign ``exposing Bush's
`two-step' on abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that he supports the concept of a constitutional
amendment outlawing abortion but that most Americans are not ready
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll pay a price in California on the abortion issue,'' said
Bob Mulholland, spokesman for the California Democratic Party. ``He
doesn't fit California. He's from Texas, and he doesn't support a
woman's right to choose. California is the most pro-choice state in
the union.''

BACKLASH LOWERS EXPECTATIONS FOR `WILD WILD WEST'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(This moved late Friday on ``e'' entertainment wire)  
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They were supposed to see ``The Matrix.'' That's
what they had been told, at least. So when a Warner Bros. marketing
executive told a recruited audience of 15- to 35-year-old men in
Redwood City, Calif., that they would be seeing ``the new Will
Smith comedy'' instead, the crowd went ballistic. Many were still
booing when the lights went down.
</P>
<P>
   The deception had been intentional. Warner Bros. executives
didn't want director Barry Sonnenfeld to show his new would-be
Fourth of July blockbuster, ``Wild Wild West,'' to a test audience.
Sonnenfeld balked, saying he needed an audience in order to gauge
the movie's effectiveness. Warner Bros., in turn, tried to keep the
screening a secret by advertising it as a ``Matrix'' preview. That
or they just wanted to see how the movie would rate with young
males.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went one step further in terms of dumbness,'' says
Sonnenfeld, director of such previous hits as the ``Men in Black,''
``Get Shorty'' and the ``Addams Family'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy backfired when word of the disastrously low test
scores leaked on the Internet. Soon afterward, there were reports
that Sonnenfeld recalled the film's stars, Will Smith and Kevin
Kline, for 10 days of additional shooting to punch up the movie's
comedy. And there were whispers that the picture's budget,
originally south of the $100 million line, had spun out of control.
Never mind that most visual-effects films test poorly and that
movies routinely go back for reshoots. Ignore, too, the fact that
none of the anonymous sources quoted in stories about the ``Wild
Wild West'' budget would have any real knowledge of how far the
film was over budget. (Most reports pin the final figure around
$125 million.)
</P>
<P>
   The stigma had stuck. ``Wild Wild West,'' the big-screen remake
of the popular '60s TV series, has been branded as this year's
``Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell,'' says Paul Dergarabedian, president of the
box-office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations Co. ``Certainly, it
has a lot of insurance with Will Smith and his Fourth of July track
record. After that opening weekend, however, it will be up to the
word-of-mouth. And right now that's rather mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Such guarded optimism is a step down from the sky-high
expectations that led Warner Bros. to take out advertisements last
July 4 proclaiming: ``Enjoy this year's Fourth of July. Next year,
it's going to be `Wild!''' The ads were actually Sonnenfeld's idea,
and he now admits they may have been ill-conceived.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it did was put a target on the film's back,'' Sonnenfeld
says. ``It was like we were inviting people to do mean things to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, I wanted Warner Bros. to commit that `Wild Wild
West' was going to be their big summer movie,'' the director
continues. ``At the time, they were also planning on making
`Superman' with Nic Cage and Tim Burton. And I wanted them to give
`Wild Wild West' top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who plays James West (he of the tight pants) to Kline's
Artemus Gordon (master of disguise), upped the ante by repeatedly
calling the July 4 weekend ``Big Willie Weekend.'' Not that Smith
doesn't have history on his side. He starred in ``Independence
Day'' (1996) and ``Men in Black'' (1997), both of which opened on
the Fourth of July weekend and went on to win the summer box-office
crown.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to back down from a challenge, Smith compares the
film's naysayers to people in the rap world _ ``playa hatas,''
Smith says _ who deride rappers for their mainstream success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing with `Big Willie Weekend' was me coming out
and having fun with the spectacle,'' Smith says. ``But you have
some people who don't like you to have fun or be successful, so
they try to knock you down.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance,'' Smith says, ``one newspaper printed a lie that
they knew was a lie, about how the `Wild Wild West' budget was $200
million. They know it's not true, but they still print it. It kind
of hurt my feelings a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith will probably recover. After all, the ``Wild Wild West''
soundtrack, featuring Smith rapping the movie's title song, is
already a monster hit. And despite the bad buzz surrounding the
film, most expect it to do OK.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Armageddon' wasn't exactly a critical favorite last summer,
but people still went to see it,'' Exhibitor Relations'
Dergarabedian says.
</P>
<P>
   The movie itself follows the ``Men in Black'' buddy concept,
pairing Smith and Klein in an Old West that mixes James Bond
gadgets with Jules Verne science fiction. Kenneth Branagh plays the
villain, Dr. Loveless, a scientist threatening to overthrow the
U.S. government with a steam-driven 80-foot mechanical tarantula.
Salma Hayek is on hand as the scantily clad (token) love interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a romp, a summer entertainment,'' says Kline, an actor
rarely seen in such films. ``You leave your mind out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the inauspicious test screening, Sonnenfeld decided that
the movie needed more physical comedy and fewer explosions. He shot
two new scenes with Smith and Klein and added a pre-title sequence
where a flying rotary blade chases a terrified scientist through
tall grass.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to reshoot what Sonnenfeld euphemistically calls
``additional photography'' is pretty much standard procedure for
big-budget movies. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' was
altered significantly after test screenings, and Adam Sandler's
``Big Daddy'' was retooled with a completely new ending.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Men in Black,'' Sonnenfeld tossed out the original finale
some 16 weeks into production because he felt the movie lacked
``oomph.'' His new ending: Angry bug swallows Tommy Lee Jones;
Smith blows up bug to save Jones. To achieve this, Sonnenfeld
ordered 45 3-D computer graphics shots, scrapping a $1 million
mechanical bug model designed by Rick Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Says Sonnenfeld: ``You could have written: ```Men in Black''
throws out ending at last minute in a desperate attempt to save the
movie.' Or you could shut up and not do anything and wait and
discover the movie. At the time, we were so under-the-radar that no
one noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, Sonnenfeld didn't take out an advertisement promoting
``Men in Black'' a year before it was released. Big Willie Weekend
hadn't become an American institution. And Internet movie sites
weren't posting terrible advance reviews, which isn't the case with
``Wild Wild West.''
</P>
<P>
   (Sample item from Harry Knowles' popular aint-it-cool-news.com:
``The film wasn't bad. It was godawful.'' Knowles himself, usually
an optimist when it comes to movies, weighed in about ``Wild Wild
West,'' writing, ``I don't think this is a project that's gonna be
saved.'')
</P>
<P>
   To which Sonnenfeld says: ``The Internet is going to screw up
moviemaking, and I really resent that. It's dangerous because it's
all anonymous. These reports are making studios afraid of having
advance screenings because if the buzz is bad, it kills you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What other form of art gets judged before the final product?''
Sonnenfeld continues. ``I don't read reviewers talking about I.M.
Pei's design for the CAA (Creative Artists Agency) building. I
don't hear someone say, `I read the first draft of `Bonfire of the
Vanities,' and it's 1,900 pages long. But everyone gets to be an
expert on movies.''
</P>
<P>
   That's unlikely to change given the general public's
ever-increasing appetites for the Internet and movie gossip.
Sonnenfeld realizes this and already has a tongue-in-cheek plan in
place for his next film, a biopic of boxer Muhammad Ali that will
once again team the director with Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we have a start date _ and I've talked to (Columbia
Pictures distribution president) Jeff Blake about this _ I want to
hold a press conference to announce to everyone that the budget of
the movie is $500 million, that the shooting schedule is 18 months
and that we are building into the production 16 weeks of additional
photography.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenfeld pauses, considering if he has left out anything.
``That about covers it. What could they make a stink about then?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question he really doesn't want answered. &QL;

SINGER-SONGWRITER HAS HIS OWN FOLLOWING 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(This moved late Friday on ``e'' entertainment wire)  
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His albums consistently garner raves. He's an
amazing guitarist. His songs feature sophisticated lyrics and
clever melodies. He's been praised by other musicians and
songwriters, most notably with a 1994 tribute album, ``Beat the
Retreat,'' that includes performances of his songs by R.E.M.,
Bonnie Raitt, Los Lobos and others. Yet after more than 30 years in
the business and more than 20 as a solo artist, Richard Thompson is
hardly a household name, especially in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't my best town. It's a funny, fickle town,'' says
Thompson, whose deadpan sense of humor extends beyond his songs.
``I can do three times the business in San Francisco. I can sell
out 2,000 seats in Boulder, Colo. It's just a funny town.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson, who makes his home in Pacific Palisades part of
the year and London the rest, will be playing with a five-piece
band to a sold-out house at the Roxy on Wednesday as part of a
small tour that he calls advance promotion for his new album,
``Mock Tudor,'' which comes out in August.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for Thompson's inability to go beyond cult
status _ though it's a very big cult status, with his albums
selling in the hundreds of thousands rather than millions _ is his
lack of radio play. Despite catchy hooks and memorable choruses,
Thompson's songs are often too edgy _ and even adult _ to fit into
most radio formats.
</P>
<P>
   Take a song like ``I Feel So Good'' from his 1991 album ``Rumor
and Sigh.'' It's a jaunty tune with a fun guitar hook. But the
first verse is ``I feel so good I'm going to break somebody's heart
tonight/ I feel so good I'm going to take someone apart tonight/
They put me in jail for my deviant ways ...'' and there you know
you're not in pop radio territory anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to stick the jokes into the darker songs, or kind of
have an ironic content to the darker songs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Working in what he calls the folk tradition of making up
fictional stories, Thompson has explored the subject of
relationships and love from seemingly every possible angle _ from
the more grotesque, like ``I Feel So Good,'' to a tender and
beautiful ballad like ``Beeswing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A love song can encompass a lot of things _ politics,
spirituality,'' says the 50-year-old Thompson. ``Just generally,
the subject of relationships is a very broad one. To do it justice,
you have to dig a little deeper, and you can uncover all kinds of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the ways that he works is by looking back both musically
and personally.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's more likely to listen to music from the past than
what's on the radio now. ``Sometimes you have to go backward to go
forward. It's better for me to listen to stuff from the '30s than
the '90s sometimes, because I see more ideas there. There's more
things that I can be inspired by. Whereas in the '90s there's a lot
of repetition of the '60s, '70s and '80s. There aren't necessarily
that many fresh ideas in rock 'n' roll, for instance.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who begin his career as a teen in the late '60s as
part of the legendary British folk band Fairport Convention, says
that he had a lot of early musical influences. His dad was a guitar
player, and so as a kid he listened to the likes of Les Paul,
Django Reinhardt and Buddy Holly. During the early days of Fairport
in swinging London, the band would reinvent itself every week in
order to get bookings _ country one week, blues the next _ and this
helped Thompson develop his unique guitar stylings.
</P>
<P>
   As for subject matter, Thompson also looks backward for
inspirations. In ``Read About Love,'' another song from ``Rumor and
Sigh,'' he explores how teens learn about the birds and the bees.
It's a comic story of a young man who knows ``what makes girls
sigh'' because he read about it in magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says the song stems from his experiences when he was
younger in a post-Victorian society.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to do serious espionage work to find out anything
about girls,'' he says. ``There was never anything really out there
in the media or newspapers, and your parents never told you
anything. So you had to find out about it from other kids, and
sometimes it was complete fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mock Tudor'' also looks at the past. Thompson calls it a look
back at London in the '60s '70s and, in some cases, the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The album is all inspired from past events, while trying to be
contemporary,'' says Thompson. ``It's not trying to be nostalgic or
evoke an era. That's just the starting point for the songs.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes the stunning ``Hope You Like the New Me,'' which he
says comes from thinking about his own stage persona and how he
borrowed bits from other people, citing Loudon Wainwright's comedic
side as an inspiration. But he also approached the subject from
another angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about people in the music business who kind of
stole things from you and were kind of unapologetic in the end,''
he says, declining to name anyone in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson isn't discouraged about not being a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to not be that commercially successful so that people
expect you to do a certain thing all the time and you feel you have
to live up to it,'' he says. ``So I'm kind of glad I've been
quasi-successful.''
</P>
<P>
   And this has helped him keep turning out artistically great
albums when other of his contemporaries are treading water, or
rehashing old stuff, or have simply packed it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of dissatisfied with everything I've ever done,
really. I don't think anything really stands up, so I'm always
looking to do it better. ... It's usually that question of, `Have I
really nailed it this time?' and the answer is usually `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Thompson says he still loves to be on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still like touring, though it's nice to be home as well.
Nice to be home with your family, says Thompson who has five
children, including a 7-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing live in front of an audience is the most rewarding
thing I do, and I love to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson expects to play L.A. again in September at a larger
venue after ``Mock Tudor's'' release.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Thompson admits it would be nice to be more
successful, but that he would be happy doing it ``if there was a
living there if there were only 50 people or 25 people in the
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mildly ambitious,'' he says. ``I don't think I'm a
megalomanic, but I'm slightly ambitious.'' &QL;

BOY HELPS TRIP UP A COUPLE OF TURKEY POACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The youngest detective in California is a
9-year-old boy who got the goods on two turkey poachers, a case
that not only led to arrests and convictions _ but a reward.
</P>
<P>
   The case started when the 9-year-old witnessed two strangers,
both men with shotguns, enter his grandparent's property. Curious,
he followed them, and then in horror, watched them shoot a wild
turkey.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly returned home, told his mother, and together they
were able to get the poacher's vehicle type and license number.
</P>
<P>
   They then called the DFG's poacher hotline, 1-888-DFG-CALTIP,
and the boy described the incident that he had witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jack Edwards of the Department of Fish and Game,
the DFG dispatcher then made contact with the nearest officer
available, a sheriff. He was able to get to the scene and nab the
poachers, still trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that in 17 years the poacher hotline has been
operating, the 9-year-old is the youngest tipster to be honored by
the program. He received a $100 cash reward, two $100 savings
bonds, a CalTIP hat and a thank-you letter from the CalTIP Board.
</P>
<P>
   The CalTIP Board, which operates independent of the DFG, accepts
donations and provides rewards for anonymous reports of wildlife
crimes and pollution incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid knew the difference between hunters and poachers,''
Edwards said. ``That's what impressed me. That's the thing that
stood out. He knew the difference between legal hunting from
illegal hunting, that what they were doing wasn't right. It's nice
to see someone 9 years old knows the difference between right and
wrong, especially when some adults have don't seem to recognize the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethical hunter obeys the law and respects landowner
property rights,'' Edwards said. ``Poachers are thieves of our
wildlife resources and they show no respect for laws or people.''
</P>
<P>
   In all cases with CalTip, callers remain anonymous so their
identities cannot be traced by anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Fear and loathing:
</P>
<P>
   At Lake Davis near Portola, the tension and concern over pike
spiraled this past week when a 3-inch pike, the size of a fish born
this spring, was caught by the DFG biologists while electro-shock
fishing. It means a spawning population of pike may exist in the
lake, bringing fear that pike may have spread over the dam and
downstream to threaten salmon, striped bass and endangered species
in the Delta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping against all odds that the three adult pike
found in May would be the end of the story,'' said DFG director Bob
Hight. ``We are investigating the possibility that pike could have
spawned in Lake Davis earlier this spring, as well as looking at
other sources from where these pike may have come.''
</P>
<P>
   The DFG is still awaiting news from the DNA lab at UCLA that
will document whether the pike were illegally planted this year, or
survived the lake's poisoning in fall of 1997. Meanwhile, the
Plumas County Fish and Game Commission added $5,000 on top of the
DFG's $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction
of any person or persons who planted illegal pike in Lake Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Lions vs. bighorns:
</P>
<P>
   The lion isn't exactly laying down with the lamb, but the
Mountain Lion Foundation, best known for winning protected status
for lions in California, has been invited by the DFG to participate
with a special committee to protect the Sierra bighorn.
</P>
<P>
   This is a landmark, with the foundation agreeing that some
predator lions may have to be taken in order to protect the
endangered bighorn, now down to about 100 head, with the recent
decline blamed mostly on kills by lions. The key, notes Executive
Director Lynn Sadler, is that stock grazing (cattle and domestic
sheep) is all too common, even in wildnerness, and should stop
within 20 miles of land designated as habitat for Sierra bighorn.
</P>
<P>
   Wolves, the latest:
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service likely will decide not to
push for the reintroduction of wolves into the Klamath-Siskiyou
region of Northern California, as has been done in parts of Idaho,
Wyoming and Montana, according to an informed source.
</P>
<P>
   To do so would apparently push the button to activate the
Endangered Species Act, which would thus become the single force
that would drive all environmental decisions in the region, which
is exactly what scientists do not want. That would disrupt current
ecosystem-wide management of the area designed to benefit dozens of
species of wildlife, fish, trees, plants and watersheds, not a
single species with a large range.

NEWEST WORD GAME: ``NAME THAT NEIGHBORHOOD!'' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 4)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When in California, you'll want to go to  &UR; SoMa &LR; . Down in
Florida, don't miss  &UR; SoBe &LR; . And in Connecticut, the place to go is
 &UR; SoNo &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   All these so-so names are a result of  &UR; stump compounding &LR; . A
 &UR; stump &LR;  is a piece of a word, the front or the back. Otto
Jespersen, the great Danish linguist, noticed in 1922 that children
tended to shorten names by using the ends: Albert became  &UR; Bert &LR; ,
Arabella just  &UR; Bella &LR;  and Elizabeth  &UR; Beth &LR; ,  &UR; Betty &LR;  or  &UR; Bess &LR; .
Adults, he found, liked to make the  &UR; stumps &LR;  out of the beginnings
of words: a gymnasium became a  &UR; gym &LR; , a kilogram a  &UR; kilo &LR; , a
photograph a  &UR; photo &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions abound, and the adults have adopted telephone's
 &UR; phone &LR;  and caravan's  &UR; van &LR; . But as language hurries up, the
pressure is on to chop big words down to their  &UR; stumps &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Geographers are leading the way.  &UR; Bosnywash &LR;  long ago triumphed
over ``Northeast Corridor,'' compounding the  &UR; stumps &LR;  of Boston and
Washington with the initials of New York. In the nation's opposite
corner is  &UR; SeaTac &LR; , a community that has grown around the airport
serving Seattle and Tacoma. (Next:  &UR; DallWorth &LR; ?)
</P>
<P>
   The boom on  &UR; stump compounding &LR;  is in neighborhood nomenclature.
The  &UR; So &LR;  is for ``south''; hence,  &UR; SoMa &LR;  is south of Market Street
in San Francisco, which old-timers looking at the cable-car tracks
called ``south of the Slot'';  &UR; SoBe &LR;  is South Beach in Miami, and
 &UR; SoNo &LR;  is South Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The grandpappy of these coinages (a play on London's Soho
neighborhood) is  &UR; SoHo &LR; , chopped down and put together in the early
'70s to describe the neighborhood south of Houston Street in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of Beitrage zur Namenforschung
(``Contributions to the Study of Personal and Place Names''),
published in Heidelberg (perhaps your copy is late in the mail),
David L. Gold, a New Yorker, explains that  &UR; stump-compounded &LR; 
neighborhood names in Gotham are ``an expression of trendiness and
gentrification.'' When the South Bronx wanted to assert itself as
an arts colony, it adopted  &UR; SoBro &LR; . In the '80s came  &UR; LoBro &LR; , for
Lower Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   A refinement of  &UR; SoHo &LR;  is  &UR; SoSoHo &LR; , which tells the visitor that
the area is both south of  &UR; SoHo &LR;  and kind of middling. Such punning
is popular: Gold points to  &UR; NoLiTa &LR; , ``a Nabokovian coinage for
North of Little Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TriBeCa &LR; , the name of the area bounded by Canal Street,
Broadway, Chambers Street and West Street, is derived from the
first syllables of the words  &UR; tri &LR; angle  &UR; be &LR; low  &UR; Ca &LR; nal. (It's more
a trapezoid than a triangle, but there's no longer a canal on
Canal; a little poetic license is allowed in  &UR; stump compounding &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   The annoyed reader will note that I am using the abomination of
capital letters in the middle of words. Don't worry about this
affectation, recorded here only to show the etymology of the
compounds. Both in common usage and in telephone directories, the
 &UR; stumpifications &LR;  are melded to  &UR; Soho &LR; ,  &UR; Tribeca &LR;  and the like.
</P>
<P>
   English is not the only language that chops and jams its words.
According to Rolf Bergmann, editor of Namenforsch (see? I just
shrank the name of his publication),  &UR; Kripo &LR;  is the  &UR; stump &LR;  of
Kriminalpolizei and  &UR; Juso &LR;  is short for Jungsozialist. The Germans
call this formation a Kurzwort, ``short word.'' The Russian
 &UR; Komsomol &LR;   &UR; stumped &LR;  Kommunisticheskii soyuz molodezhi, which means
``Communist Union of Youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Do not confuse  &UR; acronyms &LR; , which are pronounceable words made up
of a phrase's initials, with  &UR; stump compounds &LR; , which are shortened
words glued together.  &UR; NATO &LR;  is an  &UR; acronym &LR; , from the initials of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization;  &UR; KFOR &LR; , from Kosovo Force,
is an  &UR; initialized stump &LR; , pronounced KAY-for. A pure  &UR; stump
compound &LR;  is  &UR; Intelsat &LR; , from  &UR; In &LR; ternational  &UR; Tel &LR; ecommunications
 &UR; Sat &LR; ellite. Consortia and corporations like these herky-jerky
names in the language of globalese.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to break the news to residents of a Brooklyn neighborhood
where Walt Whitman sang the song of himself _ and that now styles
itself as the new Bohemia _ that their  &UR; Dumbo &LR;  does not qualify as
a  &UR; stump compound &LR; . The name formed from the initials of Down Under
the Manhattan Bridge Overpass is an  &UR; acronym &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   GRAMPS/GRANDPA/GRAMPA
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear  &UR; Grampa &LR; '' is the title of a chapter in Rabbi Steven Z.
Leder's uplifting book, ``The Extraordinary Nature of Ordinary
Things.'' The ordinary thing that gets to me is the extraordinary
disconnect between the spelling and the pronunciation of what we
call our parents' fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Most adults think they are saying  &UR; grandpa &LR;  when the sounds they
make are  &UR; granpa &LR;  without the  &UR; d &LR; . Most children, who use the word
more often, say  &UR; grampa &LR; , changing the  &UR; n &LR;  to  &UR; m &LR; , which comes more
easily before the  &UR; p &LR; . (The dental  &UR; n &LR;  conflicts with the labial
 &UR; p &LR; , as Peter Suber, a philosopher and semanticist at Earlham
College, in Indiana, has shown, and it alters to  &UR; m &LR; .  &UR; Amp &LR;  is
easy;  &UR; anp &LR;  takes much too much effort.)
</P>
<P>
   The first use I can find is attributed to Nelly Custis in 1799.
George Washington's granddaughter was reported by a visitor to
Mount Vernon to cheer up ``the General, whom she always calls
 &UR; Grampa &LR; .'' The happiest use is in a 1957 poem by Ogden Nash: ``How
confusing the beams from memory's lamp are/One day a bachelor, the
next a  &UR; grampa &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   I say it's time to spell the informal word the way it sounds:
 &UR; grampa &LR; . Got that,  &UR; gramps &LR; ? (All previous written usages are
grandfathered.)

LEFT-HANDED DNA IS NO FLUKE, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Texas)   (af)  
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a twice-told tale of the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   The first time scientists actually saw the molecule of life,
DNA, in 1979, it was not the curving helix James Watson and Francis
Crick deciphered more than 25 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Their observations, based on chemical testing, were of a
molecule, curving gracefully to the right. What the crystallization
of the molecule revealed in 1979, though, was an odd, zig-zagging,
left-turning spiral molecule. It was named left-handed DNA, or
Z-DNA, and molecular biologists dismissed it as fluke, probably
just molecular junk.
</P>
<P>
   Further research demonstrated that the right-hand version was
the usual one, and history and the biotechnology industry moved
forward.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Alexander Rich, a molecular biologist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who first saw the left-handed
DNA, never let go of it. He and others puzzled over it year after
year, wondering whether it had a role in life's chemical processes
or was just a laboratory artifact.
</P>
<P>
   Now their work has apparently paid off. Rich and his colleagues,
Thomas Schwartz, Mark Rould, Ky Lowenhaupt and Alan Herbert, have
demonstrated that Z-DNA is more than an oddity. In research
described in a recent issue of the journal Science, they found that
nature does make and use a left-handed DNA, and its role in
regulating the chemistry of life might be quite important.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard R. Sinden, an expert on DNA structure at the Texas
A&AMP;M System Health Science Center in Houston, said the report was
``exciting because it gives us a glimpse of a new way of looking at
DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   It was originally thought that DNA was just passive, a code to
be read. But now, with this and other examples being studied, it
appears that DNA is active, and can change its own written message
as it is being read. The shape of DNA, whether it is right-handed
or left-handed, helps determine how its message is read.
</P>
<P>
   The story of its behavior is intricate. In the classical
description, DNA is a book of code, and it tells cells what
substances to make to carry on daily life. There is a specialized
molecule, called RNA polymerase, that ``reads'' the DNA code as it
slides along segments of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   This reader molecule passes on the information and begins the
creation of the all-important proteins that the body can use for
purposes like building cells and burning energy.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Rich and his team say there is another possibility. In
some cases _ perhaps fewer than 10 percent, but the figure is not
known _ the reading of DNA itself changes the DNA's shape. It
relaxes the strand and permits it to flip over into the left-handed
variety.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, they say, another molecule comes into play.
This ``editor'' molecule, RNA adenosine deaminase, according to the
theory, can change DNA coding as it is being read, and it is very
attracted to the left-handed DNA.
</P>
<P>
   When the left version appears, the editor molecule jumps in,
attaches itself to the Z-DNA, and alters the message being read
out. As a result, there turns out to be more than one way to read a
DNA message, the regular and the edited version.
</P>
<P>
   In life, proteins produce by cells with edited DNA turn out to
be important. One of them is used as one of the key receptor
molecules in the brain, Rich said. Without it, animals tend to
develop epilepsy and often die. Another edited molecule is a
receptor for serotonin, the molecule whose level is increased by
antidepressants like Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   The edited version of the molecule gives a more muted response
to serotonin, and thus allows mixed, more finely-tuned, reactions
rather than only those with the unedited version.
</P>
<P>
   This also suggests that Z-DNA may be another useful control
mechanism in biotechnology. In practical terms, this means that
cells, or scientists at biotechnology firms making use of DNA, have
another tool to control what DNA does.

PERSONAL HEALTH: QUICK ACTION EASES STING OF POISON IVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can get it mowing the lawn, whacking weeds, petting the dog,
hiking through the woods, burning logs in a fireplace, gardening,
retrieving a lost ball, using the great outdoors for a toilet,
putting clothes in the washing machine or removing your shoes.
``It'' is poison ivy, a source of misery for half the people who
make contact with its allergenic sap and a potential problem for
many more people who are not yet sensitized.
</P>
<P>
   As you can see from the above list of possible exposures, poison
ivy dermatitis is not so easy to avoid. However, prevention is
possible, and when that fails, quick recognition of an incipient
outbreak and appropriate action can greatly reduce its severity and
resulting discomfort. Unfortunately, myths and misconceptions about
this perennial problem abound and all too often result in extensive
outbreaks that require medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   No one is immune. Even if you have never reacted to poison ivy,
a single intense exposure can cause a miserable rash or repeated
lesser exposures can trigger a sensitivity that will render you
susceptible to attacks for the rest of your life. So everyone would
be wise to learn more about the plant and how to avoid being
exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Poison ivy and its companions in crime, poison oak and poison
sumac, share a telling genus name, Toxicodendron, and a sap that
contains urushiol.
</P>
<P>
   Urushiol is an oil that rapidly penetrates the skin and combines
with skin proteins, triggering an allergic reaction in those
already sensitive to it and priming the pump for a future allergic
reaction in those not yet sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Urushiol is found in all parts of the plant _ leaves, stems,
roots, flowers and berries _ and is readily released when the plant
is bruised in some way, as when a hiker's leg brushes against it or
a child's ball lands on it, when it is cut down by a mower or when
it is burned in a fire. As some mango lovers have discovered,
urushiol (in lower concentrations, fortunately) is also found in
the skin of mangoes, as well as in the fleshy shell of cashews and
ginkgo nuts.
</P>
<P>
   The sap is hardy; even in the dead of winter it can cause a
reaction. It can also survive for long periods on contaminated
clothing, gardening tools and sports equipment. Items contaminated
in the fall may cause a reaction when handled the next spring. Even
dead, the plant is a problem. Poison ivy leaves or stems twined
around logs can spew urushiol into the air when burned and cause an
internal reaction when inhaled. A pet can carry the toxin on its
fur and transfer it to you or the furniture you sit on.
</P>
<P>
   Though the axiom ``leaves of three, let them be'' is well known,
poison ivy and poison oak may have five leaves and poison sumac, a
tall shrub, has seven to 13 leaflets on each stem.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the shape of these leaves and the growth habits of
the plants are highly variable, especially in different regions of
the country. The plants can be low-growing or form bushes or vines.
Poison ivy vines were once deliberately grown as foliage on English
buildings for the striking red color they turn in fall. One aid in
recognizing poison ivy and its relatives is to look for black spots
on the plant, an indication that urushiol, which is normally
yellowish, has been exposed to air, perhaps by the chomp of an
insect.
</P>
<P>
   An allergic reaction to urushiol typically becomes noticeable 24
to 36 hours after exposure, although it can begin as soon as 6
hours later, according to a report in the May 15 issue of Patient
Care, an educational magazine for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   An itchy, red, blistering rash occurs wherever urushiol has
directly touched the skin and only there. It is a myth that the
rash is contagious or that it can be spread elsewhere on the body
through the fluid in blisters.
</P>
<P>
   However, different parts of the body may break out at different
times for one of two reasons: because the skin in different places
is exposed at different times, for example, by later contact with
contaminated clothing, or because skin that is thin absorbs
urushiol faster than thicker skin.
</P>
<P>
   You would be wise to learn to recognize the various forms of
poison ivy, oak and sumac that grow where you live and play. And if
you know where they grow, you would be wise to avoid those areas if
at all possible.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot avoid walking through or working in an area where
poison ivy grows, you can reduce or prevent exposure by wearing
long sleeves and pants (although the oil can seep through cloth and
you may become exposed when you take your clothes off), wearing
heavy-duty vinyl work gloves (the oil can penetrate latex) and by
applying one of two products that act as blocking agents: Ivy Block
(sold in drug stores) and Stoko Gard (sold through industrial
suppliers).
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 144 people who reacted to urushiol at an
unprotected site, 68 percent had no reaction at a similar site that
was protected by Ivy Block, and those who did react despite
protection had a less severe reaction than at the unprotected site.
The product should be applied at least 15 minutes before possible
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   If you know or suspect you have been exposed to poison ivy, wash
the potentially contaminated skin with water as soon as possible.
If soap is available, use it. Washing thoroughly up to two hours
after exposure can help. So can the use of solvents like acetone,
alcohol or xylene applied to the skin within 30 minutes of contact
with urushiol. By removing some of the oil before it has penetrated
the skin, you can reduce the severity and extent of the reaction
and perhaps prevent it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Don't neglect to clean all contaminated tools and sports
equipment as well (best done while wearing vinyl gloves). Clothing
that may have been in contact with urushiol should be removed
carefully and placed, without touching the exposed areas, directly
in the washing machine.
</P>
<P>
   A typical mild case of poison ivy will resolve without treatment
within two weeks. However, depending on the extent and location of
the intensely itchy rash, victims may be forced to do something to
reduce the discomfort while nature takes its course.
</P>
<P>
   Treatments that can ease the suffering (there is no cure for the
condition) include applying cool compresses with Epsom salts or
some other astringent and applying calamine lotion.
</P>
<P>
   But avoid using topical products that contain antihistamines;
they can make the reaction worse by causing a sensitivity reaction.
However, over-the-counter oral antihistamines (not the nonsedating
kind available by prescription) may help a tortured victim sleep.
</P>
<P>
   More severe cases may require treatment with oral
corticosteroids like prednisone. It is crucial to take this drug
precisely according to a doctor's prescription. It is typically
given in a high dose to start and very soon afterward the dosage is
tapered off. If oral corticosteroids are prematurely discontinued,
the poison ivy reaction is likely to flare up again.
</P>
<P>
   Topical cortisone products sold over the counter are not strong
enough to quell a poison ivy attack. However, dermatology experts
writing in Patient Care said that if a poison ivy reaction was
recognized as soon as it started, a full-blown reaction might be
avoided by treating the itchy, red lesions with a potent topical
fluorinated corticosteroid, available only by prescription.
</P>
<P>
   These experts also stated that none of the herbal remedies
purported to relieve poison ivy, including plantain, feverfew and
jewelweed, offer anything more than a soothing effect.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to develop a safe and effective means of desensitizing
people to urushiol by administering tiny doses of the oil have come
up wanting. Although they have had some success in quelling
reactions, they were associated with annoying side effects. No
product now on the market is suitable for safe desensitization
injections.

   As a preschooler, Jennifer Parilla often climbed onto her
parents' bed and jumped as high as she could. ``I loved the feeling
of flying,'' recalled Ms. Parilla, of Lake Forest, Calif. Then,
when she was 5, she began lessons in the sport of trampolining.
</P>
<P>
   Now 18 and the national women's trampoline champion, Ms. Parilla
has a chance to demonstrate her sport before an enormous audience.
Last month, the International Olympic Committee announced that
trampolining would be a competitive event at the 2000 games in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Trampolining combines the high drama of diving with the fluidity
of figure skating. Jumping on a springy rectangular canvas,
bouncers, as the athletes call themselves, catapult up to 30 feet
into the air and perform precision feats.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some routines, out of 10 skills, at least 3 are triple
somersaults and the rest are doubles,'' said Ann Sims, the program
director for U.S.A. Gymnastics Trampoline and Tumbling Office.
</P>
<P>
   Lani Lokendahle of the University of Oregon in Eugene said the
sport of trampolining was created by two American originals, a
vaudeville acrobat and college gymnastics teacher named Larry
Griswold (and nicknamed ``Leapin' Larry'') and his University of
Iowa protege, George Nissen, a sometime carnival performer who
often chose to walk on his hands rather than his feet.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1930s, Nissen, inspired by the netting used under
circus acrobats, pieced together a trampoline by attaching a piece
of canvas to an iron frame with springs.
</P>
<P>
   By 1942, enough moves had been worked out to fill a trampolining
textbook produced by Griswold, who died in 1996. Later, Nissen, who
lives in San Diego, gained control of the manufacturing firm they
started. His favorite publicity shot showed him and a kangaroo as
they jumped in tandem on a trampoline.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, trampolining became an immensely popular
children's activity, both in physical education classes and at
special play centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a well-supervised situation. There were lots of
injuries, some very serious,'' said Ms. Lokendahle, who teaches
college-level trampoline classes. The injuries caused trampolining
to fall out of favor in the '60s and '70s, Ms. Lokendahle said.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans continued to train on trampolines, however, and as a
result this made-in-America sport is dominated by countries like
Russia, Belarus and France. Ms. Parilla, the lead American women's
competitor, is ranked 15th worldwide, while the top men's
trampolinist, Ryan Weston, 19, of Chubbuck, Idaho, is rated 8th.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may not even get a chance to compete at next year's
Olympics. Under the qualifying rules, 12 male and 12 female
competitors, only one each from a country, will be chosen from the
top performers at the world championship trampolining event to be
held in Sun City, South Africa, in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are totally opposed to choosing Olympians a year ahead,''
said Ms. Sims, whose organization has registered its disapproval of
the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Missing the Games would be a blow to Weston, who sold Popsicles
door to door to finance his first competition abroad at the age of
10 and who cleans his gym to pay for lessons. He recently received
$1,500 for expenses from the U.S.A. Gymnastics national committee.
``It really helped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, however, worries that the character of trampolining may
change with Olympic exposure. ``As trampolining gets bigger and
bigger,'' he said, ``I hope it doesn't acquire the ugly side of
competition.''

<P>
   Though aficionados of trampolining hope that the Olympics will
inspire children to participate in the sport, some doctors do not
share their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics, citing an estimated 83,400
trampoline-related injuries in 1996, recently reiterated its 1981
position that the equipment should not be used in homes, in routine
physical education classes or on playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies show that injuries occur when children land
incorrectly on the trampoline, hit the frame or springs, fall or
collide with another person. Nationally, about one child dies a
year from trampolining injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A study of emergency-room patients at Children's Hospital in
Columbus, Ohio, found that most injuries were sprains and strains,
followed by fractures. Some 96 percent of the accidents happen with
home equipment, according to the study's lead author, Dr. Gary A.
Smith, an emergency medicine specialist at Ohio State University
College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Parental supervision makes little difference; 73 percent of the
injuries involving young children happen when a parent is present.
``Time and time again in the emergency room, I hear parents say, `I
was right there and I couldn't do anything,''' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Sands, an exercise physiologist at the University of
Utah, argued that sales of home trampolines have increased at a
much higher rate than injuries _ 260 percent in sales between 1990
and 1997 compared with 154 percent in injuries. He said the
accident rate on trampolines was below that of other popular
equipment, including bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any physical activity carries risks,'' he said. ``I get the
feeling that we're supposed to be walking around in a big padded
suit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith insisted, ``This is an epidemic by any definition.
Diverting attention to another public health problem doesn't
diminish the importance of the one at hand.'' He said children
could benefit from trampolining as long as it was taught with
proper supervision at a gymnastics school. ``It helps develop
balance and coordination skills,'' Smith said.

   Flocks and Schools
</P>
<P>
   Q. When a school of fish or a flock of birds all seem to turn at
the same moment, how do they manage to do that?
</P>
<P>
   A. Scientists studying the complex behavior of schools of fish
or flocks of birds, which they term schooling or flocking, once
assumed that it had to do with signals from a leader who was
somehow able to coordinate the movements of the group, and to do so
instantaneously.
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of computers, many researchers have come to
suspect that this extremely close synchronization is more like the
``wave'' of people standing up and sitting down that is frequently
seen moving across a sports stadium. In such patterns, each member
of a crowd acts individually based on a fairly simple set of rules
for behavior, with the outcome being mass synchronization.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments with flocks and schools often examine how the groups
react to a stimulus that resembles a predator. Though the overall
motion of the group is easy to see, it takes computers to keep
track of individual movement decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers do not know all the rules that govern the
decisions, but they do know that birds and fish must try to keep
some minimal distance away from their neighbors and that stragglers
on the outskirts of a flock are at risk. The first individuals may
move slowly, with the rest picking up speed as the ``wave'' travels
through the flock.

   Ancient Chirp of Crickets
</P>
<P>
   Fossils can give a good idea of what the natural world might
have looked like millions of years ago, but because organs of
communication are so rarely preserved, not much is known about how
it might have sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a study of 55-million-year-old fossils found in Denmark has
revealed one sound from the ancient world: the chirp of crickets.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the University of Goettingen in Germany,
examining fossilized forewings of a large (five-inch wingspan)
cricket, show that it had the same sound-producing structures as
modern varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Male crickets are the insect world's strolling violinists,
bowing their wings together and creating chirps as teeth-like
surfaces on the left wing scratch across a raised vein on the
right. The right wing also has a complex of spines, and a membrane
(larger than a similar membrane on the left) that helps the sound
radiate.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, writing in the journal Nature, saw these same
structures on the fossilized crickets and reported that the insects
probably produced a song with a frequency peak of about 7,000
hertz, or cycles per second, similar to the chirps of living
species.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also saw signs of how crickets have evolved. In
the fossilized crickets, both wings had spine complexes, and the
difference in membrane size between the two wings was less
pronounced. The researchers suggest that crickets evolved from a
bilaterally symmetrical ancestor, becoming asymmetric over time as
courtship behavior evolved (the chirps being essentially love
songs). The asymmetry started to show itself in the fossilized
species and has progressed much further in modern crickets.
</P>
<P>
   Collision Course in Space
</P>
<P>
   As high-tech communications gadgets proliferate on Earth, the
satellites enabling them to work proliferate above. Increasingly,
communication systems call for whole constellations of satellites,
orbiting at about the same altitude, to provide global coverage.
One constellation, the Iridium system, with 66 spacecraft, is now
in place, and more are planned.
</P>
<P>
   All those satellites, however, have to share near-Earth space
with lots of junk _ 10,000 pieces of debris four to eight inches
across or larger; 100,000 pieces bigger than about half an inch.
Because all that debris is traveling at thousands of miles an hour,
the possibility of a collision severe enough to destroy a satellite
is a real one.
</P>
<P>
   Just how real has been revealed by Italian scientists, who
analyzed the risk for a constellation of satellites like Iridiums.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in Nature, they concluded that there was a 10 percent
chance per decade that a satellite in a typical constellation would
have a catastrophic collision. That is bad enough. But worse is
what could happen next.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the nature of the orbits in a satellite
constellation, the debris from one collision (which itself could
create thousands more pieces of junk) would increase the chances of
another collision with a satellite in the constellation, to 10
percent over five years. The eventual result could be a chain of
collisions that may irreversibly pollute a portion of near-Earth
space much faster than previously thought, perhaps over a century,
rather than 300 to 500 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bees Arrive by Sea
</P>
<P>
   The first colonies of Africanized honey bees _ the so-called
killer bees, though ``killer'' is something of a misnomer _ have
been found east of the Mississippi River, and they have come not by
land, but by sea.
</P>
<P>
   Florida agriculture officials discovered the colonies at the
port of Jacksonville. DNA testing showed that the bees were of the
Africanized variety and that the queens had mated with drones from
other colonies. Previously, colonies had been found on ships at the
port, but these were the first to hop to land. It is unclear
whether they may spread.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive bees first came to the United States in 1990,
into Texas from Mexico. But their eastward spread has halted around
Houston.

ESSAY: IS THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING CHIP NEARING THE END OF THE
LINE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Bonsai trees, dolls, toy soldiers, models, bracelet charms,
chihuahuas, funerary amulets: their attraction is in their size.
The brain seems to be wired to love miniature things.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Egyptian tombs were stocked with diminutive models
depicting life as it was many thousands of years ago, and model
makers are still perfecting their art. One of their most
spectacular achievements came three years ago when an affiliate of
the Toyota company built a working model car the size of a grain of
rice. It cost more than a real car and had no practical use, but it
delighted its beholders.
</P>
<P>
   The perpetual appeal of Lilliputian objects is based on more
than pleasure alone, however; miniaturization has become a vital
attribute of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Gears, motors, bearings and pumps with dimensions comparable to
the thickness of a hair have become available for implantation into
human organs.
</P>
<P>
   DNA molecules have been adapted to convey coded messages.
Chemists have synthesized molecules with all kinds of useful shapes
and functions: propellers, cages and ratchets, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Military laboratories are developing mechanical insects for use
as spies _ flies on the wall, so to speak _ and last week a
coalition of Japanese companies claimed to have built a robot ant
capable of crawling through thin pipes and fixing things.
</P>
<P>
   A whole new category of midget gadgetry called
``nanotechnology'' has come to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   No field of human endeavor is more dependent on nanotechnology
than computers, because the speed and power of a computer is
largely a function of its designers' ability to jam as many
microscopic components as possible into a chip. Refinements in
photolithography, molecular-beam epitaxy and other technologies
have reduced chip components to almost incredibly small sizes.
</P>
<P>
   It has been tempting to believe that quantum leaps in
miniaturization and the consequent improvement of computers will go
on forever. But this may not be so.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing goes so much against the grain as being told that one
has reached the end of the line: that the road ahead is washed out,
or that the stars are forever beyond reach, or that no one will
ever live to 200.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether we like it or not, nature imposes some real
limits that can never be breached, however resolutely we grit our
teeth and try and try again.
</P>
<P>
   There's the problem of space travel faster than the speed of
light (a favorite dream of science fiction), for instance, or the
hope of building a perpetual-motion machine that forever produces
more energy than it consumes.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long known these to be vain hopes, but an
assumption many have made is that technology can go on reducing the
size of things indefinitely. The art of making things ever smaller
had progressed so far by 1966 that viewers of the movie ``Fantastic
Voyage'' could suspend disbelief. (That's the one in which Raquel
Welch and her colleagues are reduced to the size of microbes to
carry out some tricky surgery in the body of their patient.)
</P>
<P>
   Fantastic Voyage was fiction, but since then something called
the ``lab on a chip'' has appeared: a class of chips containing
microscopic pumps, conduits and reaction chambers that swiftly
carry out many kinds of chemical analysis and synthesis using
amounts of chemical reagents too small for the naked eye to see.
These tiny laboratories can even work inside a person to treat
illness.
</P>
<P>
   But despite such astonishing progress in miniaturization, brick
walls persist in blocking the way. A troubling new one turned up
last week in a report published in the journal Nature by Dr. David
Anthony Muller and his colleagues at Lucent Technologies, Murray
Hill, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Gordon Moore, a cofounder of the Intel Corporation,
predicted that the number of components that could be packed into a
computer chip would increase four-fold every three years.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that prediction, known as Moore's Law, has proved fairly
accurate, and each year's advances have made last year's computers
seem out of date.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lucent team showed last week that at the present pace of
chip improvement, technologists will hit a barrier in the year
2012, beyond which further progress with silicon-based chips may
not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is simply stated. In computer chips, various
conducting or semiconducting components must be separated from one
another by thin insulating layers of silicon dioxide.
Miniaturization of the microscopic components of a silicon chip has
reached the point at which more than a hundred million components
can be packed into a single large memory chip, and that means that
everything, including the silicon dioxide insulation, has to be
very, very small.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing can be made ``arbitrarily'' small, to use a word
favored by scientists. The Lucent group discovered by experiment
that the insulating silicon dioxide layers in a chip can block a
flow of current only if they are thicker than about five silicon
atoms deep; if less than this, current leaks through the insulating
layer and the chip is rendered useless.
</P>
<P>
   The present thickness of the best silicon dioxide insulators in
chips is equivalent to about 25 silicon atoms. If progress in
miniaturization continues at its present rate, chip makers will
reach the five-atom minimum thickness in the year 2012, the Lucent
group predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Will that be the end of the line?
</P>
<P>
   ``So far,'' wrote Dr. Max Schulz of the University of
Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany, ``there has seemed to be no obstacle
to stop the continuous development of microelectronic chips. The
new limit to oxide thickness is fundamental, however, and cannot
simply be overcome by technological improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   This won't mean a dead end to improvements in the arts of
miniaturizing, of course. The great physicist Richard Feynman
pointed out in 1959 that a lathe could be used to make a smaller
lathe which in turn could make one smaller still, in a progression
without any obvious limit.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Feynman, like other scientists, recognized that there
are always absolute limits somewhere down the line, and the farther
a technology advances, the closer it gets to some roadblock erected
by Nature herself.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the techniques of making things ever smaller will continue
to improve, but maybe, in the words of Dr. David E.H. Jones of the
University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, the claims made for the
possibilities of nanotechnology ``will remain just another exhibit
in the freak show that is the boundless-optimism school of
technical forecasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell.

SECRET OF ABALONE'S REMARKABLE STRENGTH IS FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world is awash in space-age materials, from the graphite
panels of an airplane wing to the honeycomb sandwich of a
skateboard. To the list can be added the shell of an abalone, that
rock-dwelling creature, about the size of a steam iron, that lives
in shallow waters off the West Coast and elsewhere in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Abalone shell is prized for the iridescent beauty of its
mother-of-pearl interior. But scientists admire it for something
else: its toughness. The shell is composed almost entirely of
calcium carbonate, yet it is 3,000 times more fracture resistant
than a crystal of the pure mineral alone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, scientists at the University of California at Santa Barbara
have uncovered the secret to abalone's remarkable strength, and the
findings may help in the development of a new class of strong,
lightweight materials.
</P>
<P>
   Mother of pearl, or nacre, is a composite material, one that any
chemical engineer would be proud to have invented. Electron
microscopy has revealed its structure: tiny tablets of calcium
carbonate held together in a protein matrix, like bricks in mortar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We first thought that the key to its strength was how the
tablets were stacked,'' said Dr. Bettye L. Smith, the lead author
of a paper describing the abalone research in the current issue of
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   But a brick wall will crumble when hit by a sledgehammer. The
researchers realized that there must be something about the
proteins in abalone that act like an adhesive, keeping the tablets
together even when subject to strong forces.
</P>
<P>
   For their investigations, the researchers had the ideal tool: an
atomic force microscope, which can measure the force required to
break bonds. AFMs, as they are known, are relatively new, and Santa
Barbara has a leading AFM expert, Paul K. Hansma, on its faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Using an atomic force microscope is something like pulling
taffy, but on a molecular level. A tiny cantilever tip is stuck to
the material and pulls on it, measuring the minuscule forces
exerted as the material stretches and eventually breaks.
</P>
<P>
   With other materials, force steadily increases until a
catastrophic break occurs. But the abalone proteins broke in fits
and starts, with force building up and then releasing, building up
again and releasing again, continuing until finally a permanent
break occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers realized that the proteins have what they call
``sacrificial'' bonds that break before the entire molecule does.
Dr. Smith compared it to a sticky string that has been clumped
together in various spots along its length. ``When you pull on the
string, the first thing that happens is one of those knots is going
to break,'' she said. ``But you haven't broken the backbone _ you
can keep pulling and pulling on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Large amounts of energy can be dissipated with this arrangement,
so that it takes cumulatively more force to fracture the shell. The
abalone proteins have a further advantage in that these sacrificial
bonds can re-form after they are broken.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are now investigating ways to create similar
materials in the laboratory, ones that might eventually have
commercial applications.
</P>
<P>
   Such new materials might also be easier to manufacture. While
many composite materials require high temperature or pressure or
both in the manufacturing process, abalone makes its shell while
sitting on a rock, getting the calcium carbonate from sea water and
secreting the protein adhesive. For all the space-age qualities of
the material, the process is decidedly down to earth.

WHEN THE TRUTH IS AS ELUSIVE AS THE CURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By SANDEEP JAUHAR, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One afternoon recently when I was working in my outpatient
clinic, a middle-aged woman came to me with a surprise. The severe
lower back pain and leg pain and numbness that had plagued her for
months, making it impossible for her even to sit in a chair on
recent clinic visits, had all but disappeared. She informed me that
she had canceled her back surgery scheduled for later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   But all was not well. Her neck and shoulder, only mildly
bothersome on recent visits, now ached as if in a vise. Her left
arm was almost entirely numb, except for shooting pains when she
flexed her neck. Though an MRI last month had been normal, I was
certain this unfortunate woman had pinched a nerve in her neck,
probably from a herniated disc.
</P>
<P>
   I asked her to close her eyes and gently stroked her left arm.
She felt nothing. I stroked a little harder. Still nothing. The
sensation in her right arm was normal, but her left arm, even when
I scratched it with my nails, was completely numb.
</P>
<P>
   But this did not make sense. Though her sensory deficit was
profound, she had walked in clutching her handbag. And her muscle
strength was normal and equal in both arms. When I noticed her
closed eyelids fluttered gently whenever I touched her left arm, I
could only draw one conclusion: my patient was lying to me.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this kind of thing is common.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is obvious, as when a patient with a back injury
cannot go to work but can keep up with his bowling league. Other
times the deception is so complete that the lying patient can
outfox even the most astute clinician.
</P>
<P>
   Deception assumes many different guises. One is what the
diagnostic bible of psychiatry calls malingering: ``the intentional
production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychiatric
symptoms'' motivated by the desire to avoid work, evade
prosecution, obtain drugs and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Another, spurred by the need to play the role of a sick person,
is termed factitious disorder. When patients lie to themselves,
convincing themselves that they are sick when they are not, the
condition is called somatization disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Deception by patients is rarely straightforward or simple.
Patients may omit details, deliberately or not, or they may
fabricate them. They may feign symptoms that do not exist
(simulation), or intentionally hide symptoms that do
(dissimulation). They may even tamper with data or laboratory
substances.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Dr. John Meyer, a forensic psychiatrist at New York
Presbyterian Hospital, spoke to residents at my hospital about
malingering. Patients lie sometimes, he said, and doctors, because
of fear of confrontation, desire to give patients the benefit of
the doubt and a busy schedule, often don't pick up on it.
</P>
<P>
   Some months ago I took care of a young woman, a doctor's wife,
who for months had been unable to walk because of severe dizziness.
Her symptoms started one afternoon when she got up from a chair in
her garden, felt dizzy and fell down. Since that episode, she had
become dizzy every time she walked and had been almost house bound.
</P>
<P>
   Many hospital visits and an extensive neurologic and cardiac
work-up, costing more than $100,000, had revealed nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I did not know what ailed this unfortunate woman, but I did
notice that her husband paid very little attention to her. He was
busy building up his practice, she said, and took off from work to
spend time with her only when she was in the hospital. She
certainly seemed to have ample incentive to be sick.
</P>
<P>
   One morning I walked into her room and suggested she speak with
a psychiatrist. To my surprise, she readily agreed. ``I want to
talk about my problems,'' she said. By late morning, she was
walking unassisted down the hall, with no dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Malingering patients signal their deception in a variety of
ways. They may give hesitant answers or make vague or irrelevant
statements. They may express exaggerated confidence in their
doctor's ability. They may feel compelled to perform suspiciously
poorly on testing.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists say the most valuable tools for detecting
deception are being aware that one may be lied to, asking
open-ended questions and prolonging the medical interview. But
doctors must also know their medicine _ for example, that deficits
like inability to feel pain or judge temperature often occur
together because these sensations are carried by the same nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Very little guidance is provided to doctors for handling
malingering patients. Some advocate confronting patients. Others
say confrontation can alienate patients and instead prefer a more
sympathetic approach, treating the deception as a symptom.
</P>
<P>
   But in their efforts to detect malingering, doctors can fall
prey to their own skepticism. Recently, I took care of a young
woman who had frequently been admitted to the hospital for asthma
though her lung function tests showed she had only a mild case.
</P>
<P>
   She was a single mother with several children, and some doctors
and nurses on the ward wondered whether she was faking her disease
to avoid taking care of her children.
</P>
<P>
   One morning on rounds, our team noted that she was wheezing and
appeared to be in moderate distress. However, she was not tensing
her neck muscles while she breathed, a common sign of respiratory
trouble, and was speaking in full sentences without becoming
winded. The oxygen level in her blood was normal.
</P>
<P>
   After rounds our team had a long discussion. Most of them
thought she was faking and wasting our time. Even my resident, a
kind, soft-spoken man, was incensed at this affront and suggested
discharging her from the hospital immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about her wheezing?'' I asked a senior member of the
team. ``Patients fake wheezing all the time,'' he replied. ``Next
time you see her, ask her to hum while she breathes. No one can
fake a wheeze when they're humming. Come on, let's go ask her to
hum.''
</P>
<P>
   I was busy and decided to give her the benefit of the doubt.

IF SHOPPING IS OUR ECONOMY, WE SHOULD GET BETTER SALESPEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Shopping, the All-American pasttime, lies at the
heart of consumerism. Furthermore, the United States economy, off
on a record tear, is powered by consumer spending more than any
other factor, putting in the shade such financial stalwarts as
manufacturing and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Consumerism seems a chancy reed to lean on for the continuation
of such fabulous national well-being for so long a time. After all,
it is subject to vagaries, such as the psychic mood of the people
who are doing the buying. It's not like relying on a powerful
industrial base, for example, with its comparative stolidity.
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason, then, to buttress the arts of retail, the
selling of goods, in which spirit these observations are offered.
</P>
<P>
   If, as planned, this column were written several weeks ago, it
would have quickly concluded that consumerism is facing
insurmountable difficulties, which would mean that our economy was
in imminent danger of loosing steam.
</P>
<P>
   This gloomy assessment stemmed from personal experiences,
dealing with sales people in the wide spectrum of stores and
businesses to which foot soldiers of consumerism expose themselves
every day, including Sundays, as they venture on their mission to
keep this country's prosperity on its upward track.
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely in the course of doing my civic duty by
relentless shopping, that I began to notice that in transaction
upon transaction, whether in independently owned stores or in
outlets of national chains, whether the establishments were
franchises or boutiques, shopping was depressingly similar.
</P>
<P>
   The affair was terribly one-sided. The buyer enters, unheralded,
selects the merchandise without help or guidance, brings it to the
cashier, turns over cash money, check or credit card, and is
greeted at best by indifference. More likely, there is sullenness,
occasionally hostility, as if the process of paying for goods
interfered with more pressing concerns for the so-called
salesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Not a word of friendliness, certainly no thanks, are uttered as
American money is turned over to the person whose own financial
security depends upon the frequency of these dealings.
</P>
<P>
   It was unsettling and worse. Let's not shirk its true
significance, this was unpatriotic.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there were rare encounters with obliging
salespeople, who knew their stock, provided help when it was
needed, and did it all with courtesy and pleasantness, only served
to highlight how miserable in comparison were the more numerous
encounters of the other kind.
</P>
<P>
   It was a depressing state of affairs, in which our national
decline and fall on the brink of the new millenium was writ clearly
and large. If shopping were to continue to be so frightfully
unpleasant, it would surely lead to a diminution with all the
resultant risks of stalling growth. Just as I was sitting down at
the computer to expose the threat to the common welfare my shopping
experiences began to change.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of meeting clods behind the counter or sales station,
bit by bit the ratio of exemplary employees increased. This, of
course, impaired the premise of the column, so I had to wait and
see, lest I commit a journalist indiscretion I would come to
regret.
</P>
<P>
   So rather than focusing on the declining state of shopping, with
its profound implications, I sounded off on secondary issues such
as war in the Balkans, presidential politics and life in the cyber
age.
</P>
<P>
   Reserving judgment turned out to be the right thing to do. My
earlier experiences shopping were like my lottery games: I had run
into a sustained and unrelieved streak of very bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the poor experiences have been eclipsed by the many more
pleasant ones. These have lightened the mood, and I now longer
despair about the nation's future.
</P>
<P>
   However, there remains substantial concern, if not a crisis.
Averaging out the two halves of my shopping episodes, it is clear
that while there are many fine, accomplished salespersons to be
found, their opposites are in place in roughly equal number.
</P>
<P>
   So there is much yet to be done by owners and supervisors to
inculcate the proper attitudes in many of the help, who apparently
were raised by wolves in the wilderness, and were never schooled,
and thus don't know the relevance of the expressions ``May I help
you?'', ``Thank You'' and ``You are welcome'' in human intercourse.

EDIE FALCO FINDS OVERNIGHT SUCCESS AFTER DECADE OF WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Edie Falco's career finally took off when she
quit a job she had, and didn't get a job she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few short years ago, Falco was living in New York City
(as she still does, in the West Village), doing some B movies and
guest roles on shows like ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' and
``Law &AMP; Order.''
</P>
<P>
   She was also waitressing. As she said, ``I had to have some kind
of job or another to pay the rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, two things happened. After making the film ``Cost of
Living'' (released in 1997), she quit working tables. Falco was
going to stretch the money from the film as far as it would go, and
just act, ``jumping off without a net.''
</P>
<P>
   Around this time she also appeared in a television pilot based
on the movie ``Fargo.'' It didn't go anywhere. Falco still needed a
job.
</P>
<P>
   Then she got one. And another one. And another.
</P>
<P>
   After years of being told she didn't have the right hair, or
face, or voice, or whatever, Falco is now riding a wave most actors
can only dream about. She is a star on Broadway in ``Side Man''
(she plays Terry), the Tony Award winner for best play. She also
plays Diane Wittlesey, a female correction officer on the gritty
prison drama ``Oz'' (the third season premieres Wednesday, July 14,
at 10 p.m. on HBO).
</P>
<P>
   Then Falco took on another project, also for HBO, playing the
wife of a New Jersey mobster. It was so different the cast didn't
know if the show would last. It stuck, and ``The Sopranos'' became
the most talked about show of the season after its debut in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oz'' and ``The Sopranos'' are the two best examples of the
programming HBO has done in recent years, transforming the cable
network from just a home of movies we see over (and over, and over
...) to an outlet for some of the best first-run shows on
television.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of all this is Falco, whose schedule often means
she is shooting a television episode during the day and performing
live in the play at night. ``The Sopranos,'' with new episodes
starting up in January, soon begins production on the next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pretty tired,'' Falco conceded in a recent telephone
interview from New York City, when she took some time out from a
magazine photo shoot. ``You go for so many years without any work
... I am just so grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Falco, 35, is especially grateful since she and other cast
members were not that sure the story of a mob guy, his family, his
Family and a shrink would resonate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that the scripts were great,'' she said. ``But I know
better than to get too attached to these things. I didn't think we
would be picked up. None of us thought anyone was going to get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So why did America get it? ``I do not know,'' she said. ``I have
no perspective if it is something I'm in. I hope we can keep it
going.''
</P>
<P>
   (This is as good a spot as any to remind readers I was in the
same huge graduating class as Falco at Northport High School.
Thankfully, she didn't remember me.)
</P>
<P>
   So, does Falco ever confuse Terry with Carmela Soprano, or
Carmela with Diane, or any of them with Edie? Nah.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to `Oz' ... I don't wonder if I'm Terry,'' she said.
``It is very clear. I couldn't ask for three more different and
fulfilling parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Falco what she will be doing a decade from now and she
answers she has no clue. What she does know is she has no plans to
slow down now; she is just on too hot a streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to think my whole life could be filled with
projects I cared as much about,'' she said. ``I have the energy now
I may not have in five years or 10 years. I might as well take
advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about it. She is, she is.

TEAM DETECTS NEUTRINO FIRED THROUGH EARCH'S CRUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team of Japanese, American and Korean scientists announced
Monday that they had for the first time fired a neutrino particle
through a 155-mile slice of the earth's crust and recorded its
arrival at the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement marked the opening of an experiment expected to
last several years seeking evidence that neutrino particles in
flight oscillate from one form to another. Three types of neutrinos
are known to exist: muon neutrinos, electron neutrinos and tau
neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, Japanese and American scientists announced the
discovery of very strong evidence for oscillation between neutrino
types, or ``flavors,'' but the experiment begun this month could
independently buttress the case for oscillation even more strongly.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrinos, which have no electric charge, were long thought to
have no mass. But if, as now believed, they oscillate from one
flavor to another, the rules of quantum mechanics dictate that they
must have at least a little mass.
</P>
<P>
   Since neutrinos are ubiquitous throughout the universe, their
collective mass could have important consequences for cosmological
processes like the formation of galactic clusters.
</P>
<P>
   The latest experiment was done in Japan by KEK (a Japanese
acronym for High Energy Research Organization) near Tokyo and the
Super Kamiokande neutrino detector 155 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   On June 19 at 6:42 p.m., Japanese time, a big proton accelerator
at KEK fired a blast of muon neutrinos at a grazing angle into the
ground along a straight line leading to both a nearby neutrino
detector and the Super Kamiokande detector 155 miles away. Of the
trillions of neutrinos in the volley, the detector at the end of
the line recorded just one, a result consistent with a prediction
that about one artificially created neutrino would leave its trace
in the water filling the Kamiokande detector each day.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the experiment (called ``K2K,'' for ``KEK to
Kamiokande'') is fairly simple: to compare the flow of
accelerator-launched neutrinos hitting the near detector with that
of the neutrinos covering the 155 miles through the earth to Super
Kamiokande.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their ghostly nature, most neutrinos easily pass
unhindered through the entire earth, and only in the rarest case
does a neutrino hit something and leave its mark. The flux of
neutrinos reaching the near and far detectors should therefore be
about the same, unless neutrinos oscillate.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Super Kamiokande detector can register only muon
neutrinos, if many muon neutrinos from the accelerator change
flavor as they travel 155 miles, their new forms would not be
detected, and Super Kamiokande should see a net deficit, compared
with the muon neutrinos seen by the near detector.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the experiment has been running for only several
weeks, far too short a time to collect convincing data, several
scientists, who requested anonymity, said there was already a hint
of oscillation in the numbers. They said the evidence was mounting
that the oscillation was probably transforming muon neutrinos into
taus, which cannot be detected directly by the Kamiokande detector.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence, they said, that the participation of a
hypothetical sterile neutrino in oscillations can almost be ruled
out.

   &UR; PRO &AMP; CON: Physical Fitness As a Job Yardstick &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. Are physical performance standards discriminatory when used
as criteria in hiring? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By ALISHA BERGER &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Valid physical fitness tests for employment in demanding jobs do
not discriminate because they measure an applicant's ability to do
the work. Test validation involves defining the job's critical
physical tasks, and the physiological demands of the job. The
testing goal is to identify a applicants with fitness congruent
with demands. If a job involves lifting a 75-pound box, a valid
test defines the strength a worker needs to lift the box. If a weak
worker cannot lift 75 pounds, a stronger worker should be given the
task.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that work-related injuries, especially back
injuries, increase when workers are not matched to the physical job
demands. Also, hiring fit workers is a sound business. It leads to
lower worker compensation and health care costs and increased
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   -DR. ANDREW S. JACKSON, professor of health and human
performance, University of Houston
</P>
<P>
   Pre-employment physical fitness tests are discriminatory. More
than 100 physiological differences have been found between men and
women, making it virtually impossible to construct a test that is
fair to box sexes or that yields results that can meaningfully be
applied to the work site.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively larger size and substantially higher levels of
lean body mass of the average man enable him to be stronger, faster
and more powerful than women. But women have better balance, manual
dexterity, flexibility and coordination. Obviously, depending on
what test items are selected, a specific assessment battery can be
skewed toward one sex or the other. But it is hard to imagine a
test that would not be weighted to favor muscular fitness-related
measurements.

Calif.

<P>
   &UR; Marinades and Cancer &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Cooks know that marinating a steak before grilling improves
flavor and tenderizes. Now, scientists suggest the technique
decreases the production of carcinogenic compounds in meats and
fish cooked at high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't know what magic bullet in the marinade reduces
it,'' said Mark G. Knize, a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
scientist, who tested recipes and products to find the effects of
marinade on meat. He and his colleagues stumbled onto it as a small
part of a a study financed by the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   They found that marinating chicken even less than an hour before
grilling substantially decreased the production of heterocyclic
amines, cancer-causing agents that develop as fat from grilled meat
drips on hot coals and then wafts upward. The amines have been
linked in laboratory tests on rodents and monkeys to breast and
colon cancers.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Hawaii Cancer Research Center, Dr. Pratibha
V. Nerurkar and her colleagues have taken the research further.
Reporting in a coming issue of Nutrition and Cancer, their team
tested Hawaiian teriyaki and an Indian turmeric-garlic marinades on
beef and found that both slowed production of carcinogenic agents.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nerurkar, a biochemist, said she suspected the liquid
content of the marinade added moisture and prevented the meat from
burning too much.
</P>
<P>
   The American Institute for Cancer Research in Washington
described the reports as encouraging. ``What a great thing to do if
we can significantly reduce the amount of carcinogens formed on
meat and fish on the grill and also make foods taste better,'' said
Melanie Polk, the director of nutrition education at the institute.

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the deliberations in full swing for revisions of the
federal Dietary Guidelines for All Americans, to be reissued next
year, what started as a controversy is fast progressing into a
contentious argument: should the government be recommending dairy
products as part of a balanced diet, given that once most nonwhite
people leave childhood, they cannot easily digest those products?
</P>
<P>
   Led by groups like the Congressional Black Caucus, a growing
chorus of health and civil rights organizations are saying no, and
calling for reworked guidelines that reflect the nation's digestive
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the caucus wrote to President Clinton arguing that
the current guidelines ``demonstrate a consistent racial bias.'' It
said the revised guidelines should list dairy products as
``optional and in no way superior'' to other dietary sources of
calcium, which is vital to bone strength.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's dairy industry is resisting, as is the
Department of Agriculture, whose dual mandate is to advise
consumers about good eating while promoting American farm products.
As instructed by Congress, the Agriculture Department updates the
guidelines every five years, and uses them as the basis for the
Eating Right Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are called Guidelines for Americans, so they should
reflect all Americans,'' said Donna M. Christian-Christensen, a
Democrat who is the Virgin Islands delegate to Congress. She heads
the Congressional Black Caucus' Health Brain Trust and is a family
physician.
</P>
<P>
   All children are born with the intestinal enzyme lactase, which
is necessary for digesting milk. Beginning at age 5, however, many
people whose genetic background is not Northern European begin to
produce less lactase and lose their ability to digest milk by age
10. Without it, dairy products travel through the stomach
undigested and then ferment in the small bowel, a process that can
cause discomforting symptoms like gas, cramps and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, 25 percent of Americans have trouble digesting
milk, estimates Dr. Walter C. Willett, chairman of the department
of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. Among
Asian-Americans, 95 percent are naturally lactose intolerant, said
Dr. Richard Grand, a professor of pediatrics at Tufts University
Medical School who has published studies on genetic variables for
lactose intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Some 65 percent of African-Americans and American Indians are
lactose intolerant as are half of all Hispanic Americans, he said.
Among Caucasians the figure is 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because dairy products are a rich source of calcium, the
government has recommended that everyone consume them. Eight ounces
of milk contains 300 milligrams of calcium; the recommended daily
allowance for most adults 20 to 50 is 1,000 milligrams a day.
``Calcium deficiency is a much more important problem than lactose
intolerance,'' Grand said.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy products are not the only good source of calcium. Others
include dark, leafy green vegetables, like kale and collard greens.
But nutrition experts say that Americans are unlikely to embrace
them. That is one reason why the guidelines have not emphasized
them, said Shirley Watkins, the Agriculture Department's under
secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she said, even people who are lactose intolerant (as
she is) can often consume small amounts of milk. ``It's not
life-threatening,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines issued in 1995 call for two to three servings of
milk, yogurt or cheese daily. Among other things, the guidelines
are used for determining menus by a number of federal food
assistance programs, which reach a disproportionately high
percentage of minority group members. Public school lunch programs
are required to provide milk to all students, based on the
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins said a lactose-intolerant student must provide a
doctor's note if he or she wants a lactose-free alternative. Ms.
Watkins added, however, that public schools were not required to
provide the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an
organization in Washington that promotes vegetarianism, also aims
to play down milk on the food pyramid. The organization has
received letters of support from Dr. Joycelyn Elders, the former
surgeon general; the former boxer Muhammad Ali; the writer Alice
Walker; Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr.; the NAACP; the Association of
Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations; the National Black
Nurses Association, and the National Hispanic Medical Association,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an ongoing campaign to get every adult to drink three
glasses of milk a day,'' said Willett of Harvard, agreeing with the
groups' efforts to de-emphasize milk. ``That's obviously about
increasing sales and profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Agriculture Department advisory committee, who
are university faculty members serving without pay, say this just
is not so. ``The guidelines process is subject to a lot of pressure
from a lot of groups,'' said Dr. Shiriki Kumanyika, a nutrition
professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and
an advisory committee member. ``I like to do policy work and I like
to do it without being pressured on either side. And I don't think
the milk issue has been singled out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, milk industry representatives have denounced the
physicians' group and Willett for engaging in what they call
``scare tactics that try and move people to their vegan agenda,''
said Dr. Greg Miller, vice president for nutrition research at the
National Dairy Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they're using the racial card in a very
irresponsible way to suggest that dairy products are not
appropriate,'' said Susan Ruland, a spokeswoman for the National
Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board. ``In fact, there's a calcium
crisis in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ruland, whose group is behind the $160 million ``Got Milk?''
and ``Milk Mustache'' advertising campaigns, called the concerns
irresponsible. (She also called Willett a ``vegetarian,'' a
description he laughingly dismissed as ``dietary slander.'')
</P>
<P>
   The committee working on the guidelines has been meeting since
September and has at least one more meeting scheduled before
writing its consensus report, which will then go to the departments
of Health and Human Services and Agriculture for review. The final
version will be published next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one committee member, Dr. Richard R. Deckelbaum,
director of the Institute of Human Nutrition at Columbia
University, hinted that milk opponents might be protesting
prematurely. ``The needs of different populations have been one of
the areas of priority for this committee,'' he said.

YOUNG PEOPLE SAY YES TO HIV TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By ALISA TANG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jennifer Jako once had a ``not me'' attitude about AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really was an unlikely candidate for this disease,'' Ms.
Jako, an AIDS educator and documentary film producer, said during a
panel discussion in New York last week. ``I didn't think this would
happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jako, who is from Lake Oswego, a suburb of Portland, Ore.,
tested positive for HIV eight years ago, when she was 18.
</P>
<P>
   Her youth was typical of many people testing positive: 51
percent of new HIV infections in the United States are among people
under 25, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Yet, the agency says, only a quarter of sexually active
teen-agers have been tested.
</P>
<P>
   The panel discussion was held to announce a study by the Henry
J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which explored the attitudes toward
HIV testing among 73 higher-risk teen-agers, defined as sexually
active and economically or socially marginalized youth in urban
areas that have a high incidence of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, the study found, young people believed that
HIV could not affect them. But most of the teen-agers said that,
given the opportunity, they would be tested for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Michaels, president of Michaels Opinion Research, which
conducted the study for the foundation, suggested that doctors ask
sexually active adolescents whether they would like to be tested
for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple question,'' Ms. Michaels said. ``It doesn't get
asked all the time, but when it does, young people will say yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say that acting quickly is important. ``The key to
successful treatment is getting treatment early and consistently,''
said Victor Barnes, associate director for international HIV
prevention at the Centers for Disease Control. ``For individuals
who do not seek HIV testing until they are experiencing symptoms of
illness associated with HIV-related diseases or AIDS itself,
today's treatments cannot offer as much hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The study reported that the teen-agers favored HIV testing in
offices that provided confidential and inexpensive tests. Many did
not want their parents to know.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the teen-agers had called around for cost estimates for
the HIV test and given up because they thought they could not
afford it and did not realize their other options, such as free
testing in some cities.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers also were more likely to be tested by doctors and
nurses who respected the fact that they were sexually active. ``I
wouldn't have gotten tested if the nurse hadn't given me the
opportunity,'' said Ms. Jako, who has received a grant from the
Kaiser Foundation to travel and speak to young people about AIDS
awareness. ``As I was leaving the office, the nurse said, `You've
gotten tested for STD's, why not get tested for HIV as well?' My
nurse and doctor were convinced that I was going to be healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so grateful for their having provided me with the
opportunity,'' Ms. Jako said. ``It is their responsibility to give
us the opportunity to be tested. If they hadn't tested me then, I
could have attributed symptoms I had to other things, and I would
never know to this day that I'm HIV positive.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As evidence that the earth's atmosphere is warming continues to
accumulate, scientists are making slow progress toward an answer to
the big question raised by the evidence: how much of the warming is
due to human activity and how much to natural causes?
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
the group of scientists widely considered the most authoritative
voice on the subject, has already concluded that there is a
``discernible human influence'' on the global climate. Now the
panel is deep into another of its periodic full-scale scientific
assessments of global climate change, to be finished in about 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   While the group's conclusions are unformed, some experts on the
problem say the human imprint on climate is becoming clearer, and
may even have been the dominant factor in the global warming of
recent decades. Not everyone agrees _ there is a range of judgments
_ and virtually all experts say that in any case, a reliable
estimate of the human imprint's magnitude still remains some
distance off.
</P>
<P>
   A number of influences, both natural and man-made, cause the
planet's temperature to vary. The natural ones include changes in
solar radiation, and sulfate droplets called aerosols cast aloft by
erupting volcanoes, which cool the atmosphere by reflecting
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   The human influence stems mostly from emissions of waste
industrial gases like carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the
atmosphere, and sulfate aerosols from industrial smokestacks.
</P>
<P>
   The combined impact of industrial aerosols and greenhouse gases
creates complex and distinctive temperature patterns. It was mostly
an analysis of those patterns that led the intergovernmental panel
in 1995 to abandon its previous position that global warming
observed over the past century might as easily be natural as
human-induced.
</P>
<P>
   Human factors appeared to be playing a part, the panel said
then, but it offered no judgment on whether that part was big,
small or in between.
</P>
<P>
   One recent piece of evidence suggesting a strong human
influence, which seems likely to carry some weight with the
intergovernmental panel, appeared recently in the journal Nature.
Scientists at the Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and
Research, a British government organization, analyzed the global
climate record of the last century in an effort to isolate and
quantify the major factors producing the century's rise of about 1
degree Fahrenheit in the earth's average surface temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The research team led by Dr. Simon F.B. Tett found that in the
earlier part of the century, the rise could be explained either by
an increase in solar radiation or a combination of stronger solar
radiation and heat-trapping greenhouse gases emitted by industrial
economies. But they found that after the mid-1970s, when about half
the century's warming took place, the warming resulted largely from
the greenhouse gases. Other researchers have lately come to a
similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Tett study represents ``another jigsaw puzzle piece,'' said
one expert, Dr. Tom M.L. Wigley of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. ``There is still a long way
to go'' in completing the puzzle, he said, ``but we're beginning to
see the smile on the face of the Mona Lisa, I think _ or perhaps it
should be a frown.''
</P>
<P>
   Wigley was a principal author of the section of the
intergovernmental panel's 1995 report dealing with detection of the
human imprint on climate, but he is not involved in the latest
assessment. If they were writing their report today, he said at a
recent panel discussion on climate, he and his co-assessors of four
years ago ``would now make a stronger statement.''
</P>
<P>
   But other participants in the discussion were more cautious.
One, Dr. Michael E. Schlesinger, a climatologist at the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said that experts had insufficient
knowledge of the magnitude of natural climatic variations,
especially solar radiation, to gauge how large the human impact was
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Another, Dr. Ronald Prinn of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology said that although there was ``accumulating evidence
that humans were having an influence on the climate system,'' it
would not be possible to discern its magnitude until the degree of
natural climate variability could be pinned down better.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, evidence of warming and its effects continues
to mount. Earlier this year, scientists at the University of
Massachusetts and the University of Arizona reconstructed the
average annual surface temperature trend of the Northern Hemisphere
for the last 1,000 years. While cautioning that the margin of error
was large enough to render data from the early centuries
untrustworthy, they found that the 20th century was the warmest of
the millennium, by far.
</P>
<P>
   This and other analyses have found that the warmest years of all
occurred in the 1990s, with 1998 the warmest on record. El Nino,
the great pool of warm water in the tropical Pacific Ocean that
from time to time heats the atmosphere and disrupts weather
patterns, was responsible for some of the 1998 heating.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis by Wigley, however, has shown that when
El Nino's effects are filtered out of the global temperature record
statistically, 1998 still ranks as the warmest year. (This year is
also shaping up as unusually warm, but not as warm as 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   Two studies reported in Nature this month suggest that the
warming is being reflected in patterns of wildlife behavior and
distribution. In one study, Dr. Camille Parmesan, a biologist at
the National Center for Ecological Analysis in Santa Barbara,
Calif., and 12 colleagues analyzed distribution patterns of 35
species of European butterflies. They found that for two-thirds of
the species, their range of habitat had shifted northward by 22 to
150 miles coincidentally with Europe's warming trend.
</P>
<P>
   In the other study, Humphrey Q.B. Crick of the British Trust for
Ornithology and Timothy H. Sparks of the Institute of Terrestrial
Ecology in Cambridgeshire, England, analyzed the nesting habits of
20 species of birds in Britain. They found that, again coincident
with a recent warming trend, the birds were laying their eggs
earlier in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest in a series of studies indicating that
meteorological spring is coming earlier in the Northern Hemisphere.
Some have also shown that fall is coming later.
</P>
<P>
   A third study in Nature this month reported, on the basis of
bubbles of atmospheric gas contained in ice cores extracted from
the Antarctic ice sheet, that present-day atmospheric levels of
heat-trapping carbon dioxide were higher than at any other time in
the last 420,000 years. At 360 parts per million, they are 20
percent higher than in any previous warm period between ice ages,
and double the typical concentrations during an ice age.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced, the United Nations
scientific panel has consistently said, atmospheric concentrations
will continue to rise and warm the earth further. In its 1995
report, it projected a warming of 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, with a
best estimate of 3.5 degrees, by the year 2100.
</P>
<P>
   The warming would not end in 2100, the panel found, but would
continue. By comparison, the earth has warmed by 5 to 9 degrees
since the depths of the last ice age some 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of warming projected by the panel, it said, would
create widespread climatic and ecological changes, including a
shift in climatic zones, an increase in heat waves, warmer northern
winters, increased precipitation when it rains but worse droughts
when it does not, and a rise in sea level that could inundate many
small island nations and drive tens of millions of people away from
the coasts when storm surges develop.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, the global warming debate focused on how much
warming a given increase in greenhouse gases _ say, a doubling of
atmospheric concentrations _ would produce. Though skeptics say it
will be small, the dominant view for 20 years has been that a
doubling would produce a warming of 3 to 8 degrees, other things
being equal.
</P>
<P>
   This is a measure of the climate system's sensitivity to
``forcing,'' as experts call it, by external heating and cooling
influences, and many mainstream scientists say confidence that it
is right has grown.
</P>
<P>
   Now attention is shifting to the relative strength of the
external forcings. This is the crux of the problem of figuring out
the magnitude of humans' influence on the climate. There are
basically three main forcings: greenhouse gases and solar
radiation, which warm the atmosphere, and sulfate droplets, or
aerosols, from both volcanoes and industrial sources, which cool
it.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere has been firmly established and continuously monitored,
though it is difficult if not impossible to predict how much there
will be in the future. Once greenhouse gases diffuse throughout the
entire lower part of the atmosphere they remain there for decades
to centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Sulfate aerosols from volcanoes sometimes spread to the
stratosphere, where they, too, diffuse globally and cool the earth.
But they dissipate in two or three years. That is what happened
with Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which temporarily cooled
the earth by about 1 degree Fahrenheit after it erupted in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Sulfate aerosols from industry generally rise only into the
lower part of the atmosphere and fall out, as acid rain, within a
few days. Moreover, their extent and impact is mostly regional
rather than global.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, they affected primarily the industrial countries
of Europe and North America, but scientists now believe that they
are diminishing in that part of the world because of controls on
pollution. They are growing fast, however, in India, China and
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have difficulty in getting a handle on the constantly
shifting amounts and patterns of industrial aerosols, and they have
a similarly hard time establishing the varying strength of solar
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Some mainstream scientists say that because the earth's average
surface temperature has not varied by more than a degree or two
since the last ice age, variations in the strength of the sun's
radiation must be relatively small during the present interglacial
period. Satellite measurements show some small variations, less
than 0.1 percent, in concert with the 11-year sunspot cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But for the years before 1978, when satellite measurements
began, scientists must estimate the variations from proxy
indicators like sunspots. These estimates say that solar irradiance
did not increase by more than 1 percent from 1908 to 1952.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent Tett study, the British scientists fed into a
computer model of the climate system varying estimates, based on
different proxy studies, of past solar irradiance. They also fed in
the observed and estimated changes in greenhouse gas concentrations
and aerosols from both volcanoes and industrial sources.
</P>
<P>
   They ran many simulations of the effect of each of these
forcings and then averaged them together to see if they explained
the observed global temperature rise _ and to determine what weight
each should be given. Since the 1970s, the simulations revealed,
global warming cannot be explained without a large impact from
greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger, the University of Illinois climatologist, says he
has ``a couple of problems'' with the study. First, he says, the
data on solar variability before 1978 are unreliable. Second, the
climate system's natural internal variability, apart from external
forcings, is quite large relative to the observed warming and has
not been well quantified.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he says, there is a growing body of evidence that
the warming in the early part of the century resulted from a
natural oscillation in the surface temperature of the North
Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The larger point, Schlesinger says, is that the climate system's
internal variations may be so large that they render the Tett
findings' statistical significance weaker. Nonetheless, Tett says
he believes the findings strengthen the United Nations panel's 1995
conclusion about a human impact on climate.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle to gauge that impact goes on. ``The important
question,'' Prinn says, ``is numbers'' _ precise estimates of the
relative weight of natural and human factors. ``It could be there
are big environmental issues involved here,'' he says, ``or
relatively modest ones.

AMID NEW CONFUSION, THE INDIA-PAKISTAN WAR OF WORDS AND WEAPONS
CONTINUES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Seven weeks into an ever-intensifying war of
words and weapons, India and Pakistan on Monday could not even
agree about whether a Pakistani envoy had come to New Delhi over
the weekend to deliver a diplomatic message.
</P>
<P>
   According to Indian officials, Niaz Naik, a former Pakistani
foreign secretary, arrived in the capital with a communique from
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The envoy reportedly met with India's
prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and his national security
adviser, Brajesh Mishra.
</P>
<P>
   In Islamabad, Zamir Akram, a senior official in the foreign
ministry, denied that any message had been sent at all. ``It's all
wrong,'' he told a Pakistani news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Naik himself said: ``It's all speculation. There was no secret
visit.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes with these bitter adversaries _ the world's two
newest nuclear powers _ their versions of reality during the
current conflict evolving with barely any overlap.
</P>
<P>
   In India, it is widely presumed that the hundreds of invaders
who have crossed the border and taken up positions in the daunting,
windswept mountains of Kashmir are part of a Pakistani operation
that combines specially trained army regulars with a legion of
Islamic militant volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, news accounts depict the incursion as a valorous
effort by tenacious ``freedom fighters'' who are supported by the
Islamabad government only with good wishes and devout prayers.
</P>
<P>
   In India, each day brings fresh accounts of air strikes with
``excellent results'' and successful, if painstaking, uphill climbs
that end with brave soldiers' overpowering the intruders in
hand-to-hand combat. Precise body counts are given. To date, the
Indians say, 398 Pakistani soldiers have been killed along with 123
Islamic militants _ a remarkable toll compared with far more modest
Indian losses.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, the ``freedom fighters,'' also respectfully known
as the mujahedeen, are said to whipping the better-armed Indians,
surviving the continuing onslaught of air raids by hiding out in
caves and stone fortifications.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any single undeniable truth, it is that this is a
very dangerous situation with the potential to escalate from a
confined scrap along the ridge lines of remote peaks to the fourth
all-out war these two nations have fought.
</P>
<P>
   Statements from the leaders of both countries seem to fluctuate
daily between threatening swagger and professed restraint.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Indian government has thus far held its troops
back from crossing into the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir.
As a result, they cannot use their superior numbers to surround the
enemy and choke off their supply lines. It has forced the military
to fight with ``one arm tied behind our backs,'' as many Indian
officers here complain.
</P>
<P>
   But it is uncertain how much longer those reins will remain in
place as Vajpayee's comments burn with impatience.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, while briefing the political opposition on the
Kashmir conflict, he insisted that ``nothing but the complete and
unconditional withdrawal of the intruders will satisfy our
requirements.'' He said ``no secret deals'' would be made and ``no
proposals or mediation by third parties will be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Just four months ago, Vajpayee had personally inaugurated a new
bus route between India and Pakistan. He held amicable talks with
Sharif. The two leaders endorsed the so-called Lahore declaration
that laid a groundwork for pursuing peace.
</P>
<P>
   That declaration now seems a murmur, drowned out by the current
artillery exchanges. Vajpayee said he wanted to continue a peaceful
dialogue with Pakistan, ``but under no condition will we permit any
alteration in the status quo'' concerning Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Many nations, including the United States, have criticized
Pakistan for allowing the peace effort to come untethered. It
remains to be seen, however, if any leverage will be used against
the Indian government. Pakistan, heavily in debt, is known as a
notorious deadbeat among international lenders. A squeeze on
promised credit would further harm an economy that already only
limps along.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif traveled to China on Monday, hoping to muster support
from a nation that has been a dependable ally.
</P>
<P>
   His plans had called for a six-day visit, but late in the day
the Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman, Tariq Altaf, said that
the visit would be cut short because ``of the situation back home
in our region.''

<P>
   VALDEZ, Alaska _ Edward Albee arrived by seaplane. His flight
into Anchorage, 250 miles to the west, had been delayed in Seattle,
so he missed his connection to the commercial puddle-jumper that
would have gotten him here in time. He was late for the production
of his 1961 play, ``The American Dream,'' at the annual theater
conference that (uncomfortably for him, as it happens) bears his
name.
</P>
<P>
   But the hastily chartered seaplane made a pretty landing, and
with the curtain being held at the Valdez Civic Center, he was
hustled to the auditorium by car. As he entered, 500 people waiting
in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Albee said later, cryptically amused as he often seems
to be, ``was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the journey of the theater. Ah, wilderness. Albee (now 71
and a three-time Pulitzer Prize winner) first landed on an American
stage with a brief but biting, bordering-on-surreal tragedy, ``The
Zoo Story'' in January 1960 _ in another remote outpost, Greenwich
Village. It was at the start of the experimental theater revolution
that became known as the Off Broadway movement, a breaking away,
both in subject matter and theatrical protocol, from the kitchen
dramas and photographic realism that had become, via Broadway, the
staples of American stagecraft. It initiated a rapid expansion of
the theatrical landscape that flowered soon after in American
regional theaters. Now it has no farther west to go.
</P>
<P>
   Last week those early days were palpably revisited in this town
at the southern end of the Alaska pipeline, at the Edward Albee
Theater Conference, which was devoted to the 40th anniversary of
Off Broadway. Participants included many seminal figures of the
time, among them the actor and director Joseph Chaikin, the
playwrights Jack Gelber and Jean-Claude van Itallie, and Ellen
Stewart, the founder of La Mama Experimental Theater Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like getting the alumni back together,'' Albee said. All,
of course, are still working, but they found themselves both moved
and delighted by the recognition of their early contributions, a
feeling only augmented by the distance they traveled to get here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just like to say thank you to all the people here who
have told me my work is alive,'' said van Itallie, the author of
the long-running political critique ``America Hurrah'' in the
mid-'60s and the leading playwright at the Open Theater, the
ground-breaking enterprise in collaborative play-making founded by
Chaikin. He added, ``It's really important to me, this
validation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelber, whose fourth-wall-busting play about jazz and drug
addiction, ``The Connection,'' had its premiere in 1959 at the
Living Theater on the second floor of a building at the Avenue of
the Americas and 14th Street, received the annual playwright's
honor, the Edward Albee Last Frontier Award. He was also given the
gift of a world premiere of a play he wrote 10 years ago, ``Magic
Valley,'' a warping-of-the-west tale (a theme that played very well
here) set in a broken-down Nevada saloon. The production was
presented by Eccentric Theater Co., which also staged ``The Zoo
Story,'' a two-handed battle over a bench in Central Park that felt
as discordant here as it did to Greenwich Villagers four decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Zoo Story' was not my first play,'' Albee told the
audience in his introduction, before pausing mischievously. ``When
I was 12 1/2 I wrote a three-act sex farce. It had two faults, one
of which was that I knew very little about farce.''
</P>
<P>
   Also honored was Chaikin, who is afflicted with aphasia, the
result of a stroke he had during open heart surgery in 1984. In the
week's most poignant performance, he gave an eerie, affecting
recital of ``The War in Heaven,'' a radio play he wrote with Sam
Shepard early in his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, another Off Broadway alumnus, appeared at the
conference on videotape, and looking back on the 1960s in New York,
gave a tempered, perhaps mournful assessment of the Off Broadway
movement that seemed just about right. In the end, he said, ``I
don't know if we revolutionized anything; we made a few wrinkles.''
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong event, which ended on Sunday, was the seventh
annual theater conference sponsored by Prince William Sound
Community College. It is the brainchild of the college president,
Jo Ann McDowell, who has in the past lured writers like Arthur
Miller and August Wilson (Horton Foote has agreed to come next
year) with the promise of an honor in an exotic locale. Now,
however, having grown in both seriousness and renown, the event
appears to have entered adulthood; the Off Broadway celebration was
its first theme-based incarnation. More significantly, its play lab
has become formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Run by Michael Warren Powell, who for 20 years was the artistic
director of the Circle Repertory Company Lab in New York, it
attracted 140 scripts this year and held workshops for 54 aspiring
playwrights from 35 states. The visiting faculty _ who included the
longtime Village Voice critic Michael Feingold and the playwrights
Ed Bullins and William Hoffman _ unanimously agreed that the work
was of high quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bizarre, but this is my favorite conference,'' said
Hoffman, the author of the AIDS drama ``As Is,'' who was working
with the play lab for the fourth time. ``It's the most serious one
I know. All of us are drawn here by Alaska, but I keep coming back
because of the play lab.''
</P>
<P>
   For the participants in the Off Broadway celebration, it was a
disjointed week, melding nostalgia and boat excursions to a nearby
glacier, encouragement of new playwrights and hikes up a waterfall
in the summer solstice midnight sun. It was odd, even surreal,
revisiting lower Manhattan of the early 1960s from a shoreline
strip of land lying like a bib at the base of the verdant Chugach
Mountains, a three-leg plane trip from New York.
</P>
<P>
   In panel after panel, the visiting New Yorkers spoke about the
nurturing atmosphere of those years in the city when, unaware that
they were part of any movement, they simply worked and reveled in a
time of extraordinary artistic ferment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Cedar Tavern, the painters there didn't have the name
Abstract Expressionists, and the New York School of poets hadn't
been taken on by Time magazine,'' Albee said. Most important, he
added, commerce had no part in the act of creation; money had not
yet become the driving force behind the arts in general, theater in
particular. In 1960, he said, when ``The Zoo Story'' appeared on a
double bill with Beckett's ``Krapp's Last Tape'' at the
Provincetown Playhouse, ``we put them both on for $2000.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The word innocence was evoked again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started La Mama in 1961, I knew nothing about
theater,'' said Ms. Stewart, whose space has long put out the
welcome mat for otherwise homeless theater artists. ``I started it
because I was interested in the people around me who were
interested in theater. I had a way of sprinkling fairy dust or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course, fairy dust doesn't go as far as it once did, a
point that was being made coincidentally at the same time in San
Francisco, where the Theater Communications Group, the trade
organization for the country's regional theaters, was having its
biannual gathering. There the main business was a discussion of an
elaborate new survey of the field conducted by the organization
this spring that focused precisely on the problems of maintaining
artistic integrity and financial stability.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time the pontoons of Albee's seaplane were
touching down here, the British director Sir Peter Hall, in his
keynote address, was lamenting the dangers of theaters' reliance on
corporate subsidies and warning of its attenuating affect on the
artistic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me we're not as audacious as we once were,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For many in Valdez, though, the clock seemed to take a hopeful,
pleasant tick backward. The town is resilient; it was swallowed by
a tidal wave after a mammoth earthquake in 1964, and of course its
name, if not its immediate area, was tainted by a notorious oil
spill a decade ago. (The Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef,
some 20 miles southwest of here, and the oil flowed away from
town.)
</P>
<P>
   It is now a growing place with 4,500 residents, supported by oil
money and sprinkled with log-cabinish houses of contemporary
design. The wilderness is a quick walk from City Hall. It is, as
many here irresistibly noted, as far off Broadway as you can get;
but as uncharted theatrical territory, it seemed to many of the New
Yorkers, under the undue influence, perhaps, of stirring
surroundings and an active play lab, as good a place as any for
another revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see the kind of theater in New York that caters to a
large audience, well, people tend to copy each other,'' said
Lawrence Sacharow, a frequent director of Albee's work and the
author of ``The Concept,'' which opened in 1969 at La Mama and,
featuring drug addicts enacting their own stories, was a pioneering
work of performance art. ``You come out here, you're not bound by
what you see around you. That's kind of what we all felt in the
'60s; there was nothing we wanted to imitate.''
</P>
<P>
   Albee, whose new work, ``The Play About the Baby,'' is due in
New York next season, was a bit more sanguine. Characterizing his
role as that of mentor, he said he was pleased with the conference,
though he wants his name taken off it because he can't promise to
be there every year.
</P>
<P>
   He met Ms. McDowell, formerly the president of Independence
Community College in Independence, Mo., at the William Inge Theater
Conference there; when she came here in the early 1990s, he agreed
to help her establish a similar event.
</P>
<P>
   The thing still has a few bugs, he said. For one, the workshop
playwrights are getting only excerpts of their plays read, and that
has to change. And as it continues to grow, the jury selection of
scripts needs to be more rigorous. He also said he wishes they
wouldn't do so many of his plays. He does like having his name on
the awards because he chooses the recipients.
</P>
<P>
   As for the significance of the reunion here, he said the Off
Broadway movement had less to do with conscious experiment than
with a confluence of events in the culture. ``There are times when
cultures do wonderful things, and then they just rest for a
while,'' he said. The dominant ``middle browism'' of the theater
troubles him, the pervading influence of the popular, nonrealistic,
distancing forms of movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of the theater is its biggest problem,'' he said.
``You go to a movie and sit with your popcorn and watch people blow
each other's brains out. If you tried to do that in the theater,
people would run out of there vomiting.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, experimental theater _ ``whatever
expands the boundaries of the expression of possibility of what the
theater can be, and which wrenches the mind and the gut'' _ is not
a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Valdez? Does he see the seeds of revolution here?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' he said. ``Maybe not.'' He looked across the sound at
the snowy mountains disappearing into the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do wish it was a little closer to TriBeCa,'' he said.

STUDY CLEARS WAY FOR TRIALS OF HEART DRUG 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Researchers in a small trial succeeded in turning off a
biological agent that contributes to congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published Monday in Circulation, the journal of the
American Heart Association, cleared the way for mass trials for a
new drug to treat the condition in which the heart fails to pump as
much blood as the body needs. The drug, etanercept, deactivates a
protein called tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, which is produced by
the body in response to cell damage.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies had established TNF as one of three substances
within the body that worsen heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Medications had already been developed to counteract the other
two, adrenaline and angiotensin. Researchers doing laboratory work
had then determined that a protein with etanercept's structure
could bind with TNF and appeared to render it harmless.
</P>
<P>
   In the new research, led by Dr. Douglas Mann, a professor of
medicine at Baylor and the chief of cardiology at the Houston
Veterans Administration Medical Center, 12 heart failure patients
received a single shot containing varying amounts of etanercept,
while six similar patients received a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   None of the etanercept patients reported any side effects during
the two weeks they were tracked, and their levels of TNF dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Those receiving higher doses of etanercept had significant
improvement on several measures of heart function, including the
percentage of blood leaving the heart and the distance walked
during a six-minute trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not lead to a cure for heart failure,'' Mann said,
because blocking one biological agent, like TNF, seems to stimulate
others, like aldosterone, to become active.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it will lead to significant improvements in quantity and
quality of life for failure patients,'' he said.

   STRASBURG, Pa. _ This was not the typical audience for a medical
conference, but then again, this was no typical conference. At an
inn set in the lush farmland of Lancaster County, doctors attending
scientific lectures earlier this month were joined by young
Mennonite and Amish couples, the women in bonnets and the men in
suspenders, babies fussing in their laps.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish and Mennonites may travel by horse and buggy and forgo
most modern conveniences, but there is one bit of progress that
they are eager to embrace: gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, conference participants learned, three
children from these communities will become the first human beings
ever to test a new method of gene therapy. If it works, it will
spare them the devastating effects of a rare but deadly inherited
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In the condition, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, a substance called
bilirubin, a waste product from the destruction of worn-out red
blood cells, builds up in the body. Bilirubin is produced
constantly in the human body, and normally, it is broken down by an
enzyme in the liver and excreted through the intestines.
</P>
<P>
   But in people with the syndrome, the enzyme is either absent or
scarce. Bilirubin accumulates, causing jaundice, a yellowing of the
skin and the whites of the eyes. More important, bilirubin is toxic
to the nervous system, and the children live in constant danger of
brain damage. The only way they can survive is to spend 10 to 12
hours a day under special lights that break down the bilirubin. But
as they reach their teens, the light therapy becomes less
effective. Unless they can get a liver transplant, they will suffer
brain damage or die.
</P>
<P>
   If the gene therapy works, the children will have a chance to
lead more normal lives. But previous attempts at gene therapy have
been disappointing. If the new approach, called chimeraplasty,
works against Crigler-Najjar syndrome, it would finally open the
door to treatment of a host of other, more common genetic
disorders, according to Dr. Michael Blaese, a gene therapy expert
who left the National Institutes of Health in January to join a
Philadelphia company specializing in the new therapy. The other
disorders that might be treated include sickle cell anemia, cystic
fibrosis and a failure of the immune system known as ADA
deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left what I thought was the best job in the world to do this
because I believe so strongly in it and believe we'll be
successful,'' Blaese said. ``I think it will really fundamentally
change the way we practice medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaese and other researchers, leaders in genetics and disorders
involving bilirubin, were drawn to Lancaster County largely through
the efforts of Dr. Holmes Morton, a slight, graying man of 49 who
still speaks with the twang of his native West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard-trained pediatrician, Morton first encountered Amish
youngsters with genetic diseases while he was working at a
Philadelphia hospital during the 1980s. He had trained in
biochemical genetics, and he recognized that some of the children
had metabolic disorders, not previously diagnosed, that could be
managed with specific diets and careful treatment of minor
illnesses. But without proper therapy, the diseases could rapidly
cause brain damage. Some parents whose children had died or become
handicapped sought his help for younger siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could take care of them,'' Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he began commuting to Lancaster County, driving from
one house call to another. A year later, he and his wife, Caroline,
and their three children moved to Strasburg. Morton was 39, and
highly regarded by his colleagues, including some who were dismayed
to see him put aside a bright future in science and academia to
disappear into a small town and treat children with obscure
diseases that had resulted from inbreeding.
</P>
<P>
   But where others saw a backwater, Morton saw a need and an
opportunity to make a difference, to develop treatments for
diseases that were taking a cruel toll on children. In 1990, he
opened his non-profit clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of myself as a pediatrician who knows a little more
than average about biochemistry and genetics, and can use that in a
primary care setting to prevent problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His patients think of him in another way: ``He is a gift to
us,'' said Miriam Martin, whose three young children are all under
his care for Crigler-Najjar syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, the Amish and Mennonites, descendants of Swiss
and German Anabaptists who settled in Pennsylvania during the
1700s, have suffered from unusually high rates of dozens of genetic
disorders. The diseases occur because the communities arose from a
small population of founders, and members, who are forbidden to
marry outside their religion, marry each other. As a result, many
people in the groups today are related, increasing the odds that
both members of a couple will unknowingly be carriers of a
hereditary disease that does not affect them but will show up in
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have eagerly studied the Amish for decades, making
discoveries that filled at least one textbook on genetic disorders.
But the experts who gathered their data from Lancaster County did
not stay to take care of the diseases they identified.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Morton said it now seemed only fair that the Amish, who have
contributed so much to the understanding of human genetics, should
be given the first chance to benefit from a promising new type of
gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Mortons were about to take out a second mortgage on
their home to build a clinic, when The Wall Street Journal reported
on their work. Within a few months, a flood of donations made the
loan unnecessary; and a year later, in traditional barn-raising
style, a team of Amish carpenters raised the Clinic for Special
Children. A post and beam structure built in Amish style, joined
with pegs and no nails, it rests on a fieldstone foundation and is
sided with cedar clapboards and roofed with 100-year-old recycled
slates. Its cupola looks out on woods and the cornfields of the
Amish farmer who donated the land. The parking lot includes space
for buggies and railings for horses.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish and Mennonites do not accept Medicare or Social
Security, and they do not buy health insurance. Although many earn
good livings as farmers or carpenters, few could afford what most
medical centers would charge to treat the complex diseases that
afflict their children.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Morton, also a Harvard graduate, acts as business
manager of the clinic. Patients are charged $25 or $30 for most
visits, she said, and lab tests cost a fraction of what most
hospitals would charge. The clinic runs on $400,000 a year, she
said: from patient's fees, donations and a barbecue and auction
held the third Saturday of every September, to sell Amish and
Mennonite quilts, furniture, crafts and farm implements.
</P>
<P>
   When people ask Morton if he knows anything about Crigler-Najjar
syndrome, he tells them, ``I know Crigler.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Crigler, a teacher of Morton's at Harvard Medical
School, was also a friend of many years. But 50 years ago he was a
young pediatrician at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, working
with Dr. Victor Najjar. Together, they treated several infants from
Amish families, all of whom died from a mysterious illness that
left them with jaundice and severe damage to the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Crigler and Najjar knew that some of the babies they examined
had siblings who had died of the same condition. Studying family
records, they found that the different families were actually
related, and that the illness followed the pattern of a hereditary
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper published in 1952, they wrote: ``The prognosis is
extremely poor, the patients generally dying in the first year of
life. No therapeutic measures have been found helpful.''
Eventually, the syndrome was discovered to occur all over the
world; in fact, people from New Mexico, Florida, Canada, Kentucky,
England, and Holland also attended the conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Children began living longer during the 1970s, when doctors
realized that phototherapy, treatment with bluish light of a
certain wavelength, could break down bilirubin. Morton now has 16
patients with the disease, ranging in age from a few months to 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the disease is hard to control. Sleeping under the lamps,
known as bilirubin lights, can keep bilirubin in check, but just
barely. Families live in fear of routine childhood illnesses _
earaches, sore throats, stomach viruses _ because they can make
bilirubin surge out of control. When that happens, brain damage can
occur in a matter of hours or days.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, an 8-year-old boy in Indiana who had the syndrome
contracted a strep infection and died two days later from extremely
high bilirubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a message to the families and to me that we had to
think harder about how to take care of these children,'' Morton
said. He has since written a treatment plan that details ways to
take care of acute illnesses and lists drugs that must be avoided
because they can raise bilirubin.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the families escape crises, the children still suffer
from other problems. They are prone to gallstones, and some must
have their gallbladders removed when they are only 3 or 4.
</P>
<P>
   Debilitating fatigue strikes some, especially the older
children. Morton thinks it occurs because bilirubin poisons the
energy processing structures, mitochondria, in both nerve and
muscle cells. No matter how carefully they are treated, children
with the syndrome often look jaundiced. Sometimes people stare at
the children, assume they have a contagious disease and scold their
parents for letting them outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   It is no fun having to sleep without pajamas or a blanket under
bright lights every night. Children complain of being too hot from
the lights or too cold from the lack of covers, and they find it
disgusting that during spring and summer the lights attract bugs.
Sleep-overs may be impossible and vacations are hard, too, because
the lights are difficult to transport.
</P>
<P>
   Four-year-old Dawn Martin, from Mifflinburg, Pa., complains that
she hates her bed because of the lights, and often sneaks out of
it, said her mother, Miriam, who must get up several times a night
to return Dawn to the lights. Some mornings, Mrs. Martin wakes up
to find Dawn sound asleep on the living room couch _ perilously
yellow. Dawn's younger brother and sister also have the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have all these dreams of having a healthy child,'' Mrs.
Martin said. Now, she dreams of a cure.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As children approach puberty, phototherapy becomes less
effective and bilirubin starts rising to dangerous levels. At that
point, liver transplant is considered.
</P>
<P>
   But Morton tries to keep children well enough to put off
transplants for as long as possible. ``These are beautiful,
healthy, active children,'' he said. ``They're a little bit yellow.
You hate to put them through a transplant.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton is hoping that gene therapy works, and is trying to buy
time for his patients until it becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier attempts at gene therapy for other diseases tried to
compensate for defective genes by giving patients normal versions
of those genes. Scientists would attach the replacement genes to
viruses and deliver the viruses to the body intravenously or by a
nasal spray, hoping that the viruses would invade cells and the
genes would then insert themselves into their DNA and begin
working, causing the cells to function normally.
</P>
<P>
   But the viral approach has not worked well. Morton called it
``messy'' and ``biologically naive.'' There was no way to control
where the virus would add the new genes, and no way to make sure
that the new genes would work.
</P>
<P>
   He and other researchers see far more promise in the new
approach, chimeraplasty. It does not use viruses, and it does not
attempt to replace an entire gene. Instead, it stimulates the
patient's own cells to repair just the defect in the gene, using a
molecule called a chimeraplast, a blend of DNA and the related
molecule RNA.
</P>
<P>
   Chimeraplasts are made to match the sequence of base pairs _ the
molecular building blocks of DNA _ in part of the gene that directs
the body to make the enzyme that normally breaks down hemoglobin.
People with Crigler-Najjar syndrome often have a genetic defect
known as a point mutation: one base pair that is either incorrect
or missing. The chimeraplast is identical to the patient's own DNA
except for the point mutation: instead of the defect, it has the
correct base pair.
</P>
<P>
   The chimeraplast attaches to the patient's own DNA, and
activates a system that cells normally use to correct their own
mistakes in replicating DNA. But in this case the repair system is
tricked into treating the chimeraplast as the correct version of
the DNA, and it changes the patient's gene to match the
chimeraplast _ undoing the mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Even the scientists are not sure precisely how the chimeraplasts
bring about genetic changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it works,'' said Dr. Clifford Steer, a researcher at
the University of Minnesota who was been studying the technique.
``We can spend the rest of our lives trying to figure out how.''
</P>
<P>
   Successful experiments in dogs and rats have convinced
researchers that it is time to try the technique in people. Blaese
said he and colleagues at Kimeragen, the company that has developed
the technology, will ask the Food and Drug Administration for
permission to proceed sometime this fall.
</P>
<P>
   They expect to test the therapy in three children, who will be
treated at Lancaster General Hospital under Morton's supervision. A
total of more than a trillion chimeraplasts _ enough to outnumber
cells in the liver _ will be dripped in as an intravenous solution,
on six separate days over the course of a month. With each
treatment, the dose will be increased. The chimeraplasts will be
encased in microscopic envelopes called liposomes, which will be
studded with molecules that will make them attach to liver cells,
where the missing enzyme should be produced.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the researchers chose Crigler-Najjar syndrome as
a test case for the treatment is that if it works, the results will
be easy to detect: the children should become less jaundiced, and
their bilirubin levels, measured by a simple blood test, should
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists do not expect bilirubin to drop to zero, which is
normal. But they hope it will drop enough to let the children live
without lights or at least with less time under the lights, and
enough to free them and their parents from the constant worry about
brain damage and death.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who listened to scientists' descriptions of the
technology said that even a partial success would be worthwhile,
and they were eager to see the research go ahead. They even burst
into applause during a an especially enthusiastic lecture by Steer,
who said he hoped to ``ultimately make this community famous.
</P>
<P>
   Crigler said he hoped he would see the syndrome he identified
come full circle in his lifetime. It has already gone from
uniformly fatal to treatable, and Crigler said he thought
chimeraplasty might cure it.

   ``This is the first time I've had a lot of enthusiasm about any

   Morton invites families to conferences to inform them about
advances that may help their children. But he also invites them to
remind scientists, including some who have never met a patient with
the disease, that time is short and these children's hopes lie with
their research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families and children are here to remind us of what this
is all about,'' Morton said. ``I think people will step a little
faster to get things done, having been at a meeting like this.''
</P>
<P>
   For Blaese, the families' daily struggle came vividly to light
one evening at the conference, when he strolled outside the inn. A
purplish-blue light in a window caught his eye. And then another.
And another and another and another. They were bilirubin lights, he
realized, and a sick child was sleeping under each of them.
Suddenly he knew what it was all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw five rooms with that eerie blue glow, and it really hit
me,'' he said. ``I'll never forget it.''

OUR RATING: 3 1/2 STARS 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _The first thing that catches your eye in Al
Pacino's startling new production of Eugene O'Neill's ``Hughie'' is
that the clock hanging above center stage doesn't have any hands.
It's as if the two desperate men standing beneath it were frozen in
time, suspended in some sleazy Times Square purgatory beyond hope
or salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Written by the 52-year-old O'Neill as part of a cycle of one-act
monologues, ``Hughie,'' with a running time of barely an hour,
plays like a Cliff Notes version of ``The Iceman Cometh,'' the
author's four-hour late-career masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hughie,'' O'Neill distilled his mordant worldview into a
40-proof shot of black humor, bitter epigrams and pitch-perfect
urban slang. Though naturalistic in its plotting, dialogue and Jazz
Age mis-en-scene, ``Hughie'' has a surreal undertow, an
expressionistic tension that permeates the action like ether.
Before you quite know what you're inhaling, you're already under
its spell.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling double duty here as director and star, Pacino, along
with his inspired design team, makes the case that while ``Hughie''
is a miniature work, it's not necessarily a minor one. It's
doubtful this 1941 drama has ever felt more ageless, more vitally
of the moment, than it does right now at the Mark Taper Forum.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the year is 1928, the hour between 3 and 4 a.m.,
the place the lobby of a down-at-the-heels Manhattan hotel. Or, to
put it another way, it is an era of hubristic optimism, at a time
of profound melancholy, in a part of America where the principal
order of business is to sucker or be suckered.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Erie Smith (Pacino), a small-time gambler and
part-time petty hood, has come to unload his last respects to
Hughie, the hotel's recently deceased night clerk and Erie's
personal talisman. Despondent over Hughie's death, Erie is coming
off a five-day drinking binge, ready to pour out his life story to
Hughie's unwitting replacement, a stone-faced fellow named, of all
things, Charlie Hughes (Paul Benedict).
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 55 minutes, Erie will reminisce about his dead
friend with a mixture of fondness and scorn, crack off-color jokes,
and boast about the ponies he bets and the Ziegfeld dolls he
supposedly beds. Hughes will pretend to listen while his own mind
goes sleep-walking through the dark city streets, in search of its
own lurid fictions. For all their differences, Erie, the shabby
hustler, and Hughes the bored family man, will become locked in a
waltz of co-dependent delusion.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially an extended monologue in which Erie slices open a
vein and the night clerk watches him bleed raw emotion, ``Hughie''
contains some of the most elaborate stage notes ever written.
O'Neill supplied the night clerk with line after line of unspoken
ruminations, giving the actor playing him some way of pacing his
character's emotional evolution while Erie spills his guts.
</P>
<P>
   In conceiving this production, Pacino had the bright idea of
letting Benedict speak the clerk's thoughts aloud, using miking
that gives them a sepulchral echo. This effect, alternately creepy
and ironically amusing, combined with David Gallo's set design of
oppressive cutaways of skyscrapers and fire escapes, Donald
Holder's Edward Hopper-esque lighting and Jon Gottlieb's sound
design of rumbling motor cars and far-off snatches of music, casts
a suitably metaphysical pall over the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully offsetting these abstract elements, Pacino makes Erie
emphatically, almost heroically, of the fleshy here and now. Manic
enthusiasm and scrappy self-importance come easily to this actor,
who falters only when he tries to dredge deep feelings from a man
rarely prone to self-excavation.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about this sentimental mercenary seems fittingly
oversized: his sexual bravado, his rumpled off-white suit, and the
painful isolation that surrounds his life. Pacino inflates Erie's
low-life defeats to near-tragic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Making the most of what could have been an invisible role,
Benedict conveys wary humor and mild-mannered reserve masking a
raging inner resignation. Though Benedict can't make the night
clerk's last-minute conversion fully plausible, he and Pacino turn
their duet into a dirge of sublime dissonance.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years after ``Hughie'' was written, Pacino has exhumed
from this rarely produced play O'Neill's masterly and concise
summing-up of existence. It's a creative eulogy for an artist who'd
concluded that romance and fatalism, success and failure, are but
twin sides of a two-headed coin. Whichever way you call it, the
odds don't exactly look great. &QL;

 &HT;    Newsweek looks at anger against newly rich
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The economy is booming and the stock market is soaring. So why,
Newsweek ($3.50) asks, are so many Americans grumpy? The problem
is, many of us think our friends and neighbors are getting rich and
we're not. As stories circulate about young entrepreneurs hitting
the jackpot on the Internet, the traditional road to wealth _ hard
work and perseverance _ seems as outdated as a vacuum tube
computer. ``In this age of Outlandish Expectations,'' Adam Bryant
writes, ``even Horatio Alger might be tempted to trade stocks
online.''
</P>
<P>
   CRUISING: Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is one of the
most talked-about films since ``The Phantom Menace,'' mainly
because of the shroud of secrecy around the project. In this week's
Time ($3.50), critic Richard Schickel previews the film and dispels
some of the myths surrounding it. Contrary to some reports, Tom
Cruise and Nicole Kidman do not play psychiatrists in the movie.
Cruise is a doctor and Kidman is a former art gallery manager. Yes,
there are nude scenes and an orgy, but, says Kubrick's widow,
Christiane: ``It has nothing to do with sex and everything to do
with fear.'' As for how intimate Cruise and Kidman get on the
screen, Schickel is keeping his mouth wide shut.
</P>
<P>
   SEX SYMBOLS: For a double dose of male pulchritude, take a look
at New York's ($3.99) cover story on Ricky Martin and W magazine's
($3.95) 30-page photo spread of Brad Pitt. In an interview about as
thin as the magazine's pages, pop star Martin talks about the
growing Latin influence in music (``It's a phenomenon''), working
with Madonna (``I learned a lot''), and his sex life (``I leave it
for my room and lock the door''). The grim and gritty Steven Klein
photographs of Pitt in W reflect the actor's new role in ``Fight
Club.'' In the film, Pitt plays the founder of an underground
network of clubs where men pair off to pound each other with their
bare fists until they can't fight anymore.
</P>
<P>
   LATIN AMERICA: Ricky Martin is not the only Latino shaking up
American culture. George ($2.95) examines the Latin influence in
movies, music and politics, and focuses on some of North America's
new players. Among those profiled are novelist Oscar Hijuelos,
White House Deputy Chief of Staff Maria Echaveste, actor John
Leguizamo and actress Salma Hayek. And that's just the beginning.
Out of 800,000 people who immigrated to the U.S. in 1997, the
magazine reports, 400,000 were Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   OUR TOWN: In its most appetizing issue to date, Atlanta's
($3.50) summer dining issue offers a guide to 25 gourmet meals
under $25. Among the choice restaurants: Hong Kong Gourmet, Agnes &AMP;
Muriel's, Watershed and the Crazy Cuban. But when money is no
object, dining critic Christiane Lauterbach recommends Fusebox,
Floatway Cafe, Bone's or Seeger's, among others. . . . Atlanta
Citymag ($3.95), formerly Dossier, has an interesting profile of
Philip Osborne, a Hemingway look-alike and founder of the
Atlanta-based Bush Homes of Africa Safari. Osborne, 67, tells some
hair-raising tales of being rushed by an elephant herd and scaling
Mount Kilimanjaro when he was 65.
</P>
<P>
   THAT'S LIFE: What makes boys and girls different? Besides the
obvious physical things, it's mostly chemistry, says Pulitzer
Prize-winning writer Deborah Blum in the July issue of Life
($2.95). Human males are likely to produce seven to 10 times more
testosterone than females. As a result, boys tend to be more
rough-and-tumble than girls. This is reflected in play patterns as
early as preschool, Blum says. Boys tend to gather in large,
competitive groups and play games that have clear winners and
losers. Girls prefer small groups, playing theatrical games that
don't feature hierarchy or winners. There are exceptions, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   MEN STUFF: The July/August issue of Maxim ($3.50) is obviously
aimed at boosting testosterone levels. A scantily clad Michelle
Williams of TV's ``Dawson Creek'' is used as a cover tease to more
revealing photos and profiles of Hollywood's ``10 Sexiest
Nymphets.'' Those making the list include Reese Witherspoon of
``Cruel Intentions,'' Jennifer Love Hewitt of ``Party of Five'' and
Sarah Michelle Gellar of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' Also of note
is a list of the 50 greatest guys of the century, which includes
Hank Aaron, Muhammad Ali, Ray Charles, Chuck Yeager, Clint Eastwood
and Elvis _ in his fat years, white sequined jumpsuit and all.
</P>
<P>
   Eye opener
</P>
<P>
   Time ($3.50) features a revealing interview with Tom Cruise and
Nicole Kidman and a preview of their much-touted film, ``Eyes Wide
Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Latin beat
</P>
<P>
   Actress Salma Hayek strikes a patriotic pose for George's
($2.95) package on the Latino influence in politics, sports and
entertainment.

` GHOSTBUSTERS' OFFERS MORE ON DVD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Ghostbusters'' is being released on DVD today
with all the bells and whistles _ more like bells, whistles,
tympani and chimes _ that make this format a delight for film
lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Most DVDs, which are the same size as compact discs, contain
extras such as deleted scenes or trailers, but the digitally
remastered version of the 1984 hit comedy has pushed the envelope.
There are three featurettes on the film _ one recent and one '84
``making of'' _ along with one on the special effects. There are
three ways to watch the film _ the normal way; with commentary from
``Ghostbusters' '' director Ivan Reitman, writer/actor Harold Ramis
and producer Joe Medjuck, who appear in silhouette _ sort of like
``Mystery Science Theatre 3000'' _ as they talk; and with subtitles
drawn from a book about the making of the film (reminiscent of
``Pop-Up Videos'' on VH1).
</P>
<P>
   There are also animated 3-D menus and a split-screen comparison
of the film with its original storyboards. If you have a computer
equipped with a DVD-ROM drive, you can connect to the
``Ghostbusters'' site on the Web, where you can find the original
shooting script, which is hyperlinked to the film so you can
compare what was scripted to what made it on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Overkill? Not if you're interested in the process of filmmaking.
For instance, you find out from the commentary that much of the
script was changed in production. With comic talents like Bill
Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Rick Moranis, who have improv backgrounds,
it's not surprising there was a lot of ad-libbing. The
special-effects featurette is fascinating, considering how good the
effects are and how far FX technology has advanced.
</P>
<P>
   And even if all this is just too much to digest at one sitting,
the Columbia Pictures release, priced at $25, is lots of fun. And
unlike most videos, it is something you can keep going back to. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, wind gusts of 80 mph toppled trees in portions of
eastern Kansas as a complex of potent thunderstorms raced through
the lower Missouri Valley. The storms formed as an inflow of very
humid air intercepted a jet stream disturbance passing overhead. On
Tuesday, a weak cool front will suppress the humid conditions
farther south, setting the stage for additional thunderstorms to
erupt from northwest Texas to Oklahoma, southern Kansas and
Arkansas. Where the storms occur, there will be a moderate risk for
damaging winds and hail.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will also be common along the Eastern
Seaboard as a cold front approaching from the west intercepts and
lifts very sultry air covering the region. Many of these showers
and storms will contain heavy rain, helping to ease the drought
conditions over the region. It is very likely that Boston will have
measurable rain Tuesday for the first time in 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the thunderstorms could be severe across New England
and upstate New York where a jet stream disturbance augments the
ascent of the sultry air. Farther west, drier breezes from the west
will import refreshingly cooler air into the Great Lakes states.

   A cluster of showers and thunderstorms will erupt over the
Northern Plains later Tuesday as a cold front sweeps eastward from
the northern Rockies. Elsewhere, sunshine will scorch the
Southwestern deserts and interior California while clouds and
chilly conditions cling to the Northwest Coast.

   Focus: Returning Rains
</P>
<P>
   After a dry winter and spring, the rains of summer have returned
to Florida. A downpour in Hollywood, Fla., on Saturday brought the
precipitation so far this month to a record 18.68 inches while
nearby Fort Lauderdale's total stands at over 19 inches. Not far to
the north and south of Hollywood conditions have been noticeably
less wet. Thirty miles south, Miami has accumulated 10 inches this
June while 150 miles to the north only 5 inches has fallen in
Melbourne. The variation of rainfall over relatively small
distances is typical in regions that receive tropical showers like
Florida. &QL;

 &HT;    Story of girl's struggle to leave poverty brings huge response

 &HT;    By Jim Dyer

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's
Sunday edition that depicted the struggle of a young black girl to
overcome a life of poverty in southwest Georgia prompted torrents
of telephone calls from people across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of readers from Oregon to Florida contacted the
newspaper expressing an interest to send clothes, books or money to
help the family of 15-year-old Bridgett Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgett, like generations of her family, grew up in a
three-room rotting pine shack and struggled against abject poverty.
She became one of her high school's academic standouts in Webster
County, Ga., a rural region 35 miles southeast of Columbus, but the
lanky teenager still faces large hurdles and long odds to realize
her dream of attending college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible to see people who are subjected to 18th-century
poverty in 1999,'' said one caller, Jane Griffin, 31, of Atlanta.
``Our government and people like (CNN founder) Ted Turner send
millions of dollars of humanitarian aid overseas when we've got
Third World destitution right in our back yards.''
</P>
<P>
   The article rekindled haunting memories for George Nealy, 44,
who fled Webster County's poverty in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can relate to that family's struggle, to working the fields
and picking peas for $2 a day,'' he said. ``Fortunately, I got out.
I hope that girl does, too.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, some people traveled hundreds of miles to Preston,
Bridgett's hometown, to seek out the teen-age girl and offer her
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been coming or calling all day,'' said Vernette
Goodwin, a retired black school teacher who lives near Bridgett and
has served as her mentor. ``This girl's strength and determination
has touched a lot of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin has set up a trust fund for Bridgett and is also
accepting donations of clothes, school supplies and books for the
girl and her family. Part of the trust fund will be set aside for
Bridgett for college. Another part will be used to pay Bridgett to
work part-time after school at the town library.
</P>

Bridgett and her family, the address is:

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The father of one of the boys was asked some
years ago to jot down his life's goals in the memory book for his
20th high school reunion. His answer was succinct, straightforward,
and, it seemed, not unrealistically ambitious: ``Raise two good
sons.''
</P>
<P>
   The other father prided himself on being his son's soul mate.
They had just spent five days visiting the Arizona campus where the
teen-ager planned to enroll in the fall, and recently discussed
their shared opposition to a bill in the state legislature that
would have made it easier to carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   So, on April 20, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold stormed into
Columbine High School in this Denver suburb and killed 12
classmates and a teacher, then themselves, these two men and their
wives suffered more than the loss of a child. The boys' bombs and
bullets shattered their parents' view of the world, undermining
what had seemed to them and others to be 18 years of responsible
child-rearing.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation joined this bedroom community in horror and
sorrow, questions naturally turned to the killers' families for
clues about how and why. The authorities revealed that this was no
spur-of-the-moment attack _ the boys had been plotting their lethal
assault in a journal of hatred for a year. And they uncovered
signposts of trouble: an arrest for breaking into a van,
frightening essays read aloud in classes, an angry Web site spewing
recipes for violence.
</P>
<P>
   But more than two months after the massacre, the most painful
question persists: How could the Harrises and Klebolds not have
realized that something, everything, was seriously awry?
</P>
<P>
   ``Their life has been forever turned upside down and it will
never heal,'' said Victor Good, whose stepson considered Dylan and
Eric his close friends. ``They're looking through everything _ `Was
that a sign? Was that a sign? Did I miss something?' They're
second-guessing their entire lives.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible for an outsider to understand the inner
workings of any family, and the boys' parents, grandparents, aunts
and uncles have all refused to be interviewed. Yet dozens of
conversations with neighbors and colleagues, the boys' friends and
teachers, distant relatives and acquaintances indicate that there
was a fundamental disconnection between the troubled world of Eric
and Dylan and the lives their parents thought they were leading.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews paint a portrait of the Harrises and the Klebolds
as caring, conscientious parents who structured their lives around
supporting their children _ and who believed, from all accounts,
that they were on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   When Wayne Harris, an Air Force pilot, retired six years ago
after two decades of base-to-base hopscotch around the country, he
and his wife, Kathy, returned to the Denver area, where they had
grown up, to raise their two sons near close relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Sue Klebold, Midwesterners who followed the oil boom
west in the 1970s, decided in 1990 to escape the sunken living
rooms of the look-alike subdivisions for the red rocks and wild
deer of the Rocky Mountain foothills. They bought a breathtaking
house that they believed would be ``a good influence for their
kids, closer to nature and away from the hustle and bustle of the
street,'' said Edie Marks, their real estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   When trouble emerged the parents reacted: A year ago, the
Harrises sent Eric to a psychologist and put him on
anti-depressants. If Dylan talked back or stayed out late, the
Klebolds grounded him or took away his computer keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   One friend of the boys', Nathan Dykeman, said that after Wayne
Harris found a pipe bomb in Eric's closet, he grounded his son,
took away his car and computer privileges, and started surprise
searches of his room.
</P>
<P>
   But the reins apparently were not tightened enough: The police
believe that the two boys continued building bombs in the garage
attached to the Harris home, as late as the weekend before the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Other efforts by the parents appear misguided, as though they
were lost in wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Morris, another friend, said the Klebolds were so worried
about Dylan's shyness with girls, for example, that they paid him
$250 to attend the Columbine prom so he would have snapshots to
look back on.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems that Eric and Dylan hid their darkest behavior and
deadly plot behind facades of stability decorated with future
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The outcasts obsessed with violent video games and intrigued by
German rock music and Nazi culture also had pastimes as wholesome
as baseball; they were part of a tight circle of friends, earned
top grades, held jobs and looked forward to life after graduation _
factors that no doubt reassured their parents.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Littleton shootings, the most vexing
question may be not whether the Klebolds and Harrises were caring
parents but whether caring is enough. Even if parents attend every
Little League game, like Harris, or ride bikes with the boys, as
Klebold did, do they really know their children? How much does
being there matter if you fail to _ or refuse to _ see and hear
what is actually going on?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us are so afraid that if parents can raise a child
and this happens to the child, then they can't possibly be good
parents,'' said Carolyn Payne, whose family became friends with the
Harrises when they were stationed at the same Air Force bases in
Michigan and upstate New York. ``But they're just like us.''
</P>
<P>
   A Military Family Returns to its Roots
</P>
<P>
   Living on military bases, people know one another's business;
families get nasty notes if their lawns are not properly trimmed.
Former neighbors of the Harrises recalled a quiet, normal family,
and said they would have known otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't do anything that's aberrant or unlikely without
someone finding out about it,'' said Mark Mayerstein, a retired
lieutenant colonel whose family shared a duplex with the Harrises
at Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda, Mich. ``We never even heard
the kids cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayerstein's son, Lane, and a third boy played war games with
Eric, who lived in Oscoda for two and a half years. ``The three of
us would be on a mission,'' Lane said. ``We'd be out to destroy
this invisible armada.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cedar Lake Elementary School in Oscoda, the family stood out
because both Wayne, a pilot who trained people to fly the KC-135
refueling plane, and Kathy, a homemaker, attended every school
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Wurtsmith closed in 1991, sending the Harrises to Plattsburgh,
N.Y., where friends and neighbors remembered the boys as scouts and
Little Leaguers, and their parents as being involved in the
community and in their children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   When the Plattsburgh base was shuttered in 1993. Harris retired
as a major and the family moved back home to Denver, where Eric's
two sets of grandparents live six blocks apart.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Nelson Harris and Katherine Ann Pool both grew up in
unremarkable homes on modest suburban blocks: His father was a
valet at Denver's historic Brown Palace hotel; hers, a World War II
veteran, owned a hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   In his 20th reunion book, Wayne cited his father's death of a
heart attack when Wayne was 20, as the ``low lite ((sic)) of my
life.'' Kathy's mother, Elaine, is the type of neighbor who brings
over cookies whenever she is baking, and Kathy inherited the habit,
often sending homemade care packages to her older son and his
college roommates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once back in Denver, Harris, whom one acquaintance described as
a ``Leave it to Beaver dad,'' began working at a private company
that develops flight training simulators. Mrs. Harris took a job at
a catering company.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, Eric followed the path set by Kevin, who was three
years older. Kevin was a waiter at a Chili's near Columbine, Eric a
busboy. The younger boy visited the older at the University of
Colorado in Boulder for football games.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Kevin bulked up in the weight room and became a
second-string tight end on the football squad. With an A-average
and varsity letter jackets, he was admired for his leadership
qualities and affable demeanor. ``There's no holes in Kevin,'' said
Andy Lowry, Columbine's football coach.
</P>
<P>
   Eric, gawky and 5 feet 9 inches tall, complained to a co-worker
at Blackjack Pizza that he was not as tall as his brother. Freshman
year, Eric wore a flat top and dressed preppy; by last fall, his
hair was spiked and the ominous messages on his T-shirts were often
covered by a trench coat. He began to abandon baseball and soccer
for a computer netherworld and replace his parents' expectations
that he would go to college with hopes of enlisting in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a little sibling rivalry,'' said Kimberly
Howe, the family's dental hygienist.
</P>
<P>
   Always saying ``yes, sir'' and ``no, ma'am,'' Eric was polite to
adults, but showed a scarier side at school.
</P>
<P>
   The boy Good described as ``the ultimate little gentleman''
began a yearbook message to Nathan Dykeman, Good's stepson, with
the words ``Ich Bin Gott,'' German for ``I am God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate everything unless I say otherwise,'' Eric wrote. ``Hey,
don't follow your dreams or goals or any of that, follow your
animal instincts, if it moves kill it, if it doesn't, burn it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Klebolds: A `Country' House Provides a Haven
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Bennet Klebold grew up in a house without guns _ even toy
guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom was adamant,'' said Randy DeHoff, a former neighbor, who
recalls Klebold saying ` ``We don't need guns in the house; we're
not going to play with them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But by grade school, Dylan was already an ace at Nintendo's Iron
Tank, ``a war game all about shooting people,'' recalled Kevin
Hofstra, a childhood friend. Later, Dylan would make videos of
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The Klebolds had tried to guard against this fascination: When
Dylan and a friend brought home violent movies in fourth-grade, it
prompted a ``big conversation,'' recalled Judy Brown, the other
boy's mother. Two years earlier, Mrs. Brown said, she and Sue
Klebold had ``made a pact'' that ``we would always tell each other
if our kids got into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki DeHoff, whose daughters splashed in the neighborhood pool
with Dylan and his older brother, Byron, back in elementary school
days, said Mrs. Klebold was ``a better mother than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sue was more patient and gentle and kind with her kids than I
was able to be,'' Mrs. DeHoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Frances Klebold was the granddaughter of a Columbus, Ohio,
builder and philanthropist, Leo Yassenoff, whose name adorns the
local Jewish Community Center. Susan, a talented artist, grew up
with an older sister and younger brother in a sumptuous house in
Columbus' Bexley neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susie had this tremendous wit,'' recalled Susan Cohen, a
classmate at the private Columbus School for Girls. ``She said her
family had taught her to always leave them laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Huelsman, Susan's stepbrother, glimpsed a more
melancholy side to her in a dreary painting she did of a girl,
mourning, as the chair she was sitting on appeared to melt like
candle wax. ``It was not one of the paintings she wanted to show to
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While studying art at Ohio State University, Susan met Thomas
Ernest Klebold, a sculptor from Toledo, who later became a
geophysicist. Tom was a child of tragedy: His mother died when he
was 6, his father when he was 12, leaving him to be raised by a
half-brother 18 years his senior.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Sue married in 1971 and soon settled in the Denver
suburbs, where Dylan was born. The boys attended confirmation
classes at a Lutheran church and observed Jewish rituals at home.
In 1990, the family moved to a dramatic house of gray slate and
glass in Deer Creek Canyon, a bargain at $65,000 because it needed
a lot of electrical work, which Klebold tackled happily.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan's second-floor bedroom had a window seat that was painted
black, and a tiny refrigerator _ stocked with candy bars and Dr
Pepper _ that had been a 17th birthday gift from his parents, said
Devon Adams, 16, a close friend. The boy who nicknamed himself
Vodka after his favorite drink had a ``Shooters'' poster that
described how to make cocktails. Friends frequently slept over and
joked that the Klebolds' home was their ``country house.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dylan was ``afraid of the cougars who lived up near his
house,'' Devon said, and preferred to play in a friend's pool
because the Klebolds' pool often had dead frogs and crows floating
in it.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold swims laps every morning and operates a small real
estate business from home. His wife is an employment counselor at a
local community college, where she previously worked with disabled
students. When both parents had jobs outside the home, Dylan's
mother had him ride the bus to the campus after school rather than
be on his own, Mrs. Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold collects BMW's, buying older ones cheap to fix up for
his sons. Friends say he loves to pick apart politics and religion,
using a physicist's analytical approach.
</P>
<P>
   Several acquaintances said that, if anything, Klebold seemed
more concerned about Byron, who had attended a Roman Catholic high
school before graduating from Columbine in 1997, and now works at a
local car lot. Dylan, his father believed, was a mature young man
on the brink of independence.
</P>
<P>
   At a parents' meeting March 27, Sue Klebold bubbled about
Dylan's seemingly bright future, Judy Brown said. Mrs. Klebold told
her friend she tried to talk her son into attending college closer
to home than the University of Arizona, ``but he said he was
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Mrs. Klebold told her hairdresser, Dee
Grant, that the young killer depicted in news reports was not the
Dylan she knew. More recently, in letters to the families of their
son's victims, the Klebolds attributed the murderous rampage to ``a
moment of madness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never understand why this tragedy happened, or what we
might have done to prevent it,'' they wrote. ``We did not see anger
or hatred in Dylan until the last moments of his life, when we
watched in helpless horror with the rest of the world.''

   The Killers: A Secret Plan And Violent Reality
</P>
<P>
   Eric and Dylan marched through the Columbine library
methodically, maniacally, shooting all the way and dropping bombs
in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were laughing and whooping and hollering about what they
did,'' said Aaron Welsh, a 1999 Columbine graduate who survived by
cowering underneath a table in the library. ``One of them said, `Oh
look at this guy's brains and the blood.'''
</P>
<P>
   Their side-by-side suicide an hour later capped a few years of
friendship in which the young men had seemed inseparable. Tall,
lanky Dylan with his wavy blond hair and small, slight Eric with
his awkward half-smile. They worked together tossing pies at
Blackjack Pizza, bowled on the same class team three times a week
at 6:15 a.m., shared a cafeteria table every day and sat next to
each other in psychology, creative writing and video production.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested as a pair for stealing some tools out of a van last
winter, they both pleaded guilty and then car pooled to weekly
sessions in the juvenile diversion program that kept them out of
jail.
</P>
<P>
   In their violent death, many see Eric as the leader. He was the
author of the journal laying out the deadly plot, the master of the
Web site filled with venomous threats. A sarcastic loudmouth, Eric
was always the first to volunteer to read his personal essays in
class, quick to make fun of a guest speaker; Dylan was shy, usually
talking only to Eric in class.
</P>
<P>
   But in life, Eric often copied Dylan, Devon Adams said. Dylan
started working at Blackjack, and soon Eric was filling out a job
application. Dylan put a sticker on his car showing his devotion to
the German band Rammstein, and days later a sticker turned up on
Eric's Honda Prelude.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan, Devon said, had not asked a girl on a date since one
turned him down freshman or sophomore year; it took Robyn Anderson,
the young woman who bought three guns used in the attack, three
hours to persuade him to go to the prom with her, just as friends.
Eric struck out asking three different girls to the prom, then
showed up alone at the all-night casino party afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up in Littleton, Dylan had more close friends, but
Eric _ who complained about his new home to friends back in upstate
New York _ attracted more attention. He glared at people in the
hallways, got into fist fights with athletes, criticized Columbine
and its Rebels, even as he insisted that everyone call him by the
nickname Reb. While Dylan worked in the sound booth for school
plays, Eric's only sign of school spirit was collaborating on
videos for morning announcements, like the one where the two boys
spelled out RNN _ for Rebel News Network _ in lighter fluid in a
grassy park and then set it aflame.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a Columbine Rebel,'' Devon said of Eric, ``he was
just a rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   When the boys were arrested for the van break-in, Dylan was the
first to confess, but Eric told investigators it was his friend's
idea. The magistrate who took the teen-agers' guilty pleas doubted
that it was their first criminal activity, but said they seemed to
have appropriate curfews and household responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad he got caught the first time,'' Wayne Harris told
the judge. ``We haven't had any indication of other prior
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year before his death, Eric had been seeing a
therapist _ first every other week, then once a month. He was
taking Luvox, an anti-depressant, and traces were found in his
body, according to the coroner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole family knew that he was having some mental problems
and getting counseling,'' said the Rev. Kenneth Biel, who said
Eric's aunt, Sandra Birks, discussed it with him.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbine, a school of nearly 2,000 students where pictures
of All-America athletes lined the halls, Eric and Dylan found their
niche outside in the smoking pit. They performed well in classes,
but were far on the outskirts of the social scene.
</P>
<P>
   Expert computer programmers who custom-configured games like
Doom to their own scary specifications, the two teen-agers were
once suspended for hacking into the school mainframe. But the boys
also helped maintain Columbine's Linux server, and taught
classmates how to download from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, perhaps nothing is more eerie than their online
personae. Dylan's member profile on America Online said he ``never
will'' marry but listed a hobby of ``chasing the ladies (with
guns).'' His motto: ``Death will take us so don't fight it.''
Eric's screen name, Rebdomine, played off the Latin for God, and
his Web site was overflowing with profanity and wild threats
against everyone and everything he did not like.
</P>
<P>
   At school, Dylan and Eric both wrote ``stuff about killing
students and teachers, blowing up the classroom,'' said Rebecca
Hein, who was in their creative writing class.
</P>
<P>
   About a month before the shootings, school officials said, a
teacher spoke to Mrs. Klebold and Dylan's guidance counselor about
a violent essay he had written. Dylan, who had also written a
research paper admiring Charles Manson, responded that it was just
a story.
</P>
<P>
   Eric, whose wit and writing style was admired by his peers,
chose guns and war as frequent topics. His memoir was of fake Army
battles with his older brother; when the assignment was to imagine
yourself as an inanimate object, Eric imagined himself as a bullet,
flying through the barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more violent than what anybody else wrote,'' Rebecca
Hein said, ``but it was hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days before the shooting, Eric's hopes of becoming a Marine
were undone after his parents told a recruiter about the Luvox,
which disqualified him. Friends said that Eric was crushed by the
news, and had been growing increasingly depressed as graduation
neared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was leaving him behind,'' explained Nathan Dykeman,
who has moved to Florida to attend school. ``Everybody had thought
for a couple of months that Eric's mood was decreasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both boys were making plans: Sarah Davis, 18, a friend of
Eric's from Plattsburgh, said he was planning to visit her this
summer on a cross-country road trip. And Devon Adams had a date to
see ``The Matrix'' with Dylan and another friend Wednesday evening,
April 21.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of the shooting, Nathan Dykeman found it odd that
his two friends skipped bowling class. When he heard that the
gunmen inside the school were wearing trench coats, Nathan called
the Klebolds. Tom Klebold checked his son's bedroom _ Dylan's
duster was not in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold quickly called the police to offer his assistance. He
was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I can't even speak,''' Nathan's mother, Julie Good,
recalled of her conversation with the killer's father that day.
```I don't know what to say.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after the massacre, Wayne Harris phoned the
family dentist. Eric had an appointment June 30. He needed to
cancel it.
</P>
<P>
   Only later would Harris crumble in devastation. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``That feeling inside where you feel dead, too,'' explained
Derek Holliday, 20, a close friend of Kevin Harris who has visited
the family several times since the shooting. ``Pain, just pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The week after the shooting, Tom Klebold was filled with rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was angry about being detained at his home when he wanted
to go intervene at the high school,'' said Edgar Berg, a former
colleague. ``He was angry about the availability of guns. He was
angry about the access to weird images and videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was angry because he'd lost what he described as his best
friend.''

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The father of one of the boys was asked some
years ago to jot down his life's goals in the memory book for his
20th high school reunion. His answer was succinct, straightforward,
and, it seemed, not unrealistically ambitious: ``Raise two good
sons.''
</P>
<P>
   The other father prided himself on being his son's soul mate.
They had just spent five days visiting the Arizona campus where the
teen-ager planned to enroll in the fall, and recently discussed
their shared opposition to a bill in the state legislature that
would have made it easier to carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   So, on April 20, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold stormed into
Columbine High School in this Denver suburb and killed 12
classmates and a teacher, then themselves, these two men and their
wives suffered more than the loss of a child. The boys' bombs and
bullets shattered their parents' view of the world, undermining
what had seemed to them and others to be 18 years of responsible
child-rearing.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation joined this bedroom community in horror and
sorrow, questions naturally turned to the killers' families for
clues about how and why. The authorities revealed that this was no
spur-of-the-moment attack _ the boys had been plotting their lethal
assault in a journal of hatred for a year. And they uncovered
signposts of trouble: an arrest for breaking into a van,
frightening essays read aloud in classes, an angry Web site spewing
recipes for violence.
</P>
<P>
   But more than two months after the massacre, the most painful
question persists: How could the Harrises and Klebolds not have
realized that something, everything, was seriously awry?
</P>
<P>
   ``Their life has been forever turned upside down and it will
never heal,'' said Victor Good, whose stepson considered Dylan and
Eric his close friends. ``They're looking through everything _ `Was
that a sign? Was that a sign? Did I miss something?' They're
second-guessing their entire lives.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible for an outsider to understand the inner
workings of any family, and the boys' parents, grandparents, aunts
and uncles have all refused to be interviewed. Yet dozens of
conversations with neighbors and colleagues, the boys' friends and
teachers, distant relatives and acquaintances indicate that there
was a fundamental disconnection between the troubled world of Eric
and Dylan and the lives their parents thought they were leading.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews paint a portrait of the Harrises and the Klebolds
as caring, conscientious parents who structured their lives around
supporting their children _ and who believed, from all accounts,
that they were on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   When Wayne Harris, an Air Force pilot, retired six years ago
after two decades of base-to-base hopscotch around the country, he
and his wife, Kathy, returned to the Denver area, where they had
grown up, to raise their two sons near close relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Sue Klebold, Midwesterners who followed the oil boom
west in the 1970s, decided in 1990 to escape the sunken living
rooms of the look-alike subdivisions for the red rocks and wild
deer of the Rocky Mountain foothills. They bought a breathtaking
house that they believed would be ``a good influence for their
kids, closer to nature and away from the hustle and bustle of the
street,'' said Edie Marks, their real estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   When trouble emerged the parents reacted: A year ago, the
Harrises sent Eric to a psychologist and put him on
anti-depressants. If Dylan talked back or stayed out late, the
Klebolds grounded him or took away his computer keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   One friend of the boys', Nathan Dykeman, said that after Wayne
Harris found a pipe bomb in Eric's closet, he grounded his son,
took away his car and computer privileges, and started surprise
searches of his room.
</P>
<P>
   But the reins apparently were not tightened enough: The police
believe that the two boys continued building bombs in the garage
attached to the Harris home, as late as the weekend before the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The most vexing question, then, may be not whether the Klebolds
and Harrises were caring parents but whether caring is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us are so afraid that if parents can raise a child
and this happens to the child, then they can't possibly be good
parents,'' said Carolyn Payne, whose family became friends with the
Harrises when they were stationed at the same Air Force bases in
Michigan and upstate New York. ``But they're just like us.''
</P>
<P>
   A Military Family Returns to its Roots
</P>
<P>
   When the Plattsburgh, N.Y., Air Force base closed in 1993,
Harris retired as a major and the family moved back home to Denver,
where Eric's two sets of grandparents live six blocks apart.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, whom one acquaintance described as a ``Leave it to
Beaver dad,'' began working at a private company that develops
flight training simulators. Mrs. Harris took a job at a catering
company.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, Eric followed the path set by his brother Kevin, who
was three years older. Kevin was a waiter at a Chili's near
Columbine, Eric a busboy. The younger boy visited the older at the
University of Colorado in Boulder for football games.
</P>
<P>
   Eric, gawky and 5 feet 9 inches tall, complained to a co-worker
at Blackjack Pizza that he was not as tall as his brother. Freshman
year, Eric wore a flat top and dressed preppy; by last fall, his
hair was spiked and the ominous messages on his T-shirts were often
covered by a trench coat. He began to abandon baseball and soccer
for a computer netherworld and replace his parents' expectations
that he would go to college with hopes of enlisting in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a little sibling rivalry,'' said Kimberly
Howe, the family's dental hygienist.
</P>
<P>
   Always saying ``yes, sir'' and ``no, ma'am,'' Eric was polite to
adults, but showed a scarier side at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate everything unless I say otherwise,'' Eric wrote in a
yearbook message to Nathan Dykeman, Good's stepson. ``Hey, don't
follow your dreams or goals or any of that, follow your animal
instincts, if it moves kill it, if it doesn't, burn it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Klebolds: A `Country' House Provides a Haven
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Bennet Klebold grew up in a house without guns _ even toy
guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom was adamant,'' said Randy DeHoff, a former neighbor, who
recalls Klebold saying ` ``We don't need guns in the house; we're
not going to play with them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But by grade school, Dylan was already an ace at Nintendo's Iron
Tank, ``a war game all about shooting people,'' recalled Kevin
Hofstra, a childhood friend. Later, Dylan would make videos of
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The Klebolds had tried to guard against this fascination: When
Dylan and a friend brought home violent movies in fourth-grade, it
prompted a ``big conversation,'' recalled Judy Brown, the other
boy's mother.

 &HT;    SERB CHURCH ASKS FOR HELP BUT GETS LITTLE SYMPATHY
 &HT;    575&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRACANICA, Yugoslavia _ On a day that Serbs celebrate a sacred
defeat 610 years ago, leaders of the Serbian Orthodox Church
pleaded Monday for help from NATO in the wake of their latest
national disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The same clergy that two months ago suggested that NATO leaders
were war criminals for their punishing bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia, now threatened to end cooperation with NATO forces
unless their people are protected from ethnic Albanian revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders coupled their pleas with repeated condemnations
of Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia and
their sometime-ally, saying he had hurt ``Serbs'' most -- even in
the face of atrocities committed in recent months in Kosovo against
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done a lot of evil to all. He has done the most evil to
the Serb people,'' said Serbian Orthodox Bishop Artemije
Radosavljevic, citing Serb refugees from Milosevic's wars in
Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders said 80 ethnic Serbs have been killed since NATO
peacekeeping forces began moving into war-ravaged Kosovo province
on June 12. That compares to an estimated 10,000 Kosovar Albanians
killed by Serbs in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Artemije did acknowledge Serb crimes against ethnic
Albanians, and said the church has opposed violence by either side
in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Serb plea was less over numbers than about emotions,
coming on a day of Serb martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   In 1389, the Serbs were overtaken in the Battle of Kosovo by the
Ottoman Turks. The battle was a draw, but allowed the Ottomans to
begin their five centuries of rule over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The day is central to Serb history. A Bosnian Serb killed the
Archduke Ferdinand on this date in 1914, setting off World War I.
Milosevic energized his political career with a speech in Kosovo
Polje extolling Serb nationalism and control of Kosovo on this date
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of how relations between the two countries have changed,
the United States marked the day in 1918 in gratitude to Serbia's
support in the war.
</P>
<P>
   One casualty of the Battle of Kosovo was the Serbs' Prince
Lazar, who has taken on martyr status. His legacy is spelled out on
a monument to the battle today: ``The Serb who does not fight for
Kosovo, let him be cursed forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Serbs are retreating from Kosovo again. Seventy-eight
days of NATO bombing forced Milosevic to pull his troops from
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. While
thousands used to show up for a march every year on this day, there
was no march this year. That's because many Serbs have either fled,
or are afraid to participate.
</P>
<P>
   As half the estimated 860,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have
returned from neighboring Albania and Macedonia, U.N. officials
said Monday, many have sought revenge on the Serb minority. They
have burned houses, committed murders and driven some tens of
thousands out of the province.
</P>
<P>
   But, even Serbs here in Kosovo seem slow to acknowledge what has
happened in this embattled province.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the 1389 Cafe, a local watering hole directly
opposite the Serbian Orthodox Monastery in the village of
Gracanica, Serbs saw themselves almost exclusively as the victims,
rather than the ethnic Albanians.

   Serbian Orthodox Church leaders Monday released a letter calling
for NATO to crack down on anti-Serb crime and threatening that the
Serbs of the region will stop cooperating with NATO unless they
feel safe.

   Bishop Artemije contended the guilty had already fled Kosovo.
``We cannot allow uncontrolled and enraged crowds to exact
justice,'' the bishop told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But, church leaders have in the past supported Milosevic or
served his purposes. Bishop Artemije himself wrote a scathing,
sarcastic, letter to NATO leaders when the bombing started. It
suggested that NATO leaders go before the war crimes tribunal at
The Hague and concluded, ``you are incapable of repentance for the
evil you inflict upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's condemnation of Milosevic actually elicited
laughter from some ethnic Albanians.

<P>
   ``They could have done more earlier. Not now, but when it could
have helped,'' said Ajet Ismahli, a 53-year-old math teacher.
``They know that NATO is here and they cannot do what they had been
doing before, so they are trying to change their manner.''

 LITTLETON, Colo.: boy's mother. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan Frances Klebold was the granddaughter of a Columbus, Ohio,
builder and philanthropist, Leo Yassenoff, whose name adorns the
local Jewish Community Center. Susan, a talented artist, grew up
with an older sister and younger brother in a sumptuous house in
Columbus' Bexley neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   While studying art at Ohio State University, Susan met Thomas
Ernest Klebold, a sculptor from Toledo, who later became a
geophysicist. Tom was a child of tragedy: His mother died when he
was 6, his father when he was 12, leaving him to be raised by a
half-brother 18 years his senior.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Sue married in 1971 and soon settled in the Denver
suburbs, where Dylan was born. The boys attended confirmation
classes at a Lutheran church and observed Jewish rituals at home.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Dylan's second-floor bedroom had a window seat that was
painted black, and a tiny refrigerator _ stocked with candy bars
and Dr Pepper _ that had been a 17th birthday gift from his
parents, said Devon Adams, 16, a close friend. The boy who
nicknamed himself Vodka after his favorite drink had a ``Shooters''
poster that described how to make cocktails. Friends frequently
slept over and joked that the Klebolds' home was their ``country
house.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dylan was ``afraid of the cougars who lived up near his
house,'' Devon said, and preferred to play in a friend's pool
because the Klebolds' pool often had dead frogs and crows floating
in it.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold operates a small real estate business from home. His
wife is an employment counselor at a local community college.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Mrs. Klebold told her hairdresser, Dee
Grant, that the young killer depicted in news reports was not the
Dylan she knew. More recently, in letters to the families of their
son's victims, the Klebolds attributed the murderous rampage to ``a
moment of madness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Killers: A Secret Plan And Violent Reality
</P>
<P>
   The side-by-side suicide of Eric and Dylan in the Columbine
library after they marched through the school methodically,
maniacally, shooting all the way, capped a few years of friendship
in which the young men had seemed inseparable. Tall, lanky Dylan
with his wavy blond hair and small, slight Eric with his awkward
half-smile.
</P>
<P>
   They worked together tossing pies at Blackjack Pizza, bowled on
the same class team three times a week at 6:15 a.m., shared a
cafeteria table every day and sat next to each other in psychology,
creative writing and video production.
</P>
<P>
   In their violent death, many see Eric as the leader. He was the
author of the journal laying out the deadly plot, the master of the
Web site filled with venomous threats. A sarcastic loudmouth, Eric
was always the first to volunteer to read his personal essays in
class, quick to make fun of a guest speaker; Dylan was shy, usually
talking only to Eric in class.
</P>
<P>
   But in life, Eric often copied Dylan, Devon Adams said. Dylan
started working at Blackjack, and soon Eric was filling out a job
application. Dylan put a sticker on his car showing his devotion to
the German band Rammstein, and days later a sticker turned up on
Eric's Honda Prelude.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up in Littleton, Dylan had more close friends, but
Eric _ who complained about his new home to friends back in upstate
New York _ attracted more attention. He glared at people in the
hallways, got into fist fights with athletes, criticized Columbine
and its Rebels, even as he insisted that everyone call him by the
nickname Reb.
</P>
<P>
   While Dylan worked in the sound booth for school plays, Eric's
only sign of school spirit was collaborating on videos for morning
announcements, like the one where the two boys spelled out RNN _
for Rebel News Network _ in lighter fluid in a grassy park and then
set it aflame.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a Columbine Rebel,'' Devon said of Eric, ``he was
just a rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   At Columbine, a school of nearly 2,000 students, Eric and Dylan
found their niche outside in the smoking pit. They performed well
in classes, but were far on the outskirts of the social scene.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, perhaps nothing is more eerie than their online
personae. Dylan's member profile on America Online said he ``never
will'' marry but listed a hobby of ``chasing the ladies (with
guns).'' His motto: ``Death will take us so don't fight it.''
Eric's screen name, Rebdomine, played off the Latin for God, and
his Web site was overflowing with profanity and wild threats
against everyone and everything he did not like.
</P>
<P>
   At school, Dylan and Eric both wrote ``stuff about killing
students and teachers, blowing up the classroom,'' said Rebecca
Hein, who was in their creative writing class.
</P>
<P>
   About a month before the shootings, school officials said, a
teacher spoke to Mrs. Klebold and Dylan's guidance counselor about
a violent essay he had written. Dylan, who had also written a
research paper admiring Charles Manson, responded that it was just
a story.
</P>
<P>
   Eric, whose wit and writing style was admired by his peers,
chose guns and war as frequent topics. When the assignment was to
imagine yourself as an inanimate object, Eric imagined himself as a
bullet, flying through the barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more violent than what anybody else wrote,'' Rebecca
Hein said, ``but it was hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days before the shooting, Eric's hopes of becoming a Marine
were undone after his parents told a recruiter that he had been
taking Luvox, an antidepressant, which disqualified him. Friends
said that Eric was crushed, and had been growing increasingly
depressed as graduation neared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was leaving him behind,'' explained Nathan Dykeman,
who has moved to Florida to attend school. ``Everybody had thought
for a couple of months that Eric's mood was decreasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both boys were making plans: Sarah Davis, 18, a friend of
Eric's from Plattsburgh, said he was planning to visit her this
summer. And Devon Adams had a date to see ``The Matrix'' with Dylan
and another friend Wednesday evening, April 21.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of the shooting, Nathan Dykeman found it odd that
his two friends skipped bowling class. When he heard that the
gunmen inside the school were wearing trench coats, Nathan called
the Klebolds. Tom Klebold checked his son's bedroom _ Dylan's
duster was not in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold quickly called the police to offer his assistance. He
was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I can't even speak,' '' Nathan's mother, Julie Good,
recalled of her conversation with the killer's father that day. ``
`I don't know what to say.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after the massacre, Wayne Harris phoned the
family dentist. Eric had an appointment June 30. He needed to
cancel it.
</P>
<P>
   Only later would Harris crumble in devastation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That feeling inside where you feel dead, too,'' explained
Derek Holliday, 20, a close friend of Kevin Harris who has visited
the family several times since the shooting. ``Pain, just pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The week after the shooting, Tom Klebold was filled with rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was angry about being detained at his home when he wanted
to go intervene at the high school,'' said Edgar Berg, a former
colleague. ``He was angry about the availability of guns. He was
angry about the access to weird images and videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was angry because he'd lost what he described as his best
friend.''

CAETANO VELOSO: COOL JAZZ, BRAZILIAN POP AND HIGH ART 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For pop stars persevering into middle age,
maintaining critical and popular success is a tough business: It
depends upon cultivating a number of different personalities, and
reshuffling them for each concert or record. Year after year, the
audience grows wiser along with the performer, demanding the
complexity that age is supposed to lend the truly gifted. The
Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso, whose concert at the Beacon
Theater closed the JVC Jazz Festival on Sunday, is the paradigm of
such a pop star. At 56 he's got a world-class singing voice, an
old-fashioned gift for high-quality songwriting and an enigmatic
public personality; indeed, he seems to be one step ahead of this
process, using his wiles to cultivate the perfect audience.
</P>
<P>
   In a well-rehearsed show (he toured Brazil and Europe with a
version of it last year), he presented an index of different
angles. He was a singer of intellectual game-poems, carnival hits,
songs obsessively referencing the history of Brazilian popular
music, falsetto interior monologues and deep-voiced boleros; a
pixieish, Astairelike figure who lightly danced his way around his
musicians and the stage set, which was anchored by a huge, hanging
metal mobile and backed by a red scrim; a low-key host with an
easy, reassuring smile, and a mandarin whose grave, deliberate
movements could have been those of a president or a bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Without growing ponderous, the show had literary dimensions. The
title of Veloso's recent album on Nonesuch records, ``Livro''
(``Book''), refers to his memoir, published in Brazil two years
ago. In previous shows, he has read aloud portions of the book in
Portuguese; in New York, he paraphrased in English a passage on the
power of popular culture to recycle high art. Vanguardist composers
of the 20th century, Veloso reasoned, are seldom heard in concert
halls; instead, their influence filters through popular electronic
music. ``Mass-culture trash is part of the 20th century too,'' he
proclaimed, and beamed. ``It's wonderful to be singing carnival
songs and then to say the names Boulez, Cage, Stockhausen. It's
funny. But I am funny.'' Then he sang ``Doideca,'' a 12-tone piece
with a dense, dancefloor beat.
</P>
<P>
   The musical idea behind ``Livro,'' much of which was played
during the two-hour show, is to mix the Afro-Brazilian drumming of
Bahia with the American cool jazz Veloso admired in his youth.
Onstage, the arrangements of the musical director, Jacques
Morelenbaum, made the trick work, most remarkably in his 1978 song
``Terra,'' which changed colors with almost every verse. Within the
11-piece band, muted brass, deep bass-drum thumps, dissonant string
writing and bossa nova voicings on acoustic guitar each bubbled up
to the surface at different points.
</P>
<P>
   There was the light pop tune ``Sozinho,'' which became a
million-selling surprise hit a few months ago after its use on a
Brazilian soap opera; a rocking, ska-influenced song (``Eclipse
Oculto''); a percussive circle-chant samba written by Veloso's son,
Moreno, consisting only of the line ``How beautiful could a being
be.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was ``Manhata,'' whose aerated brass arrangements
bring to mind the Miles Davis-Gil Evans collaborations of the late
'50s; it's a song about Manhattan inspired by the writing of a
19th-century Brazilian poet. ``As we learned the name from the
English colonizers, we accept Manhattan as an English word,''
Veloso explained, entering his professorial mode. ``But if we say
it this way, it sounds like a Brazilian Indian word, and that
creates a subversive Pan-Americanism.''
</P>
<P>
   In a funny way (for, as he said, he is funny), Veloso's work is
one big subversive Pan-Americanism, smuggling erudition and
literature into pop and creating lasting, important music out of
regional culture.

`SWIFT': BREEZILY READABLE AND WELL INFORMED
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(jw) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jonathan Swift died in 1745 he was already a legend,
renowned (or infamous) in his day not only for ``Gulliver's
Travels'' and other blackly satirical works but also for his
involvement in Tory politics and the fight for Irish rights. In the
two and a half centuries since his death, the clergyman's
intemperate personality and scathing prose made him a magnet in
literary circles for a host of speculation. Swift, one historian
noted, ``has been the occasion of more nonsense than any other
writer except Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   There were disputes about Swift's paternity, whispers about a
love triangle with two women, and questions about his misanthropy
and supposed madness. Was he actually the illegitimate son of his
patron and mentor, William Temple? Was he secretly married to
Esther (Stella) Johnson, his longtime companion? Did Swift, an
ordained clergyman, actually believe in God? Did he have sex with
Stella's rival, Hester (Vanessa) Vanhomrigh, or did he remain
celibate his entire life? Did his mother's abandonment of him as a
boy plant the seeds of his anger? Or did his rage against the world
stem from his professional disappointments (e.g., his failure to
achieve a senior clerical appointment in England) and messy
romantic entanglements?
</P>
<P>
   In her new book, ``Jonathan Swift: A Portrait,'' novelist and
biographer Victoria Glendinning tackles these questions head-on.
She has chosen not to write a minutely detailed, comprehensive
biography _ that has already been done by Irvin Ehrenpreis, author
of the three-volume ``Swift, the Man, His Works and the Age'' _ but
to provide an extended version of what was known in Swift's time as
a ``character,'' a written portrait.) Her book is tart, opinionated
and subjective _ at once breezily readable and well informed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glendinning, who won the 1992 Whitbread Prize for her
biography of Anthony Trollope, devotes considerably less space to
Swift's public career as propagandist and spinmeister to the Tory
Party during the last years of Queen Anne's reign than his last
biographer, David Nokes (``Jonathan Swift, a Hypocrite Reversed''),
did. She instead focuses on Swift's elusive personality, piecing
together clues to his inner life from his own writings and accounts
left by acquaintances and friends. She puts Swift's work in context
with that of such contemporaries as Alexander Pope and Daniel
Defoe, and she enlivens her narrative with chatty asides about such
matters as the coffeehouse culture of the early 1700s, the
sanitation conditions of 18th-century London and Swift's use of
scatological language.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the book, Swift emerges as a man who, like
Gulliver, was ``always too big or too small for the company he
keeps,'' a man whose ambitions were frequently undercut by his rage
at the hypocrisy and injustice around him. ``He longs for the
world's rewards but cannot respect the world's rules and cannot be
quiet,'' Ms. Glendinning writes. While he champions underdogs out
of his passion for justice, and ``out of his insecurities he is
pleased to consort with top dogs,'' he ``identifies himself wholly
with nothing that he sees.'' This rage and ambivalence, of course,
would fuel Swift's slashing, often shocking humor and animate such
dark, deadpan works as ``A Modest Proposal'' (which satirically
suggested that the poor might alleviate their plight by eating
their children).
</P>
<P>
   This detachment, Ms. Glendinning argues, was even more
pronounced in Swift's private life. In response to his unhappy
childhood, he ``always defended himself against emotional
dependency and preached that gospel to others.'' His strategy for
emotional survival, she writes, was ``flight from all risk of
grief, pain or disappointment _ at the price of fleeing also from
the pleasure and sweetness which make life worth living for most
people.''
</P>
<P>
   With women, he liked to assume the role of teacher,
patronizingly correcting their faults, while holding himself aloof
from emotional commitment. For years he kept both Stella and
Vanessa at arm's length, playing one off against the other and
making both jealous. Stella, whom Ms. Glendinning characterizes as
``the most important person in his life,'' was cast in the role of
nursemaid, caretaker and confidante, while the more amorous Vanessa
was courted as a dangerous but alluring mistress.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of credible evidence about Swift's actual
relationship with these women, Ms. Glendinning speculates that he
and Vanessa may have ``consummated their affair once and that the
act established Vanessa's lasting fixation and that Swift regretted
it'' as a moment of human weakness. She argues that ``it is
possible,'' even probable, that he and Stella ``did go through some
ceremony in the summer of 1716'' but adds that the couple quickly
returned to their parallel lives.
</P>
<P>
   Though the reader might well question why Ms. Glendinning
devotes so much space in this volume to unanswerable questions
about her subject's private life, she uses these discussions to
illuminate Swift's prickly, elusive personality and his bitter,
playful work. She also uses them to underscore the difficulties of
retrieving historical facts and the role that subjectivity can play
in shaping a biographical portrait.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as a definitive biography,'' she
concludes. ``All the versions of Jonathan Swift _ from the gossip
and Chinese whispers of his contemporaries and near-contemporaries,
to the wilder flights of speculative fancy and the sober gleanings
of scholarship and historical research _ contribute something to
our understanding of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the same man is not always the same man. The living,
breathing, joking, suffering Swift remains a lost original.
Biographical writers can do their utmost to avoid saying, to quote
his Houynhnhnms, `the thing which was not.' To say the thing which
was is harder.''

 &HT;    Gunmaker cites reasons for Atlanta lawsuit dismissal
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's lawsuit against gunmakers should be thrown
out of court because it is barred by a state law passed five days
after the city brought the action, attorneys for Smith &AMP; Wesson
Corp. argue in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's response, filed in Fulton County State Court, is
the first since the city sued Feb. 4, seeking unspecified damages
estimated in the millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta joined a growing list of cities suing the handgun
industry, after successful government lawsuits against the tobacco
industry for health care costs related to smoking. The suit says
gunmakers do not use enough safety devices to keep ``unauthorized
users,'' including children, from firing them.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9, the Georgia Assembly passed a law saying cities could
not file such suits _ and extended the ban to any lawsuits pending
at the time, including Atlanta's.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson called the city's suit ``a radical departure from
traditional concepts'' of liability and an attempt ``to establish
social policy through the court system.''
</P>
<P>
   The company called the suit vague, argumentative and overly
broad, saying it relied on selective facts, ``unspecified `surveys'
and rumors, much of which is both irrelevant and inflammatory in
tone and content.'' It also said the suit violates Second and
Fourteenth Amendments, guaranteeing gun rights and due process.
</P>
<P>
   And the city cannot try to claim damages for harm allegedly
caused to individuals, Smith &AMP; Wesson says. ``The city has not
alleged any direct harm to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The city wants reimbursement for costs such as police and fire
protection and a loss of tourism, said Atlanta's Assistant City
Attorney Bill McLean, who had not seen Smith &AMP; Wesson's response
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith &AMP; Wesson says ``the general rule'' is that such costs
cannot be recovered in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the case hinges on the constitutionality of the state's
law, McLean said, which will be determined by Judge Gino Brogdon
and appealed by the losing party.
</P>
<P>
   McLean said previous cases have shown it is sometimes allowable
for laws to include retroactive bans, as the state's does. ``But
there are also circumstances when it's not,'' he said.

POLITICAL TWINS NO MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To judge by the clumsiness of his abrupt carping
about President Clinton's moral standards, Vice President Al Gore's
political divorce from his mentor is going to be messy _ personally
and professionally.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has no choice but to try to reshape his
identity in order to demonstrate he's not just Clinton's sidekick
but presidential timber in his own right. The brother-buddy act of
the past six years is over. It MUST be over, given Gore's uphill
struggle against the popular Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore didn't handle his maiden voyage into new independence
smoothly last week, provoking stories that his mentor resented the
heir-apparent's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton knows perfectly well that Gore must build his own nest.
Nonetheless the president was said to be furious that his
second-in- command seemed excessively enthusiastic in denouncing
the affair with Monica Lewinsky as ``inexcusable'' and repeatedly
endorsing the marvels of so-called conservative family values.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as usual with the White House, wheels may have been spinning
within wheels here. The cagey president could have been reinforcing
Gore's coming-out by creating the impression of a spat _ not all
that farfetched a concept.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton needs Gore to succeed him, not only to protect the
administration's legacy but to have a good shot at a presidential
pardon if the endlessly vindictive Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr indicts him once he's out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Clinton has been supportive of Gore's ambitions in a
multitude of ways. It is difficult to believe Clinton is so
deranged by a temporary irritation that he will actually help Bush
_ son of the man he dislikes, the president he beat in 1992 _
replace him in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's no way to know for sure, egos in high places being
egos in high gear.
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson, for instance, actively undercut the
1968 presidential campaign of his vice president, Hubert Humphrey,
despite Humphrey's loyal service. LBJ thought Richard Nixon was
tougher than Humphrey and so would resolve the Vietnam War. He
regretted his mistake later as Nixon won the election by half a
percentage point, let the war limp on and tried to sink the Great
Society programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could not have been surprised by Gore's approach but he
might well have been taken aback by its blunt tone. Gore didn't
quite say so, but he left the distinct impression that the
president lied to him _ a communication that might better have been
left confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's new role as presidential candidate requires that he stand
up to, and apart from, his boss. Gore might, however, have adopted
a slightly more ambivalent attitude as he spoke out for the first
time about his own feelings toward the president's misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   This is a delicate path for Gore. Every vice president owes his
influence to the confidence of his superior. Gore has proven over
and over that he can be trusted to deliver for the team. But that
one-dimensional quality is appreciated mostly by its chief
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   The polls tell him that. In recent trial heats against Bush, the
vice president trails by roughly 15 points. Voters say they don't
know much about either candidate. But Gore has been around the
White House so long that they prefer the new guy on the block.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a new poll that reports public satisfaction with
the direction the country is going seems to be reversing.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the prosperous economy, a majority used to say that
we are on the right track. But now it seems the school shootings
and a general feeling of moral decay have led 51 percent of voters
to say we're doing something wrong and only 36 percent to say we're
okay.
</P>
<P>
   What this may mean is anybody's guess, but it does suggest that
Clinton is wearing thin. A majority of voters didn't want him
railroaded out of town because of sex, but a majority also wouldn't
want him to have another presidential term.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody claims that Gore is implicated in Clinton's sexcapades or
that Gore's marital conduct has been anything but exemplary. But
he's Clinton's political partner and will remain so even while he
campaigns for president.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey never figured out how to resolve the dual
responsibility even though Johnson was working against him. HHH was
urged to resign the vice presidency to free himself to speak his
own mind about the Vietnam War, but he refused. He thought it would
be disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can't take that route either. For one thing, a vice
presidential vacancy would make Republican House Speaker Dennis
Hastert second in line to the throne, an unthinkable prospect. And
a Senate fight over confirming a successor would distract from the
2000 presidential race, elevate partisan tensions, make Gore look
like a cop-out and help Bush.
</P>
<P>
   So what can Gore do? There's always the universal favorite: Keep
your head above water and wait for the rain to stop. Time aplenty
for that before November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been counted down before and recovered. Even as a
lame-duck president, he demonstrated during his news conference
last Friday that he retains his persuasive powers and is still a
formidable political figure.
</P>
<P>
   Gore we don't know about. But surely he's learned something
about survival from these years at Clinton's side.

   KOSOVO-SERBS (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ About 75,000 Serbs have
moved from Kosovo to Serbia proper and refugee aid groups say they
are running out of food for them. This comes on top of 500,000 Serb
refugees from Croatia and Bosnia, according to UNHCR estimates. But
the feeding operation is run by the Red Cross and it apparently

others, say it is immoral to obtain them from embryos. By Nicholas
Wade.

   SCI-AMISH-GENES (Undated) _ The Amish and Mennonites may forgo
most modern conveniences, but there is one bit of progress that
they are especially eager to embrace: gene therapy. Three children
from these communities are expected to become the first humans ever
to test a new method of gene therapy. If it works, it will spare
them the devastating effects of a rare but deadly inherited disease
known as Crigler-Najjar syndrome. It occurs when a substance called
bilirubin, a waste product from the destruction of worn out red
blood cells, builds up in the body and destroys the liver and grows
toxic to the nervous system. By Denise Grady. 2,800 words.

   OTTAWA, Ontario _ News tends to travel in only one direction
across the Canadian border, so most Americans haven't heard about
the incident in which a trenchcoat-clad teen armed with a
.22-caliber rifle walked into a Taber, Alberta, school the week
after the Columbine murders, killing one student and wounding
another.
</P>
<P>
   The Taber shootings proved that similar acts of violence can
occur on either side of the border. But for many Canadians, the
contrast with the number of weapons employed and the carnage
wreaked in Colorado also shows the dramatic impact of this nation's
much stricter gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children watch the same violent movies and television
programs, they play the same violent video games, they also come
from broken homes, and yet the rate at which our children kill
other children is far less than in the United States,'' said Wendy
Cukier, president of the Coalition for Gun Control, which has
played a major role in the passage of several laws tightening the
rules on gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Canada already outlaws short-barreled ``Saturday night
specials,'' imposes a 28-day waiting period on firearms purchases
and places many more restrictions than the United States on who can
own a gun. Under a law passed in 1995, every firearm owner in the
country must be licensed by 2001 and all firearms must be
registered by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The laws are not universally popular. The tougher registration
laws are currently being challenged before the Canadian Supreme
Court, and opponents have questioned both the cost of implementing
the new laws and some of the statistics cited by gun control
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Worthington, a columnist for the Toronto Sun, argues that
Canadians are ``really not a gun-crazy people,'' in the first
place, and that the new laws are ``almost a political fixation''
with the ruling Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear that gun violence is far more rare here, and the
balance of opinion is dramatically different from the United
States, also. According to Jean Valin of the Canadian Firearms
Center, a federal agency, 82 percent of Canadians support the new
laws, while gun owners are almost evenly split on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   An incident like Columbine swayed Canadian public opinion in
favor of the new laws passed during this decade: the massacre by an
anti-feminist gunman of 14 women engineering students at the
University of Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique on Dec. 6, 1989.
Maclean's magazine recently listed it as one of the 25 events that
shaped Canada during this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think it takes an event of memorable horror and
tragedy to galvanize and move a nation,'' said Alan Rock, who as
justice minister guided passage of the 1995 legislation.
</P>
<P>
   There is no anti-gun control organization in Canada as powerful
as the National Rifle Association, nor is there an organization
similar to the Coalition for Gun Control, which was co-founded by
one of the survivors of the Ecole Polytechnique massacre. It
brought together a broad coalition, including police and public
health agencies, church and victims' groups and the Canadian Bar to
support the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is different in other ways that enabled gun control
advocates to carry the day, Cukier said: it has a parliamentary
system, which makes it easier for the ruling party to pass
legislation, and campaign spending limits, which make it harder to
buy votes.
</P>
<P>
   But she said since Columbine she is seeing evidence for the
first time that the United States ``could do something, if you want
to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need public support, institutional support _ and political
will,'' Cukier said.

AS MYSTIC MOVEMENT ASSEMBLES, CHINESE GOVERNMENT WORRIES  
(JW)

<P>
   BEIJING _ Just after 6 a.m., they amble one by one onto the
small plaza just outside Purple Bamboo Park, each depositing a seat
cushion next to a decorative urn.
</P>
<P>
   They are a particularly motley crew: An easygoing middle-aged
man in neat slacks and a windbreaker. A couple in their 20s, she
with bright red lipstick and he with hennaed Elvis hair. A small
old man in a Mao cap, lugging a stool.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that they have much in common as they
gather in a half circle around a clean-cut young man in an
immaculate blue track suit, with a matching gym bag.
</P>
<P>
   Then he pushes the button on a boom box that releases soft music
and, in a smooth voice, takes the class through its exercises, with
bits of Buddhist lore and cryptic commands:
</P>
<P>
   ``Put palms together before you ... Move your fingers and palms
in the cosmos ... Golden Monkey splitting its body ... Move the
wheel to your stomach _ hold it as long as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the newest adherents of Falun Gong, or Buddhist Law,
the group that has melded Buddhism, meditation, Chinese exercise
techniques, civics and the mystical ideas of its exiled founder, Li
Hongzhi, into a wildly popular movement. The group has the
government worried.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two months, China's leaders have been involved in a
subtle battle of words and wills with the group _ ever since 10,000
Falun Gong members unexpectedly staged an extraordinary illegal
sit-in around the leadership compound, demanding official tolerance
and recognition for the beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming tens of millions of ardent followers in China, Falun
Gong has emerged as a powerful if hard-to-define force that the
government must reckon with.
</P>
<P>
   The group has no obvious political agenda and claims only a
loose organization. But the demonstration in April displayed its
enormous power to move its members, and its capacity to embarrass
the Communist Party if it does not get its way.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks China's leadership has responded with a blitz of
circulars, government meetings, newspapers editorials and even
television broadcasts, trying to reassure members that they will be
allowed to practice but at the same time to dampen enthusiasm for
the group. The government sees Falun Gong as promoting superstition
and as a threat to public order.
</P>
<P>
   Government circulars have advised officials to discourage party
members from joining and instructed those who are already members
to cut their ties.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days the official People's Daily has published a
number of essays criticizing superstition, which do not
specifically mention Falun Gong but pointedly warn, for example,
that ``some people claim that qigong is mysterious and can cure all
diseases, but this is against scientific knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong considers itself to be a branch of qigong, the
traditional Chinese exercise and meditation technique, believed by
many to have healing powers.
</P>
<P>
   But criticizing Falun Gong requires a delicate touch, since it
pits the party against a huge number of ordinary people who are
devoted adherents, including many retired functionaries.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Communist Party elder and Falun Gong practitioner
has written a letter to leaders defending the group. And recently,
13,742 members in Hebei Province signed an open letter to President
Jiang Zemin demanding the legal publication of the group's books
and protesting persecution of some members who had been briefly
detained, the Hong Kong-based Information Center on Human Rights
and Democracy in China reported.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there have been a few quiet results of the government's
campaign. For example, a small red bookstore here that did a
booming business last month selling Falun Gong books and tapes is
now shuttered with a sign saying, ``Closed for Rectification.''
</P>
<P>
   But at Purple Bamboo Park and dozens of other public places in
Beijing, crowds continue to flock to daily sessions, each
displaying the mixture of qualities that makes Falun Gong somehow
more than an exercise group and yet less than a religion.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners refuse to talk to reporters, and coaches
aggressively shoo away anyone with a camera, reinforcing the
mystery. But the crowd in this park seems not so much defiant as
oblivious to the government pressure _ going through their paces in
full view of the police under a newly hung Falun Gong banner.
</P>
<P>
   Here, every morning, there is a beginner class of a dozen or so
outside the front gate, and a one-to-three-hour practice session of
100 to 200 people on a small plaza amid the leafy hills inside.
</P>
<P>
   Each session involves set exercises, followed by prolonged
meditation. The crowd, which is mostly middle-aged and retired,
thins considerably after 7:30 a.m., when a number put on their
shoes and go to work.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginners' class there is clearly more exercise than
devotion, as retirees struggle good naturedly to get into lotus
position and two assistants meticulously adjust the arm position of
students trying a sweeping movement called ``two dragons plunging
into the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Many clearly seek not enlightenment but health. A 70-year-old
former basketball player surnamed Zhang said he had started
learning a month ago to help recover from a recent stroke. ``My son
suggested I try it, and I've made a little progress,'' he said.
``Of course, I still take my medicine, but I think this will
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Falun Gong practitioners rave about how the technique has
cured chronic diseases from back pain to high blood pressure, and
this has been a major selling point of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I started this, I spent $125 a month at the hospital,''
said a 56-year-old woman surnamed Wang, smoothing her hair after
meditation. ``I was overweight and had high blood pressure and
constant neck aches. In the last three years I haven't needed a
doctor at all.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the group actively discourages medical care,
causing some members to neglect serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   Other practitioners said they had been attracted by the way the
group emphasized ``good moral values,'' discouraging smoking and
drinking, for example. For them the session clearly had the same
rejuvenating quality that others might get from a massage or a good
yoga class _ and they freely admitted that they were devoted to
that high.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to overlook the mysticism, which includes
repeated references to obscure Buddhist deities and one long
segment in which students move an imaginary ``law wheel'' around
their bodies. The goal of Falun Gong is to get this wheel, with its
purported healing powers, to take up residence in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime adherents of Falun Gong bristle when it is called a
religion or a cult, but it certainly has a few of the trappings.
Still, many rank-and-file members, newly freed from headaches and
colds, seem untroubled by the overtones or the ethereal debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's a wheel in the stomach,'' said Ms.
Wang, who used to work in a radio factory. ``All I know is that I
feel better.''

 &HT;    Pepsi employees to enjoy extra pay, benefits, under new contract
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A new four-year contract gives Pepsi-Cola General
Bottlers employees salary increases, pension plan improvements and
extra pay for weekend work.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday workers represented by Teamsters Local 957 voted 173
to 15 to approve the contract with the company, which employs about
250 Teamsters at plants in Dayton and Springfield, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Workers walked out June 17 and did not withdraw picketers until
Friday, when a tentative accord was reached with the Rolling
Meadows, Ill.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that it was resolved and they're back to work,''
said Andy Kinigson, the company's director of employee relations.
</P>
<P>
   Varney Richmond, Local 957 secretary treasurer, said the strike
was a success and helped gain public support for the workers.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract gives workers no salary increase in the first
year. But in return, the company will pick up the full cost of
insurance, Richmond said. Hourly workers get a 30-cent increase in
the second year and 35-cent increases in years three and four.
Commission workers also get a raise, and the company sweetened
pensions for all unionized workers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major sticking points had been the company's desire
to change schedules so some employees would no longer get two
consecutive days off each week. The new pact limits to 10 percent
the number of employees who can be assigned to those shifts and
gives them extra pay for weekend work, Richmond said.

 &HT;    There's no place like the road for the Reds
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The Big Road Machine did the improbable _ some said
impossible until the Cincinnati Reds did it _ winning seven
straight road games against two first-place teams, three at Arizona
and four at Houston.
</P>
<P>
   And by obliterating the Houston Astros in the Astrodome, the
Reds did the improbable _ even more said impossible until The Big
Road Machine did it _ by coming home in first place in the National
League Central.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have to do it again. Same teams. Same number of games.
Three against Arizona. Four against Houston. Only they have to do
it at home _ and for the Reds home is where the losses are.
</P>
<P>
   While they own major-league baseball's best road record (26-10),
only four last-place teams _ Florida, Milwaukee, Tampa Bay,
Minnesota _ have worse home records than Cincinnati's 15-21.
</P>
<P>
   First place? These Reds? This team with a tissue-paper starting
rotation, this team that was in last place at 14-18 and seven games
out first place on May 14, this team whose clean-up hitter, Greg
Vaughn, is hitting .215 and was 3 for 24 on the trip and stranded
12 while driving in four?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, these Reds.
</P>
<P>
   And captain Barry Larkin insists it is no surprise to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprised. I don't know if that's the case . . . maybe you
guys didn't expect us to be in first place,'' Larkin said to the
media. ``We expected to play well the entire season and we just
happen to be there right now. It's too bad we got off to a slow
start . . . but we're here now and it is a matter of staying where
we are and continuing this momentum at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jack McKeon preferred talking about the just-completed
odyssey in Adventureland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tremendous road trip and Larkin was very, very good .
. . but you can't single out Barry without singling out Sean Casey
. . . well, a number of guys,'' McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry especially delivered a lot of key hits on the trip, as
well as Casey, plus Pokey Reese has played inspirational baseball
and Michael Tucker has come on strong,'' McKeon added. ``The
reserves have contributed when we needed it _ Jeffrey Hammonds,
Dmitri Young _ and Aaron Boone started to hit the ball better.
Eddie Taubensee has given us a lot . . . you can go right down the
list and that's the reason you win because everybody does it and
you don't depend on one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does McKeon do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the lineup out there and go hide, don't bother 'em, let
'em play,'' McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup has four .300 hitters in the first six spots and
Tucker is at .290, with only Vaughn slacking. Leadoff hitter Reese
is at .300, No. 3 hitter Casey is at .387, No. 5 hitter Larkin is
at .312 and No. 6 hitter Taubensee is at .311.
</P>
<P>
   Now, can they reverse the trend at home? For sure, a couple of
angry teams are headed their way, eager to put the Reds back in
their place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same teams again, next seven games and it will be a big, big
test for us,'' Casey said after hitting .487 on the trip with two
homers and six RBIs. ``How do we treat this at home? You treat it
like it doesn't matter where it is, if it's a Little League park,
you play in a Little League park. You have to like to be home, home
with your crowd. It's not like we don't like to be at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we know Arizona and Houston will be angry because you
don't like it when somebody comes into your home and sweeps you
three and four games,'' Casey said. ``We're going to have to be
even more prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is no truth to the rumor the Reds have petitioned
Major League Baseball to either wear their road grays the next
seven games or to play the next seven in Phoenix and Houston.

TEXAS AUTHORITIES SEARCHING FOR KILLER ESCAPEE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ A convicted murderer, who slipped out of his
handcuffs, dodged guards' gunfire and cleared three fences to
escape a high-security prison Sunday, remained on the run Monday
after shedding his inmate clothes and spending the night in a tree
overgrown with poison ivy, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 law enforcement personnel, in boats, on foot and
in the air, continued the search late Monday for Clifford Jones,
33, who was serving a 20-year sentence for murder and for the
attempted murder of a Dallas police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said Jones was believed to be
contained in a wooded, swampy area about 3 miles north of the
Estelle prison unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel confident we'll get him back,'' he said. ``It's just a
matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   A heat-sensing helicopter, on loan from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, was used Sunday night to try to locate the
escapee, but the sensing equipment was useless as temperatures
climbed toward 100 degrees Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was the first inmate to escape from a Texas prison this
year. Last year, 16 inmates escaped, including death row inmate
Martin Gurule.
</P>
<P>
   Gurule was among seven death row prisoners who attempted to flee
the nearby Ellis I unit last Thanksgiving. Only Gurule cleared the
fences.
</P>
<P>
   After a weeklong manhunt, his body was found floating in Harmon
Creek, about a mile from the prison. He apparently drowned shortly
after escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is considered dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Jones fled the Estelle unit about 12:20 p.m. Sunday as he was
being escorted from his administrative segregation cell into a
fenced-in recreational area at the prison in the East Texas woods
about 12 miles northeast of Huntsville. The inmate slipped off one
handcuff and shoved a guard out of the way. The guard was not
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Jones then climbed a 20-foot fence in the recreation cage and
squeezed through an 8- to 10-inch gap between the top of the fence
and the roof. Once he hit the first perimeter fence, alarms sounded
and cameras began recording the escape. The prisoner then scaled a
camera tower and vaulted off to clear razor wire and the third
fence, prison officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Guards in a van pursued Jones and fired two shots at him, but
didn't hit him, Fitzgerald said. The escapee then ran to a wooded
area about 100 yards from the prison and stripped himself naked,
leaving behind his clothing and shoes to throw off the search dogs,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers believe Jones continued north toward the Trinity
River, but stopped about 3 miles away from the prison, where he
climbed an oak tree covered with poison ivy vines. ``We believe the
man is experiencing some discomfort at this time,'' Fitzgerald
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that there's ever been a completely fool-proof
prison built anywhere in the world,'' said Gary Johnson,
institutional director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
``... The fatal flaw in this incident was the inmate being able to
get out of that handcuff, and we just need to figure out how that
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said there was no evidence that Jones had planned the
escape in advance or that he had help from outside the prison. He
had not had any recent visitors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, as searchers combed the woods and swamps
north of the prison, crews at Estelle closed in the gap in the
recreation fence, added razor wire to the camera tower and
reinforced other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was to be released in 2007, was convicted in the 1987
murder of Patrick Haynes, 30, who was shot twice in the head on a
Dallas street.
</P>
<P>
   He also was serving time for the attempted murder of a Dallas
police officer who had tried to pull him over. Jones fired four
rounds from a .12-gauge pump shotgun at the officer, who was
wounded in the hand.

BAN ON PROTESTANT MARCHERS CLOUDS PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN O'FARRELL AND KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ The specter of riots this weekend loomed Monday after
Protestant marchers were banned from parading through a Catholic
neighborhood in Portadown Sunday, the traditional flashpoint during
Northern Ireland's summer ``marching season.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Northern Ireland Parades Commission was
bitterly attacked by Protestant unionists as proof that the peace
process was slanted against them, and brought to a fruitless end
the first of three days of negotiations to revive the stalled peace
process. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, who returned to Northern Ireland Monday
to oversee the negotiations, will resume their task Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the tension mounting with the approach of both
Wednesday's deadline for an agreement to form a local government
and Sunday's disputed parade from Drumcree Church in Portadown, a
bomb threat was phoned into a Belfast hotel where Northern Ireland
Parades Commission chairman Alistair Graham was reading an 18-page
decision to ban the march.
</P>
<P>
   Graham moved the press conference to the parking lot, and
criticized the Orange Order, the Protestant group that stages the
annual march, for refusing to recognize his commission or find a
compromise with community leaders in the Garvaghy Road area who
consider the parade offensive and do not want it to pass through
their neighborhood. He said the parade organizers had spent the
last year inflaming the situation, rather than seeking a peaceful
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Yet government sources here suggested that in a meeting with
Orange Order leaders Monday night, Blair had promised them they
could hold a limited march on the disputed route later this year if
Sunday passes peacefully and they continue to negotiate with local
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The parade, which is the most contentious of some 3,000 annual
marches held to commemorate 17th century Protestant victories over
Catholic forces, has led to rioting the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The parades commission had delayed its decision, hoping that a
compromise could be worked out between the Catholic nationalist
residents' group and the Orange Order. That would have boded well
for the negotiations aimed at ending the stalemate over the
formation of a local government, called for under last year's Good
Friday Agreement that was supposed to bring about a peaceful
resolution of 30 years of political violence in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the decision to ban the parade for the second year in a
row has further angered Protestants who say the peace process is
rewarding the Irish Republican Army and its supporters while
ignoring their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists refuse to form a local government with Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political representatives, until the IRA begins disarming.
The IRA has refused to disarm, saying that would amount to a
surrender it did not make. Sinn Fein, meanwhile, claims there is
nothing in the Good Friday Agreement linking the decommissioning of
weapons with its participation in government.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists seized on Monday's disclosure that two men arrested by
police in the Irish Republic last week while transporting materials
used for bombs had asked to be detained in the IRA wing of
Portlaoise prison. John Taylor, the deputy leader of the Ulster
Unionists, said the arrests showed the IRA was still active despite
its two-year-old cease-fire and ``the absolute necessity'' for
disarming the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   But, in an interview with the BBC, President Clinton urged
unionists to take a leap of faith and accept on face value pledges
from Sinn Fein leaders that decomissioning would take place before
May 2000, as called for in the agreement. Clinton said the
unionists could always walk away and collapse the local government
if Sinn Fein did not keep its word.
</P>
<P>
   While Sinn Fein leaders have said they cannot deliver IRA arms,
Clinton suggested the republican movement as a whole could make a
token gesture ``if they decide that the price of failure is far
higher than the price of compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did in the waning hours of last April's negotiations that
brought about the Good Friday Agreement, Clinton is expected to
make a flurry of phone calls, urging party leaders to ``take risks
for peace,'' as he put it.

AGASSI BACKHANDS HIS WAY THROUGH ARTHURS TIE-UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Andre Agassi knew how Wayne Arthurs felt as a child:
tied-up.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi is playing a game of tennis that 11,429 people have
dropped by Wimbledon's Court 1 to watch on a damp, blustery
afternoon _ and neither he nor they have any idea whom the other
guy is.
</P>
<P>
   This could be important. It's a fourth-round match, gateway to
the quarterfinals, beneath low, pouty clouds, and Andre is being
roped like a calf at a rodeo. Instead of a lariat, the lefthanded
chap at the other end is twirling a racket, but the effect is the
same. Agassi is bound and squirming. The program says his tormentor
is W. Arthurs, a qualifier from Australia, but gives no indication
that he will truss Agassi in knots for almost two hours.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century ago, as a tyke in Adelaide, Wayne John
Arthurs, had a net as a baby-sitter. ``My mum would tie me to the
net so she could get on with her own game,'' he remembers. Child
abuse? ``I didn't think so then, but,'' he laughs, ``as I look back
on it . . .''
</P>
<P>
   It was Andre abuse for a long time because of what he classified
as ``a very nasty serve'' after winning, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-5), 6-1,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
   In tennis if you drop your serve it is broken. Keeping it
unbroken is generally the secret of success, and nobody in town had
avoided that shattering experience longer than Wayne Arthurs.
Breaking Arthurs started to seem as likely as breaking into Ft.
Knox, or breaking Bill Gates's windows.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is nastier, slimier than a lefty serving on a grass
court if he's a spin doctor like Arthurs who uses muscle, too, and
keeps moving the ball as though it's a floating craps game. He was
rolling snake eyes at Agassi for so long that Andre thought the
dice were loaded.
</P>
<P>
   This problem for the reigning French Open champion, the guy with
gleaming pate and shots who won here seven years ago, was hardly
evident when Arthurs showed up at Roehampton two weeks ago with his
rackets and No. 163 ranking to plunge into the maelstrom of the
qualifying tournament. You don't turn your back on anybody at
Roehampton because guys and dolls would kill to make it through the
iron _ that appear pearly _ gates of the Big W.
</P>
<P>
   It was there _ ``in the wilderness,'' he says _ that Arthurs
became as unbreakable as Molly Brown was unsinkable. You needed a
sledgehammer or a hand grenade to pulverize his serve, and nobody
could do it.
</P>
<P>
   Games went by. Hours, sets, matches, days, weeks . . . and
Arthurs, a lanky 28-year-old towhead with his roots in Ireland,
hung onto his serve like a leprechaun clutching a Guinness. He won
three qualifying starts. No breaks. He won three in the main draw.
No breaks. If the other guy served tough, too, Arthurs beat him in
a tie-breaker _ four of four in the quallies; eight of nine in the
bigs until Andre snatched the second set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be patient,'' Agassi says. ``I thought it would be a
matter of time before I got a bead on the serve _ but not such a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The best returner in the game needed a few choruses of Elvis's
``Return to Sender'' but couldn't find the tune. He was strapped
and gagged by Arthurs's serve-and-volley offense. ``I knew he was
an Aussie, so he could volley. If an Aussie can't volley he loses
his passport,'' said Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get many windows on grass when a guy is serving like
this. Arthurs had such versatility. He was hitting the corners with
that serve. He kicked it wide to my forehand, gave me the big
bender to the backhand, banged it flat, swung it into my hips . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andre does do windows. His returns sharpened in the second
tie-breaker, crippling Arthurs's volleys. He took the breaker and
they were even. Still, he hadn't quite solved the Aussie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next game, start of the third, went to a lot of deuces
(five) and I had some break points (three). I still couldn't break
him, but I was coming closer.'' After 90 minutes Andre had at least
_ at last _ sniffed break points. Arthurs had to crash five of his
25 aces to preserve serve in that game.
</P>
<P>
   Two games later, however, Andre's buzzing backhand return down
the line was the sledgehammer. You could hear the tinkle of a
breaking serve. You were aware of the splintering of a magnificent
jar of tricks that Wayne Arthurs had crafted to keep 6 1/2 foes
mystified through 111 serving games (77 in the tournament proper)
before Andre pulled himself wholly together and broke the chains
that had made him half a player.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody should have sounded a gong at 4:20 p.m. because
Arthurs's serve, invulnerable since June 14, had been dropped and
broken, the shards puncturing his possibilities. It was the fall of
the house of Arthurs, although he would battle to the end as
Aussies do, ``hoping I've made a platform here that I can build
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre had cut himself loose from the web spun by an unknown who
got his start in tennis tied to a net.

LOOSENING A STRICT FILM RATING FOR `SOUTH PARK'
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Nearly everyone who has seen the new ``South Park''
has termed it one of the rudest, crudest and most outrageous studio
movies in years. The animated film, opening Wednesday, brings cable
television's most foul-mouthed third graders into movie theaters
after months of intense and private negotiations between the
creators and producers on one side and the ratings board of the
Motion Picture Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Association board's objections to the film
have been described in highly specific terms by Paramount Picture
executives in private memos circulating at Paramount, the studio
releasing the film in the United States and Canada. Such memos,
based on what the ratings board told the executives and usually
kept secret, offer an unusual glimpse into the workings of the
normally secretive board, which has been under scrutiny because of
recent accusations by some lawmakers that movies and television
shows share the blame for violence in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park'' has been rated R, which means that anyone under
17 must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian. For months
the ratings board insisted on the more prohibitive NC-17, which
means no one under 17 may be admitted.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the cartoon film unusual, aside from its raunchy
language, is that it is actually about what its creators call the
``hypocrisy'' of the rating system. In the film, little boys sneak
into a movie rated NC-17 and repeat all the graphic language they
hear from its Canadian stars. Parents wage an anti-Canadian
campaign. Ultimately, the United States declares war on Canada
because of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, an odd mix of celebrities as varied as William
Gates and the Baldwin brothers acting clan are skewered. Saddam
Hussein and the devil are lovers. A child is implanted with a
V-chip that gives him an electroshock every time he says a naughty
word.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratings board only cared about the dirty words; they're so
confused and arbitrary,'' said Trey Parker, who with his partner,
Matt Stone, created the ``South Park'' series on Comedy Central and
made the new movie, ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.''
Parker added, ``They didn't blink twice because of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone said the ratings process became absurd to him when the
trailer for the movie was being considered. The raters objected to
certain words but had no problem with a scene in which cartoon
bullets are killing soldiers. ``They had a problem with words, not
bullets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Internal Paramont memos describing what the ratings board wanted
was obtained by The New York Times from a source involved with the
movie who was critical of the rating board's process. The memos,
sent from a Paramount executive engaged in discussions with the
raters to Scott Rudin, a producer of the film, reported that two
members of the 13-member board discussed in matter-of-fact, almost
clinical ways their objections to various sexual acts discussed in
the film. The memos were were dated March 24, before the shootings
at Columbine High School in April ignited new criticism of movie
content.
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Association declined to comment on the
specifics of the memos, and Jack Valenti, the association's
president, said that the organization had a policy of not
discussing the kind of editing it seeks in giving certain ratings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the raters mentioned in the memos and cited only by his
first name, speaking for the entire board, said simply to a
Paramount executive: ``Some people don't want to get specific, they
said they didn't see any way that this could be anything but an NC.
Others said, `No, it's the more stronger things.' And they
mentioned various things.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the memo, another rater said: ``Here's what happens
when we have these discussions. We collect ballots, and turns out
the ballots said NC-17. Then we, knowing you don't want that, say
what is leading you to vote that way. So at that point there's a
discussion. People said, `Well, look what's in the film.' These
things all contributed to the feeling that it was stronger than an
R.''
</P>
<P>
   One rater listed words describing oral and anal intercourse and
bestiality, which were considered objectionable, as well as
disrespectful references to God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me ask you, did anybody laugh?'' asked the Paramount
executive, according to the memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, didn't you laugh?'' replied the rater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very funny,'' said the studio executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do too,'' said the rater.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, some editing trims were made that resulted in the R
rating. The rating board is composed of parents whose occupations
range from teachers, homemakers and postal workers. They remain
anywhere from one to four years on the board.

   Robert Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture
Group, said: ``This is a difficult process between filmmakers and
the ratings board. It is also extremely difficult to discuss in the
context of an article of this nature the level of discussion
between all the concerned parties. But suffice it to say we are
satisfied with the rating that we achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti defended the ratings system and said assertions that the
raters were more concerned about sex than violence were wrong. Last
year, he said, 174 films were given provisional NC-17 ratings for
violence, in contrast to 154 films for sex. The films were edited
to give them R ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to generate publicity for your movie, what do you
do? You trash the ratings system,'' Valenti said. ``The ratings are
not designed to please motion picture studios or producers or
raters. They're designed to give advance cautionary warnings to
parents. And that's the only audience we care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Stone are both from Colorado, site of the notorious
shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, and ``South Park''
is set in Colorado. Stone went to Heritage High School, not far
from Columbine High.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said he took off about three days of working on the film
after the school shootings. ``Nothing seemed funny after that,'' he
said.

DOKIC DOES IT AGAIN; PIERCE THE LATEST VICTIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Her saga is straight out of a bedtime story, and she
could pass for a pixie compared to her elders on the women's tennis
circuit, who include just about everyone. But Jelena Dokic is for
real.
</P>
<P>
   That became indisputable Monday when she left a Top 10 opponent
with hideous delusions for the second time in a week. Her latest
victim, No. 9 seed Mary Pierce, squandered two three-game first-set
leads as she got toppled, 6-4, 6-3, by Dokic. The 16-year-old
Serbian refugee, now based in Australia, thus advances to the
Wimbledon quarterfinals, where she'll face the winner of the
Alexandra Stevenson-Lisa Raymond match.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson and Raymond were among many players who never even
made it to the court as intermittent sprinkles caused four
interruptions and finally the postponement of play because All
England Club officials didn't want to turn these into the world
mud-court championships.
</P>
<P>
   Among the contests in progress that were suspended until Tuesday
_ when more rain is forecast _ was the Grudge Match, Tim Henman vs.
Jim Courier on Centre Court. Hoping to strike a blow for the
English against the man who beat him and almost single-handedly led
the United States to a first-round Davis Cup victory at Birmingham
in April, Henman led, 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 4-3, before play was called
for the final time. Also left hanging were women's No. 2 seed
Steffi Graf, who led Kim Clijsters, 6-2, 4-2; Cedric Pioline, who
held a 6-4, 5-7, 7-6, 1-0 advantage over men's No. 13 Karol Kucera;
and Tamarine Tanasugarn and Mirjana Lucic, who were deadlocked at
5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few fourth-round matches beat the rain, which never would
have been a problem for Joe Mooney's Fenway grounds crew. No. 4
men's seed Andre Agassi became the first foe to break qualifier
Wayne Arthurs's serve here and ultimately served him his eviction
notice, 6-7, 7-6, 6-1, 6-4. No. 11 Gustavo Kuerten put fourth-round
surprise Lorenzo Manta in his place _ back home in Switzerland _
7-5, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3. No. 2 women's seed Lindsay Davenport climbed
out of a two-game first-set hole to beat No. 14 Barbara Schett,
7-6, 6-1. And defending champion Jana Novotna, the No. 5 seed,
swept Nathalie Dechy, 6-3, 7-5, in the day's first match, which
started 45 minutes late because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   But the major thunderbolt was unleashed by Dokic, who had to
survive a qualifier in Roehampton just to get on the grounds here.
Perhaps it wasn't as earthshaking as her first-round ouster of No.
1 seed Martina Hingis last Tuesday. But it may have been more
important, because it established that the Hingis shocker was no
aberration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think beating Hingis in the first round, there was a little
bit of pressure to win a few more rounds,'' said Dokic. ``And I
think winning the next two rounds and then beating Mary today just
proved it. Beating Hingis was probably still in my head, thinking,
`Well, did that really happen? Am I really able to beat top
players?' Then beating Mary today sort of proved it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory also proved the resolve of the 5-foot-6-inch,
126-pound Dokic, who at No. 129 is the lowliest women's
quarterfinalist here since No. 154 Molly Van Nordstrand in 1985.
Dokic spotted the 5-10, 150-pound Pierce leads of 3-0 and 4-1
before reeling off the last five games of the first set, and
trailed, 3-2, in the second before running the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a good fighter,'' said Pierce, the onetime Australian
Open winner who became the latest casualty of the coffin known as
Court 2, the cemetery for a host of major champions which this year
alone has claimed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Richard Krajicek, and
now Pierce. ``She never gave up. She moves around the court really
well and hit some good shots when she was in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nothing seems to fluster Dokic. She has answered every
question here in a poised monotone, even prying ones about her
father's ejection from the court and eventually the grounds during
a tournament at Birmingham for boisterous, inebriated behavior; and
the birthmark on her chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look in the papers,'' she said. ``I just think what's
in the papers is totally out of what's in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality is Jelena Dokic, Wimbledon quarterfinalist. And she
doesn't need to pinch herself to know it's true.

GRAND SLAM PUTTING PUTS INKSTER ON HALL OF FAME TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ Juli Inkster was talking on the eve of the
McDonald's LPGA Championship about the glow of winning the US
Women's Open June 6 at Old Waverly GC in sweltering West Point,
Miss. ``It's been a lot of fun,'' she said. ``It's a huge
tournament to win. I'm still kind of walking around with
butterflies in my stomach. It's a great feeling. It's the icing on
the cake as far as my career goes.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, here is Inkster doing a dance on the 18th
green at DuPont CC, pumping her fists, and adding a few
strawberries to the icing. She entered the history books Sunday
when she put on a remarkable exhibition of putting that even Payne
Stewart must have applauded to complete the Grand Slam and edge one
giant step closer to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   She busted out of the logjam that had bogged down the
championship for nearly three rounds. Seven putts on the last six
holes, 15 over the last 12. She said she didn't sleep well on the
eve of the US Women's Open final round because winning that
tournament was always her dream when she was growing up in Santa
Cruz, Calif. She held a four-shot lead entering the final round,
and would win by four. ``I slept pretty good (Saturday) night,''
she said. ``I felt, if I win this it's a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, who turned 39 June 24, joins Pat Bradley as the only
players to win the modern Grand Slam: the Dinah Shore, the US
Women's Open, the LPGA Championship, and the du Maurier Classic
(July 29-Aug. 1). The du Maurier may pass into history next year
when the contract expires, since the Canadian government has
instituted a ban on cigarette advertising.
</P>
<P>
   To join Bradley was something special to Inkster. ``I just can't
comprehend it,'' said Inkster. ``Pat Bradley is the ultimate
champion. I always thought this was what I wanted to do. Win the
four majors. I won two really quick, but I didn't think it was
going to be that tough. I just didn't want to get emotional or
overwhelmed out there. I felt I rushed up there too quickly in
Mississippi. I wanted to savor this.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, whose husband Brian is a golf professional near the
family home in Los Altos, Calif., had daughters Hayley (9) and Cori
(5) with her and they stayed with a family in nearby West Chester,
where she has stayed for this event the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   She had to work hard to regain the form she showed when she won
the Dinah Shore in 1984 and '89 and the du Maurier in '84. When the
kids came along, family came first.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, she carried Cori in her arms across the 18th green and
Hayley was at her side. They were out there on the course cheering
her on, and she caught a glimpse of them before she made a curling
eagle putt on the 15th that sent her on her way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't think I can still play well,'' said
Inkster on the eve of the championship. ``They're in sports and I
just hate to miss the games and stuff like that. It's not like
they're going to be doing it for that long. Hayley is 9 and she's
been traveling with me since she was born. I think it's time more
to put the focus on them now instead of the focus on me. I'm
definitely going to play next year full time because I want to make
the Solheim team (Bradley is US captain) but after that I will cut
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to have them here today. Hopefully they can look
back on this and say, `It was a lot of fun.' Sometimes I think it's
really overwhelming for them. Everyone around. People grabbing at
their mom. I don't think sometimes they know what to expect, which
is something I can understand. That's why when I'm home I try to
get into their lives and get into things they're interested in. I
think it's important for them to have a sense of confidence in
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The revisted criteria for making the Hall of Fame was
implemented Feb. 9. The prior policy required a player to win 30
tournaments (including two majors) or 35 official wins (with one
major) or 40 wins (with no majors). Inkster is on the verge of
qualifying under the new standards. ``I'm sitting here now and I'm
only 1 point away,'' said Inkster. ``If I can do it this year, it
would be a great capper to my year.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster was paired with Meg Mallon in Sunday's final round, and
this was comforting. They talked walking up 18. ``She said, `You're
making me cry, so go ahead and knock this putt in.' She was great
all day. She gave me some high-fives. She kept me loose out there.
You know, it's a lot more fun to play with a friend out there. I'm
sure she's disappointed with the way she played and wanted a better
run. But she was happy for me.''

ABC, AFFILIATES REACH $45M ACCORD ON `MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e, f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a further restructuring of the economic arrangement that has
governed television for 50 years, ABC has reached a deal with its
affiliate governing board under which affiliate stations would pay
a total of $45 million per year for ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   In return for the payments to the network, the affiliates would
receive a chunk of the revenues from a new cable soap opera channel
ABC has been developing, amid fierce opposition from affiliates
fearful it will steal viewers from them. Affiliates will also
receive eight additional prime-time commercial spots per week.
</P>
<P>
   But what raised eyebrows Monday was the affiliates' capitulation
to ABC's demand that they help defray football costs. If approved
as expected by individual ABC affiliates, the deal would further
tilt the rapidly changing playing field on which networks and
affiliates are now operating.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the networks have paid affiliates to carry their
programming, not the other way around. But financially strapped
networks, facing declining viewership and soaring programming
costs, have lately sought to reorder the relationship by pressuring
their cash-rich affiliates for financial help. It has gotten nasty
at times: Earlier this month, ABC reportedly sent a letter to its
affiliates threatening to yank ad time if they didn't agree to help
with football costs.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, however, the principals strove to present a harmonious
front. ABC Television Network president Patricia Fili-Krushel said
Monday that the deal with the affiliate board is ``mutually
beneficial,'' though she added pointedly that it ``reflects the
urgent need to change our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Scott, chairman of ABC Television Affiliates
Association, said he will recommend that affiliates accept it,
maintaining that it it ``underscores the mutuality of our interests
with the network and provides a framework of stability over the
next three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Cheng, director of programming and communications at
WCVB-TV, Channel 5, said the Boston station is ``very relieved that
an agreement has been reached.'' Cheng said station officials do
not yet know how much Channel 5 will have to pay for ``Monday Night
Football'' or how much the station will reap from the soap opera
channel. Channel 5 is the largest ABC affiliate in the country in
terms of market size.
</P>
<P>
   Giving affiliates a piece of the action from the soap opera
channel, slated to launch in January, may partly mollify ABC
affiliates, but is unlikely to fully satisfy them. Affiliates still
fear a loss of viewership during the daytime and prime time alike,
as soap fans realize they can catch their programs at night.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, ABC agreed to financial ``participation'' by
affiliates in the new soap opera channel. However, the network also
asserted broad rights to the ``repurposing'' on other channels of
its entertainment, sports and news programs.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, like other networks, pays its affiliate stations about $200
million per year in compensation fees to carry network programming.
A reversal of fortune began last year, though, when ABC agreed to
pay $550 million per year to retain the rights to ``Monday Night
Football.'' Almost immediately, the network started seeking help
from its 225 affiliates, many of which did not want to pay for
``Monday Night Football,'' especially since football audiences have
dropped in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But the affiliates' hand was weakened when CBS and Fox
affiliates agreed to help their networks with the cost of football
to the tune of roughly $50 million per year. Then in May, a
bombshell hit the TV industry when Fox affiliates agreed to pay the
network up to $60 million a year for advertising time they used to
get at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fox, ABC and CBS deals are taken together, ``This is a
fundamental realignment,'' said John Rash, director of broadcast
negotiations at Campbell Mithun Esty, a Minneapolis agency that
places millions of dollars worth of network ads each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a challenging era for affiliates,'' added
Rash. ``As the networks are under increasing cost pressures,
they're looking for new streams of revenue _ and their first look
is in their own backyard, with their affiliates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cella, senior vice president of the McCann-Erickson ad
agency in New York, said the ABC deal with the affiliate board
``shows that network television has become a very difficult
business, more of a bottom-line business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the networks are truly losing money, and the
affiliates are realizing it's got to be more of a partnership, for
the survival of the networks,'' he said.

A $10 MILLION GIFT FOR CONSERVATION AT THE MORGAN
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a small space that was once J.P. Morgan's nursery,
two full-time conservators spend their days caring for the Morgan
Library's extraordinary collection of works on paper in cramped
quarters and on a shoestring budget.
</P>
<P>
   A $10 million gift from Eugene Thaw, the dealer and collector,
and his wife, Clare, is about to change all that. The gift is to go
toward building the Thaw Conservation Center, a new conservation
laboratory that will be more than twice the size of the library's
current one, created in the 1940s. The money will also help finance
a larger staff and a schedule of comprehensive education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the new center, the library, at 29 E. 36th St., will
develop a separate exhibition-planning department to handle
responsibilities now carried out by its conservation department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win situation,'' said Charles Pierce Jr., director
of the library. ``This gift helps all our collections. It's my goal
and the Thaws' to create one of this country's best centers for
works on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Pierce added, the library's conservators do not
have time to keep up with objects in its permanent collection
because so much energy has to be devoted to preparing special
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Once the new center is completed, the library plans to undertake
the conservation of the nearly 300,000 objects _ drawings, books,
and literary, historical and musical manuscripts _ that are in its
permanent collection. Some of its expanded staff will work only on
exhibitions while others only on the permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the Morgan should be a leader in the field of
conservation,'' said Thaw, who joined its board 11 years ago and
who in 1994 promised the library his collection of Old Master and
19th-century drawings, described by experts as the finest in
private hands. ``The educational component is as important as the
new facilities. It's our goal to train a new generation of
conservators.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the new center is scheduled to begin in the fall
and is expected to take about year. Samuel Anderson Architect, the
New York-based firm that recently completed the Straus Center for
Conservation and Technical Studies and the Agnes Mongan Center at
Harvard University Art Museums, has been chosen to design the new
center. It will occupy the entire 5,600-square-foot fourth floor
and will include designated areas for various treatments of the
collections, for advanced seminars, graduate internships and
postgraduate fellowships, and for matting, framing and preparation
of exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he planned to take the roof off a portion of the
library's building to install tilted skylights that would exclude
south-facing light, which is too harsh for delicate works on paper,
while admitting northern light. The new center will also have
sophisticated climate control.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Holben Ellis, chairman of the conservation center at
the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, has been appointed
director of conservation planning for the library. Working with
Patricia Reyes, the library's chief conservator, Ms. Ellis will be
responsible for the new center's design and for a graduate-level
educational program, an international exchange, a research network
and staff. Ms. Ellis will continue as chairman and professor at the
institute while overseeing the creation of the new center.

COMPAQ REVAMPS ALTAVISTA WEB SEARCH SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. unveiled a major overhaul of its AltaVista
Internet search service, even as Compaq continues negotiations to
sell the AltaVista subsidiary to CMGI Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to become the Internet's premier information
and commerce network,'' said AltaVista chief executive Rod Schrock.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has a long way to go. According to Media Metrix
Inc., AltaVista's sites attracted 10.6 million visitors in May,
making it the 10th most popular destination on the World Wide Web.
But Alta Vista is far behind Yahoo, with 31 million visitors, or
America Online, with 46 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schrock said AltaVista won't fight back by copying Yahoo and
appealing to the broad majority of Internet users. Instead,
AltaVista will target more experienced, knowledgeable users.
</P>
<P>
   One way to do this is a new ``freshness guarantee.'' AltaVista
promises to completely refresh its index of Web pages at least
every 28 days, thereby providing the latest listings of what's
available on line. Schrock also vowed to make AltaVista the largest
Web index on earth, capable of listing a billion pages. He said
AltaVista plans to achieve this goal within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AltaVista has introduced a host of new services to
attract more visitors. One is a ``microportal'' program that runs
on a user's own computer. It's a miniature browser that provides
news updates and instant access to the AltaVista search service.
Schrock said the company hopes to have 2 million microportal users
by early next year and 10 million by early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced 40 new local portals to provide news
and event information for particular cities. For example, the
company has teamed with the Houston Chronicle to produce a portal
targeted to the Houston area, where Compaq is based. Other cities
set for portals include San Francisco, Seattle, Paris, and
Victoria, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista also showed off its new Ultrastore, an on-line
retailing and auction service based on technology from
Shopping.com, a company acquired by Compaq earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Schrock said the changes announced Monday are just the
beginning. He said AltaVista plans to roll out 25 new search
services by year's end, and that the company will launch a major
advertising campaign to raise its public profile. AltaVista is even
planning an entry into the general-purpose portal market. But
Schrock said it would be quite different from today's offerings
from Yahoo, Lycos, and others, with a greater emphasis on making it
fast and easy to find information.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Parr, Internet portal analyst for International Data Corp.
in Mountain View. Calif., says AltaVista's targeting an upscale
niche is a logical move. ``If you look at the options that were
available to them, this was probably the best one,'' said Parr. But
he noted that AltaVista has fallen far behind the better-known
portal sites and will find it difficult to play catch-up. ``They
are clearly a dark horse in this race,'' Parr said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, AltaVista may be worth billions to CMGI or some other
suitor. Schrock tiptoed around questions about Compaq's
negotiations with CMGI to sell all or part of AltaVista. But he
said negotiations were ``going hot and heavy.'' Schrock also noted
that CMGI's large stable of Internet businesses ``would make a
great set of services and additions, to make the AltaVista network
even more powerful going into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Compaq closed down 1/16 to 22 5/16 Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange. CMGI, based in Andover, Mass., shares rose 3
7/16 to 97 11/16 on Nasdaq.

<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Yasser Arafat, president of the
Palestinian Authority, has concentrated executive power so
completely in his own hands that he personally approves all senior
officials' vacations and their per diem expenses, an international
study released here Monday found.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has used government jobs to ease unemployment and to
reward political loyalty to such an extent, the report says, that
the public sector is bloated, inefficient and risks incurring
staggering debts to pay pensions.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Legislative Council is relatively impotent, the
judiciary is in disarray, unregulated monopolies rule many
industries, and the police force abuses its powers. Yet, compared
with the governments of many infant countries, the Palestinian
Authority, whose West Bank and Gaza territories are not even a
state, is managing openly and spending well the billions of dollars
in aid that it receives from international donors.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the conclusions presented here Monday by an
American-European panel sponsored by the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York and paid for by the European Commission and
the government of Norway. The panel, led by former Prime Minister
Michel Rocard of France, has spent a year evaluating Palestinian
public institutions with the cooperation of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the group, a high-powered assembly of former
European prime ministers and American legislators, is to present
its recommendations formally to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The committee leavened its critical findings with compassion for
the Palestinian Authority. It is not easy to evolve overnight from
a secretive authoritarian military organization in exile like the
Palestine Liberation Organization into a pluralistic government
whose financial records are accurate and open, Rocard said.
</P>
<P>
   In its five years of life, the authority has gone further down
the path toward building democratic institutions, securing public
order and delivering services to its rapidly growing population
than many comparable ``post-conflict'' governments, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have Africa in mind, please,'' Rocard said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian journalists at a news conference here said the
dynamic _ wrapping harsh assessments in praise _ reminded them of
this Arabic saying: After hitting someone over the head, you must
readjust his cap.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel, which will continue to function as a consultant
to the Palestinians, seemed determined to develop a critical-minded
partnership with the authority and to goad it toward secular
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   That reflects, in part, the international community's
determination to make sure that its $3.3 billion in assistance,
pledged for five years, is not spent on a government in training
that is corrupt, inefficient and abusive toward its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The report also underscores the fact that the Palestinians now
enjoy significant political good will around the world,
particularly from the Europeans, who consider the emerging
Palestinian society a pet project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five-year-old story of the Palestinian Authority is a
story of success,'' Terje Roed-Larsen, a special adviser to the
Norwegian foreign minister, said. ``Why? Because the Palestinian
Authority has built its institutions under extremely difficult
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Roed-Larsen referred to the many impasses in the peace
negotiations with Israel, which demanded that the Palestinians
build ``their new house'' while traveling on a bumpy road to
statehood. He noted that the Palestinians had been more closely
scrutinized than any other ``entity recipient of donor money on
this globe.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the committee's report suggested that it was a matter
of great urgency for the Palestinian Authority to ``acknowledge its
own shortcomings'' and change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to reform is not an option,'' Henry Siegman, the project
director and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations,
said. ``The World Bank and the IMF will participate in the next
phase, and they will be looking closely at the trend lines, at
whether there is movement toward reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended that the Palestinians carry out these
activities, among others:
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish a constitution, a move that Arafat has delayed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pare the president's office by delegating added authority to
the ministries and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grant greater power to the Legislative Council, which, the
report says, the president stifles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Abolish the secretive state security courts and provide more
support to an independent judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish more financial openness and accountability by, at
the least, presenting a detailed and timely budget to the
Legislature and disclosing public revenues.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bring the police force under clear civilian authority, and, as
the Israelis demand, reduce its size substantially.
</P>
<P>
   When Arafat learned of the criticisms in an informal meeting,
Siegman and others recounted, he suggested that he was being judged
too harshly. For instance, what the Americans and Europeans see as
a bloated payroll, he explained, he sees as a political management
tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us that if these people were not on the public
payroll, they'd be in the streets causing problems for him, and
then we'd be asking him to keep better control of the streets,''
Siegman said. ``He argued that we overstated everything, that he's
not running Monaco, and that he has people inside and outside who
want him to fail.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report, at least in the executive summary released Monday,
does not deeply examine two problems that the authority's critics
have considered paramount: financial corruption, which involves the
revenues that the authority collects, not international money, and
human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   One Palestinian official noted that the entire leadership of the
European Commission, which financed the committee, had stepped down
after accusations of cronyism and corruption had been made. ``So
what we are supposedly doing is perhaps not that remarkable,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, the Palestinians' planning and
international cooperation minister, Nabil Shaath, said, ``Questions
about human rights have already been dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   Open dissent is allowed in the West Bank and Gaza, Shaath said,
adding that at a new police academy, which five European donors are
financing, police are undergoing training in human rights and
interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   Shaath said Arafat declined to approve a constitution until the
Palestinians had their own state.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the extent of Arafat's authority, Shaath said the
issue was Arafat's tendency to micromanage rather than his abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning to delegate minor decisions is relevant for every
leader,'' he said. ``Our president works 18 hours a day, and he
doesn't feel the fatigue. Time management is not one of his big
issues. But we can bring it up with him.''

   Under the deal, ABC agreed to financial ``participation'' by
affiliates in the new soap opera channel. However, the network also
asserted broad rights to the ``repurposing'' on other channels of
its entertainment, sports and news programs.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, like other networks, pays its affiliate stations about $200
million per year in compensation fees to carry network programming.
A reversal of fortune began last year, though, when ABC agreed to
pay $550 million per year to retain the rights to ``Monday Night
Football.'' Almost immediately, the network started seeking help
from its 225 affiliates, many of which did not want to pay for
``Monday Night Football,'' especially since football audiences have
dropped in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But the affiliates' hand was weakened when CBS and Fox
affiliates agreed to help their networks with the cost of football
to the tune of roughly $50 million per year. Then in May, a
bombshell hit the TV industry when Fox affiliates agreed to pay the
network up to $60 million a year for advertising time they used to
get at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fox, ABC and CBS deals are taken together, ``This is a
fundamental realignment,'' said John Rash, director of broadcast
negotiations at Campbell Mithun Esty, a Minneapolis agency that
places millions of dollars worth of network ads each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a challenging era for affiliates,'' added
Rash. ``As the networks are under increasing cost pressures,
they're looking for new streams of revenue _ and their first look
is in their own backyard, with their affiliates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cella, senior vice president of the McCann-Erickson ad
agency in New York, said the ABC deal with the affiliate board
``shows that network television has become a very difficult
business, more of a bottom-line business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the networks are truly losing money, and the
affiliates are realizing it's got to be more of a partnership, for
the survival of the networks,'' he said.

BLAIR SETS WEDNESDAY DEADLINE FOR DEAL ON IRA DISARMAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Prime Ministers Tony Blair of
Britain and Bertie Ahern of Ireland failed Monday to persuade
Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders to end the dispute that
threatens to collapse the Northern Ireland peace effort: the
disarmament of the Irish Republican Army and the participation in a
new executive cabinet of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute threatens the next vital step envisioned in the 1998
peace agreement: the transfer of power from the British government
to the Northern Ireland Assembly. Protestants insist that the IRA
must start disarming before Sinn Fein is allowed to participate in
the new executive cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has set a deadline for the negotiations of midnight
Wednesday. If no agreement is reached by then, and the peace effort
begins to collapse, Blair has said there will be a return to
violence between the Protestant majority and the Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
   The two prime ministers spent the day urging a settlement on
party leaders, including David Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionist
Party and first minister of the assembly, and Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   But they did not get the opponents around a table face-to-face,
as had been expected. Neither Blair nor Ahern made any statement on
the day's work. The talks are to resume Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night BBC television showed an interview with President
Clinton, who urged compromise, and noted that if Protestants
allowed Sinn Fein into the cabinet, but disarmament guarantees
failed, the Protestants could walk out of the Assembly, rendering
it useless.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would consider ``personal intervention'' in the
impasse, Clinton said, ``Absolutely. I will do whatever I can to
help.'' Clinton's intervention last year helped win approval for
the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere around the talks, in the Stormont complex on the
edge of Belfast, was further complicated, if not soured, by a
decision of the government-appointed Parades Commission to forbid
Orange Order Protestants to march next Sunday through a Catholic
area of Portadown, west of here. Both Blair and Trimble left the
political talks Monday morning to try to work out a compromise on
the parade from Drumcree church along the Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants say they have a right to march as citizens in a
democracy. Catholics say the parade is insulting and triumphal. In
recent years the conflict over this parade has erupted in violence.
Northern Ireland is now waiting to see whether the ban would lead
to more violence this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, according to politicians and analysts, needed a
compromise on the parade that would permit the Protestant march.
His apparent strategy was to compromise on the disarmament issue,
making a concession to Sinn Fein, while showing that as a
Protestant and an Orangemen, he was able to get the parade
approved, something that has not happened since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Having failed on the parade, Trimble may find it more difficult
to accept a promise by Sinn Finn to disarm _ rather than actual
disarmament itself _ by May 2000, as stipulated in the 1998 peace
accord.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A shadow of violence disrupted the announcement of the Parades
Commission decision, at the Stormont Hotel, by its chairman
Alistair Graham. As Graham read a statement, alarm bells began to
clang, and he smiled slightly, looked puzzled, then annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a Protestant guerrilla had phoned in a bomb threat
and the hotel was evacuated. After no bomb was found, Graham
resumed his statement in a heavy rain in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   One of those in the audience was Steven McDonald, the often
honored New York City policeman who was shot in Central Park in
1986, and paralyzed from the neck down. He had just finished a talk
in the hotel on the need for reconciliation between Catholics and
Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we thought it was practical joke,'' he said of the alarm
bells. ``Then people began to run all over the place. I thought:
`I'm in trouble.'''
</P>
<P>
   But he was rushed out of the hotel in his wheelchair. He is to
address the Assembly on Tuesday on the need for forgiving enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 American tourists, some laughing, piled into their tour
bus and drove away from the hotel. A sign in the front window of
the bus said ``The Irish Experience.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. A fellow manager has made a ``hobby'' out of
trashing my reputation. She makes treacherous and untrue remarks to
anyone who will listen, and this is having a negative impact on my
ability to manage. I have gone to our boss, and his reply is
simply, ``Everyone knows her; just ignore her.'' What can you
suggest? M.A.
</P>
<P>
   A. The main reason why your fellow manager has not given up her
malicious ``hobby'' is that your boss has gone ostrich on the
entire matter. And further, his lack of action is actually
condoning her trashing tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ``everyone knows her'' indicates that she is a
real problem, while the fact that he is doing nothing about it
indicates that he is a real problem too.
</P>
<P>
   Although you have probably met with your abusive colleague, it
may be worthwhile to approach her again, in a more assertive mode.
Give her specific examples of the unacceptable comments, let her
know how upset you are, tell her that the behavior has to stop now,
and then indicate that you plan to take more serious action if it
persists.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you see an immediate improvement, you should have the
same assertive discussion with your manager, and let him know that
you will approach more senior levels of management if necessary. Be
sure that he understands how distressing you find this harassment
to be, adding that you hope the matter can be resolved within the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   If that does not pull his head out of the sand, you should take
the issue up to the next managerial level. Unless the entire
organization is out to lunch, there will be someone who understands
the potential costs and liability associated with your colleague's
``hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our boss keeps promoting his girlfriend even though she does
less work than the other employees in the department. What's worse,
we work in city government, where this sort of thing isn't supposed
to happen. What can we do? D.E.
</P>
<P>
   A. Promoting people strictly because they are girlfriends or
boyfriends is not supposed to happen in any organization, whether a
governmental agency or a car agency. It is nice to think that city
government is somehow insulated from such behavior, but it is not _
despite of the potential damage, disruption and liability.
</P>
<P>
   You and your fellow employees should first meet with your boss
and tell him that you sense some inequities in the promotion
process, and add that you are confused over the criteria that are
being used to determine promotions. He will most likely defend his
promotion decisions, and you should be willing to listen.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, you should emphasize your qualifications for
some of the positions that have been filled, ask him about
forthcoming advancement opportunities, and let him know that you
would like to be considered for them. The meeting should conclude
with all parties agreeing that merit, equity and experience are the
key factors that will determine promotions. The next step is to see
if he acts like a boyfriend or a manager.
</P>
<P>
   If he shows any kind of favoritism toward his girlfriend, you
should contact his manager or the human resources department. Your
boss is going to find that giving his girlfriend favorable
treatment is not regarded favorably by management.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have an employee in my department who is on more
committees, task forces and special projects than anyone I have
ever seen. The problem is that she is rarely around when I need
her, and her work is suffering. How do you work with someone like
this? B.D.
</P>
<P>
   A. When an employee's primary job responsibilities are playing a
secondary role, it is time to reset the priorities. In a word, you
should sit down with her and clarify the job responsibilities,
standards and expectations. If her performance is truly falling
short, it will be important to provide her with some feedback,
along with guidance and direction to help bring it back up to par.
</P>
<P>
   You should work out a plan to extricate her from some of the
present projects that are pulling her away from her departmental
responsibilities. You should also indicate that before she accepts
a future assignment beyond the department, she will need your
approval.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the managers who are using her for such
projects should be told that her level of participation is
interfering with departmental operations. If such managers would
like to have her on a committee or task force in the future, they
will have to obtain your approval first.
</P>
<P>
   It is often helpful and productive for employees to get involved
in activities beyond their core job responsibilities. However, when
the core gets bigger than the apple, it is time to cut it back.

ABC, AFFILIATES REACH $45M ACCORD ON `MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e, f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a further restructuring of the economic arrangement that has
governed television for 50 years, ABC has reached a deal with its
affiliate governing board under which affiliate stations would pay
a total of $45 million per year for ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   In return for the payments to the network, the affiliates would
receive a chunk of the revenues from a new cable soap opera channel
ABC has been developing, amid fierce opposition from affiliates
fearful it will steal viewers from them. Affiliates will also
receive eight additional prime-time commercial spots per week.
</P>
<P>
   But what raised eyebrows Monday was the affiliates' capitulation
to ABC's demand that they help defray football costs. If approved
as expected by individual ABC affiliates, the deal would further
tilt the rapidly changing playing field on which networks and
affiliates are now operating.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the networks have paid affiliates to carry their
programming, not the other way around. But financially strapped
networks, facing declining viewership and soaring programming
costs, have lately sought to reorder the relationship by pressuring
their cash-rich affiliates for financial help. It has gotten nasty
at times: Earlier this month, ABC reportedly sent a letter to its
affiliates threatening to yank ad time if they didn't agree to help
with football costs.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, however, the principals strove to present a harmonious
front. ABC Television Network president Patricia Fili-Krushel said
Monday that the deal with the affiliate board is ``mutually
beneficial,'' though she added pointedly that it ``reflects the
urgent need to change our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Scott, chairman of ABC Television Affiliates
Association, said he will recommend that affiliates accept it,
maintaining that it it ``underscores the mutuality of our interests
with the network and provides a framework of stability over the
next three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Cheng, director of programming and communications at
WCVB-TV, Channel 5, said the Boston station is ``very relieved that
an agreement has been reached.'' Cheng said station officials do
not yet know how much Channel 5 will have to pay for ``Monday Night
Football'' or how much the station will reap from the soap opera
channel. Channel 5 is the largest ABC affiliate in the country in
terms of market size.
</P>
<P>
   Giving affiliates a piece of the action from the soap opera
channel, slated to launch in January, may partly mollify ABC
affiliates, but is unlikely to fully satisfy them. Affiliates still
fear a loss of viewership during the daytime and prime time alike,
as soap fans realize they can catch their programs at night.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, ABC agreed to financial ``participation'' by
affiliates in the new soap opera channel. However, the network also
asserted broad rights to the ``repurposing'' on other channels of
its entertainment, sports and news programs.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, like other networks, pays its affiliate stations about $200
million per year in compensation fees to carry network programming.
A reversal of fortune began last year, though, when ABC agreed to
pay $550 million per year to retain the rights to ``Monday Night

</P>

to the tune of roughly $50 million per year. Then in May, a
bombshell hit the TV industry when Fox affiliates agreed to pay the
network up to $60 million a year for advertising time they used to
get at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fox, ABC and CBS deals are taken together, ``This is a

negotiations at Campbell Mithun Esty, a Minneapolis agency that
places millions of dollars worth of network ads each year.

they're looking for new streams of revenue _ and their first look
is in their own backyard, with their affiliates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cella, senior vice president of the McCann-Erickson ad
agency in New York, said the ABC deal with the affiliate board
``shows that network television has become a very difficult
business, more of a bottom-line business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the networks are truly losing money, and the
affiliates are realizing it's got to be more of a partnership, for
the survival of the networks,'' he said.

FIDELITY-LEHMAN PACT AIMED AT WEALTHY RETAIL INVESTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund firm, and
Lehman Bros., an icon of New York investment banking, announced a
strategic alliance Monday that will give Fidelity customers access
to products and expertise once reserved for Wall Street's clubby
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   In a partnership that reflects major shifts in the investment
world, Lehman will offer Lehman-managed stock and bond offerings,
sophisticated derivatives and other investing products, and
professional research on companies and industries to Fidelity
brokerage clients _ ordinary people who buy and sell stocks and
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The juiciest products _ lucrative initial public offerings and
other equity and bond issues _ will be available only to Fidelity's
wealthiest customers.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, for whom the arrangement ends a 149-year-old history of
selling stock and bond offerings exclusively to brokerages, pension
funds, and other institutional investors, will now be able to sell
its products to a much wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement replaces a similar alliance that Boston-based
Fidelity forged with Salomon Bros. two years ago. That partnership,
pioneering at the time, foundered as the high-powered investment
bank became part of Citigroup Inc. through a series of mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mazzarella, president of Fidelity Brokerage Services
Inc., and Joseph Gregory, head of Lehman's global equity unit, both
declined to predict how the alliance would boost revenue for each
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Fidelity-Lehman partnership underscores several aspects of
the democratization of investing.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it suggests that in a world where investors
increasingly want to do things themselves, especially in a bull
market, investors are becoming more sophisticated and seek access
to tools and products once reserved for professionals.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it shows how money management firms are
sifting through the masses to target the wealthiest _ and most
lucrative _ customers. Fidelity earns more than 80 percent of its
revenue from the wealthiest 20 percent of its clients. Against that
backdrop, the Lehman deal reflects Fidelity's ``strategic decision
to focus on the upper-crust investor,'' said Eric Kobren, publisher
of the Fidelity Insight newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Last but not least, the alliance demonstrates how the Internet
is forcing traditional money management firms to change fast. As
Web-based brokerages attract a flood of new business, their
old-line cousins are racing to develop Internet strategies allowing
cheap on-line trading.
</P>
<P>
   While Fidelity has had a successful Internet strategy for
several years, Lehman is a newcomer to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman's exposure to the ordinary, or retail, investor largely
ended in 1993, when it split from American Express Co.'s Shearson
Lehman retail brokerage unit. While the firm has 200 specialized
brokers who cater to high-net-worth individuals, the investment
bank sells to only institutional investors, and has had none of the
Internet trading capabilities or retail distribution channels
deemed critical to competition.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, privately held Fidelity has more than 2.7 million
on-line accounts at its retail brokerage unit, which caters to
ordinary investors who trade stocks and funds on line. Fidelity,
which oversees total assets of $820 billion, also has 3.8 million
traditional fund shareholder accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of changing times, more than 59,000 of the firm's
93,000 trades last month were executed via the Internet by
customers themselves. Nearly 78 percent of all stocks and mutual
funds Fidelity sells are sold over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While Fidelity competes with many Web-based brokerages by
offering other companies' research, it may gain an edge by being
able to provide stock and bond offerings. Competitor Charles Schwab
&AMP; Co., the nation's largest discount stock brokerage and a giant
purveyor of other firms' mutual funds, struck similar strategic
alliances with major investment banks in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In its partnership with Lehman, Fidelity sought to avoid pairing
up with a company whose retail distribution network could compete
with Fidelity's. Still, Fidelity is considering offering Lehman
products to its own institutional clients _ a move that takes it
onto Lehman's traditional turf.
</P>
<P>
   With its Fidelity deal, Lehman is hoping to underwrite more
public offerings, especially for technology and Internet companies,
by selling the offerings to a broader audience, according to
Raphael Soifer, an industry analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. In
a frenzied stock market where IPOs soar manyfold when issued, the
presence of a wider audience of buyers is likely to push prices
even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, which will begin offering the Lehman products in about
two months, will require that clients have at least $500,000 in
their Fidelity accounts to participate in IPOs or other offerings
lead-managed by Lehman. And customers will be prohibited from
taking quick profits by immediately selling shares of new companies
_ a practice known as flipping. For its part, Fidelity will share
in the fees generated by Lehman offerings, both for private firms
going public and for established companies issuing new stock or
debt.

 &HT;    UPS to announce acquisition of Challenge Air
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a move to strengthen its Latin American presence
and catch up with rivals, United Parcel Service signed deal to
acquire Miami-based Challenge Air Cargo Inc., the largest cargo
airline serving the region.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer of UPS,
said the proposed acquisition would speed the company's ability to
aggressively serve the Latin American market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Challenge Air has a flourishing air cargo business that will
supplement our package delivery system,'' Kelly told members of the
Rotary Club of Atlanta Monday.

   ``This move, in essence, will make us the largest air cargo and
package carrier company in Latin America,'' he said. ``Not to
mention, it will cut years off the process of acquiring operating
rights and landing rights to various Latin American countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The move also shows UPS' attempt to level the competition with
rival FDX Corp., which has an extensive operations in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the UPS-Challenge Air deal were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition includes all of Challenge Air's leased
facilities, ground equipment, computer systems, route authorities
and some staff.
</P>
<P>
   The company's fleet of aircraft is not included in the asset
list, said Bill Spohrer, president and founder of Challenge Air
Cargo. Challenge Air operates a fleet of three Boeing 757s and two
DC-10-40 freighters and will be adding a third in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   UPS has leased aircraft to Challenge Air for some time. Last
September, the two companies teamed up to provide expanded package
delivery service for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Challenge Air has aviation operating rights in 13 countries in
Latin America, making abut 120 flights per week.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said UPS viewed Latin American as an important market to
solidify the company's international expansion efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the company announced plans to acquire the assets
of Union Pak S.A. for an undisclosed price to establish its own
operations under the banner UPS de Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set our sights on the Latin American market after
strengthening our operations and capabilities in Europe and Asia,''
said Ron Wallas, president of UPS International.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said recently that his company has committed $500 million
in investments in Asia, including a logistics center in Singapore
used exclusively to ship goods for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The company has added seven additional flights per day to Asia
in recent months and plans to soon add a flight from Malaysia to
Singapore and Hong Kong to connect those
</P>
<P>
   major regional trading centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition (Challenge Air), once completed, makes us the
major player,'' Wallas said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS officials hope to close the Challenge Air deal by the start
of 2000.

SOME MEDICAL AID FOR KOSOVO MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, Project Hope, the American medical charity, shipped
$1.5 million worth of emergency supplies to the Kosovo refugees.
But relief workers desperate for syringes, penicillin and insulin
found many of the hundreds of boxes instead contained Chap Stick,
Preparation H and anti-smoking inhalers _ given by U.S. companies
that got a tax break for the donations.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of aid from corporate America and elsewhere for
the roughly 700,000 refugees that flooded Albania and Macedonia
during the war between NATO and Yugoslavia was indeed massive and
included many badly needed medicines. But the World Health
Organization said about a third to half of all of the shipments
were essentially useless and are likely to just gather dust in
warehouses or be destroyed at government expense.
</P>
<P>
   Some shipments contained medicine not suited to the needs of the
refugees or drugs that would expire before they could be given out,
according to the World Health Organization and some of the relief
agencies on the ground responsible for overseeing medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The problem arises, critics say, as there remain far too many
incentives for companies to empty out their warehouses, regardless
of need, and for charities to ferry the supplies along. What
particularly upsets the critics is the belief, especially prevalent
among American donors, that any gift is better than none.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment from Project Hope, the Milwood, Va., charity best
known for health education, for example, included lip balm,
hemorrhoid ointment and bottles of Robitussin cough syrup, courtesy
of American Home Products, according to an inventory of the items.
Other boxes contained Nicotrol anti-smoking inhalers and endless
varieties of Tylenol, including a children's fruit-flavored remedy
for sinus pain, all contributed by Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you from being in refugee situations in the last
eight years, refugees need Chap Stick, Preparation H and
Robitussin,'' said Jack Bode, the vice president of development and
communications for Project HOPE.
</P>
<P>
   Items like Chap Stick and Robitussin represent only a tiny
fraction of the nearly $5 million worth of shipments that Project
Hope said it is sending to Macedonia. Of that, most drugs are
either antibiotics or gastrointestinal drugs. The charity also said
that all of its donations were reviewed by the Ministry of Health
in Macedonia, which requested the items _ including the Nicotrol
inhalers for use in a pilot anti-smoking program.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the drug companies that make donations, American
Home and J&AMP;J spokesmen say they rely on the charity collecting the
donation to make sure the drugs are needed. In addition, American
Home's spokesman said the company has provided a ``significant
amount'' of penicillin to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the world of corporate giving, relief workers have
learned to take the good with the bad. Another recent shipment to
Macedonia contained drugs that expire within a few months,
according to a relief worker. While some of the drugs are exactly
what the doctor ordered, some were given in such tiny amounts as to
be virtually worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed bags like these are not unusual, according to some relief
workers who are responsible for dispensing donated drugs or, if
they cannot be used, destroying them. Despite the efforts of
governments and major relief agencies to oversee the quality of the
drugs, ``large quantities of donated medicines are not usable and
wasted,'' said Gilles Forte, a World Health Organization adviser in
Copenhagen, Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   While hard numbers are impossible to come by, Forte estimates
that as much as 30 percent to 50 percent of the drugs being sent
may be essentially worthless.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is expected to worsen as the refugees stream back
into Kosovo. With no central authority in place to provide much in
the way of oversight, relief workers say that they fear widespread
dumping, worse even than what they saw in Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is going to be the big one,'' predicted Sebastian
Fouquet, who has been heading the relief work in the region for
Pharmacists Without Borders, a French group that oversees the
delivery of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   If Fouquet is right, Kosovo will be only the latest area to be
besieged with inappropriate donations. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, for
example, possibly as much as half of the roughly 30,000 tons of
donated medical supplies were of little or no use, according to an
article that appeared in late 1997 in the New England Journal of
Medicine. The cost of destroying those drugs is estimated to be
upward of $30 million _ $2,000 per ton.
</P>
<P>
   Charities like Pharmacists Without Borders do not want these
useless donations, said Sophie Logez, who has been working for the
group in Macedonia. ``We worked in Bosnia for two years, and we
have spent a lot of money destroying drugs,'' she said. ``That is
what we want to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Bosnia, as well as examples of useless and
potentially harmful donations in Armenia, Sudan and Lithuania,
helped solidify support for the voluntary guidelines issued by the
World Health Organization and other agencies in 1996, which were
revised earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines generally call for donations to be based on what
is needed _ a list of priority drugs generated by the country, if
possible _ and given only with the consent of those distributing
the drugs. The guidelines also suggest that drugs have a shelf life
of at least one year. While expired drugs may still be effective
for a while, critics worry that outdated medicines add to the
confusion and look like an ungenerous way for drug companies to get
rid of medicines that they cannot sell.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that some groups are ignoring these standards.
When Heart to Heart International, a Kansas charity founded by a
doctor, was given a draft of the guidelines by the WHO just as they
were being formulated, it chose to ignore them, according to the
Community Development Medicinal Unit, a not-for-profit organization
in Calcutta, India, which said it contacted the charity about an
incoming shipment.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1996, what the charity claimed was $12 million worth of
drugs arrived. But the Calcutta unit said that it determined that
nearly all the drugs were nonessential. None of the medicine could
be used to treat its most pressing cases of leprosy and
tuberculosis, and some of the drugs were already past the
expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   Certain drugs ``are very, very hard to procure,'' said Barbi
Moore, the senior vice president of international programs for
Heart to Heart. She said that the group does not send drugs with a
shelf life of less than six months, although records of the
shipment indicate drugs were sent that expired in less time. The
donations were approved by the proper officials, she said, and she
noted that Heart to Heart has worked hard since then to improve its
system.
</P>
<P>
   Discarded drugs are a particular problem, as they are considered
chemical waste and their disposal is strictly regulated. In
Croatia, for example, the estimated 700 tons of medical waste,
including packaging and needles, donated during the war and
afterward is expected to cost roughly $3 million to destroy, and
the World Bank is considering helping to finance some of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, companies have every incentive to keep giving
and recipients have every incentive to take what comes. ``This is
not a single-cause problem,'' said Michael Reich, a professor at
the Harvard School of Public Health, who expects to publish a
detailed study of drug donations in late August.
</P>
<P>
   American companies, for instance, are eligible for twice the
normal tax deductions when they participate in a humanitarian
effort. They also are able to shed old or slow-moving products, and
save the cost of disposal. In some cases, companies may view
giveaways as a form of sampling that can introduce new markets to
their products.
</P>
<P>
   The charities, which are under intense pressure to prove to
their donors how much good they are doing, are also at the heart of
the problem. They serve as middlemen between the drug companies and
the hospitals and clinics receiving drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Some may be too eager to accept donations regardless of their
actual value, because the donations help inflate both the amount
they claim to be raising and the amount that they claim to be
spending on the needy. This, in turn, makes them look more
efficient than they are, by turning their overhead into a smaller
fraction of their revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Many recipients of the donations _ those small hospitals or
clinics _ are also reluctant to speak up. ``Donations, as a rule,
are not refused,'' explained one recipient who participated
anonymously in a recent survey conducted by the World Health
Organization. ``Health professionals believe that if they refuse to
receive some drugs, they get nothing in the future. Their stance
is: Be content with 5 to 10 percent of all that is offered.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who balk risk being cut off from future gifts. ``This is a
kind of dilemma for our units,'' said Sister Nympha Que, a Medical
Mission Sister in Malawi, one of the poorest nations in southern
Africa. ``If they say something to our donors, there is a fear that
the donations would stop.''
</P>
<P>
   No one seriously expects governments in every case to speak up
against the practice, either. Many rubber-stamp the shipments lest
they set off diplomatic waves and offend donors at a time when they
may be desperate for foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   And some companies turn the pressure up by insisting that
charities take unwanted donations as a condition for getting the
things they really need. A relief worker in Macedonia for CARE said
his group was offered what seemed like a package deal: baby food,
which was welcome, and infant formula, which was not.
</P>
<P>
   Most relief organizations see formula as undermining
breast-feeding and rightly worry about whether refugee camps or
poor regions have the proper sanitation to make sure bottles and
other supplies are sterile. The deal was refused.
</P>
<P>
   But even the critics say that most of the charities and
corporations work together in ways that clearly save lives. During
the current Kosovo refugee crisis, the Albania Ministry of Health
singled out a donation from Glaxo Wellcome, valued at more than $1
million, as including ``a good quantity of medicines with a very
good quality.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is also one solution to the problem, which
happens when some companies actually part with cold cash _ allowing
the relief agencies to buy whatever they need.

`HOT DOG': HITS THE SPOT
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are

(jw) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you don't mind forgetting everything you ever learned about
nutrition or digestion, then ``A Hot Dog Program'' should hit the
spot. Rick Sebak, whose ``Ice Cream Show'' must have clogged acres
of arteries, turns his attention Wednesday night to what he calls
America's favorite fast food as gobbled from carts and stands, at
counters and in diners, and to the gobblers who claim that their
towns boast the hottest dogs anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers must by now know all about Nathan's Famous, the 100
percent all-beef dogs in a special casing, and don't forget the
fries. As Sebak discovers, Nathan's continues to bring back happy
memories to generations of noshers, even if the annual World
Hot-Dog-Eating Championship the company stages in Coney Island
doesn't strike you as particularly appetizing. Anyhow, the record
is held by a little fellow from Japan who consumed 24.5 dogs on
buns in 12 minutes in 1997. You can catch the event this weekend at
the original Nathan's, 1310 Surf Avenue, at Stillwell Avenue in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Also in New York is a tribute to ethnic diversity (and at 75
cents a dog, recently raised from 50 cents, the biggest bargain in
Manhattan) served by Gray's Papaya at 2090 Broadway, at 72nd
Street. A few miles up Interstate 95, in Fairfield, Conn., you can
find dogs prepared by a graduate of the Culinary Institute of
America, who maintains those old-time standards by refusing to
serve diet drinks.
</P>
<P>
   And in Clifton, N.J., Rutt's Hut, where folks used to go to make
out in the parking lot, is still deep frying its dogs, known around
town as ``rippers'' and ``cremators.''
</P>
<P>
   Sebak also samples the goods in Atlanta, which boasts a peppy
ambiance and a special mustard. Then there are those big fat dogs
offered by the Cozy Drive-In in Springfield, Ohio; the 10-inch
stretch dogs at Pink's in Los Angeles, which started out on a
pushcart in 1939 and is decorated with pictures of actors; chili
dogs and slaw dogs in Georgia and South Carolina; a dog big enough
to accommodate six toppings for 99 cents in a slot-machine joint in
Las Vegas, and a natural reindeer dog, weather permitting, in
Anchorage, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is touted as the nation's hot-dog capital. But the
practice there, as in other locations, seems to be to load up the
basic merchandise with onions, relish, pickles, hot peppers, celery
salt and anything else the proprietor can think of. It sounds to
this New Yorker as if somebody is trying to hide something.

TWO SERB CLERGYMEN DENOUNCE MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRACANICA, Yugoslavia _ The head of the Serbian Orthodox Church
and the senior bishop of Kosovo joined Monday to denounced Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, saying that his policies are criminal
and are the root of the evil done in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference at the 14th-century Orthodox
monastery here, the head of the church, Patriarch Pavle, said if
Serbia could survive only through crime then it should not survive
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the only way to create a greater Serbia is by crime,''
Pavle said, ``then I do not accept that, and let that Serbia
disappear. And also if a lesser Serbia can only survive by crime,
let it also disappear. And if all the Serbs had to die and only I
remained and I could live only by crime, then I would not accept
that, it would be better to die.''
</P>
<P>
   The church delivered its most recent denunciation of Milosevic's
policies in Kosovo on the 10th anniversary of his famous speech in
Kosovo that set the course for a decade of conflict. The message
from the church follows a call two weeks ago by the Serbian
Orthodox Holy Synod for Milosevic to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Beside the patriarch Monday was Bishop Artemije, the most senior
representative of the church in Kosovo, who was even more pointed
in his criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are both aware, as God knows, how much evil has been done
in the course of the last year and especially in the last three
months,'' Artemije said. ``The great part of the guilt lies with
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Artemije also faulted separatist extremists of the Kosovo
Liberation Army for the violence, but he said the hatred and
revenge exacted by the Albanians was understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is not understandable is the suffering caused by the
undemocratic regime of Milosevic,'' the bishop said. ``The Orthodox
Church has called for the resignation of Milosevic, not because we
lost the war in Kosovo, but because we think the problem could have
been resolved peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter with a similar message was released Monday.
Customarily, such letters are passed on to parish priests who may
read them to their congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Both clergymen deplored the violence against the Kosovo
Albanians, as well as the violence against ethnic Serbs and the
Orthodox Church in Kosovo. They called for NATO to step up its
efforts to protect Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Four monasteries and churches have been desecrated or burned in
the last two weeks, since NATO security forces arrived. One priest
has been abducted and one in Pec has been threatened, Artemije
said.
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch was visiting Kosovo on one of the holiest days of
the year for Kosovo Serbs, the anniversary of the battle of Kosovo
Polje, when the Serbs were defeated by the Turks in 1389. Kosovo
Polje is considered sacred ground by the Serbs, who define the
defeat there as the beginning of their struggle to preserve
Christianity despite pressure to convert to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces were prepared for a rise in tension during the day
and British troops increased their presence on the streets of
Pristina, the capital. American troops announced a curfew in their
sector in eastern Kosovo, which they regard as one of the most
contentious areas because it has a higher proportion of ethnic
Serbs than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marines came under fire again on Sunday night, when they
investigated a burning house near Gnjilane. A gunman fired on the
patrol and ran off. One soldier was hit by concrete fragments from
the impact of the bullet, but otherwise there were no injuries, a
NATO spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, has
reached a tentative plea agreement with Webster Hubbell, political
and legal sources said Monday, in which Hubbell will plead guilty
to a felony charge of lying about the role he and Hillary Rodham
Clinton played in a questionable Arkansas land deal.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement should avert a trial scheduled for August
that was likely to have explored Mrs. Clinton's conduct as a lawyer
in the land deal, which federal regulators characterized as a sham
and which led to the collapse of a savings and loan institution.
Mrs. Clinton might even have been called as a witness in the trial,
which would have taken place at the same time she is expected to
begin her campaign for the U.S. Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although he will plead guilty to the felony charge as well as to
a misdemeanor charge in a separate tax evasion case, Hubbell is not
expected to cooperate with Starr in providing additional
information about either President Clinton or Mrs. Clinton, the
sources said. Nonetheless, the sources said that Starr will not
seek any additional jail time for Hubbell, who was released from
prison two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Hubbell is sentenced to jail depends on the judge in the
fraud and tax cases, U.S. District Court Judge James Robertson, who
will also decide whether to accept the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The two Hubbell cases were the last to be brought by Starr. The
last two cases prosecuted by his office, against Susan McDougal and
Julie Hiatt Steele, ended in hung juries. The Hubbell plea
agreement means that the independent counsel is effectively close
to the end of his five-year investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching the agreement, it appears Starr has finally relented
in his efforts to press Hubbell to produce information damaging to
the Clintons. One associate of Starr, not in the prosecutor's
office, said he believed the decision to dispose of the Hubbell
cases reflected Starr's eagerness to be done with the long and
difficult investigation of the Clintons and to close down the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Although his office is still investigating a few matters
involving the Clintons, the major task remaining is for Starr to
issue a report about his activities. Some of Starr's associates
have said that he is tentatively planning to issue a report that
could be highly critical of the Clintons' behavior, especially that
of Mrs. Clinton. Under the independent counsel law, Starr is
required to issue a report on his activities to the three-judge
panel that appointed him. But it is unclear under a 1994 amendment
as to how much he is allowed to criticize people who have not been
indicted, like the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's years-long pursuit of Hubbell, whom he had indicted
three times, had become for critics of Starr and the independent
counsel statute a prime example of prosecutorial over-reach.
Starr's supporters have said Hubbell was pursued so vigorously
because his case was an example of stonewalling by the Clintons'
associates.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law, enacted in the aftermath of
Watergate, expires at midnight Wednesday. Although Congress held
many hearings, there was in the end no interest in extending the
statute. Starr is not obliged to close down his office because of
the law's demise.
</P>
<P>
   But he has testified before Congress that he believes the law,
which was supposed to insulate high-profile prosecutions from
politics, has not worked because independent prosecutors invariably
are accused of being political by associates of the subjects of the
investigations. As a result, he too believed the law should lapse,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, a former chief justice of the state of Arkansas and
once the No. 3 official in the Clinton justice department, spent
nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges brought
by the independent counsel that he bilked his partners in the Rose
law firm of Little Rock, where he had once worked with Mrs.
Clinton. He is currently a research analyst at the National Center
on Institutions and Alternatives, a non-profit study group in
Alexandria, Va. He has been working on criminal justice issues,
according to a statement from the organization and in his recent
book, he said he was paid about $12,000 a year. As a convicted
felon, he can no longer practice law.
</P>
<P>
   The felony charge to which he is expected to plead guilty does
not involve the Whitewater land development but a lesser-known but
more complicated land deal in Arkansas known as Castle Grande.
Castle Grande was funded by Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan,
which was owned at the time by James B. and Susan McDougal, the
Clintons' partners in Whitewater. Federal regulators attributed
Madison Guaranty's eventual failure in part to its involvement in
the Castle Grande development.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Hubbell did not mention Mrs. Clinton by name
but refers more than 30 times to the ``1985-86 billing partner'' on
the Madison Guaranty account, a description of Mrs. Clinton's role
in the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Hubbell's concealment of the role
he and Mrs. Clinton played in the Castle Grande development
defrauded the federal government in two ways. Had the Rose law firm
disclosed its activities to federal regulators, the law firm would
probably have been prohibited from lucrative legal contracts with
the same federal agencies. Under the employment contract, the firm
was obliged to disclose what appeared to be a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Starr had charged, the concealment interfered with
the ability of the regulators to understand just how troubled an
institution Madison Guaranty was, delaying its shutdown, and
increasing the eventual cost to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had for a time denied any involvement. But when
long-missing billing records from the law firm were discovered in
the White House book room in January 1996, two years after they
were subpoenaed by Starr, Mrs. Clinton said she remembered having
done legal work on the development but knew it by a different name.
</P>
<P>
   The tax fraud indictment had accused Hubbell, his wife, Suzanna,
his accountant and lawyer of scheming in the last four years to
avoid paying taxes and penalties of more than $850,000. Under the
proposed plea agreement, all charges will be dropped against Mrs.
Hubbell and the two family advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had contended that much of the owed taxes stemmed
from money Hubbell had embezzled and from hundreds of thousands of
dollars in income from jobs referred to him by friends and
supporters of the president. The indictment said Hubbell did little
work for those jobs and suggested that they might have been
arranged to discourage him from cooperating with investigators.

BUSH'S FUND-RAISING TOTAL TO TOP $20 MILLION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``California is a garden of Eden, a paradise to
live in or see'' _ goes a Woody Guthrie song _ ``But believe it or
not, you won't find it so hot, if you ain't got the do re mi.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush will find California hot on his arrival
Tuesday because Golden State Republicans are expected to give his
presidential campaign more than $4 million during a three-day
swing.
</P>
<P>
   That will push Bush's fund-raising through June 30 to more than
$20 million, including $11.9 million from Texas. That total
fund-raising broke Republican Bob Dole's 1995, pre-primary year
record of $13.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insiders say that while breaking Dole's fund-raising record
is nice, the more significant factor on Bush's July federal
campaign finance report will be that he has more money in the bank
than Dole did at this point in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dole at the midyear of 1995 had just $6.6 million left in the
bank. Bush reported he had $6.7 million in the bank after 28 days
of fund-raising in March, and Bush's campaign insiders say there
will be a substantial improvement in the cash-on-hand figure that
will be filed next month with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign is still playing down his fund-raising total.
Communications Director Karen Hughes said only that the campaign
has raised ``substantially'' more money than its goal of $15.2
million for the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to be in a strong position. The strength and breadth
of the fund-raising is indicative that the governor's message is
resonating across the country,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be collecting his California campaign gold during
receptions in San Diego, Irvine, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San
Francisco, Palo Alto and Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also is expected to attend a private meeting with Hollywood
Democratic supporters at the home of Warner Bros. co-chairman Terry
Semel. Semel reportedly is upset with President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential
nomination, for blaming Hollywood for youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush also will use the trip to introduce himself to
California Hispanics. Bush made major inroads in appealing to
traditionally Democratic Texas Hispanics during his re-election bid
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Tuesday will visit the Plaza de Mexico exhibit at a
county fair in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Governor Bush has succeeded in Texas in attracting a
large number of Hispanic voters,'' Hughes said. ``Part of the
effort in California will be to reach out to Hispanic voters in
California as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the money Bush will rake in, he also received good news
in a June 16 Los Angeles Times poll that found Bush had the support
of 50 percent of California's Republicans, followed by Elizabeth
Dole at 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That same poll found Bush in a statistical dead heat with Gore
in a general election match-up with 49 percent for Bush and 44
percent for Gore. The Times noted that a tie for Bush in the poll
is a major success given that California Gov. Gray Davis, a
Democrat, won election last year by a 20-point margin.
</P>
<P>
   Less surprisingly, Bush's campaign announced that it has
obtained the support of all but one of the Texas House's 72
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That one, Rep. Charlie Howard of the Houston-area city of Sugar
Land, said he had declined to endorse Bush because he does not like
to make endorsements in Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Howard also said he was a friend of Gary Bauer, another
Republican presidential candidate who sought Howard's endorsement
in January. Howard said he turned Bauer down for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I've got a problem with the governor,'' Howard
said. ``He's been a great governor and he'll make a great
president.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by Bush said he was grateful for the support
of so many home-state Republicans who have helped him push an
agenda that placed public education as a top priority.

CONGO CEASE-FIRE TALKS RESUME, BRIEFLY
</HEADLINE>
  (jw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Negotiations to end the
11-month-old war in Congo inched forward Monday as foreign and
defense ministers of all the nations involved in the conflict met
in Zambia to discuss a draft text for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks, already days behind schedule, broke up within two
hours, apparently because Congo and one of its allies, Zimbabwe,
objected to parts of the document, which had been hammered out by
lower level officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only be optimistic,'' said an official involved in the
negotiations. ``It's the first time we have gotten this far.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, said there remained substantial points of
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   The document calls for a cease-fire within 24 hours of signing
by all parties, with soldiers staying in the positions they occupy
at the time. It would also immediately establish a joint military
commission of three senior military commanders from each of the
signing nations, military experts from the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity and a neutral chairman appointed as
monitor by the OAU.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimbabwe was apparently unhappy with this commission,
wanting the United Nations instead. And Congolese officials
apparently feel the document places the rebels on equal footing
with their government, which they object to.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are the first serious effort in months the try
to end a war that has ensnared more than a half-dozen African
countries, killed thousands of people and forced much of the
Congolese population to flee. Part of the difficulty in finding a
solution is that each of the warring factions has its own tangled
reasons for being there, and the rebels have split into -smaller
factions.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting broke out in Congo last July as rebel forces backed by
Rwanda and Uganda attacked the government of Laurent Kabila, who
had been in power less than 18 months. Kabila had toppled the
former ruler in Congo, then known as Zaire, with the help of Rwanda
and Uganda. But he then had a falling out with his allies, largely
over his unwillingness to crack down on the Hutu ``interahamwe''
militias. Those militias were responsible for the 1994 Rwandan
genocide and were still hiding out in eastern Congo and making
raids into Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   At first in last July's offensive, the rebels, who are seeking a
voice in a government they consider corrupt and useless, seemed to
be winning. Then Kabila managed to enlist the aid of Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe, which saved the capital, Kinshasa, from
falling.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the fighting has been sporadic. Most experts say the
rebels control the eastern third of Congo, a mineral-rich country
in Central Africa. They are threatening Mbuji Mayi, the southern
diamond-mining area that is the source of much of the government's
income.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by Zambia and South Africa to negotiate a solution have
failed. But the war is costly, especially for Angola, which has a
renewed civil war at home, and for Zimbabwe, which is in dire
financial straits. While Zimbabwe's generals and its president,
Robert Mugabe, are believed to have invested heavily in Congo and
personally have much at stake, Mugabe has been unable to rally any
popular support for the conflict at home.
</P>
<P>
   All this has not stopped both countries from sending in fresh
troops in the last week. Angola is said to have sent in 1,000 of
its best soldiers, and Zimbabwe, 3,000 soldiers. Monday, Congolese
officials accused Rwanda of deploying 7,000 fresh troops two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the ministers do ratify the document, the heads of state from
the six warring nations and leaders of the two main rebel factions
will be called to a meeting to sign a cease-fire. If they do not
ratify it, some experts believe that it could take a long time to
get any new momentum for peace talks. Kabila, in particular, is coy
about arriving at talks. Last week, his delegation claimed he was
having a bout of malaria; when talks went in his favor, the fever
cleared up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The draft agreement the ministers are looking at is vague in
crucial areas. It calls for the joint military commission to
``initiate and oversee the process of the orderly withdrawal of all
foreign troops.''
</P>
<P>
   It says the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity
will play a role as observers and ``may request neutral African
countries to contribute toward peacekeeping operations.''
</P>
<P>
   But ending the war and establishing a new government in Congo
would be a long process. The document calls for a ``national
dialogue'' in Congo to include the rebels, as well as political
organizations and ``civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   That dialogue will aim to create a new national army from
government and rebel forces and to work out a system of
power-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the security concerns of Rwanda and Uganda, a second
protocol resolves that all ``renegade forces'' in the region,
including the Hutu militias, be disarmed, sequestered and
documented. It urges the United Nations find a way to screen the
forces to arrest those responsible for the 1994 genocide against
Tutsi and moderate Hutu in Rwanda.

 &HT;    South's leaders urge cooperation in tech jobs hunt
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (f) Financial and (a) General news categories.)
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Leaders who are charting the South's future urged
state governments Monday to view one another as allies, not rivals,
in the competition for high-paying technology jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of the global economy are making us aware that we
better collaborate in this competition,'' said Pedro Rossello,
Puerto Rico's governor, who today becomes chairman of the Southern
Growth Policies Board.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a rush by states and cities to bolster recruiting of
technology companies and high-tech employees, the nonprofit board
advised regional cooperation to solve major problems that hamper
the South's overall economic development.
</P>
<P>
   The board, based in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park,
concludes its annual conference today in Charleston, W.Va. Created
in 1971, it devises development strategies for 14 states _
including Georgia _ and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials spoke to reporters Monday in a telephone
conference call from Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   In its newly adopted report, ``Southern Connections: Connecting
With Each Other, Connecting With the Future,'' the board said
fast-advancing technology threatens to worsen problems caused by a
lack of high-tech training for workers. Leaders who are ignorant
about technology's role in reshaping the global economy rapidly
need to get up to speed, according to the final report from the
board's Commission on the Future of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Especially vulnerable are poor, deteriorating communities with
few if any ties to the technology revolution, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   More so than ever, it's urgent that babies and children receive
adequate health care and day care, or risk entering schools so far
behind they'll wind up burdens on society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to recognize that work force development begins with a
pregnant mother,'' said former Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne Collins,
who chaired the commission. ``How well we treat our youngest
children will determine how competitive our future economy can
become.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    South's leaders urge cooperation in tech jobs hunt
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (f) Financial and (a) General news categories.)
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Leaders who are charting the South's future urged
state governments Monday to view one another as allies, not rivals,
in the competition for high-paying technology jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of the global economy are making us aware that we
better collaborate in this competition,'' said Pedro Rossello,
Puerto Rico's governor, who today becomes chairman of the Southern
Growth Policies Board.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a rush by states and cities to bolster recruiting of
technology companies and high-tech employees, the nonprofit board
advised regional cooperation to solve major problems that hamper
the South's overall economic development.
</P>
<P>
   The board, based in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park,
concludes its annual conference today in Charleston, W.Va. Created
in 1971, it devises development strategies for 14 states _
including Georgia _ and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials spoke to reporters Monday in a telephone
conference call from Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   In its newly adopted report, ``Southern Connections: Connecting
With Each Other, Connecting With the Future,'' the board said
fast-advancing technology threatens to worsen problems caused by a
lack of high-tech training for workers. Leaders who are ignorant
about technology's role in reshaping the global economy rapidly
need to get up to speed, according to the final report from the
board's Commission on the Future of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Especially vulnerable are poor, deteriorating communities with
few if any ties to the technology revolution, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   More so than ever, it's urgent that babies and children receive
adequate health care and day care, or risk entering schools so far
behind they'll wind up burdens on society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to recognize that work force development begins with a
pregnant mother,'' said former Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne Collins,
who chaired the commission. ``How well we treat our youngest
children will determine how competitive our future economy can
become.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission lauded the South, calling it a $1.9
trillion-a-year ``global economic powerhouse'' ranking as the
world's third-largest economy behind the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of improving the region's business climate and

COMMENTARY: THE SUPREME POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court term just ended showed us a phenomenon that
this country has not seen for more than 60 years: a band of radical
judicial activists determined to impose on the Constitution their
notion of a proper system of government.
</P>
<P>
   That was the import of three cases decided last week by
identical 5-to-4 majorities. The subject was ``federalism,'' which
sounds abstract. But the consequence of the decisions is far from
abstract. The five justices in the majority changed the structure
of American government. And they did so without a word of support
in the text of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   One case concerned patents, one of the few subjects on which the
Constitution gave absolute power to the federal government. The
purpose was to have a uniform patent system.
</P>
<P>
   The case before the court was a patent infringement suit by a
bank. It claimed that a board set up by the state of Florida was
wrongly using its patented method of enabling families to save for
college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1992 had passed a statute making clear that states,
when they ventured into commercial activities, could be sued for
patent infringement. But the 5-to-4 majority on the Supreme Court
held the statute unconstitutional. Florida could not be sued
without its consent, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The answer given by the five justices was ``sovereign
immunity.'' That concept was found before the American Revolution
in English law; it was said that the king could not be sued in his
own courts.
</P>
<P>
   The words ``sovereign immunity'' do not appear in the United
States Constitution. Without a basis in the text, the justices
picked out shards of doctrine to justify what was plainly a
preconceived conclusion. They said sovereign immunity assured a
state ``dignity'' and ``esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that a government is made undignified by being drawn
into court _ is humiliated _ seems grotesquely out of touch with
American ideals and contemporary realities. Americans expect
governments and their agents to defend their practices in court.
</P>
<P>
   Equally odd is the reliance on old English law. Those who wrote
a republican Constitution for America in 1787 did not exactly set
out to make the privileges of the crown part of their new system.
</P>
<P>
   A third curious aspect of the decisions is their notions of
sovereignty. A government might be immune from suits over the laws
it has itself made. But in these cases the laws were federal,
rooted in federal sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Thus federal law has set the rules for overtime pay since 1938.
But the five justices held that the state of Maine had sovereign
immunity from a suit by state employees for overtime pay they were
due under that federal law. The Labor Department could sue on their
behalf, Justice Anthony Kennedy said. But it does not have the
resources to enforce private rights. Justice David Souter,
dissenting, called the suggestion ``whimsy.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical implications of the cases are great. The court has
agreed to decide next term, for example, whether states are immune
from suits charging that they have violated the federal law against
age discrimination. Unless one of the five justices switches, the
answer will almost certainly be that the states can break that law
without fear of being sued.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Warren Court enlarged individual liberty under the
Constitution, conservatives have demanded that judges stick to the
text and the intention of its authors. After last week's judicial
rewriting of the very structure of our government, we should hear
no more conservative talk about original intention, strict
construction or judicial restraint.
</P>
<P>
   In the patent case, Chief Justice William Rehnquist conceded
that Congress had power under the 14th Amendment to provide
remedies for a deprivation of property _ a patent _ without due
process of law. But Congress, he said, had not had a good reason
for bringing states under the patent laws. That amounted to the
court passing on the wisdom of the law: the besetting sin of the
headstrong conservatives on the Supreme Court of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936 that court struck down a New Deal law designed to help
desperate farmers in the Depression. Justice Harlan F. Stone,
dissenting, said the majority opinion rang of ``the mind accustomed
to believe that it is the business of courts to sit in judgment on
the wisdom of legislative action.'' He added: ``Language, even of a
Constitution, may mean what it says.''

 &HT;    Glass ceiling still seen as a barrier
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Women and minorities continue to face barriers in
their advancement in the workplace, according to a survey of human
resources professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly nine out of 10 of the human resources managers who
responded to a Society for Human Resources Management poll said
they believed women face a glass ceiling and more than seven out of
10 said minorities face similar obstacles. Nearly 400 human
resources managers participated in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The Barriers to Advancement survey was one of three major
studies released at the group's annual gathering this week in
Atlanta. More than 13,000 people are attending the conference,
which runs through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of this survey indicate that employers need to
continue to focus on workplace diversity,'' said Sue Meisinger,
senior vice president at SHERM. Getting support from the heads of
corporations as well as concerted efforts to hire and retain women
and minorities were among the top suggestions for eliminating the
glass ceiling, respondents said.

QUAYLE PUSHES FAMILY VALUES IN URGING OVERHAUL OF TAX CODE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican presidential candidate Dan Quayle,
bemoaning the decline of the American family, said Monday he would
push for an overhaul of the tax code so one parent could stay home
with the children.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, returning to the family values theme that became a
``Murphy Brown'' punch line during his vice presidency seven years
ago, assailed ``anti-family'' tax laws for compounding parents'
financial hardship and compelling them to spend more time at work
than at home. As a result, he said, children are learning right and
wrong from television and other nefarious influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``My priority in this presidential campaign is to strengthen the
American family,'' Quayle said in a speech at the American
Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can provide the best education in the world, but only if
parents remember they are the most important teachers of all,'' he
added. ``We can control crime, but only if our sons and daughters
understand their responsibilities, and their own worth, as children
of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, whose campaign is stuck well behind those of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole and Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
took a subtle swipe at Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   The former vice president, who served in the administration of
Bush's father, expressed outrage at the scorn mothers who choose to
stay at home face from professionals who erroneously regard caring
for children around the clock as less demanding than most career
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every mother is a working mother,'' Quayle said. ``The term
`working mother' is redundant, sort of like `compassionate
conservative.'''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle lags not only in poll numbers, but in fund raising, as
social-conservative contributors are splitting their donations
among several like-minded candidates and Bush rakes in millions
each week.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle practically begged for donations Monday, telling the
crowd and a potential television audience that they could use a
credit card to contribute $21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Join the 21st Century Club. That's only $21!'' he said,
sounding like a zealous ad pitchman on TV. ``Just give us $21 and
get put on a fancy mailing list. You'll be supporting us and then
we'll be well on our way to victory!''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also criticized Democratic Vice President Al Gore, the
likely Democratic presidential nominee who campaigns on the need
for more federal involvement in day-care and after-school
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``These proposals do help many families,'' Quayle conceded.
``But they do nothing to bring parents and children together, which
is what parents want and need.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, Quayle said he would repeal the tax code's
``marriage penalty,'' which taxes married couples at a higher rate
than single individuals. Quayle also said he would allow
stay-at-home parents to enjoy the same day-care tax break as
employees do at some companies.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would strive to put hourly workers on equal
footing with salaried professionals, who generally have more
control over their working hours. Workers who punch time clocks
should have the option of receiving ``time and a half off'' rather
than overtime pay, Quayle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible for invisible parents to instill values in
their children,'' he added. ``We need to give working parents more
freedom and choices when it comes to raising their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his 1992 attack on television's ``Murphy Brown'' and its
positive depiction of single motherhood, Quayle said Monday he has
great respect for single mothers, particularly those who must raise
their children alone and who can ill afford it _ unlike the wealthy
Murphy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Many single mothers must work full time while ``trying to juggle
the responsibilities, the worries and the stresses'' of rearing
children by themselves, Quayle said. ``It's not that way in
Hollywood, but it's the real world for the single mom,'' he added.

GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS FOR RODHAM CLINTON IN HUBBELL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Webster Hubbell's guilty plea Monday makes life a
little easier for Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It means she won't have to trudge back to Arkansas this summer
and testify at what could have been a raucous trial, reviving
suspicions of her role in financial scandal, just as her campaign
for the US Senate was getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad break for the Republicans,'' Hank Sheinkopf, a
Democratic consultant, said Monday. ``Hillary ought to send Hubbell
a present.''
</P>
<P>
   However, New York politicians have mixed opinions on what would
happen if Mrs. Clinton is indicted or named as an ``unindicted
co-conspirator'' in special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Some think she could be hurt. Others, including some
Republicans, think she might be helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could conceive of a backlash, especially if you had some
right-wing Republicans piling on, saying it proves she shouldn't
hold office,'' said Joseph Mercurio, a local Republican consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have some effect against her, too,'' he added, ``but
I think it would mostly reinforce people who are already against
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollster John Zogby agreed: ``A Republican candidate, I would
think, drops this issue like a hot potato. What you don't want to
do is dredge up something that might backfire. And in New York,
being heavyhanded could backfire. It would make people remember
Newt Gingrich and the Republican Congress, which were never popular
in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a well-placed New York Republican, who asked not to be
identified, said revival of scandal could have consequences. ``This
isn't like Monica Lewinsky and sex,'' the Republican said. ``If she
was involved in a felonious financial transaction, that's quite
different. It's an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheinkopf, who supports Mrs. Clinton but does not work for her
campaign, agreed. ``If she comes up in the indictment, whether
she's indicted or not, the press will restate the charges against
her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for backlash, he said, ``Maybe now it would be backlash, but
15 months from now it will be another fact on TV in a negative
commercial. After she's been a candidate for months, and she's
ripped up her opponent and her opponent's ripped up her, she loses
her immunity from backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Mercurio, the Republican, doubts this scenario.
``Obviously, it depends what's in the report,'' he said, ``but New
Yorkers have elected indicted people before. Unless you did
something really bad, just being mentioned in an indictment _ I
don't think that would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zogby agreed: ``The question of whether a Republican candidate
in New York wants to be associated, in any way, with Ken Starr _ I
don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say Clinton faces easy times.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby's latest poll, released Monday, shows her trailing Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, her likely Republican opponent, by 10 percentage
points: 50 to 40.
</P>
<P>
   Other surveys of recent weeks offer a more upbeat picture for
Mrs. Clinton. The Quinnipiac College Polling Institute puts her
ahead of the mayor, 48-42. The Marist College Institute for Public
Polling shows the two running neck and neck, with Mrs. Clinton
ahead by 44-43 percent. All the polls have a margin of error of 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby said Monday that his poll surveys ``likely voters,'' while
the others look at ``registered voters.'' The question becomes: Did
Zogby guess right about who will vote?
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, Hispanics, and New York City residents, groups that
favor Mrs. Clinton by large margins, tend to vote in smaller
percentages than whites and upstate or suburban residents, who
favor Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton's hard-core backers turn out in much larger
numbers than usual, the results would be different.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby claimed his new poll includes a somewhat larger share of
urban and minority residents than usual. The question remains: Is
it large enough?
</P>
<P>
   The election, though still 16 months away, shifts into gear next
week, when Mrs. Clinton travels upstate with the retiring
Democratic senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and then tools through
the area for three days, giving speeches and holding informal
conversations.

A BIT OF NATIONAL DEBT MAY BE BETTER THAN NO DEBT ALL, EXPERTS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BUDGET-CLINTON, BUDGET-ASSESS) 
 (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton raised the mind-bending
possibility Monday that the giant national debt clock in midtown
Manhattan will soon start running in reverse _ and that by the year
2015, the government will owe no money to investors around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that Clinton described the general
direction of the clock correctly: Barring a stock market disaster
or a Japan-like recession, the United States' $5.6 trillion in
debt, the figure on the clock, will begin diminishing in the next
few months. That number includes debt that the federal government
owes to itself.
</P>
<P>
   The more important figure _ debt that the government owes
individual investors, companies and governments around the world _
has actually been in decline for the last two years. How much it
can be reduced in 15 years is a far more problematic calculation,
dependent on a huge range of economic assumptions _ chiefly the
growth rate of the national economy _ that, given the inexact
nature of such things, are most likely subject to major revision.
</P>
<P>
   But even if this country could pay off all its debts in the next
15 years, many economists and some government officials say it
might not be as great an idea as it sounds. While huge debts in the
1980s and early 1990s were a tremendous drag on the economy, just a
bit of national debt may be a very good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost hard to imagine what this country would be like
debt-free,'' said Alan Sinai, the chief economist of Primark
Decision Systems, an economic consulting group. ``But while no
politician would want to admit it, the optimal debt for the United
States is probably not zero. What that optimal level should be,
though _ now that's a subject for a real national debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, reducing the debt dramatically creates a host
of advantages for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. Treasury tames its appetite for borrowed money, it
no longer competes with homeowners looking for a mortgage, or
credit-card holders borrowing for their purchases. As a result,
interest rates have more room to fall. Anyone who borrows money
would gain.
</P>
<P>
   But that is only the beginning of the advantages. As the debt
declines _ Clinton's projections show that it will fall below $3
trillion in 2005, and below $2 trillion in 2009 _ the amount of
interest the government is forced to pay out each year goes down
substantially. That frees up even more cash, while raising the
national savings rate. And that, in turn, helps to compensate for
the free-spending ways of American consumers, who in these boom
times are barely saving.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way that you can look at this is as a tool to promote
national savings,'' one of Clinton's senior economic advisers said
Monday. ``That may be the biggest single advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the good news. A debt-free United States, however, might
create a more complex, and some say a riskier, financial landscape
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   For investors around the world, there is no safer place to put
money than in U.S. Treasury bonds. When the Asian economic crisis
hit in 1997, and accelerated last year after the collapse of the
Russian economy, investors around the world put their assets into
Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   These investments help make the dollar the world's most popular
``reserve currency,'' the money other governments hold for economic
security in their central banks. And they give the United States a
subtle but significant economic clout around the world.
</P>
<P>
   If the government stops long-term borrowing, that money stay in
the United States, invested, say, in mortgages or in corporate
debt. But if investors do not have the security of investing in
U.S. Treasuries, they may be less interested in holding their cash
in dollars. That, in turn, can affect the dollar's value on world
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, investors could put their money in another
country's treasury bonds _ say those issued by the new European
Central Bank or the Bank of Japan. But that requires taking a bet
on the future of European and Japanese currencies, adding a
significant risk to the investment.
</P>
<P>
   But is any of this likely to happen?
</P>
<P>
   That depends on a series of assumptions. The chief one is about
the future of the American economy. Clinton's projections, released
Monday, assume that the American economy will grow between 2.1
percent and 2.6 percent a year for the next 15 years. It made
similar bets for the past seven years, it was wrong every time. But
the surprise was pleasant: The economy expanded far faster, and for
far longer, than even the most optimistic government projections.
</P>
<P>
   The risk, of course, is that the next errors could be in the
opposite direction. That is exactly what happened to Japan, which
blithely assumed that the successes of the 1980s would extend into
the 1990s. It was the blunder of the decade, and the country now is
mounting up a huge debt as it tries to spend its way out of a
seven-year-long recession. Along the way it has busted every
estimate of how the country would save to pay for a quickly-aging
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are difficult projections to make for even the next year
or two,'' Sinai said Monday, ``and even more difficult for beyond
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And that risk is accentuated by the fact that most of the
paydown of the debt is scheduled to occur between 2010 and 2015,
allowing plenty of time for economic and political miscalculation
or happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the government is closer to paying off the
debts that really matter than even Clinton indicated Monday. While
the debt clock reads $5.6 trillion, the figure that kicks around
the U.S. Treasury is less than half that: $2.77 trillion. That is
the total U.S. debt that is held by entities other than the U.S.
government itself, its Federal Reserve banks, or state and local
governments. And under the president's projections, it will be paid
off around 2011.

 &HT;    Busy Hartsfield suffers day of delays
 &HT;    By Gary Hendricks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rain, a balky computer, one airliner with blown tires
and another that needed help getting aligned on the runway combined
to make air travel a miserable experience Monday at Hartsfield
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Flight delays ranging from 30 minutes to three hours snarled
travel plans for thousands of passengers at an airport that sees
2,300 landings and takeoffs on an average day. Airlines expected to
get back to normal schedules by late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad day, because you normally have delays when the
weather is bad,'' said Miguel Southwell, marketing director for
Hartsfield. ``But today it was compounded by other things.
Hopefully, we'll have a better day (today).''
</P>
<P>
   A major problem occurred at 10 a.m. when a hard drive failed on
the computer that supplies information to Federal Aviation
Administration radar screens at the Air Route Traffic Control
Center in Hampton, Ga. The problem was solved at 12:30 p.m., FAA
spokeswoman Tanya Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   Radar contact was never lost because a backup system kicked in,
but the FAA intentionally slowed traffic at Hartsfield as a
precaution. That set off a ripple effect of delays into Monday
night, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, technicians working on the same computer system
inadvertently disabled it, resulting in delays.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with aircraft closed two runways Monday. The closings
and rainy weather slowed traffic further.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Flight 804, with 105 people aboard, blew a nose gear
tire on takeoff for New York at about 8:15 a.m., said airline
spokeswoman Cara Maruskin. The pilot returned but did not declare
an emergency, she added.
</P>
<P>
   A second nose gear tire blew on landing. Passengers were
shuttled on a large tram to the terminal from the stranded plane. A
runway was closed for about 45 minutes, Maruskin said. The
passengers were put on later flights by AirTran and other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, a second runway was closed for 15 to 20
minutes after Delta Air Lines Flight 55 failed to make a turn and
needed help to get onto the runway properly, Delta spokesman Clay
McConnell said. A crew was sent to adjust the turning gear and got
the 184 passengers and crew on their way to Tokyo about half and
hour late, McConnell said.

TROUBLED TIMES FOR CHIRAC'S PARTY
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ President Jacques Chirac has an electoral lease on
Elysee Palace until 2002, but some people are wondering whether the
political party he founded to get himself to the presidency will
last that long.
</P>
<P>
   The latest blow to Chirac's Rally for the Republic was the news
Monday that his successor as mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, had been
formally placed under investigation in a criminal case alleging
kickbacks to the party from municipal contractors from 1991 to
1994. The case involves billions of dollars' worth of work in
low-income city housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Tiberi himself told the daily Le Monde that he had been charged.
But he described the move as incomprehensible, though a special
prosecutor has been investigating municipal corruption here for the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends know very well that I have nothing to do with what
I am being charged with,'' he said. Asked whether the prosecutor's
real target might be Chirac _ who was mayor when the kickbacks
allegedly were made but has immunity from criminal prosecution as
long as he is president _ Tiberi said people were free to draw
their own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The charge by Judge Eric Halphen, one step short of formal
indictment, was only the latest in a steady stream of corruption
accusations that have swirled around the Rally for the Republic,
which for 22 years has held power in Paris' city hall. Tiberi has
been unbowed by previous criminal investigations, including one
involving a city contract held by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But the newest revelation came at a delicate moment, just after
Tiberi let it be known, to the dismay of some members of his party,
that he would run for another term as mayor in 2001. The municipal
elections are already seen as the first round in Chirac's own bid
for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Rally for the Republic has been in chaos since Chirac decided
two years ago to dissolve Parliament in hopes of giving his
longtime favorite and right-hand man, Alain Juppe, then prime
minister, a bigger majority in the legislature. Instead the
elections put Lionel Jospin, a Socialist, in the prime minister's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The political cohabitation of Chirac and his Socialist opponents
has worked smoothly, but left the Rally for the Republic mired in
personal rivalries. Its third leader in two years, Nicolas Sarkozy,
quit this month after the party came in third, behind the
Socialists and even behind a new rightist party led by former
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, in elections for the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Sarkozy's slate got 12.8 percent of the vote, compared with 13
for Pasqua's. The Pasqua slate had been formed to challenge Chirac
for the right to the nationalist legacy left by Charles de Gaulle,
whose political heir Chirac has always claimed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac was off in Rio de Janeiro Monday, making a Gaullist
challenge to American domination of the Western Hemisphere in a
European Union summit with South American leaders.
</P>
<P>
   After the European Parliament election on June 13, he tried to
persuade Juppe, now the mayor of Bordeaux, to come back and lead
the Rally for the Republic again. Juppe turned him down, citing the
poisoned atmosphere. Halphen's investigation of party financing has
also focused on Juppe, who has disputed all charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Seguin, who resigned in April after a political spat
with Chirac, said on French television Sunday night that the
president's office had been weakened by cohabitation. France, he
said, might do better with a more American-style system of
government, doing away with the office of prime minister and giving
the president a term of five years instead of seven.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, the Socialist prime minister, ran against Chirac for the
presidency in 1995 and is widely thought to be preparing to
challenge him again in 2002 _ particularly if a Socialist can oust
Tiberi from Paris city hall a year before that.
</P>
<P>
   A public opinion poll published on Saturday in the weekly
magazine supplement of Le Figaro, a daily that supports Chirac and
his party, showed that Socialist Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, who is widely supposed to be the probable Socialist
candidate, would win 56 percent of the popular vote in municipal
elections, compared with 35 percent for Tiberi.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the agony that Chirac's party is going through, the
extreme right National Front of Jean-Marie Le Pen took an even
worse beating in the European Parliament elections. Actually, two
National Fronts did _ the party bitterly split late last year and
Le Pen's deputy, Bruno Megret, led a separate ticket on June 13
called National Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen's party got only 5.7 percent of the vote, and Megret's
took less than 3.3 percent. Their combined total, less than 9
percent, was down from the 10.5 percent for the undivided National
Front in the last European elections in 1994. When he ran for
president in 1995, Le Pen won 15 percent of the vote, on a platform
promising to reclaim French sovereignty lost to European
unification, and to reduce unemployment by throwing out millions of
immigrants from Africa.

CLINTON PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN WOULD COVER MOST ON MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consensus is building in Washington for adding a prescription
drug benefit to Medicare. Now the question is: for whom?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, whose proposal is expected Tuesday, is opting
for a plan that would benefit the broadest number _ all 39 million
elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries, or at least those who
pay an extra $50 a month or so for help with their ballooning
pharmacy bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, sensing the need to have a viable alternative
of their own, are expected to focus narrowly on low-income elders.
</P>
<P>
   If something like the Clinton plan prevails, Medicare will
remain what it started out to be 35 years ago _ a social insurance
plan with a constituency bigger than any government program except
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Republicans work their will, Medicare will become
more like Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor, in
which benefits depend on beneficiaries' income.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting his party's disdain for a broad-based prescription
drug benefit, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, a Texas
Republican, Monday expressed skepticism about how Clinton
``simultaneously plans to give prescription drugs to every senior
while keeping Medicare from going bankrupt and keeping premiums
from growing out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Medicare program that apportioned benefits according to
beneficiaries' income ``would not be Medicare anymore,'' commented
Judy Waxman, policy director for Families USA, a Washington-based
advocacy group. ``That would be a very different animal with very
different political support.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Clinton's plan is expected to be a significant step
closer to a means-tested Medicare plan. He reportedly will propose
a government subsidy to help pay the new monthly pharmacy benefit
premiums for elders with incomes below 120 to 135 percent of the
federal poverty level ($9,662 to $10,870).
</P>
<P>
   The main difference between the Democratic and Republican
approaches is that Clinton's proposal will include all Medicare
beneficiaries in the benefits _ and Clinton hopes to generate
premium income from all but the poorest to help fund the program.
That's the definition of social insurance, as opposed to a
government handout for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to elders, the gap between ``officially'' poor and
impoverishment by high pharmacy bills is increasingly narrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average Medicare beneficiary has an income of $15,000,''
noted Bruce Vladek, who ran the Medicare program in the early 1990s
and is now director of the Institute for Medicare Practice at Mount
Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people with that kind of income have a monthly pharmacy
bill of $200, that's a problem,'' Vladek said. ``I have real
trouble thinking you could do something serious and significant
about prescription drug coverage and leave out people with incomes
under something like $20,000.''
</P>
<P>
   While liberals applaud Clinton's inclusive approach, many still
worry about the tradeoffs being made behind closed doors as Clinton
and his aides craft the Medicare drug proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our great concern is that we protect the vulnerable
populations first _ those who really need this coverage as a
medical benefit, as opposed to an economic benefit,'' said Steven
Soumerai of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, who has studied the effect
of drug coverage on patients' health. ``We have to be careful this
isn't a hugely expensive program that doesn't really help those
with severe needs.''
</P>
<P>
   A key question, Soumerai said, is whether the Clinton plan would
subsidize not only the drug-coverage premiums of low-income
beneficiaries, but also their out-of-pocket costs.
</P>
<P>
   If the White House proposes to subsidize only premiums, that
will sharply undercut the new benefit for many, since the Clinton
plan reportedly will require beneficiaries to pay substantial
copayments _ perhaps up to 50 percent _ for each prescription. The
average Medicare beneficiary fills at least 18.5 prescriptions a
year, each one of which can cost $30 to $200 at retail.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 50 percent copay would be a hefty burden for poor elders,''
Waxman said. ``But it would be some help.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether such a program would really provide a meaningful medical
benefit is a big question. Studies to date show that the poor are
easily deterred from buying prescription drugs if they have to pay
more than a very nominal copayment.
</P>
<P>
   When the province of Quebec raised pharmacy copayments for poor
individuals, elders, and the mentally ill in 1996, from a maximum
of $100 a year to $750, researchers there found a steep increase in
their rates of illness and hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the result of raising people's out-of-pocket costs, people
reduced their drug use and they got into trouble,'' said Robin
Tamblyn of McGill University in Montreal. ``The biggest effect was
among the welfare group, who doubled their number of
hospitalizations and tripled their number of emergency room visits.
For elders using drugs for five or six diseases, we saw similar
effects. The hardest hit were the mentally ill; their
hospitalizations tripled and their emergency room visits increased
five-fold.''

 &HT;    Hawks try to move up for guard
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Hawks have set moving up in Wednesday's
draft as their top priority so they can take a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   If they are successful, they might open next season in Philips
Arena with a rookie running the show.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Pete Babcock would not confirm his
organization's intention, but he said during a Monday afternoon
briefing that the Hawks probably would have to trade one of their
key players in order to advance into the lottery and dip into the
pool of good point guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that you're never able to trade two or three
mediocre players for a star player. It doesn't work that way.
That's why you can't trade two or more mediocre picks to get a
really good one,'' Babcock said. ``You have to trade a star
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Since being eliminated in a second-round sweep by the New York
Knicks, the Hawks have said they would trade any player on their
roster, if they can improve. In reality, center Dikembe Mutombo is
the only player exempt from a potential purge because it would be
difficult for the team to improve without a top defensive center.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, veteran point guard Mookie Blaylock has been
targeted, because of the Hawks' stodgy offense and because he
shoots often but not well.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, coach Lenny Wilkens said that Blaylock no
longer owned the position he has occupied as a starter for the past
seven years. Wilkens said it remained to be seen whether Blaylock,
if he remains on the roster, could help the Hawks best by playing
off the bench. With three years remaining on his contract, Blaylock
might be a desirable property for a team that needs a tough
defender. Blaylock gets $4.2 million next season, $4.8 in 2000-01
and $5.4 million in 2001-02.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thinks that he could deal for one of the top five
picks, Babcock said, no. ``That would be very, very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Hawks know they can get a solid young point guard in
trading to the lottery level.
</P>
<P>
   The draft has seven promising points. Some _ Steve Francis of
Maryland, Baron Davis of UCLA and Andre Miller of Utah _ probably
will start next season. They are projected to be among the first
six or seven players taken Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Jason Terry, Fresno State's Chris Herren, Vonteego
Cummings of Pittsburgh and William Avery of Duke are good enough to
play significant minutes next season. Although Herren is closer to
being a pure point, all four can score, so they fall into a
category of need for the Hawks. Acquiring a combination guard is a
priority, Babcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have picks 17, 20, 21 and 27 in the draft. Curiously,
the keenest interest appeared to be in the last of the picks,
Babcock said, ``because teams have a sense that it's a pick we
would be willing to give up.'' It is likely No. 27 will be dealt
for a first-rounder two or more years from now, easing the
potential glut of young players on a roster that includes eight
returnees, plus free agents Grant Long and Chris Crawford who will
be welcomed back.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go for a point does not put the need for a
backup center on the back burner. The Hawks still can take a center
with one of their other selections.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock cautioned that any deals reached by Wednesday might not
be completed until August, because the league won't allow contracts
to be signed before Aug. 1, when the new salary cap goes into
effect. The amount of the cap is estimated to be $34 million. If a
team wants to trade a draft pick, it will not sign him, because
rules prohibit moving a newly signed player for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Although all first-rounders must be tendered contracts within 30
days, there are a couple of tip-offs to a deal: A drafted player is
not invited to a news conference Thursday or Friday; a drafted
player does not show up at summer camp; or a contract is tendered
but not signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be difficult keeping anything quiet,'' Babcock
conceded. But the first move is to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll know a lot more (today),'' he said. ``There's a lot of
talk, a feeling-out process. But Tuesday, so close to the draft,
that's when you either confirm real interest or move on.''

THE `99 GOLD RUSH _ SPEND THE SURPLUS OR `BUST'  
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis   
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has all the earmarks of the California gold rush
of 1849. Jockeying for position. Claims and counterclaims.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the budget-surplus rush of 1999 instead. With the
nation's capital awash in cash, both President Clinton and
congressional Republicans are scampering to spend the federal
government's extra funds _ or give them back in the form of tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Monday that thanks to the hard-charging
economy, the expected surplus for the current fiscal year has
swelled 25 percent beyond what the administration projected in
February. The figure then was $79 billion; now it's $99 billion.
Much of the increase is due to the 4.3 percent growth in the
nation's output of goods and services in the first three months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus is ``more red meat thrown on the table,'' says
Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget
Office who is now a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a
middle-of-the-road think tank here.
</P>
<P>
   Reischauer adds: ``This intensifies the debate in Washington and
Congress. It just whets everyone's appetite.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, sees the fevered jockeying between the White House and
Congress as an early skirmish in the 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the 2000 election ends up being about anything that
matters, it will be about what to do with the surplus,'' Sabato
said. ``It is obvious from what we are seeing now that Clinton and
the Republican Congress will not be able to reach agreement on
spending the surplus. There is just too much antagonism between
Clinton and Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Before dashing off to Connecticut and New York on a day-long
campaign fund-raising trip, Clinton said of the added revenues,
``Now we have the chance to do even more _ to use the fruits of our
prosperity today to strengthen our prospects for tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at a projected $5.9 trillion federal surplus over the
next 15 years, he proposed devoting $3.1 trillion of it to shore up
Social Security. That is roughly $400 billion more than the $2.7
trillion he proposed setting aside in February. The new sum would
prolong the solvency of the federal retirement program until 2053.
If nothing is done, it would not be able to pay full benefits
starting in 2034.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also proposed pouring $794 billion from the surplus into
Medicare, which provides health care coverage for 39 million
elderly and disabled Americans. That's $108 billion more than he
proposed in February. Unless Medicare is bolstered, it is expected
to go broke in 2008. Clinton's plan, which he will detail on
Tuesday, would extend its solvency until 2027 and would have the
federal government pick up a share of elderly Americans'
prescription drug costs for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also offered a new ``children's health and education
trust fund'' that envisions $156 billion in spending through 2014.
</P>
<P>
   And he proposed using all Social Security payroll taxes for
reducing the national debt, making them off-limits for other
spending. After a decade, he said, the government would credit the
interest savings from the debt reduction to Social Security, which
a senior administration official said would further lengthen its
solvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 2015, this country can be entirely out of debt ... if we do
not squander the surplus by choosing short-term gain over long-term
national goals,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the federal debt held by the public _ more
than half the $5.7 trillion national debt. The remainder is owed by
the federal government to itself _ including money Uncle Sam
siphoned off from Social Security trust funds that now must be
repaid.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have yet to
agree on how much to devote to Social Security and Medicare, are
pushing to devote a big chunk of the budget surplus to heavy tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton would provide $327 billion in tax breaks over 10
years, the latest Republican plan, produced by the House Ways and
Means Committee, would give $788 billion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are working to produce legislation next month to
eliminate the so-called marriage penalty, make substantial cuts in
estate taxes, and further reduce capital gains taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But since they have only a six-vote majority in the House, they
have found it difficult to unite behind a single spending
blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Conference Chairman J.C. Watts, R-Okla., said,
``Once the solvency of Social Security and Medicare has been
addressed, Congress should use the additional budget surplus to
provide working Americans with tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Davis, spokeswoman for House Majority Leader Richard
Armey, R-Texas, hailed the higher surplus estimates, saying: ``This
gives us more opportunity to get real Social Security and Medicare
reform done, and tax cuts, if the president wants to get them
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Finance Chairman William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., sounded a
hopeful note, saying the higher budget surplus projections ``give
us the opportunity to work together in a bipartisan way to save
Social Security, preserve Medicare while allowing for a
prescription drug benefit and significantly reduce taxes for
working Americans.''

CONSERVATIVES IN GOP ARE UNEASY ABOUT BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: This story was sent and held last night; it is now releatsed
for publication.)  
 (ATTN: N.H., Iowa)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LACONIA, N.H. _ Many politically active conservatives say they
are increasingly frustrated and distressed by the early dominance
of George W. Bush in the Republican presidential race. They accuse
their party of sacrificing principle in the name of pragmatism,
prompting some to talk of mounting a third-party campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In early battleground states like New Hampshire and Iowa, and
elsewhere in the country, rank-and-file conservatives said in
interviews that they had never felt so alienated from their own
party.
</P>
<P>
   They asserted that Bush was not sufficiently conservative on
matters like abortion and complained about the defense _ if not
outright embrace _ of Bush by the party establishment, including
some leaders of their own wing, like Pat Robertson, founder of the
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   They also cited compromises by Republican leaders in Washington
on issues like taxes, gun control, military spending and gay
rights. They are all the more uneasy, these conservatives said,
because they fear even at this early stage that Bush may be
unstoppable since no conservative champion has emerged from the
right to take on the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The disenchantment is so intense that more and more
conservatives at the grass roots are openly discussing whether to
bolt from their party altogether. One conservative who is running
for president, Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire, said he was so
fed up that he would decide in the next 30 days whether to seek the
presidency by creating his own party or running as a member of the
Reform or U.S. Taxpayer party.
</P>
<P>
   Another conservative contender, Pat Buchanan, the television
commentator, insisted last week that he would remain in the
Republican contest. But some of his advisers have recently mulled
over whether he should seek the nomination of the Reform Party of
Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   The discomfort among conservatives erupted in full view at a
town meeting in Manchester last week sponsored by Think New
Hampshire. The group was established by Jim Rubens, a former
Republican state senator who ran for governor last year, to promote
the party's principles. On a breezy summer night, more than 100
local Republicans gathered in an auditorium to stew over the state
of their party.
</P>
<P>
   The theme, as set out by Rubens at the start of the meeting, was
to ponder ``the gnawing question'' that he feared had
``demoralized'' Republicans: ``How do we resolve the tug of war
between principle and pragmatism _ between party ideals and the
pressure to compromise them?''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the audience voiced concerns that Republicans with an
eye on a general election victory in 2000 were moving too quickly
to dilute their positions on bedrock issues like abortion. Despite
Bush's command of the Republican field, not one participant
defended the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kenny, a freelance journalist in Manchester, drew
enthusiastic applause when he rose to a microphone in the audience
and asked: ``I wonder if any of us can tell the difference between
the Gore-Bush twins?''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny echoed many others who expressed concern about Bush,
including his refusal to rule out appointing court justices who are
not foes of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   David Corbin, a state representative in New Hampshire who
supports Alan Keyes for the nomination, said Bush might win the
nomination but lose the following November because he would not be
seen as standing for anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George W. will win 35 percent of the New Hampshire
primary vote,'' Corbin said, ``but if the idea is winning at any
cost, it may do more damage to the Republican Party in the long
term.''
</P>
<P>
   In Davenport, Iowa, the state that traditionally holds the first
caucuses, David Karwoski, a religious conservative organizer, said
that if Bush captures the nomination he could lose as Bob Dole did
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to placate the pro-choice people and the pro-life
people at the same time,'' said Karwoski, who is backing Gary
Bauer, ``the people who feel strongly about those issues are going
to have a huge question in their mind: Is he really with us? Can we
trust him? There's going to be a rude awakening in November.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews around the country, many conservatives repeat the
same mantra: They are worried that Bush is getting ``anointed.'' As
Gordon MacDonald, the New Hampshire director for the campaign of
former Vice President Dan Quayle, put it, ``There's a real concern
that the establishment of the party is foisting on them a candidate
who won't stand for their principles. It's feeding this
alienation.''
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives speak enthusiastically about the prospect of
abandoning the Republican Party. Citing how the Whigs unraveled in
the 1800s after the party was unable to reach a consensus on
slavery _ and paved the way for Republicans _ several conservatives
said Republicans could be similarly ravaged over abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you I'm not optimistic about the future of the
Republican Party,'' Richard Lessner, director of the editorial page
of The Union Leader, a beacon of conservatism in Manchester, said
at the town meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his participation on a radio talk show in Arizona
recently, Lessner said: ``What really sparked the telephone calls
is when the subject of third party came up. We can paper over this
talk. We can pretend that it doesn't exist. We can urge all
Republicans simply to set aside their differences and get together,
not shoot at one another, don't call one another nasty names,
everything will be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the sentiment out there for a third party is real,''
Lessner continued. ``It is deep. And it is growing. We had call
after call on that radio talk show out there, people calling and
saying, `You know, I'm a conservative, but I've just about given up
on the Republican Party.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Thomas Rath, a former state attorney general
who supports former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, implored the
audience to be more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop ripping each other's throats out in
primaries,'' Rath said. ``Ronald Reagan was right when he said a
person who agrees with me 80 percent of the time is not my enemy.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   At a Republican barbecue on Sunday at the Belknap County 4-H
Fairgrounds near here, Elizabeth Dole, who runs a distant second to
Bush in most polls, said in an interview that the party needed to
be more pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to her view that the party need not press for a
constitutional amendment on abortion, she said: ``This is a
dead-end discussion because it's not going to happen. Let's don't
fight each other in the party over something that doesn't have a
chance of happening. We're just churning and spending energy within
the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk infuriates Smith. In weighing a third-party bid, he
said he was worried that in the eagerness to broaden its appeal the
Republican Party was forfeiting its principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have one political party in America: It's run by
moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans, and conservatives are
stuck,'' Smith said in an interview. ``If you talk to conservative
activists there's a lot of frustration. I have no desire to see the
demise of the party. But I'm not going to see our views
compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Bush's impressive support, many conservatives are even
more unsettled because there are so many conservatives vying for
the nomination that their field is fractured and no one has emerged
to take on the leading candidate. Smith, Quayle, Buchanan and
Bauer, the former head of the Family Research Council, are
competing on the right with Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher,
and Keyes, a former State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate on the right who seemed to be gaining steam among
conservatives last year was Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri. But he
decided not to make the race, in part because he faces a tough
re-election challenge in 2000. Compounding the difficulties is the
fact that religious conservative groups seem to be losing
influence, particularly the Christian Coalition, which has been in
turmoil in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The activists can't get together on one candidate,'' Smith
said. ``If all of us were one candidate instead of split up, we'd
have 15 to 20 percent in the polls right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans have little sympathy for such talk. They say
conservatives should be grateful that Bush is playing smart
politics as Bill Clinton did in 1992 when he moderated his
positions and called for welfare reform, a balanced budget and a
middle-class tax cut. As Clinton did, Bush is following more of a
general election strategy _ appeal to the broadest base of support
_ in the primaries. For now at least, polls show that it seems to
be working.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers say they are confident that the governor is
popular enough to withstand attacks from conservatives without
moving to the right. Still, the hope among Democrats is that Bush
will be forced to appeal more to conservatives, which would make
him more vulnerable in a general election, when he would want to
win votes from independents and even Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among conservatives there is an enormous frustration because
the party isn't what it was four years ago,'' said Roger Stone, a
Republican strategist who is a moderate. ``The Christian Coalition
is in hard times. There's a tremendous thirst in the party to win.
Therefore, it seems to me that Bush is getting the pass that Dole
didn't get. I don't see any of these other guys getting any
traction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dave Philbrick, a conservative from Dover, is among those
who said he would not succumb to the allure of Bush as a candidate
who might win the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather,'' Philbrick said, ``go to bed with a clear
conscience after losing.''

QUAYLE PROPOSES TAX CUTS FOR PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once again championing family values, former Vice
President Dan Quayle proposed Monday steps that would allow more
working parents to stay at home with their children.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential hopeful said parents do not spend as
much time with their children as they would like because high taxes
and living costs drive both parents to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we should ask is that parents be allowed to follow their
hearts,'' Quayle said in a speech at the American Enterprise
Institute, a conservative think tank. ``The problem is that
millions of mothers and fathers don't feel like they have a choice
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   To lighten the financial burden on families, Quayle recommended
reducing income taxes by 30 percent and ending ``anti-family'' tax
codes.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also proposed extending existing tax credits for day care
to parents who take care of their children at home. And he
recommended that workers who buy their own health insurance because
their employers do not provide coverage should be able to deduct
the cost from their taxes as large corporations are able to do.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle called for changes in public education, such as more
charter schools, low-income scholarships and teacher tenure reform,
pushing for ``respect and responsibility'' to be added to the
``three R's of reading, writing, and arithmetic.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged an end to ``bias against stay-at-home moms,'' saying
``dollar power'' should not be attached to the work that women do
as mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every mother is a working mother. The term `working mother' is
redundant. It's sort of like `compassionate conservative,''' Quayle
said, taking a jab at Texas Governor George W. Bush, the Republican
front-runner who has described himself as a ``compassionate
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle urged employers to grant parents more flexible work
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst off are single mothers, who have to carry all of the
responsibilities on their own,'' said Quayle, who slammed the
television character ``Murphy Brown'' in 1992 for becoming an
out-of-wedlock parent. ``It's not that way in Hollywood,'' he said,
``but it's the real world for the single mom.''

   IZBICA, Yugoslavia _ It seemed a strangely peaceful, pastoral
spot, this mass grave, nestled in rolling hills of verdant
farmland, the green brightened by splotches of other colors _ red
poppies, purple thistles, white Queen Anne's lace and a half-dozen
or more shades of yellow _ the only sound the chirping of
songbirds.
</P>
<P>
   When a French forensic team working for the international war
crimes tribunal arrived here at 8 a.m. Monday, they expected to
find the bodies of about 160 Kosovo Albanians who other villagers
said were killed by Serbian forces on March 28.
</P>
<P>
   There were none. The Serbs seemed to have been here first, dug
up the grave and carried the bodies off somewhere, apparently in an
effort to destroy evidence before any war crimes trial could take
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bodies are gone now,'' said Yves Roy, an investigator on
the scene for the tribunal, which is located in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   But he said there was still plenty of evidence. This site was
listed as a count in the war crimes indictment of President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and three of his top aides.
</P>
<P>
   There was satellite reconnaissance imagery, photographs of which
were displayed by the State Department, and a videotape, shown on
CNN, made by a villager, of the bodies and the burials by Albanian
relatives and neighbors. The satellite photos showed neat rows of
graves, aligned to point to Mecca, in keeping with Islamic
tradition. The ground was featureless, churned earth.
</P>
<P>
   Disappearing bodies, however, are only one problem for the war
crimes investigators, who have six teams here now, an official
said, with six more soon to be in place. In some areas the bodies
are proliferating, with the killing here apparently far greater
than anyone had thought, even given the very specific accounts of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to prioritize. Every day we discover a new site, all
over Kosovo,'' Roy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' he added. ``We thought it was isolated. But
the more we see sites, 50 or 100 bodies _ the more people come
back, we'll get more and more. You see that in almost every
village. People come back, they see their grandmother, their
grandfather dead in their cellar. We discover more sites every day,
day by day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find all over Kosovo, there are people dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Striding up a hill, he showed where the group of Albanians,
almost entirely men, the oldest 96 and the youngest 14, had been
separated from the other villagers and marched away to be shot. The
shooters, he said, were soldiers of the Yugoslav army and the
special police of the Serbian Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The village, reachable only through miles of rough dirt roads in
the Drenica region, was the birthplace of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army. The population was about 1,500 in normal times. By
the day of the killings, it had swollen to about 5,000, Roy said,
with refugees from smaller villages fleeing shelling _ as was the
pattern in the early days of the Serbian depopulation campaign, and
which accelerated after the NATO bombing began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   He said that on March 27, the Yugoslav forces entered the
village. They later herded the men into two groups, roughly equal
in size, totaling about 150. He pointed across a hillside toward a
scraggly tree and said about 70 had been shot in the back there,
then finished off with shots to the head. He walked a little
farther up the hill, to a gulch, dry now, but a creek in March's
early spring runoff, cloaked with vegetation. He said the others
had been shot dead there, in three clumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just rounded them up, and they decided at this time to
shoot 150 people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after French soldiers and the forensic teams had gone over
the meadow Monday, there were still brass cartridge casings from
AK-47 rounds and 7.62 mm Russian machine gun bullets lying in a
rutted track.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many bullets,'' Roy said. ``All over the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hill, under the bright sun, a 10-member French forensic
team, in white coveralls, rubber gloves and sun hats with an extra
brim over the back of the neck slowly combed the freshly turned
earth. The team, headed by Dominique Lecomte of the Institute of
Legal Medicine in Paris, said that the bodies had been dug up with
a backhoe, leaving the distinctive six tooth marks of its shovel.
</P>
<P>
   Having carefully gridded the ground into roughly 25-foot squares
marked by red and yellow plastic tape and labeled A1, B1 and so on,
they said they had found bone fragments and pieces of clothing.
Rubber gloves, apparently used by the Serbs exhuming the bodies,
were also found nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Watching all the activity quietly from across the road, Zeqir
Krasniqi and his wife, Farije, said they had found three relatives
dead in their house when they returned from Albania four days ago,
and wondered who they could tell so that, somehow, it would be part
of the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my father, my uncle and my uncle's son,'' Krasniqi
said. ``They were massacred two weeks ago. It was terrible getting
in, from the smell, and only their bones were left.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Krasniqi added, her eyes tearing, ``The bodies were so
burned you couldn't identify them. But we knew it was them since
they were the only ones left in the house. It is a terrible feeling
to see your family like that.''

ANALYSIS: BIG SURPLUS DOES NOT GUARANTEE BUDGET COMPROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BUDGET-CLINTON, BUDGET-DEBT)  
(sw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the aftermath of the battle over impeachment
last winter, the friction between President Clinton and the
Republicans who control Congress was so intense that the gears of
government seemed likely to be paralyzed for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   But an extra half-trillion dollars can buy an awful lot of
lubrication.
</P>
<P>
   No one in either party was willing to predict confidently on
Monday that the budget windfall _ $25 billion next year, $179
billion over the next five years and $517 billion over the next
ten, a 20 percent larger surplus than was forecast in January _
would enable a peaceful resolution of long-standing disputes over
Social Security, Medicare, taxes, education and managed health
care. In their public statements, both sides said they would try.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton concluded his remarks on Monday morning by saying he
hoped ``very much to work with Congress in the weeks ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, declared,
``I hope the president's comments today indicate a summer of
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, though, members of both parties were
extremely cautious.
</P>
<P>
   An influential Republican senator said he and his colleagues
simply did not trust the president to do more than jockey for
political advantage. Even before the impeachment episode,
Republicans periodically questioned the president's word on budget
matters. Now they reflexively distrust it on nearly everything.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said he could not imagine anything
more than ``a token tax cut'' that Republicans would vote for and
that the president could swallow.
</P>
<P>
   The newfound money did allow the president, however, to open the
door a little wider to tax reductions, the central element in
Republican dogma. And it permitted Republicans to agree with the
president's point that hefty new spending may be needed to put
Medicare on a sound footing.
</P>
<P>
   That means Clinton can no longer hold, as he did in his 1996
campaign for re-election, that Republicans were determined to cut
Medicare to give tax breaks to the wealthy. And Republicans can
hardly accuse the president, as they did in their successful
campaign in 1994 to win control of Congress, of favoring the
biggest tax increase in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's moving toward us, and we're moving toward him,'' a
political strategist on a Republican staff in the House said.
</P>
<P>
   But as for the outcome, the staff member was uncertain. ``It's
either going to result in a hug, or it's going to result in a train
wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of this presidency, the relationship between
Clinton and Republicans in Congress has been dominated by fights
over the budget.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Clinton's first budget, which raised taxes and also was
the first step toward reducing what appeared at the time to be
indelible red ink, was approved without a single Republican vote in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 and early 1996, the budget dispute resulted in
government shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, an eleventh-hour discovery that the annual deficit
would be $50 billion less than anticipated _ a windfall not unlike
the one announced on Monday by the president _ led to passage of
the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, a cooperative arrangement for
which Clinton and Congress took credit.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, for the first time since modern budget procedures
were adopted in the 1970s, Congress was unable to agree on a
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Although these fights involved revenues and expenditures, they
were not primarily over money. They were mainly over competing
views of the role of government in society.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sees the government as a powerful engine for improving
people's lives. Taxes, in his view, are not too high, and the
revenues are needed to support the elderly and improve education.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant Republican view is that the government is an
impediment to social and economic advancement. The government
should be shrunk, Republicans maintain, and taxes should be lowered
so people can decide for themselves how to spend their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, the new budget boon does not help resolve some of
the main disagreements between the president and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, they both want to invest some Social Security
money in the stock market. But the president wants the government
to control the investment. Republicans want individuals to have
their own private investment accounts. Neither seems willing to
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   On the matter of taxes, Republicans favor measures like a lower
capital gains tax and a reduction or even abolition of taxes on
inheritances. The beneficiaries would largely be the most affluent
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts the president favors would aim at specific social
goals like making child-care more affordable and helping
communities raise money to build and modernize schools.
</P>
<P>
   As a political matter, Clinton's popularity has tended to rise
in periods of confrontation like those of the government shutdowns
and the impeachment hearings. And Republicans have gained when
there has been accommodation, as in the 1997 budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   So it might seem that Congress would be looking for a deal, and
the president would prefer an issue. But that may not be the case.
</P>
<P>
   The word at the White House on Monday was that the lame-duck
president is thinking more nowadays about legacy than politics. And
in Congress, the bad feelings toward the president among
Republicans and the distaste for cooperating with him can hardly be
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Monday afternoon, Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi, the Republican leader, began by talking of the
potential for accommodation. But by the end, he could not resist
sticking the needle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he wants to work with us and then he flies off to
fund-raisers,'' Lott declared. ``I don't know if he's serious or
not.''

NEW FLOOD OF REFUGEES, 75,000 SERBS, STRAINS AID RESOURCES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Fearing vengeance from returning Kosovo
Albanians, about a quarter of the Serbs in Kosovo _ more than
75,000 _ have fled the province in the 18 days since Serbian forces
began pulling out of the province, according to officials from the
Yugoslav Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials said they were running short of food and other
supplies to care for a flood of refugees that they did not expect
and are not prepared to handle.
</P>
<P>
   The senior official in Belgrade for the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees said the plight of the Serbs who have become refugees
inside Serbia is urgent, although not yet desperate. He said, too,
that the world has an obligation to act quickly to help the
homeless Serbs this summer, just as it acted in the spring to help
Albanians chased out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a risk the international community will not maintain
its objectivity and sensitivity,'' said Eduardo Arbleda, the
representative here for the refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, running from what aid officials in Kosovo describe as
a dangerous and unstable situation, are the latest in a seemingly
endless and invariably miserable series of forced mass migrations
that have characterized life in the former Yugoslavia during a
decade of ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger for this latest exodus, which is sending most of the
Serbs into impoverished towns in central Serbia where factories and
bridges have been pounded by NATO bombs, was the success of the
alliance's effort to undo the forced exodus of nearly one million
Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Reassured by the presence of NATO forces, more than 415,000
Kosovo Albanians have returned so far, and hundreds of thousands
more are expected in coming weeks. But aid officials say that many
of them are coming back with their hearts set on vengeance and that
the 21,000 NATO troops deployed so far are not enough to guarantee
the safety of Serbian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are very much under siege and very much want to get
out,'' Dennis McNamara, the special envoy to the Balkans for the
U.N. refugee agency, said by phone from Pristina, the Kosovo
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The agency estimated last week that 50,000 Serbs had fled Kosovo
for Serbia. But Arbleda, the agency's chief here in Belgrade, said
the 75,000 figure given Monday by officials from the Yugoslav Red
Cross, who did not want to be identified, is probably more
accurate. All these numbers, aid officials say, are rough estimates
because of the confused flow of people in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of Serbs into Serbia has pushed the government of
President Slobodan Milosevic into an awkward corner.
</P>
<P>
   This country is destitute, with unemployment surging this year
to more than 33 percent and the government unable to pay many
salaries and pensions. The unexpected arrival of tens of thousands
of homeless people in Serbia proper _ after the half million Serbs
who came here after fleeing Croatia and Bosnia in the middle of the
decade and who still receive aid _ is pushing the capacity of
Serbian relief agencies to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not an optimist,'' said Rade Dubajic, secretary-general
of the Yugoslav Red Cross. ``We can expect very hard and difficult
times. Donors are mostly concentrated on Kosovo. They are not so
interested in the rest of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Milosevic government has refused to level with the
Serbian people about the size of the refugee problem. It continues
to sell military defeat in Kosovo as victory.
</P>
<P>
   State television has soft-pedaled the severe security problems
that are forcing Serbs from Kosovo. Again Monday night, television
emphasized that many Kosovo Serbs were returning home and that the
security situation was improving _ an impression that aid officials
in Kosovo say is grossly misleading.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under pressure from the government here, Serbian aid officials
are appealing for international help for the refugee problem, but
they are not allowed to quantify the size of the problem, at least
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not presenting the numbers of Serbian refugees for
psychological reasons, because if those Serbs remaining in Kosovo
heard the numbers, they might also leave,'' said Dubajic, who
refused any comment on how many Serbs have fled Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   An official here for the International Committee of the Red
Cross said Monday that food and relief supplies were being trucked
this week to central Serbian cities that are in acute need and that
more supplies were on their way from Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might have a shortage here and there,'' said the official,
Dominique Dufour. ``But aid is on its way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic government has asked the U.N. refugee agency to
help it return Serbs to Kosovo, but so far that request is not
being acted on.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people just got to Serbia, and we want to verify that
they want to come back to Kosovo and that it is safe for them to do
so,'' McNamara said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition party leaders said Monday that Serbs from Kosovo were
under pressure by the Milosevic government to go back to Kosovo,
even though they are afraid to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In the central Serbia city of Kragujevac on Sunday, a number of
Serbs from Kosovo said they would consider going back to their
homes only if large numbers of Serbian policemen returned with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the peace deal that Milosevic signed with
NATO, the Serbian police will be allowed back into Kosovo only to
guard monasteries and other historical Serbian landmarks.

ROOMS WITH A WORLD VIEW: SEATTLE TACKLES BIG PLANS FOR WTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Got 5,000 guests coming to town? Where are you going
to put them all? And what about pesky guests who think they're
special? You know. Like President Clinton. Or maybe Fidel Castro.
And then there's the minister of this and the minister of that.
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization's hosts face just such a daunting
task when the international group gathers in Seattle Nov. 30.
Official and semi-official guests will fill about 5,000 rooms.
President Clinton will be here, and while Fidel Castro isn't on the
list of those who have already RSVP'd, he could be here.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out where they're going to stay, and who gets which
room, is a world-class juggling act that's already under way.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO's 136 member governments are being offered rooms in 29
hotels, with ordinary rooms starting at $79 at the Quality Inn and
topping out at $315 at the Four Seasons Olympic, plus 15.6 percent
hotel tax. Then come the junior suites, corner suites, specialty
suites and presidential suites.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to be here for the opening
session. During the APEC meeting in 1993, he stayed at the Westin,
which has a presidential suite on the top floor of the north tower.
Presidents Bush and Reagan stayed there, as did Queen Elizabeth.
With the four adjoining bedrooms, it takes up the whole 47th floor
and totals $1,975 plus tax of $308.10. It has a marble bath, a
big-screen audio-video system, wet bar and room to receive 90
guests. It is said to have good security. The Westin is also one of
only three WTO hotels (the others are the Edgewater and the Hilton)
that are union, which traditionally matters to Democratic
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   As one wag reported during the APEC meet a few years ago, the
Westin also has a McDonald's across the street, in case the
Commander-in-Chief has one of his Big Mac cravings.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the U.S. government has not told the Seattle
committee where it plans to stay, a matter of some concern here.
``We need to know what we have left over,'' said Don Lorentz,
director of development for the Port of Seattle and head of the
Seattle Host Organization's accommodations committee.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government is expected to take about 800 rooms, some
for its own delegates and officials, some for the 150 WTO officials
from Geneva and some for a handful of countries too poor to come
here on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dozen countries are coming with no credit cards _ no
government credit cards,'' said Washington Secretary of State Ralph
Munro. ``The U.S will pay all their expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Then come about another 115 countries. Middle-sized countries,
with the economic size of, say, Sweden, are expected to send about
25 delegates each.
</P>
<P>
   Assignment of hotels is being handled by Columbia Resource
Group. Leasa Mayer, president and chief operating officer, said,
``Some countries are very focused on price, some countries on
location. So far, there are no conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who thought the China-Taiwan issue could be avoided,
because neither so far is a member of WTO, think again: Both will
be here. Taiwan, which will be called Chinese Taipei, has asked for
100 rooms at the Westin for delegates and journalists, says Frank
Liu, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office here.
</P>
<P>
   Most delegations haven't responded yet. Japan will bring 128
delegates, the second-largest group after the United States. The
consulate here says it has asked to stay at the Westin, which has
one of the city's premier Japanese restaurants, Nikko, on the
ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, which expects a large delegation, has asked for one of
the more moderate-priced hotels, a spokeswoman said. (The mid-price
hotels, $125-$169, include Cavanaugh's, Crowne Plaza, Mayflower,
Roosevelt, Hilton and Warwick.)
</P>
<P>
   The European Union and European Council, with 100 members, will
stay at the Sheraton, said John Richardson, deputy head of
delegation. The Sheraton is the closest to the meetings, which will
be at the Washington State Visitors and Convention Center. It also
has a lot of meeting rooms where delegations can plot strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeting space is at much more of a premium than hotel rooms,''
Mayer says. Also important is 24-hour room service; delegates
expect to work, and to communicate with their home governments, at
all hours.
</P>
<P>
   The unanswered question is heads of state. The WTO ministerial
is not a meeting of leaders, like APEC was; but the last WTO
ministerial, held in May 1998 in Geneva, attracted Nelson Mandela
and Fidel Castro. Mandela has retired, but it is not impossible to
imagine Castro strolling in green fatigues down Pine Street among
the Christmas shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Waldmann, head of the Host Organization, notes that the
Geneva meeting was a party for the organization's 50th birthday,
and the Seattle meeting will be work. Perhaps that will change how
many leaders show up. One insider says perhaps 15 will come. ``We
have no idea,'' Waldmann said. ``We could handle 15 or so,
especially if they were not all here at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the officials are the NGOs, the non-governmental
organizations, which could include everyone from The Boeing Co. to
the Sierra Club. Some of these groups will be participating in the
meetings; some will be protesting in the streets. Some will get
rooms through the Seattle Host Organization; some won't.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure will be on the local organizers. They are the ones
raising the corporate contributions ($5 million pledged so far, of
a $9.2 million goal), arranging the transportation and assigning
the hotels. The U.S. State Department will review the arrangements,
but Lorentz says, ``We will take the heat if someone is unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't complain about that. The meeting, he says, is a
moderately big deal for Washington, D.C. It is a big, big deal for
Seattle. ``This is something that puts us in the eyes of the
world,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle boosters are hoping the round of talks that begins here
and will last for at least three years will be called the Seattle
Round _ just as an earlier round, begun in Tokyo, was called the
Tokyo Round. It's good advertising, like Safeco getting its name on
the Mariners stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But not all rounds are named after cities. One that began in
Montevideo, Uruguay, was called the Uruguay Round, and one that was
started by President Kennedy and was called the Kennedy Round.
``Perhaps you can call it the Clinton Round,'' a local diplomat
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union negotiator, has suggested
it be called the Millennium Round. To that idea, Rep. Jim McDermott
said in a recent speech, ``It suggests that it's going to go on for
a thousand years.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson of the European Union suggested it could be the
Seattle Round. ``Who knows?'' he said. ``Maybe that will partly
depend on how pleased people are at the arrangements in Seattle.''

ACTIVISTS DECRY FLEET-BANKBOSTON LOW-INCOME LENDING PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- An activist group Monday criticized a recent proposal
by Fleet Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp. to lend $14.6
billion to low-income borrowers and community projects over five
years, saying the two banks would do less in those arenas after
they merge.
</P>
<P>
   The group, based in New York and known as Inner City
Press/Community on the Move, said it drew its conclusion based on
Fleet-BankBoston's lending proposal and merger-related documents
filed by both banks to the Federal Reserve Board, an industry
regulator that must approve the two companies' combination.
</P>
<P>
   New England's two leading banks rebutted Inner City's finding,
saying the organization had used faulty methodologies and
incomplete or inaccurate statistics. In particular, the banks said,
the group failed to consider that the acquirer of the branches and
deposits that Fleet-BankBoston is selling to meet antitrust
guidelines will assume the community lending requirements for those
assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that is taken into consideration, the amount of community
lending you will get from the combined bank will be equal to or
greater than what you see now,'' said Marjorie Arons-Barron, a
BankBoston spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Community lending has emerged as a major issue for banks that
merge. Quarrels over lending proposals can delay combinations or
lead their participants to make concessions to please regulators,
politicians, and local groups.
</P>
<P>
   Inner City's newest report comes one week before the Boston Fed
will hold public hearings on the Fleet-BankBoston merger, which
will create a $160 billion institution and the dominant bank in New
England. The group, which lobbies on behalf of low-income urban
areas and against bank mergers, released a study earlier this month
suggesting that Fleet has historically reduced lending to
lower-income and minority borrowers after it acquires banks.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Lee, Inner City's executive director, said in the small
business lending arena, Fleet made $1.45 billion in loans last year
compared to BankBoston's $588 million, for a total of $2.1 billion.
Using a formula that takes into account the fact that
Fleet-BankBoston will be 20 percent slimmer after divestiture, Lee
said the combined company would have to spend $8.4 billion on small
business loans over five years, or at least 12 percent more than
the $7.5 billion it has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   For community development lending last year, Fleet made $486
million in loans compared to BankBoston's $245 million. The $2
billion that the combined bank is proposing to lend over five years
is 46 percent less than the $2.9 billion Inner City says is needed
to maintain previous levels.
</P>
<P>
   Inner City did not have individual figures for Fleet's mortgage
lending to lower- and middle-income borrowers last year, and could
not make workable comparisons to the $4 billion that
Fleet-BankBoston proposes spending on this front.
</P>
<P>
   But it called the combined bank's mortgage-lending proposal
``laughable.'' Fleet drew criticism earlier this decade for its
home-loan practices but later took steps to boost lower-income
lending.
</P>
<P>
   Inner City said Fleet originated or purchased $35.5 billion in
mortgage loans to all types of borrowers last year, to BankBoston's
$1.7 billion. Neither bank could immediately provide details for
their recent lower-income lending records.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet-BankBoston ceased accepting bids Monday for the $12
billion in deposits and nearly $2 billion in loans it is selling _
the largest bank divestiture in US history.
</P>
<P>
   A Fleet spokesman, James Mahoney, declined to say how many bids
had been received. But one banking industry executive said the two
banks had extended the bidding deadline by several days for
Citizens Financial Group Inc., the Providence bank that bought UST
Corp. last week. The reason, the executive said, was to give the
new Citizens time to put together a bid _ if it decided to do so.

STOCKS ADVANCE IN LIGHT TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices staged a broad advance on Monday, helped
by a rally in the bond market. But with the Federal Reserve
scheduled to begin two days of policy-making meetings on Tuesday,
the pace of trading was subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of uncertainty about the wisdom of
chasing stocks right now,'' said Ned Collins, head equity trader at
Daiwa Securities America. ``We had a nice, fairly broad-based
market rally today, but people are wondering if this is part of a
quarter-end price markup in front of the Fed meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by financial stocks like J.P. Morgan, American Express and
Citigroup, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.59 points, or
nearly 1 percent, to 10,655.15.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market measures did even better.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 16.04, or 1.2
percent, to 1,331.35. Retailers like Wal-Mart and technology stocks
like Microsoft, Lucent Technologies and Worldcom MCI were among the
biggest gainers in the index.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks had a volatile day, but a late surge pushed the
Nasdaq composite index up 49.79, or 1.95 percent, to 2,602.44. And
the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks gained 5.5 points,
or 1.2 percent, to 448.61.
</P>
<P>
   However, with the Fed meeting looming in the immediate future,
trading volume was light.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange 652.9 million shares were traded,
the third-lowest total of the year. On Nasdaq, 761.9 million shares
changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Given recent statements by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and
other central bank officials, there is a broad consensus in
financial markets that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates
by one-quarter of a percentage point when the meeting concludes on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it is far less clear whether a move by the Fed would be a
one-time event or the first of a series of moves. That uncertainty
is likely to be removed when _ and if _ the Fed announces it has
raised rates. Still, the Fed's message could come as an unwelcome
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the language of the Fed announcement suggests that this is
the first of a series of moves, that would be a problem for the
market,'' said Philip S. Dow, a managing director in equity
research at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the market is looking for negatives at a time when
second-quarter earnings, which will start coming out next week, are
going to be very good,'' he said. ``For people who look at
investing as a marathon, not a footrace, this is a pretty good time
to be positioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which have been jostled by rising interest
rates, soared on Monday's rally in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan was the biggest gainer in the Dow, rising 5{, to 134
1/16. American Express gained 2 13/16, to 125\. Citigroup jumped 2
3/16, to 46. And Merrill Lynch rose 2 13/16, to 74 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stores and computer software makers were also strong
performers.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores gained 2[, to 45 9/16. Dayton Hudson rose 2|, to
66~. And Microsoft gained 1 13/16, to 86}.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks struggled.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon fell 1, to 75 3/16. Royal Dutch Shell fell {, to 58 7/16.
And Mobil declined 1 1/16, to 95|.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement from Philip Morris that it does not plan to
separate its tobacco and food businesses met with little reaction.
Philip Morris closed at 41, down 3/16.

 &HT;    Longtime Braves scouting director leaving organization
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In a surprise announcement Monday afternoon, Paul
Snyder, the longtime Braves director of scouting and player,
announced he was giving up his duties to spend more time with his
family. Snyder, 63, will remain with the club in a to-be-specified
special assistant's role.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate replacement was named.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have one in place in a week or 10 days,'' said general
manager John Schuerholz. ``But right now, we thought it'd be more
appropriate to make the announcement now to better focus on Paul's
accomplishments and his contribututions to the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz would not comment on whether Deric Ladnier, the
club's current director of minor league operations, was a candidate
for the post.
</P>
<P>
   Synder signed with the Braves as a catcher prospect in 1957 and
though he never made the majors due in part to a back injury, he
never left the organization. He managed in the minor leagues,
served as the team's first stadium manager when it moved to Atlanta
and then turned to scouting, joining the front office in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've decided it's time to change gears, slow down and spend
more time with my wife and family,'' Synder said. ``These past 42
years have been wonderful. I'm bless to have been a Brave my entire
career and for that, I am grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz said Snyder first brought up his wish to step aside
last winter but guided the club through one more free agent draft
earlier this month before formal announcement was made. He will
help advise his replacement through a transition period before
assuming his new role, which will remain scouting oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Hudek ready to show off
</P>
<P>
   John Hudek showed up for work Monday. The Braves' trick is to
find him some.
</P>
<P>
   Before assuming the demoted Justin Speier's sixth seat in the
bullpen, Hudek had spent on a month-long injury re-hab assignment
with Class AAA Richmond with the idea of finding innings and
working on his slider. His statistics aside _ 6.35 ERA, 14 hits and
17 strikeouts in 11-1/3 innings _ he claimed the month a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going after hitters, develop the breaking ball on a more
consistent basis, get back to the style of pitcher that I was
before,'' Hudek said. ``Also realistically, a lot of it was just
getting innings. I needed to get out there and throw because the
first month and a half, there weren't very many innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Hudek do much to merit them. After coming over the Mark
Wohlers trade, Hudek allowed nine earned runs and 13 hits in 8-2/3
innings before a series of three blisters on the middle finger of
his pitching hand put him on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   He is anxious to test his new slider - a sharper, later break
opposed to a more sweeping curve before.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Walt Weiss again tested his right quadriceps before
the game, running at 80 percent, and though he felt no discomfort,
the Braves remain reluctant to activate him from the DL to play on
the articifical surface at Olympic. . . . Monday marked reliever
Kevin McGlinchy's 22nd birthday. He is the second youngest Brave, a
year older than Odalis Perez but two months younger than Andruw
Jones. . . . .Heavy rains in Montreal only underscored the
strutural problems that have plagued Olympic Stadium during the
Expos' residency. The building was leaking on three different
floors from the rains and a main entrance through the Metro
concourse was under three inches of water.

   SEATTLE _ The show was a gas, as Frank Sinatra liked to say.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of June 9, 1957, the 41-year-old pop star strolled
up to a microphone at Seattle's old Civic Auditorium and opened
with a buoyant ``You Make Me Feel So Young,'' one of nearly 20
songs he sang that night.
</P>
<P>
   Backing Sinatra for the rare Seattle performance _ his first
since a 1935 appearance with the Major Bowes radio troupe _ was a
26-piece orchestra led by Nelson Riddle, Sinatra's musical director
and favorite vocal arranger of the 1950s. The most expensive
tickets were $5.50.
</P>
<P>
   It was a magical night, full of humor, artistry, excitement.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a night almost lost to time _ until the discovery of
a lost tape in the Sinatra family archives, a tape that has now
resurfaced as a new live album.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a smart-looking suit, Sinatra crooned through a
selection including ``It Happened in Monterey,'' ``At Long Last
Love,'' ``I Get a Kick Out of You'' and Cole Porter's ``Just One of
Those Things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrapped the Cole Porter song up neatly, briskly and
delivered it stamped with the Sinatra style, which is as much as
anyone could wish for a Porter tune,'' wrote critic Ann Faber in
the Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed and in good spirits after a flight from Portland, where
he had performed a matinee earlier in the day, Sinatra was in the
mood to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about up to here in Crown Royal,'' he boasted halfway
through the show. ``We snared a batch of that stuff last night.
It's going to be awfully drunk in Los Angeles for the next five
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra interjected an impression of Louis Prima (``Lose-a da
charm''), made a joke about his misadventure in Spain a few years
earlier with Ava Gardner and shrugged off a vocal flub during
``Glad to Be Unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   After concluding with the self-affirming ``Oh! Look at Me Now,''
he pretended to head off to the nearest bar while the orchestra
played ``From Here to Eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Sinatra demonstrated that pure professionalism can belt
a nightclub act into the farthest corner of the Civic Auditorium,''
Faber wrote in her review.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Seattle concert, one of the best examples of Sinatra
and Riddle at work on the road, is featured in the new album from
Artanis Entertainment Group, the label founded by Sinatra's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinatra '57 in Concert,'' available on 24-karat gold CD and
``virgin vinyl'' audiophile LP, was produced by daughter Tina. It's
the second album from Artanis; the first was ``The Summit,''
featuring a 1962 concert by Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinatra '57'' includes 19 songs, among them ``The Lady Is a
Tramp,'' ``Violets for Your Furs,'' ``One for My Baby,'' ``A Foggy
Day,'' ``The Tender Trap'' and ``They Can't Take That Away From
Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Each numbered copy includes a 16-page booklet with an
introduction by longtime Sinatra fan Kelsey Grammer, star of the
Seattle-based TV sitcom ``Frasier,'' and liner notes by Sinatra
historian Will Friedwald, author of the book ``Sinatra: The Song Is
You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about this concert is that Sinatra isn't in his
best voice, but his spirit is indefatigable,'' Friedwald said by
phone from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally, he can't hit notes and he's straining, but who
cares? His determination to entertain his fans is just so much more
important than the fact that he's not at his best vocally.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra's 1957 Seattle concert might have been lost to history
had it not been for a man named Wally Heider.
</P>
<P>
   Heider, one of Sinatra's favorite recording engineers, often
traveled up and down the West Coast to record concerts by his
favorite big bands. Using the best equipment he could pack into the
trunk of his car, Heider taped Sinatra's concert at the Civic
Auditorium (now Mercer Arena) and later gave a copy of it to his
Hollywood pal.
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten for decades, Heider's tape of the Seattle show
surfaced after Sinatra's death last year.
</P>
<P>
   Heider, who operated one of Hollywood's top studios, would drive
as far as Portland and Seattle to record shows, Friedwald said. His
recording of Sinatra at the Civic Auditorium, later remodeled for
the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, carries listeners back in time. And
yet it sounds as though it was recorded yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wally's passion was big-band music, particularly location
recordings,'' Friedwald said. ``He was really kind of a genius in
capturing these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Heider often made copies of his tapes for friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wally was very anxious to share things,'' Friedwald said. ``I
know copies eventually found their way into the Sinatra
underground, so to speak, and were circulating that way.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Seattle concert, Sinatra was filming ``Pal
Joey'' and had completed work on ``The Pride and the Passion''
(directed by Stanley Kramer and co-starring Cary Grant and Sophia
Loren) and ``The Joker Is Wild,'' which spawned the hit single
``All the Way.'' The infamous Rat Pack was in its heyday, and
Sinatra was between girlfriends Lauren Bacall and Juliet Prowse.
</P>
<P>
   Friedwald isn't surprised Sinatra never released Heider's tape
of the Seattle show.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sinatra was alive there just seemed to be so much Sinatra
product around,'' Friedwald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say that he heard this concert and rejected
it, but the live album was one of the few things where other people
_ Ella Fitzgerald, Tony Bennett, Judy Garland and others _ beat him
to the punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra finally released a live album, ``Live at the Sands,'' in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   In his liner notes, Friedwald describes Sinatra as the man who
invented the pop album as we know it today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly in the big-band years and the era that followed,
singers were really just a part of the machinery,'' Friedwald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinatra went to the point of having the approval of all his
material and usually worked on it before the date so he knew the
songs when he came in.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra also studied the orchestration, often outlining exactly
what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinatra was one of the first singers to take charge of his own
musical destiny,'' Friedwald said.
</P>
<P>
   The promoters of Sinatra's Seattle show were local theater
impresarios Jack Engerman and Zollie Volchok, later general manager
of the Seattle SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone at his Seattle area home, Volchok recalled that
Sinatra's management had asked him to make three reservations for
the singer's after-show meal _ one at a Chinese restaurant, another
at an Italian restaurant and one at a steakhouse. ``They never knew
what mood Sinatra was going to be in after a show,'' Volchok
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Volchok also recalled that Sinatra, who arrived in Seattle on a
charter flight with his entire entourage of musicians, was
surrounded by handlers. ``Any time we wanted to talk to him, we had
to go through his management, until after when he had a few
drinks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volchok was surprised that a live recording of the show has
surfaced more than 40 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that they had permission to tape the show, but
it certainly wasn't to our knowledge,'' he said.

KOSOVO REBELS APPEAR TO OBEY DEADLINE ON TURNING IN WEAPONS

   SUHAREKE, Yugoslavia _ Soldiers with the Kosovo Liberation Army
appear to be obeying a major deadline in their agreement with NATO
and have started handing over weapons and gathering in specified
areas, military officials in Kosovo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leaders everything they discussed with NATO leaders,
said Lt. Col. Dietmar Jeserich, a spokesman for the German sector
in the south. ``It is working well.''
</P>
<P>
   After midnight Monday, the Kosovo Albanian rebel fighters were
required to gather in specified areas that one rebel commander
described as informal barracks in places like ``goat barns.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also has to establish sites to store weapons that NATO
will be allowed to inspect. In three months, all the weapons, apart
from rifles in the gathering areas and the pistols of commanders'
bodyguards, have to be placed in those sites.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline Monday was important because it was the first major
step in the agreement, signed a week ago between NATO and the
guerrillas for their demilitarization. Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO
commander, called Monday a ``key day'' and said he thought that the
agreement was secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we are getting good cooperation at the top of the
KLA,'' Clark said, referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army, in an
interview with the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many revenge attacks on Serbs by Kosovo Albanians,
he said, ``the issue is how the individual members do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is terrible anger here, terrible things have been done
to Kosovar Albanians,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the British-controlled section, in the center of Kosovo,
officials said the rebels appeared to be complying with the accord.
Here in the south, in the German sector, Jeserich said rebel
soldiers had started to move into the gathering areas and were
putting weapons into three official storage areas.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, there were no reports that rebel soldiers were
seen Monday carrying weapons, and fewer and fewer were seen wearing
their uniforms, which is not longer permitted outside the gathering
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me tonight is the last night for uniforms,'' one
rebel soldier said Monday night as he walked in fatigues in
downtown Prizren. He said he intended to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rigid language and deadlines in the agreement,
military officials acknowledged that it had many shortcomings that
were almost impossible to overcome. One big issues is whether the
rebel group will hand over every weapon that it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope so,'' Jeserich said. ``I think that most of the
weapons we will get. But there are so many weapons in this country.
I think every man has a weapon in his bed.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton laid out his proposal Monday to
use the fast-growing federal budget surplus to eliminate the
national debt while shoring up Social Security and Medicare, and
left open the possibility of a deal with the Republican Congress
over its demand for big tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan could set the stage for a grand compromise with
Republicans encompassing new spending on the military and social
programs as well as tax cuts and the fate of the two giant
retirement-security programs _ or could lead to a hardening of
positions and a bitter struggle extending into the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who plan to begin a push in the next few weeks to
pass a $775 billion, 10-year tax cut in the face of a veto threat,
welcomed the news of a growing surplus and said they were heartened
by some aspects of Clinton's proposal. But they remained suspicious
of Clinton, who has repeatedly bested them in budget politics and
like them is torn between a desire for a bipartisan deal and the
need for potent campaign issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in deeds, not words,'' said Sen. Trent Lott
of Mississippi, the Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions of budget trends have as often as not proven wildly
inaccurate, and the current rosy estimates rest in part on
assumptions that the economy will avoid any prolonged downturns.
The Congressional Budget Office plans to unveil its own surplus
estimates this week, and they are expected to be even larger than
the White House numbers disclosed by Clinton on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing new calculations by the White House's Office of
Management and Budget, Clinton said the surplus will be more than
20 percent higher over the next 10 years than projected just five
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   From 2000 through 2009, the total surplus is anticipated to be a
cumulative $2.93 trillion, up from an estimate of $2.4 trillion in
February, putting more than $500 billion additional on the table.
Over 15 years, the surplus will be more than $1 trillion larger
than previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surplus is the hard-earned product of our fiscal
discipline,'' Clinton said in an appearance Monday morning on the
White House South Lawn before leaving on a fund-raising trip to
Connecticut and New York. ``We should use it to prepare for the
great challenges facing our country _ caring for our parents,
caring for our children, freeing our nation from the shackles of
debt so that we can have long-term sustained economic prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, the new administration projections show that
the government will reach a milestone next year when it will not
only run a surplus, but for the first time since 1960 will spend
less than it takes in even without including revenues generated by
Social Security payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The $70 billion surplus the government posted last year and the
estimated $99 billion it is running this year are completely
accounted for by revenues that are technically earmarked for the
retirement system but that in practice go into a pot with all other
tax receipts.
</P>
<P>
   The non-Social Security surplus next year will be tiny in the
context of a $1.9 trillion budget _ about $5 billion _ but it will
grow rapidly, and will total more than $1 trillion over the next 10
years, according to the White House projections. The administration
had previously not foreseen a non-Social Security surplus until
2002.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the projections foresee a considerably more
far-reaching accomplishment: the elimination by 2015 of the federal
debt held by the public, which stands at $3.6 trillion and has long
hurt the economy by forcing up interest rates and requiring a big
chunk of tax revenues for interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now cut up Washington's credit card,'' Clinton said.
``Now we can pay off the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's basic approach was to dangle the possibility of
agreeing to a deal on tax cuts and new spending if Congress would
go along with his new ideas for Social Security and Medicare, both
of which face severe financial problems in coming decades as the
baby boom generation retires.
</P>
<P>
   He did not formally propose lifting tight spending caps that
have left Congress struggling to pass appropriations bills this
year even as the pot of excess money grows. But in a nod to his own
party's priorities, he said he wanted to spend $156 billion of the
surplus over the next decade on domestic programs including
education, child care and health, a sum that would require the caps
to be revised or eliminated in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   On tax cuts, administration officials said they would
concentrate on passing Clinton's proposal for tax incentives
intended to stimulate more retirement savings among low and middle
income families. But when asked if he could support additional tax
cuts, Clinton left the door open to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the framework of achieving these objectives, obviously
I'll be working with the Congress to achieve them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The president is scheduled to release a detailed new plan on
Tuesday for overhauling Medicare. He said Monday that it would
include using nearly $800 billion from the surplus over the next 15
years to keep the system of health insurance for the elderly afloat
at least until 2025, an improvement of a decade over previous
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton effectively backed off of his previous demand that
Social Security's financial health be assured for 75 years, the
traditional actuarial benchmark for long-term solvency. Instead,
administration officials said that while they would still like to
complete an overhaul of Social Security for the long run, Clinton
would be willing to unlock the surplus for tax cuts and new
spending as long as Congress and the administration can make
substantial progress on bolstering Social Security's finances.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that end, Clinton offered a variant of ideas that
both he and members of Congress from both parties have been
debating for months. He acceded to demands from Republicans that
none of the excess Social Security taxes be available for spending,
a shift from his previous proposal that would have allowed some of
the Social Security money to go for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he proposed that all Social Security tax revenues _
more than $3 trillion over the next 15 years _ go to reducing the
national debt. In addition, Clinton would funnel general tax
revenues into Social Security starting in 2011, in an amount equal
to the interest saved by reducing the debt over the previous decade
_ $107 billion in 2011, rising to $166 billion in 2014.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would insure Social Security's solvency through 2053.
If nothing is done, Social Security will run short of money to pay
benefits starting in 2034.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the new approach appeared to be an improvement
over Clinton's original Social Security proposal earlier this year,
which relied on what Republicans said was an accounting gimmick.
But the plan set out by Clinton Monday would funnel the new money
into Social Security via a mechanism that Republicans have long
since rejected: by having the Social Security trust fund buy stocks
and corporate bonds.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's approach would give Social Security tangible
assets with which to finance retirement benefits rather than paper
promises from the Treasury, it runs afoul of Republican opposition
to the idea of government as an investor in private industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a proposal that's doomed to fail from the beginning,''
said Richard E. May, a former Republican staff director for the
House Budget Committee who is now a lobbyist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   News of the improving fiscal picture called to mind 1997, when a
budget windfall helped break a political logjam and allow both
parties to agree to a balanced budget plan. In that case, both
parties got enough of what they wanted to be able to claim victory.
</P>
<P>
   There is now clearly enough money for the White House and the
Republican leadership to work out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But that prospect makes rank and file members of both parties
nervous. Conservative Republicans fear that Clinton will again win
a substantial increase in spending, ending their hopes of reducing
the size and influence of the federal government. Liberal Democrats
fear that Clinton will sell out their concerns about the poor and
children in order to chalk up a legacy-enhancing accomplishment
near the end of a presidency marred by the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The political calculus is complicated by Clinton's desire to
help the campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham
Clinton. Eliminating Social Security, Medicare and tax cuts as
issues for the next election could deprive Mrs. Clinton, Gore and
Democrats who are hopeful or regaining control of the House of
time-tested themes in their races.
</P>
<P>
   There are also deep and sincere divisions over policy and
ideology, as illustrated by the failure of efforts to find common
ground on Social Security despite a year and a half of bipartisan
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Having huge new sums of money available ``makes it easier to get
a deal, but it doesn't make it easy,'' said Rudolph G. Penner, a
former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now a
senior fellow at the Urban Institute. ``There will still be huge
arguments within the parties and between the parties about the
proper way to go.''

BEAR STEARNS AGREES TO SETTLE SEC FRAUD CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bear Stearns Cos. has agreed in principle to settle Securities
and Exchange Commission securities fraud charges in connection with
the firm's role as the clearing broker for A.R. Baron, a New York
brokerage firm that failed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing submitted to the SEC Monday, Bear Stearns said that
if the settlement was approved by the commission, it would pay a
fine of $5 million to the SEC and make further payments of $20
million to a fund to settle private lawsuits brought by individual
investors who lost money with A.R. Baron.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is approved, the $25 million that Bear Stearns has
agreed to pay would be among the top tier of monetary settlements
ever reached by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the commission nor Bear Stearns would comment on the
settlement or its details Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns has been the subject of an SEC investigation for
two years into the firm's role in the failure of A.R. Baron, a firm
for which Bear Stearns provided capital and processed securities
trades. Regulators have been in talks to settle with Bear Stearns
since April. The discussions were fitful until 12 days ago, when
the SEC signaled that it was preparing to sue the brokerage house.
</P>
<P>
   Until the settlement is approved, there are no details regarding
what violations Bear Stearns may have committed in its conduct in
the A.R. Baron matter, how the $20 million restitution fund will be
administered and what new procedures must be instituted by Bear
Stearns to prevent future violations among its clearing customer
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the settlement address the future of Richard
Harriton, the president of the clearing subsidiary, Bear Stearns
Securities Corp. Harriton, who is being represented by his own
lawyer, is conducting separate settlement talks with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Until news of the settlement came out, Bear Stearns had
vigorously denied wrongdoing in the A.R. Baron matter and defended
Harriton. In recent weeks, however, its defense of Harriton has
become less spirited.
</P>
<P>
   Although the terms of Monday's deal remain confidential, the SEC
may charge that Bear Stearns violated securities laws in connection
with A.R. Baron, either through its own actions or by assisting the
actions of others. Also at issue is that although A.R. Baron's net
capital had fallen below regulatory requirements, Bear Stearns'
assistance allowed Baron to keep operating.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to settle with the SEC, Bear Stearns would neither
admit nor deny the accusations of securities fraud. It would,
though, sign a ``cease and desist'' order. In its filing, Bear
Stearns said the settlement would have no material effect on the
company's business or its financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement with the SEC does not mean the end of the
investigations into Bear Stearns' lucrative clearing subsidiary.
The company remains under investigation by Robert Morgenthau, the
Manhattan district attorney, who prosecuted the Baron case and won
13 convictions against executives and brokers of the firm.
Investors lost $75 million when A.R. Baron failed.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns is also under investigation by the U.S. attorney
for the Southern District of New York for the firm's role as
clearing broker for Sterling Foster, a defunct New York brokerage
house. Sterling Foster and several executives were indicted for
securities fraud by a grand jury in the Southern District last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that the firm manipulated the stocks of six
small companies underwritten by Sterling Foster in the mid-1990s
and that the firm was secretly controlled by Randolph Pace, a
former principal of Rooney Pace, a brokerage firm expelled by
regulators in 1987. Pace had been barred from operating in the
securities industry.

A STRONG DOLLARS MEANS SAVINGS IN EUROPE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pack up and get going. Europe is cheap. And don't be troubled by
the new single currency, the euro. Think in marks, francs, lire,
pesetas and escudos and you will see what a bargain the continent
is.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with last summer, if the dollar stays where it is now,
travel on the continent should cost 4 percent to 5 percent less,
based on the shift in the exchange rate and assuming local prices
have not risen. In some countries, like Italy, the dollar has not
been able to buy as many lire since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   A double room with spa treatments and meals at La Reserve in
Caramanico, Italy, near Pescara, costs $242 a person a night, down
14 percent from last October, when the dollar was at its recent low
against the lira.
</P>
<P>
   The muscular dollar is a result of two forces: the continued
strength of the American economy and the surprising weakness in
continental Europe, especially in the region's biggest economy,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   And there are analysts who think the dollar's strength will last
long enough to make traveling this summer even more attractive.
``We expect the dollar to continue to rally,'' said Jeremy P. Fand,
senior foreign-exchange strategist at BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, Portugal and Spain, the dollar has not been as strong
as it is now since the end of 1985, its high point against European
currencies since the early 1970s, when fixed exchange rates were
abandoned. At the end of last month, the dollar fetched 1,866 lire,
beating the 1997 high of 1,839.50 and not all that far from the
1,900 to 2,000 lire to the dollar a tourist could get in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, France, Ireland, Belgium, Austria and the
Netherlands the dollar is on the verge of buying more currency than
it has since 1989, when it began a swoon that would take it to post
World War II lows by 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 1.900 German marks and 6.373 French francs in
early June, the most since the fall of 1989. The dollar has slipped
a little since, but it will take only a small rally to reclaim 1989
highs.
</P>
<P>
   So much attention has been paid to the surprising weakness of
the new euro that the extent of the benefits for the American
traveler has been missed.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, which was introduced in January, has plunged 11
percent to $1.037. And each slip has made the dollar's historical
strength against the old currencies greater.
</P>
<P>
   But this rally should be kept in context. Even in Italy,
Portugal and Spain, where the dollar is at 14-year highs, it is
still only 1.4 percent stronger than it was at its recent high in
1997. So if you were in Europe that year, the savings may not seem
as fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   When you take advantage of the stronger dollar, you will get
most of the breaks in the old currencies. While the euro is the
single currency now of Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands,
Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Finland and Luxembourg,
the new euro bills and coins do not begin to circulate until the
beginning of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   So when you are getting cash or paying in cash, it will still be
the old currencies. Prices will be listed in the old currencies
and, in some cases, also the new euro.
</P>
<P>
   Your credit card, however, will be charged in euros, but that
should not create any difficulties because the charges will be
translated into dollars when you get your bill, and you will spend
the same number of dollars for something priced in euros or the old
local currency.
</P>
<P>
   But when you are choosing between using cash or your credit
card, you can think like a foreign-exchange trader. If you want to
bet that the dollar rally is going to continue, it is better to use
your credit card. Because it takes time for the charge to go
through, if the dollar is rallying you will get a better exchange
rate. If you use cash, you are locking in the exchange rate right
then.
</P>
<P>
   And when you leave Euroland (the name for the countries joined
by the new euro), the dollar story is different.
</P>
<P>
   While the dollar rally is also making London cheaper this summer
(about 3 percent), the American currency has been in a general down
trend against the British pound since 1994. This summer it costs
almost 3 percent more to stay in a hotel in London, based on the
exchange rate difference, than it did in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, the dollar has just rallied back to the level of
last summer. But the jump in value _ 17 percent _ since the
dollar's low in October 1998 is the strongest of any major European
currency. So for anyone who planned their summer in Switzerland
last winter, it will cost a lot less.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Almost four weeks before Coca Cola Co.
publicly acknowledged the contamination in Belgium that led to the
biggest recall in its 113-year history, four people had become sick
at a bar near Antwerp and blamed their illness on drinking Coke, a
senior Belgian health ministry official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The first the public in general knew of the scare, which
eventually led to a total, 10-day ban on Coca-Cola products in
Belgium and spread alarms across Europe, was on June 8 after more
than 30 teen-age schoolchildren in the town of Bornem were taken to
the hospital complaining of stomachaches, dizziness and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   But, the health ministry official said, that incident had been
preceded on May 12 when the owner of a bar at Noorderwijk, a tiny
village 20 miles east of Antwerp, called both the Ministry of
Public Health and Coca-Cola Co.'s staff in Belgium to say four
adults had displayed similar symptoms after drinking Coke. As in
other cases, the four people complained that the Coke they drank
smelled strange. Neither the company nor the Belgian authorities
had alluded to the earlier incident in their accounts of the
recall. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Coca-Cola at the company's Atlanta headquarters
said the company had checked out the May 12 incident and had found
no reason to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was found in the plant, so it was thought to be an
anomaly,'' said the spokesman, Randy Donaldson. As for why the
company had not mentioned it as more recent reports of problems
with Coca-Cola products emerged, he said it was not clear that the
incidents were connected, even though the same plant in Antwerp was
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Noorderwijk case provides a fuller picture of
the sequence of events surrounding Coca-Cola Co.'s handling of an
affair that, by the company's own admission, has hurt its
reputation and has drawn public apologies from the company's chief
executive, M. Douglas Ivester. Coinciding with a food scandal in
Belgium over the contamination of meat and poultry with
cancer-causing dioxin, it illustrated anew why many Belgians have
become nervous about the safety of the food they buy in stores.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, the Belgian official said, the incident at
Noorderwijk seemed like an isolated incident. The Coke drunk by the
adults had been packaged in small bottles by a Coke plant in
Antwerp _ like those sold to schoolchildren in Bornem _ and,
afterwards, the four people complained of stomachaches, dizziness
and a burning sensation in the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Three of them were examined in a hospital, ``but the doctor
could not find anything,'' the official said. Samples of Coke from
the same batch were sent for analysis to a government-licensed
laboratory, and Coca-Cola was also believed to have ordered tests
on the same batch, the official said. But ``because it was one
case, because nothing was found in the laboratory, no action was
taken,'' this official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not find any poison. There was no proof that it was
linked to Coca-Cola,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   With hindsight, however, the official's account seemed to
suggest that the scare may have been building slowly in Belgium for
weeks before it blew up into a major embarrassment and marketing
disaster for the company. But, at a time when government officials
were preoccupied with the dioxin scandal _ and only weeks before
elections June 13 that brought down the government _ it appears
that the incident at Noorderwijk was simply filed away.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week, Ivester said laboratory tests
had found traces of sulfur in the carbon dioxide used to make
bubbles in sodas and had discovered that cans of Coke imported from
Dunkirk, France, had been contaminated by a chemical used on
transportation pallets. He blamed these factors for the 249 cases
of Coke-related sickness reported to the Belgian authorities. But
the Belgian minister in charge of the case, Luc Van den Bossche,
said the government did not accept this explanation, arguing that
the concentrations of the chemicals identified by Ivester were too
low to cause illness.
</P>
<P>
   The sicknesses among teen-age students in Bornem, also near
Antwerp, were the first reported of a series in other parts of
Belgium, including Bruges, Harelbeke and Lochristi. On June 14, the
government issued a highly unusual ministerial decree banning a
range of Coca-Cola products from sodas to mineral water. The ban
was eased June 17 and totally lifted June 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian health official said that, once Coca-Cola had begun
to recall its products in Belgium, several people contacted an
emergency call center to say that, for ``one or two months,'' they
had detected strange smells from some new vending machines
installed by Coke. Thousands of Coke vending machines in Belgium
remained off limits when the overall ban was lifted last Thursday
and there has been no word on when they will reopen. The smell has
been described by some of those who became sick as being like
gasoline or sulfur.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian official said that two Coca-Cola plants closed
during the ban _ at Ghent and Antwerp _ were near reopening or
already had reopened after inspections by government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian officials said the bulk of the illnesses appeared to
have been linked most to sodas produced in early June. But, despite
the easing of the restrictions, the health ministry official
insisted that the cause of the sicknesses remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been given proof of contamination, but we haven't been
given proof of the link between contamination and the symptoms,''
the official said.

MEDICARE PATIENTS TO GET UP TO $2,500 FOR DRUGS UNDER CLINTON
PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Medicare beneficiary could eventually get up to
$2,500 a year in federal money to help buy prescription drugs under
President Clinton's proposal to expand the health insurance program
for the elderly and disabled, administration officials said on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised Medicare coverage of prescription drugs in his
State of the Union Message on Jan. 19. But administration officials
were still working out the last details on Monday evening, just a
day before Clinton plans to unveil the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Drug benefits are one element of a comprehensive plan that
Clinton has devised to modernize Medicare and strengthen its
financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing a windfall of new federal revenue, Clinton said on
Monday that he wanted to shore up Medicare with $794 billion of
federal budget surpluses over the next 15 years. Medicare would
thus get 15 percent of the anticipated surpluses, enough to keep it
solvent until at least 2025, a decade longer than expected under
current law.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, administration officials have analyzed dozens
of options for Medicare coverage of prescription drugs, with
different costs and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   They said on Monday night that they had tentatively settled on
these details: The premium for drug coverage would start at about
$24 a month, then climb gradually in subsequent years to about $44
a month. Under the plan, the government would pay half the cost of
prescription drugs, up to a certain level to be specified by law,
and beneficiaries would pay the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum federal payment for prescription drugs would
initially be $1,000 a year, rising gradually to $2,500 a year. The
transition would probably occur over six years. But White House
documents show a question mark alongside this number, indicating
that the transition could be different in the final proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the National Academy of Social Insurance said
only 4 percent of beneficiaries had drug expenses exceeding $2,000
a year. (The figures do not include spending for people in
hospitals, nursing homes or health maintenance organizations.)
</P>
<P>
   The president will also propose an increase in the deductible
amount that Medicare beneficiaries must pay for doctors' services,
laboratory tests and outpatient hospital visits, administration
officials said. The amount has been fixed by law at $100 a year
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's plan, the deductible would be
automatically increased each year to reflect increases in prices.
Officials said they believed that Clinton would propose linking the
deductible to consumer prices, not to medical prices, which are
expected to rise faster.
</P>
<P>
   A change in the deductible would affect at least 75 percent of
the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Clinton would propose extremely
modest relief for health care providers who have been complaining
about cuts in their Medicare payments. The administration will ask
Congress to establish a special fund for this purpose, with less
than $10 billion over 10 years _ a small fraction of the amount cut
by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will work with Congress to decide who should
get the money. Doctors, hospitals, nursing homes and home health
care agencies all want it. Administration officials said Congress
should restore money only if there is firm evidence that the cuts
have harmed the quality of care or impaired patients' access to
care.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the design of the president's
prescription drug proposal had been heavily influenced by politics.
Clinton, they said, wanted to provide some tangible benefit to a
large number of people, rather than helping a small number with
very high drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the president does not propose any limit on how much a
sick person might have to pay for drugs. If Congress approved the
president's plan, the government would pay $2,500, or half of the
cost, for a person who incurred $5,000 of drug expenses in a year.
The government would pay the same $2,500 for a person who ran up,
say, $10,000 of drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's proposal, anyone who voluntarily paid the
extra premium for drug coverage could get some financial benefit
from it as soon as the person walked into a pharmacy and filled a
prescription.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they tried to keep the premium low so
that large numbers of people would sign up for drug coverage under
Medicare. In particular, they wanted to attract large numbers of
healthy people whose premiums would help pay the costs incurred by
sick people.

COMMENTARY: THIS IS THE BIG ONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Memo to: President Mohammad Khatami of Iran &AMP; Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji of China From: President William J. Clinton
</P>
<P>
   Dear Gentlemen, I am writing to you both because though you may
not know it, you share the same problem, a serious problem, which
if not addressed effectively will become my problem. Quite simply,
you are both facing the biggest challenge ever from your domestic
opponents. This is the Big One for both of you. You run from this
challenge and your aspirations for your respective countries will
be squashed. It's that simple.
</P>
<P>
   President Khatami, let's start with you. Your hardline opponents
have ginned up this bogus allegation that 13 Iranian Jews have been
spying for Israel. We both know Israel would never be so crazy as
to use the tiny Jewish minority in Iran to do its spying. But we
also know why your opponents seized on this canard _ because it
puts you in an impossible position. If you defend these Iranian
Jews, your opponents will denounce you for protecting ``Zionist
agents''; and if you don't release them, and, God forbid, they are
executed, your whole strategy of improving Iran's relations with
the West _ beginning first with Western Europe and then with the
United States _ will be aborted.
</P>
<P>
   And let me assure you, if you kill these 13 Jews, Iran will be
treated as a pariah state like you've never seen. You and Slobodan
Milosevic and Saddam Hussein will be vacationing together for the
rest of your lives.
</P>
<P>
   We both know why this came up now. Iran will be holding its
parliamentary elections in March. President Khatami, you trounced
your opponents in the presidential election last year, winning 70
percent of the vote. But the hard-liners still control the
Parliament, the judiciary, the Revolutionary Guards and the
Intelligence Directorate. If you can win the Parliament in March,
your opponents will really be on the run, so they are using this
case to undermine you before the March runoff. But you still have
the mass base with you, and you need to rally them, in the streets
if need be, against those who want to use this spying case to cut
off Iran from the world. Tell the prosecutors that if there is
evidence of spying they must show it to the world. If not, Islamic
justice requires that the accused be set free.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Zhu, the same goes for you. You know we bombed
your embassy in Belgrade by accident. And you know your domestic
opponents are keeping this thing alive to undermine all of those in
China who want to integrate with the world and with the United
States. I know you need to let off steam, but the steam can also
blow you away. When I read your recent Peoples Daily editorial
comparing the United States with ``Nazi Germany,'' it said to me
that your opponents are trying to stir up a level of
anti-Americanism not seen since the Cultural Revolution. And they
are doing it to make it impossible for you to make the concessions
needed for China to join the World Trade Organization _ which would
impose a set of global rules on China's trading practices that your
corrupt opponents have no interest in. I know you also have people
who sincerely want to restore the walls around China, to free it
from American domination and influence.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu, there is no future in Chinese isolationism, and if you
don't take a stand against your opponents, if you are unable to
mobilize President Jiang and China's elites to complete this WTO
deal (you've stopped even returning our negotiators' phone calls),
you will never be able to accelerate economic reform as you aspire,
let alone attract sufficient foreign investment or participate in
the setting of global trading rules.
</P>
<P>
   I know what I am asking you means I've got to confront my own
domestic opponents, too. Zhu, you have my word that once you join
the WTO. I will bring China into the G-8 and make it the G-9, and
this time I won't shrink from getting Congress to ratify your WTO
membership. Mohammad, let me remind you again: the door is open for
normal relations between America and Iran. Yes, I am ready to lift
the sanctions on Iran and to take the measures that you have long
called for, such as settling outstanding financial claims. But I'm
not going to lift a finger for a rogue state that won't renounce
terrorism and kills innocent Jews. Like I said, guys, this is the
Big One for both of you. You run away from these challenges, you
turn the other cheek, you balk, you blink, you're finished.

public, behind a floor-to-ceiling glass wall.

<P>
   Francis Scott Key saw the flag still waving after Fort McHenry
repulsed an attack on Baltimore by the British during the War of
1812, inspiring him to write the poem that was later set to music
as the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   The flag, which came to the museum in 1907, has undergone two
previous conservation treatments in 1914 and in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   During the three years that it will take to clean the flag,
visitors to the museum will be able to watch as a squad of textile
conservation experts leans from a gantry to snip away the stitches
that bind the 30-by-34-foot flag to a linen backing; they will then
remove decades of dirt from the woolen fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The National Museum of American History, on the Mall in
Washington, is open daily 10 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. during the summer.
Free same-day passes to watch the flag cleaning (a limit of six a
person) are issued at 10 a.m. on a first-come first-served basis.
After 5:30 p.m. passes are not required.
</P>
<P>
   Passes are available in advance from Ticketmaster, (800)
551-7328, for a fee of $2.50 for each pass and a handling fee of $1
for each order.

   Hemingway Hometown Celebrates a Centennial &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For decades there was no love lost between Ernest Hemingway and
his hometown of Oak Park, Ill., just west of Chicago. The town,
then stodgy and straitlaced, snubbed the swashbuckling adventurer,
and Hemingway, in turn, lampooned Oak Park as a village of ``broad
lawns and narrow minds.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in the last 20 years, that has changed, and Oak Park is now
a sophisticated, arts-friendly suburb. And this summer, in honor of
Hemingway's 100th birthday on July 21, the Ernest Hemingway
Foundation of Oak Park is staging a weeklong event with everything
from a literary conference to a ``running of the bulls.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ernest Hemingway Centennial Birthday Celebration will run
from July 14 through 21, and is designed both for aficionados of
``The Sun Also Rises'' and children more interested in, say, sword
fighting. Some events will include Hemingway's three sons, Patrick,
Jack and Gregory. Patrick edited his father's novel, ``True at
First Light,'' to be published on July 21.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From 5 to 7 p.m. on each day of the festival, a free Humanities
Festival will feature music, dance and art exhibits. There will be
two screenings of a Cuban film, ``Hello Hemingway,'' about a girl's
fruitless search to meet the author. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From July 16 to 18 will be the Fiesta de Hemingway, an outdoor
festival with flamenco dancing, a swing dance competition, Spanish
and Latin food prepared from recipes in ``The Hemingway Cookbook,''
and a Hemingway look-alike contest. On July 17, there will be a
fiesta parade and a running of papier-mache bulls on wheels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oak Park's Hemingway Museum will unveil a new exhibit of
photographs and memorabilia, and nightly performances of ``It Just
Catches,'' a dramatic adaptation of three Hemingway short stories,
written by his daughter-in-law, Carol, will be presented July 18 to
21. Tickets are $18.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An International Literary Conference, featuring renowned
Hemingway scholars, will be July 19 to 21. Cost: $125, $75 for
students. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contact the Hemingway Foundation, (708) 848-2222, or the Oak
Park Visitors Bureau, (708) 524-7800. The foundation Web site is

   A Millet Revival In Massachusetts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh, for one, loved the work of Millet, the 19th century
French painter of peasant life and labor. He declared Millet his
``father'' and ``eternal master,'' and used his works to assist his
early drawing efforts. But as the modernist star rose over the last
50 years, Millet fell out of favor in the art world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Millet is back. This summer Sterling and Francine Clark Art
Institute in Williamstown, Mass., is presenting ``Jean-Francois
Millet: Drawn Into the Light.'' With 80 works from more than two
dozen private and public collections, it is the largest showing of
Millet in the United States in years (and it follows a popular
exhibition called ``Millet/van Gogh'' in Paris last year). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the paintings on view will be Millet's most famous work,
the harvest scene ``The Gleaners,'' in a rare loan from the Musee
d'Orsay in Paris. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Millet was a great draftsman, as van Gogh knew, and the
exhibition includes many pastels and drawings, too. It is arranged
thematically, with well-known paintings like ``The Sower'' and
``Man with a Hoe'' hung alongside related drawings and pastels to
show how Millet refined his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The works also remind viewers that Millet, as a peasant's son
who once worked the land, did not idealize farm life. Nor did he
ignore it, in contrast to artists who considered the peasants'
lives too lowly to be recorded. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Drawn Into the Light'' will remain on view at the Clark until
Sept. 6, and then will travel to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam
(Oct. 26 to Jan. 5, 2000) and to the Frick Art and Historical
Center in Pittsburgh (Feb. 10 to April 23, 2000). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Clark Art Institute, half a mile south of the intersection
of Routes 2 and 7 in Williamstown, is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5
p.m., until 8 p.m. on Tuesday, through August.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $5, except Tuesdays, which are free. Information:
(413) 458-9545. &QL;

   High-Tech Meets Low-Tech in Two New Coasters &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The retro look has hit the world of roller coasters in a big
way. Two monster-sized coasters, each built of old-fashioned wood
but designed using the latest in computer technology, have recently
opened in California and Florida. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo, Calif., 30 miles northeast
of San Francisco, a coaster called Roar is a 10-story-tall,
single-track contraption that features 17 turns, 12 points of
weightlessness, a 60-degree banked turn taken at 50 miles an hour,
and a dozen drops, including a 180-degree spiral. Its 625,000 board
feet are held together by 500,000 nails, washers and nuts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Florida ride, at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, is a double-track
dueling coaster called Gwazi. Its two trains race each other on two
different tracks that start parallel and then diverge on 15
towering hills, a dozen hard-angle turns (all at speeds of up to 50
miles an hour) and six hair-raising flybys _ points at which the
trains pass each other going opposite directions. Over one million
board feet of lumber were used to build the coaster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Six Flags Marine World is at 2001 Marine World Parkway, Vallejo,
(707) 643-6722; $30.99; $20.99 children over 48 inches, $15.50
children 48 inches and under. Busch Gardens Tampa Bay is at 3000
East Busch Boulevard, (813) 987-5082; $46.95; $37.35 children.

COURT SAYS GOVERNMENT WAS WRONG TO DENY COMMISSION MEMBER
INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore and other top officials
invited the widow of a passenger on the Pan Am flight bombed over
Lockerbie, Scotland, to join an advisory commission on aviation
security, then elbowed her aside and denied her information
available to the other members, a federal appeals court has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was formed after the explosion that destroyed TWA
Flight 800 off Long Island three years ago, and called for security
changes. But the widow, M. Victoria Cummock, was the only one of
the 21 members who complained that many of the recommendations were
vague.
</P>
<P>
   The commission published only part of her dissent in its report,
along with an editor's note that said that the commission had
rejected some of her ideas and had not had time to consider others.
Ms. Cummock sued, and the court, in its decision, said the editor's
note was misleading.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has nearly 1,000 advisory commissions,
with more than 36,000 members. Individuals or groups often sue,
contending that the membership is one-sided, but several lawyers in
Washington said Monday that they could not recall a suit by a
member of a commission.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, by a three-judge panel, says that commission
members have rights beyond those of the general public to view
government information in the commission's subject area.
</P>
<P>
   The court told a lower court to determine what documents Ms.
Cummock had been denied and provide them to her, and give her an
opportunity to update her dissent. The government uses such
commissions to obtain ``political legitimacy'' for its policy
decisions, the court said, and must afford its members an equal
basis to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Haungs, Ms. Cummock's lawyer, summarized his client's
case as saying, ``you put me on commission but tried to make me a
potted plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cummock said in a telephone interview that she believed the
commission had submitted a classified report to the president, with
her name listed among the endorsers, but that she had never seen
it. The commission was formed, she said, by ``spin doctors who were
trying to calm the waters,'' in the period after the TWA 800 crash,
which was widely believed at first to have been caused by a bomb or
missile.
</P>
<P>
   William Schulz, a spokesman for the Transportation Department,
said that his agency had not decided how to respond to the
decision.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON TRAVEL

<P>
   Q. I wish to visit the Isles of Scilly, in Britain, in the early
autumn. How do I get there, and what about accommodations and
sightseeing? _ Thomas Chiu, Hartsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Isles of Scilly (pronounced silly) may sound as if they
are inhabited by the Monty Python crew, but this archipelago of 45
islands that is 28 miles southwest of Land's End has a history
dating from the Bronze and Iron Ages.
</P>
<P>
   The largest island (about two miles wide) is St. Mary's, where
all but a few hundred of the 2,000 or so Scillonians live. It is
the access point for most transportation from Britain, and for
boats to the other islands.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, St. Mary's is popular for its beaches and its
Friday-evening gig races _ contests among six-oared boats about 30
feet long. In October, bird-watchers alight here to see migratory
species.
</P>
<P>
   The museum in Hugh Town contains a collection of treasures from
shipwrecks, which were a frequent calamity in this area. You can
walk or take a bus to other sights, including Old Town, with a 19th
century church and the remains of a fort from Henry VIII's reign.
Bants Carn is a third century B.C. stone burial chamber and an Iron
Age village.
</P>
<P>
   Tresco, the second largest island, is famous for its 12-acre
Abbey Gardens and Valhalla, a museum with about 50 figureheads and
other carvings from shipwrecks. The other inhabited islands _
Bryher, St. Agnes and St. Martin's _ are notable for dramatic views
of the sea and rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Scillonian III ferry operates out of Penzance from late
March through October. It leaves at 9:15 a.m. Monday to Saturday
for the two and a half hour trip to St. Mary's, and returns at 4:30
p.m.; in October trips are Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.
Day-trip fares in the off-season, when you plan to go, are $48
round trip, $24 for children (at $1.60 to the pound); excursion
fares for one to three nights are $67, $34 children; reservations
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   There are flights to St. Mary's from Land's End, Bristol,
Plymouth, Newquay and Exeter on Skybus Airlines. The shortest _ 15
minutes _ is from Land's End, and they leave frequently every day
except Sunday (when there are no boats or flights to the islands).
Off-season fares are $135 round trip, or $89 for excursion fares.
For the ferry and the plane, call (44-1736) 362 009. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's has six hotels. The Star Castle, (44-1720) 422 317,
is in the Garrison, built for Elizabeth I's troops. It has 34 rooms
and is open March through October (as are most Scilly hotels).
Rates are $108 to $157 a person, with breakfast and dinner. There's
also the Bell Rock Hotel, (44-1720) 422 575, 23 rooms, open March
through October, with rates of $43 to $92 a person with breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The island also has many guesthouses. For a listing, contact
Scilly Isles Tourist Information Center, Old Wesleyan Chapel, St.
Mary's, Isles of Scilly TR21 0JY; telephone (44-1720) 422 536, fax
(44-1720) 422 049. &QL; 
Quebec to Maine &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm planning a driving trip from Quebec City to Portland,
Maine Can you suggest some stops along the way? I plan to allow
three days. _ Ira Briskman, Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. This drive allows you to combine fairly quick travel with
lots to see. The first 137 miles of your 300-mile route will pass
through a region of Quebec known as the Beauce, with farmland and
maple groves.
</P>
<P>
   You'll follow the Chaudiere River (Route 173 and Route 204)
until you reach its headwaters in Lake Megantic. The sites you will
pass include the Chaudiere Falls, a 130-foot cascade just south of
Quebec City. Farther on is Notre-Dame-des-Pins, with a 507-foot
covered bridge dating from 1929, and St. Georges, with its
three-spired church on the river. Lake Megantic, covering about 10
square miles, is a good spot for scenic cruises. A few miles away,
a drive up Mount Megantic (3,625 feet) offers panoramic views.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to backtrack several miles to Route 173, which feeds
into U.S. 201 in Maine. It will take you past Skowhegan, along the
Kennebec River, where you might want to see the Margaret Chase
Smith Library, (207) 474-7133, with displays about the woman who
served the state in Congress for almost 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the quickest way to Portland is I-95, which passes
by the state capital, Augusta, with the Maine State Museum, (207)
287-2301, which has exhibits on the state's natural and economic
history. If you take I-495 toward Portland, you'll go by Sabbathday
Lake, where there is a Shaker museum, (207) 926-4597. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you tell me about tours to biblical sites in Cyprus? I am
especially interested in Salamis, Larnaca and Paphos, because of
their connections, respectively, to St. Barnabas, St. Lazarus and
St. Paul. _ Edith Sagul, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Two of those places _ Larnaca and Paphos _ are on the part of
Cyprus controlled by the Republic of Cyprus, the internationally
recognized government on the Mediterranean island, and are part of
many tours.
</P>
<P>
   Larnaca is the site of St. Lazarus Church, built in the 9th
century and restored in the 17th. Lazarus, whom Christians believe
was raised from the dead by Jesus, is the city's patron saint.
After his resurrection, he lived there for another 30 years and was
ordained a bishop by St. Barnabas and St. Mark, and his sarcophagus
is in the church. In Paphos, there's the Pillar of St. Paul.
According to legend, the saint was bound to this pillar and given
39 lashes before converting the Roman governor.
</P>
<P>
   Salamis _ the birthplace of St. Barnabas _ will be more
difficult for you to see. It is on the part of the island invaded
by Turkey in 1974, an area that encompasses the northern third of
Cyprus and that is separated from the Republic of Cyprus by a
United Nations buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Republic of Cyprus does not allow visitors to enter or leave
its section of the island from the Turkish side, according to the
State Department, but does allow some strictly controlled day trips
into the north. So you might be able to combine all three sites on
one trip, but don't expect to find package tours with all three.
</P>
<P>
   The crossing point into the north is near the Ledra Palace Hotel
in Nicosia; the United States Embassy in Nicosia, telephone (357-2)
776400, can bring you up to date on whether you can cross. You will
have to arrange getting to Salamis on your own, so be sure your
tour includes a free day in Nicosia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cyprus Tourism Organization, 13 East 40th Street, New York,
N.Y. 10016, (212) 683-5280, can supply a list of numerous tour
operators with packages to the Republic of Cyprus.

 By SUSAN SACHS and JASON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alone in the world but for the father he had never
seen, a determined 13-year-old boy equipped with a little money and
enough pluck to charm a string of helpful strangers, set out for
New York City from his hurricane-devastated village in Honduras
last month to find his father.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Edwin Daniel Sabillon, carrying a paper bag with a
change of clothes, his birth certificate and three cookies, arrived
on a bus from Miami on Sunday. With the aplomb that carried him
through his 3,200-mile journey, he hailed a cab and went looking
for his father.
</P>
<P>
   He did not find him. But the police, who picked the boy up after
being alerted by the concerned taxi driver, said Monday that they
will take up Edwin's search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary concern is that he is reunited with his father,''
said Capt. Thomas Kelly, of the Bronx Detectives.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin, he added, has nothing to worry about. Although he entered
the country illegally, the boy's story has touched the
highest-ranking heart in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's under the protective custody of the mayor's office,''
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the youngster is in the hands of the city's
Administration for Childrens Services, which Monday was arranging
for him to spend the night with a Spanish-speaking foster family
while the police continued to hunt for his father.
</P>
<P>
   The father was identified as Grevi Sabillon Vasquez. Detectives
said they do not know what the father does, where in the city he
lives, or whether he is a legal or illegal immigrant. What they do
know about him comes, essentially, from the bits and pieces of
information they gleaned from Edwin.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said he wrote to his father last year, after Hurricane
Mitch roared through Honduras and wrecked his home in Colonia San
Miguel, a suburb of the capital Tegucigalpa. A mudslide, apparently
triggered by the torrential rains of the storm, had killed his
mother, Angela Enamorado, and his 14-year-old brother, Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the father wrote back. As recounted by the police,
who read the letter, he instructed the boy to come to New York
City. He said he would meet him at the entrance to LaGuardia
Airport. He gave three rendezvous dates: June 25, 26 and 27. I will
be wearing a white shirt, black pants, white sneakers and a black
hat, the father wrote, but I will recognize you.
</P>
<P>
   Then the father sent $200 by wire to Honduras and on May 22,
Edwin left the house of friends in San Francisco de Yojoa Cortez,
and set out on a journey that would take him 37 days.
</P>
<P>
   The adventures along the way that he recounted to detectives
sound like the Huckleberry Finn tale in reverse: A stubborn boy
sets out on the road to join his father, steals across the borders
of three countries, gives the slip to lawmen along the way, loses
his possessions and gets rescued by a succession of good
Samaritans.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it is also an improbable tale of luck and
generosity along a route that most often is paved with hardship and
greed.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin said he hitchhiked up the Honduran coast through Guatemala
and into Mexico. In Matamoros, a town bordering Texas, he said he
won the sympathy of smugglers who agreed to arrange his passage for
free. The normal price for the often hazardous and sometimes deadly
journey is $5,000, according to lawyers who work with Central
American immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   According to the boy's account, he then found a ride to Houston
and then, inexplicably, went to Miami. Somewhere along the way, he
lost his wallet with most of the money his father had sent him and
the slip of paper on which he had written his father's address.
</P>
<P>
   But his luck held. In Miami, he found his way to the Natasha
Cafeteria, where the Cuban-American owner and his patrons took the
boy in blue jeans and a yellow T-shirt into their embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a five-dollar bill in his hand and he was asking for
change _ four dollars in quarters to take a bus to take him to I-95
North to see how he could get to New York,'' recalled Emilio Jose
Jimenez, who was in the cafeteria last Saturday when Edwin turned
up.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, he said, seemed educated and well-mannered. The
customers took up a collection to buy him an $87 bus ticket so
Edwin would not have to hitchhike, gave him pocket money for food,
took him to the bus station, and bade him goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin arrived in New York City at about 2 p.m. on Sunday. The
police said he got off the bus at 177th Street and Broadway and
then did what most newcomers do: He gaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's walking around, he's amazed by the tall buildings, all
the hustle and bustle, where's the countryside,'' said Det. Gilbert
Ramirez, recounting how the boy described his first hours in the
new city.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Edwin was spotted by Jose Basora, a 35-year-old
taxi driver who emigrated from the Dominican Republic 10 years ago.
At first, Basora said, he thought Edwin was one of the battalion of
young boys who sell flowers in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him looking at me, he was smiling, he was happy,''
Basora recalled. ``Then he came to me and asked me if I can take
him to the airport and how much it would be. I found this strange
because he was a little boy. The light turned green, I told him to
get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwin soon told him of his search for his father. Basora, moved
by the story, drove him around the edges of the airport for 15
minutes, trying various entrances. When he could find no sign of
the father, who had not specified a time for his son to meet him,
the two drove to Basora's home in the Bronx.

TENSIONS SIMMER AROUND A BLACK SECT IN GEORGIA
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By TOM LASSETER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EATONTON, Ga. _ When members of a black religious group moved
here from Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1993, their purchase of 438 acres of
pasture about 10 miles outside of town stirred up gossip and some
apprehension, but residents were more curious than frightened.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, with the completion of a 40-foot black
pyramid on the land that belonged to the group, which is known as
the Yamassee Native American Nuwaubians, most neighbors in this
small dairy-farming town east of Atlanta scratched their heads and
figured it would be best to keep their distance.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, when the Nuwaubians declared themselves a separate
nation and began issuing passports and organizing armed security
patrols of their property, Sheriff Howard Sills of Putnam County
decided to take a closer look. A copy of a 1993 FBI report he
received, linking the Nuwaubians' New York operations to welfare
fraud and extortion, also concerned him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Sills learned that the group's spiritual leader, Dwight
York, was a convicted felon. York has admitted he served three
years in prison in the 1960s for resisting arrest, assault and
possession of a dangerous weapon.
</P>
<P>
   He is known among the Nuwaubians as the Master Teacher Dr.
Malachi York, who founded the Nuwaubians sect on a combination of
Islamic, Christian and Hebrew teachings. York says he is an
extraterrestrial being from the galaxy Illyuwn. He and many in his
group say they expect a spacecraft from Illyuwn to visit Earth in
2003. The craft, they say, will take with it 144,000 chosen people,
a number they do not explain.
</P>
<P>
   The front of the compound, which Nuwaubians refer to as the
``Egypt of the West,'' contains eight-foot statues of Egyptian gods
and goddesses placed among columns covered with hieroglyphics, and
a sphinx and several smaller pyramids about 24 feet in height.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the last days and we Nuwaubians have created God's
kingdom right here on Earth,'' said Marshall Chance Jr., president
of the group's Holy Tabernacle Industries.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities between the Nuwaubians and the 39 members of
the Heaven's Gate sect in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., who committed
mass suicide in March 1997, were too close to ignore, Sills said.
The Heaven's Gate group, like the Nuwaubians, said they believed a
spacecraft would come to save them. There are at least 150 people
living on the Nuwaubian property.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Putnam County authorities and the Nuwaubians
have steadily increased in the last two years. In the last few
months, there have been several standoffs between Nuwaubian guards
and the sheriff's department, when deputies were barred from the
property. In April, for example, when Sills attempted to deliver a
court order concerning zoning violations, two Nuwaubian guards,
wearing 9-millimeter pistols on their hips, stood in front of his
car and would not let it pass, Sills said.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontations stem in part from three county lawsuits filed
in the last year against the Nuwaubians, charging the group with
zoning violations and violations of building regulations. The
Nuwaubians were operating a large nightclub on their land, zoned
for agricultural use, and were planning to open, among other
businesses, a health-food store, a bar, a recording studio and a
taxicab company.
</P>
<P>
   York refused to appear in court and was ordered to be tried for
contempt of court on Tuesday for not appearing at previous hearings
on zoning violations.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, thousands of Nuwaubian followers drove by the
dairy farms, fruit stands and bait shops of Eatonton to attend the
annual Savior Day's Festival at the Nuwaubian compound, which
celebrated York's birthday on June 26. Because Sills padlocked some
of the compound's buildings, acting on a court order in the zoning
disputes, the festival was held outdoors, in continual rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a utopia,'' said Chance, who wears a priestly black shirt
and pants with a white collar. When asked if he was ordained by any
particular denomination, Chance replied that he was ``ordained and
called by God himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But that sort of religious fervor has raised concerns among
state and federal officials. Department of Justice representatives
from the community dispute resolution offices in Atlanta have been
in Eatonton since Wednesday, trying to bring the county and the
Nuwaubians to the same table to quiet tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict in Putnam County, and its potential for disorder,
even violence led Gov. Roy Barnes to call Sills last week to
discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a bench warrant for York's arrest on contempt of
court charges was withdrawn when York's lawyer promised that he
would appear in court on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an atmosphere of tension,'' said Ernie Stallworth, a
mediator for the Justice Department. ``The Nuwaubians feel they
have been unfairly harassed since they've been down there.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Nuwaubians, Leroy Johnson, said he thought
local, white government officials should be more tolerant of the
group's endeavors, but he acknowledged that predominantly white
Putnam County might not be the most suitable place for a black
religious group to build pyramids.
</P>
<P>
   Driving into Putnam, motorists see signs inviting people to join
the local chapter of Sons of Confederate Veterans and the county
has an annual 10-kilometer race, once known to locals as the Tar
Baby Run in celebration of Joel Chandler Harris, a white native of
Eatonton who wrote a series of Br'er Rabbit folktales.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a realization by the government there that the
situation is a powder keg, where the drop of a hat or a
miscalculated word can incite violence,'' Johnson, a former state
senator, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   At the festival, people from as far as Trinidad and London came
to honor York. Visitors walked the small labyrinth surrounding the
main pyramid, praying with tracts written by York, who has written
at least 200 of them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd were wearing in clerical robes and Egyptian
headdresses, spoke in bits of Nuwabic, a blend of Arabic and
English also invented by York, who appeared briefly on Saturday,
surrounded by five guards and hundreds of admirers.
</P>
<P>
   None of those living on the property, other than a spokeswoman
and Chance, would comment on their organization. Many of the women
had shaved heads, with a single braid on the right side, in honor
of a Mother Nature-like deity.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuwaubians' move from Brooklyn, where the group was known as
both the Holy Tabernacle of the Most High and the Children of
Abraham, Chance said, was driven by rivalries with Islamic
organizations in New York that objected to the group's borrowing of
several Muslim traditions, Chance said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how the group managed to buy its land and finance the
construction, Chance gave a faint smile, and said, ``We attract
people who already have something with them.''

SOARING TAX SURPLUS SPURS DEBATE OVER WHERE TO SPEND THE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Monday said the roaring US
economy would bring $1 trillion more in tax revenues to the
government by 2014 than anticipated only five months ago, and he
proposed devoting the bulk of the windfall to Social Security,
Medicare, and erasing the government's huge public debt.
</P>
<P>
   The unanticipated money is sure to intensify what is already a
heated debate with the Republican-led Congress over what to do with
future budget surpluses _ how much to return to taxpayers, how much
to use to pay off government debt and how much to spend on federal
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The debate could produce major changes in the nation's two
largest domestic programs, Social Security and Medicare. Both
parties say they want to shore up the shaky finances of the
programs, but Clinton also wants to use much of the surplus to help
finance new benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He has already proposed new tax incentives for low- and
middle-income workers to save for retirement in private stock and
bond accounts, which would supplement their Social Security income.
And Tuesday, he will unveil a sweeping Medicare overhaul that
claims to keep the program solvent for an additional 10 years while
giving seniors a signficant new benefit: partial coverage for the
cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the growing surpluse projections, Clinton so far has
offered no help to one ailing sector of the economy _ money-losing
hospitals. In fact, hospitals are wary of the president's new
Medicare plan because it is expected to steer surgeries to a fewer
number of hospitals, which would be asked to cut their prices and
offer volume discounts to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see the administration add money to the system,
not squeeze the system further,'' said Andrew Dreyfus, executive
vice president of the Massachusetts Hospital Association. Under a
1997 law, he said, Medicare is on track to pay less than cost for
many surgeries, and contracting certain hospitals to perform even
more unprofitable operations would cause more financial damage.
``We're still hopeful the administration will restore some of the
cuts made in 1997,'' Dreyfus said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have proposed spending far more than the president
on tax cuts and on defense. Still, early reaction to Clinton's
plans for the larger surplus was warm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us more opportunity to get real Social Security and
Medicare reform done, and tax cuts, if the president wants to get
them done,'' said Michele Davis, spokeswoman for House Majority
Leader Richard Armey, a Texas Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In his announcement Monday, Clinton also made a claim that would
have been unthinkable only three years ago. He said this plan would
boost spending on government programs while buying back all federal
debt held by the public within 15 years _all Treasury bonds, bills
and notes.
</P>
<P>
   Few people think the government would actually eliminate all its
public debt, which is more than half the $5.7 trillion total. The
rest is debt the government owes itself, such as money it has
already spent from Social Security trust funds that must be repaid
to the retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that a president claims to have a plan to wipe out
public debt shows how profoundly the robust economy has changed
government finance.
</P>
<P>
   Only three years ago, someone who made such a claim ``would be
told to go lie down and sleep it off,'' said Henry Aaron, who
studies economic policy at the Brookings Institution. ``The fact
that it's within shouting distance is amazing,'' said Robert Bixby,
policy director at the Concord Coaltion, the group devoted to a
balanced federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced the new budget projections before traveling to
several fund-raisers in New York City. His announcement comes only
days before the Congressional Budget Office is expected to lay out
an even rosier vision of future surpluses. With that, Republican
lawmakers will also release their plan for how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his economic team said the budget surplus next year
will be $142 billion, $25 billion more than was forecast in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Economists generally said the White House predictions, based on
a 2.3 percent annual economic growth rate over the next five years,
appeared to be realistic. The economy is now growing at about 4
percent a year. The projected surplus is bigger because the
government expected the economy to slow down this year but it
hasn't so tax revenues are up.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus is expected to include $5 billion produced by taxes
other than the Social Security payroll tax, the first surplus of
this type in 40 years and a significant political milestone. Both
parties have said that every dollar raised by Social Security taxes
should be devoted to the retirement program. Now, is is clear that
Clinton and lawmakers will have money available from non-Social
Security sources to spend on possible tax cuts or federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative surplus over the next 15 years will be $5.9
trillion, the White House said, about $1.1 trillion more than
anticipated in February.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing how to spend the money, Clinton laid out a 15-year
plan, even though his term ends in 18 months and Congress is now
discussing a budget that lasts only through late 2000. Clinton
proposed spending:
</P>
<P>
   -- $794 billion over 15 years to strengthen Medicare. That is
$108 billion more than he proposed in February, when he released
his fiscal 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said most of that money would be used to
extend the life of the program, which is now expected to become
insolvent in 2015. In announcing his Medicare overhaul, Clinton
will also propose a new competitive bidding system to win discounts
on goods, like wheelchairs, and services, like surgeries. Those
savings would help extend the financial life of Medicare by 10
years, to 2025, and cover the prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   -- $522 billion for discretionary programs, up $41 billion from
his February plan. The money includes $183 billion in additional
defense spending and $183 billion for crime prevention, health
research and several other social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton proposed that $156 billion over 15 years be
devoted to a ``children and education trust fund,'' which consists
of Head Start, after-school programs, Pell grants for low-income
college students and other existing programs.
</P>
<P>
   -- At least $540 billion on tax cuts over 15 years. House
Republicans want a larger tax cut _ as much as $778 billion over 10
years _ and they generally favor broad reductions in the income,
estate and capital gains taxes. Clinton generally favors
``targeted'' cuts to help specific groups, such as people caring
for elderly relatives, parents with child-care costs and low-income
people saving for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also revised his earlier plan for how to improve the
finances of Social Security. The plan would extend the solvency of
Social Security to 2053, White House aides said. That is two years
earlier than under a similar plan in February, but aides said the
new idea would be more politically palatable. Without any changes,
Social Security will be unable to meet its commitments in 2034.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's plan, all surpluses generated by the Social
Security program over the next 15 years _ some $3 trillion of the
$5.9 trillion total surplus _ would be used to buy back government
debt held by the public. This would reduce the government's debt
service costs, and that savings _ an estimated $543 billion _ would
be transferred to the Social Security program.

WELL-CONNECTED CONSULTANT LINKED SUSPECTED CON MAN TO THE
POWERFUL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ohio)  (rm) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN and KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the mysteries about Martin Frankel, the man authorities
suspect of orchestrating a spectacular insurance fraud, is how a
financier who almost never left his well-guarded Greenwich, Conn.,
mansion befriended corporate and religious elites on two
continents.
</P>
<P>
   The answer appears to be that Frankel turned to Thomas Corbally,
a business consultant whose ties to powerful people made him an
insider at Kroll Associates, one of America's best-known private
investigative agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from London on Monday, Corbally
acknowledged that he helped Frankel put a veneer of credibility on
an operation that federal investigators believe siphoned more than
$300 million from a string of insurance companies. He introduced
Frankel to Robert Strauss, the Democratic party heavyweight and
Washington lawyer, Thomas Bolan, the law partner of the late Roy
Cohn, and a monsignor with ties to the Vatican, among others.
</P>
<P>
   He also arranged one of the more bizarre episodes to come to
light in the unfolding saga, a meeting last August at a monastery
in Florence in which a woman friend of Frankel, clad in hot pants
and a bikini top, tried to persuade a prominent priest to accept a
$50 million donation to his charity in exchange for helping Frankel
buy insurance companies. The offer was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Corbally said Monday that he was ``in free fall'' after helping
Frankel. He described himself as a dupe who had no inkling of
Frankel's alleged criminal plans. ``This is the shock of my life,''
Corbally said. ``It is destroying relationships that I built up
over 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has notified Corbally, who is vacationing in London,
that it wants to question him about his role in vouching for
Frankel and hooking him up with lawyers, businessmen and Catholic
leaders in the year before Frankel's insurance empire collapsed.
Corbally said he has nothing to hide and that he intended to
cooperate fully with the FBI. Federal authorities have issued a
warrant for Frankel's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure puts Kroll Associates in an awkward position. The
agency, which recently went public, is one of the companies
corporate America enlists to scrutinize potential business partners
and adversaries. In fact, it was retained last year to look into
Frankel and quickly found potential problems with his operation.
That inquiry apparently did not uncover the role of Corbally, who
had worked directly with Jules Kroll for almost 20 years and had an
office at the firm's Manhattan headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Corbally's records were removed from Kroll
offices under subpoena and delivered to the FBI, according to
people close to the Kroll firm. In an interview Monday, Kroll said
that Corbally misled him about his relationship to Frankel and said
the long-time associate no longer worked with him. He also stressed
that that his company never had any dealings with Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   The ties to Kroll Associates have already had one effect on the
inquiry. Stephen C. Robinson, the United States Attorney in
Connecticut, and a former employee of Kroll and acquaintance of
Corbally, has recused himself from the case.
</P>
<P>
   As a gadfly American businessman in London more than 30 years
ago, Corbally, 78, played a role in exposing the Profumo political
sex and spy scandal that rocked the British government.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the U.S. ambassador to Britain at the time, he
used his contacts to help uncover details about a high-priced call
girl who had relationships with the British minister of war and a
top Russian spy, according to ``Affair of State,'' a book on the
case. Since then, he said, he has worked as a business consultant
to law firms, corporations and governments.
</P>
<P>
   Corbally splits his time between New York and London and lives
mostly in hotels _ the Delmonico in New York, the Claridge in
London. He speaks in a deep baritone voice made gravelly by a
life-long addiction to cigarettes. A flashy dresser partial to
jewelry, Corbally is often chauffeured around in a Mercedes sedan,
people who know him said.
</P>
<P>
   He remains vague on how he first hooked up with Frankel, whom he
knew by the alias David Rosse. He said he learned of Frankel
through ``osmosis'' and struck up a dialogue by phone, followed by
a series of meetings at Frankel's Greenwich estate in the spring of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about this reclusive multi-billionaire who made $100
million a day trading stock,'' Corbally recalled. Though Frankel
grew up in a Jewish household, he appeared to know a great deal
about Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an altar boy but he knew much more than I did. He was
compulsive talker and pontificated about great wealth, prolonging
life, curing sick children and feeding the hungry. He was devoted
to St. Francis of Assisi. I was mesmerized.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Corbally said he was never on Frankel's payroll. But he said he
was attracted by the business possibilities in helping the
financier expand his insurance companies. He said Frankel had a
plan to expand insurance assets he managed more than tenfold, to
$100 billion, in a short time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a business prospect for me, and I wasn't
indifferent,'' Corbally said.
</P>
<P>
   In the months that followed, Corbally opened his Rolodex to
Frankel, a native of Toledo, Ohio, who had few known friends or
supporters when he moved his operation to Greenwich in the early
1990s. One of the most important introductions was to Strauss, the
former ambassador to the Soviet Union who now recruits clients for
the Washington law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld.
</P>
<P>
   After Corbally vouched for Frankel, Strauss accepted the
financier as a client for the firm, several people directly
involved in the matter said. Akin, Gump subsequently represented
Frankel's organization in business deals that were not successfully
concluded, earning several hundred thousand dollars in fees.
</P>
<P>
   Corbally also tried to persuade Lee Iacocca, the former Chrysler
chairman, to serve of the board of advisers of a Catholic charity
Frankel was starting.
</P>
<P>
   Iacocca did not agree.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Corbally subsequently arranged for Iacocca to fly on a
leased Gulfstream IV jet from Los Angeles to Milan, Italy, as a
gift from Frankel designed to get the former auto executive to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, who turned to the insurance business after the
Securities and Exchange Commission demanded he stop trading stocks,
aggressively pursued links to Catholic charities in the summer of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Corbally said he was persuaded that Frankel genuinely hoped to
donate huge sums to charity and he introduced him to people he knew
with connections in the Catholic world.
</P>
<P>
   One of these was Bolan, who would come to serve as Frankel's
attorney in negotiating with Catholic priests. According to court
documents, Bolan was paid at least $75,000 for legal advice he
provided to Frankel. Bolan's lawyer said the actual payment was
smaller.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And it was through one of Corbally's contacts in Italy that
Frankel made his first big pitch to a Catholic charity, known as
the Genesis Center. The center is based in Florence and run by
Father Christopher Zielinski, prior of the San Miniato al Monte
monastery.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Corbally set up a meeting, Frankel sent Kaethe
Schuchter, a young Russian woman who was living in one of his
several homes in Greenwich, to Italy, according to Michele Spike, a
lawyer for the Genesis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Zielinski awaited their arrival in the courtyard of the
monastery. Ms. Schuchter, dressed in scanty summer wear, arrived in
a stretch Mercedes limousine along with a young male friend, an
Italian law student. They boasted of having flown to Europe on the
supersonic Concorde, Ms. Spike said.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch did not go well. Ms. Schuchter offered the $50 million
gift if the Genesis Center would agree to purchase insurance
companies on behalf of Frankel. Funds would come from ``off
shore.'' The Genesis center was not to know their source, Ms. Spike
recalled. (Ms. Schuchter could not be reached for comment.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spike said in a recent interview that she was distraught
about the offer. On Aug. 10, a few days after the meeting, she
wrote a letter to Kroll, saying that the executive's name had been
mentioned as a supporter of Frankel during the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spike warned Kroll in the letter that a man she identified
as David Ross and Corbally might be ``trading off your good name.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Kroll confirmed that he had received the
letter. At the time, he said, he did not have any idea who Frankel
was. But he said he and a senior member of his staff confronted
Corbally twice to ask whether he was involved with the man the
letter referred to as Ross. According to Kroll, Corbally denied any
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was confronted, he was asked specifically about it, and he
denied it,'' Kroll said. ``He denied knowing anything about it to
us.'' Corbally offered a different account of the meeting, saying
he told Kroll that he believed that Frankel was sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll said he had no reason to question Corbally's denial at the
time. He said the inquiries were unrelated to a separate
investigation into Frankel that Kroll Associates did on behalf on
an investment banking client last fall. That inquiry, which Kroll
described as cursory, did not turn up information about Corbally's
role.
</P>
<P>
   Though rebuffed by the Genesis Center, Corbally and Bolan, the
lawyer he recruited to the Frankel team, had success at the
Vatican. Certain that Frankel intended to share his wealth with
Vatican-sponsored charities, the two helped persuade priests there
to work with Frankel. After negotiations, an organization whose
leaders had ties to the Vatican founded a charity called the St.
Francis of Assisi Foundation. It failed in several attempts to buy
insurance companies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When state regulators who oversee insurance companies began to
raise questions about the way Frankel dealt with the insurance
companies' investment money, Corbally defended Frankel. During one
bout with regulators in Mississippi, Corbally and Frankel together
called Strauss, the Akin, Gump, lawyer, asking him to get involved
on their behalf, people briefed about the conversation said.
Strauss declined, these people said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Corbally said he did not learn of Frankel's
suspected corrupt dealings until after Frankel disappeared. ``I had
no idea Frankel was a crook,'' he said flatly.
</P>
<P>
   But Corbally's relationship with Frankel raises the question of
whether he's the ``Tom'' Frankel cryptically referred to in a note
he left behind before fleeing. According to court documents filed
by federal prosecutors, Frankel wrote out a series of questions and
then consulted astrological charts for answers. Among the questions
was one that read: ``Will Tom turn me in?''

IN SOUTH FLORIDA CANALS, REVIVAL OF RARE CROCODILES
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The airboat moved through the dark and rain with a sound
like rolling thunder as a powerful searchlight stabbed into the
murky shallows of the nuclear power plant's cooling canals, turning
the calm water a shimmering gold. The beam of light settled on a
pair of red, glowing eyes, and the airboat rumbled up to a fat,
gray, saltwater crocodile, eight feet long.
</P>
<P>
   She was a female, waiting in the shallows for her instincts to
tell her that her babies, inside eggs buried in the black dirt of
the bank of the canal here at the Turkey Point nuclear plant, were
ready to hatch. Joe Wasilewski, a South Florida wildlife biologist
piloting the airboat, stared down at the endangered crocodile with
something very much like love.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't catch her,'' Wasilewski said as she whipped a tail
that could crack a grown man's legs and disappeared in the gloom.
Later, as the rain slowed and the mosquitoes matched it, drop for
drop, in the darkness, Wasilewski spotted a young crocodile in
shallow water. Leaning over the bow, he snatched it from the canal.
</P>
<P>
   The crocodile, a year old and two feet long and with teeth like
tiny fish hooks, lay like a sleepy kitten in his grip.
``Beautiful,'' Wasilewski said, before weighing, measuring, and
testing the computer microchip, previously planted under its hide,
that allows biologists to identify it.
</P>
<P>
   Then the young crocodile, a North American Saltwater Crocodile,
part of a species slowly clawing its way back from the edge of
extinction, plopped back into the shallows and vanished into a dark
specked with those glowing, reddish eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, it's working,'' Wasilewski said of a management
program to save a modern-day dragon that many people, even those
who live beside it, do not know exists.
</P>
<P>
   The species, which some biologists say could be as old as 200
million years, once swarmed in countless numbers around the
southern peninsula of Florida, the only place in this country where
they are found. But in the last 100 years, developers destroyed the
crocodiles' habitat with mall parking lots, two-car garages, sea
walls and poolside patios, erasing mangroves and marshes.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of this century, poachers turned much of what
was left of the species into luggage, so that by the 1970s as few
as 200 or 300 had survived. Now, through not only the efforts of
conservationists but also construction that these crocodiles have
claimed as their own, like placid golf course ponds and the nuclear
power plant canals, they now number more than 600 in the salt water
around South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   These are not dirt-common, fresh-water alligators, which number
more than 1.5 million in Florida, but a more exotic cousin, a
creature with long, menacing teeth and a thinner, tapered snout,
much different from the shovel-shaped snout of the alligator. They
are similar in size, but crocodiles are more agile.
</P>
<P>
   The big crocodiles that Wasilewski pointed out in the cooling
canals glided in graceful, S-shaped curves through the water, then
vanished with blinding speed when they felt threatened.
</P>
<P>
   But like the alligator, whose numbers have increased so much
that they have spilled over into condominium ponds and parking
lots, saltwater crocodiles are doing so well that they, too, have
begun to slink beyond the remote havens like Turkey Point, south of
Miami, and are creeping into the yards of Floridians.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was way up the Miami River, eating a lady's ducks,'' said
Todd Hardwick, an alligator trapper who, more and more, answers
calls to remove nuisance alligators only to find a crocodile
instead. ``The last one I saw, there on the Miami River, had a cat
in its mouth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As their numbers teetered on extinction, crocodiles found refuge
in the warm, salty water that filled some 170 miles of cooling
canals at Turkey Point, where the placid water, filled with
turtles, fish and crabs, suited them.
</P>
<P>
   ``An alligator will live and breed in a drainage ditch, but a
crocodile is particular about its habitat, and even more particular
about nesting,'' Wasilewski said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some 60 crocodiles, fully one-tenth of the species'
survivors, live here. But others found the placid waters of golf
course ponds suitable, and even nested in sand traps. And though
they feed mostly on fish and other things in the water, pets become
easy prey.
</P>
<P>
   There are no recorded crocodile attacks on people in South
Florida, probably because the species, which is described by
wildlife experts as shy and timid, usually, was so rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten deaths were attributed to Christmas trees last year, and
seven deaths to balloons,'' said Wasilewski, who has a contract
with Florida Power, which owns the Turkey Point plant, to study and
to look after the crocodiles. ``Some day, someone's going to get
killed by a croc.''
</P>
<P>
   They have been seen in the nicest places. They have been spotted
in Gables by the Sea, one of the Miami area's finest residential
neighborhoods, and at golf courses on Key Largo and on Key
Biscayne.
</P>
<P>
   Wasilewski and other wildlife experts hope that the crocodiles
will gravitate more toward less populated parts of the peninsula,
where they are less likely to come into contact with people.
</P>
<P>
   At Turkey Point, it is almost time for the baby crocodiles to
hatch, and the mothers drift in the water nearby, waiting.
Wasilewski searched through the berms for nests, hoping to find a
nest already hatching, but it is too early.
</P>
<P>
   When it is time, the mother will crawl ashore and pat the soil
around the nest _ ``She remembers about where she laid them, but
not exactly,'' said Wasilewski _ until she hears an answering cry
from under the soil. She will then help dig the babies out as they
are hatching.
</P>
<P>
   ``She puts her ear to the soil and listens,'' Wasilewski said.
He watched it happen, once, and calls it a beautiful thing. It is
one of the reasons he admires the creatures, and wants them to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Wasilewski says he believes that the crocodiles know him, know
his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hate my guts,'' he reasoned. ```Here he comes to put
another rope around my neck,''' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   They do not know that he means well.

CLINTON UNVEILS PLAN TO AID SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AMID NEW
BUDGET FIGURES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton unveiled new budget figures
Monday that project an extra $1 trillion in surpluses over the next
15 year, and he proposed the money be used to shore up Social
Security and Medicare and pay off the national debt by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now cut up Washington's credit card,'' Clinton said in
a South Lawn ceremony to unveil mid-year White House budget
revisions.
</P>
<P>
   The new projections revise figures compiled in February that
projected a $700 million surplus within five years, $2.4 trillion
in 10 years and $4.47 trillion in 15 years. The new projections
raise the accumulated surplus after 15 years to $5.47 trillion. The
event upstaged a planned Republican news conference Tuesday to
unveil Congressional Budget Office figures that project even
greater surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Congress are staking out positions now for a
crucial showdown later this legislative session over the surplus.
Republicans favor a broad-based tax cut while also setting aside
money to save Social Security from bankruptcy. Clinton favors
extending Social Security and Medicare while offering targeted tax
cuts and increases in spending for programs such as education.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton suggested to reporters he would be willing to
negotiate on the tax cut issue. ``Within the framework of achieving
these objectives, obviously I'll be working with the Congress to
achieve them,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures announced by Clinton also allowed him to amend
the budget plan he outlined in February. The revised forecasts
project a $98.9 billion surplus for this fiscal year which ends
September 31, almost $20 billion more than predicted in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improvements in the outlook since February have added $179
billion to the projected budget surplus over five years, half a
trillion over 10 years and a trillion over 15 years,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money, Clinton said, means all Social Security payroll
taxes can be devoted strictly to the Social Security trust fund and
the fund, now facing bankruptcy, could be extended to 2053. The
additional surplus means Medicare can be extended and expanded, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Money also can be set aside for the national debt, targeted tax
relief and more money for education and children, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the unexpected cash is just proof to some that taxes are far
too high. Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said Americans have a right to pay less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can shore up Social Security and Medicare and still provide
tax relief to American families and individuals who are working
harder than ever but can't seem to get ahead,'' Archer, R-Texas,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., blasted Clinton for
announcing the new figures, outlining his new proposals and then
leaving for New York and Connecticut to raise money for the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He runs into town, throws out supposedly an agenda; does
nothing to really make it happen; and off he goes again,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I don't know whether he's serious or not, but if he is,
we're going to have to see more than words. We need to see some
deeds,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the extra cash, Clinton called for all Social
Security payroll taxes to be earmarked for Social Security only.
Clinton initially called for 62 percent of the projected surplus to
be saved for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The United States technically marked its first budget surplus in
30 years last fiscal year. But even then, critics noted, the use of
Social Security trust funds, which are invested in government
notes, mask the true size of the annual federal deficit. However,
Clinton said new projections forecast a $5 billion surplus next
year even excluding Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   It's the repayment of those invested Social Security funds and
the use of the non-Social Security surplus for other programs that
would lower the $5.7 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we can pay off that debt; by 2015, this country can be
entirely out of debt. This is a remarkable milestone, but it is
clearly within reach, if we do not squander the surplus by choosing
short-term gain over long-term national goals,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would extend the life of Social Security to 2053.
Currently, Social Security will go bankrupt when the large baby
boom generation retires.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said he will announce Tuesday revisions in
Medicare that not only will extend the life of that health
insurance program to 2025 but also provide coverage for
prescription medicine for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced the creation of a new $156 billion children's
and education trust fund. The proposal would provide money for Head
Start, hire 100,000 new teachers and pay for improvements in
children's health.
</P>
<P>
   The president noted that the additional surplus would allow the
financing of his own tax relief ideas, including the creation of
USA Accounts that would use tax credits to encourage workers to set
up their own retirement accounts. His other tax relief proposals
include the use of tax credits for: stay-at-home mothers, long-term
care, modernizing 6,000 schools, child care and encouraging
business investment in poor communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surplus is the hard-earned product of our fiscal
discipline. We should use it to prepare for the great challenges
facing our country _ caring for our parents, caring for our
children, freeing our nation from the shackles of debt so that we
can have long-term, sustained economic prosperity,'' Clinton said.

ADVISORY PANEL VOTES FOR USE OF EMBRYONIC CELLS IN RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Consulting their political as well as their ethical
compasses, members of a White House ethics panel decided in a straw
vote on Monday to recommend that federally financed scientists be
allowed to derive embryonic stem cells from human embryos as well
as to conduct research on stem cells derived by others.
</P>
<P>
   The vote by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, which
follows the recommendation of its draft report released last month,
frames a position that some members hope will be more acceptable to
abortion opponents in Congress than the strategy being pursued by
the National Institutes of Health, the principal source of
universities' biomedical research funds.
</P>
<P>
   Embryonic stem cells can develop into almost any tissue of the
body. In the seven months since they were first isolated they have
aroused intense interest as a possible all-purpose tissue repair
kit for a host of afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   But of the two principal ways in which the stem cells can be
harvested, the more convenient involves the destruction of a living
embryo. The embryos _ microscopic blobs of a few hundred cells not
yet ready to implant in the uterus - are ones that have been
discarded by fertility clinics. In the other method, cells are
taken from aborted fetuses, a use that the commission views as
arguably equivalent to transplanting kidneys or corneas from a
cadaver.
</P>
<P>
   The line the commission seeks to draw must run through morally
contested ground _ between those who say an embryo deserves the
same rights as a person, and those who believe the prospect of
significant medical progress justifies the destruction of embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress opposed to abortion have incorporated the
first view into a clause that prohibits federal funds being used
for any research in which an embryo is destroyed. For the last
three years the clause has been attached as a rider to the bill
setting the National Institutes of Health's budget.
</P>
<P>
   NIH officials hope to finesse the rider through a legal opinion
issued this January by the Department of Health and Human Services.
The opinion holds that federally financed scientists can do
research on human embryonic cells derived with private funds, even
though it would be illegal for them to derive the cells themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Although 33 Nobel laureates have supported embryonic stem cell
research, no less than 70 members of Congress are furious with the
department's interpretation of the rider, saying in a letter that
the funding of embryonic stem cell research ``would violate both
the letter and spirit of the Federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   In a draft report released last month, the National Bioethics
Advisory Commission agreed it was morally inconsistent to let
scientists do research on cells they could not legally derive.
``There is no compelling ethical justification for distinguishing
between the derivation and use of human stem cells,'' the
commission said. It went on to conclude, as a draft recommendation,
that federally funded scientists should be allowed to do both.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's meeting, one member, Dr. Thomas H. Murray, president
of the Hastings Center, a research organization that deals with
ethics issues, said that having the government support research on
the cells but not their derivation would in fact be the better
policy because it would avoid offending those who are troubled by
the destruction of embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we speak to a great number of Americans who have
complex views and who are undecided, and many of these will find a
distinction between use and derivation useful with respect to
public funding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other members said privately that they thought that
anti-abortion congressmen would be more likely to respect a
consistent position on the derivation and use of the cells. When a
straw poll was taken between this position and Murray's, there were
10 votes against Murray's proposal, three abstentions and
apparently none in favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought not hide behind the idea that this is just use. That
is what the NIH tried to do but I don't think it will convince the
people who need to be convinced,'' said Alexander M. Capron, an
ethicist at the University of Southern California Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members discussed the fact the human embryonic stem
cells can be derived by a method that is indisputably legal and far
less controversial than using embryos discarded by fertility
clinics. That is to culture the cells from aborted fetuses. During
fetal development, a batch of embryonic cells known as the germline
cells is sequestered as a future source of sperm or eggs. Embryonic
stem cells were developed from a fetus' germline cells last
November. They are assumed to be equivalent to the stem cells
derived from embryos, although this has not yet been proved.
</P>
<P>
   ``To derive stem cells from fetal tissue is a slog; it's
extremely difficult,'' said David R. Cox of the Stanford University
School of Medicine. But what would be lost, the commission several
times asked itself, if it recommended approval of just the fetal
source of stem cells and left for later a decision on using spare
embryos?
</P>
<P>
   The answer given by Cox and by Carol W. Greider of Johns Hopkins
University was that research with embryo-derived stem cells would
then speed ahead in private companies. Federally supported
researchers would not be able to contribute, impeding progress,
there would be no system of federal oversight, and an important new
area of science would be completely controlled by private
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report will be completed in July, said its
chair, Harold T. Shapiro, president of Princeton University. One
test of its success may be how it plays in Congress, where
opponents of stem cell research plan to reintroduce the rider.
</P>
<P>
   Though advocates of the research can now emphasize the probable
benefits of stem cells, the balance of forces seems at present too
close to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``NIH doesn't know that they have the votes to reverse the
prohibition,'' said Richard Doerflinger, associate director for
policy development at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
``But I don't know that my side has the votes to get language that
would explicitly ban it.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCE, Ala. _ Steven Merrill was one of the first autoworkers
Mercedes-Benz hired as it geared up to build sport utility vehicles
here in 1994. He has received steady raises and a two-month
training trip to Germany. He even met his wife on the assembly
line.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the United Automobile Workers union is trying to organize
the Mercedes factory, and Merrill does not want any part of it. ``I
really don't believe we need the UAW,'' said Merrill, 37, who
earned more than $80,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   He is delighted with his pay and benefits and with the collegial
atmosphere on the factory floor, and many of his co-workers agree
with him, more than a dozen interviews suggest. They say they
signed on for nonunion jobs at what was a 100 percent German-owned
factory, but after Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler Corp. last year,
they found themselves caught up in a high-profile union organizing
drive.
</P>
<P>
   UAW officials say they will prevail at Vance _ if Daimler plays
fair. The union has repeatedly contended that Mercedes managers
made their anti-union views clear when the plant opened and at
frequent intervals subsequently. The company, which now employs
69,000 union members from the former Chrysler Corp., has promised
to stay neutral during the organizing drive. ``I feel very
confident that those workers, given a free choice, will choose to
be UAW,'' said Bob King, a union vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But the UAW is in new territory in Alabama, the heart of a
region that has not only been inhospitable to unions but that
increasingly beckons to foreign automakers. DaimlerChrysler, BMW
and Honda Motor have recently announced plans to expand or add
factories in the South. As the auto industry disperses from its
traditional base in the more union-friendly Midwest, the UAW may
face more fights like the one shaping up in this unlikely hotbed of
union activity.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street from the one-room Vance Town Hall, the UAW has
set up a recruiting office sandwiched between an insurance agency
and a Texaco station that doubles as Vance's grocery store. Modest
houses and trailer homes offer views of the highway and the
railroad tracks that bisect the town. A few rolling hills away,
well back from the highway, the pale white and gray outlines of the
Mercedes factory glint through tall stands of pines.
</P>
<P>
   The organizing campaign here is a big topic in Detroit, where
the UAW and DaimlerChrysler began negotiating earlier this month on
the labor contract that will cover the company's UAW workers when
the current contract expires this fall. Eager to avoid a strike
that could shutter DaimlerChrysler's highly profitable American
operations, executives have taken the unusual step of promising not
to fight the union in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the UAW, Stephen Yokich, and the vice
president, Jack Laskowski, have pressed the point with the
DaimlerChrysler co-chairmen, Juergen Schrempp and Robert Eaton,
along with other top executives. ``It is a large company, and Steve
and Jack remind us whenever something seems not neutral,'' Thomas
Stallkamp, president of DaimlerChrysler's North American
operations, said as labor talks opened earlier this month. ``We're
making every effort we have to to make sure that the large number
of people involved in management know that that's the management
position on this.''
</P>
<P>
   He has not heard the last from the UAW. ``We'll continue to meet
until we can get this done right,'' Yokich promised.
</P>
<P>
   The union must win support from a majority of the factory's
1,300 workers here to represent them, and that is proving an uphill
battle. In Alabama, as in the rest of the South, unions are far
less common than elsewhere in the country. Just 9.7 percent of
Alabama's workers belonged to a union last year, compared with 21.6
percent in Michigan, traditional home of the American auto
industry, and 13.9 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, workers at the Fieldcrest Cannon plant in
Kannapolis, N.C., apparently voted to join the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, but only after 93
years of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Even when unions are established in the region, they find it
more difficult to operate. Like North Carolina, Alabama is a
so-called right to work state, which means that even if a union
wins the right to represent employees, the workers are not
compelled to join and pay full dues and union fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a right-to-work state, you have to have a lot of courage to
be a union supporter,'' said Dennis Devaney, a former member of the
National Labor Relations Board and a labor law professor at Wayne
State University in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Brown, a management lawyer at Duvin, Cahn &AMP; Hutton in
Cleveland, said, ``You've got a generally nonunion and
union-unfriendly environment'' in the South.
</P>
<P>
   While Daimler-Benz set out to make its first American Mercedes
factory nonunion, it has long had close working relationships with
unions in Germany. Mercedes-Benz workers there are represented by
the powerful IG Metall union, whose members have sat on the
company's board for years. Daimler's German workers are well paid
and, like other European workers, have generous benefits that
include six weeks of vacations.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes workers in Alabama earned far less than their
German counterparts when the factory opened in October 1994 _ just
$12.80 an hour _ but the company gave them frequent steady raises.
With current exchange rates, the Alabama Mercedes workers now earn
roughly the same as their German counterparts, while their benefits
remain lower.
</P>
<P>
   Even some workers at the Vance factory who oppose the union
acknowledge that they would be unlikely to be paid so much if it
were not for the UAW's efforts in the North. But because Mercedes
already pays well, the UAW cannot woo supporters with promises of a
jump in wages. Workers here for more than two years earn between
$20.50 and $24.25 an hour, depending on their jobs, compared with
an average $21 an hour at DaimlerChrysler's unionized plants.
Benefits are comparable. At Vance, however, perks include discounts
of roughly 25 percent on leases of Mercedes sport utility vehicles,
bringing the fee for factory workers to about $400 a month.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In random interviews conducted as employees drove out of the
factory gates, many volunteered that they were grateful to be
working here, contrasting this job to others in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The factory has adopted the kind of feel-good practices favored
by both modern management gurus and anti-union labor lawyers, and
that has helped keep workers content. The company doles out free
Mercedes clothing, emphasizes teamwork and responsibility and even
gave away movie tickets when the Mercedes sport utility vehicle
starred in ``The Lost World,'' the dinosaur sequel to ``Jurassic
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the biggest complaint of pro-union workers here seems to
be that there is too much overtime. ``I appreciate my job, and I
make good money,'' said J. Chris Johnson, 27, who said he
nonetheless favors union representation. ``It is about having time
with your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he did not get to see much of his 20-month-old
daughter because she goes to bed at 8 p.m. and he does not get home
until 6:30, more than 12 hours after starting his shift.
</P>
<P>
   With fatherhood came fond memories of his father's history as a
union man. ``As long as I ever remembered, he worked eight hours a
day with a paid lunch,'' Johnson said. ``That's the way he fed me
and clothed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson estimated that the UAW has the support of about half the
workers here. Other workers interviewed _ both those for and
against the union _ put the level of support lower, closer to 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Few workers openly support the union, but many who oppose it are
not shy about letting their views be known. Some workers wear
anti-union stickers in the factory and many have found anti-union
leaflets on tables in break areas. While both the union and the
company are allowed to distribute information, little pro-union
material is found in the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The union says it has not asked workers to distribute its
material in the plant for two reasons: It wants to protect them
from possible retaliation, and it wants to take the high road in
the organizing campaign, while pressing DaimlerChrysler to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to divide the shop floor,'' said King, the UAW
organizer. ``We think the power of the relationship should really
create an open environment where people can decide whether they
want to be in the union.''
</P>
<P>
   The company insists that the anti-union fliers and stickers have
not come from managers. Merrill said they came from the anti-union
group he formed, the Team Members Information Committee, which
began distributing the leaflets and stickers about a month ago. So
far it has spent about $800 on printing, he said. The money came
from workers and from small businesses in nearby Tuscaloosa, he
said, declining to identify them except to say they include real
estate agents, contractors and restaurant owners but ``no one
that's a supplier or no one that we supply to.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill added, ``The company is doing nothing to support this.''
</P>
<P>
   In phone calls and meetings at the union hall and a nearby
hotel, the UAW has been asking workers to sign cards indicating
their interest in joining. Typically, when a union collects
signature cards of at least 30 percent of the work force, it may
petition the National Labor Relations Board to hold a secret-ballot
election, and, if at least 51 percent vote in favor, the workers
can then organize, according to NLRB spokesman Dave Parker.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, companies recognize a union without an election
if the union has collected cards from at least 51 percent of the
workers, he said. While the UAW has pressed DaimlerChrysler to
agree to a card check, and the company has not refused outright, it
has said it wants to be sure workers' voices are heard.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many workers here seem to shun the union because times
are so good. More than 45,000 people applied for jobs here, and
turnover is rock-bottom: about 1 percent a year at this cavernous,
clean factory, where workers wear company-provided slacks and polo
shirts stitched with their first names. They build about 375 cars a
day, various models of the ML-320, which starts at $35,450, and the
ML-430, which costs $45,000, fully equipped.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya Hallmark, 33, was among the 3 percent of applicants chosen
by Daimler. In the last three years, she has been transformed from
an $8-an-hour T-shirt factory seamstress to a $50,000-a-year
autoworker who drives a Mercedes-Benz. Her teen-age son begs her to
get him a job like hers someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company gives us very good benefits, and they pay us
well,'' said Mrs. Hallmark, a welder, who said she saw no need for
a union. ``If they come in we're going to lose what we've got.''

NEW ORLEANS, A CITY OF SERIOUS EATERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To assert that New Orleans is serious about its restaurants is
like saying that mountains are high and water is wet: It's a
natural fact.
</P>
<P>
   Offer even a tentative opinion about a particular restaurant to
a resident of this food-crazed city and chances are the response
will include not only a detailed history of that establishment and
its food, but a list of a half-dozen other places that are better,
and subtle suggestions about why partisans of the restaurant in
question are so misinformed.
</P>
<P>
   The level of debate is so high that finding restaurants about
which New Orleans residents actually agree is a rare thing. Yet
consensus is possible. I visited the city late in March, when warm
southern breezes were easing the region into its pleasant
pre-humidity interlude, and with friends found a handful of
restaurants that enjoy deserved local popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Another restaurant, Delmonico, is an old landmark under new
ownership, and the returns from the parishes are not yet in.
</P>
<P>
   Though regional food today is no longer confined to its home,
these restaurants could probably exist no place other than in New
Orleans, and not just because of the particular blend of Cajun and
Creole cuisines that gives the area its culinary identity.
</P>
<P>
   They are defined as much by their casual, easy pride in a
tradition that so values eating. Pretension is a rare thing, even
in the more formal, historic New Orleans establishments that cling
to old-fashioned rituals with tenacious crab claws.
</P>
<P>
   As eager as I was to join in the local debate, I found myself
following a paradoxical but sage bit of advice: ``Just close your
mouth and eat.'' Even in New Orleans, you sometimes can't argue
with what's on the plate. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Upperline
</P>
<P>
   This welcoming, intimate restaurant near the Garden District is
as idiosyncratic as a secondhand bookstore, reflecting the tastes
and interests of the owner, JoAnn Clevenger. Almost every inch of
the three small dining rooms is covered with folk art, and the
front room contains shelves of urns and pitchers, like some old
collector's attic.
</P>
<P>
   Not content with this display, Ms. Clevenger includes with her
menu a list of her favorite things, including radio stations,
antique shops, clothing stores and smells. ``Remember to be a
little silly, a little jaunty,'' she advises.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing silly about the food, though. While Richard
Benz's menu is not nearly as quirky as the dining room, it is
distinguished by the outstanding cooking and lively turn it gives
familiar Cajun and Creole dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Fried green tomatoes, a signature dish, are terrific. They are
served underneath an exceptional shrimp remoulade that achieves the
perfect ratio of sauce to shellfish. Greedy for a variety of
flavors, I ordered as an appetizer the trio of soups, which
included demitasse servings of creamy oyster stew, rich duck gumbo
and thick turtle soup, all notable for their deep, complex flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Duck is ubiquitous on New Orleans menus, but by far the best I
had was at Upperline, where it is called Tom Cowman's Famous Roast
Duck, named for a former chef who clearly had solved the problem of
cooking duck without drying it out.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous portion, a half duck, is moist and delicious,
accompanied by a superfluous sweet garlic-port sauce, sensibly
served on the side. Veal grillades, or sauteed veal scallops, are
also unusually flavorful, served in a sauce with green peppers and
mushrooms and excellent Cheddar grits.
</P>
<P>
   The wine list is not thrilling but includes some decent,
moderately priced bottles like a California pinot noir from Kent
Rasmussen ($40) that hit just the right peppery notes.
</P>
<P>
   When appetizers and main courses achieve such a high level,
desserts can often be anticlimactic, but Upperline's were as good
as everything else. Bread pudding is a classic New Orleans dessert,
and Upperline's version is delicate and deep, served with cinnamon,
nuts and caramel sauce. Creme brulee came with pralines crumbled
across the top, a sweet, satisfying combination.
</P>
<P>
   Service at Upperline is relaxed yet precise, one of many
indications that Upperline, more than halfway through its second
decade in business, is not about to coast. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peristyle
</P>
<P>
   With its casual, comfortable dining room, checkerboard terrazzo
floor and mural of City Park on one wall, Peristyle has the
deceptively unpretentious air of a neighborhood bar and grill,
belying an almost obsessive pursuit of fresh ingredients and clear,
strong flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Kearney, the chef and owner, combines the discipline of a
French kitchen with a casual New Orleans manner, making this
romantic little restaurant on the fringe of the French Quarter a
favorite of people obsessed with food and couples obsessed with
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Appetizers are wondrous, like Louisiana crab salad, a tangy
blend of crab meat and horseradish set over paper-thin slices of
chilled beets and pickled red onions. Taken as a whole, the dish
has the spicy, syncopated harmony of a jazz quintet.
</P>
<P>
   Another appetizer, a generous serving of oysters poached in a
sauce of roasted peppers, leeks and tomatoes, sounds similar hot
notes, accented with the pure flavors of fresh basil and bacon.
</P>
<P>
   The main courses don't have quite the jaunty style of the
appetizers, offering subtle luxury instead. Thick squares of
beautifully charred lamb loin are served in a sweet reduction of
red wine and garlic surrounding a layered mound of tomatoes and
zucchini, while rich, meaty squab has a lively gaminess cushioned
by a velvety sauce of red wine and foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   The well-chosen, reasonable wine list includes more than a few
choices that can match the elegance of these dishes, like one of my
favorites, a Chinon Clos du Chene Vert from Charles Joguet ($45).
</P>
<P>
   Sumptuous desserts include a beautifully textured semolina fig
cake, topped with a plump, sweet fig and served with hazelnut ice
cream, and a fine tart of pears poached in red wine set in almond
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Service at Peristyle is flawless, right up to the valet who
refused a tip for the privilege of parking my friend's restored
1963 Buick Riviera. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brigtsen's
</P>
<P>
   In its little cottage in the Riverbend section, Brigtsen's is so
homey that you feel as if you've been welcomed to spend the night
with a great-aunt. The dining area is spread out among three small
rooms, with maybe three or four tables each, and the bright
lighting, chintz and patterned wallpaper suggest an old Midwestern
parlor, an effect enhanced by the friendly, efficient service.
</P>
<P>
   The food, though, is pure New Orleans, freshened by an
experimental approach that often works, but sometimes doesn't. An
appetizer of sauteed sweetbreads, for example, is tender and
delicious in a rich, dark mustard-flavored demi-glace, served with
roasted new potatoes, capers and shiitake mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But a soup, called ``Backyard Crawfish Boil,'' is monochromatic,
full of crawfish and potatoes but with little flavor outside of the
thyme-scented broth. ``It's the first night we've served it,'' the
waitress explained, suggesting that it was a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to take a chance with the new, Frank Brigtsen,
who does almost all the cooking himself in a kitchen not much
bigger than a phone booth, keeps old reliables on the menu, like a
big, gutsy appetizer of rabbit tenderloin in a peppery mustard
sauce, served with a cylinder of Parmesan grits threaded with bits
of spicy tasso, a Cajun cured pork specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Proximity to the Gulf of Mexico gives New Orleans chefs access
to all sorts of unusual seafood that is typically labeled on menus
as ``Gulf fish,'' and that changes according to the catch.
</P>
<P>
   One night Brigtsen's was serving broiled sheep's-head fish,
mildly flavored, moist and loosely textured, crusted with crab meat
and Parmesan. The delicate white fish would have been quite good,
but it was covered in a creamy lemon mousseline, burying the
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled pompano is another busy dish, served with oysters and
artichoke hearts in a bordelaise sauce. Yet this time the
beautifully cooked fish was enhanced rather than overwhelmed by the
accompaniments.
</P>
<P>
   Roast duck is crisp-skinned and tender, served with cornbread
dressing and a sweet gravy made with honey and pecans, while
Brigtsen takes a decidedly un-New Orleans turn with tasty braised
lamb shank, served in a phyllo pouch with pine nuts, rice, spinach
and feta.
</P>
<P>
   The short wine list at Brigtsen's includes some excellent,
moderately priced bottles, like a soft but spicy California syrah
from Fess Parker ($28).
</P>
<P>
   I loved the desserts, from fresh, ripe strawberries served with
zabaglione, creme fraiche and a thin slice of pound cake to an
exceptionally delicate banana bread pudding in a banana-flavored
rum sauce. But my absolute favorite was the intensely
coffee-flavored cafe-au-lait creme brulee, served warm and
crisp-topped. It's worth lying sleepless at night if only to think
about it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delmonico
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of the Garden District, this landmark restaurant had
closed in 1997 after a century in business, and was renovated and
reopened by Emeril Lagasse, the TV chef. Unlike Lagasse's earlier
New Orleans restaurants, Emeril's and Nola, which display his
contemporary Louisiana cuisine, Delmonico looks back, offering
formal Creole cooking almost as if it were a dying tradition in
need of protection.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few historic New Orleans restaurants continue to
serve this sort of food, though, and you can't help but wonder why
Lagasse feels the need for such self-conscious preservation.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Delmonico's hushed dining room, with solid, heavy
chairs of soft tan leather, thick linens and hefty silverware, has
a serious air about it, complete with tableside cooking and
carving. Our roguish waiter managed to lighten the atmosphere with
some welcome wisecracks, but the food showed little evidence of his
humor or flair.
</P>
<P>
   Turtle soup with sherry, typically a robust, peppery dish,
packed little punch, while fried green tomatoes with crab meat
tasted mostly of heavy breading, and had precious little crab. The
best appetizer by far was crab meat Remnick, a wonderfully savory,
peppery rice dish that blended soft textures and classically
assertive flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Main courses included some beautifully old-fashioned cooking,
like redfish sauteed in butter until it was crisp outside but still
deliciously moist within. Yet there were also mushy baked shrimp,
overwhelmed by their crab stuffing and smothered in shoestring
potatoes that seemed out of place on the plate. Country-style duck
was powerfully flavored, almost gamy, served both as sliced breast
and as confit, duck leg that has been preserved in its fat.
</P>
<P>
   I preferred the confit to the tender breast, but the best part
of the dish was the garnish of greens with ham hocks, a great
old-time combination.
</P>
<P>
   The wine list, extensive and expensive, does include some fine
mid-range bottles like a tart, dry Savennieres from Yves Tijou
($45) and a forward, easy to enjoy California pinot noir from
Sanford ($44).
</P>
<P>
   Dessert included a marvelous bread pudding and a fair bananas
Foster, the old-time New Orleans dish, which was prepared with
great panache tableside, complete with a flambe moment. But in the
end, it's just sauteed bananas over ice cream. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Commander's Palace
</P>
<P>
   When I expressed disappointment to a friend over my meal at
Delmonico, he insisted that we go to Commander's Palace in the
Garden District, where Lagasse was executive chef in the 1980s. The
old-fashioned Creole cooking that Delmonico celebrates so
ponderously is offered at Commander's with consummate grace and
ease. It's all the more noteworthy because Commander's is such a
huge operation, serving an astonishing volume of food seamlessly
and beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the confusing complex of dining rooms that surround the
central kitchen seems slightly threadbare, and the rooms are not
shown to their best advantage in the dull lighting. But the turtle
soup here, with lots of pepper and bits of turtle, has spirit and
depth, made with a stock that doesn't just deliver flavor but soars
high before easing into a long finish.
</P>
<P>
   Duck gumbo is rich, complex and peppery. One appetizer, though,
a stew of wild mushrooms and truffles, is a bore, with little to
offer beyond the one-dimensional mushroom flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Our main courses were uniformly wonderful. Crawfish maque choux
is a robust stew served over fluffy rice with plenty of tender
crawfish, corn, okra, peppers and onions, and a dark and dense
crawfish sauce flavored with thyme. Roasted boned quail are spicy
and full of flavor, stuffed with crawfish sausage and served with a
relish of sauteed corn and jalapeno.
</P>
<P>
   The book-length wine list includes many worthy selections,
though the wine I chose, an Alsatian pinot gris from Trimbach
($37), wasn't quite hefty enough for the food.
</P>
<P>
   Commander's is famous for its bread pudding souffle, but we
sidestepped that dessert for strawberry shortcake, made with sweet
local strawberries, whipped cream and a buttermilk biscuit, the
perfect end to a rich meal. If you're after something more solid,
though, you couldn't do better than the cheesecake, made with
Creole cream cheese, a tart Louisiana product that paradoxically
manages to impart both lightness and richness. It's the kind of New
Orleans mystery that is best left unresolved.

SPORTS COLUMN: NETS HOPING TO DO WHAT KNICKS DID 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The word ``interim'' had been extracted
from Don Casey's title as if it were a bad tooth.
</P>
<P>
   He now was the Nets' coach with a three-year contract, although
only the first season's $1.1 million was guaranteed. As he talked,
Keith Van Horn and Kendall Gill sat nearby, and now Stephon
Marbury, in a sport shirt, shorts and sneakers, strolled across the
court at the Nets' complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll cost you $500,'' the coach said, alluding to the Nets'
fine for tardiness. ``And you forgot your tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury laughed along with everybody else, hugged Casey, then
sat down with Van Horn and Gill, their presence showing their
support for the retention of the 62-year-old Casey, a basketball
lifer who never had a big break before.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everybody back healthy,'' Casey was saying now, ``it'll
be fun, it'll be exciting and we'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, the Nets must win, if only to challenge the
``team across the river,'' as the Knicks are known here. After a
shortened season that began with the Nets the team to watch before
injuries depleted their roster and Coach John Calipari was fired,
the Knicks were the team that was watched throughout seven weeks of
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And in conversations during Casey's coronation Monday, the
Knicks' success in getting to the National Basketball Association
finals intruded every so often.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rowe, the Nets' president, even called the Knicks ``my
second-favorite team,'' and Willis Reed, a Nets senior vice
president, joked about his former favorite team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't working for the Nets, I would've gotten one of my
old Knick uniforms and limped out on the Garden court before a game
last week,'' Reed said, thinking of when he did just that as the
Knicks' captain before they routed the Lakers in the seventh game
of the 1970 finals. ``But I don't think my Nets bosses would have
appreciated that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Knicks' seven weeks of playoffs, the Nets were
watching and learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that anything is possible,'' Gill said. ``What the
Knicks did with Patrick hurt was amazing. And if Patrick could've
played in the final, I think they would've won it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing would presumably agree that the Knicks would have
won the title with him at center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to play, that's it,'' Ewing said Sunday, looking to
next season. ``My role is not going to change. I have a lot of
great players on my team; we just have to believe in each other and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   What has to change, of course, is Ewing's health: a damaged and
eventually partly torn Achilles' tendon this season, a shattered
wrist the year before. And at age 37 next season, what will go
next?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we have just as much talent as the Knicks,'' Gill
added. ``We just have to keep everybody healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Jayson Williams, the rebounder whose slow
recovery from a broken right leg might prevent him from starting
the season at full speed and full strength. But Van Horn's broken
left thumb has healed; a free agent after next season, he's hoping
to hit the NBA salary ceiling of $72 million over six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do what the Knicks did,'' Van Horn said. ``We have the
talent. We just have to put it together.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, a 6-foot-10-inch forward who averaged 21.8 points and
8.5 rebounds last season, acknowledged that the champion Spurs are
unique in having two 7-footers as dominating and determined as Tim
Duncan and David Robinson, but there's no other obvious challenger.
Not even the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we missed out on something,'' Van Horn said. ``Watching
the Knicks built a fire under me, and I hope it did for my
teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Nets were a sad 16-34 last season, including an
improved 13-17 after Casey took command, Marbury remembered that
the Spurs struggled to a 6-8 start before streaking through the
rest of the schedule and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't chase the ring,'' Marbury said. ``You have to really
work for it. It takes hard work. It takes effort. It takes luck. We
have a great situation now. We're young. We're talented and we're
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets are happy because Don Casey is their coach, but in the
NBA, happiness isn't everything. The team across the river proved
that. &QL;

 NEW YORK: the Bronx.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday night, after making sure Edwin showered and buying him
some in-line skates, Basora went with the boy to the 43rd Precinct
nearby. Edwin slept there Sunday night and Monday he gorged on
hamburgers and ice cream and slept some more.
</P>
<P>
   Eyleen Schmidt, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Washington, said that Edwin may have
several options for remaining in the United States, depending on
his father's status.
</P>
<P>
   If the father is in the country legally, he may petition to have
his son join him. If he is not here legally, he may apply up until
July 5 for a temporary work permit through a six-month-old federal
program intended for Honduran immigrants in the aftermath of
Hurricane Mitch. Ms. Schmidt said that the immigration agency would
then recommend that Edwin be allowed to stay with his father for as
long as the work permit is valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very determined to get to New York and it convinced
us,'' Jimenez, from the cafeteria in Miami, said. ``He was telling
us the truth. He only wanted to meet his father because that was
the only thing he had left in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said they are monitoring an overpass near LaGuardia
Airport because they believe Vasquez, the boy's father, may have
meant that location for the meeting with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the police, the children's services
agency and his office would do what they could to find Vasquez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do the best that we can to try to help him,'' the mayor
said. ``I think that's the only fair and decent thing to do.''

LIKUD DECIDES NOT TO JOIN A COALITION LED BY BARAK
</HEADLINE>

 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The rightist Likud Party withdrew Monday from
coalition talks with Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, announcing
that it would not join his government and was headed for the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The move defined the contours of Barak's emerging coalition as
he negotiated into the night with Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party of
Sephardic Jews that is the third-largest faction in Parliament and
a likely key partner in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who won a resounding victory over Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu as the Labor Party candidate in the election on May 17,
has already reached coalition agreements with three parties. An
accord with Shas, along with expected agreements with three more
parties, would give Barak a 77-seat majority in the 120-member
Parliament. He has until July 8 to form a government.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of talks with Likud came amid reports that Barak
had decided instead on a deal with Shas, whose relatively dovish
positions on peace talks and territorial compromise with the
Palestinians contrast with Likud's harder line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to say that the partnership offered us was not a
true partnership,'' Ariel Sharon, the acting head of Likud, said
after a five-minute meeting Monday with Barak. ``We don't see a
possibility of entering the government. We will fight this
government from the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon cited disagreements over a withdrawal from the Golan
Heights as part of a peace deal with Syria, and over construction
of housing for Jews in Arab areas of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Barak's One Israel bloc reportedly objected to the
inclusion of Likud in the government on the grounds that its
hawkish positions would hamper peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition agreements already signed by Barak have signaled a
change in domestic priorities, removing two key ministries from the
control of religious parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Ministry, controlled for years by the National
Religious Party, was assigned to Yossi Sarid, head of the leftist
and secular Meretz Party. The ministry has the second largest
budget after the Defense Ministry, and Barak has promised to make
education one of the highest priorities of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry, controlled by Shas for the last 15 years,
was assigned to a Natan Sharansky, the leader of the Russian
immigrant party, Yisrael Ba'Aliya. The party had demanded control
of the ministry, which registers immigrants as Jews and awards them
Israeli citizenship. Under the stewardship of Shas, the ministry
has questioned the Judaism of many of the new arrivals, refusing to
register them as Jews and even deporting some of them.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shas has been stripped of the Interior Ministry, it is
expected to be awarded four ministries in Barak's coalition. Meretz
originally opposed the inclusion of Shas after the party's leader,
Aryeh Deri, was convicted and sentenced to jail for bribery. But
Deri has since stepped down, and leaders of Meretz indicated Monday
that they no longer ruled out serving in a coalition with Shas.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some 113 years ago, when the Statue of Liberty began
advertising New York's affection for huddled masses, probably no
one envisioned just how much of a multitude might show up one muggy
day in midtown, or that so many of them would come carrying cameras
by car or stretch limo.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what happened Monday as a confluence of cultural,
political and gustatory events in Times Square made it truly seem
like the crossroads of the world, or at least its most
celebrity-studded corner.
</P>
<P>
   There was starlock at the premiere of Spike Lee's new movie,
``Summer of Sam,'' with craning fans packed in six deep on West
44th Street.
</P>
<P>
   There was squealing inside the Official All-Star Cafe, at
Broadway and 45th Street, as Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter and
several of his teammates held a benefit for children.
</P>
<P>
   As for 46th Street, it was entirely closed for a two-block
stretch between Ninth Avenue and Broadway as some 12,000 people
came to sample the fare of three dozen restaurants at the annual
Taste of Times Square street festival.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, one block away, President Clinton and some
corporate heavy hitters attended a special matinee performance of
the ``The Iceman Cometh'' at the Brooks Atkinson Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just another day in Times Square,'' sighed Brendan Sexton,
head of the Times Square Business Improvement District, one of
several officials who pretended to be unfazed by the idea that a
single section of the city, over four hours, had hosted enough
special events to entertain another municipality for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing like this,'' said Edward Hanrahan, of
Chesapeake, Va., who stood with his wife and seven children on a
storefront window ledge, trying to catch a glimpse of stars like
Jennifer Lopez as they headed into Lee's movie, which premiered at
7 p.m. ``We have Octoberfest. We have Harborfest. We have stars
coming in once in awhile. But not like this. This is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The menu of events would have been even longer, but the
incendiary Ricky Martin, a singer whose performance outside
Rockefeller Center drew thousands of frenzied fans earlier this
month, canceled an appearance on the Late Show with David
Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the panoply of events and moments of pandemonium were
such that hardly anyone noticed a crew filming an episode of the
television show ``Law and Order'' on Ninth Avenue. And the 130
people who packed Broadway outside the 45th Street studios of MTV
to scream at their favorite personalities seemed like a small
sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   As exciting as it was for some, it was not a day to drive a car
or to be caught in the crush on a Times Square sidewalk, where the
sweltering temperatures and honking horns turned a trip for a
sandwich into an urban endurance test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really inconvenient and really unsafe,'' offered Bill
Kavanah, an operations manager for the city's Off-Track Betting
Corp. as he tried to navigate West 44th Street. ``I remember when
we had the muggers and the pimps. It was dangerous, but it wasn't
like having some tourist push you in front of a bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who arrived at 3 p.m., carried most of the blame for
the traffic mess. His visit forced the closing of 42nd Street and
Eighth Avenue for a portion of the afternoon and a stretch of 47th
Street for the entire day.

NATIONAL PARKS MAY BE ROOMIER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those eager to see national-park attractions they have been
reluctant to tackle, from Old Faithful at Yellowstone to the
Grinnell Glacier at Glacier Park, from the Sequoias in California
to Acadia in Maine, this is a particularly fortunate year. Getting
in may be less of a problem than in past years.
</P>
<P>
   The national park system, after years of increases in numbers of
visitors, expects a leveling-off this year, to a mere 286.6
million, virtually the same as in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Amfac Parks and Resorts of Colorado, which operates
the lodges at the Grand Canyon as well as in Everglades and other
popular national parks, says this flat rate _ and an already
apparent drop in visits to parks in the Southwest _ is due to a
decline in tourists from Asia, to a perception that the parks are
overcrowded, and possibly to confusion about future changes in
automobile access at the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of park visitors are from other countries, and
these travelers are a function of the American economy, said David
Barna, a spokesman for the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a cheap visit anymore,'' he said, and that is what
tourists are seeking at a time of recession in Asia and economic
problems in northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign visitors have always focused on the best-known national
parks. As Barna said, when tour organizers try to tell foreigners
that the less-crowded parks might be interesting or fun, they
usually respond: ``When you come to Paris, you do not want to go
see other towers. you want to see the Eiffel Tower.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the drop in international visitors is most affecting the
iconic parks: Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite. Grand Canyon
recorded 5 million visitors in 1997; that figure dropped 11 percent
in 1998 and is expected to fall another 6 percent this year, to
under 4.2 million. Yellowstone is expected to drop 3.5 percent this
year, and Yosemite 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not every park will be gasping for business, because in many
places the pressure is still climbing. But a burst of repairs and
additions to hotels, coupled with slowed demand, meant that late in
June, reservations at the major park hotels were still showing an
average of 10 percent availability for July and August.
</P>
<P>
   That softness does not apply to campsite reservations. The
company that handles phone and Internet camping and
recreational-vehicle reservations at the busiest parks said that
reservations were holding steady against last year. One sales
representative said that campgrounds wouldn't be hit by a fall in
foreign tourists because they are usually booked into park hotels
rather than campgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a roundup of changes in national parks this year,
including a report on the impact of fires at Joshua Tree National
Park in California. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone's New Rooms
</P>
<P>
   The Old Faithful Snow Lodge, within walking distance of Old
Faithful geyser, is an important addition to visitor housing at
Yellowstone, the first national park. Half of the 100 rooms opened
a year ago, and the other half this May, when the hotel was
dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing a building originally intended as employee housing, it
was built by Amfac, the concessionaire, and the Park Service, using
recycled timbers and low-energy fixtures. The architecture is in
the style used for the early lodges in the parks. Like Mammoth Hot
Springs Hotel in Yellowstone, the Snow Lodge is also open for a
midwinter season. Rooms range from $101 to $141 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Dunraven Lodge, near the Yellowstone Grand Canyon, is even
newer, having opened June 14. The 44 rooms, all with private bath,
replace cabins built in the 1960s. Rates are $105 a night, double
or single.
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant at the registration area serves the Dunraven and
the Cascade Lodge and nearby cabins. Reservations at Yellowstone
may be made at (307) 344-7311 or on the Web at
www.travelyellowstone.com.
</P>
<P>
   At Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada of California, the
concessionaire, Delaware North Parks Services, has opened the new
Wuksachi Lodge. This year-round hotel, with 102 rooms with private
baths, opened on Memorial Day weekend. Some rooms have sitting-room
areas with sliding doors and convertible sofas, attractive to
families.
</P>
<P>
   The rates are $110 to $155 in the peak season. The Wuksachi has
a restaurant on the premises that is available to day visitors as
well as guests. Reservations: (888) 252-5757.
</P>
<P>
   The Wuksachi and the smaller John Muir Lodge in adjoining Kings
Canyon National Park provide lodging to replace 200 old cabins,
lodges and shops that are being removed from the Giant
Forest-Lodgepole area under a 1980 park development plan. The John
Muir has 30 rooms, 6 of them suites, all with baths, with rates
starting at $125 a night for the standard rooms.
</P>
<P>
   There is no restaurant in this small lodge; guests can take
meals in the restaurant that serves all lodges in the Grant Grove
area. Reservations: Kings Canyon Park Services, (559) 335-5500. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grand Canyon Plans
</P>
<P>
   Completion of a new transportation system for Grand Canyon
National Park is still some time off, although ground was broken
this spring for the new Canyon View information plaza. The goal, as
with many other long-term national park plans, is to reduce the
number of private cars by offering other choices that are less
damaging to the environment and the air quality.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, according to Sandra Perl in the park office, a six-mile
light-rail transit system will link a parking lot at Tusayan,
outside the south park entrance, to the new information plaza near
Mather Point.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From there, visitors will be able to board shuttles running on
an alternative fuel, ride a bicycle (they will be available for
rent) or a wheelchair, push a stroller or walk to the Greenway
along the north and south rims.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Hillary Rodham Clinton visited the Grand Canyon park to
inaugurate work on the Greenway, which covers 73 miles. The
information plaza is scheduled to be finished in September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But when this is all done, park officials and Amfac point out,
people with reservations in the lodges will still be able to take
their cars into the park, either directly to lodges that are away
from the rim, or to parking lots where shuttles will pick up guests
for the lodges at the rim. At the moment, autombile access
continues as before.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Canyon lodge reservations are available at (303) 297-2757,
or at www.amfac.com. Some specials for the Grand Canyon were posted
on the site in mid-June. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aftermath of Wildfires
</P>
<P>
   Four wildfires at Joshua Tree, set by lightning, consumed 13,000
acres in 96 hours in late May, according to Ernest Quintana, the
superintendent. ``Parts of the park may look a bit scruffy for a
while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the areas closed while the fire was fought were reopened
by Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Zarki, the chief of interpretation, said that most visitors
to Joshua Tree in late June were from overseas and that his staff
was making every effort to explain about the fire and the Park
Service's new policy on handling wildfires, which emphasizes
techniques that are ``light on the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are moving along in East Coast parks, too. North
Carolina's Cape Hatteras Lighthouse began a 2,900-foot journey back
from the ocean in mid-June. It will take at least six weeks to get
the lighthouse, 4,800 tons of it, onto steel tracks and over to a
new, safer spot, where it will be lowered onto a new foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The lighthouse will be closed to visitors, but the process will
be visible through frequently replenished pictures at
www.nsp.gov/caha/lrp.htm. The Park Service hopes to have the
lighthouse open again by next Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   At Acadia National Park in Maine, a propane-powered bus system
began its first summer of free runs two weeks ago, making circuits
of the park with calls at the Bar Harbor airport, motels and ferry
landings.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have visited the main section of Acadia, on Mount
Desert Island, know that automobile traffic is a bane. The
procession through the park dissipates pleasure in the
surroundings. If you can find a parking spot in Bar Harbor, the
main town, it is difficult to avoid a parking ticket because the
limit is two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The bus system, called the Island Explorer, will operate eight
vehicles on six routes every day until Sept. 6. Each bus can carry
28 passengers and 5 bicycles. For bike riders, being able to get
into the park with their bikes means that they need not pedal the
whole 20-mile loop at once, but can get in and pick the route they
want.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers, too, can pick up another bus to leave the park. Campers
using Blackwoods Campground will get from Bar Harbor Airport to the
campground in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen agencies, including the state and federal Departments of
Transportation, and several towns in the area contributed to the
Island Explorer project. The buses are operated by Downeast
Transportation, a local nonprofit bus company.
</P>
<P>
   A Free Acadia Shuttles flier will be available at hotels, shops,
the airport, ferry terminals and elsewhere. Information: (207)
667-5796. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reserving Campsites &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reservations for camping in the most popular national park areas
are handled separately from lodge reservations, by a company under
contract to the government, Biospherics in Beltsville, Md. Here are
the phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   For Yosemite in California, reservations open on the 15th of
each month for camping up to five months later; call (800)
436-7275.
</P>
<P>
   For the following parks, reservations open the 5th of each month
for camping up to five months later; call (800) 365-2267: Acadia in
Maine, Assateague in Maryland and Virginia, Cape Hatteras in North
Carolina, Channel Islands in California, Chickasaw in Oklahoma,
Death Valley in California, Everglades in Florida, Glacier in
Montana, Grand Canyon in Arizona, Great Smoky Mountains in
Tennessee and North Carolina, Greenbelt in Maryland, Gulf Islands
in Florida and Mississippi, Joshua Tree in California, Katmai in
Alaska, Mount Rainier in Washington, Rocky Mountain in Colorado,
Sequoia-Kings Canyon in California, Sleeping Bear Dunes in
Michigan, Shenandoah in Virginia, Whiskeytown in California and
Zion in Utah.

GENERAL ILLUMINATES '68 MASSACRE IN MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For three decades, one of Mexico's most explosive
secrets has been the identity of the snipers who carried out the
country's worst massacre since the 1910 Revolution, firing machine
guns from rooftops into a crowd of peaceful protesters on the eve
of the 1968 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Now newly published documents, signed by the general who was
Mexico's defense minister at the time, appear to have cleared up
the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The snipers were plainclothes members of the Presidential
General Staff, an elite army unit that protects Mexican presidents,
according to the documents, written and signed by Gen. Marcelino
Garcia Barragan. The documents suggest that the orders for the
snipers to shoot on the crowd were issued by President Gustavo Diaz
Ordaz.
</P>
<P>
   One mystery that remains is how many snipers there were. The
documents refer to at least 10 and previous documents said scores
of suspected snipers had been arrested. No one was ever charged.
</P>
<P>
   Successive Mexican governments have always blamed the
demonstrators for the violence. The government originally said that
29 people died in the bloodshed at the Plaza of Three Cultures, a
broad courtyard surrounded by high-rise buildings in the Tlatelolco
housing complex in downtown Mexico City, but others put the count
far higher. An American diplomat at the time estimated that nearly
200 died.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, a consensus formed among historians that the
government had orchestrated the violence to justify a broader
crackdown on protesters, who were considered an embarrassment
before the 1968 Olympics. But never before have documents,
originating within the government elite, detailed so explicitly who
issued the orders and who carried them out.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Barragan died in 1979. He wrote the documents as a kind
of memoir in the years after the 1968 massacre. One, which he
penned in his own hand as a letter to his son, was titled ``The
Truth for History.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents are published in a forthcoming book, ``Parte de
Guerra. Tlatelolco 1968'' or ``war report,'' written by Julio
Scherer Garcia and Carlos Monsivais, both prominent intellectuals.
Garcia Barragan's family shared the documents with Scherer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These documents are of extraordinary importance, because they
fill one of the largest gaps in our knowledge of the 1968
violence,'' Sergio Aguayo, a historian who wrote a 1998 book on the
massacre, said Monday ``This is the first time that the identity of
the snipers has been confirmed with documents from within the
military.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the documents refer to conversations that Garcia
Barragan had the night of the violence, Oct. 2, 1968, with Gen.
Crisoforo Mazon Pineda, the commander of a Mexico City army brigade
whose troops had been sent to the protest rally at Tlatelolco and
came under fire from rooftop snipers, some of whom were arrested
and identified themselves as soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Another conversation was with Gen. Luis Gutierrez Oropeza,
commander of the Presidential General Staff, who worked directly
for Diaz Ordaz.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 7 or 8 p.m., Gen. Crisoforo Mazon Pineda asked me for
authorization to search the apartments from which the snipers were
still firing on the troops,'' Garcia Barragan wrote in one of the
documents. ``The authorization was given. Only 15 minutes had gone
by when I received a call from Gen. Oropeza, commander of the
Presidential General Staff, who said to me, `My general, I put
officers armed with machine guns to shoot on the students. All of
them succeeded in getting out of there, only two were unable to get
away. They're in civilian clothes, I'm afraid for their lives.
Don't you want to order that their lives be respected?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you inform me about the officers you're referring
to?'' Garcia Barragan said he asked Oropeza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because those were my orders, my general,'' Oropeza replied,
according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Monday in the newspaper Reforma,
Oropeza, who is 80, denied any responsibility for the 1968
massacre. ``I worked directly for President Diaz Ordaz,'' he said.
``I had nothing to do with that Oct. 2 mess.''
</P>
<P>
   In another document, Garcia Barragan refers to ``terrorists''
who had fired their weapons earlier in 1968, during street
demonstrations protesting the army's takeover of the National
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those terrorists were officers of the Presidential General
Staff who received training for that type of operation,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the massacre, officers of the Presidential General
Staff rented apartments in the buildings surrounding the Plaza of
Three Cultures to use as machine gun nests, Garcia Barragan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A smiling Diaz Ordaz once told Oropeza that Garcia Barragan
appeared, naively, to believe that Oropeza had issued unilateral
orders for the snipers to shoot on the crowd, without the
president's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never tell,'' Oropeza said he told the president in a
later recounting of the incident to a military colleague, who in
turn told Garcia Barragan.

 &HT;    Dayton awaits NCAA recommendation on violations
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ University of Dayton athletics director Ted
Kissell said Monday it will probably be mid-July before the school
learns whether the NCAA recommends that violations involving its
men's basketball program are major or minor.
</P>
<P>
   UD officials had hoped to hear from the NCAA enforcement staff
this month on whether it believes improper loans by UD trustee and
booster Clayton L. Mathile to the father of a top recruit are
considered a major infraction. But Kissell said delays have
resulted, in part, because NCAA officials are in the midst of a
move from Kansas to their new offices in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The delay) is not anything that reflects that the process has
become more complex,'' Kissell said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said a recent report in the Dayton Daily News about
a truck lease to Brooks Hall from UD booster Frank Z Chevrolet
``raised issues'' that the NCAA asked the university to look into.
Kissell said that inquiry took additional time but, ``There is no
reason to believe that there is any impropriety with the lease. And
we have reported that to NCAA enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The university first announced in April that it had
self-reported two violations, which it considered ``secondary'' or
minor, to the NCAA in December: the two loans from Mathile to Chuck
Hall, father of UD recruit Brooks Hall of Troy; and ``impermissible
contact'' between Chuck Hall and Mathile. The NCAA then launched
its own investigation, which has included visits to Dayton to
conduct interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Kissell said a report in the Dayton Daily News about how Hall
repaid the loan _ through an unusual second mortgage worth $32,000
from KeyBank, where UD trustee Mervyn L. Alphonso is the Dayton
district president _ has not slowed the NCAA's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That repayment had already been part of the self-report,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kissell said to his knowledge the NCAA ``has not alleged any
further violations'' other than the two the university originally
reported. But he said the university won't know all of the details
until the enforcement staff completes the process.

   Kissell said Brooks Hall remains eligible to play for UD next
season and unless the NCAA ``finds something new,'' that shouldn't
change.
</P>
<P>
   If the enforcement staff decided that a major infraction has
occurred, UD could be notified informally or through an Official
Letter of Inquiry, according to NCAA enforcement director Chuck
Smrt. The official letter would outline the NCAA's allegations and
the university would be invited to respond. If school officials
disagreed with the allegations, they could appear before the
Committee on Infractions, which rules on the enforcement staff's
recommendation and metes out punishment.
</P>
<P>
   If UD officials agreed with the NCAA enforcement staff's
conclusions, they could avoid the Infractions Committee hearing and
go straight to the sanctions phase.

 NEW YORK: entire day.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This is a pain in the neck,'' said Walter Angulo, 29, of On
Time Delivery Services, who was having a hard time keeping his
company's promise as he waited 20 minutes in his van on West 44th
Street for the president's motorcade to pass. ``I can't even cross
Eighth Avenue to drop off my work.''
</P>
<P>
   Angulo was among the hundreds who converted the side streets
into a sea of cell phones, as they related their delays to
superiors. City officials say crosstown traffic speeds are
improving, but Monday afternoon the traffic flow could still be
measured in snail time.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was difficult to accurately calculate the traffic
volumes, Joan Eisman, a painter from Brooklyn, had fashioned her
own sort of measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep trying to see things that I was seeing the other day
and you can't see them,'' she said, peering north from an island in
the middle of Broadway to adjust her painting of the square. ``The
traffic lights used to give you a clear view every seven and a half
minutes. Not today.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Littler, general manager of the Millennium Broadway
Hotel on West 44th Street, noted the one silver lining to a Times
Square traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least the people stuck in the cars have something to
watch,'' he said, ``like the signs and all the people, ranging from
sober-suited business people like me to people with purple hair and
most parts of their body pierced with something.''
</P>
<P>
   Littler's business is among those affected when the streets
become parking lots. But Monday he displayed that classic New York
what-me-worry attitude, realizing perhaps as a hotelier that many
of the hassles were signs of a city in renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disruption in the area is part of the pattern of what
Times Square is all about,'' he said. ``There is nothing
predictable about the area except that it is unpredictable and
busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials also took the day's travails in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no nightmare,'' said Chief Allan H. Hoehl, the
commander of police in southern Manhattan who directs everything
from ticker tape parades to the ball-drop on New Year's Eve. ``It's
all part of the informal entertainment of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the police, the primary focus was the president, who was in
town to raise money for Democratic congressional campaigns. After
the benefit performance at the theater, Clinton moved down the
street by foot to the Supper Club where a second fund-raiser was
held. Outside, in the middle of 47th Street, one officer
entertained the crowd on a megaphone, trying to convince them to
clear the street as he ticked off the many parades and events that
had been staged in midtown in just the past three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to New York City,'' he concluded. ``This is just a
typical day here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, it was a dark day for Broadway theaters, or the
crowds would have been more fearsome. Indeed, the sponsors of the
food festival on West 46th Street had picked the date a year ago
knowing there was no chance their guests would be trampled by
people with Playbills. Then, 10 days ago, word began to drift in
about other events. The Times Square Business Improvement District
planners put together a memo listing the lineup of the events
(their longest ever), and sent it to all the building managers and
hotels in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to plan and then plan for the unplanned,'' said
Sexton. ``The president usually does not call us up to check before
he drops by.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If they all seemed a bit blase at the improvement district,
Sexton said it was because it is hard to speak in superlatives when
it comes to a place of true history like Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will anything ever equal VJ day?''

PACT REACHED ON DOWNLOADING OF DIGITAL MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS and MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of struggle over the future of music distribution,
the music and electronics industries announced an agreement Monday
that will enable electronics makers to begin mass production of
portable digital music players while technology to protect against
piracy is still being developed.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gives the record industry what it wanted in the
long run: a standard that will ultimately prevent the playing of
illegally duplicated music on digital devices. But in the short
run, it has agreed to the manufacture of devices capable of playing
pirated music.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry was under heavy pressure from the
electronics industry to come up with a standard by June 30, in time
to get portable devices into stores by Christmas. And record
companies themselves, responding to a grass-roots boom in the
digital distribution of music over the Internet, had announced a
flurry of deals in recent months intended to grab a share of the
digital market.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement came from a consortium called the Secure
Digital Music Initiative, representing more than 100 companies from
the recording, home electronics and technology industries
worldwide. It said the agreement would be submitted for
ratification at a meeting in Los Angeles next week.
</P>
<P>
   Record industry officials said they had grudgingly acceded to
the standard. Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording
Industry Association of America, the trade group representing the
industry, called it ``a substantial compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's also premised on a reality,'' he said. ``The reality
is that a collaborative approach working with the tech industry to
appeal to consumers is the greatest business opportunity for
everyone.'' Several electronics manufacturers intend to begin
production of portable devices based on the standard, which could
become as ubiquitous as cassette-based portable players.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said the recording industry had to concede that the
market is demanding such devices _ specifically players capable of
recording and playing popular MP3 files, which are not copyright
protected. He said the recording industry calculated that it would
pay to cooperate with electronics manufacturers in exchange for
more secure distribution in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The standard, devised by a working group that has met several
times a month, is to be carried out in two phases. In the first
phase, devices complying with the standard will be permitted to
play any type of file, whether or not it is illegally copied.
</P>
<P>
   But the devices must include technology that will permit them to
be modified once anti-piracy technology is ready, probably in the
form of a digital watermark embedded in legitimate digital
recordings, whether distributed on CD or over the Internet. Once
that second phase takes effect _ probably not for 18 months _ users
will be asked to ``upgrade'' the players to enable them to play
legitimately copied music that has been recorded under the new
system.
</P>
<P>
   There is one catch. The recording industry conceded that even
once the anti-piracy technology is in place, devices using the
approved standard will not be able to block out illegal copies of
songs already recorded.
</P>
<P>
   This means that millions of CDs already in existence can be
loaded onto computers, uploaded onto the Internet and traded, and
downloaded onto portable players _ even if the recipient has not
paid for a licensed copy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Sherman said, record companies will forgo hefty
potential revenues. ``For some companies we're talking about giving
away a musical heritage,'' said Sherman. ``Think about Elvis, think
about the Beatles _ we're talking about giving away the catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the first meetings of the consortium in January, there has
been heavy debate between technology companies, which want to
develop products that will be easy for consumers to use; record
companies, which originally wanted to make products that would not
be compatible with existing digital music formats like MP3, which
has no safeguards against piracy; and digital music users, who have
built a music playground on MP3. For Monday's agreement to work,
participants in the meetings say, these three parties need to be
willing to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Samit, the senior vice president of EMI (with a catalog that
includes the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones), said
that the label planned to have ``as much music as is humanly
possible'' available in approved digital form by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of portable electronics were more cautious. ``We
are preparing our future products to be compliant, but it would be
premature to say that they definitely will be because we need to
see the final specifications and ratify them first,'' said Chris
Smith, the program manager at Creative Labs, which already has a
digital music player on the market, the Nomad.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the recording industry association sued to stop sales
of another portable digital music player, the Rio, asserting that
it did not comply with the Digital Home Recording Act. A federal
court dismissed the lawsuit two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio's manufacturer, Diamond Multimedia, which has sold more
than 100,000 of the devices, said it intended to comply with
Monday's agreement and that the standard should ultimately be good
for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a customer and had to choose between compliant and
noncompliant devices, I'd definitely choose the compliant one,''
said Lorraine Comstock, a company spokeswoman. She said the company
planned a new portable player that will record and play both
existing MP3 music and files complying with the new standard.

   (NYT22) NEW YORK -- June 28, 1999 -- NY-CHAOS-FOR-A-DAY, 6-28 --
Police motorcycles, part of President Clinton's motorcade, are seen
parked near Times Square on Monday. President Clinton and some
corporate heavy hitters were attending a special matinee
performance nearby of the ``The Iceman Cometh.'' Some 113 years
ago, when the Statue of Liberty began advertising New York's
affection for huddled masses, no one probably envisioned just how
much of a multitude might show up one muggy day in midtown, or that
so many of them would come carrying cameras by car or stretch limo.

Edwin Daniel Sabillion, 13, after in police custody on Monday.
Sabillion desperately wanted to leave his Honduran village,
devastated last year by Hurricane Mitch, to be with his father in
New York City. So his father sent him $200 and said to meet him at
LaGuardia Airport on June 28. Edwin hitchhiked and walked his way
north in a journey which took him a month. On Sunday, Sabillion
arrived in the city and asked a cab driver to take him to the
airport. The driver, thinking the boy was a runaway, called police.
Investigators are now trying to track down the boy's father, whose
phone number the boy had lost on his long journey northward. (Susan

PRESSURE MOUNTS AS FRONTIER WEIGHS QWEST BID
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frontier Corp., one of the nation's largest
long-distance telephone companies, said Monday that it was
continuing to evaluate the unsolicited offer made two weeks ago by
Qwest Communications International.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier did not say when it would make a decision about the
offer. But there was speculation last week that Frontier's
directors would decide at Monday's regularly scheduled meeting
whether Qwest's recently revised offer was attractive enough for
the company to discuss a merger with Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13, Qwest said that it was making unsolicited offers
then valued at $55 billion for both Frontier and U S West, the
smallest of the regional Bell companies. Both companies have
already agreed to be acquired by Global Crossing Ltd., the
Bermuda-based telecommunications upstart, which agreed to buy
Frontier in March and U S West in May.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of their agreements, the boards of Frontier and
U S West have to decide whether Qwest's offer is superior to
Global's before they can share financial information with Qwest. U
S West's board is expected to meet this week.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the two companies have reaffirmed their
commitment to the Global Crossing deal, saying they would take no
action on Qwest's offers. As a result, Qwest revised its bid on
Wednesday, raising the price and adding a price protection in the
event Qwest's stock price drops. That was necessary, people close
to the talks said, when Qwest's stock plummeted 24 percent the day
after it was announced and investors panned the combination.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing is offering Frontier shareholders $63 a share in
Global stock and U S West stockholders about $60 a share in stock.
Qwest is offering Frontier shareholders $68 in stock and cash and U
S West shareholders $69 in stock or cash. But there are several
issues both boards will have to consider besides price, including
regulatory risks, the deal's structure and the strategic rationale
of the combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier also announced Monday that its second quarter and 1999
revenue and earnings results would fall short of analysts'
expectations because of lower prices for long-distance phone
service. Frontier said it expected to earn 20 to 22 cents a share
in the second quarter and about $1 for the full year. Frontier was
previously expected to earn 28 cents a share for the quarter and
$1.19 for the year, the average estimates of analysts polled by the
First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, a report on CNBC indicated that Frontier
could be blaming Qwest, in part, for the current earnings
shortfall. Qwest is helping build Frontier's network and there were
delays last year. But Rolla Huff, Frontier's president and chief
operating officer, dispelled that notion, saying, ``The thing that
has affected earnings is the long-distance market over all.'' The
earnings shortfall is not expected to affect the merger agreement
with Global Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest said it would not revise its offer based on Monday's news,
asking Frontier for a ``prompt affirmation so we can proceed
together. Time, of course, is of the essence to us and the Frontier
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Since announcing its hostile offer, it seems Qwest has had to
deal with such market rumors or comments almost every day. On
Thursday, for instance, a report by Bloomberg News quoted Reed
Hundt, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission,
saying that a combination between Qwest and U S West ``would take
an exceedingly long time to travel the regulatory minefield and it
may well blow up trying.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Joseph Nacchio, Qwest's chief executive, sent a
letter to Solomon Trujillo, U S West chief executive, saying, there
were ``no minefields'' and indicating that any regulatory concerns
could be addressed in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio spent Monday in New York, attending meetings with
investors to gain further support for his bids.
</P>
<P>
   But he has already sent a letter to investors that he would
consider a hostile battle or other alternatives in his quest for
Frontier and U S West.  &QL;

Sabillion desperately wanted to leave his Honduran village,

New York City. So his father sent him $200 and said to meet him at
LaGuardia Airport on June 28. Edwin hitchhiked and walked his way
north in a journey which took him a month. On Sunday, Sabillion
arrived in the city and asked a cab driver to take him to the
airport. The driver, thinking the boy was a runaway, called police.
Investigators are now trying to track down the boy's father, whose
phone number the boy had lost on his long journey northward. (Susan

   (NYT19) NEW YORK -- June 28, 1999 -- NY-HONDURAN-IMMIG, 6-28 --
Edwin Daniel Sabillion, 13, after in police custody on Monday.
Sabillion desperately wanted to leave his Honduran village,
devastated last year by Hurricane Mitch, to be with his father in
New York City. So his father sent him $200 and said to meet him at
LaGuardia Airport on June 28. Edwin hitchhiked and walked his way
north in a journey which took him a month. On Sunday, Sabillion
arrived in the city and asked a cab driver to take him to the
airport. The driver, thinking the boy was a runaway, called police.
Investigators are now trying to track down the boy's father, whose
phone number the boy had lost on his long journey northward. (Susan

UNSEEDED DOKIC, AGE 16, MARCHES TO QUARTERFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 BY ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ She's sweet 16, but here on the courts of
Wimbledon, where a succession of showers compromised the progress
of the Round of 16, Jelena Dokic continued to unveil a
take-no-prisoners scheme Monday that vaulted her into her first
Grand Slam quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   Dokic, ranked 129th in the world, used a 6-4, 6-3 upset of
ninth-seeded Mary Pierce to become the lowest-ranked qualifier to
reach Wimbledon's quarterfinals since 154th-ranked Molly Van
Nostrand gate-crashed 14 years ago. And Dokic, last year's junior
U.S. Open champion, was not satisfied yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want more; hopefully I'll go a bit further,'' Dokic said.
Her quarterfinal opponent has yet to be determined because of the
postponement of the Round of 16 clash between two Americans, the
veteran doubles specialist Lisa Raymond and 18-year-old Alexandra
Stevenson, like Dokic a main-draw neophyte with designs on the
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to think you're unbeatable,'' said Dokic, an
Australian who has been a professional for all of six months.
``It's anybody's tournament now.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other women to advance before rain ruined the day were
third-seeded Lindsay Davenport, who turned aside six set points in
the opening set before overwhelming 13th-seeded Barbara Schett, 7-6
(9-7), 6-1, and Wimbledon's 31-year-old defending champion, Jana
Novotna, who eliminated Nathalie Dechy of France, 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi, the 1992 Wimbledon champion, who reactivated his
Grand Slam aspirations by claiming the French Open title three
weeks ago, found himself challenged by another Australian
qualifier, 163d-ranked Wayne Arthurs, and his 25 aces. However once
Agassi was able to draw a bead on the serve of the left-handed
Arthurs, he reached the quarterfinals with a 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-5),
6-1, 6-4 comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi said he was careful not to underrate Arthurs, who at 28
qualified for his first Wimbledon this year and made it all the way
to Agassi in the Round of 16, a run of 111 games, before dropping
serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to win if you can't break somebody,'' said
Agassi, who finally did in the third game of the third set. ``I
didn't expect the versatility in his serve; I was expecting a
significant amount of pace and ability to close out the volley. I
mean, he's Australian, so if he didn't know how to volley, well,
he'd lose his passport. But this was a dangerous match for me, and
I gave him that kind of respect going out there, and I'm glad I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi will be taking a respectful attitude into the next round,
too, because his opponent, Gustavo Kuerten, the 1997 French Open
champion, holds a 2-1 edge in career meetings and appears to be
suddenly simpatico with this surface.
</P>
<P>
   Monday the 11th-seeded Kuerten, whose four-spot downgrade by the
seeding committee was evidently an oversight, fired 15 aces and
converted seven of nine break points to knock out Lorenzo Manta,
7-5, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Dokic, whose appetite for victories and upsets seems
unlimited, Davenport expressed relief about reaching her Wimbledon
goal, the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get through to the quarters was my goal here, and I'm just
so happy that it's over with,'' said Davenport, the reigning United
States Open champion, who describes her grass court game as
``average.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be good sometimes,'' she said. ``It depends which day
it is. You know, the grass is naturally going to favor a person who
has a very good slice and can come into the net and covering it
well, and that's Novotna,'' her next hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost feel like I have nothing to lose now,'' said
Davenport, who has a 5-0 record against the fifth-seeded Novotna.
``To play the defending champion _ this is obviously her best
surface, but I like playing her. It will be interesting to see how
it goes on grass.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the astounding breakthrough made here by three teen-age
qualifiers, Dokic, Stevenson, and Holland's Kim Clijsters, who
trailed seven-time champion Steffi Graf by 6-2, 4-2 when play was
suspended by rain, Davenport termed it ``a big turning of the
guard, probably a first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting through to the later rounds of Grand Slams, that's
sometimes the toughest thing to do,'' said the 23-year-old
Davenport. ``I don't feel like I'm old. I'm still in the middle of
my career; sometimes experience can help you a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes experience bows to youthful ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Dokic had already become the youngest and lowest-ranked player
ever to dislodge a top-seeded player in a Grand Slam opener when
she routed her role model, Martina Hingis, in the first round.
Dokic had vowed to show Pierce the same lack of deference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure on me,'' Dokic said. ``I mean, I've come
from qualifying and come from nowhere. This was a big match for me,
Mary being top 10 and a seed here, and beating Hingis is probably
still in my head. I'm thinking: `Well, did that really happen? Am I
really able to beat top players?' Then beating Mary today sort of
proved it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Right down to her blond braid and plastic barrettes, Dokic
appeared to be a miniature version of Pierce, the strapping
powerhouse who has come to be known as ``the Body'' in tennis
circles ever since her disclosure earlier this month at the French
Open that creatine is her favorite booster supplement. And early in
their encounter, Dokic's game was dwarfed by Pierce's. But after
trailing by 4-1, Dokic regrouped and, with an on-court caginess
evocative of Hingis' best weapon, her intelligence, Dokic began to
batter Pierce with a barrage of snappy corner-to-corner
cross-hatching that exploited the bigger player's lack of mobility
and tested her patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like playing people that hit the ball hard and hit flat,
like Mary does,'' Dokic said. ``But if you look at Hingis, she
doesn't have a lot of power and they're twice the size that she is,
and you have to use their head and then outplay them that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Pierce refused to hang a mantle of great
expectations on the winner, saying only that ``time will tell''
whether Dokic's exploits here will be repeated on other surfaces,
she complimented the teen-ager's poise, positioning and shot
selection, all of which she deemed superior to her own on this
dreary, chilly, and windy day.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a good fighter,'' Pierce said. ``She never gave up. She
moves around the court really well. She likes to play aggressive,
come forward, take the ball early, and those are the type of
players I'm most challenged by.'' &QL;

COLOMBIA DEVALUES THE PESO BY 10 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Hurt by a steep economic decline and
speculative selling pressure on the peso, Colombia devalued its
national currency by 10 percent in an emergency decree that took
effect on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to ease the goverment-imposed exchange-rate limits
on the peso was made following an emergency meeting of the central
bank late Sunday night. The peso initially tumbled 2.9 percent on
Monday in reaction to the change, rebounding later to close at
1,743 to the dollar, about 0.7 percent weaker than its rate late
Friday. But there are widespread expectations that the currency
will continue to weaken.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's move to devalue the peso was not unexpected, since
the currency has been under heavy selling pressure in recent weeks.
The government spent $275 million of its $8.5 billion in foreign
exchange reserves Thursday and Friday to defend the the peso's
value in the forreign-exchange market by purchasing pesos and
reducing the supply in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The peso's weakness reflects a deepening recession in Colombia
and the need for Colombian businesses to obtain dollars to pay
overseas debts. Earlier this month, both Standard &AMP; Poor's and
Moody's Investors Service put Colombia's credit rating on review,
in what was seen as a preliminary step to a likely downgrade to
below investment-grade.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia historically has recorded fairly steady economic growth
partly because of robust exports of coffee and oil, as well as the
cushion provided by illegal earnings from drug trafficking. But the
Colombian economy contracted by nearly 5 percent in the first
quarter of this year, a record decline that followed a 3.1 percent
shrinkage during the final quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing strength of both the left-wing guerrillas who
have been fighting the government for more than 30 years and
right-wing paramilitary groups has also weakened the economy and
made foreign investors nervous. Foreign investment in Colombia's
three main stock markets had dropped to $718 million by May of this
year, compared to $1.1 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident and calm that the market will accept this,''
Colombia's minister of finance, Juan Camilo Restrepo, said in
announcing the devaluation measures at a news conference late
Sunday night. ``It will be seen that there are serious, coherent
policies behind this move, and fiscal targets which are being
met.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, market analysts largely disagreed. They said the
government would have been better off abandoning the system of
artificial limits on exchange rates altogether in favor of letting
the peso rise and fall based on supply and demand.

 McMILLAN'S MISSILE OF A SHOT DEFIES GRAVITY  
(jt) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ The ball rocketed off Shannon MacMillan's right
foot from 19 yards out as it always does, sharply and with biting
movement, diving nastily and finally short-hopping into the North
Korean goal on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   There was only the smallest available room between Kye Yong Sun
and the left post, but goalkeepers, unlike catchers, have no such
thing as bigger mitts to handle a knuckleball. Kye did what she
could, but she grabbed only a fistful of air with a flailing dive.
At the other end of the field, Briana Scurry felt elation for her
team and sympathy for a fellow goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate it,'' she said of MacMillan's shot. ``The ball moves
around. It knuckles and dips. She hits it harder than anyone on the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans won, 3-0, as MacMillan also assisted on a pair of
acrobatic headers by Tisha Venturini. But this start was only to
give another teammate a breather. When the Americans play in the
quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup on Thursday against Germany,
MacMillan and her knuckleball will return to the bullpen, available
as a closer or in middle relief. Meanwhile Coach Tony DiCicco is
struggling to explain why she isn't always in the starting
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   This is what passes for controversy on a team that has scored 13
goals in three matches, while surrendering only 1. DiCicco sees no
need to fix something that does not appear to be broken. He prefers
to start Cindy Parlow, who, at 5 feet 11 inches, is the tallest
player on the team and who provides an inviting target for holding
the ball and dishing it to the slashing forwards, Mia Hamm and
Tiffeny Milbrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel Shannon is starter material,'' DiCicco said. ``I'm
looking for the combination that fits the best.''
</P>
<P>
   As the tournament enters the knockout phase, there is little
margin for error. MacMillan is faster than Parlow and plays a more
vibrant, cheeky game. She led the Americans with three goals in the
1996 Summer Olympics, including the most urgent goal in the history
of the women's national team, a shot in overtime that defeated
Norway by 1-0 in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the Olympic tournament, she knocked in the game
winner against Sweden. In the championship game against China,
MacMillan scored again. But the American formation has changed from
four midfielders to three, and so now MacMillan must sit and wait
her turn, preparing to heat up quickly when DiCicco signals for her
microwave offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role has changed,'' the 24-year-old MacMillan said. ``My
job is to be ready and take whatever time I get. I think I've shown
Tony that I'm ready to go. Ten minutes, 40, 90, I'll do anything he
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not a more improbable member on the World Cup roster
than MacMillan, who traveled soccer backroads instead of the
traditional upper-middle-class route from suburbia to the national
team. A native of Syosset, N.Y., MacMillan grew up in Escondido,
Calif., unable to afford the fees required to play in the Olympic
Development Program, a soccer fast lane for superior players.
Instead, she played high school and club soccer, which provided a
ticket out of her neighborhood the way basketball provides a ticket
out of some other neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only way I was going to get into college,''
MacMillan said. ``If I wanted to go to a good school, I needed a
full ride.''
</P>
<P>
   She played soccer constantly, at recess, during physical
education class, in the yard, at nearby fields. When there was no
goal, a pair of shoes would suffice as markers. ``My big tough-guy
brother would get upset when his friends would come over and ask
for me to play,'' MacMillan said with a laugh. ``When I was on the
soccer field, nothing else mattered. That was my time.''
</P>
<P>
   She received a scholarship from the University of Portland,
where MacMillan and Milbrett were known as the M &AMP; M line.
MacMillan became a four-time all-American and led the country in
scoring as a sophomore in 1993. As a senior, MacMillan led Portland
to the national championship game and was named national player of
the year. She attended a tryout camp for the 1996 Olympic team
after the season, but DiCicco left her name off the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was completely devastated,'' MacMillan said. Her college
eligibility had expired. There was no professional league to join.
``The national team was all that was left,'' she said. ``I wondered
if my career was over.''
</P>
<P>
   She returned to the University of Portland, where Coach Clive
Charles convinced her to keep training. Maybe she would get another
chance. The chance came later in 1995, when members of the national
team went on strike over a salary dispute. MacMillan was called
into camp and not only did she make the Olympic team, she became a
starter. ``I made a mistake with Shannon,'' DiCicco freely admits.
</P>
<P>
   The American formation changed after the Olympics and, with it,
so did MacMillan's role. Now she is the first forward off the
bench, relieving Hamm, spelling Milbrett, always threatening out of
the bullpen with her sledgehammer knuckleball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so good at bending the ball,'' MacMillan said. ``I'd
rather rip it and have them try to save it.'` &QL;

JIRI PELIKAN, 76; RAN STATE TV DURING `PRAGUE SPRING' IN '68 
(HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jiri Pelikan, a leader of communist Czechoslovakia's ``Prague
Spring,'' the short-lived period of liberal reforms in 1968, died
on Saturday in a hospital in Rome. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in Rome, having received political asylum in Italy
after the end of the Prague Spring when Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
forces invaded Czechoslovkia in August 1968.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Jitka, said he had been sick for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Pelikan, a warm, energetic man, was the head of Czechoslovakia's
government-run national television system.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a popular member of Parliament during the brief
period of liberalization, which Alexander Dubcek, the Communist
Party leader at the time, called socialism with a human face.
During that period, democratization was more extensive in
Czechoslovakia than in any other communist nation.
</P>
<P>
   During the thaw, Pelikan is said to have run the state
television system free of censorship, and he was active in other
spheres. He was a leading supporter of Dubcek.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the prime minister of France, Lionel Jospin, sent a
message to Pelikan's family lauding ``the memory of this
indefatigable protector of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Prague Spring ended, Pelikan lost his television job.
Harry Schwartz, an expert on Eastern Europe, wrote in a 1969 book
that Pelikan had been a victim ``of Moscow's fury at the media's
gigantic contribution to the nation's short period of unfettered
free speech.'' In addition, Pelikan's Czechoslovak citizenship was
revoked.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in 1923 in Moravia, a region in Czechoslovakia, and
was raised in a family of artists and thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   The late 1930s were eventful for his country and for him. In
1938, Moravia and an adjoining Czech region, Bohemia, jointly
became an autonomous unit within Czechoslovakia. In 1939, Nazi
Germany seized control of Czechoslovakia and designated Bohemia and
Moravia a German protectorate. Later that year, World War II began.
</P>
<P>
   Pelikan joined the Czech Communist Party in 1939, became active
in the anti-German resistance movement and was jailed for a time by
the Gestapo.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Czechoslovakia for Italy, he was a respected
leftist writer and intellectual there. He became an Italian citizen
and a Socialist member of the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the Czechoslovak Communist Party newspaper, Rude Pravo,
alleged that Pelikan had sent ``written materials and instructions
to Czechoslovakia inciting hostile individuals and groups to
antistate activities.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, he received a package in the mail that turned out to be
an explosive device. But, he said, he escaped injury when he
noticed smoke coming out of the half-opened package and threw it
into an adjoining room just before it burst into flames.

EDITORIAL: THE CLINTON LIBRARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 29: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every modern president, beginning with Herbert Hoover, has
established a separate library in his home state to house his
papers. These facilities are built with private money, and Bill
Clinton, who wants to see a $125 million library, museum and public
policy center in Little Rock, is already working on his. While
Clinton is not directly soliciting contributions, he seems to be
engaged in what might be called the softening-up process. During a
visit to New York City, he scheduled a private dinner Monday with
about 40 potential donors. News accounts suggested that Clinton
would share his plans for the library, and that the guests will
receive a follow-up call from the fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan, the only other recent chief executive to win
re-election, started this process even earlier in his second term.
But the danger of conflict of interest is obvious, and the library
foundations, as private nonprofit groups, can accept any amount of
money from anyone, including a foreign government.
</P>
<P>
   Constructing a presidential library is not an ordinary
charitable enterprise, as long as the president who is to be
honored is still in office. Congress should examine ways to limit
the size of donations, require full disclosure of contributors'
identities and bar money from foreign governments. A still better
approach might be to appropriate a set amount of money for each
president's outgoing library and leave it at that. Critics of the
current system even argue that presidential papers should be
gathered at a single site in Washington. They note that libraries
with such close ties to the families of their subjects can become
too protective, as many charged the Kennedy Library was during its
early years of operation.
</P>
<P>
   But some scholars defend the current system, arguing that a
large government institution devoted to all American presidents
would be unlikely to be as aggressive in collecting every possible
scrap of information about any given administration. ``If you want
a device to clean the bone as much as possible, the presidential
library does it pretty well,'' says Michael Beschloss, the
presidential historian.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton presidency may have picked its own bones clean
already. Subpoena-shy aides learned early on that anything written
down or tape recorded was potential evidence in some future legal
proceedings. But whatever documents do exist may therefore be
particularly critical, and a library that seeks them out would be a
valuable asset. However Clinton needs to be careful that he does
not wind up adding to the administration's already too-long list of
fund-raising scandals.

ELIZABETH DOLE CALLS FOR INTERNET DISCIPLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ Elizabeth Dole, whose run for the White House
is a disciplined, focused antithesis of her husband Bob's 1996
campaign, used a Bellevue visit Monday to call for discipline on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Dole asked Congress to pass legislation that would deny federal
money to any school or library that does not shut off access to
pornography among users of the Internet _ while also arguing that
the technology industry should be allowed to grow with ``as little
government intervention as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Libraries should not use federal money to put pornography on
their shelves, or their desktops or laptops,'' Dole said during an
appearance at the Bellevue Regional Library.
</P>
<P>
   Dole had a similar message when asked what measures she would
support to curb violence in schools. ``I think what we need is to
give teachers control of the classroom to restore discipline,'' she
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, and at a fund-raising breakfast in Seattle,
Dole declared herself a strong supporter of free trade and endorsed
China's bid for membership in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would make the entire Western Hemisphere a free trade
zone,'' Dole said. She said that President Clinton should press
Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate new trade
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Of China, Dole added, ``Twenty percent of the world's population
lives there. Exports are essential to the continued growth of our
own economy.''
</P>
<P>
   She was twice a cabinet secretary, and later president of the
American Red Cross, but Elizabeth Dole has long been known as the
skilled, always-upbeat supporting player behind Bob Dole's three
losing campaigns for the White House and his 1976 bid for the vice
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband was perhaps the moodiest, least manageable
presidential candidate in modern American history. He dropped
one-liners, lampooned his consultants and pollsters, joked about
``my program _ whatever it is,'' and at times turned a mean face to
adversity, in 1988 telling George Bush: ``Stop lying about my
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole has watched Texas Gov. George W. Bush, son of the
former president, dominate early fund-raising in the 2000 GOP race
and take a commanding lead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay focused. I'm not distracted,'' Elizabeth Dole said with
a smile yesterday, when asked to comment on the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Media commentators writing her off are ``the same pundits who
said (Bush's) father couldn't possibly lose the presidency'' after
the 1991 Gulf War victory,'' Dole added, still smiling. They were
the same pundits who, after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke,
``said that President Clinton would have to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Styling herself a ``courageous conservative,'' and saying she
intends to ``explain who I am,'' Dole has taken a series of blunt
stands in her campaign, and is the lone Republican presidential
contender to make an issue of gun safety. She initially raised the
issue at a dinner of conservative, pro-firearms New Hampshire
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe there is any reason for a family to have an
AK-47 to defend themselves,'' Dole said Monday, referring to the
Soviet-made assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   She also called for a ban on so-called cop killer bullets, and
child safety locks on all guns. ``I call it crime control, not gun
control,'' Dole said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   The audience at Bellevue Regional Library cheered Dole's call
for gun safety. She raised $50,000 at a Seattle breakfast, at which
her calls for free trade and China ties won an equally warm
reception.
</P>
<P>
   During a Seattle visit last week, Iowa's newly elected
Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack was asked about potential surprises in
his state's first-in-the-nation caucuses next February. ``Watch
Elizabeth Dole. She is getting big crowds everywhere,'' Vilsack
replied.
</P>
<P>
   But a Des Moines Register poll, released Monday, showed Bush
with a commanding lead of 40 percent to 13 percent over Dole among
the state's Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Dole said that she is drawing people ``never active in politics
before,'' as well as young people, into the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Before her library appearance, she made what is becoming a
mandatory pilgrimage for presidential candidates visiting
Washington. She traveled to the Microsoft campus in Redmond for a
meeting with company chairman Bill Gates and a talk with Microsoft
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Dole said she told Gates it was ``great'' that Microsoft had
developed software filters to keep pornography off childrens'
computer screens. She said she touted a proposal to make permanent
research and development tax credits, and her support for
legislation that would provide limited immunity for Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   A number of veteran GOP operatives watched Dole approvingly _
not as a potential threat to Bush, but as the Texas governor's
strongest possible running mate. In 1996, women voters preferred
Clinton over Bob Dole 54 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Al Gore could pack up and go home,'' said Republican
consultant Brett Bader.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush will show his wares to the Northwest early next
month, with a Portland appearance on July 7 and stops in Spokane
and Seattle on July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how her ``courageous conservatism'' differs from the
``compassionate conservatism'' touted by Bush, Dole laughed and
replied: ``I will let W. define his phrase.''

   American Home Products Corp., the current ne'er-do-well of the
pharmaceutical industry, is having a hard time selling its troubled
agricultural division, analysts said Monday, because two of the
most likely buyers _ Novartis AG and Astra Zeneca Group _ are also
trying to sell theirs.

   ``It's like a lot of houses suddenly becoming available in a
poor market,'' said David Saks, a managing director at Gruntal &AMP;
Co. ``I'm sure American Home will find a buyer. They just won't get
a peak price.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight out of agricultural products is an abrupt change for
the pharmaceutical industry. Not more than a year ago, many
pharmaceutical companies were trying to strengthen their
agricultural holdings during a downturn in pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, an agriculture division has become more hindrance
than help. Plagued by market troubles in Europe and Southeast Asia,
sales worldwide of agricultural products are projected to drop 3
percent or so this year, analysts said. The slip has prodded many
chief executives to jettison their divisions before the carnage
gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   Several directors at Novartis, Astra Zeneca and American Home
had also become concerned that the companies' continued presence in
agriculture might hurt their competitiveness in pharmaceuticals.
Analysts said that several board members had balked at allocating
additional research money to agricultural projects when the cash
could be used to develop new drugs, which would deliver much higher
profit margins than seeds and herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Monday how the sales of the agricultural
divisions _ three of the world's largest _ would take place.
Novartis, which is based in Switzerland, and Astra Zeneca of London
declined to comment on what each company called ``market
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for American Home, which is based in Madison, N.J.,
reiterated that the company was ``reviewing strategic
alternatives'' for its agricultural division. American Home had
first made such a statement earlier this month when the company
announced that the poor performance of its agricultural holdings
would reduce its earnings forecast for the second quarter by 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry's experience in agriculture may one
day become fodder for business textbooks. While agricultural
divisions did provide several advantages, like research synergies
with some pharmaceutical projects, the worldwide market for seeds
and herbicides was more turbulent than most pharmaceutical
executives had believed possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pharmaceutical companies learned an important lesson
here,'' said Alex Evans, a pharmaceutical analyst at Deutsche Bank
Securities in London. ``When things get messy in the agricultural
industry, they really get messy. The beautiful thing about
pharmaceuticals is that they are noncyclicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Many pharmaceutical executives who had an agricultural presence
had projected that sales of seeds and herbicides worldwide would
grow by 9 percent annually. These projections proved to be
shortsighted, when pharmaceutical executives did not see what
effects their products would have on the market.
</P>
<P>
   As more pharmaceutical companies raced to develop genetically
improved crops, many European consumers were becoming increasingly
concerned about crops with altered DNA. As a result, many European
governments are trying to limit their use, dampening what
executives had hoped would one day be a booming market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted, too, that pharmaceutical companies may have not
seen the cutthroat nature of the market. Monsanto developed a corn
seed that required less herbicide than any that had been developed.
When that seed became a popular seller, analysts said that its use
hurt the herbicide sales of Novartis and American Home.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the market for agricultural divisions has suddenly
become flooded, analysts noted that the properties on the block are
far from equal. Novartis replaced Wolfgang Samo as head of its
agricultural division last month with Heinz Imhof, his deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Imhof wasted no time in shaking up the division. He announced
last week that Novartis would cut 1,100 jobs from its worldwide
agricultural division _ some 6 percent of its 18,000 workers. Sales
in the Novartis agricultural division were off 8 percent in the
first quarter, but analysts have projected the unit to post a 5
percent gain for the year.
</P>
<P>
   During the last several weeks, there has been speculation in
European markets that Astra Zeneca and Novartis would spin their
agricultural businesses into one, which would easily be the world's
largest. Astra Zeneca's agricultural sales are expected to remain
flat this year at $2.9 billion, a respectable performance given the
industry decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, both companies have denied that it will happen,'' said
Paul Diggle, a pharmaceuticals analyst with SG Securities in
London. ``There could be buyers from the chemical companies. And
then they could spin them off. But I can tell you they will be
volatile stocks if that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have begun to ponder if American Home will find a
buyer. The company's agricultural products are not as sophisticated
as those of many of its competitors. If the company spins off its
agricultural division, analysts said Monday that it might fetch as
little as $2 billion. It had been valued at $5 billion just two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, whatever happens with the agricultural divisions of
Novartis, American Home and Astra Zeneca, many of their competitors
have reasons to gloat. Analysts noted Monday that agricultural
products may soon become just another one of the pharmaceutical
industry's sidelines _ like pharmacy benefit managers and medical
device companies _ that were bought with high hopes and then sold
because of low margins.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 29: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new era of government surpluses forecast last January has
suddenly grown bigger and brighter. Over the next 15 years,
President Clinton announced Monday, the federal government will
produce surpluses of $5.5 trillion, a cool $1 trillion higher than
January's number. The president also offered some ideas about how
to spend this windfall. In terms of broad intent, his proposals are
not much different from those he unveiled five months ago. But in
important details they are much improved. Clinton has also left the
door ajar for discussion of broader tax cuts down the road. That is
a political necessity, given Republican control of Congress, and
positions the president to argue for tax relief for low- and
middle-income families. But Clinton has no intention of cutting a
deal on taxes until Congress addresses his main priorities.
</P>
<P>
   His top priority, one that he hopes will become an important
part of his legacy, is to reduce the national debt and shore up
Social Security and Medicare. Fully 80 percent of the surplus would
be devoted to these purposes, with the rest divided equally between
discretionary-spending initiatives and a program to encourage
individual retirement accounts. The emphasis on Social Security and
Medicare is sensible and farsighted. If nothing is done, Social
Security will be threatened with insolvency as the baby boomers
retire. Medicare also requires substantial investments.
</P>
<P>
   One addition to the president's plans is a program to provide
improved prescription drug benefits for the elderly. The potential
of this program for cost escalation has to be studied closely. But
the most important change involves Social Security. In his earlier
proposal, Clinton wanted the flexibility, in the early years, to
spend Social Security surpluses on other programs _ much as those
funds are spent now. Responding to criticism from both Republicans
and Democrats, Clinton has now adopted the idea of a ``lock box''
to insure that excess revenues are used only to reduce the debt and
to insure Social Security's long-term health. In addition, the
interest saved by reducing the debt in future years would be
earmarked exclusively for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, Clinton's fire wall around the country's two biggest
entitlement programs is even stronger than before, which should
please his Republican critics. Of course nothing will fully satisfy
these Republicans unless he also gives some ground on their
proposals for high-end tax cuts. On this score, Clinton reiterated
his preference for targeted tax cuts for low- and moderate-income
families, while not ruling out discussions about something bigger.
</P>
<P>
   But he was tactically smart to insist on first things first.
Strengthen the entitlement programs, he said, then we can talk
about taxes and spending. That is the correct order. These rosy
predictions, after all, are only predictions. No one can be sure
what the economy will look like three years from now, let alone
fifteen. The reasonable approach is to capitalize on today's boom
to fix tomorrow's problems in Social Security and Medicare.

 &HT;    Ohio senate sends budget to Taft for passage
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Members of the Ohio legislature finished up
their budget-making chores Monday, giving overwhelming approval to
a two-year, $22.6 billion general operating budget and sending it
to Gov. Bob Taft.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 32-1 for the report of the conference committee
that worked out differences in separate budgets passed by the House
and Senate. The House vote was 83-12.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action followed House and Senate approval last week of
a separate $17 billion education budget, which Taft is scheduled to
sign today.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is expected to sign the operating budget _ after
reviewing it for possible line-item vetoes _ by Wednesday night,
said Scott Milburn, Taft's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Both budgets must be signed by Thursday, the start of the
state's new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The operating budget included more than $20 million in high
technology assistance for the Miami Valley, including $4 million
for the National Composite Center in Kettering. The $4 million was
inserted by the conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel J. Curtis, vice president of the Miami Valley Economic
Development Coalition, praised the area's legislators, particularly
Sen. Charles Horn, R-Centerville, for pushing to get the money for
the composite center and other high-tech projects.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be used to start building 100 bridges throughout
Ohio using composite materials to give bridges longer life than
concrete and steel, said Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also included $7 million for the Ohio Research
Collaboration, to promote cooperation in graduate studies between
the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base and four Ohio universities, including Wright State University
and the University of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Additional money in the budget will pay for high-tech training
for Miami Valley toolmakers and machinists.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of the operating budget went to human
services, including expanding Medicaid health insurance to the
working poor and providing support to grandparents and other family
members other than mothers and fathers raising children.
</P>
<P>
   Although the budget is supposed to focus on spending, it
included a controversial provision to exempt the records of the
law-writing Legislative Service Commission from Ohio's public
records law. This provision was opposed by the Ohio Newspaper
Association but lawmakers said they want to keep the early stages
of bill writing confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Hartley, D-Springfield, said this provision alone
caused him to oppose the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to do a whole lot of mischief with this
provision,'' said Hartley.
</P>
<P>
   The levels of spending in the education and general operating
budget will leave enough money to provide a 3 percent personal
income tax cut next year, compared to a cut of about 9 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A family of four with an income of $40,000 that received a tax
cut of about $120 this year would get a $40 tax cut next year, said
Rep. J. Donald Mottley, R-West Carrollton, who voted for the
operating budget.

GRAND PRIX, GOLD LIONS, CYBER LIONS, BEST OF SHOW AND GOOD EGGS:
YES, IT'S AWARDS SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (af) 
By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The advertising awards season is winding down, with
annual honors being given for creative achievement and corporate
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   British agencies won the two top honors last week in the
competition at the 46th International Advertising Festival in
Cannes, France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Litany,'' a thoughtful spot for The Independent, the British
newspaper, took the Grand Prix in the competition for television
and cinema work. The commercial, created last year for showing in
movie theaters, was from Lowe Howard-Spink in London, part of the
Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Litany,'' which was shot in black and white, an announcer
admonishes viewers against a long list of life experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't walk, don't walk at night, don't walk on the right,''
the announcer intones, then goes on to proclaim sentiments like
``Don't be fat, don't be thin,'' ``Don't be childish, don't be
old'' and ``Don't be ordinary, don't be different.'' The spot ends
with a bundle of newspapers, The Independent's logo visible on the
top, falling as if thrown from a delivery truck and the announcer
declaring, ``Don't buy, don't read.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to convey that readers of The Independent are,
well, independent. Bob Garfield, ad critic for the trade
publication Advertising Age, praised the commercial as ``a
mesmerizing warning against warnings, a broadside against the
forces of reaction and repression.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 22 Gold Lion awards presented for commercials, United
States agencies won 6. Two shops won two each: Cliff Freeman &AMP;
Partners in New York, part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC, for Hollywood
Video and Outpost.com, and Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., for
Nike.
</P>
<P>
   DDB Chicago, part of the DDB Worldwide Communications Group unit
of Omnicom Group, won a Gold Lion for two spots for Budweiser beer.
J. Walter Thompson New York, part of the J. Walter Thompson Co.
unit of WPP Group PLC, won a Gold for a spot for Kellogg's Raisin
Bran Crunch cereal.
</P>
<P>
   In the print, or press and poster, part of the Cannes
competition, TBWA Simons Palmer GGT in London, part of the TBWA
Worldwide unit of Omnicom, won the Grand Prix for a print ad for
Sony Playstation that shows a boy and a girl with video game
controls protruding from their chests. United States shops won none
of the 15 Gold Lions presented for print and none of the 17 Lions
in the media competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cyber Lions interactive competition, United States
agencies won five of the eight Gold Lions; Ogilvy Interactive in
New York, part of the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of WPP, won
three, including a Grand Prix, for work for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The young creatives competition at Cannes was devoted to
producing ads for the American Foundation for AIDS Research. A team
from Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis, Dawn McCarthy and Xenia
Rutherford, won a silver medal in the print category.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Festivals named six grand Best of Show winners for
its 42d annual international print and radio competition.
</P>
<P>
   BBDO Chile in Santiago, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of
Omnicom, won for best magazine campaign, for an ad for Swatch.
Publicis-Norton in Sao Paulo, Brazil, part of Publicis SA, won for
best poster, for work for Rowenta appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi office in Sydney, Australia, won for best
newspaper ad, for work for No Frills Funerals and Cremations.
FCB/Tapsa in Madrid, part of the Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding Worldwide
unit of True North Communications, won for the best public service
campaign, for an organization devoted to fighting child labor.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Communications in Boston, part of Snyder Communications,
won best design, for a promotional booklet for Volkswagen of
America. And JvM Werbeagentur GmbH in Hamburg, Germany, won the
grand award for radio commercials, for a spot for Noah Menshcen
fuer Tiere EV, an animal rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, Advertising New York, the annual benefit event sponsored
by the Advertising Club of New York, Advertising Women of New York
and the American Advertising Federation, named three recipients of
the 1999 Good Egg Awards to honor corporate citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Warwick Baker O'Neill won in the agency category, the Fuji Bank
and Trust Co. unit of Fuji Bank Ltd. in the advertiser category and
WNBC-TV, part of the NBC unit of the General Electric Co., in the
media category.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Vehicles Inc., which helps the poor develop
marketable work skills, won the Jack Avrett Award, which is named
for the event's founder and recognizes work by a nonprofit
educational organization.

BIG FRENCH WATER COMPANY TO ACQUIRE NALCO CHEMICAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a deal that will create the world's largest water treatment
company, Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux SA of France will acquire the
Nalco Chemical Co. for $4.1 billion in cash, or $53 a share. Suez
will also assume about $400 million in Nalco debt.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have known that some sort of deal was imminent since
Thursday, when Nalco said it was exploring a ``business
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question was never if Nalco would do a deal, just with
whom,'' said Timothy J. Gerdeman, an analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the deal's size surprised Wall Street. Until last week,
Nalco's shares had rarely approached $40 this decade. They closed
at $42.50 on Friday. Monday, investors corrected their low-ball
estimates, driving Nalco shares up $9, to $51.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nalco shareholders should be going out for martinis,
celebrating the largesse of Suez Lyonnaise,'' said David Manlowe,
an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Mestrallet, Suez's chief executive, insists he is pouring
celebratory libations, too. Suez is powerful in municipal water
treatment and energy systems, but it has been a laggard in the
industrial market, particularly in the United States. By adding
Nalco, he said, Suez can sell water treatment, energy and other
services that corporations increasingly outsource, or contract out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can use Nalco's client base to establish ourselves as an
outsourcing partner in the United States,'' he said. ``And later,
we can transfer what we've learned to Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which was reported in The Wall Street Journal, comes
at a time of rapid change among water treatment companies. The
industries they serve _ steel, paper and the like _ have been
consolidating, yielding much larger customers with formidable
purchasing power, and with a zeal for farming out the management of
their entire water systems, from intake to disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all dealing with larger customers and larger
competitors, and we're being asked to provide a much broader array
of programs and services,'' said Edward J. Mooney, the chairman of
Nalco.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years Hercules has bought Betz Dearborn,
Ciba Specialty Chemicals bought Allied Colloids of Britain, and
Vivendi S.A., Suez Lyonnaise's main rival in France, bought U.S.
Filter. Two weeks ago Suez itself said it would buy the Calgon
Corporation, a Pittsburgh water company.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as they bought Calgon, it made sense they'd want even
greater critical mass,'' said Christopher Bodnar, an analyst with
Bear, Stearns &AMP; Company.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts had speculated that Ciba or Ashland Inc., which
has a small water subsidiary, might go after Nalco, or that Nalco
might turn acquirer and buy Cytec, a smaller company. In fact,
Cytec's stock moved up $3.1875 after the Nalco deal was announced,
and analysts said it was because Cytec was one of the few potential
acquisition targets left.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Nalco acquisition will not add to Suez's earnings
until the second year, the companies say they have already spotted
$100 million in potential synergies, including cutting costs,
increasing sales by selling full-service packages and and combining
purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   Job cuts will certainly be part of the equation, but the ax is
not likely to hit hard in Naperville, Ill., Nalco's headquarters.
Suez plans to combine the operations of Nalco, Calgon and Aquazur,
its internal water treatment company, into a $3 billion company
that will operate under the Nalco Chemical name, and be based in
Naperville. Mooney will be the new company's chief executive.

 &HT;    Tech company laying off workers
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Computer Sciences Corp.'s Austin-based Financial
Services Group laid off 122 workers nationwide Monday, as the
company cut back because of a short-term slump caused by year
2000-related concerns.
</P>
<P>
   CSC's financial industry customers, many of them large insurance
companies, have cutback spending on computer software, said CSC
spokesman Howard Falkenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Y2K problem,'' Falkenberg said. ``Customers are slowing
down their investment in new systems or in modification of their
existing systems. As a consequence, the Financial Services Group is
a little overstaffed. They are having to make an adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   The downturn doesn't affect the rest of El Segundo, Calif,-based
CSC, which has major business operations that serve European
corporations and the U.S. government. And the Financial Services
Group doesn't expect to make any further Y2K workforce reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The much-publicized year 2000 computer problem may create
problems for companies that sell complex software systems to
corporate clients, one analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies that are buying software are playing it very
safe,'' said analyst John Dunkle with Workgroup Strategic Services
of Portsmouth, N.H. ``They are not canceling orders. They are
deferring purchases. They already have their Y2K fix in place, but
they don't know how badly the patient is going to be bleeding until
the calendar changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are Y2K problems that occur, some companies will be
spending millions of dollars (on software fixes) in a matter of
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Other business operations plan to interview laid-off workers
this week for possible rehire elsewhere within the company. Workers
will receive outplacement assistance and severance payments
according to their seniority.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs, which take effect July 9, affect a broad range of
jobs, including computer programmers. Many of those laid off were
recently hired.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term Y2K-related slump won't affect the company's
expansion plans in downtown Austin, Falkenberg said. CSC expects to
build three buildings totaling 700,000 square feet downtown. It
expects to start work on the first two buildings early next year.
Those buildings should be occupied by mid-2001. The company is
expanding downtown because it expects its Austin work force will
grow from 1,300 workers to 3,500 workers during the next several
years.
</P>
<P>
   CSC is one of the largest software companies in the world, with
50,000 workers and more than $7.6 billion in revenue for the fiscal
year completed in March. The company's Financial Services Group
employs 3,000 people worldwide.

   As NATO peacekeepers struggle to quell ethnic violence in
Kosovo, the West is considering the larger job of reconstruction in
the Balkans. The initial impulse to limit aid to Serbia while
Slobodan Milosevic remains in power is right. Some humanitarian
assistance is justified, but no money should go to Milosevic or his
government.
</P>
<P>
   The West has agreed to raise money for the rebuilding of Kosovo
and Montenegro and economic development aid for Macedonia, Albania
and other neighboring countries that suffered because of the war.
The idea is to help them recover and tie the region more closely to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While few Serbians showed interest in the atrocities their
countrymen were committing in Serbia, they do not deserve to freeze
this winter because of it. Democracy will be furthered in Serbia if
people get over their fury with the West and realize that it is
their leader, not ordinary Serbs, who is the target of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever possible, humanitarian aid should go to Serbia through
independent groups, such as nongovernment organizations, opposition
political leaders who run cities like Nis and Cacak and the
Orthodox Church, which recently called for Milosevic to step down.
Serbia has a temporary shortage of commodities that can most easily
bypass the government _ food and medicine. But the long-term threat
is a winter of rolling electricity blackouts, which will cut heat
and water for many. The country's electric power system should be
rebuilt, but through the work of foreign companies or those owned
by the opposition in Serbia. The West should support democracy in
Serbia by helping groups like the independent media and opposition
mayors, perhaps even helping them rebuild factories or
infrastructure in their cities.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult reconstruction issues is what to do
about roads and bridges needed by Serbia's neighbors. Bulgaria, for
example, depends on Serbia's portion of the Danube river _
currently blocked by bombed-out bridges _ for shipping. The river
should be cleared of debris so commerce can resume, but the West
ought not to rebuild the bridges.
</P>
<P>
   If the reconstruction of Bosnia is prologue, then money will
surely fall short of what Kosovo, Montenegro, their Balkan
neighbors and democratic groups in Serbia need. Serbia's most basic
need is not economic help, but democracy, which is best furthered
if Milosevic is denied Western aid. &QL;

TROUBLED MEXICAN STEELMAKER TALKS OF MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICK WILLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's largest steel manufacturer, which
defaulted on $1.9 billion of debt two months ago, announced Monday
that it was discussing a proposed merger with one of the country's
largest industrial conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Altos Hornos de Mexico and executives from the prospective
buyer, Industrias Monterrey SA, filed a letter of intent with the
Mexican stock exchange Monday. Under the plan, Altos Hornos will
negotiate with no other companies for 90 days. Industrias Monterrey
said it would own a controlling stake in Altos Hornos if the talks
led to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Santiago Clariond, the president of Industrias Monterrey's
steel division, said in an interview Monday that his company would
not invest in Altos Hornos unless the steelmaker's debt was
reorganized. Neither company explained how this would be
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be impossible for us to merge with Altos Hornos with
the debt they now have,'' Clariond said.
</P>
<P>
   Altos Hornos has been dragged down by onerous debts that now
total about $2.4 billion. Trading of shares for the company, which
had temporary court protection against creditors, was suspended in
New York and Mexico City on May 26.
</P>
<P>
   To many industry analysts, the announcement Monday said little
about how Altos Hornos could be rescued financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know nothing more today about how they will manage their
debt than we did on the day they defaulted,'' said Rodrigo Marin, a
steel industry analyst at the Inverlat brokerage in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Still pending is the seizure of 17.5 percent of Altos Hornos
shares by Banco Nacional de Mexico just before the steel company
announced default in late May.
</P>
<P>
   The company's other large creditors include Chase Manhattan Bank
and Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said they expected Industrias Monterrey would
agree to take on the bulk of Altos Hornos' debt in exchange for
majority control of the company.
</P>
<P>
   A government-run company that was privatized in 1991, Altos
Hornos was hit hard by last year's sharp drop in steel prices as
cheap Russian and Asian steel flooded world markets. But some
analysts blame Altos Hornos management for the company's decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management of the company was extravagant and created a potent
cocktail of too much debt and voluble steel prices,'' said Damian
Fraser, head of Mexico research at Warburg Dillon Read.

SELLING SAINT LAURENT TO DAUGHTERS WHO LUNCH

 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I'm usually in New York for five hours,'' Alber
Elbaz was saying last week in the middle of a whirlwind of public
appearances and private dinners to promote him as the designer of
Yves Saint Laurent ready-to-wear. ``I get here, and I'm right back
on a plane. And I get jet lag going from New York to New Jersey!''
</P>
<P>
   He was relaxing at Il Cantinori with a small group of store and
magazine people when, sometime between the antipasto and the pasta,
he remarked on how personally he took everything written about his
collections and how he had been hurt by some criticism of his first
Saint Laurent show last March. Joan Kaner, the fashion director of
Neiman Marcus, tried to console him by saying he had been in a
no-win situation because whatever he did, somebody would find
fault. If he had made drastic changes, she told him, some people
would be unhappy, and if he didn't, others would be unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're damned if you do and damned if you don't,'' she said,
``so don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right, of course, but a designer's career is put on the
line with every collection. And it's a heavy burden for a young
designer to be given the responsibility of carrying on the
tradition of a venerable house. Of course, Saint Laurent was only
21 when he took over at Christian Dior after the master's death,
and Elbaz is now 37 and has years of experience. But this is a
highly competitive era, and Saint Laurent is still alive and
involved in designing the couture.
</P>
<P>
   Elbaz may have won praise for his previous work at Guy Laroche,
but his successor, Ronald Van der Kemp, lost his job after showing
just one collection. So Elbaz is walking a tightrope without a net,
attempting to breathe new life into a 40-year-old house that has
just been bought by Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, which plans to sell
it to Gucci, which it also controls. That has to worry the new
designer on the block, especially a thin-skinned one like Elbaz,
who, in a low-key way, always seems anxious to please.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why he was in this country for a week to show a
sampling of the fall clothes to potential customers, to introduce
the cruise 2000 collection to the industry and, not so
incidentally, to make nice with retailers and members of the press.
</P>
<P>
   The balancing act for Elbaz is to make Yves Saint Laurent
relevant to younger women who associate the label with their
mothers _ and at the same time not turn off those older,
tried-and-true customers. He is trying to do that by showing
classic Saint Laurent styles like pinstriped pants suits,
bubble-shaped tops and trench coats, changing them enough so that a
potential customer will look at them in a new way. He has taken the
bubble tops, for example, that Saint Laurent makes in evening
fabrics like taffeta and transformed them into day wear by whipping
them up in raincoat fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Elbaz's whirlwind tour began when he boarded the Concorde in
Paris on June 17, arriving in Washington for a three-day stay that
included a black-tie dinner that night for 120 high-profile guests
like Vernon Jordan and Deeda Blair. It was held at the Potomac,
Md., home of Ernest and Sally Marx, the owners of the Saks Jandel
stores in the Washington area, with two Saint Laurent boutiques.
The next day there was a presentation of the fall collection for 50
top customers.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on to New York for model fittings and working with
Saks Fifth Avenue's visual staff on displays for the store windows,
before a Monday dinner given by Roberta Myers, the editor in chief
of Mirabella, and Michelle Morgan, the magazine's fashion director.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's agenda included a 9 a.m. meeting with Saks employees
to familiarize them with the clothes, a fashion show and cocktail
party that evening at Saks, and a dinner that went on until well
past midnight at the trendy Bond Street restaurant, where the hosts
were Princess Yasmin Aga Khan and Philip Miller, the chairman of
Saks.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday began at 7 a.m. with more model fittings and another
showing of fall clothes at the Saint Laurent Rive Gauche boutique
on Madison Avenue, capped by a lunch in the store for members of
New York's young social set.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Saltzman, fashion director of Vanity Fair, had invited
friends like Marina Rust, Liz Cohen and Samantha Phipps and the
actresses Patricia Arquette and Chloe Sevigny to meet Elbaz and see
the Saint Laurent clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Alber,'' Ms. Saltzman said, ``and I grew up loving
Saint Laurent and wanting to wear Saint Laurent. Alber is giving me
that chance. I'm crazy about him. So I put together 50 young women
who wouldn't think of coming here to shop. They're the next
generation of people thinking about designer clothes, and I'm
hoping this becomes more like clothes we can wear.''
</P>
<P>
   She had advised Donna Faircloth, the Rive Gauche
public-relations director, to keep the lunch menu simple and have
plates on the table when the guests sat down so people could get
out fast. Ms. Faircloth took her at her word. Lunch turned out to
be a timbale of fresh vegetables and fruit, served with thin slices
of French bread, followed by melon-ball-size scoops of sorbet and
petits fours iced with the orange and pink Rive Gauche logo. Elbaz,
for one, was still hungry; he said he hoped he would have time for
a hamburger before going on to fit the cruise wear.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His sentiment was echoed by Ms. Sevigny, who was seated next to
him, but it didn't dampen her admiration for the collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the clothes, especially the day clothes,'' she said.
``I did a shoot for Harper's Bazaar a month ago in all Yves Saint
Laurent clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Venerable fashion houses, like cosmetic companies, automakers
and television networks, are all working feverishly to attract a
new generation. The trick, though, is to do that without losing
their loyal customers. Hence, the presence of longtime customers of
the couture house like Princess Yasmin and Nan Kempner, who sat
next to Elbaz at the Bond Street dinner (``He's adorable,'' she
said) and who popped into the Rive Gauche boutique Thursday while
Nancy Reagan was there with her Secret Service escort.
</P>
<P>
   Another longtime fan, Sandy Hill, was at Wednesday's lunch.
``Saint Laurent was the first designer I was aware of and wanted to
buy when I was new to New York,'' she recalled. ``I found a tuxedo
dress on sale and said to myself, `I'll wear this forever.'''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to say she liked what Elbaz had done in his first
collection for the house. ``He resisted making a radical break,''
she said. ``He honored someone who is arguably the greatest
designer of his time. He made it modern yet unmistakably Saint
Laurent.''
</P>
<P>
   Elbaz said repeatedly during his round of appearances here that
he had tried to represent Saint Laurent and not himself in the
first collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about me _ it's about him,'' he told the guests in
the Madison Avenue boutique, seated on a low platform before the
show started, as he answered questions posed by Ms. Saltzman. ``For
every designer, Saint Laurent is not just the name of a designer or
of a house. It's a dream. A lot of people were expecting me to
change, but it was more about going back to the archives. Then I
did it my way with a different cut and different proportions. I cut
off the evening dresses and made them shirts and showed them with
pants, always with pants.''
</P>
<P>
   But he kept the pagoda shoulders on the tailored suits.
``Without them, it's not a Saint Laurent suit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Fischelis, fashion director of Saks, checked out the
stock that arrived at her store last week and said that while the
cut was streamlined, it would still please longtime customers.
</P>
<P>
   Elbaz's last appearance was on Thursday at the press showing of
40 pieces out of 400 that make up the cruise collection. The
tailored pants suits, shirtdresses and raincoats still bore the
Saint Laurent stamp very strongly. Elbaz has said that he believes
in evolution, not revolution, which has been the house's credo for
the last 20 years or so. That has also been the main criticism of
those who believe fashion should always be moving ahead and is no
doubt one of the reasons Pierre Berge, Saint Laurent's longtime
business partner, brought in a new designer. And why that designer
was acting last week much like a movie star promoting his latest
film. But it will be a while before the box-office results are in
on this one.

 (EDS: Subs 1st and 3d grafs to clarify sourcing) HUBBELL AND STARR(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, has
reached a tentative plea agreement with Webster Hubbell, lawyers
familiar with the case said Monday, in which Hubbell will plead
guilty to a felony charge of lying about the role he and Hillary
Rodham Clinton played in a questionable Arkansas land deal.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement should avert a trial scheduled for August
that was likely to have explored Mrs. Clinton's conduct as a lawyer
in the land deal, which federal regulators characterized as a sham
and which led to the collapse of a savings and loan institution.
Mrs. Clinton might even have been called as a witness in the trial,
which would have taken place at the same time she is expected to
begin her campaign for the U.S. Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although he will plead guilty to the felony charge as well as to
a misdemeanor charge in a separate tax evasion case, Hubbell is not
expected to cooperate with Starr in providing additional
information about either President Clinton or Mrs. Clinton, the
lawyers said. Nonetheless, the lawyers said that Starr will not
seek any additional jail time for Hubbell, who was released from
prison two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Hubbell is sentenced to jail depends on the judge in the
fraud and tax cases, U.S. District Court Judge James Robertson, who
will also decide whether to accept the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The two Hubbell cases were the last to be brought by Starr. The
last two cases prosecuted by his office, against Susan McDougal and
Julie Hiatt Steele, ended in hung juries. The Hubbell plea
agreement means that the independent counsel is effectively close
to the end of his five-year investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching the agreement, it appears Starr has finally relented
in his efforts to press Hubbell to produce information damaging to
the Clintons. One associate of Starr, not in the prosecutor's
office, said he believed the decision to dispose of the Hubbell
cases reflected Starr's eagerness to be done with the long and
difficult investigation of the Clintons and to close down the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Although his office is still investigating a few matters
involving the Clintons, the major task remaining is for Starr to
issue a report about his activities. Some of Starr's associates
have said that he is tentatively planning to issue a report that
could be highly critical of the Clintons' behavior, especially that
of Mrs. Clinton. Under the independent counsel law, Starr is
required to issue a report on his activities to the three-judge
panel that appointed him. But it is unclear under a 1994 amendment
as to how much he is allowed to criticize people who have not been
indicted, like the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's years-long pursuit of Hubbell, whom he had indicted
three times, had become for critics of Starr and the independent
counsel statute a prime example of prosecutorial over-reach.
Starr's supporters have said Hubbell was pursued so vigorously
because his case was an example of stonewalling by the Clintons'
associates.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law, enacted in the aftermath of
Watergate, expires at midnight Wednesday. Although Congress held
many hearings, there was in the end no interest in extending the
statute. Starr is not obliged to close down his office because of
the law's demise.
</P>
<P>
   But he has testified before Congress that he believes the law,
which was supposed to insulate high-profile prosecutions from
politics, has not worked because independent prosecutors invariably
are accused of being political by associates of the subjects of the
investigations. As a result, he too believed the law should lapse,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, a former chief justice of the state of Arkansas and
once the No. 3 official in the Clinton justice department, spent
nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges brought
by the independent counsel that he bilked his partners in the Rose
law firm of Little Rock, where he had once worked with Mrs.
Clinton. He is currently a research analyst at the National Center
on Institutions and Alternatives, a non-profit study group in
Alexandria, Va. He has been working on criminal justice issues,
according to a statement from the organization and in his recent
book, he said he was paid about $12,000 a year. As a convicted
felon, he can no longer practice law.
</P>
<P>
   The felony charge to which he is expected to plead guilty does
not involve the Whitewater land development but a lesser-known but
more complicated land deal in Arkansas known as Castle Grande.
Castle Grande was funded by Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan,
which was owned at the time by James B. and Susan McDougal, the
Clintons' partners in Whitewater. Federal regulators attributed
Madison Guaranty's eventual failure in part to its involvement in
the Castle Grande development.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Hubbell did not mention Mrs. Clinton by name
but refers more than 30 times to the ``1985-86 billing partner'' on
the Madison Guaranty account, a description of Mrs. Clinton's role
in the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Hubbell's concealment of the role
he and Mrs. Clinton played in the Castle Grande development
defrauded the federal government in two ways. Had the Rose law firm
disclosed its activities to federal regulators, the law firm would
probably have been prohibited from lucrative legal contracts with
the same federal agencies. Under the employment contract, the firm
was obliged to disclose what appeared to be a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Starr had charged, the concealment interfered with
the ability of the regulators to understand just how troubled an
institution Madison Guaranty was, delaying its shutdown, and
increasing the eventual cost to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had for a time denied any involvement. But when
long-missing billing records from the law firm were discovered in
the White House book room in January 1996, two years after they
were subpoenaed by Starr, Mrs. Clinton said she remembered having
done legal work on the development but knew it by a different name.
</P>
<P>
   The tax fraud indictment had accused Hubbell, his wife, Suzanna,
his accountant and lawyer of scheming in the last four years to
avoid paying taxes and penalties of more than $850,000. Under the
proposed plea agreement, all charges will be dropped against Mrs.
Hubbell and the two family advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had contended that much of the owed taxes stemmed
from money Hubbell had embezzled and from hundreds of thousands of
dollars in income from jobs referred to him by friends and
supporters of the president. The indictment said Hubbell did little
work for those jobs and suggested that they might have been
arranged to discourage him from cooperating with investigators.

FIDELITY AND LEHMAN IN DEAL ON BROAD RANGE OF SERVICES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (nk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, the giant retail-oriented investment
group, and Lehman Brothers, the old-line Wall Street house that
caters to institutions, announced a broad alliance Monday involving
an array of products, distribution channels and research.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which will be phased in over six to eight
weeks, the 6.5 million customers of Fidelity's brokerage unit _ 2.7
million of them online _ will get access to a wide range of Lehman
research and underwritings of stocks and bonds. The biggest and
most active of these customers will be eligible for allotments of
initial public offerings, which have been particularly coveted
recently because many issues have jumped spectacularly in price.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman will get a big retail outlet for its stock and bond
underwritings and research and greater marketing capability,
particularly in Fidelity's Internet clients. That is expected to
help it win new underwriting business, a traditional strength.
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not disclosed, but officials said no money would
change hands between the publicly held Lehman, the fourth-biggest
brokerage house, and Fidelity, whose $819.8 billion of assets make
it the world's biggest money manager. Fidelity, based in Boston, is
a unit of the FMR Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Holders of Fidelity's 280 mutual funds will be largely
unaffected unless they also have Fidelity brokerage accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expressed approval of the strategies reflected in the
deal, which may have contributed to a gain in the shares of Lehman,
which rose $3.6875, to $57.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lehman needs to find ways to more extensively broaden the
distribution base for their products,'' said Judah Kraushaar, a
financial services analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``Fidelity
increasingly has to find ways to broaden their product reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraushaar said the joint effort, rather than a merger, would
allow the companies to continue to focus on what they know best.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Eberling, senior analyst at Putnam, Lovell de Guardiola &AMP;
Thornton, agreed, calling the alliance ``a very smart strategic
move,'' one that recognizes the growing importance of the Internet
as a distribution channel and helps keep rivals for stock and bond
underwritings at bay. ``The ability to defuse the pitch against
them is critical,'' Eberling said.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's link with Lehman replaces a narrower one formed two
years ago with Salomon Brothers, which ended with Salomon Smith
Barney's absorption into Citigroup. That effort put much of its
focus on initial offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new relationship, participation in initial and other
stock offerings will be confined to brokerage customers with at
least $500,000 in assets with the fund manager, members of Fidelity
Premium Services or customers qualifying for Active Trader or Gold
Circle reduced-commission status. A spokeswoman declined to give
the number of such clients. &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 29: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gay politics today are dominated by men and women in business
clothes, representing buttoned-down organizations like the Human
Rights Campaign, Log Cabin Republicans and the Lambda Legal Defense
and Education Fund. But the movement that looks so mainstream in
1999 was born at a bar in Greenwich Village 30 years ago this
summer. When police harassed gay patrons of the Stonewall Inn in
June of 1969, the patrons stood their ground and touched off three
nights of fierce civil disobedience _ prominently featuring men in
drag. Within a year, the name ``Stonewall'' had become synonymous
with the struggle for gay civil rights and full protection under
the law.
</P>
<P>
   The building that once housed the Stonewall Inn on Christopher
Street has earned a listing in the National Register of Historic
Places, becoming the first site in the country to recognize the
contributions that gay and lesbian Americans have made to the
national culture. This also marks the gay rights movement's
evolution from a fringe activity to a well-organized effort with
establishment affiliations and substantial political clout.
</P>
<P>
   The Gay and Lesbian Pride March held over the weekend captured
the transformation. At the end of the 1960s, few political and
civic leaders participated in the event. But over the weekend, the
marchers included Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Fire Commissioner
Thomas Von Essen, as well as firefighters and police officers.
Things have come a long way since those stormy summer nights in
1969.

FORMER N.J. FINANCIER TO SETTLE STATE CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Brennan, the former New Jersey financier whose prominent
philanthropy and love of horse racing turned out to have been
financed by stock fraud, has agreed to a $100 million settlement of
state charges, prosecutors said Monday. The settlement would also
bar Brennan from any involvement with the securities business in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was first announced in state Superior Court in
Newark, N.J., on Friday, but the terms were not disclosed until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement may mostly be a paper victory for New Jersey and
the investors it represented. The main benefit may be to save the
state and Brennan the expense of a trial, which was about to begin
in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 55 and retired in Juno Beach, Fla., filed for
bankruptcy in 1995. Soon before, a federal judge in New York issued
a $71.5 million judgment against Brennan and First Jersey
Securities, a brokerage firm he founded, for violating federal
securities laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission also banned
Brennan from the securities business.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy officials have been seeking to recover cash Brennan
was suspected of moving offshore as his empire crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, $55 million would come from a
settlement that Brennan's bankruptcy trustee negotiated with
investors last year as part of the liquidation of estate assets
still in this country. Brennan is liable for the other $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even if all of the money could be collected, it would be a
fraction of the $1.2 billion in compensation and fines the state
sought when it filed the suit four years ago. The state charged
that after Brennan cut back First Jersey's activities under
pressure from the authorities, he swindled investors out of $300
million from 1988 to 1995 using high-pressure sales tactics and
price manipulation of penny stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that Brennan and six others used two brokerage
firms that Brennan secretly controlled, Hibbard Brown and L.C.
Wegard &AMP; Co., to carry out their maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan has an unlisted phone number, and a message left with
his lawyer, Gerald Gline, was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan became nationally known in the 1980s for television
commercials in which he stepped from a helicopter and urged
investors to ``come grow with us.'' By then, the SEC had already
begun its investigation into stock manipulation. One SEC official
called him the ``Johnny Appleseed of penny stock fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Brennan, who lived in Monmouth County, N.J.,
strongly maintained his innocence and was a major figure in the
thoroughbred horse racing industry in New Jersey. He gave millions
of dollars to Seton Hall University, his alma mater, and other
charities. He also financed an advertising campaign for gun
control.

LOOKING FOR MONEY AND A HOME, THE CLINTONS PAY A VISIT
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Ill., Conn., Ark.)   (jw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton came here Monday to raise more than
$1 million for Democratic candidates running for Congress next
year. But one of the better-known of those potential Democratic
candidates _ Hillary Rodham Clinton _ skipped the event, spending
the day looking for houses in New York City and Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States,''
the announcer said as Clinton took his eighth-row aisle seat,
unexpectedly alone, at a special afternoon performance of ``The
Iceman Cometh.'' For the next five hours, the president joined a
not-quite-full house of donors who had paid $1,000 a head to watch
the harrowing production of the Eugene O'Neill play about a group
of down-and-outers at Harry's Bar on New York's West Side.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton took in the drama, Mrs. Clinton and their daughter,
Chelsea, for the first time began viewing houses where the they
might move in anticipation of Mrs. Clinton's likely run for the
U.S. Senate. Her spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said that the process
took longer than was expected; hence, she missed the play and
showed up on Monday night at a fund-raising dinner after the play.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said that Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea had spent the day
looking at houses and apartments in ``New York City and its
environs.'' She declined to offer any details, though another
associate of Mrs. Clinton said that the main focus of her attention
continued to be Westchester County and that she had viewed
videotapes of a house in North Salem that had caught her eye.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the play, Clinton joined the audience in giving
the cast, including Kevin Spacey, who plays the lead, a standing
ovation. Clinton then took the stage, shaking hands with the entire
ensemble and repeatedly embracing Spacey, who suggested the
fund-raiser for the Democratic Senate and Congressional Campaign
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his remarks, made no mention of his wife's absence
or her political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as Spacey stood to his side, the president took note of
the human struggles and frailties presented in the O'Neill play,
and linked them both to his own politics and to the 30th
anniversary of the modern gay rights movement, that was marked in
New York City over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons that I became and stayed a Democrat is that
I always felt that our party was more interested in people in their
individual struggles, and we always thought everyone should have a
chance,'' Clinton said. By way of example, Clinton discussed the
uprising at the former Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich
Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 30 years ago today not very far from here that the
Stonewall riots occurred, which sparked the gay and lesbian civil
rights movement,'' Clinton said. ``I'm proud of the fact that the
Democratic Party has been clearly and unambiguously for the
elimination of all forms of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in New York on the same day that the New Yorker
magazine reported that friends in Arkansas were encouraging him to
run for Senate from Arkansas in 2002. A White House spokesman, Joe
Lockhart, quoted the president as disputing the story. ``I think
his quote to me was, `That story is crazy and I don't know where
they got it from,' '' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Clinton spent the day in New York _ preparing for a
three-day swing across New York next week to announce that she is
creating an exploratory committee for a Senate run _ Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, a Republican who is seeking to challenge her, prepared to
fly to Mrs. Clinton's home town, Chicago, for a fund-raiser Tuesday
night. As part of the trip, Giuliani plans to attend a Chicago Cubs
baseball game, presumably in an attempt to lampoon Mrs. Clinton's
attempt to portray herself as a New York Yankees fan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before coming to New York, Clinton spoke to about 60 Democratic
donors in Westport, Conn., at a luncheon that was expected to raise
$400,000. The president repeated earlier remarks in Washington
about a larger-than-expected federal budget surplus and called on
Republicans to work with him on measures to ensure the long-term
solvency of Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was introduced in Westport as a president taking a
well-deserved victory lap _ a characterization with which Clinton
took issue, suggesting that he still considered himself relevant in
national political debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I'm on a victory lap or a final lap,'' Clinton
said with a laugh. ``They're beginning to talk to me as if I'm _
there is a sort of ring of eulogy about all of this. As far as I
can tell, I'm reasonably healthy, I still show up.''

WHITMAN QUIETLY SIGNS BILL LIMITING TEEN-AGE ABORTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Avoiding the kind of public fanfare that she
often uses when she signs major legislation, Gov. Christie Whitman
signed into law Monday the first significant restriction on
abortion rights in New Jersey in more than 20 years, prohibiting a
girl younger than 18 from obtaining an abortion unless her parents
are notified.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, who has built a national reputation as a moderate
Republican by supporting abortion rights, signed the measure in the
privacy of her office, just hours after conducting a highly
publicized bill-signing ceremony to enact the state's $19.5 billion
budget for fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey conservatives stunned many lawmakers in Trenton early
this month by quickly ushering the bill through the Legislature
during the last two weeks before summer recess. Whitman, who had
long opposed parental notification, acknowledged Monday that she
began negotiating with legislators after they presented her with a
bill that had been approved by a veto-proof majority.
</P>
<P>
   And she said she agreed to sign the bill only after persuading
its sponsors to include exceptions for pregnant teen-agers who can
prove to a judge that they are mature enough to make the decision
on their own and for cases in which there is evidence of physical,
sexual or emotional abuse by a parent or guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation strikes a common-sense balance that
recognizes the rights of parents to know when a medical procedure
will be performed on their minor child, while preserving a young
woman's legal right to choose whether or not to have an abortion,''
the governor said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day she rejected suggestions that she was trying
to play down the abortion bill-signing, saying that she signed a
dozen measures Monday without public ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, which will take effect in 90 days, will make New
Jersey the 39th state to require either parental notification or
parental consent for minors seeking abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights supporters have pledged to challenge the
constitutionality of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lenora Lapidus, legal coordinator for the American Civil
Liberties Union, said early this month that she believed the law
violated the state Constitution's guarantee of equal protection
because it would deny minors access to the same health care options
available to women over 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey's state Supreme Court, in its past decisions, has
ruled that the state Constitution gives broader protection to
reproductive rights than the U.S. Constitution,'' said Ms. Lapidus,
noting that courts in four states have struck down parental
involvement laws. ``And we're confident that they will rule that
way in this case as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But abortion opponents say that similar bills have been upheld
in many other states, and that New Jersey's law was carefully
crafted to withstand a court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   John Tomicki, the conservative lobbyist who helped negotiate the
bill, said he suspected that any court challenge of the parental
notification law would be financed largely by abortion providers,
like Planned Parenthood, whose employees' livelihoods are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that these people are putting profits in
front of parents' rights,'' said Tomicki, director of the League of
American Families.

EDITORIAL: RESTRAINT ON REBUILDING SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 3rd graf, 1st sentence to make it read: in Kosovo, stead of
in Serbia) 
(af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 29: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As NATO peacekeepers struggle to quell ethnic violence in
Kosovo, the West is considering the larger job of reconstruction in
the Balkans. The initial impulse to limit aid to Serbia while
Slobodan Milosevic remains in power is right. Some humanitarian
assistance is justified, but no money should go to Milosevic or his
government.
</P>
<P>
   The West has agreed to raise money for the rebuilding of Kosovo
and Montenegro and economic development aid for Macedonia, Albania
and other neighboring countries that suffered because of the war.
The idea is to help them recover and tie the region more closely to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While few Serbians showed interest in the atrocities their
countrymen were committing in Kosovo, they do not deserve to freeze
this winter because of it. Democracy will be furthered in Serbia if
people get over their fury with the West and realize that it is
their leader, not ordinary Serbs, who is the target of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever possible, humanitarian aid should go to Serbia through
independent groups, such as nongovernment organizations, opposition
political leaders who run cities like Nis and Cacak and the
Orthodox Church, which recently called for Milosevic to step down.
Serbia has a temporary shortage of commodities that can most easily
bypass the government _ food and medicine. But the long-term threat
is a winter of rolling electricity blackouts, which will cut heat
and water for many. The country's electric power system should be
rebuilt, but through the work of foreign companies or those owned
by the opposition in Serbia. The West should support democracy in
Serbia by helping groups like the independent media and opposition
mayors, perhaps even helping them rebuild factories or
infrastructure in their cities.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult reconstruction issues is what to do
about roads and bridges needed by Serbia's neighbors. Bulgaria, for
example, depends on Serbia's portion of the Danube river _
currently blocked by bombed-out bridges _ for shipping. The river
should be cleared of debris so commerce can resume, but the West
ought not to rebuild the bridges.
</P>
<P>
   If the reconstruction of Bosnia is prologue, then money will
surely fall short of what Kosovo, Montenegro, their Balkan
neighbors and democratic groups in Serbia need. Serbia's most basic
need is not economic help, but democracy, which is best furthered
if Milosevic is denied Western aid. &QL;

WHITE HOUSE DRUG CHIEF CRITICAL OF N.Y. LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the retired general who directs the White
House's drug control policy, has added his voice to the criticism
of the mandatory prison sentences required under New York's
stringent drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech scheduled for Tuesday before a conference on
substance abuse and criminal justice in Albany, N.Y., McCaffrey,
the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, asserts
that building more prisons, as New York is doing, will not solve
the problem of drug-driven crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even those who helped pass the Rockefeller-era laws now have
serious concerns that these laws have caused thousands of low-level
and first-time offenders to be incarcerated at high cost for long
sentences that are disproportionate to their crimes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Treating offenders for drug addiction instead of just locking
them up will reduce crime as well as prison costs, McCaffrey
contends, according to an advance copy of his speech. ``The larger
question we need to focus on is: What is the most effective way to
deal with the interrelated problems of substance abuse and the
crime it generates?''
</P>
<P>
   The general's trip to Albany is one stop in his new campaign to
persuade politicians, law enforcement officials and ordinary
Americans across the country that imprisoning people for some drug
offenses only breeds more criminality in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey notes a new study by John DiIulio, a Princeton
University professor, reporting that one-fourth of recent
admissions to prisons in New York involve felons whose only crimes
have been low-level, nonviolent drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prisons have become akin to graduate schools of crime,''
McCaffrey says in his prepared speech, ``four- to six-year
`mid-crime-career' breaks during which the chronic drug and alcohol
abusers are sent away to perfect their ugly trade and to learn even
more dangerous criminal acts from those who have already moved up
the hierarchy of criminal offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's drug laws, enacted more than 26 years ago when the
late Nelson Rockefeller was governor, are among the toughest in the
country. They require state judges to impose sentences as long as
15 years to life for the sale of as little as two ounces, or
possession of four ounces, of heroin, cocaine or other hard drugs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more than 22,300 drug offenders, who make up
one-third of New York's state prison population, are locked up,
raising confinement costs by $715 million a year, according to the
Correctional Association of New York, a prison watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although anecdotal evidence suggests that thousands of
first-time drug offenders are diverted from prison into treatment
by judges in New York state'' McCaffrey says, ``the number is still
far too small relative to the overall number of drug-offense
arrestees.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrion Aubry, the chairman of the state Assembly's Corrections
Committee, has proposed legislation that would give sentencing
discretion back to the judges. Former state Sen. John Dunne tried
to rally support for a similar measure. But attempts to end the
mandatory minimum sentences have been thwarted by Albany's partisan
politics and a fear among Republicans and Democrats of looking soft
on crime.

 &HT;    Marriott plans full-service hotel in Round Rock, Texas
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A 300-room Marriott hotel will help anchor a
major Round Rock development, making it one of the few new
full-service hotels planned in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Details about the hotel were disclosed at the early morning
groundbreaking of the 329-acre La Frontera mixed-use development
Monday. The development also will include 800,000 square feet of
stores and restaurants, a 16-screen movie theater, a 4 million
square-foot office campus and hundreds of apartments.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of a new full-service hotel will likely be felt
beyond the Williamson County line.
</P>
<P>
   A Cincinnati hotel developer, whose identity has not been
released, has a contract for the Marriott land and should close on
it by early next year, said Dan Listrom, president of First
Regional Properties Inc. The hotel could open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-story hotel would include 30,000-square-feet of
meeting space with a 16,000-square-foot ballroom. It also would
include restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott operates a 365-room, full-service hotel at 701 E. 11th
St., which was built in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Round Rock city officials believe a full-service hotel will make
their city more attractive to prospective as well as existing
businesses such as Dell Computer Corp. Although the city has 850
hotel rooms within the city limits, it has no hotels with banquet
facilities or meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always felt we were lacking that piece of the puzzle,''
said Phil Brewer, executive director of the Round Rock Chamber of
Commerce, adding that he has worked to attract a full-service hotel
to the city for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy economy, rising demand and a crop of fast-growing
hotel chains have contributed to an ongoing hotel boom in the
Austin area. The number of hotel rooms has swelled from 14,300 in
1997 to an estimated 18,350 this year.
</P>
<P>
   But almost all of these new hotels have been smaller
extended-stay or limited-service properties _ places with names
such as Holiday Inn Express, Fairfield Inn and Courtyard by
Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   The 150-room Embassy Suites near the Arboretum opened last year,
making it the first new full-service hotel to open in Central Texas
since the Renaissance Austin was built 13 years ago. The renovation
of the Stephen F. Austin Hotel at Congress Avenue and Seventh
Street downtown will add another full-service hotel this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, room and occupancy rates haven't justified the
construction of full-service hotels, which tend to be more costly
and risky to build, said John Keeling, senior vice president of PKF
Consulting/Hospitality Advisory Services in Houston, which tracks
the hotel industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limited-service hotels are easier to build and there's more
cash for development,'' Keeling said. ``It's not that we're
building them because people want to stay in them; we're building
them because we can build them.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeling said it is to Austin's advantage to get more
full-service hotels because they employ more people, pay more taxes
and have the rooms to accommodate larger conventions. The net
effect is more business. And full-service hotels tend to fare
better, even in an overbuilt market.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of new hotel rooms in the Austin market has pushed
down the area's occupancy rate from 78.3 percent in April 1998 to
77.1 percent in April 1999. But in downtown Austin, where the bulk
of the area's full-service hotels are located, the occupancy rate
rose from 77.5 percent to 79.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full-service hotels are more competitive than limited-service
hotels,'' Keeling said.

ANGELO BERTELLI, 78, IS DEAD; QUARTERBACK FOR NOTRE DAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angelo Bertelli, the first of Notre Dame's seven Heisman Trophy
winners and its first T-formation quarterback, died Saturday at his
home in Clifton, N.J. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was brain cancer, his son Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   When Bertelli entered Notre Dame in 1940, he was 6 feet 1 inch
and 173 pounds, a skinny but highly regarded tailback in the
single-wing formation used by most college teams. Elmer Layden,
Notre Dame's coach, used the box offense perfected by his coach,
the legendary Knute Rockne.
</P>
<P>
   But when Layden left to become commissioner of the National
Football League, Notre Dame's new coach, Frank Leahy, was impressed
by Bertelli's passing talents and made major changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a fourth-string tailback on the freshman team and a
terrible runner,'' Bertelli recalled, ``and there were three
varsity tailbacks coming back the next year. Then Leahy became our
coach. He remembered what he had had at Boston College, a passing
quarterback in Charlie O'Rourke, and I went from seventh string to
first string overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sophomore, Bertelli, still a single-wing tailback, led the
nation with a 56.9 percent passing average, completing 70 of 123
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Leahy switched to a modified T-formation, in which
Bertelli would play under the center and take every snap. As he
told his budding star, ``Bert, you're the finest passer and the
worst runner I've ever coached.''
</P>
<P>
   That summer, preparing for his new role, Bertelli said he took
``a thousand snaps, maybe a million.'' He and the T-formation were
an immediate success. He passed that year for 1,039 yards and 10
touchdowns, and Grantland Rice, the celebrated sportswriter, called
him ``the T-formation magician.''
</P>
<P>
   As a senior in 1943, after six of Notre Dame's 10 games,
Bertelli was activated by the Marine Corps and his college career
ended. In those six games, he threw only 36 passes, completing 25
with 10 going for touchdowns, and he won the Heisman Trophy. Notre
Dame won the six games by an average score of 43-5 and lost only
three games in his three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli became a Marine captain, fought on Iwo Jima and Guam
and won the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. He was succeeded as
the Notre Dame quarterback by Johnny Lujack, an 18-year-old
sophomore, who would win a Heisman Trophy in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli was voted to all-America teams in 1942 and 1943. In the
Heisman voting for America's outstanding college football player,
he finished second in 1941 and sixth in 1942 before capturing the
trophy. In 1972, he as elected to the College Football Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo Bortolo Bertelli was born on June 18, 1921, in West
Springfield, Mass., to Italian immigrant parents. At Cathedral High
School in Springfield, he won all-state honors in football,
baseball and hockey and was senior class president.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, he obtained his college degree and played
for the Los Angeles Dons and Chicago Rockets in the All-America
Football Conference. His professional career ended in 1949 after
three seasons and three knee operations.
</P>
<P>
   He lived the last 48 years in Clifton, where he operated several
businesses, including a chain of liquor stores. He sponsored midget
football teams that produced, among others, Nick Buoniconti and Joe
Scibelli, who became outstanding Notre Dame and professional
players.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, Bertelli married Gilda Passerini, his childhood
sweetheart. He is survived by his wife; two sons, Michael of
Allendale, N.J., and Robert of Hoboken, N.J.; two daughters, Lauren
Bertelli of Waldwick, N.J., and Judith Wry of Manchester, Conn.;
two sisters, Josephine Tesini and Rose Enright, both of Holyoke,
Mass., and five grandsons.

A LITTLE GEHRIG FANTASY FOR REALLY BIG DOLLARS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In historic terms, it is a sacred relic worn by a
36-year-old man two years from death. The size 46 pinstriped suit
is slightly faded, the fabric soft to the touch, but heavy for
summer wear. Yet even on a steamy morning, you're tempted to hop
the No. 4 train to 161st Street, sneak into the local ball park and
try it on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you wouldn't dare because it is the uniform worn by Lou
Gehrig at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939, when, between games of a
doubleheader, he declared himself ``the luckiest man on the face of
the earth'' despite a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   And consider that the Leland's auction house in Manhattan hopes
to sell the simple flannel jersey and pants for at least $295,000
when telephone, fax and online bidding, which began last week,
concludes on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   So you would no more don the Gehrig uniform than you would
Abraham Lincoln's suit when he delivered the Gettysburg Address,
unless you are David Wells, who paid $35,000 for a 1934 Babe Ruth
cap and wore it when he pitched the first inning of a game in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fantasy piece, one of the top five you'd hope to
have,'' said Michael Heffner, the president of Leland's, as he
gazed at the uniform, freed from the protective plastic covering.
He was in a back room of the auction house, where items are packed
and unpacked and game-used autographed bats stand at attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Gehrig uniform is the most tantalizing item in an auction
that includes the home run ball Carlton Fisk hit in Game 6 of the
1975 World Series (retrieved and being sold by George Foster, the
Reds' left fielder), the ball Mickey Mantle hit off the Yankee
Stadium facade in 1956 and a saxophone given to Ruth by band leader
Paul Whiteman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a privilege to handle the thing _ you can't touch the
stuff at the Hall of Fame,'' Heffner said. ``It's a sacred piece,
but in reality, it's just flannel, which happened to be worn by
someone who was admired by a lot of people.'' Bidders should be
reminded: the uniform requires no dry cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Up close, the pinstripes are bluer than you'd imagine.
``LGehrig'' is embroidered in orange thread in the neck of the
jersey and the waistband of the pants. A ``39'' is stitched into
the bottom of the jersey.
</P>
<P>
   By matching the pattern of pinstripes _ where they meet a button
or the ``N'' of the ``NY'' on the front of the jersey _ to
photographs of Gehrig delivering his speech, authenticators
declared the suit the true thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pinstripes match to a T,'' Heffner said.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Gehrig kept the uniform from 1941, when her husband
died, until the collector Barry Halper accompanied her to her
Manhattan apartment after the 1971 Yankee Old-Timers Day. ``She
asked me up, and walked ahead of me,'' he said. ``The doorman said,
`You must be special; she doesn't let anybody upstairs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Halper recalled Mrs. Gehrig's East Side apartment, with doilies
on the sofa arm _ ``a typical elderly woman's apartment'' _ and
little memorabilia of her husband's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me she was thirsty, and I said, `Do you have any
soda?' '' Halper said. ``She said no, but she said she wanted some
hooch, a term I'd only heard in black-and-white movies. `That's
what I could use, some hooch.' I assumed it was liquor. She said,
`When you come back, I have something special for you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Halper went to a nearby liquor store, wondered how much to buy,
and settled on six bottles of J&AMP;B scotch. The ``something special''
was the uniform, which was hanging in a clothes closet. On a
photograph of her late husband, Mrs. Gehrig wrote to Halper: ``I
know Lou would want you have this.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Monday, Halper sold it at auction to four buyers
from Ohio for $306,000. Recently, the Ohio buyers consigned the
uniform to Leland's to sell. If bids do not reach $295,000, it will
be taken off the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price is what the consignors wanted,'' Heffner said. ``I
would have preferred to start lower, but I didn't want to argue.''
</P>
<P>
   Halper figures the uniform has retained its value because it is
in such good shape _ ``he probably played no more than two weeks in
it'' _ and because Gehrig's speech remains such a powerful oration.
</P>
<P>
   If the sellers are lucky, they may match the buyer's frenzy that
led to the Guernsey's auction house's selling Mark McGwire's 62nd
home run ball for $3 million, the costliest item in sports
memorabilia. The next most expensive is a rare Honus Wagner tobacco
card, which sold for $640,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before our auction, Leland's sold a Babe Ruth ball for
$126,500,'' said Arlan Ettinger, the owner of Guernsey's. The ball,
which Ruth slugged for the first home run at Yankee Stadium, sold
for the most ever at auction. Ettinger projected a minimum price of
$1 million for the McGwire sphere, but the Canadian buyer tripled
that. ``That's about 23 times the world record for a ball. So we
were surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Leland's wants the highest possible price for Gehrig's uniform
but exerts no control over a buyer who would treat it with
disrespect. Last year, for example, the Upper Deck card company
paid $23,000 for a game-used Ruth bat, then chopped it into 200
pieces for random insertion into thousands of baseball card packs.
A spokesman said Monday the uniform's one-of-a-kind status and the
steep price would keep the company from bidding. &QL;

A BIT OF NATIONAL DEBT MAY BE BETTER THAN NO DEBT ALL, EXPERTS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>

(With BUDGET-CLINTON, BUDGET-ASSESS) 
 (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton raised the mind-bending
possibility Monday that the giant national debt clock in midtown
Manhattan would soon start running in reverse _ and that by the
year 2015, the government would owe no money to investors around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that Clinton described the general
direction of the clock correctly. Barring a stock market disaster
or a Japan-like recession, the federal government's $5.6 trillion
in debt, the figure on the clock, will begin diminishing in the
next few months. That number includes debt that the government owes
to itself.
</P>
<P>
   The more important figure _ debt that the government owes
individual investors, companies and governments around the world _
has actually been in decline for the last two years. How much it
can be reduced in 15 years is a far more problematic calculation,
dependent on a huge range of economic assumptions _ chiefly the
growth rate of the national economy _ that, given the inexact
nature of such things, are most likely subject to major revision.
</P>
<P>
   But even if this country could pay off all its debts in the next
15 years, many economists and some government officials say it
might not be as great an idea as it sounds. While huge debts in the
1980s and early 1990s were a tremendous drag on the economy, just a
bit of national debt may be a very good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost hard to imagine what this country would be like
debt-free,'' said Alan Sinai, the chief economist of Primark
Decision Systems, an economic consulting group. ``But while no
politician would want to admit it, the optimal debt for the United
States is probably not zero. What that optimal level should be,
though _ now that's a subject for a real national debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, reducing the debt creates a host of advantages
for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. Treasury tames its appetite for borrowed money, it
no longer competes with homeowners looking for mortgages, for
example, or companies seeking to raise money. As a result, interest
rates have more room to fall.
</P>
<P>
   And as the debt declines _ Clinton's projections show that it
will fall below $3 trillion in 2005, and below $2 trillion in 2009
_ the amount of interest the government is forced to pay out each
year goes down substantially. That frees up even more cash, while
raising the national savings rate. And that, in turn, helps to
compensate for the free-spending ways of American consumers, who in
these boom times are barely saving.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be the biggest single advantage,'' one of Clinton's
senior economic advisers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But a debt-free United States, however, might create a more
complex, and some say a riskier, financial landscape around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   For investors around the world, there is no safer place to put
money than in U.S. Treasury bonds. When the Asian economic crisis
hit in 1997, and accelerated last year after the collapse of the
Russian economy, investors around the world put their assets into
Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   These investments help make the dollar the world's most popular
``reserve currency,'' the money other governments hold for economic
security in their central banks. And they give the United States a
subtle but significant economic clout around the world.
</P>
<P>
   If the government stops long-term borrowing, the money that
becomes available may stay in the United States, invested, say, in
mortgages or corporate debt. But if investors do not have the
security of investing in U.S. Treasuries, they may be less
interested in holding their cash in dollars, and that could affect
the dollar's value on world markets.
</P>
<P>
   Investors could put their money in another country's treasury
bonds _ say those issued by the new European Central Bank or the
Bank of Japan. But that requires taking a bet on the future of
European and Japanese currencies, adding a significant risk to the
investment.
</P>
<P>
   But is any of this likely to happen?
</P>
<P>
   That depends on a series of assumptions. The chief one is about
the future of the American economy. Clinton's projections, released
Monday, assume that the American economy will grow between 2.1
percent and 2.6 percent a year for the next 15 years. It made
similar bets for the past seven years, it was wrong every time. But
the surprise was pleasant: The economy expanded far faster, and for
far longer, than even the most optimistic government projections.
</P>
<P>
   The risk, of course, is that the next errors could be in the
opposite direction. That is exactly what happened to Japan, which
blithely assumed that the successes of the 1980s would extend into
the 1990s. It was the blunder of the decade, and the country now is
mounting up a huge debt as it tries to spend its way out of a
seven-year-long recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are difficult projections to make for even the next year
or two,'' Sinai said Monday, ``and even more difficult for beyond
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And that risk is accentuated by the fact that most of the
paydown of the debt is scheduled to occur between 2010 and 2015,
allowing plenty of time for economic and political miscalculation
or happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the government is closer to paying off the
debts that really matter than even Clinton indicated Monday. While
the debt clock reads $5.6 trillion, the figure that kicks around
the U.S. Treasury is less than half that: $2.77 trillion, when the
amount of debt held by the federal and state governments and the
Federal Reserve is subtracted. And under the president's
projections, the debt will be paid off around 2011.

ABC AND AFFILIATE STATIONS REACH FINANCIAL AGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After months of often rancorous negotiations, ABC and
the board representing its affiliated stations struck a deal Monday
that will bring the network some much-needed cash to pay for the
heavy costs of professional football, while the affiliates will
receive more commercials to sell in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ABC also agreed to some limitations on how it will re-use
programs in the future, a point of intense disagreement with the
affiliates, especially after ABC announced in April that it was
starting up a soap opera cable channel consisting of same-day
repeats of shows carried by ABC stations.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, in the new three-year deal, ABC will receive $45
million a year from the affiliates, which it will apply to the $550
million in annual costs for ``Monday Night Football.'' The network
will also receive 10 commercials in the Saturday morning block of
cartoons that had previously been controlled by the stations.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the affiliates will receive eight commercials a
week in prime time from the network. ABC is not giving up its own
commercials, however, but is carving out eight more commercials
from promotion and other nonprogram time, though Patricia
Fili-Krushel, the president of ABC, said the network might simply
add some commercials to prime time each week. She estimated the
value of the overall deal to ABC at $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The affiliates also extracted some promises from ABC not to
change the number of commercials they have the opportunity to sell,
as the Fox network did when it reclaimed 20 commercials from the
affiliates. The affiliates have also been given a financial stake
in the Soap Opera Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will limit ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Co., to
re-use other entertainment programming on cable channels only after
180 days have passed since the time the program ran on the network.
</P>
<P>
   But ABC gained other less restrictive ``repurposing rights'' on
cable as the re-use of programming is being called, including
unlimited use of any ``breaking news'' programming after a delay of
four hours on such programs as ``Nightline'' and ``The View,'' 60
days on news magazines, 48 hours on sports programs and awards
shows and 60 days on mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   Networks increasingly are looking to re-use programs on cable
channels and, in the future, digital channels, to establish new
profit centers.
</P>
<P>
   David Barrett, the executive vice president of Hearst-Argyle
Television and a member of the affiliate negotiating committee,
said he hoped the deal could ``serve as a template for future deals
between affiliates and networks.''

 &HT;    A. Jones' HRs bury Expos 13-5
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Given the remote possibility that baseball won't die
of its own natural causes in this town, they tried poisoning it
here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood was not sharp, the Braves infield was a little
duller and it didn't matter. Montreal bailed out the Braves with a
dismal pitching performance in a 13-5 runaway that taxed the
fortitude of the 7,078 who paid to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta tested the game's scoring limits, scoring four times off
a pair of Andruw Jones home runs, twice off sacrifice flies and
once off a wild pitch. Ryan Klesko drove in four runs, Brian Jordan
scored three times and the Braves won for 10th time in 14 games,
stretching their NL East lead to 4 1/2 games over idle New York.
</P>
<P>
   As an added bonus, there was a bench-empyting incident in the
seventh after Jones' second homer when Anthony Telford plunked
Randall Simon on the right elbow. But while the Braves scrambled
all over the infield to keep Simon away from Telford, the Expos
remarkably remained in their dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood (9-4) earned the victory but last just five innings
after throwing 92 pitches. He was charged with five runs, though
two were unearned because of errors by Chipper Jones and Bret
Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal closed to 8-3 in the fourth, thanks to some defensive
malpractice by Atlanta. Orlando Cabrera reached first when Boone
dropped his pop-up, and Manny Martinez's infield single moved him
to third.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood appeared to be out of the inning when Fernando
Seguignol hit a pop foul behind third base, but neither Chipper
Jones nor Ozzie Guillen could find the ball, and given another
swing, Seguignol brought in an unearned run with a single.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling through a 32-pitch first inning, when he walked
two batters, hit a third and gave up an RBI single to Vladimir
Guerrero, Millwood never really found his rhythm. Montreal scored a
second run in the third inning on a single, a double and a Guerrero
ground-out.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Miguel Batista didn't make it out of the second,
giving up seven hits to the 10 batters that manager Felipe Alou
allowed him to face.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta brutalized Batista immediately, scoring five runs in the
first five at-bats. Jordan delivered a bases-loaded sacrifice fly,
and Klesko made it 2-0 with an RBI single. Still with no outs,
Andruw Jones next launched a 1-1 fastball into the left field
stands for the Braves' second three-run homer in three games and a
5-0 lead.Thomas Stinson writes for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

NEW NETS COACH CONTENT WITH HIS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For the past seven weeks, Don Casey had
more sources than perhaps any sports reporter in America. As one of
the most well-liked people in the National Basketball Association,
Casey had general managers, coaches, players, agents and
broadcasters telephoning him with the latest Nets news they heard.
</P>
<P>
   With all sorts of different information entering his ears, Casey
labored through the Phil Jackson watch, wondered privately about
the speculation surrounding Mike Fratello and Jeff Van Gundy and
continually ordered himself not to worry. Despite the anguish,
Casey always answered the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had many fights over that portable phone coming wherever we
went,'' said Dwynne, Casey's wife of 35 years. ``Many fights!
Finally, we were in a restaurant one night, and the phone kept
ringing and I said to him, `If you answer one more call, I'm out of
here because this is no way to have dinner.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Caseys were at their favorite restaurant in Hoboken last
Friday, and the phone rang. But this time, Dwynne did not mind.
Casey, the Nets' interim coach last season, had been given the job
on a permanent basis. The club made the announcement Monday at a
press conference at the Champion Center, and Casey will sign a
three-year deal worth approximately $4 million on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really happy,'' Dwynne said. ``He really wanted it. The
fact that he had such a good rapport with the players made it
really exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   While Monday was mostly joyous within the Nets organization, the
team has been criticized both inside and outside the league for its
handling of Casey's hiring. The main contentions are with the deal
Casey was given and the time at which it was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Only the first year of Casey's deal is guaranteed, which gives
him little more than a one-year tryout. He will be paid $1.1
million for next season, which makes him one of the lowest-paid
coaches in the league. If he survives the length of the contract,
he will receive $1.3 million for the second year and $1.5 million
for the third, plus additional money for reaching certain
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets also drew reproach when the initial announcement was
made on Friday, the day the San Antonio Spurs played the Knicks in
Game 5 of the finals and one day after Van Gundy said he would
remain as coach of the Knicks. Moreover, none of the club's
principal owners _ Lewis Katz, Finn Wentworth and Ray Chambers _
were at Monday's news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Casey, who since joining the league as an assistant in 1982
has never made more than the $365,000 the Nets paid him last
season, said he is content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more money than I've ever made in my life and ever
thought I'd make in my life for a one-year period and potentially
more,'' said Casey, whose only NBA head coaching experience came in
1989 on an interim basis with the Los Angeles Clippers. ``If you
don't have six championship rings, I don't think you have
commanding presence, so you should be happy with what you have. And
I am.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Nets' ownership pursued Jackson, who rejected their
multiyear offer of approximately $7 million per year in favor of
the Los Angeles Lakers, most of the team's players wanted Casey all
along. Among the team's stars, only Stephon Marbury voiced a
preference for Jackson, but he also said he would love to play for
Casey again. So it was no surprise that Marbury, Kendall Gill and
Keith Van Horn were all smiles at Monday's press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets players say their fondness and respect for Casey stems
from his humorous personality and lack of ego. In an age when
coaches are often celebrities in their own right and sometimes vie
for the spotlight with their players, the Nets find it refreshing
that Casey does not take himself too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not have any ego at all, which is great because
there's so many egos on the floor anyway,'' Gill said. ``I guess
he's a lot like Van Gundy as far as how his players love to play
for him. Case just wants to coach and make players better and make
the atmosphere better. And that's what he did last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the other reason why I respect Casey so much is that if
you do something wrong, he'll yell at you and get on you. It's not
like it's a cakewalk, but when he yells you know he's genuine. He's
not doing it for show.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill has often referred to Casey as a father figure and as an
example told of an incident last season when he was struggling
through the worst slump of his career. Gill had asked Casey to take
him out of the starting lineup so he could better evaluate his
play. That night Casey called him on the phone to make sure
everything was all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me up at 3 o'clock in the morning and stayed on the
phone with me until 4:30,'' said Gill, a 10-year veteran. ``We
weren't even talking about basketball. We talked about other
things. I've never had a coach in the pros do that to me, and that
shows you that he's not only concerned about the basketball player,
he's concerned about you as an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Nets conducted their coaching search, coaches and
officials throughout the league pulled for Casey to receive the
job. As the vice president of the coaches association, he gained
the respect of his peers by working tirelessly for a better pension
plan. And he pushed the league to start flying former coaches to
the annual pre-draft camp in Chicago so they could network with
general managers and coaches who might be looking for assistants.
``He's opened up doors for a lot of people in this league,'' said
John Nash, the Nets' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Now the door has finally been opened for him.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To every thing there is a season, the Bible says. For
jewelry the biggest season is the year-end holiday time, and this
year the extra added attraction of the millennium has jewelry
makers and retailers rubbing their hands in anticipation of another
year of record sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last five years have seen consecutive growth in jewelry
sales,'' said Lynn Ramsey, president of the Jewelry Information
Center, a trade group. ``Sales are healthier than for many luxury
items, and we expect them to continue, especially with the
millennium. It presents a great marketing opportunity. We believe
that pieces stamped 1999-2000 will become family heirlooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jewelers of America's annual business survey of independent
retail jewelers showed an average sales growth of 9.3 percent for
1998. For total retail sales of all jewelry, ``our guesstimate is
$40 billion in the United States,'' Ms. Ramsey said. That would
include $13.7 billion in gold jewelry (up 8 percent) and $22
billion for diamond jewelry alone, representing a 4 percent
increase in the number of pieces sold.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why QVC is getting on the diamond bandwagon with the
Promise Diamond collection to be offered for sale from 8 to 10
Tuesday night. The line of 40 styles of women's and men's rings,
pendants and earrings in 14-karat gold costs from $185 to $5,800.
Invited guests will get a preview of the jewelry at a lunch here
Tuesday at Le Cirque 2000, so sales hopes must be high.
</P>
<P>
   QVC reports that jewelry, including silver, gold and gemstones,
accounts for nearly one-third of its year-round on-the-air
marketing. Although the company won't give figures on jewelry
sales, it does say that total sales for last year were more than
$2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   SHAPES OF THINGS TO COME
</P>
<P>
   Some jewelers of note showed their new designs for the
millennium to the press at informal presentations last week. These
included additions to Baccarat's line of crystal jewelry, this one
called Tentation and based on the shape of the olive (for those,
perhaps, who will toast the new century with a martini), and Fred
Joaillier's curvaceous Mouvementee rings, earrings, bracelets and
pendants in sleek gold or set with precious stones.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany's offerings ranged from Elsa Peretti's new lacquer
pendants in bean or round shapes to Jean Schlumberger's corsage
bracelet with six raised flowers, each different, of diamonds and
pearls.
</P>
<P>
   Cartier is going for a younger, more casual look, which Simon
Critchell, the chief executive, describes as ``nice purchases, not
crazy at all.'' They include unadorned gold rings with flat square
tops, gold chains that look like pop-apart key chains and that can
be worn in multiples of different lengths, and tank rings of heavy
gold set with one big stone.
</P>
<P>
   HOSPITAL STYLE
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Rowley is likely to be a popular designer with some
hospital patients. She has come up with hospital gowns and pajamas
that preserve modesty and dignity by providing coverage for backs,
which standard-issue gowns expose.
</P>
<P>
   There are two women's gowns, one mid-calf style with snaps down
the back, a mock turtleneck and three-quarter-length sleeves; the
other, ankle-length, pulls over the head, with a drawstring scooped
neck, which allows a new mother to breast-feed. For men there are
drawstring pajama pants with a snap-front shirt and a matching
robe. Children get calf-length snap-back gowns with optional
drawstring panties.
</P>
<P>
   But these styles will be seen only at Hackensack University
Medical Center in New Jersey, which commissioned them and will get
them in the fall. But maybe Ms. Rowley can interest other hospitals
in providing more coverup for patients.

CONSERVATIVES IN GOP ARE UNEASY ABOUT BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: INSERTS new 14th graf, in brackets, Before boarding ..., to
add quote from Bush on prospect of conservative rebellion.) 
(ATTN: N.H., Iowa)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LACONIA, N.H. _ Many politically active conservatives say they
are increasingly frustrated and distressed by the early dominance
of George W. Bush in the Republican presidential race. They accuse
their party of sacrificing principle in the name of pragmatism,
prompting some to talk of mounting a third-party campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In early battleground states like New Hampshire and Iowa, and
elsewhere in the country, rank-and-file conservatives said in
interviews that they had never felt so alienated from their own
party.
</P>
<P>
   They asserted that Bush was not sufficiently conservative on
matters like abortion and complained about the defense _ if not
outright embrace _ of Bush by the party establishment, including
some leaders of their own wing, like Pat Robertson, founder of the
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   They also cited compromises by Republican leaders in Washington
on issues like taxes, gun control, military spending and gay
rights. They are all the more uneasy, these conservatives said,
because they fear even at this early stage that Bush may be
unstoppable since no conservative champion has emerged from the
right to take on the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The disenchantment is so intense that more and more
conservatives at the grass roots are openly discussing whether to
bolt from their party altogether. One conservative who is running
for president, Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire, said he was so
fed up that he would decide in the next 30 days whether to seek the
presidency by creating his own party or running as a member of the
Reform or U.S. Taxpayer party.
</P>
<P>
   Another conservative contender, Pat Buchanan, the television
commentator, insisted last week that he would remain in the
Republican contest. But some of his advisers have recently mulled
over whether he should seek the nomination of the Reform Party of
Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   The discomfort among conservatives erupted in full view at a
town meeting in Manchester last week sponsored by Think New
Hampshire. The group was established by Jim Rubens, a former
Republican state senator who ran for governor last year, to promote
the party's principles. On a breezy summer night, more than 100
local Republicans gathered in an auditorium to stew over the state
of their party.
</P>
<P>
   The theme, as set out by Rubens at the start of the meeting, was
to ponder ``the gnawing question'' that he feared had
``demoralized'' Republicans: ``How do we resolve the tug of war
between principle and pragmatism _ between party ideals and the
pressure to compromise them?''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the audience voiced concerns that Republicans with an
eye on a general election victory in 2000 were moving too quickly
to dilute their positions on bedrock issues like abortion. Despite
Bush's command of the Republican field, not one participant
defended the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kenny, a freelance journalist in Manchester, drew
enthusiastic applause when he rose to a microphone in the audience
and asked: ``I wonder if any of us can tell the difference between
the Gore-Bush twins?''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny echoed many others who expressed concern about Bush,
including his refusal to rule out appointing court justices who are
not foes of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   David Corbin, a state representative in New Hampshire who
supports Alan Keyes for the nomination, said Bush might win the
nomination but lose the following November because he would not be
seen as standing for anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George W. will win 35 percent of the New Hampshire
primary vote,'' Corbin said, ``but if the idea is winning at any
cost, it may do more damage to the Republican Party in the long
term.''
</P>
<P>
   [Before boarding a plane in Austin, Texas, Monday night, Bush
said he was not worried about the prospect of a conservative
rebellion. ``Well, I say come and look at my record,'' he said.
``I've been the governor of the state of Texas. I've now gone
through three legislative sessions. I've done in office what I said
I would do. And they ought to come down and look at our education
program, or my tax cutting.'')
</P>
<P>
   In Davenport, Iowa, the state that traditionally holds the first
caucuses, David Karwoski, a religious conservative organizer, said
that if Bush captures the nomination he could lose as Bob Dole did
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to placate the pro-choice people and the pro-life
people at the same time,'' said Karwoski, who is backing Gary
Bauer, ``the people who feel strongly about those issues are going
to have a huge question in their mind: Is he really with us? Can we
trust him? There's going to be a rude awakening in November.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews around the country, conservatives repeat the same
mantra: They are worried that Bush is getting ``anointed.'' As
Gordon MacDonald, the New Hampshire director for the campaign of
former Vice President Dan Quayle, put it, ``There's a real concern
that the establishment of the party is foisting on them a candidate
who won't stand for their principles. It's feeding this
alienation.''
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives speak enthusiastically about the prospect of
abandoning the Republican Party. Citing how the Whigs unraveled in
the 1800s after the party was unable to reach a consensus on
slavery _ and paved the way for Republicans _ several conservatives
said Republicans could be similarly ravaged over abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you I'm not optimistic about the future of the
Republican Party,'' Richard Lessner, director of the editorial page
of The Union Leader, a beacon of conservatism in Manchester, said
at the town meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his participation on a radio talk show in Arizona
recently, Lessner said: ``What really sparked the telephone calls
is when the subject of third party came up. We can paper over this
talk. We can pretend that it doesn't exist. We can urge all
Republicans simply to set aside their differences and get together,
not shoot at one another, don't call one another nasty names,
everything will be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the sentiment out there for a third party is real,''
Lessner continued. ``It is deep. And it is growing. We had call
after call on that radio talk show out there, people calling and
saying, `You know, I'm a conservative, but I've just about given up
on the Republican Party.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Thomas Rath, a former state attorney general
who supports former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, implored the
audience to be more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop ripping each other's throats out in
primaries,'' Rath said. ``Ronald Reagan was right when he said a
person who agrees with me 80 percent of the time is not my enemy.''

 LACONIA, N.H.: my enemy.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a Republican barbecue on Sunday at the Belknap County 4-H
Fairgrounds near here, Elizabeth Dole, who runs a distant second to
Bush in most polls, said in an interview that the party needed to
be more pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to her view that the party need not press for a
constitutional amendment on abortion, she said: ``This is a
dead-end discussion because it's not going to happen. Let's don't
fight each other in the party over something that doesn't have a
chance of happening. We're just churning and spending energy within
the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk infuriates Smith. In weighing a third-party bid, he
said he was worried that in the eagerness to broaden its appeal the
Republican Party was forfeiting its principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have one political party in America: It's run by
moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans, and conservatives are
stuck,'' Smith said in an interview. ``If you talk to conservative
activists there's a lot of frustration. I have no desire to see the
demise of the party. But I'm not going to see our views
compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Bush's impressive support, many conservatives are even
more unsettled because there are so many conservatives vying for
the nomination that their field is fractured and no one has emerged
to take on the leading candidate. Smith, Quayle, Buchanan and
Bauer, the former head of the Family Research Council, are
competing on the right with Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher,
and Keyes, a former State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate on the right who seemed to be gaining steam among
conservatives last year was Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri. But he
decided not to make the race, in part because he faces a tough
re-election challenge in 2000. Compounding the difficulties is the
fact that religious conservative groups seem to be losing
influence, particularly the Christian Coalition, which has been in
turmoil in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The activists can't get together on one candidate,'' Smith
said. ``If all of us were one candidate instead of split up, we'd
have 15 to 20 percent in the polls right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans have little sympathy for such talk. They say
conservatives should be grateful that Bush is playing smart
politics as Bill Clinton did in 1992 when he moderated his
positions and called for welfare reform, a balanced budget and a
middle-class tax cut. As Clinton did, Bush is following more of a
general election strategy _ appeal to the broadest base of support
_ in the primaries. For now at least, polls show that it seems to
be working.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers say they are confident that the governor is
popular enough to withstand attacks from conservatives without
moving to the right. Still, the hope among Democrats is that Bush
will be forced to appeal more to conservatives, which would make
him more vulnerable in a general election, when he would want to
win votes from independents and even Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among conservatives there is an enormous frustration because
the party isn't what it was four years ago,'' said Roger Stone, a
Republican strategist who is a moderate. ``The Christian Coalition
is in hard times. There's a tremendous thirst in the party to win.
Therefore, it seems to me that Bush is getting the pass that Dole
didn't get. I don't see any of these other guys getting any
traction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dave Philbrick, a conservative from Dover, is among those
who said he would not succumb to the allure of Bush as a candidate
who might win the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather,'' Philbrick said, ``go to bed with a clear
conscience after losing.''

 By SUSAN SACHS and JASON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alone in the world but for the father he had never
seen, a determined 13-year-old boy equipped with a little money and
enough pluck to charm a string of helpful strangers, set out for
New York City from his hurricane-devastated village in Honduras
last month to find his father.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Edwin Daniel Sabillon, carrying a paper bag with a
change of clothes, his birth certificate and three cookies, arrived
on a bus from Miami on Sunday. With the aplomb that carried him
through his 3,200-mile journey, he hailed a cab and went looking
for his father.
</P>
<P>
   He did not find him. But the police, who picked the boy up after
being alerted by the concerned taxi driver, said Monday that they
will take up Edwin's search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary concern is that he is reunited with his father,''
said Capt. Thomas Kelly, of the Bronx Detectives.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin, he added, has nothing to worry about. Although he entered
the country illegally, the boy's story has touched the
highest-ranking heart in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's under the protective custody of the mayor's office,''
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the youngster is in the hands of the city's
Administration for Childrens Services, which Monday was arranging
for him to spend the night with a Spanish-speaking foster family
while the police continued to hunt for his father.
</P>
<P>
   The father was identified as Grevi Sabillon Vasquez. Detectives
said they do not know what the father does, where in the city he
lives, or whether he is a legal or illegal immigrant. What they do
know about him comes, essentially, from the bits and pieces of
information they gleaned from Edwin.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said he wrote to his father last year, after Hurricane
Mitch roared through Honduras and wrecked his home in Colonia San
Miguel, a suburb of the capital Tegucigalpa. A mudslide, apparently
triggered by the torrential rains of the storm, had killed his
mother, Angela Enamorado, and his 14-year-old brother, Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the father wrote back. As recounted by the police,
who read the letter, he instructed the boy to come to New York
City. He said he would meet him at the entrance to LaGuardia
Airport. He gave three rendezvous dates: June 25, 26 and 27. I will
be wearing a white shirt, black pants, white sneakers and a black
hat, the father wrote, but I will recognize you.
</P>
<P>
   Then the father sent $200 by wire to Honduras and on May 22,
Edwin left the house of friends in San Francisco de Yojoa Cortez,
and set out on a journey that would take him 37 days.
</P>
<P>
   The adventures along the way that he recounted to detectives
sound like the Huckleberry Finn tale in reverse: A stubborn boy
sets out on the road to join his father, steals across the borders
of three countries, gives the slip to lawmen along the way, loses
his possessions and gets rescued by a succession of good
Samaritans.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it is also an improbable tale of luck and
generosity along a route that most often is paved with hardship and
greed.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin said he hitchhiked up the Honduran coast through Guatemala
and into Mexico. In Matamoros, a town bordering Texas, he said he
won the sympathy of smugglers who agreed to arrange his passage for
free. The normal price for the often hazardous and sometimes deadly
journey is $5,000, according to lawyers who work with Central
American immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran consular officials in New York and the police were
checking details of the boy's account and his background.
</P>
<P>
   According to the boy's account, he then found a ride to Houston
and then, inexplicably, went to Miami. Somewhere along the way, he
lost his wallet with most of the money his father had sent him and
the slip of paper on which he had written his father's address.
</P>
<P>
   But his luck held. In Miami, he found his way to the Natasha
Cafeteria, where the Cuban-American owner and his patrons took the
boy in blue jeans and a yellow T-shirt into their embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a five-dollar bill in his hand and he was asking for
change _ four dollars in quarters to take a bus to take him to I-95
North to see how he could get to New York,'' recalled Emilio Jose
Jimenez, who was in the cafeteria last Saturday when Edwin turned
up.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, he said, seemed educated and well-mannered. The
customers took up a collection to buy him an $87 bus ticket so
Edwin would not have to hitchhike, gave him pocket money for food,
took him to the bus station, and bade him goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin arrived in New York City at about 2 p.m. on Sunday. The
police said he got off the bus at 177th Street and Broadway and
then did what most newcomers do: He gaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's walking around, he's amazed by the tall buildings, all
the hustle and bustle, where's the countryside,'' said Det. Gilbert
Ramirez, recounting how the boy described his first hours in the
new city.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening, at 8:30, Edwin was spotted by Jose Basora, a
35-year-old taxi driver who emigrated from the Dominican Republic
10 years ago. At first, Basora said, he thought Edwin was one of
the battalion of young boys who sell flowers in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him looking at me, he was smiling, he was happy,''
Basora recalled. ``Then he came to me and asked me if I can take
him to the airport and how much it would be. I found this strange
because he was a little boy. The light turned green, I told him to
get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwin soon told him of his search for his father. Basora, moved
by the story, drove him around the edges of the airport for 15
minutes, trying various entrances. When he could find no sign of
the father, who had not specified a time for his son to meet him,
the two drove to Basora's home in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, after making sure Edwin showered and buying him
some in-line skates, Basora went with the boy to the 43rd Precinct
nearby. Edwin slept there Sunday night and Monday he gorged on
hamburgers and ice cream and slept some more.
</P>
<P>
   Eyleen Schmidt, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Washington, said that Edwin may have
several options for remaining in the United States, depending on
his father's status.
</P>
<P>
   If the father is in the country legally, he may petition to have
his son join him. If he is not here legally, he may apply up until
July 5 for a temporary work permit through a six-month-old federal
program intended for Honduran immigrants in the aftermath of
Hurricane Mitch. Ms. Schmidt said that the immigration agency would
then recommend that Edwin be allowed to stay with his father for as
long as the work permit is valid.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they are monitoring an overpass near LaGuardia
Airport because they believe Vasquez, the boy's father, may have
meant that location for the meeting with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the police, the children's services
agency and his office would do what they could to find Vasquez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do the best that we can to try to help him,'' the mayor
said. ``I think that's the only fair and decent thing to do.''

   Suit: Doctor cut out parts of healthy lung
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Van Sickler
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ Lawnwood Regional Medical Center has been
named in a lawsuit claiming that the hospital tried to cover up a
misdiagnosis of cancer that led to the removal of portions of a
healthy lung from a 61-year-old Navy veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart, Fla. attorney Willie Gary filed the suit on behalf of
John Hawley, claiming that Lawnwood not only failed to properly
examine, evaluate and treat Hawley, but also conspired to conceal
lab evidence that Hawley's lung was healthy before and after parts
of it were removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case about a cover-up,'' Gary said at a news
conference Monday. ``The worst kind imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, Hawley, now 63, went to the Lawnwood
emergency room in December 1997 complaining of shortness of breath,
fever and chills.
</P>
<P>
   Hawley told the doctor that he was a former smoker, and that he
quit in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint said that Hawley was admitted to the hospital for
pneumonia, and during the stay, a biopsy of Hawley's right middle
lobe was reviewed by the hospital's pathology lab.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor concluded, incorrectly according to the lawsuit, that
the lung was cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, portions of Hawley's right lung were removed.
</P>
<P>
   Those portions were sent to the pathology lab and studied, but
this time, the portions showed no sign of cancer, according to the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of telling Hawley about these results, his doctors told
him they had removed all of the cancer, the lawsuit states.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when he reviewed his medical history, Hawley found out
that he never had cancer. That's when he contacted the law firm of
Gary, Williams, Parenti, Finney, Lewis, McManus, Watson, &AMP;
Sperando.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little mad,'' Hawley said Monday. ``Somebody cut my
lungs half off and for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Lawnwood Regional Medical Center have not seen the
lawsuit and could not comment, said spokeswoman Janie Hellstrom.

ORGANIZERS OF TOUR DE FRANCE HOPING TO MAKE A CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ That hum coming from the headquarters of the Tour de
France is an ancient mantra: It's not champions who make the Tour;
it's the Tour that makes champions.
</P>
<P>
   The chant is sounded whenever, like this year, the world's
greatest bicycle race is bereft of some of its biggest names. So
bereft is the 86th edition that, for the first time in memory,
there will probably not be a single previous Tour winner at the
starting line in western France on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Indurain, the Spaniard who won from 1991 to 1995, is long
retired. Bjarne Riis, the Dane who triumphed in 1996, is out with a
broken right arm after a fall in the Tour of Switzerland this
month. Jan Ullrich, his German successor in 1997, is at home with
pain in his right knee after a crash in the Tour of Germany a few
weeks ago. And Marco Pantani, last year's hero, is in Italy both
sulking and under a cloud after he failed a blood test in the Giro
d'Italia early this month.
</P>
<P>
   Many other stars are on the sidelines, too, including Laurent
Jalabert (also sulking), Michele Bartoli (injured), and Richard
Virenque and Francesco Casagrande (spurned by the organizers).
Their absence, however, does not necessarily mean that the race
will be wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who can win this year,'' said Bobby
Julich, the 27-year-old American rider for the Cofidis team who
finished third in the last Tour. When pressed, he could not come up
with an especially long list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself,'' he started, ``Lance, of course,'' referring to Lance
Armstrong, the American leader of the U.S. Postal Service team.
``Olano, Zulle, Boogerd. Perhaps Vinokourov can pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously not the usual suspects. I think it's going to be
young, up-and-coming talent, hopefully myself included.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet most of those names are familiar in Tour final standings.
Abraham Olano, 29, a Spaniard with ONCE who looks and sounds like
Indurain and sometimes even rides like him, having finished fourth
in the Tour two years ago, has been an outside favorite before. So
has Alex Zulle, 31, a Swiss now with Banesto, who finished second
in the race four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Boogerd, 27, a Dutchman with Rabobank and the winner of
the Paris-Nice stage race this year, finished fifth in the 1998
Tour. ``He's a class act,'' Julich said, and observers agree,
making him the early favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Vinokourov, 25, a Kazakh with Casino, seems ready in
his Tour debut to move up in quality from the lesser races he has
been winning for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   As for Armstrong, 27, he has ridden strongly the last month in
time trials and in the mountains _ the keys to winning the Tour _
but has finished the three-week race only once.
</P>
<P>
   The list may be shortened or altered when the 20 invited teams
of nine riders each gather in Le Puy du Fou, the starting point for
the 3,680-kilometer (2,286-mile) trek clockwise around France, with
a foray into Italy. Olano's ONCE team has threatened to defy the
organizers and attempt to bring along two officials who have been
banned in the ongoing drug scandals. If they are refused
credentials, the team has said, it may withdraw, as it did last
year to protest the police investigation of doping.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of the three other Spanish teams would follow ONCE,
as they did last year, is doubtful but unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Another unknown factor is Pantani's state of mind. He began
complaining immediately after the Tour unveiled its schedule last
fall _ a prologue, two long time trials and 18 other daily stages.
</P>
<P>
   By Pantani's lights, the mountains were not challenging enough
and the time trials were too long. Before he was ejected from the
Giro, he often said that he would not ride in the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   He is still saying that, despite heavy pressure from his
sponsors and friends to take his revenge in France for the
humiliation in Italy. His Mercatone Uno team is invited to the Tour
and, at the moment, is due to be led by Stefano Garzelli, 26,
another fine Italian climber, if not one in Pantani's class.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if Pantani changes his mind and decides to ride the
Tour? He has served his two-week suspension and is, at least
theoretically, eligible to participate.
</P>
<P>
   But the organizers withdrew an invitation to the Vini Caldirola
team from Italy on June 18 after one of its best riders, Sergei
Honchar, failed the same blood test in the Tour of Switzerland that
Pantani did. Honchar would have completed his suspension the day
before the Tour de France started and thus also would have been
theoretically eligible.
</P>
<P>
   If Pantani does not turn up, it will be the first time in three
decades that a Tour winner who was still competing and not injured
failed to defend his championship.

THE BAILING OUT OF SPORTS AGENTS: IS IT BUSINESS OR FEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The easy cheap shot _ and who am I to
resist? _ is that it's the classic case of rats abandoning the
sinking ship.
</P>
<P>
   If it were true, this cataclysmic upheaval in the world of
sports would make the Titanic look like the Minnow, washing up on
``Gilligan's Island''.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, that's not Ginger and the Professor tiptoeing
through the sand. These people leave Godzilla-sized footprints in
their wake.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be ``rats'' are sports agents and the ``sinking ship''
is baseball, but don't believe everything you hear until the cash
register stops ringing.
</P>
<P>
   There's big business doings afoot in the land of sports and
games, yet it almost slipped by somewhere in the fine print, filed
innocently under that oh-so-benign heading, ``Transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks Brother sports agency: Sold.
</P>
<P>
   David Falk sports agency: Sold.
</P>
<P>
   ProServ: Sold.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the biggest sports agencies in the business, selling
out just like that, and rumors flying that superagents Leigh
Steinberg and Jeff Moorad will be right behind, divesting
themselves of the baseball-side of their operation for a whopping
$50 million, if you believe one published report.
</P>
<P>
   These are definitely not nickel-and-dime operations we're
talking about here and while agents in general have rightfully
earned something of a slimy reputation, these are the granddaddy
bullfrogs in the pond, folks who are well-respected _ and sometimes
even genuflected to _ throughout their industry.
</P>
<P>
   Falk is an NBA heavyweight, even charged by some insiders as the
man behind the NBA labor dispute that almost cost the league its
1999 season. Alan and Randy Hendricks, whose client list includes
Roger Clemens, announced their sale last week. Both were bought out
by SFX Entertainment of Houston, and then re-signed to employee
service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, speculation is rampant in baseball that these
heavyweights in the agent industry are getting out while the
getting is good, before the next catastrophic labor showdown when
the current Basic Agreement is up in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating gossip, says Moorad, but just not true. And that
includes the $50 million he and Steinberg are supposedly about to
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be nice,'' an amused Moorad said yesterday. ``I
just wish somebody had told me about it. Please know that we're not
getting out of the baseball business. That's the furthest thing
from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Might we do something at some point, partner with a larger
group? Yes. We've talked to SFX and we've been talking to a
financial services group that would obviously be interested in
having access to our clients. But we haven't done anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The key word in that sentence is obviously ``yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Moorad, who will have lunch with his latest star client today in
Anaheim _ one Ruben Mateo, Texas Ranger _ points out that he and
Steinberg have been through labor strife before. It doesn't scare
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between you and me, I'm not running from it,'' he said.
``That's preposterous. Labor problems are part of the landscape of
sports and not just something that's exclusive to baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   This _ a large company gobbling up smaller ones to form an even
larger entity _ is simply another evolution in the big business of
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a couple of big players in the market, looking
to acquire these businesses, and there are a couple of agencies in
the latter stages of their maturity whose principles are in their
late 50s and they are ready to cash out,'' is the way Barry
Meister, who represents Rangers' infielder Luis Alicea, sees it.
``For the companies which are doing the buying, this provides a
ready source of athletes for the other things they do. SFX may see
an opportunity to work both ends of the ledger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, I have several old W2 forms on file with ``SFX''
stamped them. At one time, SFX owned KRLD radio, among other
stations nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Bob Sillerman, whose reputation as a cutthroat business
man is widespread in the broadcast industry, was a partner of Steve
Hicks, Tom Hicks' brother, before they sold their radio operations
to Capstar. It was later acquired by Tom Hicks' company,
Hicks-Muse.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sillerman is obviously trying to put together an
entertainment conglomerate that links the entertainment industry
with high profile professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agent business is so oriented to giving the client special
service, it'll be interesting to see if it'll work this way,''
former Rangers president Tom Schieffer said. ``There are a lot of
egos involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine \Rthe agents\S are saying, `Hey, I can't believe
these guys will pay this much for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of like the former Rangers ownership group when Tom Hicks
came along with that $250 million check, huh Tom?
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' I think he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to tell the way he was giggling.

DESPITE INJURY SETBACK, FUTURE APPEARS BRIGHT FOR MATEO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ A week ago, the Rangers' future came up
limping with a strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mateo, who had been called up to replace an injured Tom
Goodwin in center field, was placed on the disabled list himself
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But never fear Rangers fans: Expect to see your future center
fielder back again in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to pay to come to the ballpark just to watch
him one day,'' says Rangers reserve infielder Luis Alicea, a
veteran of nine major-league seasons. ``That's how good he is. He's
unbelievable, and he's got that much talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite struggling through his first taste of top-of-the-line
major-league pitching, Mateo showed flashes of the player he can be
in the bigs. Facing pitchers such as Roger Clemens, David Cone and
Pedro Martinez, Mateo hit one home run, had four doubles and three
runs batted in for 33 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo's first 10 games in the major leagues did not produce
eye-popping statistics. But the Rangers and most of major-league
baseball are high enough on him that nearly every team attempting
to do business with the Rangers mentions his name as a potential
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Batista, the Rangers' Latin America scouting coordinator,
predicted as early as four years ago that Mateo would be a hit once
he made it to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Ruben in 1995, he reminded me of Raul Mondesi and
Sammy Sosa,'' Batista said. ``The first time I saw him, I thought:
`Something is there. This guy can be an All-Star in the future.'''
</P>
<P>
   That would explain why Toronto general manager Gord Ash sought
Mateo in February during the Rangers' attempts to acquire
right-hander Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of parting with Mateo made some in the
organization uncomfortable, and the Rangers' proposal put a ``knot
in my stomach,'' general manager Doug Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough deal for us to do,'' Melvin said. ``We were not
all in agreement on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays eventually traded Clemens to New York for
left-handed pitchers David Wells and Graeme Lloyd and infielder
Homer Bush, but the Rangers' inclusion of Mateo in their proposal
drove up the price the Yankees paid.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo recognizes the expectations on him, but says they do not
intimidate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can be better than what people say,'' Mateo said
quietly while sitting in front of his locker in the Rangers'
clubhouse at The Ballpark in Arlington last week. ``I just have to
work hard, but I enjoy what I'm doing. I love to play baseball.
It's my life, and I want to be the best at what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can do better, but I've faced'' the Yankees'
Clemens, Cone, Orlando Hernandez and Hideki Irabu and Boston's
Pedro Martinez, Mateo said. ``Those are the best pitchers in the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to one major-league scout, Mateo did not appear to
be overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates also noticed his potential. ``He has so much
ability,'' Rangers right fielder Juan Gonzalez said. ``He has all
the tools to become a superstar. He can run. He can throw. He can
hit. He he can hit for power, and he's a good outfielder, too.
We're going to see him for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the Rangers' two-time American League most valuable
player, could offer a glimpse of what Mateo might become.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez spent only one season at then-Triple-A Oklahoma City
and played there at the age of 20. Gonzalez hit .258 with a
league-best 29 home runs and 101 RBI during 128 games.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, 21, ranked fourth among Pacific Coast League hitters in
batting average (.340) and home runs (17) and second in RBI (58)
during 59 games with the RedHawks before his promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``A kid with that much talent and to have had as much success as
him will tend to be arrogant and cocky and let it go to his head,''
Alicea said. ``He's not that way. Now, he's very confident in
himself and what he does, but he's not cocky. He's very humble and
very professional. That's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   It serves as another reason why the sky could be the limit for
Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Batista sees Mateo, Gonzalez and Sosa as the best three
prospects he's seen to come from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Gonzalez is Juan Gonzalez,'' Batista said. ``Sammy Sosa
is Sammy Sosa, but I think Ruben could be in their class in the
future.'' d nn

ONCE A HANGER-ON, NOW A HERO, JOHNSON IS AN INSPIRATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DONALD EMMONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ With nearly a hundred basketball campers
watching yesterday, San Antonio Spurs guard Avery Johnson fired up
a mid-range, baseline jump shot that clanged off the side of the
rim at the Elzie Odom Recreation Center.
</P>
<P>
   He re-set, tried again and made the shot reminiscent of the one
he hit in the closing seconds of Game 5 of the NBA Finals on Friday
night at New York's Madison Square Garden that delivered the Spurs'
first championship.
</P>
<P>
   The message yesterday from Johnson to this group of 7- to
14-year-olds attending the weeklong camp was clear: Keep trying.
It's a message he has preached regularly at summer camps during his
11-year NBA career. Even though he was less than 72 hours removed
from sinking the biggest shot of his life, Johnson still seemed to
be the same person who kept trying long before he became an NBA
hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank God for the opportunity to be here,'' said Johnson,
who was known in the past more for his high-pitched voice than for
his outside shooting. ``I'm very blessed to be in this situation,
and it's not just because we won the championship or I hit the shot
that won the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really blessed to be here because I've had a lot of ups
and downs in my career. But it's through perseverance that I'm
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colony High School basketball coach Tommy Thomas, director
of the Premier All-Star Basketball Camp, says he wasn't concerned
that Johnson might bail out on his commitment because of a busy
weekend of celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been good about coming,'' Thomas said. ``He came
to the camp when the Spurs were 20-62 \Rin 1996-97\S and said a lot
of the same things. The only difference was the \Rcampers\S didn't
listen to him as much because he hadn't hit the last shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``His heart is still the same, and he still cares about kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spoke for approximately an hour, talking about his
journey to and through the NBA, and his game-winning shot. His
17-foot jumper gave the Spurs a 78-77 victory against the New York
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hasn't sunk in yet,'' Johnson said in response to a
question about being an NBA champion.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson attends basketball camps remembering how important they
were to his development as a player and a person. He also recalls
meeting NBA legends such as ``Pistol'' Pete Maravich and George
Gervin at camps while growing up in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Camp coordinator Mike Welch said Johnson _ a 5-foot-11 playmaker
who went undrafted and was let go by the Spurs in 1992 and '93
before rejoining them in '94 _ is an ideal camp speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose is to get a \Rprofessional\S in here and to give
these kids a little insight on what it took for them to make it to
the big time,'' Welch said. ``Somebody like Avery, who was
handicapped size-wise, worked his way up through the \RU.S.
Basketball League\S, up to being a marginal NBA player to the
ultimate: winning an NBA championship.''

VENTURA POWERS METS OVER MARLINS, 10-4 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When Robin Ventura has homered with more than one man on
base this season, the Mets have yet to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening, at a mostly deserted Pro Player Stadium, Ventura
hit a pair of three-run home runs to power the Mets and Al Leiter
to a 10-4 rout of the hapless Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the 16th in the last 21 games for the Mets
(43-33), who remained four games behind the Atlanta Braves in the
National League East. The Braves beat Montreal, 13-5.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (7-5), who fell behind 2-0 early, won for the fifth
straight time. He allowed three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's first home run, off righty Brian Meadows (5-9) with
one out in the fourth, gave the Mets a 3-2 lead. Ventura's second
home run, off left-hander Vic Darensbourg, capped a six-run fifth
and made it a 9-2 game.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, in the stadium where the Mets' season had
started nearly three months ago, Mets manager Bobby Valentine was
asked what he has learned about his team.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine talked about the emergence of both Benny Agbayani and
Roger Cedeno, about how well Edgardo Alfonzo and Rey Ordonez have
worked together, about Rickey Henderson not being over the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine also mentioned how well his bullpen has fit together
and how resilient this team has been.
</P>
<P>
   There was a pause. And then Valentine said: ``I think Robin's
blended in well. I think he adds a lot to the group.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 20, Ventura hit a pair of grand slams, one in each game
of a doubleheader sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Ventura had his first multiple home-run game with
the Mets, with whom he signed a 4-year, $32 million deal during the
off-season. There were those who wondered if the Mets had overpaid
for an infielder who will turn 32 on July 14 and who had just
endured two subpar offensive seasons while plagued by injuries. But
Ventura might have been a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The only down note for Ventura was his seventh-inning throwing
error, while trying for a double play after he had snagged a line
drive. That snapped a club-record streak of 12 consecutive
errorless games. The error was the fourth of the season for
Ventura, a five-time Gold Glove winner.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is putting together an all-star season at the plate.
Through the Mets' first 76 games, Ventura has 15 home runs, second
on the team to Mike Piazza's 16, and a team-high 59 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who also has eight solo homers and three two-run homers
this year, is on pace for 32 home runs and 126 runs batted in. He
has led the Mets in runs batted in for most of this season and is
now in the top 10 in the National League after Monday night's
outburst.
</P>
<P>
   And 14 of those runs batted in have come on two memorable days.

 &HT;    Killer sought after prison break
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than 250 armed searchers intensified a
dragnet in river swamps near Huntsville on Monday for a convicted
Dallas killer who escaped from Texas' highest-security prison in an
episode described by authorities as worthy of a Superman caper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shed all of his clothes _ everything _ after he got out
and, at this point, we believe he is naked in an area that is
heavily infested with poison ivy,'' said Glen Castlebury, a
spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ``Even so,
we consider him to be extremely dangerous. He has a long history of
combative and assaultive comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Dwayne Jones' escape from the Estelle High-Security
Unit on Sunday afternoon was the first from a Texas prison this
year and the first from the ``super max'' lockup, as the unit is
called. It came seven months to the day after seven death row
convicts pulled a headline-grabbing escape from death row on
Thanksgiving Day 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Other states with similar ``super max'' units said Monday they
have had no such escapes.
</P>
<P>
   Prison investigators said Jones, 33, fled about 12:30 p.m.
Sunday while he was being escorted by a guard from his cell to a
fenced-in recreation yard at the northeast corner of the 660-man
prison 12 miles northeast of Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Jones jerked one hand from his handcuffs and threatened to use
the cuffs to kill the female guard, officials said. As the guard
retreated for help, Jones ran across the exercise yard and scaled
the 20-foot-high, chain-link fence that surrounds it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an eight-inch space at the top and he somehow managed
to pull himself through there, dropped down 10 feet onto the top of
a (guards') catwalk, then down onto the ground,'' said Larry
Fitzgerald, another prison spokesman. ``It appears he used his
hands to tear through the fencing . . . This guy must have been
like Superman.''
</P>
<P>
   The convict quickly scaled a sensor-equipped perimeter fence,
setting off alarms and alerting another guard who fired at Jones
with a tear-gas shell. Officials said Jones then used a
triangle-shaped camera tower as a ladder to get over a second
fence.
</P>
<P>
   The tower has metal plating eight feet high on its sides to
prevent anyone from climbing it. Guards reported watching Jones
jump high enough to get a handhold above the plating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He climbed to the top of the tower and leapt flatfooted from
the tower, across the razor wire of the outside fence _ from all
indications, a distance of more than eight feet,'' Castlebury said.
``That tower is about four feet inside that fence, and his
footprint we found deeply imbedded in the dirt was about four or
five feet outside that fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones then ran across a water-filled ditch and into a wooded
area about 100 yards north of the prison, where he abandoned his
shoes and prison-issued clothing _ a move prison officials believe
was an attempt to foil tracking dogs. Shots fired
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said a perimeter guard fired once at Jones with a
.357 Magnum pistol as he ran into the woods_ and missed. A deputy
warden at the nearby Ellis Unit fired another .357 shot _ but also
missed _ at Jones about an hour later as the naked convict ran
across a clearing about a mile from the escape site.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said initial search attempts Sunday _ by guards,
state troopers and sheriff's deputies assisted by dogs and a U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service helicopter equipped with a
heat-sensing device _ failed to turn up any trace of Jones.
Investigators said temperatures well into the 90s interfered with
the device that focuses on body heat.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, searchers found a tree covered with poison ivy
where they believe Jones spent the night. ``The ivy was disturbed
and pulled out, and it was obvious someone had recently been
there,'' Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   By late Monday afternoon, the small army of searchers ringed an
area roughly 10 square miles from northeast of the prison to the
Trinity River, an area law enforcement officials described as
``heavily infested with mosquito- and snake-infested swampland.''
</P>
<P>
   Small boats from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department were
brought in to assist the search along the riverbanks. Recent rains
made it almost impossible to access much of the search area in
vehicles or on horseback, and officials said much of the search was
under way on foot.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday evening, prison officials had installed razor wire
around the base of the camera tower and welded chain-link over the
gap in the exercise yard fence.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson, director of the prison system, said the ongoing
investigation focused on how Jones slipped out of his handcuff.
Handcuffs are required whenever a convict leaves his cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fatal flaw in this incident was the inmate being able to
get out of that handcuff, and we just need to figure out how that
occurred,'' Johnson said. Searchers optimistic
</P>
<P>
   Despite no new trace Monday of Jones, searchers remained
optimistic. By late afternoon, Department of Public Safety troopers
had set up roadblocks leading to the prison, and prison guards were
stationed every 100 yards along FM 980, the main road to both the
Estelle and Ellis prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel confident at this point he is within this area, and we
think it's just a matter of time until we find him,'' Castlebury
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's escape marked the first from the Estelle High-Security
Unit, billed as Texas' most secure prison where the most violent
and troublesome convicts are housed. Castlebury, Fitzgerald and
other prison officials Monday declined comment on what went wrong
to allow Jones to escape such a place.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be under investigation,'' Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   The Estelle High-Security Unit is a self-contained prison
located just north of the Estelle Unit, which houses 2,200
convicts. Both prisons share a large wooded compound with the Ellis
Unit, located about three miles away, where seven condemned killers
broke out of death row last Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Only one, Corpus Christi killer Martin Gurule, managed to escape
from the prison. He scaled two fences much like those at the
Estelle Unit where Sunday's escape occurred and was later found
drowned in a creek.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald characterized Jones as ``much more dangerous'' than
the seven death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   A Dallas native who has been imprisoned three times, Jones was
serving 26 years for murder, attempted murder and assault of a
prison guard. Officials said he was convicted in the March 1987
shooting death of Patrick Anthony Haynes, 30, and for seriously
injuring Dallas police officer William Prettyman in a shotgun
attack early the following day as Prettyman tried to stop a car in
which Jones was riding.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said he has a lengthy arrest record _ four
stints in the Dallas County juvenile detention lockup, two terms in
Texas Youth Commission schools in Brownwood and Gainesville and a
29-day stint in a Dallas jail for robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jones' escape from what was touted as Texas' ``super
max'' prison _ the most secure of all 112 units and the prototype
for four more high-security prisons now under construction _
Castlebury said Texas still has one of the lowest escape rates of
any state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're one of the lowest in the nation for escapes and have one
of the highest recapture rates,'' he said.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Almost four weeks before Coca Cola Co.
publicly acknowledged the contamination in Belgium that led to the
biggest recall in its 113-year history, four people had become sick
at a bar near Antwerp and blamed their illness on drinking Coke, a
senior Belgian health ministry official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The first the public in general knew of the scare, which
eventually led to a total, 10-day ban on Coca-Cola products in
Belgium and spread alarms across Europe, was on June 8 after more
than 30 teen-age schoolchildren in the town of Bornem were taken to
the hospital complaining of stomachaches, dizziness and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   But, the health ministry official said, that incident had been
preceded on May 12 when the owner of a bar at Noorderwijk, a tiny
village 20 miles east of Antwerp, called both the Ministry of
Public Health and Coca-Cola Co.'s staff in Belgium to say four
adults had displayed similar symptoms after drinking Coke. As in
other cases, the four people complained that the Coke they drank
smelled strange. Neither the company nor the Belgian authorities
had alluded to the earlier incident in their accounts of the
recall. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Coca-Cola at the company's Atlanta headquarters
said the company had checked out the May 12 incident and had found
no reason to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was found in the plant, so it was thought to be an
anomaly,'' said the spokesman, Randy Donaldson. As for why the
company had not mentioned it as more recent reports of problems
with Coca-Cola products emerged, he said it was not clear that the
incidents were connected, even though the same plant in Antwerp was
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Another Coke spokesman in Atlanta, Rob Baskin, said he had not
heard about the May incident until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Noorderwijk case provides a fuller picture of the sequence
of events surrounding Coca-Cola Co.'s handling of an affair that,
by the company's own admission, has hurt its reputation and has
drawn public apologies from the company's chief executive, M.
Douglas Ivester. Coinciding with a food scandal in Belgium over the
contamination of meat and poultry with cancer-causing dioxin, it
illustrated anew why many Belgians have become nervous about the
safety of the food they buy in stores.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, the Belgian official said, the incident at
Noorderwijk seemed like an isolated incident. The Coke drunk by the
adults had been packaged in small bottles by a Coke plant in
Antwerp _ like those sold to schoolchildren in Bornem _ and,
afterwards, the four people complained of stomachaches, dizziness
and a burning sensation in the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Three of them were examined in a hospital, ``but the doctor
could not find anything,'' the official said. Samples of Coke from
the same batch were sent for analysis to a government-licensed
laboratory, and Coca-Cola was also believed to have ordered tests
on the same batch, the official said. But ``because it was one
case, because nothing was found in the laboratory, no action was
taken,'' this official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not find any poison. There was no proof that it was
linked to Coca-Cola,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   With hindsight, however, the official's account seemed to
suggest that the scare may have been building slowly in Belgium for
weeks before it blew up into a major embarrassment and marketing
disaster for the company. But, at a time when government officials
were preoccupied with the dioxin scandal _ and only weeks before
elections June 13 that brought down the government _ it appears
that the incident at Noorderwijk was simply filed away.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week, Ivester said laboratory tests
had found traces of sulfur in the carbon dioxide used to make
bubbles in sodas and had discovered that cans of Coke imported from
Dunkirk, France, had been contaminated by a chemical used on
transportation pallets. He blamed these factors for the 249 cases
of Coke-related sickness reported to the Belgian authorities. But
the Belgian minister in charge of the case, Luc Van den Bossche,
said the government did not accept this explanation, arguing that
the concentrations of the chemicals identified by Ivester were too
low to cause illness.
</P>
<P>
   The sicknesses among teen-age students in Bornem, also near
Antwerp, were the first reported of a series in other parts of
Belgium, including Bruges, Harelbeke and Lochristi. On June 14, the
government issued a highly unusual ministerial decree banning a
range of Coca-Cola products from sodas to mineral water. The ban
was eased June 17 and totally lifted June 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian health official said that, once Coca-Cola had begun
to recall its products in Belgium, several people contacted an
emergency call center to say that, for ``one or two months,'' they
had detected strange smells from some new vending machines
installed by Coke. Thousands of Coke vending machines in Belgium
remained off limits when the overall ban was lifted last Thursday
and there has been no word on when they will reopen. The smell has
been described by some of those who became sick as being like
gasoline or sulfur.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian official said that two Coca-Cola plants closed
during the ban _ at Ghent and Antwerp _ were near reopening or
already had reopened after inspections by government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian officials said the bulk of the illnesses appeared to
have been linked most to sodas produced in early June. But, despite
the easing of the restrictions, the health ministry official
insisted that the cause of the sicknesses remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been given proof of contamination, but we haven't been
given proof of the link between contamination and the symptoms,''
the official said.

 &HT;    Bush says thank you to Texan backers
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On the eve of his first campaign swing through
electorally crucial California, Gov. George W. Bush paused Monday
night to thank the Texas supporters who have helped him fill his
campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
   He has a lot to be thankful for.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, announced that Texans contributed $11 million to his
campaign during the first six months of this year. As a reward for
their efforts, the roughly 600 contributors and organizers who
showed up Monday evening at the Four Seasons Hotel were treated to
an open bar, pretzels, peanuts and the stump speech that Bush has
been delivering across the nation in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an indication that my base of support, the great state of
Texas, is strong, is vibrant, and it sends a large message to the
rest of the nation,'' Bush said of his Texas contributions.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush is expected to announce that he has collected
more than $20 million nationwide. He may have garnered as much
campaign cash as all his GOP rivals combined, and his total far
exceeds the roughly $13.7 million Bob Dole raised during the first
six months of 1995. In recent presidential races, the candidate who
has raised the most money in the first half of the year preceding
the election has won the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Texans contributed 54 percent of the money that Bush collected
during the first three months of this year. But the governor began
to make out-of-state fund-raising forays in June, so Texas money
probably represents a smaller chunk of his six-month total.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's goal is to collect $45 million or more, a figure that
would enable him to forgo federal matching money and the spending
limits that come with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty million dollars at this point in the election cycle is
phenomenal,'' said Shelia Krumholz of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a Washington-based research group that studies the role
of money in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Bush is inspiring people to open their wallets in a way
that Dole did not.
</P>
<P>
   Amarillo lawyer Roger Cox describes himself as a ``fairly
active'' Republican, but he didn't contribute to Dole because he
wasn't ``all that energized'' by the senator. Although he makes a
modest salary, Cox gave $1,000 to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sacrificed at my house for a couple of months to make up
for that contribution,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Brian Kennedy, a spokesman for Republican candidate Lamar
Alexander, cautioned against equating early fund-raising prowess
with certain victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing a Texan raise a lot of money in the year prior to a
presidential race reminds us of Presidents Gramm and Connally,''
Kennedy said, referring to previous Texas candidates who collected
millions of dollars that didn't translate into votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush collected $7.6 million during the first three months of
1999, far more than his Republican rivals. Bush's take was
especially impressive because he didn't begin collecting money
until the end of February, and didn't appear at a single
fund-raising event during that period.
</P>
<P>
   Bush first hit the fund-raising circuit on June 11, when he
raised about $800,000 in St. Louis and Chicago. Since then, he's
appeared at events in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Washington, D.C.,
South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida, collecting a
total of more than $8 million from donors in those states. In
California he'll tap into the state's wealthy high-tech community
with a Thursday fund-raising breakfast in Palo Alto. Austin
high-tech mogul Michael Dell was at Monday's event.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leaves for California buoyed by poll numbers that indicate
that he has an increasingly large lead over the rest of the GOP
field. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of Republican voters released
Monday puts Bush at 59 percent, with all ten of his rivals
languishing in the single-digits. A month ago Bush led his nearest
challenger, Elizabeth Dole, 46 percent to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, the Bush campaign announced that all but one of
the 72 Republicans in the Texas House signed a letter endorsing the
governor for president. The lawmaker who didn't sign, Rep. Charlie
Howard of Sugar Land, said he thinks Bush ``would make a great
president'' but that he never endorses candidates before the
general election.
