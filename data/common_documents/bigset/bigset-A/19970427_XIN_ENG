<HEADLINE> Security on UK Polling Day to Counter IRA Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Unprecedented security measures
are to be taken on polling day, May 1st, all over Britain to
thwart any attempt by the Irish Republic Army (IRA) to disrupt the
general election.
</P>
<P>
45,000 polling stations are to be searched for explosive
devices, extra police officers posted and some voters may be
searched according to a security plan by Home Office released here
today.
</P>
<P>
The plan was made as West Midlands police announced that two
small bombs had exploded in the rush hour at 100ft pylon by the M6
near Walsall on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police said the terrorists had come close to causing "total
devastation" and loss of life after a device blew up two of the
four legs of a 132,000 volt electricity pylon.
</P>
<P>
Home Office sources said they had no intelligence about a
specific IRA threat but recent IRA activity had given cause for
concern and there was no reason to think that the terrorists would
respect the importance of the coming election.
</P>
<P>
A senior security official said: "It is clear that the IRA's
campaign is focused on generating publicity by causing maximum
disruption at minimum risk to itself."
</P>
<P>
Home Office intends to impose tight security measures on the
polling day to avoid further disruption by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Among the precautions is the decision by the Home Office to
send all 659 acting returning officers a circular telling them how
to respond to an attack.
</P>
<P>
It says: "Provided that an adequate security plan, based on
police advice, has been put in place, it should possible to avoid
major disruption, such as evacuation of premises, in almost all
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"Should a bomb-threat be received, the police will assess its
credibility and consider, in the light of the security measures in
place, what level of response is appropriate."
</P>
<P>
"Their aim will be to enable the electoral process to continue
uninterrupted unless that would pose a clear risk to public
safety," it adds.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, launched its election
manifesto in Northern Ireland yesterday by saying that a vote for
its candidates would help to "tip the balance towards real peace".

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Titleholders the Czech Republic
rallied from behind to beat Germany 2-1 in their opening game at
World Ice Hockey Championships on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Vujtec set up two goals in the last 15 minutes to save
the day for the Czechs, who had failed to outsmart German
goalkeeper Joseph Heiss in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
Germany took the lead on a power play in the second period,
defenceman Mirko Ludemann scoring with just eight seconds left of
Ladislv Benysek's two-minute penalty for holding.
</P>
<P>
In the third period, the Czechs strung together the kind of
strings of passes that had eluded them in the opening 40 minutes,
though they were still but a shadow of the side who won gold in
Vienna last year.
</P>
<P>
Martin Prochazka found the net in the 46th minute, slamming the
puck home at the far post from a pass by Vujtek. The tired German
defence were in tatters.
</P>
<P>
With less than five minutes to play, Vujtek and Roman Simicek
broke through the German rearguard and Simicek scored the winner
virtually unchallenged.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: UN Move on Israel Good Score for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today hailed a U.N. General
Assembly resolution demanding an immediate halt to Israeli
settlements activities as a good score both for the Palestinians
and the world body.
</P>
<P>
"All states that voted in favor of the resolution, those
abstained and even the U.S. have criticized and rejected building
the Israeli settlements," Egypt's permanent delegate to the United
Nations Nabil el-Arabi said in statements quoted by the Egyptian
MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
The resolution passed in an overwhelming vote of 134-3, with 11
abstentions, at a special emergency session Thursday, urged an end
to all forms of assistance and support for illegal Israeli
activities in the occupied territories, especially settlement
activities.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. General Assembly resolution stressed the necessity of
halting aid to countries that have institutions, individuals or
firms work in building those settlements," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe all countries will take that into consideration," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Assistant Foreign Minister for International Legal
Affairs Hussein Hassouna said the resolution came in "the
framework of the assembly's missions of maintaining world peace
and security and in accordance with the U.N. Charter."
</P>
<P>
"The resolution stressed again that the U.N. is the main forum
for discussing the Palestinian issue and following up its
developments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian delegate to the United Nations Nasser
Qidwa today hailed the resolution as a very strong reaction to the
Israeli settlement operations.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the strongest resolutions by the General Assembly
demanding an immediate halt to Israel's construction of a new
settlement in East Jerusalem," Qidwa told the Egyptian Voice of
Arab radio.
</P>
<P>
The resolution reiterated that the 185-member General Assembly,
if necessary, may meet once again on the Israeli settlement
activities, Qidwa added.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also called for setting up a mechanism to report
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan within two months the latest
developments of the peace process, so that the assembly can decide
on what step to be taken next.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the Arab states to move effectively if Israel
insisted on going ahead with "political confrontation."
</P>
<P>
The resolution of the General Assembly, approved despite
negative votes from the U.S., Israel and Micronesia, demanded
"immediate and full cessation of the construction... and of all
other Israeli settlement activities."
</P>
<P>
Israel began the Har Homa construction on March 18 despite
strong Palestinian protests and international pressure. The peace
process has since grounded to a halt, leading to violent clashes
between Palestinian stone-throwers and Israeli soldiers across the
Palestinian territories.

<HEADLINE> Pak Longest Tunnel to Be Completed Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The would-be longest tunnel in
Pakistan is set to be completed late May , one month ahead of
schedule, a Chinese engineer said today at Batkhela, about 300
kilometers northwest of here.
</P>
<P>
"We've excavated 710 meters just this month into the mountain,
bringing to 2868.4 meters the total length of the tunnel we've
already completed," said Zhao Guangfa, manager of China
Geo-engineering corp., which has been undertaking the project
since January 1996.
</P>
<P>
"With the present highest speed, we're sure that we can finish
another 500 meters left by May 25," Zhao said at the entrance of
the tunnel located in a mountain near the Pathan village of the
Malakand Agency in North West Frontier province.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that the Pakistani authorities would
continue to enhance their cooperation with the Chinese engineers
to ensure a smooth completion of the tunnel, which will greatly
benefit the country's agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
The 3382-meter-long tunnel is the bottleneck of a grand
salinity control and reclamation project in the province.
</P>
<P>
The construction of upper Swat canal diversion and tunnel
works, financed by the Asian Development Bank and Swiss
Development Cooperation, falls in the areas of Swabi, Mardan and
Charsadad districts as well as in Malakand Agency of the NWFP.
</P>
<P>
The project covers an area of about 281,300 acres, which, like
other parts of the country, is affected by the menace of
waterlogging, salinity and frequent flooding due to overflowing of
the natural drains, which have significantly affected crop growth
in the region.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that upon completion of the project, crop
yields in the area will be almost doubled.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Some of the AIDS research
programs being conducted by the United States government among
women in poor countries could result in as many as 1,000 children
dying unnecessarily from HIV infections.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the Consumers International regional
office for Africa here today, adding that some of the female HIV
carriers undergoing medical experiments are given either placebos
or drugs that have not been proven effective, instead of the AZT
drug that has proved to slow down the spread of the virus.
</P>
<P>
It said these experiments are taking place in Burkina Faso,
Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, Tanzania, Thailand,
Zimbabwe and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
"The American government is paying for experiments on African,
Asian and Caribbean women which would never be tolerated in this
country. It is a clear cut double standard and for these babies
it will be lethal," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said public health experts strongly objected to trials that
denied women access to any intervention already proved effective,
such as AZT.

<HEADLINE> US to Help Its Companies to Compete in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 26 (Xinhua)-- The U.S. government will help
American telecom companies to compete in a
multi-billion-U.S. dollar market in the Middle East, a top
U.S. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
" We want our companies to have every (business) opportunity in
the region's telecommunications market," said Larry Irving,
Assistant Secretary of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
" We will provide (the region's partners)information about our
companies and provide our companies with information about
opportunities," he said, adding:" We will serve to make sure the
parties to talk to each other."
</P>
<P>
Larry made the remarks at a press conference before the Midcom
97 takes place here from April 27 to 29.
</P>
<P>
He is leading a 33-strong delegation of U.S. government
officials and senior telecom executives to participate in the
conference, the third of its kind held in the Gulf Arab country.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to focus on ways of securing funds
for multi-billion-dollar projects in the communications sector in
Saudi Arabia, Iran and other Middle East states.
</P>
<P>
The projects are designed to expand the existing networks and
set up new telephone ventures.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the conference estimate that the Middle East
needs to spend some 30 billion dollars in the next few years to
upgrade its telecom network to face growing needs.
</P>
<P>
Fierce competition are expected between regional and global
telecom companies as they race for footholds in the region, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Larry said the U.S.government will help American companies in
the race, but will not extend "specific" political and commercial
support to American participators.
</P>
<P>
"There is no specific support of these kinds and what we do is
to bring them (business parties related) to negotiation tables,
and the actual work will be done by our companies," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official also said that in the race, the Gulf region
will form the centerpiece of the business battle because Gulf
governments are pressing for urgent improvement of their telecom
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
According to the Inter-Arab Corporation for Investment
Guarantee, the Gulf Cooperation Council(GCC) states will have to
pump nearly 13 billion dollars into communications projects by
the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and
the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> ``People's Daily'' Urges Staff-Cut Efficiency Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- In a commentator's article to be
released tomorrow, the ``People's Daily'' suggests that state
enterprises could improve their efficiency by cutting the number
of their employees.
</P>
<P>
Overstaffing is a common problem faced by state-owned firms in
China, but Yanzhou Coal Mining areas, now known as the "Yanzhou
Ming (Group) Company Ltd", has succeeded in increasing its
efficiency fourfold by cutting back on the number of miners it
employs and adopting advanced technology and equipment, the paper
says.
</P>
<P>
The article praises the Yanzhou Coal Mining Administration for
its success and terms its policy the right road for other
state-owned firms to follow when carrying out reform and
development.
</P>
<P>
Only by implementing this principle can state-owned firms
increase their efficiency and obtain better economic performances,
and it is a basic task for the deepening of enterprise reform, the
paper says.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, according to the article, the most important task
for state-owned firms wishing to improve their efficiency is to
bring about scientific and technological progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region generated 38.2 billion yuan in gross domestic
product (GDP) in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a rise of 8.3 percent over the same
period of last year, sources at the region's statistics bureau
said.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural situation, in particular, has been
encouraging, as the regional government has attached more
importance to agriculture, resulting in a bumper harvest for early
rice and marked rises in the production of animal husbandry and
aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Industrial added value in the first quarter of the year stood
at 12.7 billion yuan, an increase of 7.1 percent, while the ratio
of production of manufactured goods against marketing was 85
percent, a growth of three percentage points. Exports of
locally-made commodities surged by 25.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The region has invested 2.6 billion yuan in fixed assets in the
past three months, up 11.8 percent over the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The region also recorded 15.8 billion yuan in retail sales of
consumer commodities in the first three months of this year, a
rise of 10.7 percent over the same period of last year, and
achieved 458 million US dollars-worth of imports and exports, up
4.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Singaporean Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) met with Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong here today.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting in the Great Hall of the People, Li said
that, as friendly neighbors, China and Singapore have maintained a
steady exchange of visits and contacts between their leaders and
kept extending bilateral cooperation and exchanges in the fields
of economy, science, technology and culture since they forged
diplomatic ties. China is satisfied with the smooth growth of
bilateral relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have great potential for friendly
cooperation, based on the high degree of complementarity of the
two economies, Li noted, adding that Singapore has the advantage
in skills, capital and management expertise, while China boasts
abundant natural and human resources, and a huge market.
</P>
<P>
It is worth learning from Singapore how it preserves and
promotes traditional Oriental culture in the process of absorbing
the advanced achievements of other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Li said, China needs internal conditions of unity and
stability, as well as a peaceful and friendly international
environment for its economic development.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that China pursues an independent foreign
policy of peace and seeks to maintain peace in the Asia-Pacific
region and in the world at large. It is ready to develop friendly
relations with its neighbors, including Singapore, and all other
nations, he said. This is in the fundamental interests of China
and is certainly not an expedient measure.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said his visit to China is aimed
at further strengthening relations between the two countries and
exchanging views with Chinese leaders on issues of common
concern. He said he hoped that the visit would further boost
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides conferred on regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Goh arrived here this afternoon for a working visit to China at
the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Peng.

ANKARA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Five soldiers of the Turkish
security forces were killed in recent operations against the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in southeastern Turkey, an
official statement said today.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the office of the Emergency Regional

militants in Caci mountains near Eruh town of Siirt province,
three in Bongol province and two in the Derecik area of Semdinli
town of Hakkari province linking northern Iraq and Iran.

<P>
On Saturday, Turkish reliable sources told Xinhua that dozens
of Turkish armored vehicles had crossed into northern Iraq in
preparation for launching military operations in the region
where most PKK rebels are based.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that there are better weather conditions in
the region for the Turkish government troops to strike at the
PKK.
</P>

Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has said that his
government would spare no efforts to eliminate the PKK
guerrillas by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>

SANAA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni voters went to the polls
starting 8 a.m. (local time) today in all Yemeni provinces to
elect their deputies to the new 301-member house of
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni media described popular response to the parliamentary
elections as enthusiastic. About 4.64 million of the country's 16
million population were registered to vote. The registered voters
lined up from day-break in the 301 constituencies which embraced
2,071 election centers manned by some committees throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
The number of Candidates competing for the house stood at
2,311, of whom 754 are party nominees, and 1,557 independent

</P>
<P>
The parliamentary elections are contested by 12 parties for 301

<HEADLINE> "WB Loans to Xiaolangdi Dam Project More Cost-Effective" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank loans used for
part of the Xiaolangdi Dam project have been more fruitful in a
broader sense as they have accelerated China's efforts to get on
the internationally advanced track in terms of managerial system
and concepts."
</P>
<P>
Wang Xianru, director of the Yellow River Water and Hydropower
Development Corporation (YRWHDC), made this remark during an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Hydraulic Project, now under construction on the
Yellow River, near this city in central China's Henan Province, is
the second-largest of its kind in China, only after the gigantic
Three Gorges Hydropower Project on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
According to Zou Yuanqin, chief of the Planning Division, the
Xiaolangdi project plans to use 1.19 billion US dollars of World
Bank loans, including 890 million US dollars in hard loans and 190
million US dollars in export credits for purchase of equipment,
and 110 million US dollars in soft loans for the relocation of
local residents in the project area.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of World Bank loans, about 460 million US
dollars, has been allocated appropriately, and the two sides are
expected to discuss the arrangements for the second group, about
430 million US dollars, in May.
</P>
<P>
As required by the bank, international methods of tendering,
management and supervision have been adopted in the whole process
of the project, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the project has been contracted by three
multinational consortiums, and the Chinese side has learned
advanced experience and technical knowhow regarding management and
technology.
</P>
<P>
"We have repeatedly urged our men to foster their 'sense of
contract', that is, to do everything strictly in line with the
contract," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, Chinese contractors must learn the art of
insisting on compensation for dereliction of contract requirements
and learn to make written reports.
</P>
<P>
He praised foreign companies involved in the project for the
quality and efficiency of their staff and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign managers and technicians have learned from
one another over the past few years of cooperation, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Makes Bid for Becoming Neat, Clean City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
initiated certain steps to ease traffic jam in the crowded capital
city of Dhaka as well as to free it from waterlogging and garbage,
official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
To present the residents with a neat and clean capital city,
the concerned authority has fixed a deadline and sought
cooperation from all sections of people and relevant agencies to
make the bid a success.
</P>
<P>
May 15 is the deadline set by a high-powered coordination
committee meeting recently, which urged the government and private
organizations, hospitals, business establishments and house-owners
to clean their respective premises.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also called upon all to clean ponds, drains and
marshy lands, to remove construction materials from the city roads
and to keep the footpaths free for movement of pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
Several decisions were also taken for reducing traffic jam and
removing waterlogging in this city with a population of over 8
million.
</P>
<P>
The decisions include programs to increase public awareness
about traffic rules, intensifying the construction works of
underpass and box culverts, to construct more overbridges and link
roads on both sides of the railroad passing through Dhaka city.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Dhaka City Corporation will continue its program
throughout the year to kill mosquito larvae in ponds, drains and
other water bodies and marshes so that spread of mosquitoes could
be controlled.

<HEADLINE> Colorful Ceremony Marks Opening of HK's Lantau Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's newest landmark,
the 3.5 kilometer Lantau Link, was officially opened in a colorful
ceremony here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The Link comprises two bridges -- the 2.2 kilometer-long Tsing
Ma Bridge, which is of suspension structure, and the
820-meter-long Kap Shui Mun Bridge, which is cable-stayed -- and
the 503-meter Ma Wan connecting viaduct.
</P>
<P>
The Lantau Link, one of the 10 projects in the 156.4 billion HK
dollars (20 billion U.S. dollars) Hong Kong Airport Core Program,
for the first time links Hong Kong's largest island of Lantau with
Kowloon. It will play a key role in providing road and rail link
to the new airport which, now still under construction, is
scheduled to open in April next year.
</P>
<P>
Throughout its 3.5-kilometer length, the double-deck Lantau
Link has six road lanes on the open upper deck and two road lanes
for use in bad weather, or in an emergency, on the sheltered lower
deck, which will also carry the railway for the new airport.
</P>
<P>
With a main span of 1,377 meters, Tsing Ma is the longest span
suspension road-rail bridge in the world -- more than twice the
length of the Sydney harbor Bridge. Its total length of wire in
the suspension cables measuring at 160,000 kilometers, is enough
to circle the world four times.
</P>
<P>
Its deck is 62 meters above the sea level.
</P>
<P>
Kap Shui Mun, with a main span of 430 meters, is the world's
longest cable-stayed bridge to carry both road and rail traffic.
And its deck is 47 meters above the sea level.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony also featured such activities as a land
parade by community groups representing Hong Kong's 18 districts,
a car procession, a fly-past by airplanes and helicopters, a
flotilla of vessels, lighting up of the Link and a 20-minute
fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the ceremony were more than 1,200 guests
including former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, Hong
Kong Governor Chris Patten, Chief Secretary Mrs. Anson Chan and
representatives from the both sides on the Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group.

<HEADLINE> Canadian PM Expected to Call Election Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien is expected to call a federal election around noon today.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is scheduled to convene a final cabinet meeting in the
morning, which is to be followed by a visit to Governor General
Romeo LeBlanc.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Chretien is expected to formally request
dissolution of Parliament and announce a June 2 election.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls over the past week suggest that Chretien's
Liberal Party enjoy a commanding lead over other parties --
anywhere from 22 to 40 percent points ahead of its nearest
competitor the Progressive Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
That would ordinarily all but guarantee a second, easy majority
victory for the ruling Liberals, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal won a landslide victory in the 1993 federal
election, scooping 177 seats in the then 295-member House of
Commons.

returned home this afternoon from a Gulf tour that took him to
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to discuss the stalled Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The president, accompanied on his tour by several ministers and
aides, made no statement upon his return. He last visited Saudi
Arabia in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
His talks with Saudi King Fahd today dwelt on coordination of
Arab stances in the Mideast peace march and the recent Arab and
Islamic drive to save the process.
</P>
<P>
At the start of his lightning visit, Mubarak stopped in Kuwait
Saturday and held talks with Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah on the setbacks of the Mideast peace. It is his fourth
visit to Kuwait since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said Mubarak's undeclared visit to the two
countries was designed to gain Arab support for an expanded or
mini summit to salvage the peace process from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mubarak said that Egypt was ready to host a
mini-summit grouping Syria, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian
National Authority to restart the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, however, said he opposed holding an Arab summit at
present for fear it could further complicate the peace talks by
taking collective measures against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks ground to a halt last month after Israel
started construction of a new Jewish settlement in disputed Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries decided to freeze all normalization process
with the Jewish state at a foreign ministers' meeting here
afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Sea Access Taking Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIHAI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- With the completion of the
track-laying of the Nanning-Kunming Railway, which links up the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Guizhou and Yunnan provinces,
access to the sea for Southwest China has been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The new access benefits Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan and Hunan
provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as well as
the western part of Guangdong Province, covering nearly one sixth
of China's total 9.6 million sq km and with a total population of
over 200 million.
</P>
<P>
Highways, railways and air routes now link up all parts of the
region, and construction of ports along the coast of the South
China Sea is going full speed ahead. A total of 50 billion yuan
has been invested in such undertakings.
</P>
<P>
The progress has come in the wake of a suggestion by the State
Council in 1992 that access to the sea for the southwest area,
centered around the Nanning-Kunming Railway, should be improved to
promote trade and economic cooperation with Southeast Asia, Hong
Kong and Macao.

<HEADLINE> Authorities to Step up Checks on Value of Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Two government departments plan
to jointly check up on the value of overseas investments in the form
of material objects, in order to prevent the unlawful practices of
overevaluating or underevaluating.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made when officials from the State Bureau of
Commodity Inspection and the General Administration of Customs
met in Jinhua City, in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
According to an official report, in 1996 the commodity
inspection authorities examined 7,568 batches of foreign
investments in kind, which were reportedly valued at a total of
4.27 billion US dollars. But the value went down by 310 million US
dollars after the inspection was made.
</P>
<P>
Last year China's Customs Service collected a total of 85
billion yuan in duty from imports of foreign-invested assets.
But examination resulted in the recovery of another 2.6
billion yuan for the state exchequer.
</P>
<P>
However, the departments said, the inspection covered only a
small proportion of assets related to foreign investments. Last
year a mere 17 percent of the investments in kind -- totaling
24.86 billion US dollars -- were scanned.

SHIJIAZHUANG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
attracted 213 agricultural experts and scholars from seven
countries, including the US, Canada and Japan, last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, 65 foreign agricultural experts visited the
province, which neighbors China's capital of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Such foreign expertise has advanced the local ability to handle
biological disease prevention and treatment, irrigation, fruit
growing and botanical research, and improved the province's
agricultural research level, according to provincial officials.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the province has sent 55 researchers and
managers to 12 countries, including Britain, the US, Canada and
Japan, for scholastic exchange and research purposes.
</P>
<P>
Government efforts have been strengthened to ensure the healthy
development of the cooperation programs. Four projects in a

<HEADLINE> WB-Funded Dam Brings International Expertise to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Xiaolangdi Dam being built on
the Yellow River, the second-largest river in China, will not only
give China a multipurpose dam, it will give it a scenic reservoir
with tourism potential, and greater ability to control the
turbulent Yellow River and irrigate a larger area of farmland.
</P>
<P>
It will also facilitate training a contingent of Chinese
managerial and technical personnel with expertise learned from
hundreds of foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xianru, deputy director of the Yellow River Water and
Hydropower Development Corporation (YRWHDC), told Xinhua that the
project plans to introduce over one billion US dollars in loans
from the World Bank, which will make it rank the first among all
Chinese projects in terms of the amount borrowed from the
international financial institution.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is reckoned to be particularly challenging
in engineering terms, is considered to be the best place for
training Chinese managerial and technical personnel for water
projects in an international environment, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese managers and technicians can learn a lot from the World
Bank officials who visit the site twice a year, Canadian
consultants who are assigned to the site to supervise the project
operation and hundreds of foreign experts from over 50 countries,
who include representatives of foreign contractors, and managerial
and technical staff employed by the contractors, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
According to Cui Xuewen, director of the company's personnel
division, since the project was formally launched in 1993 a
series of training courses on project supervision and the English
language have been held, with the number of trainees exceeding
500. Meanwhile, over 800 students of hydrology have been trained
there.
</P>
<P>
To further improve the expertise of Chinese managers the
corporation has sent 89 people to be trained abroad, and 11 have
been sent to study the International Engineering Management
Speciality at Tianjin University, Cui added.
</P>
<P>
Cui said the corporation has drawn up a plan this year to
train 180 medium- and high-level managerial experts in the coming
five years, and to invest one million yuan for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Huanzhang, director of the company's publicity
division, 70 percent of the 200-plus staff in the corporation have
a higher-education background.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Teachers Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen have
attacked and opened fire on a mini-bus transporting Egyptian
teachers and local staff members in north Mogadishu this morning.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place near Rowda mosque of Shibbis district
where the Egyptians live and they were heading to the school of
Majma Umul Qura of north Mogadishu where they teach.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitness accounts, the gunmen about five armed
with assault rifles were driving a taxi and opened fire as they
came round the corner on the bus carrying about seven Egyptian
teachers and two security guards and a driver. The incident which
seemed to have been precalculated has left the two security
guards and the driver get seriously wounded following the return
of fire by the security guards.
</P>
<P>
With little hope, the two security men and the driver were
rushed to Keysaney hospital for treatment. Also one of the
Egyptian teachers has suffered slight shrapnel injuries on his
right arm during the exchange of fire. The gunmen have escaped
unhurt after the neighbors of the area have come out to help.
</P>
<P>
The shocked Egyptian teachers have come out of the vehicle
bewildered. However, the man who sustained the slight injury on
his right arm using a lemon to stop the bleeding said they will
not be discouraged by the incident and therefore will further
continue their job which he characterized as holy effort.
</P>
<P>
According to the eyewitness, the perpetrators who probably
aimed at hijacking the mini-bus have managed to confiscate the
two guns used by the body guards of the Egyptian teachers, but
failed to take away the vehicle itself. There has been no
official word from the local authority of Shibbis district yet,
however a number of armed militiamen from the Islamic court were
seen patrolling the area in an attempt to locate the culprits.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian teachers teach at the only elementary and
intermediat e school where few thousand students from both sides
of the capital attend. The school, Majma Umul Qura is funded by
the government of Saudi Arabia. However the students pay each 1.5
to 3 US dollars per month which is used for the sanitation and
watchmen of the school.
</P>
<P>
A similar school is being run by Egyptian teachers in the
central town of Beletuein where more than 5000 students attend
their intermediate classes. One more school is also being taught
by the Egyptians in Qardo district of northeastern region
controlled by the SSDF faction. Since the collapse of the former
regime, the regular system of education has also collapsed, but
still some elementary and intermediate schools are being run by
Muslim and Arab agencies country wide.

<HEADLINE> PICC Life Boosts Sales Through Individual Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- PICC Life, a subsidiary of
China's biggest insurer, the People's Insurance Company of
China (PICC), expects a sharp growth of sales by its 80,000
individual agents this year -- topping five billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
PICC Life is now the country's largest life insurance
company. It was reshaped into a limited-liability company from a
former life insurance department of the PICC last year. The
company now has a team of almost 80,000 individual sales agents,
40,000 regular employees and about 3,000 branches nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yaohua, vice-president of PICC Life, said the company is
expected to overtake the Ping An Insurance Co. Ltd in sales by
individual agents within this year. Ping An has led home insurers
in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
Ping An, headquartered in Shenzhen, was the first Chinese
insurer to introduce the individual sales agent system to boost
its urban sales.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year the total sales of PICC life
reached 7.8 billion yuan-worth, an increase of 107 percent over
the figure for the same period of last year, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company's total spending on business expansion
has been slashed by two percentage points, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the company's statistics, PICC life had a total of
300 million insurance policies that were still valid at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Insurance specialists say that the rapid growth of China's
economy and that of the annual income of Chinese residents will
expand the insurance market.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the total premium income in China's life
insurance business will reach around 120 billion yuan by the end of
this century.

<HEADLINE> Zoo Keepers Look for Father of Panda Cub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Zoo keepers in the Chinese
capital are still unsure which giant panda is the father of a baby
panda, even though the cub is now more than six months old.
</P>
<P>
They said that there are "three possible fathers".
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for us to make it clear, because the mother
panda, 'Le Le', mated with two male pandas and was artificially
inseminated before she gave birth to the baby," explained Zong
Ying, director of the Beijing Zoo.
</P>
<P>
"If we know exactly which one is the cub's real father we can
avoid inbreeding among pandas in future, and the quality of panda
reproduction will be improved," said Wang Changhai, a panda raiser
at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the most endangered species on
earth. There are only some 1,000 pandas, most of them living in
west China's Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
A mature female panda can become pregnant once a year if she
can successfully mate with a male panda during the
three-to-five-day oestrus period, and can produce one or two
babies.
</P>
<P>
However, the rate of successful breeding remains fairly low and
depends largely on artificial insemination, the technique of which
has become well developed in China.
</P>
<P>
"Le Le" gave birth to two cubs on October 4 last year, but
only one cub survived.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Atop Mubarak Gulf Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The stalemated Middle East peace
process tops the agenda of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's tour
of three Gulf countries, a Kuwaiti official told the Egyptian
Voice of Arab radio today.
</P>
<P>
Suleyman Majid Al Shaheen, Kuwaiti Foreign Undersecretary,
said that Mubarak, accompanied by several ministers and aides,
held brief talks Saturday with Kuwait's Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah on the setbacks in the Mideast peace march.
</P>
<P>
It was Mubarak's fourth visit to Kuwait since the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak started his three-nation Gulf tour Saturday which has
already taken him to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. He is scheduled to
visit the United Arab Emirates later today.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who is accompanying the
president, said Saturday that the current tour is "the beginning
of other Arab contacts and tours to coordinate stances with
regard to the circumstances the Middle East area is passing
through."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif said Mubarak's
visit took place against the backdrop of the vacillating situation
in the Middle East, which called for consultations among the Arab
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks groundded to a halt last month after Israel
started construction of a new Jewish settlement on Har Home in
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mubarak told Egyptian television that he opposed
holding an Arab summit at present for fear it could further
complicate the peace talks by taking collective measures against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Egypt was ready to host a summit meeting among Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein if Israel could
stop building settlements on occupied Arab lands, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's renewed diplomatic drive came a day after the U.N.
General Assembly voted 134-3 to demand an immediate halt to the
Har Homa housing project and an end to all forms of support for
Israel's settlement activities.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Plant Five Million Hectares of Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to plant five million
more hectares of forests in the next 14 years, raising the
nation's forest coverage from the current 28 percent of land area
to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
The afforestation acreage is to include 1.6 million hactares of
specialized forests to provide materials for the paper industry,
350,000 hactares of forests for furniture-making and 450,000
hactares of forests for construction timber.
</P>
<P>
It will also include 300,000 hactares of precious timber
forests and 1.7 million hactares of watershed protective
forests. In addition, some 500 million scattered trees will be
planted annually.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost an estimated 2.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Forests in Vietnam are now shrinking, both in acreage and
quality, due to unplanned exploitation and annual fires, seriously
affecting the national protection capacity and the environment.
</P>
<P>
The country now has only 9.3 million hactares of forests which
are concentrated in 35 of the country's 61 provinces and cities,
as compared to 14 million hactares in 1943.
</P>
<P>
However, this is an improvement from the 8.2 million hactares
of forests in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia's Election Campaign Kicks Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's three political
parties -- the ruling party Golkar, the United Development Party
(PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) -- today began
their election campaigns in different areas throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
Massive gatherings of thousands of yelling, drum-beating and
horn-whistling political supporters became the main
characteristics of the 27-day nation-wide campaign which will run
until May 23.
</P>
<P>
During the campaigning, the three contenders will try to
attract as many as 124 million registered voters in the general
election scheduled for May 29.
</P>
<P>
The three contestants will also campaign through the
state-owned television and radio stations. The 30-minute
pre-recorded speeches will be aired and relayed by the five
private television stations and radio stations across the country,
every day starting 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The General Election Institute has introduced the zoning system
in this year's election, the seventh held since independence. Each
political party is obliged to conduct its campaign in two
specially designed regions each day.
</P>
<P>
The regulation divides the country into six campaign regions:
Region I is for provinces in Sumatra; Region II for provinces in
Java; Region III fro provinces in Bali, West and East Nusa
Tenggara and East Timor; Region IV for provinces in Kalimantan;
Region V for provinces in Sulawesi; And Region VI for the
provinces of Maluku and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
Under Indonesia's current rules of campaigning, no political
party is allowed to question the state ideology, Pancasila, nor
the 1945 constitution, nor to damage another parties' reputation.
</P>
<P>
A party is allowed to promote its programs in connection with
national development. It could say good things about itself, but
it is forbidden to say anything bad about the government, its
policies or its officials.
</P>
<P>
The government also banned motor parades and marches during the
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
Golkar, which hopes to win 350 seats, or 70 percent of the
500-seat House of Representatives (DPR) during the election, today
started its campaign in Java, Maluku and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Jakarta, the atmosphere was heating as
ten massive gatherings were held in five districts of the city,
but the situation was firmly controlled and there was no report of
any incidents till now.
</P>
<P>
The two minority parties -- PPP and PDI began their campaign
separately in other areas out of Java.
</P>
<P>
PPP's Chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum started his campaign this
morning in Medan, North Sumatra. He said his party will fight for
democratization, social justice and rights.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Chairman Karmoko started his campaign in Lebak regency,
West Java, in the morning, and in the afternoon, he arrived in
Jakarta with several prominent Golkar members including cabinet
ministers to continue his campaign.
</P>
<P>
PDI's Chairman Soerjadi, who made a speech on the radio this
morning, campaigned in Pontianak, West Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
All the three parties are currently eyeing the 425 available
seats in DPR. Under Indonesia's political system, the DPR has 500
seats in which 75 are observed for the Armed Forces (ABRI) whose
members do not vote. ABRI's number of seats have been reduced by
25 in comparison to the 1992 general election.
</P>
<P>
All the three contestants, which had filed a total of 2,285 DPR
candidates, are mainly eyeing votes in Java, Indonesia's most
crowded island. Java houses 70 percent of the registered voters.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 general election, the ruling Golkar lost 17 seats,
most of them in Java. The party is now struggling to regain the 17
seats it lost.

<HEADLINE> Iran Has No Expectation from EU: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran has no any expectation
from the European Union (EU) countries and they can do whatever they
like, Iranian foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Velayati said that Iran wants to have
good relations with European countries "but what is more important
for us is the observance of our principles in the foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister made the statement on the eve the
ministerial meeting of the European Union member nations,
scheduled to be held in Brussels on April 29.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question raised by Xinhua, Velayati said that "our
foreign relations is (are) not limited to our relations with
European countries."
</P>
<P>
He said: "We can procure our needs from different countries
and sell them too. We have a vast network of ties with 140
other countries. We also have 136 embassies and councillor
offices."
</P>
<P>
"We have good relations with many countries such as China,
Russia, Southeast Asia, Japan, Canada and others," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Iran welcomes the initiative of good ties
by all countries, including EU, so long as they are based on
mutual respect and interest.
</P>
<P>
The April 10 Berlin court verdict, which implicated top
Iranian leaders with an assassination of four Kurdish opposition
leaders in Mykonos restaurant in Berlin five years ago, sparked a
fierce diplomatic battle between Iran and Germany. About 400
extremist Muslim students even threatened to seize the Germany
Embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had recalled their ambassadors and expelled
four diplomats each other. All EU member countries, except
Greece, have recalled their ambassadors in protest against the
alleged involvement of Iranian leaders in the Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
All foreign ministers of EU member countries are going to
meet and iron out a joint and unified policy toward Iran at
the ministerial meeting to be held Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said "our relations with other
countries are based on mutual respect and mutual interest. We
don't agree with unilateral relations. We believe in this very
important principle as mentioned in the Vienna Convention."
</P>
<P>
"That means absence of the interference in the internal
affairs of each other. We know that the dual containment
policy which was imposed on us by the Americans is now
defeated," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The foreign exchange reserve of
Kazakhstan has dropped 3.6 billion tenge (47.5 million U.S.
dollars), or 3.6 percent, to 98.4 billion tenge (1.3 billion
dollars) over the first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Alievich Djandosov, president of the central bank of
Kazakhstan, attributed the fall mainly to the devaluation of gold
in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The slide of the gold price has caused a loss of 2 billion
tenge (27.2 million dollars) to Kazakhstan's foreign exchange
reserve, said Djandosov.
</P>
<P>
The president said the country's main tasks for this year, set
in the 1996-1998 economic program, will be to curb inflation and
stablize the value of tenge.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia, Ukraine and Belarus today
marked the 11th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear accident, the
worst nuclear disaster in the world.
</P>
<P>
April 26 is "a day of great grief for mankind," said Yeltsin in

buried.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Ukraine, hundreds of workers at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant stood in silence at noon today to remember
those who died in the accident, while thousands gathered in the
capital of Kiev for ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
In Belarus, downwind from Chernobyl, about 20,000 people

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Ends Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak concluded a visit to Saudi Arabia today after holding
talks with Saudi King Fahd on the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwait News Agency reports from Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia, Mubarak's talks with Fahd also covered bilateral
relations and the latest Arab and International developments.
</P>
<P>
The visit came within the framework of consultations between
the leaders of the two countries to map out an Arab position in
times of crisis, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak, who last visited the Kingdom in August 1996,
was accompanied by foreign and information ministers and other
top government officials.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving in Jiddah, Mubarak stopped in Kuwait and held
talks with Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said Mubarak's undeclared visit to Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia was aimed to discuss the Arab developments,
especially the stalemated Middle East Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
His tour was designed to gain Arab support for an expanded or
mini summit to salvage the peace process from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mubarak said that he was ready to hold a mini-summit
grouping Syria, Jordan, the Palestinian National Authority and
Egypt to work out a stance parallel to the Israeli initiative to
promote peace.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, however, said a pan-Arab summit was not appropriate
for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Israel's continued moves with the construction of a new Jewish
settlement in Har Homa in East Jerusalem last month brought
the Middle East peace process to a standstill and triggered Arab
and world anger.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries decided to freeze all normalization
process with the Jewish state in a foreign ministers' meeting
in Cairo afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Company Develops New Tomato Seeds Extractor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli company has
developed a new tomato seeds extractor the TS-1000, it was learned
from the Israel Export Institute.
</P>
<P>
In a traditional way, fermentation tanks are used to strip
tomato seeds of their membranes before drying. It not only
takes up space, but uses approximately 10 cubic meters of
water per one kilogram of clean seeds for the cleansing process.
</P>
<P>
The new machine, TS-1000, developed by a Kiryat Weizmann Science
Park incubator company Inter-Nevet Ltd. (U.S. patent pending) use
only 2 cubic meters of water and instead of 1-2 days, purifies
tomatoes almost instantly at rates of two to three kilograms of
seeds per hour.
</P>
<P>
Weighing 200 kilograms, the TS-1000 is easily transportable, so
tomatoes can be processed in the fields.
</P>
<P>
The seed extraction process is also highly controllable,
allowing factors such as temperature, humidity and speed to be
adjusted.
</P>
<P>
A protype has already been developed and tested, and
further tests are under way. In tests by Israel's largest seed
producer Hazera, the TS-1000 seeds proved high germination rates
compared to seeds produced through standard fermentation methods.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Starts Navy Exercises with Allies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait started a three-day
joint naval exercises with the U.S., British and French warships
today in a bid to coordinate team work against any possible threat.
</P>
<P>
The war games code-named "Eager Sentry" is being participated
by the Kuwaiti warship Al-Sanbouk, USS Ingram, USS Ardent, the
British missile destroyer HMS Southampton and French frigate
George Legues.
</P>
<P>
The main goal of the exercise was to "advance relationships
and increase the interoperability of the Western Navies with
the Gulf state by exercising in an environment of all the
threats we can possibly think off," Southanmpton commanding
officer Duncan Potts said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ships participating in the exercises will sail off in
a simulated mine field transit, and during the three days at
sea, the ships will do anti-surface ship exercises with
Kuwaiti naval patrol boats simulating the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Air defense and live surface firing in an area just off
Kuwait will also be conducted during the exercises course.

of military exercises since the Gulf War within the framework
of military cooperation agreements signed with them.

<HEADLINE> New Therapy for Diabetics with Gangrene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Diabetics whose blood
circulation is so poor that their feet develop gangrene and
osteomyelitis and who consequently face limb amputation, can be
helped by fly maggots that eat away necrotic tissue, allowing
new layers of healthy tissue to cover the wound.
</P>
<P>
This unaesthetic but potentially successful therapy offered to
patients at Israel's Hadassah-University Hospital in Jerusalem
by parasitologists at the affiliated Hebrew University Hadassah
Medical School, was reported on the latest issue of Harefuah, a
journal of the Israel Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
The team, headed by parasite expert Kosta Muncuoglu, provided
doctors with larvae of the sheep blowfly, Phoenicia Sericata,
for treatment of five elderly diabetic patients whose gangrene
had not improved with antibiotic therapy.
</P>
<P>
Despite severe pain and the danger of blood poisoning, the
patients refused to have their limbs amputated, then they
nevertheless agreed to undergo maggot therapy twice a week.
</P>
<P>
Sterile larvae were applied to the wound and replaced about
twice a week, and in the most seriously affected patient, the
blackened, necrotic tissue around the toes and on the soles of
the feet detached from the healthy tissues at the end of four
months.
</P>
<P>
During the last three months, the maggots had removed the
remaining infected tissue and the pain disappeared, as the
patient was able to walk without discomfort.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the other patients, who had relatively superficial
gangrene, completed their therapy in a month.
</P>
<P>
The idea of using maggots to remove gangrenous tissue did not
originate at Hadassah, and the possibility was first observed by
Napoleon's chief military physician and than later by the chief
medical officer in the United States Civil War.
</P>
<P>
It was used until the 1950s, but when antibiotics and
surgical techniques became available, the use of fly larvae was
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
With the development of bacterial strains resistant to
antibiotics, doctors thought of returning to the parasitic
technique, but only those patients who did not respond to any
other therapy.
</P>
<P>
It can also be used for burns, scores, chronic bone infection
and pus-filled boils.
</P>
<P>
The main shortcomings of using maggots are the psychological
and aesthetic problems of patients feeling they are being "eaten
alive" by parasites, but the larvae's freedom of action is
limited by bandages, and medications reduce the itching of the
bite.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders probe of Alleged Abduction of Fisherman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today ordered cabinet members to look into and take appropriate
actions on the alleged abduction of Filipino fishermen by
Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the presidential office said
Ramos has asked Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, Defense
Secretary Renato de Villa, and Interior Secretary Robert Barbers
to submit a process report not later than Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The office said that on April 14, Malaysian natives at Barque
Island complained of being robbed of three motorboat engines,
cash, and valuables by Filipino pirates.
</P>
<P>
On that day, it said, an undetermined number of Malaysians,
aboard a vessel that "closely resembled the Malaysian naval patrol
craft," entered Philippine waters and docked at Mangsee Island,
Balabac, Palawan Province.
</P>
<P>
On the following day, the intruders rounded up several
residents in the islet and forced seven fishermen, including a
10-year-old boy, to board their own five motorboats, the office
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Malaysians then tied these motorboats in a row and towed
them to Malaysian waters," it said.
</P>
<P>
The abducted Filipino fishermen are now detained by Malaysian
authorities at Kudat, Malaysia, and are being forced to confess to
the robbery, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The office quoted Palawan police and military authorities as
saying that the Malaysians bagged the wrong guys, adding that the
Filipino pirates who raided Barque Island were residents of nearby
Barangay Indalawan, also in Balabac, Palawan.

It was also reported that a statement from the State House of
Gabon said that Mobutu would like to go to Gabon at any time to meet

114-113.
</P>
<P>

<P>
DHAKA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) Khaleda Zia said there could be dialogue
on national core issues with the government if the administration
showed good intentions and created a proper environment for that.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia, whose party was defeated in last June's elections,
said the BNP wanted an immediate end to "persecution" on the
opposition so that "we can rightfully and without any fear
discharge our duties as a responsible and the biggest-ever
opposition in the parliament."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Bangladesh on Saturday, the opposition leader said they would not
pursue any policy which would create obstacles in the way of
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the government's recent call for a dialogue on
key national issues, the former prime minister said her party
wanted to ensure political stability but the main responsibility
rested with the government.
</P>

She alleged that more than 150 BNP leaders and workers had been
killed in the last 10 months, and nearly 4,000 people detained
during the last nine months under the special powers act.
</P>
<P>
"At least for the sake of our future generation, let us hope
the present government would get above the politics of emotions
and rhetoric, politics of persecution and harassment and politics
of money and violence," she said.

Question: After 1997, can judicial organs in Hong Kong
establish juridical relations with their inland counterparts?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The relationship between Hong Kong and inland judicial
organs will be one of non-subordination and
co-operation. According to Article 95 of the Basic Law, the Hong
Kong SAR may, through consultations and in accordance with law,
maintain juridical relations with judicial organs of other parts
of the country; and they may render assistance to each
other. Needless to say, all these procedures must be conducted in
accordance with law.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded Michael Chang
rallied to beat Australian Jason Stoltenberg for a final berth in
the US Men's Clay Court Championships in Florida on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With a win of 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, Chang will face South African
Grant Stafford in the final, who downed sixth-seeded American
Chris Woodruff 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Chang had a slow start against Stoltenberg. After taking a 2-0
lead, the American twice lost his serve as Stoltenberg rolled to a
5-4 lead and held his serve to take the first set.
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg, two years senior than Chang, broke Chang in the
third game for a 3-1 lead in the second set before Chang completed
a sweep of the succeeding five games.
</P>
<P>
In the decider, Chang sailed further with ease with his
trademark of baseline strokes.
</P>
<P>
The win was Chang's 20th in his last 21 matches and brought his
record for the year to 27-3.
</P>
<P>
Against Stafford he'll be trying for an ATP Tour-leading fourth
title of the year and the 30th tournament victory of his career.

<HEADLINE> Russia Seeks Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia will try its best to get
the membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) as early as
possible, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for talks with G-7 officials in Washington,
Chubais told reporters that there exist some economic and
political obstacles standing in the way of Russia's entry into the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to join the WTO, Russia must discuss with other
countries the adjustment of tariffs and economic regulation, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some other countries' experiences showed that
political factors could be used for preventing a country from
entering the WTO, he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Russia began to apply for the membership of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the predecessor of
the WTO. Negotiations have entered a substantially critical stage
this year.
</P>
<P>
Chubais said that in the process of the negotiations, Russia
must maintain the current scale of its foreign trade and not lose
"a single rouble or U.S. dollar."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia does not want to see the negotiations
dragging on for seven or eight years, he added.

<HEADLINE> Five Get Jail Terms For Cheating Banks of Billions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Five men, two Japanese, two
from Taiwan and one Singaporean, who tried to cheat three foreign
banks here of billions of dollars in two months, had received jail
terms ranging between four and five years, the Sunday Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The five had conspired with Sadako Okada, an elderly Japanese
woman who self-claimed to be the illegitimate daughter of the late
Japanese Emperor Hirohito.
</P>
<P>
Between January and February last year, they tried to open
accounts at three foreign banks here with a forged Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank draft worth 1.27 trillion Japanese yen, amounting to more
than 9.7 billion US dollars at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The banks targeted by the group were the Republic National Bank
of New York, American Express Bank, and the Union Bank of
Switzerland. When they met the officers of the banks, they
introduced Okada as a Japanese royal to facilitate the cashing of
the bank draft.
</P>
<P>
However, the extraordinarily large amount made the banks
suspicious. After their own checks, the banks discovered that the
bank draft was forged. They then reported to the authorities and
the Commercial Affairs Department of Singapore arrested all six
members of the group at one of the banks in March last year.
</P>
<P>
Last August, District Judge Jasvender Kaur of Singapore sent
Okada to jail for one and a half years. But the Japanese woman
died of natural causes on March 11 this year, two days before she
was due to be released from the Changi Women's Prison.
</P>
<P>
After a 53-day hearing, District Judge Rahim Jalil found all
five men guilty on Saturday and he sentenced the two from Taiwan
to four years and a half in jail each on two charges of conspiring
to cheat. The two Japanese men were jailed for four years each on
two conspiracy charges of abetting Okada, while the Singaporean, a
bankrupt, received the heaviest sentence of five years' jail on
two charges of conspiring to cheat.

</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index rose by 103.27 points to 3,799.79 on
Monday and moved further upwards to close the week at 3,825.57 as
against the last weekend close of 3696.52, showing a net gain of
129.05 points.
</P>
<P>
The national index also shot up by 47.86 points to 1,637.94 at
the weekend from 1,590.08 in the previous weekend.

<P>
The BSE-200 and the US dollar index were quoted up at 364.77
and 169.88 at the close of the week compared with the last
Thursday's close of 354.74 and 164.97 respectively.

181.50 and MTNL by 17.75 to 292.75.
</P>
<P>
Strongly aided by hopes of political stability with the
assumption of office by the United Front government under new
prime minister I.K. Gujral which would facilitate the smooth
passage of the finance bill and the market-friendly budget for
1997-98 in the parliament session beginning from April 30, the
market sentiment generally remained firm on persistent buying
support from foreign institutional investors and bull operators.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's assurance that the economic reforms would
continue irrespective of political uncertainties provided fresh
impetus to the market.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Confident in Italy's Joining Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
today reaffirmed his confidence that Italy will join the launch of
the European single currency, the Euro, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Despite figures published in mid-week by the EU commission
suggesting that Italy might not qualify for joining the Euro,
Prodi declared in a newspaper interview, "We will succeed in
entering the Euro."
</P>
<P>
The EU commission put Italy's budget deficit for this year at
3.2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), which was 0.2
percent above the ceiling set in the Maastricht Treaty for the
entry of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Calling the EU commission's figure "technically unjustified",
Prodi said, "I cannot understand why the European Commission gave
us a ratio of deficit of GDP of 3.2 percent while others gave us
three percent."
</P>
<P>
Forecasts from the International Monetary Fund and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development had
suggested that Italy would qualify for the Euro Launch.
</P>
<P>
The EU is targeting to launch the Euro by January 1, 1999. But
scepticism is growing over whether the deadline can be met as few
members have been able to fulfill the criteria set by the
Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
On the achievements of his 11-month administration, Prodi said,
"I would like to know what other countries have succeeded in
achieving an improvement like ours."
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that Italy had to overcome a reputation
for economic unreliability.
</P>
<P>
On future structural reforms of the pension and welfare systems
which his government is aiming to achieve this year, Prodi noted,
"I have no intention of dismantling the welfare system."
</P>
<P>
He also rejected proposals raised by the center-right
opposition to form a broadly based coalition to take Italy into
the European Economic and Monetary Union.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Support Myanmar's ASEAN Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite U.S. pressure to delay
admitting Myanmar into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), Thailand will not be swayed, according to a Thai
government deputy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Tinakorn Kanasuta, deputy government spokesman for foreign
affairs, said on Saturday that Thailand will adhere to its
position to support Myanmar in becoming a member of ASEAN, because
the grouping has already made the decision.
</P>
<P>
At both the fifth ASEAN summit in Bangkok in 1995 and the
informal ASEAN summit in Jakarta in 1996, Thailand agreed in
principle to support Myanmar's entry as a full member of the
grouping, Tinakorn said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has decided that the three observer nations -- Cambodia,
Laos and Myanmar -- will join ASEAN together, and ASEAN foreign
ministers are scheduled to meet in late May in Malaysia to
consider if the three are all ready to join and a formal decision
is to be made in July.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said
the U.S. was trying to persuade ASEAN to reject Myanmar's bid to
become a full member on the grounds of its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Amnaj Chananwongse, another deputy spokesman for the
Thai government, insisted that Thailand has a "strong policy of
non-interference in the internal affairs of its neighboring
countries," adding that "Thailand must always be careful and
sincere in its relations" with its neighbors.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Russian presidential press
office today spoke highly of the results achieved by Russia and
China during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's five-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
The office said in a statement, released prior to the
conclusion of Jiang's visit which ended today, that "the
Sino-Russian relations is playing a positive role in safeguarding
stability in the world and has become a model for state-to-state
ties after the Cold War."
</P>
<P>
The office highly praised the Sino-Russian Joint Statement on
Multipolarization of the World and the Establishment of New
International Order, signed by Jiang and his Russian counterpart
Boris Yeltsin on April 23.
</P>
<P>
"As the 21st century is approaching, the joint statement
expounded the common views of the two countries on the world
situation and the principles of developing partnership between the
two countries as both Russia and China should play a more active
role in international affairs," it said.
</P>
<P>
With joint efforts, hope emerged for border demarcation between
the two countries and this would be an essential prerequisite for
establishing a peaceful and cooperative zone in the border areas,
it said.
</P>
<P>
During the high-level meetings, the leaders of the two
countries agreed to try their best to complete the demarcation of
the eastern part of the borderline by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The office also welcomed the agreement on mutual reduction of
military forces in border areas signed Thursday by Jiang and his
counterparts of Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

<HEADLINE> China's Military Firms Targeting Development Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 80 military enterprises
signed 75 contracts worth 759 million yuan with more than 40
developments zones at a national fair last week.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on future cooperation are continuing, according to
Zhao Yundong, chairman of the China Association of Development
Zones.
</P>
<P>
The military enterprises' cutting edge lies in its relatively
advanced technology, better-educated personnel and more fixed
assets. The development zones have advantages in capital,
information, industry structure and geographical location, Zhao
was quoted by today's China Daily as analyzing.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the beginning of the 1980s, many military
enterprises, most of which are engaged in heavy industries, have
shifted their production focus to products for civilian purposes.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest color television producer, Changhong
Television Factory, is an example of success.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 15,000 products for civilian purposes
account for 80 percent of all the military enterprises' total
output value.

<HEADLINE> China's Entry to WTO to Help Market Share of Import Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Market share of import
automobiles may rise again next year in China as the central
government is about to solve hurdles that have caused the slump in
demand, said an article in today's "China Daily Business Weekly".
</P>
<P>
China's probable entry into the World Trade Organization (WHO)
is also expected to improve the situation, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Hit by restricted demand, high tariffs and growing domestic
production, the share of imported automobiles has slumped to the
lowest level since the People's Republic of China was founded in
1949.
</P>
<P>
The market share of car imports this year may be lower than
last year's 14 percent, compared with an average of 48 percent
between 1991 and 1996, 61 percent in the 1980s, 38 percent in the
1960s and 1970s, and 82 percent in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
However, the needs among China's car buyers are widening, and
this is likely to increase demand for imported models, especially
in the coastal booming areas, said Chen Ping, vice-president of
the China Trading Center of Imported Automobiles, the country's
largest auto distribution network.
</P>
<P>
Chinese as well as foreign automotive executives said they
expect individuals' buying of cars in the country will further
increase as their incomes grow and the desire for efficiency is
amplifying.
</P>
<P>
More and more Chinese automotive experts are admitting that the
relatively slack domestic markets is in many ways due to high
costs and unsatisfactory quality.
</P>
<P>
Expecting more vehicles imports after China enters WTO, the
domestic industry is stepping up efforts to improve product
quality and variety, the article said.

<HEADLINE> Party Mulls Return to India's UF Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The mood in the Tamil Maanila
Congress (TMC), a constituent of the ruling 13-party United Front
(UF), seems to favor the party's return to the government.
</P>
<P>
The TMC decided not to join the government headed by new Prime
Minister I.K. Gujral following squabbles with some UF members and
after being denied candidacy of the premiership to replace the
outgoing Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
Senior UF leaders, including Gujral himself, have tried their
best to bring back the TMC to the government.
</P>
<P>
The TMC's executive members are meeting today in Chennai,
capital of Tamil Nadu, to discuss and decide whether the party
should join the Gujral government.
</P>
<P>
TMC chief G.K. Moopanar has met party leaders and workers at
the party's headquarters and was told that the party should get
back into the government. The dominant view in the TMC is that the
party would not stand to gain politically by staying out of the
government when it is part of the UF.
</P>
<P>
Since arrival in Tamil Nadu on Friday after a long stay in New
Delhi, Moopanar has been appealing to TMC workers to avoid
criticizing any political party for not selecting him as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The left parties within the UF were reported to have played an
important role in preventing him from becoming prime minister for
his close relations with the Congress party and Sonia Gandhi,
widow of former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. Moopanar broke
with the Congress last year and formed his own party of TMC.

SHENZHEN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Courts at various levels in
Shenzhen, a special economic zone in Guangdong Province, dealt

<HEADLINE> Fujian to Open More Drug Rehabilitation Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Police officials in east China's
Fujian Province plan to set up drug rehabilitation centers in the
province's leading cities next year in an attempt to help addicts
kick their habit.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has ordered local police departments
in Fuzhou, which is Fujian's capital, Xiamen, Quanzhou and
Zhangzhou to open rehab centers before September.
</P>
<P>
Next year, such centers are to be established in Putian, Ningde
and Sanming cities, and also in other small cities and counties
which have a certain number of drug addicts, according to the
government order.
</P>
<P>
Local judicial departments will also be responsible for
establishing court-ordered rehab centers for drug users, who have
been put into reeducation-through-labor camps to be cured of their
addiction.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen, Fujian's economically-developed city, will open such a
center this year.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government also asked the Provincial Department
of Health and the Provincial Office of Narcotics Control to
examine voluntary rehab centers opened by hospitals and other
medical institutes.
</P>
<P>
Individuals are not allowed to provide rehabilitation service
and sell medicine used for detoxification.
</P>
<P>
Fujian currently has only three rehab centers, in Fuzhou,
Xiamen and Fuqing, which have offered rehabilitation service to
more than 3,800 substance abusers.
</P>
<P>
However, the province has been in great need of such facilities
with the rapid rise in drug users in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The number of drug addicts registered in government
institutions in the province has soared from 180 people in 1991 to
the current 4,000.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's decision is part of China's newest massive anti-drug
fight which is planned to last until September.
</P>
<P>
China currently reports a total of 520,000 drug addicts. Some
600 rehabilitation centers have been established across the
country.

<HEADLINE> Official Calls for Enterprise Merger in Light Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's light industry should
improve its structure and become more competitive by merging large
enterprises and annexing weak ones, said a senior light industry
official.
</P>
<P>
The effort can help eliminate unnecessary construction and
establish an economy of scale in the industry, Hu Nan, director
general of the National Council of Light Industry's planning and
development department, was quoted by today's "China Daily" as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Light industry will give priority to leading companies in
various industrial sectors, provide financial support and
encourage them to annex inferior companies, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
It also will apply for state approval so more large enterprises
will be able to finance and float bonds and stocks, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
By merging large enterprises and annexing small and less
competitive companies, light industry is expected to create 100
large enterprise groups with more than two billion yuan (240
million US dollars) annual sales by 2000.
</P>
<P>
China's light industry has long been plagued with a poor
structure: construction of similar projects and wasting resources
because of low manufacturing technology.
</P>
<P>
For example, air conditioning companies used 33 percent of
their capacity in 1995. Plastics firms used 40.6 percent and
washing machine makers used 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
Light industry is directly related to daily life and is
basically a processing industry. So many companies have blindly
invested in low technology projects without considering the whole
market and existing production capacity, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The problem is particularly serious for breweries, leather
makers, paper mills and household ceramic makers.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Equipment to Dominate Major Power Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- New power plants in China would
no longer use foreign 300,000- and 350,000-kw generators, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
China should develop its power industry on the basis of
domestic products and imports should be supplementary, China Daily
quoted Power Industry Minister Shi Dazhen as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, China may have to continue to import one million-kw
generators, for the country is unable to build such big machines,
Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders said 40 percent of the machine-building
industry's capacity for building major generators is idle because
of imports.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are optimistic about Chinese machinery because the
country's decision to withdraw preferential treatment for imported
equipment would prevent the import of too many major foreign
machines.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's 235 million-kw generating capacity, 80 percent
comes from domestically produced equipment. Of 300,000-kw or
higher generators, 50 percent were domestic products.

CAIRO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Morocco scored a 1-0 victory over
Sierra Leone in Freetown on Saturday, moving closer towards a
berth in the 1998 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The sole goal was netted by Bassir Salaheddine in the 40th
minute after taking advantage of a midfield blunder of Sierra
Leone defender Mohammed Kanu.
</P>
<P>
The win put Morocco (2-1-0) three points ahead of Sierra Leone
(1-1-2) with a game in hand in Africa's Group 5.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Morocco was still awaiting a FIFA review of its
April 6 match against Gabon in Libreville, which Morocco led 4-0
before it was abandoned in the 55th minute due to fan riots.
</P>
<P>
If FIFA allows the result to stand, Morocco would move six
points of Sierra Leone with only two matches remaining.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's chances for an equaliser was ruled out in the
77th minute when its keeper Brima Attouga Kamara was fished out of
the pitch for an intentional handball outside the penalty area.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Farmers Enjoy Good Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in east China's Jiangsu
Province enjoy the best health conditions among Chinese farmers, with
an average life expectancy of 71 years, double the figure soon
after the founding of new China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Other major health indices for the farmers in the province,
including the death rate of women in childbirth, infant mortality,
the incidence rate of the epidemic diseases, and the planned
vaccination of children, are all among the best in the country.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the health department of the province attributed
this to improved health care in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the province began to set up a network of basic rural
health care. Some 47 counties in the province, about three
quarters of the total, have reached the standard of basic health
care by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
About 30 million farmers in 23,000 administrative villages, or
57 percent of the province's total number of farmers, have
received better medical treatment through the co-operative
medicare system.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, over ten counties or cities at county level,
introduced a medical insurance system, which can help farmers
avoid impovrishment from massive medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, among the 870,000 people in Tongshan County, who have
joined the co-operative medicare system, 60 percent have part of
their medical expenses paid under the co-operative system. And 36
people have submitted 5,000 to 10,000 yuan of medical expenses,
and 16 people submitted more than 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Health care networks at the county, township, and village
levels are responsible for the prevention and treatment of common
diseases. Most of the farmers in the province's 35,000
administrative villages can see the doctor at clinics, built in
their own villages.
</P>
<P>
Many medical organizations established health records for the
farmers, and launched systematic management of the health care for
pregnant women, children, and for the anti-epidemic diseases
work.

PARIS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Marcelo Rios prevented a Spanish
sweep by beating Carlos Moya in straight sets in the semifinals of
the Monte Carlo Open in Monaco on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With a win of 6-4, 7-6, Rios became the first non-Spaniard this
season to qualify for a European clay court final wherein the
Chilean will meet 12th seed Spaniard Alex Corretja who beat local
hero Fabrice Santoro 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The previous two finals of the season were all between
Spaniards in the clay-court tournaments.
</P>
<P>
The match between Rios and Moya was much closer than the score
suggests, especially in a tense second set.
</P>
<P>
Moya rushed to the net to pressure Rios and the umpire
overruled a linesman's call which would have given Rios a victory
of 7-5.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Corretja reached his second ATP Tour final
in three weeks after winning in Estoril.
</P>
<P>
He proved stronger against Santoro and even rallied back from
1-4 down in the second set, ruining the Frenchman's hopes of
another upset in one hour and 38 minutes.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- All the favourites beat their
lower-ranked opponents to keep away upsets from the first-day
competition as the Ice Hockey World Championship started in Kurku,
Finland on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The winning stars blink for defending champions Czechs, Olympic
champions Sweden, 1994 world champions Canada and 1995 world
champions of Finland.
</P>
<P>
For the four matches unveiled of the day, Canada thrashed
Norway 7-0, Finland triumphed over France 6-1, Sweden outscored
Italy 5-3 and the Czechs rallied from behind to edge Germany 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Geoff Sanderson scored twice while Sean Burke and Rick

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A group of 25 incompetent
officials in Tianjin, a major port city in north China, recently
were dismissed from their posts, and 40 competent officials were
promoted, local official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 25 dismissed officials were working in the city's posts and
telecommunications departments and pharmaceutical firms, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
A local micro switchgear plant used to be a money-losing
factory. Four years ago, the workers' representatives congress
chosed Xu Baozhong, an ordinary worker, as the head. The factory
today not only made profits but also annexed another enterprise.
</P>
<P>
"After ordinary workers gave assessment to their heads, they
realized they are the masters of the enterprises, and their sense
of responsibility was enhanced," said Jin Sheng, chairman of the
trade union of the Lisheng pharmaceutical Plant.
</P>
<P>
"In past, I did little to my company, and the assessment given
by workers was fair to me," said Liu Wulin, one of those who have
been dismissed from their original posts.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics showed that nearly 60 percent of local
state-owned enterprises had carried out the assessment of their
officials.

RIO DE JANEIRO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazil has reduced the tax

<P>
The tax was reduced Friday from 7 percent to 2 percent for
short-term capitals, while those of medium and long term were
tax exempted, Loyola as quoted by the press.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Upsets Sweden as Waldner Fades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Belgium edged out
world runner-up Sweden 3-2 in their second-to-last Group B match
as world No. 2 Jan-Ove Waldner failed to find his form and flair
at the World Table Tennis Championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Philippe Saive, rated a joint 50th in the world, snatched
the deciding game against Waldner, virtually assuring Belgium a
quarter-final berth in the men's team competition.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, the only male in the world who has won the Olympic,
World Championship and World Cup singles titles, looked lackluster
throughout the day. Seven hours after being humiliated by
Vladimir Samsonov in Sweden's 3-2 victory over Belarus, the
31-year-old star fell apart under the barrages of Philippe Saive
and lost 21-9, 21-19.
</P>
<P>
"Waldner was just too nervous," said Belgian head coach Wang Da
Yong.
</P>
<P>
Jorgen Persson, world singles champion in 1991, beat Philippe
Saive 21-17, 21-15 in the opening game and Waldner downed
Philippe's elder brother Jean-Michael 21-17, 21-14 in a clash of
former world No. 1s.
</P>
<P>
Belgian veteran Andras Podpinka snapped the Swedes' winning
streak by stunning Peter Karlsson 21-14, 18-21, 22-20. Podpinka
had beaten Karlsson only once in their previous four encounters.
</P>
<P>
Michael Saive evened the score to 2-2, beating Persson 21-14,
17-21, 21-19 in the fourth game. The 28-year-old Belgian, who
pulled off a desperately aggressive game, dived like a soccer
goalie for a return to get himself 13-11 ahead in the deciding set.
</P>
<P>
The elder Saive continued to press on Persson, who made two
backhand errors to concede the match point.
</P>
<P>
Each with a lightweight rival to beat on Sunday, unbeaten
Belgium and Sweden, which has a 4-1 win-loss record, are expected
to finish first and second in the Group B. According the new
format, the winners from Group A to D go directly into the
quarter-finals while second and third finishers in these groups
have to vie for the remaining four berths with winners from Group
E to T.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, world No. 4 Samsonov routed Waldner in
straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, a player willing to rally until his rival leaves an
opening, changed the tactics and took initiative in attacking,
winning the second rubber against Waldner 21-6, 21-7 in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Waldner showed justifiable signs of nerves when Samsonov put up
a very aggressive game.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Belarussian, tipped as a favorite for the men's
singles championship, outlasted Persson in his second outing
before Waldner completed Sweden's 3-2 win by beating Evgueni
Chtchetinine 21-16, 21-18.
</P>
<P>
It was Samsonov's first win over Waldner since he upset the
Swede 3-1 in the Swedish Open final in December, 1995. Waldner
edged out Samsonov 3-2 in the World Cup last year and got the
better of the Belarussian again in the Qatar Open in February.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov showed his composure beyond years in the fourth game
against Persson, who won Sweden's first point by nipping Belarus'
defensive player Chtchetinine.
</P>
<P>
With one set down, Samsonov used his topspins and solid defence
to win two sets in a row. The score was 18-21, 21-19, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
Thomas von Scheele snatched the third game against Vitali
Nekhvedovitch, winning 21-10, 21-18.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has entered seven World Championship finals since the
1980s and won four, in 1983, 1989, 1991 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion China booked a quarter-final spot by beating
Yugoslavia 3-1 for their fourth straight victory in Group C.
Germany blanked South Korea 3-0, also securing a place in the last
eight.
</P>
<P>
In the women's team event, China, South Korea, Germany and
Romania, all unbeaten in the groups, have moved into the
quarter-finals on Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration is
pressing the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
to help strengthen the world-wide anti-bribery activities.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said he will raise the
issues at the meeting of G-7 finance ministers scheduled here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The United States is one of the few countries with laws against
using bribery to further business deals abroad.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States will urge the World Bank President
James Wolfensohn and IMF Managing Director, Michel Camdessus, "to
expand the scope of their anti-corruption activities."
</P>
<P>
"We urge the multilateral development banks to focus on
establishing uniform rules" for World Bank and IMF projects,
including a standard contract with a no-corruption pledge and
"strong headquarters oversight," Rubin noted.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also will urge members of the 29-nation Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to eliminate the tax
deductibility of bribing foreign officials and to make it a crime
under their laws. The question is expected come up at next month's
meeting of OECD ministers in Paris.
</P>
<P>
G-7 is made up of the 7 most industrial nations, i.e. Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S.

<HEADLINE> UK Opposition Party to Have Landslide Victory, Polls Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Opposition Labor Party leader Tony
Blair looks set to enter Downing Street on May 1 with the largest
parliamentary majority held by any party since the Second World
War, opinion polls suggested.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls in three British Sunday newspapers showed Labor's
lead ranging from 15 to 24 points, implying a minimum Labor
representation in the 659-seat Commons of more than 400 MPs and a
parliamentary majority approaching 200.
</P>
<P>
An ICM poll in the Observer, the biggest poll ever conducted by
a newspaper, saw Labor unchanged on 47 percent compared to the
Conservatives 32 percent. The third largest party Liberal
Democrats had 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Observer poll, taken in 16 marginal constituencies held by
the Conservatives, suggested that eight cabinet ministers could
lose their seats to Labor, which is out of power since 1979.
</P>
<P>
A MORI poll for the Sunday Mirror gave Labor a hefty 24-point
lead over the ruling Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
An NOP poll in the Sunday Times said a slight Conservative
revival in the past two weeks had come to a shuddering halt.
</P>
<P>
It put Labor 18 points ahead of the Conservatives, up four
points from last week and said that if the results were repeated
nationally Labor would win 422 seats in parliament compared to 165
for the Conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Vows to Remove Land mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee
of Red Cross today called for a global ban on the production,
stockpiling, transfer and use of all anti-personnel mines, saying
that mines are increasingly used to terrorize civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
According to the Red Cross mission to the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), some 120 million active mines are scattered
in over 70 countries, one for every 16 children or 48 human
beings on the planet.
</P>
<P>
The countries infested with land mines include Angola,
Mozambique, Somalia and Sudan in Africa, Cambodia, Afghanistan,
Viet Nam and Iraq in Asia and Bosnia and Croatia in Europe and
others.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross said mines are indiscriminate in terms of target
and time. They go on killing and maiming soldiers and civilians,
men and women, adults and children alike, decades after the
fighting has ended.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 800 people were killed and 1,200
maimed every single month, which means one victim every 20
minutes. Many mine victims, usually civilians, never receive any
medical care and half of all victims are believed to die within
minutes of the blast.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the mines are increasing every year on the
planet with each year some 100,000 mines removed but two million
more planted.
</P>
<P>
It is a formidable work to clear mines on the planet.
According to the Red Cross, mines cost 3 to 30 U.S. Dollars each,
however, clearing a mine costs 50 times as much.
</P>
<P>
Removing the world's 120 million active mines could cost up to
33 billion U.S. Dollars. At current rates of progress, it would
take 1,100 years to clear the entire world of mines.

PARIS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The British Airways today refused
to share the luggage belt with Air Algeria in a terminal of the
Roissy-Charles de Gaulles airport of Paris, and transported 450 of
its passengers by Euro-star train from Paris to London.
</P>
<P>
The action by British Airways is apparently a surprise for
French officials, who said that London airports have never
separated Air Algeria from other air companies.
</P>
<P>
Citing security reasons, the British Airways said that it is
resorting to legal action to pressure the authorities in charge of
of airports of Paris to separate it from Air Algeria, which
resumed its Algiers-Paris flight on Friday after a two-year
suspension.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of British Airways said that his company today also
transferred two of its passenger planes to the Orly airport to
avoid using the same luggage belt with Air Algeria.
</P>
<P>
He said that Air Algeria is a "high risk company" which can
be targeted by terrorist attacks, and pointed out that Air Algeria
is separated from other air companies in Marseille airports.
</P>
<P>
The British Transport Secretary Sir George Young has also
written to his French counterpart Bernard Pons expressing his
concern.
</P>
<P>
But the French government said today that all security
arrangements have been made to guarantee the security of all air
companies after Air Algeria resumed its flight from Paris.

Refugees to abandon its plan to repatriate these refugees back to
Rwanda, and instead evacuate them to a third country other than
Zaire or Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"These refugees should be received provisionally in a country
of the region, other than Zaire and Rwanda, where their security
can be guaranteed," said the MSF.
</P>

The MSF Friday accused the Zairian rebels of following a
strategy of "physical elimination" of the refugees in eastern

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes EU for Siding with German Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran has stepped up criticism of
the European Union (EU) for backing a German court ruling three
days ahead of an EU meeting to review relations with the Islamic
Republic.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
today, Tehran sent a letter Friday to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, condemning the EU position as "harmful to the peace and
security of the world."
</P>
<P>
The German court ruled on April 10 that the Iranian leadership
was behind the 1992 killing of four Kurdish dissidents in
Berlin. Tehran has strongly denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Most EU countries recalled their ambassadors from Tehran for
consultations and froze critical negotiations with Iran shortly
after the court verdict was handed down.
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by Iran's deputy representative at the
United Nations Majid Takhtravanchi, said the court ruling was
"baseless and impudent."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the EU countries will meet in Luxembourg to assess
their policies toward Iran, which was believed to have tried to
maintain good relations with the EU in the wake of U.S. sanctions
against the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Neither the EU countries seemed ready to give up their
important market shares in Iran. Berlin has declared that it
remains opposed to efforts to isolate Iran despite the recent
tension in their relations.

construction as the central task while adhering to the four
cardinal principles and persevering in reform and opening-up

and law front, he had made outstanding contributions to
establishing and perfecting the system of the people's congresses,
strengthening and consolidating the political power of people's

<HEADLINE> French Communist Party Calls for Real Leftist Alternative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The national secretary of the
French Communist Party (PCF) Robert Hue today called for the
presentation of a real leftist alternative by the Socialist Party
and its leftist allies in the coming legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
In his first public appearance of legislative campaign in
Argenteuil, northwest of Paris, Hue told about 300 supporters that
an alternative project by the leftist parties should be, "without
ambiguity, a real project of the left."
</P>
<P>
"What do we propose to (Prime Minister) Juppe? Restriction, a
smoked herring," he said in response to a statement by Juppe made
on Thursday in Marseille that the Socialist Party and the
Communist Party can only serve a plate of small beans to the
French.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first secretary of the Socialist Party Lionel
Jospin today hinted that if his party wins the legislative
elections, it could take in PCF members into a new government.
</P>
<P>
"What is the problem? It was possible in 1945 with General de
Gaulle and in 1981 with Francois Mitterrand," said Jospin in a
television interview.
</P>
<P>
PCF members served as government ministers under President
Charles de Gaulled after World War II and under President Francois
Mitterrand in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Hue and Jospin will meet on Tuesday next week to discuss a
common line by their two parties in the general elections
scheduled for May 25 and June 1.

He said that Comrade Deng Xiaoping had said that adherence to
"one central task and two basic points" (taking economic
development as the central task and upholding reform and
opening-up policy and the four cardinal principles) is the basic
line of the CPC. The Party should concentrate on securing a faster
and better economic development, give full play to the fine
tradition of the CPC, and pay equal attention to the development
of both material and ideological progress. Since reform and
opening to the outside world is to emancipate and promote
productive forces, so China should stick to them until the
realization of communism.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Peng Zhen firmly supported and upheld the principles
and policies adopted since the 14th National Congress of the CPC
Central Committee, and highly praised the achievements that the
Party has made since its 14th National Congress.
</P>
<P>
During his 70-odd years of revolutionary career, Comrade Peng
Zhen had firm belief in communism, showed utmost loyalty to the
Party, the people and the cause of proletarian revolution, and
kept fighting indomitably in spite of twists and turns.
